,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,I've been here a few times during dinner time but I came here later than normal past 9pm for dinner.  We easily got seated inside.  I wanted to try the crispy chicken sammie which wasn't available so I ordered the jap chae with a goat burger added on. 
,,,,,I ended up getting the wrong order so I had to wait for my order. I don't mind waiting for food but JP our waiter was joking around with us and nice which was a nice distraction for my loud stomach groans. 
,,,,,The jap chae was a different take on the original version and the glass noodle was more brown and seasoned. It was a bit more seasoned than my liking but it was delicious.  I'm glad I got the goat burger which was topped with a sunny side up egg. I would recommend the jap chae but I would add some protein. 
,,,,,"With some of the wait JP treated us to a pretzel ice cream sundae amazingness. Having the mix of caramel,  crunchy pretzels was a perfect flavor/texture combo. I couldn't get enough and I'm glad I saved room for dessert.  Check out my picture! It was sooo good I would come by just to have it!"
,,,,,"The bullseye French toast is my dream meal - it's amazing. I had it the first year they were open and it was with gooseberries which was mind-blowing. It's been topped with strawberries every time since. I hope they bring the gooseberries back some day. But either way, it's delicious. I love taking friends here. It feels unique and fun without being intimidating."
,,,,,We rented the room upstairs for about 40 people and the execution and food was so thoughtful! We enjoyed drinks on our private deck overlooking Chicago and then were brought back into the dining room where the chefs prepared food in our own kitchen. 
,,,,,"Some folks, including me, were slated to have the vegetarian version of the menu and it was so good that all the meat eaters asked to have a second taste of my dishes! While others had scallops I had the falafel. It looked and was plated exactly like the scallops and it was the best falafel I've had in my life. My main dish was some oriental sesame and avocado garlic noodles and on of my guests put down his salmon and had to force me to give him a second go at my dish! All 40 people raved about the food and dessert and all 40 got their appetizers, drinks, dishes (sea bass, short ribs, scallops), desserts in perfect harmony. The service was friendly and worked like a synchronized swim team. "
,,,,,"This place specializes in meat dishes. But, if their vegetarian dishes for me were THAT good, imagine how good their specialty dishes are."
,,,,,We were visiting my home state to see family but stopped at chicago to explore and sight see. Several friends recommended this place to us and it did not disappoint!
,,,,,All of the entrees we ordered was bursting with flavor and life!!!
,,,,,"I seriously felt regret that I wouldn't have the time nor the stomach room to try everything on the menu. We got the burrito, shrimp and grits and banh mi burger."
,,,,,"We all loved it and I loved it so much, I bought both of the chef's cookbooks, on display in their bakery next door, later on after my trip."
,,,,,I look forward to hopefully being able to come back again. The cinnamon roll that came out to the table next to us looked absolutely amazing and is on my top-to-do list next time I am in the area.
,,,,,Oh my goodness.  Please go and go hungry.  The staff is super nice and helpful with wavering decisions.  Get the fat Elvis and you will not be upset.  Yes...I ate the entire thing!!!  So so good and wonderfully balanced.
,,,,,All three of us enjoyed something different but I do have to say that the fat Elvis was the best!!
,,,,,You will have to wait likely so allow some time to enjoy the surroundings and chat with friends!!
,,,,,"Overall, I was really disappointed with Little Goat Diner. We came here after learning that both Girl & The Goat and Au Cheval had 2+ hour waits, and we were starving. Unfortunately, even our hunger could not disguise the quality of the food. :( "
,,,,,"+ Chocolate Goat Milk - I was really excited for this because I love goat products, but this tasted like chocolate cow milk. I felt very silly paying so much for what basically tastes like normal chocolate milk. "
,,,,,"+ Crab Dip - The dip wasn't bad flavor-wise (arguably the best thing we got here) but even though the dish was hot, the dip inside was still cold. It was definitely full of crabmeat and was tasty, but it would've been exponentially better if it had been warm. The crackers on the side were basically Ritz crackers - very uniform and buttery. The waitress kindly offered us a second batch of crackers when she noticed that we were low, but the second batch was all super crumbly and fragile; they all broke immediately when we tried to dip them. "
,,,,,"+ All-American Burger - Their special sauce tastes remarkably like McDonald's special sauce. The resemblance to a Big Mac flavor-wise was utterly uncanny. It tastes good, but that was really strange ... unless they mean to imply that McDonald's represents ""All-American""? "
,,,,,"+ Shrimp, Pork Belly, Zucchini and Shrimpy Noodles - Aside from the tender, tasty pork belly, this was unpalatable. I was shocked by this horrible rendition of an Asian-inspired dish (would not have gotten it if it had said that on the menu) - the noodles and veggies were drowning in ginger and soy sauce. The shrimp was overcooked and the veggies were ruined by the overpowering sauce. "
,,,,,"The crab dip was very filling, which was a good thing because I really could not make myself eat the shrimp/pork belly disaster that I got. I probably should've stuck with something goat, so I guess that's my fault. Service was very slow. "
,,,,,"On the plus side, there is a Pokemon Gym here; I battled it and raised it several levels while waiting for our food."
,,,,,Hash browns - Shredded and so good! Crispy all around and had cheese in it. I've never had better hash browns and I don't think I will ever have better. 
,,,,,"Goat chili - I hate beans so obviously I am biased when I say I wasn't impressed, but my boyfriend loves chili and he still wasn't impressed. I think it was a little too sour. It was topped with lettuce (maybe) and sour cream. The one good thing I have to say about it is that there was a lot of meat in it. "
,,,,,"Bloody Mary - Ketel one vodka and some type of kimchi infused whatever. This was good, but I've had better. The kimchi made this a little more sour than I would have liked and it was not spicy at all. "
,,,,,In a Pickle - this was a tequila cocktail. My bf said it just tasted like tequila with a lot of lime. 
,,,,,"Bulls eye French toast - I hate to be the only one to dog on this, but I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would. The French toast was soaked in the BBQ maple syrup so it was soggy and the only soggy thing I like is French fries from McDonald's. The chicken was fried nicely and the egg in the brioche was cooked perfectly. "
,,,,,"Bi bim bop - cauliflower rice, fancy bacon (what the waitress called it), a fried egg, asome other stuff. I thought this was way too sour. There were bean sprouts, pickled purple cabbage, and mushrooms in it as well. I also didn't think there was enough bacon in it to say it had bacon in it on the menu. "
,,,,,"My first two choices were sold out, so... maybe I would have been more impressed with Little Goat if I had gotten that. Such a shame because I absolutely love Girl and the Goat."
,,,,,I've been here a couple of times and I'm never disappointed. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great. I think it's lovely how they have incredibly a sweet and rich breakfasts available and on the other side savory foods that I wouldn't have been willing to try somewhere else.
,,,,,"Omg this place was so delicious!! One of many stops on our day adventure, we decided to break for lunch and stop in. All of us got a variety of dishes but I got the shrimp salad that had apples, red peppers, blueberries, tortilla bits and so much flavor. Every bite had a great combination of citrus flavor, shrimp and crunch. The salad mix of arugula and spinach provided a nice bitter counter balance and nothing was wilted or spoiled."
,,,,,The service was delightful with our server offering wine suggestions and joking with our party. Each of my friends dishes were just as flavorful and some had a more savory twist. If you want to eat great food and enjoy all the little goat decals then this is your place. The wide windows will give you lots of Vitamin D. You can't go wrong!
,,,,,Ok so I treated myself to brunch on my birthday. It was a random choice based on Yelp reviews and recommendations. I couldn't have been happier with this choice.
,,,,,"I originally wanted to get the Bull's Eye French toast. But my server informed me that the egg couldn't be cooked any other way, and I didn't want the runny egg in the toast. So I chose the Fat Elvis waffle, with cheese grits and sausage. It was phenomenal. The portions were plentiful and super flavorful."
,,,,,"My server was also very attentive and wanted to make sure the choice was a good one. So pleased with this place, I can't wait to return and try another entree."
,,,,,One thing I liked about this spot is that there's a bar attached and it was very nice. I waited there until my table was ready. The bathrooms are clean and the restaurant is generally very well maintained. I consider it upscale casual dining as advertised. Definitely try it.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,I've been to Little Goat Diner a few times now.  It's a fun spot in the West Loop that's family friendly.
,,,,,I've always gone for brunch and I've had a pleasant experience. I highly recommend the pancakes and the paratha burrito! 
,,,,,"Cons: If you come on the later side of brunch, they tend to run out of items. Also, when their kitchen is closing they rush you to order. We were seated and 10 minutes later were asked to place an order soon because the kitchen was closing. "
,,,,,"Overall, I highly recommend LGD. They have a great desserts and coffee."
,,,,,"I only like a few things from here: ooey gooey cinnabun, parathas burrito, and the shrimp sandwich. Things that I've tried and that I don't care for: little piggy went to china, breakfast tasty thing, biscuits and gravy, los drowned, fish tostadas, tempura mashed potatoes, springy shrimp & pork belly."
,,,,,I come here pretty much only for an early morning breakfast or to pick up a cinnabun. I've given up on their lunch and dinner.
,,,,,"If you can't get into Girl & Goat, you gotta try this place! Or even if you can, try this place too. You will still probably want to get a reservation though as it was pretty busy. Sat at the bar area and kept it pretty simple with a Lilypad drink and the chickpea - kale salad. For a salad, it was amazing. All of the ingredients went together so well! I wanted to try so much more on the menu as they serve breakfast all day! Can't wait to go back and try the waffles the lady next to me was having! :)"
,,,,,Such a great spot for wonderful food and a really good atmosphere. The prices are reasonable as well! Love taking visitors here!
,,,,,"Great service, the waitress suggested the bulls eye french toast when I told her I wanted something filling, sweet and with egg. It was soooo good, fluffy french toast, the chicken was grilled and sweet and the hidden egg was phenomenal. Would definitely get this again."
,,,,,"First of all, the decor and atmosphere is so perfect. I love the vibe of this diner! My group sat at a shared table with no wait, but the place was so packed. There are so many options on the menu and coming here for a late lunch, we were starving. My family ordered The Fat Club, The Tonkatsu, and the Goat Chili. Everything was so delicious and the portion sizes are huge. As busy as it as, the service was still excellent. We never had to wait for anyone to come to our table. I would highly recommend paying a visit to Little Goat Diner. You won't leave hungry or unsatisfied."
,,,,,"Amazing, affordable brunch spot in Chicago and definitely worth a visit. Little Goat is a diner by the same chefs as Girl and the Goat."
,,,,,My boyfriend and I walked here after hearing the wait at Au Cheval was an hour plus long and were so glad we walked into Little Goat with no wait.
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,"- Korean Burger ($14), 5/5 stars."
,,,,,"- Tempura Mashed Potatoes ($6), 5/5 stars. Sounds weird, but worth a try."
,,,,,"- Bull's Eye French Toast ($16) per the recommendation of Yelp, 4/5 stars. I got tired of it after just a few bites. Didn't like the strawberries on it."
,,,,,Great portions for the price. Excited to try Girl and the Goat now.
,,,,,Seriously won't get better comfort food anywhere!! Love this little gem!! 
,,,,,Not always easy to get in!!
,,,,,"Worth the wait, and has a little bar at tar he'd that you can also eat at! "
,,,,,Solid menu and perfectly cooked and served with a smile for a very fair price!!
,,,,,"I wasn't able to get a reservation at Girl and a Goat so I decided to try out Chef Stephanie Izard's other restaurant, Little Goat Diner. It definitely did not disappoint."
,,,,,"The first thing the server told me was that everything on the menu was available. That's wonderful news for anyone that loves breakfast items anytime of the day! That person isn't me however, but good to know :) I was torn between the Korean Burger or Shrimp & Pork Belly Noodles based on reviews I read. The server recommended the Korean Burger so that's what I went with. I avoid ordering anything spicy whenever I can but.... it was my first trip (of many I hope) to Chicago and I rarely eat goat meat... so I was sold."
,,,,,"The burger was delicious, a little on the spicy side but I managed. Sometimes it's worth all the sweat and discomfort! I also ordered the sweet corn elotes on the side. At first I was hesitant because of the cayenne butter but figured I was all in at this point with the spice level. No problems there because I almost ate the whole side dish before I even touched my burger."
,,,,,I managed to save a little room for dessert and was glad I ordered the french silk pie. AMAZING!
,,,,,I also tried the Moscow Goat since it had grapefruit in it. A nice twist on the Moscow Mule.
,,,,,I came to this spot after having tried Girl and the Goat the night before. They are owned by the same chef and are across the street from each other. 
,,,,,"The menu offers dishes for the adventurous palate (but also has ""safer"" options as well). They offer classic dishes with their own twist, such as chicken and french toast instead of waffles, or the sloppy goat and goat chili. It's also more affordable than Girl and the Goat and portions seem more generous. "
,,,,,"I personally ordered the okonomiyaki, a Japanese savory pancake with pork belly, topped with an egg and drizzled with sauces similar to what you'd find on takoyaki. Pancake itself was so soft and burst with flavors. I also tried my mom's dish, This Little Piggy Went to China. It reminded me of an Asian inspired eggs benedict. It's a bit on the salty side, but I love salty so fine by me. "
,,,,,"Great customer service from our waitress, who had such an upbeat energy and answered all our questions. Would definitely recommend this spot to anyone."

,,,,,"This place never disappoints! Love their ribs here, but everything is yummy. The pecan bread pudding is sinfully delicious too. The food is worth standing in line for."
,,,,,Great brisket in Chicago! The long lines and tight seating spaces are worth it if you are looking for a hearty meal.
,,,,,I did a catering order for 40 people ordered 11 slabs of rib two trays of mac and cheese and some brisket.
,,,,,We picked up the order because the delivery prices were pretty steep. But service was great! And the food even better :-) they give you a generous portion of barbecue sauce for the ribs in the brisket. The containers that they put the food in to keep it warm are excellent.
,,,,,I will definitely be catering from them again.
,,,,,The shredded brisket was amazing. Great flavor. I had the corn bread with Mac n cheese on the side. Everything was delicious. The French fries are fresh cut and soooo good. We will definitely go back

,,,,,"During Covid, I've really missed great BBQ. Maybe that's why my sliced brisket sandwich tasted so good, or maybe its because Smoque is just so damn good!  The ordering and curbside pickup was smooth and efficient. Staff was properly masked.  Everything was perfect. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,Quick and delicious. So many people recommend this place to me because I live in the area. 
,,,,,"Decent outdoor seating and the ribs were, of course, some of the best in the city"
,,,,,Wow!!! Where do I start?
,,,,,"First of all, my first exposure to Smoque BBQ was when my employer hired them to cater our 'indoor' barbeque.   That was the first time I had that scrumptious and tender and juicy Brisket.    OMG!!!"
,,,,,"Other co workers liked the barbeque chicken and pulled pork but I kept getting more brisket.  Anyone who knows me, knows I am a meat and meat and meat and potato girl.  So I kindof sampled their Mac N Cheese, Cole Slaw (which was more on the vinegar side) and Corn bread.   All sides were good."
,,,,,"But I want to mention, my employer paid extra for Smoque to come and cater / serve their meals.  I highly recommend paying the extra money.   They have that process down to a SCIENCE.  Very detailed, clean, organized and they even pack up any leftovers with labels.   How awesome is that?"
,,,,,"But today, my husband and I finally W`E`N`T to Smoque.   Yes, I was warned that their place is small and to avoid busy meal times.   So, of course, we went around 12:30pm.  Oh well.   But while we were waiting in line to order, a gentleman asked how many in our party.  I'm so glad they did not place that burden on us.  This way, they had an employee looking for seating for any guests who were dining.   And before our number was even called, this gentleman had found a seat for us."
,,,,,"Keep in mind, you will get to sit closer to the people next to you.  But I do not think you will be bothered to carry a conversation because all of us were busy eating this awesome barbeque meal."
,,,,,"The staff at Smoque was so nice.  Even when I asked for a 'to go' container, the young lady asked me if I wanted a bag.  Very thoughtful.  I also appreciate that they cleaned the table each time before a new guest sat down.   "
,,,,,"Well, I left there stuffed and I think I am still stuffed hours later.   But by next week, I hope my husband asks me, ""Hey do you want to go to Smoque?""   And before he finishes his question, I will be in the car---waiting in the passenger seat."
,,,,,Woah! This place is on FIYAH!
,,,,,"In honor of July 4th, why not talk about some good ol' fashion Chicago BBQ?"
,,,,,Brisket. Ribs. Slaw. What more could you ask for in one of the city's best BBQ spots?
,,,,,"My friend and I decided to come here for our monthly get-together. This time, we were down to take the Blue Line all the way up to Irving Park to try this place. On a Thursday evening, it wasn't packed at all. You go in, order at the counter, and then take a seat."
,,,,,"Each of us opted for the St. Louis Ribs ($16) and the Sliced Brisket ($14), and shared the meat. Mmm, the brisket here was definitely on point! It fell apart so easily, so you know it was very much on the tender side. We ordered our ribs dry-rub with their Memphis and Carolina sauces on the side. It was delicious as well, but I think I prefer the brisket. As for dipping sauce, the Carolina was definitely my choice- sweet and tangy!"
,,,,,"The platters each come with two individual sides, and hands down our favorites were the baked beans and the mac & cheese. I've never tasted beans like these before. They were smoky and downright delicious! As for the later, the baked layer of crust on top was perfect in trapping the cheesy goodness underneath."
,,,,,"Smoque BBQ definitely reigns high on my list of fantastic meats in Chicago. Plus, it's BYOB (on the casual mind you- don't try to get too hammered in here), so pick out a nice beer to enjoy with your smokin' meal."
,,,,,Oh dang! Those crispy tacos were perfect. If only it came with 4 I would not have started eating my kids delicious fries  We will definitely be back  I highly recommend this restaurant.
,,,,,"I was underwhelmed with their bbq'd meats.  And walking into the place, thought it was ok.  Kind of divey which is kool.  The sides were solid.  Atmosphere was fun.  We got there just in time to beat the rush bc the line was out the door.  Maybe I was disappointed bc there was so much hype about this place.  My expectations were pretty high.  Not a place I'd visit again.  I was visiting from NY and had a better experience at another bbq joint."

,,,,,YUM! I was in town visiting my sister and we came for their weekend brunch. 
,,,,,"5 star service. Our server (I forget their name unfortunately, but they had a slick side shave) was an all-star and very attentive. They knew bunches about the menu and made sure we were ordering the right number of tapas."
,,,,,"3.75 star food. The food itself was pretty good, but some items were not worth it, inspiring me to write this review."
,,,,, 
,,,,,Worth it:
,,,,,*breakfast paella (huuuge serving & tasty) 
,,,,,*chorizo dates
,,,,,*stuffed mushrooms
,,,,,Save your $$:
,,,,,*deviled egg (literally half an egg... nothing special)
,,,,,"*waffle battered chicken (served in syrup, so they were very soggy)"
,,,,,"We came to Baba Reba for a Christmas Eve dinner. You have to make reservations to come here because it's packed. The food was amazing! We ordered croquettes, Spanish omelette, avocado toast, steak, sangria, and the lavender cocktail and everything was delicious!! We came with a 4 year old and there were options for her there as well. Our waitress, Corinna, was so sweet and fast and all of our food came out on time. The plating was beautiful also. I would recommend this to anyone!"
,,,,,"I've always absolutely loved this place, and my most recent experience even further amplified my adoration for it. They gave us free gift cards, merchandise, AND covered our entire meal after one of their waitresses accidentally spilled a drink on one of my friends. It was a complete and total accident, and nobody was upset, but they made sure to do anything they could to mitigate discomfort on our end. I would've recommend this place to anyone prior to this incident, but this just confirmed how great it is. Best customer service ever!"
,,,,,"First and foremost, I don't care how good the food is but the customer service I initially received was horrible. I've worked in customer service for years and the first impression I received was absolute trash. From what I can tell customers were for the most part were dressed casual. My friend and I were dressed casual, a little on the nerd side. I have checked for reservations since noon and saw that there were reservations around 3pm and 6pm available. So around 2pm we walked a mile to see if we can score a walk in. The lady who greeted us told us the next reservation wasn't till 9:15pm. Then she tells us to check the bar to see if there is any spots. There were spots but they were single seaters by the bar. Now that really ticked me off. Normally, the employees would offer to look for spots but to have customers look for their own seating Especially for an establishment of nearly 5000 Yelp reviews and four stars. That really was the tipping point for this review. "
,,,,,What really baffled me throughout the night was I continued to see online reservation times before 915pm.
,,,,,I've been really looking forward to trying this place for months but not this year. Will come back on my next visit to Chicago to try the food. Hopefully next time the customer service will be at least decent.
,,,,,"Went yesterday night with my coworkers and omg was this place amazing! The Brussels sprout salad, the spicy potatoes, the bread., the dates!!! .. everything we had was so delicious. I would def have to try a paella next time! This was the place I've only heard great things about, and yesterday was my first time here. My new fav spot! Already planning on returning with some friends! Also the sangria was amazing. We tried like 3 flavors. And customer service was stellar!"
,,,,,"This is our favorite tapas place in the area, we used to go for brunch tapas and LOVED it! Service was always great and it was super kid friendly -- they gave the best bendable wax things to kiddos to play with while waiting for food."
,,,,,We got takeout/pickup over the weekend and I wasn't sure if tapas would be a good carryout food. 
,,,,,"We ordered the chicken paella, wrapped dates (the single ones--they were MASSIVE and wrapped in ham which we didn't remember from our dining in days but would order again), and patatas bravas. Just those items were A TON of food for 2 adults and we had paired down our order. We even had leftover paella. Additionally we got the red sangria which we loved getting it when we dined in pre-pandemic, and it tasted the EXACT same. Overall, a good experience and we will order again!"
,,,,,"Went here for a date with my husband. We were seated immediately but unfortunately sat at some kind of elevated nook by the bar. Though I had a bit of difficulty getting up to my seat (I'm 5'1"") I thought it was a cute unique dinning experience. My husband who is 5'7"" was not feeling it. His legs did not fit comfortably. The places was book so we decided to make the book work. The service was fantastic and we loved everything we ordered especially the dates and the goat cheese bake!"
,,,,,"From the moment you enter the place, you already have an idea that it will be a great timing for you. "
,,,,,I've dined in here many times and never been disappointed. The food and service are always great but my experience with their take out was phenomenal. 
,,,,,Very cool ambiance. 
,,,,,"Those times when I was there with a group of friends that was an amazing times and I mentioned that just to give you an advice that, try to visit here grouply cuz you may enjoy it much more. Or you could have a date here it'll work too."
,,,,,"I'm updating my review, since my last visit, Chris reached out to me asking if I wanted to provide more feedback, then they called and said they wanted to improve and that they had cleared things with the staff. They offered a complimentary gift card hoping us to have a different experience."
,,,,,"We did a reservation under a dif name, host, server and bussers* where really nice, and we were able to enjoy our favorite seafood paella, along with delicious tapas and sangria. "
,,,,,"Their croquettes are the best, you can never go wrong with bacon wrapped dates, and the grilled iberico pork with chimichurri is tasty. "
,,,,,*Bussers are always my fav staff
,,,,,Would have been nice to be told until what time you can order paella.
,,,,,"We went to celebrate a birthday, I had to call and push reservation to 8:45, for unforeseen closure of the expressway. "
,,,,,If they had told me when I called to move the reservation that you can not order paella past 8:30 I would have order for pickup or delivery. 
,,,,,"Tapas were ok. Shot out to the busser, he was the nicest."
,,,,,Delicious!!!!
,,,,,Goat cheese and marinara 
,,,,,The beef
,,,,,The mushrooms
,,,,,Sooo good !!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,I'm speechless in this review. The server was insanely knowledgeable and kind. The food was outstanding and lived up to fine the dining experience.
,,,,,My new favorite restaurant. 
,,,,,Great meat.  Bernaise and a seasoning on the size to shake things up. 
,,,,,Great service.  House wines were excellent.  Full bodied.  
,,,,,Great chocolate cream pie dessert. 
,,,,,Ambiance was dark and they were playing old jazz.  Real candles.  A nice touch. 
,,,,,My server was terrific.  Helpful. Made suggestions.  Told me when I was going to make a mistake.  
,,,,,Ribeye cooked perfectly.
,,,,,"Best steak, sides, cocktails and service I've had in years. BearnaiseFilet MignonTruffle MacWedge Salad all delicious. Service was wonderful. Also, freshly baked bread amazing."
,,,,,"The steak tartare with the egg and toast is amazing! Best I've ever had. I was not a big fan of the bone in ribeye however, I loved the sides; mashed potatoes and the mushrooms were nice. Wedge salad was OK but the thick cut bacon was amazing. The vibe there is really great, the staff is nice and the music is awesome, heard some 90's hip-hop. Upstairs has a super cool bar and seating but downstairs is a hidden gem. Vintage lighting and artifacts  throughout the restaurant. The dim lighting and glass chandeliers are nice upstairs! I will definitely be going back and want to try the fillet next but I'm trying to eat steak only once a month. High cholesterol problems! Great night at Bavettes, thanks for the hospitality."
,,,,,"I confess, I have a secret love affair with this beautiful restaurant! Its been 4-years & still going strong! Shhhh... It's cozy, it's swanky, it's loaded with the kind of energy that lures you in and begs you to stay! A true must-go experience."
,,,,,"Upon entry, you will be promptly greeted by the host and invited to check in your coats. As you step into the foyer there's a vintage red velvet couch, dimly lit ambiance, exposed brick walls, and an elaborately decorated extensive bar with some of the most personable and professional bartenders I've met in all of River North! I'd highly recommend trying a signature pickle-back (I know it sounds odd  but if you like pickles, this is quite a zing!)."
,,,,,"For my fellow foodie friends, yes even though the steaks are unbelievably mouthwatering good, I do encourage you to look past the obvious drooling options on the menu and try the beef stroganoff (I literally crave this dish & it never fails to satisfy) paired with a full bodied red and order generously on the side dishes (most meals come a la carte). "
,,,,,"Expect your water & wine glasses will never see empty, your linen napkins will be replaced should you get up from the table, and crumbs swept away between servings. It's this level of attentiveness that makes you feel like a pampered patron & who doesn't want that right?"
,,,,,"I will say, reservations are highly recommended and almost necessary because it's always busy (I use OpenTable) and justifiably so! Most guests dress up a notch or are coming directly from work and tend to be a more established professional crowd. Pricing is on par with all other steakhouses in the city but IMO offers one of the highest quality dining experiences without the pretense or snobbery. "
,,,,,"Pictures in this case will lure you here but they cannot replace the in person experience! Just go, you won't regret one bite of all the goodness! Bavette's may just become your obsession too:)"
,,,,,"One other point worth mention: After dinner, go downstairs - it's a speakeasy with all the sultry Vibes! Perfect for a sinful dessert or nightcap."
,,,,,"I went here for my boyfriend's birthday, and all of the food was really really good! We did a whole spread! We got the baked crab cakes, dry aged bone-in ribeye, brussel sprouts for the side, and white fish salad that was on the specials menu. My gosh, everything was so absolutely delicious! In our opinion though, the baked crab cakes were the star of our dinner! Do not sleep on those baked crab cakes!! Also I must add that the service here was amazing!"
,,,,,"I've been waiting to get the chance to go to Bavette's for quite a few years now. I made it a point to get a reservation for my birthday. I made the reservation a couple of months in advance, and I definitely specified that I wanted a table on the lower level. This was a good choice. "
,,,,,"The lower level is definitely more quiet and intimate than the upper level. It feels like you are in a speakeasy, but the part where they hide all of the liquor. It is very dark downstairs, and everything is lit by candles. There's a mixture of couches and booths to sit at. There's a small bar, and the ambient soundtrack helps to set the mood. It is a pretty stark contrast from the upstairs, but the levels complement each other, nonetheless. "
,,,,,"The service is insanely attentive. The drinks are absolutely delicious-definitely try something with whiskey. I also like their wine policy-if you go you'll see. It's a nice, friendly touch and makes you feel like you are eating dinner among friends. "
,,,,,"The steak. If you come here and don't get steak, you're doing it wrong. The aged ribeye is definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides are huge and definitely shareable too. The creamed spinach and mac & cheese went perfectly with the steak. We also received a complementary dessert with a sparkler on top. Extra tastiness. "
,,,,,"Yes, the bill was a bit high, but I felt like it was completely worth it. I will definitely make it a point to come back."
,,,,,"Love the ambiance!  The atmosphere and vibe was exactly what we were looking for on our trip to Chicago. The staff and servers were all great. Attentive to every detail - keeping our glasses full, taking away plates, giving us new utensils, knowledgeable with the food and bar menu. "
,,,,,"Got the dry aged ribeye, petite duchess filet, and the Chicago cut ribeye. All three were great quaolit steaks and huge portions, but extremely salty for our tastes. You can definitely taste the nuttiness of the 42 days of dry aging. The bread was worth the carbs. Crusty on the outside, springy soft on the inside. "
,,,,,"Elote corn was the only disappointment when it came to sides. It tasted like corns kernels stewed in rotelle and velveeta - kids said it looked like spicy Mac and cheese made of corn.  Roasted bone marrow was awesome, along with the truffle Mac and cheese. Pomme frites aren't the thin long light fries you'd expect from the name - more steak fries :( "
,,,,,"We were so fully we only ordered one dessert and it was a lighter one. It was good though, no complaints there. "
,,,,,Disappointed with the old fashion. With four different types of Old Fashion - you think they were the experts. Wrong type of ice and just wasn't tasty. House red wine wasn't bad - smooth albeit the flavor was watered down. 
,,,,,Overall we loved the place (even with the few disappointments). The place definitely has a great vibe and service was excellent!
,,,,,Bavette's is a date night requirement in Chicago! 
,,,,,"You'll be greeted immediately with a very friendly host stand, and seating at cozy booths and tables in an intimate, low-lit, swanky, jazz-club-like steakhouse. With delicious cocktails and an incredible sourdough bread that will threaten your high-hopes for dessert, you'll already be glad you came within the first few minutes of arrival. "
,,,,,"My date ordered the dry-aged ribeye, his first try of a dry-aged steak, and absolutely loved it. I went a little off the beaten path choosing their spice fried chicken over a steak, and it was the best choice I've made in quite a while. The chicken was juicy, mashed potatoes flavorful, and both served with a delicious gravy and peas combo which was to die for! I will absolutely be ordering it again! Both were large portions, and we were thoroughly impressed with our meal and our service throughout. "
,,,,,Note-- Reservations are a must if you're looking for weekend dinner hours! I cannot wait to go back!
,,,,,Wonderful change of pace from traditional steakhouses. Romantic dark French style. 
,,,,,Disliked the banquette seating. You're in a  gorgeous dining room but staring at a brick wall. Come on guys; add a mirror or something. 
,,,,,Oysters fresh and nicely cleaned and presented. 
,,,,,Bone in filet excellent. A beautiful cut of beef perfectly prepared. And that's a ribeye guy talking. 
,,,,,"""Split"" a loaded baked potato and were presented two baked potatoes, loaded of course, served together in a small skillet. Tasty and nicely done, just silly big even for two people. "
,,,,,A charming and different steakhouse than the usual men's club. Would definitely return. But I gotta ding them a star for the banquette seating. Really. It spoils the ambiance for half of us.

,,,,,World class museum. Been one of my favorite places anywhere for my entire life.  There is always something new to discover and the special exhibits are great.
,,,,,World-Class.
,,,,,If you hear a voice within you say 
,,,,,"'you cannot paint,' then by all means"
,,,,,"paint, and that voice will be silenced... "
,,,,,Vincent Van Gogh
,,,,,been coming here since I was a child...
,,,,,when the lions scared me and are now old friends.
,,,,,"Called the best art museum in the world, I agree.  It's a magical place.  Home to some of the most iconic works of art known to human kind, including George Seurat's  Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, American Gothic, Hokusai wave, multiple Chagall masterworks including the series of stained glass windows specifically commissioned for the AIoC."
,,,,,"Plan your day around coming here and do the museum in a smart way.  They don't allow outside food or drinks if not sealed, but sealed is ok.  $1 bag check means you can bring them and check your sealed snacks and drinks.  No backpacks allowed period (you can accidentally hit an object with them."
,,,,,Special exhibits are always worth it.  HUGE kids area for arts and crafts to make it more experiential for them.  Public transport goes right there so leave your car at home.  Or walk... the Bean is right there too.
,,,,,"What makes this museum so phenomenal is the intelligently curated exhibits and user friendly, FREE audio commentary available on their app.  Get the story behind the work and why the artist made it.  Read into their techniques... phenomenal, mind blowing, stories that will stay with you."
,,,,,I spent hours here in bliss.  Smartest thing I did in Chicago.
,,,,,"My preference will always be historical artifacts, statues, and arts from different cultures, civilizations, and time periods. We spent 4 hours in here with so much to see, and not enough time to stroll through every exhibit."
,,,,,Favorites
,,,,,"- Anything with Asian, Indian, and Egyptian art and history"
,,,,,- Ivan Albright
,,,,,- Christian art
,,,,,- America Windows by Marc Chagall
,,,,,"Security - Friendly, helpful, and eager to assist you in finding your way and informing you about today's highlights."
,,,,,"One of the best art museums in the world, honestly probably better than my visits to the National Gallery in London, MoMA and the Broad in LA. "
,,,,,"Before visiting, I had no idea the art selection was so extensive. They have so many impressionist pieces (which are my favorite)!"
,,,,,"There's also a great selection of religious art, contemporary art, American art, and there's even an architecture exhibit. It's a really nice place to spend a day!"
,,,,,"I was really impressed with the Art Institute of Chicago! I'm no art expert, but I do enjoy looking at a variety of art, and the Institute has an extensive collection - 3 floors and 2 connected buildings of everything from modern and contemporary art to architecture to Impressionism to photography to Asian art, etc."
,,,,,"We spent ~3 hours in here and ended up skipping a few sections of the museum as we realized we were running out of time. I did get to see all of the exhibits that I was most interested in, but for a really thorough exploration of the museum, you could stay here for the entire day! So much to see."
,,,,,"There were actually quite a few famous pieces that I recognized - Nighthawks (nighttime view of a diner with a few people inside), American Gothic (woman and farmer guy holding a pitchfork), lots of water lilies by Monet, Van Gogh's self-portrait, Georgia O'Keeffe's cow skulls and clouds, and more."
,,,,,Also really loved the intricate detail in the Thorne miniature rooms in the lower level!
,,,,,"For lunch, they do have two cafes and a restaurant within the museum; but you can also exit the museum, eat nearby, and then re-enter with your ticket on the same day. No open drinks allowed inside (I chugged my coffee right outside the entrance), but water bottles are fine."
,,,,,Worth a visit? Definitely! This place is a treasure.
,,,,,"The hype is warranted... starts off kind of underwhelming, but there's so much amazing art here and it's so much bigger than it looks"
,,,,,Can I go back? I want to go back. 
,,,,,I spent hours in this museum and I still don't think I saw all the nooks and crannies that I needed to see. 
,,,,,"Conveniently located at the end of Millenium Park, I wandered into the Art Institute of Chicago and used my Chicago CityPass for expedited entry. Love it. Though there were various school / class groups in the museum on the morning I visited (Thursday, May 3rd... I think?), the museum is large enough that it wasn't a huge disturbance (unless they were yelling or running around one of the halls - but that was minimal). "
,,,,,"The museum is well organized and the collections of art and sculpture work are just beautiful. I can understand why the museum is so highly rated. Even the outside of the building feels like a masterpiece, with the North and South Lions seemingly guarding the building. "
,,,,,"There are, of course, the pieces from Picasso, Matisse, Dix, Van Gogh, Renoir, and Monet... but it's so easy to become absorbed in the works that are also somewhat less recognizable. I would be lying though too if I didn't admit to making a point to find ""A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"" by Seurat to stand and stare for a bit, Cameron Frye-style, at the beauty of such pointillist technique."
,,,,,"TL;DR  What can I say that hasn't already been said? An incredible collection of art that helps rank the Art Institute of Chicago up there as a ""must see""... just make sure you give yourself plenty of time to really wallow in the experience. This visit should not be rushed."
,,,,,I'm not a museum or artsy person but I really enjoyed walking around here.  Open and easy to navigate. They have a Manet exhibit going on right now but I did not have time for it.  I've discovered I like Renoir. When I was a kid we used to play the game Masterpiece and I knew many of the works of art here because of that game.
,,,,,One of the best place in the city! Happy we are lucky to have this museum.
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"Time to spare before the airport but not enough time to see this magical place. The paintings , art are incredible. A must see. Paid $25 dollars for entrance fee plus additional $7 to see Special exhibition of John Singer Sargent. Was able to see Monet, Manet and van Gogh, Seurat and my favorite.......Jean Leon Gerome for the Portrait of a Woman. "
,,,,,"If you have time, definitely stop by this museum!! Trust!"
,,,,,Wow. I'm not big into museums and I'm not big into art but this was a very enjoyable experience. Seeing familiar art throughout made this an incredible visit. 
,,,,,"The museum is organized and well with many employees throughout. It has a great layout and there's enough space to enjoy and not feel too crowded other than the really popular pieces. If you go early on a weekday when they open, I think you could easily enjoy a couple of hours with little traffic. "
,,,,,"If you're in Chicago and just have one day to be a tourist, the Art Institute should be at the top of your list. Well worth the price of admission I would not hesitate to return. Also included in the City Pass we purchased."
,,,,,"Pro Tip: Buy your tickets online or on your phone before arriving. When we arrived, there was a line to buy tickets, but no line if you already had tickets. Just stroll right in to the ticket scanning booth. I brought our tickets on my phone the night before and mobile tickets were super easy to access and use. Just click the ticket and let them scan it."
,,,,,"The Art Institute hosts some of the most famous paintings in the world - Georges Seurat's A Sunday on La Grande Jatte (my personal favorite), Pablo Picasso's The Old Guitarist, and Grant Wood's American Gothic."
,,,,,"We were lucky enough to catch the special exhibit, Manet and Modern Beauty. The exhibit was showcasing Manet's later works and runs through September 8th."
,,,,,Pro Tip #2: Download the Art Institute app on your phone and listen to the commentaries as you approach exhibits. The exhibits with commentaries are marked with a headphone symbol. The app really helped bring context to the Manet exhibit.
,,,,,"We spent about 3 hours in the Art Institute and didn't even scratch the surface of everything that they offer. Even if you're not a huge art fan, there is TONS to see at the Art Institute."
,,,,,"There is so much to explore here! And they have lots of exhibits ranging from impressionism to more modern stuff all over the world. They have sculptures, rocks, homeware, and even armor. It was really cool getting to see chainmail. But I don't advise you to wear heels if you plan on looking at every exhibit/room. I spent 5-6 hours here and I don't think I went to every room. There was a long line to pay for the tickets, but I think it may have been due to the popularity of Andy Warhol. They also participate in Bank of America's Museums on Us program. I'm not surprised they were on Trip Advisor's Best Museums list."
,,,,,"I absolutely loved this museum! Wish I had more time here so I could more carefully look at everything, we only had 2 hours to quickly walk through the majority of the exhibits. The collections and area is expansive to the point that you can get lost in there without a map. Especially enjoyed the medieval armor and impressionist galleries. Staff are helpful, bathrooms are plentiful and clean. This place puts every other art museum I've been to so far to shame!"
,,,,,During busy season there are long lines at the entrance. Chicago Go pass and special passes have separate line to get in and bypass the regular line.
,,,,,obviously the art is good. the food is expensive and not lots of places to sit. you could spend all day if you wanted but you'd be tired.
,,,,,A beautiful museum! From the art work
,,,,,"It houses, to the architecture of the building, the art institute is amazing. Each room is carefully thought out from the colors painted on the walls, to the layout and design of the exhibit. "
,,,,,The staff is very very kind and their service is beyond what I've ever seen in ANY museum! They are so helpful and kind begins words!  
,,,,,439 N Wells St
,,,,,I would highly recommend seeing the art institute! Pro tip: splurge and get the head set! It really elevated my experience of the art itself.
,,,,,"A must-visit site for any art-enthusiast visiting Chicago. They have one of the best collections of paintings I've seen and personally enjoyed seeing all of the Monet pieces in particular. I also didn't know they had the ""Sunday afternoon on la Grande Jatte"" painting here so imagine my surprise when I randomly stumbled across it here. There were many other iconic pieces and exhibits here and one can easily spend a few hours walking around trying to see it all. Definitely worth a visit and bring comfy walking shoes!"
,,,,,I wish I would've had more time to spend here!  There's just an enormous amount of art and artifacts to take in; you could easily take a full day to see everything.
,,,,,"The on-site staff were friendly and informative, but some of the security personnel were a bit stand-offish and disinterested."
,,,,,"This was a first visit for us, and the place didn't disappoint.  We didn't have a ton of time, so we kept to the more well-known exhibits:  Renoir, Chagall, Warhol, Grant Wood and of course, Seurat.  Seeing some of these up close was somewhat of a surreal experience.  Experiencing the ""pointillism"" in Seurat's ""A Sunday on La Grande Jatte"" was worth the trip in itself."
,,,,,We'll be returning when we visit Chicago again next year.  Had an amazing time
,,,,,"This is my favorite art museum in the US.. best I've ever been to in recent years. I budgeted 2.5 hrs to be spent and it was most definitely not enough. Toward the end of my budgeted time, I was speeding through the sections hoping to squeeze in as many pieces as possible before I had to leave... I don't think I've ever done that at a museum before. I am a big Impressionist fan and was blown away by how incredible the section dedicated to it was here. And I couldn't believe how beautiful this space overall! 1st floor galleries, 3rd floor modern art section, Chicago skyline you can see through the glass windows... even the museum store is fantastic. The only thing I didn't like was how I had to cross the gallery cafe to get to another side of the building, but it is not a big deal."
,,,,,"Take advantage of free admission with BoA credit card every first weekend of the month, but it's most definitely worth paying full price for at any time. If I ever live in Chicago in the future I plan on becoming a member."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,"High expectations for this place...while pizza sauce had good flavor, the crust was flat for a deep dish and as hard as a stale cracker on the edge crust."
,,,,,"Seating was jammed in, couldn't get up without bumping into a table next to us. "
,,,,,Wait time - 45 mins (expected)
,,,,,Service - good and very happy staff
,,,,,Food - maybe not the best night for this place
,,,,,Clearly a chain restaurant feel to this place

,,,,,Lou Malnati's Pizzeria
,,,,,"Delicious hand-made pizza! Deep dish pizza shipped from Chicago to Florida. First time ordering pizza to be shipped from another state, but it was worth it. I was so worried about the packaging and quality. The items came well packed in a foam cooler with dry ice. The package arrived around 3pm via UPS and I got home about 4 hours later and the items were still frozen. I am very happy with the quality and taste. I really like the taste of the vine ripped tomatoes, cheese, toppings, and yummy crust. The pizza came with clear cooking instructions and it cooked perfectly. Also, their customer service line was very friendly and professional. They are a little bit expensive, but worth it. I will definitely order again."
,,,,,Great deep dish pizza!
,,,,,We got the small and it was more than enough! Very filling! I would suggest ordering a small and other sides.
,,,,,We got the buffalo wings and a small salad.
,,,,,It was the perfect combination.
,,,,,"We put our name on the list, preordered our pizza, and got a text about 45 mins later. It was enough time to go to a nearby bar to grab a drink, and when we got our text we came back and was seated right away."
,,,,,Would recommend and come back here.
,,,,,This place is a must if you're trying to get the deep dish experience. From the customer service to the food it is the best pizza place you're going to find in Chicago. The beer selection was also good.
,,,,,"I ordered the pepperoni deep dish pizza, bruschetta, and calamari.  The calamari was awesome - along with the marinara sauce!  Although the bruschetta could have used a light sauce, it was tasty.  The pizza was not my favorite, I did not eat the leftovers.  The cheese on the pizza became hard and made it difficult to enjoy the pizza."
,,,,,"Although a great spot to try, its not a place I would visit again."
,,,,,"Maybe I am just not a deep dish gal. My friend and I ordered a small to share. It was just very sloppy, cheesy and not as hot as it should be for pizza. The mozzarella cheese got hard pretty quickly. We ended up not eating a lot of the crust. I still prefer thin crust. If deep dish, then Zachary still does it well."
,,,,,"This place IS Chicago deep dish. Get the Malnati special with the sausage ring and lou's salad with a goose island beer. It is the full experience. I have always enjoyed the atmosphere of a busy pizzeria and the wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable and happy to have you there.  Just remember: The pizza is filling but addictive. Pace yourself."
,,,,,"Called in our pizza at 10:00 and told them we would be arriving at 10:30 to grab a table! Got their at 10:30 was seated right away, ordered the bruschetta while we waited for our pizza to cook, the bruschetta was AMAZING! The ingredients were fresh, we devoured this. We ordered a medium half cheese half deep dish. Both sides were very good, I liked the cheese better though!"
,,,,,Of course you have to try the Chicago deep dish when you are in Chicago! 
,,,,,I ordered the famous Malnati Chicago classic deep dish and a side salad. 
,,,,,"YUM. The deep dish was delicious and flavorful! My first time trying deep dish and the crust along with the meat, sauce and cheese melted in my mouth. "
,,,,,The Lou malnati's salad dressing is BOMB Also!! Would definitely come again and recommend :)
,,,,,"Thank you for writing a review, Jenny! I am happy to hear you enjoyed our pizza. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,Great pizza great pricing cant wait for indoor dining is ok again so i can go back to enjoy the pizza and environment

,,,,,"Lovely spot. Sat at the bar and asked the bartender, Flint, for his recommendations and the service was GREAT. The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder was bomb AND the Smoked Pork Tongue was my favorite, so so flavorful! Perfect for sharing. The wine selection was also on point! Found my new favorite wine. Definitely recommend you check this out."
,,,,,"Went here for my bday for the first time. Was a little hard to find and they do not offer valet parking so that definitely sucked. Other than that the experience was great. The food was delicious also. We had Bone marrow, the Duck, pork tongue and a few drinks! Everything was delicious and the service was good too. It was towards the end of the night and the servers were getting ready to leave so that took away from the overall experience but it was great."
,,,,,"Context: Thursday night (around 6 PM) after work solo sitting at the bar. It was pretty busy, but I was able to snag a seat right away. "
,,,,,"Food & Drink: After looking around the menu, talking to the friendly bartenders, and checking out yelp I decided to get the Brussels sprouts and the pork shoulder. It was such a pleasant surprise. The pork was so tender and the flavors were so delicious. I had a refreshing Paloma to compliment my meal. I definitely need to come back with friends so I can try a variety of dishes"
,,,,,Other: I ended up chatting with the guy next to me. The environment is friendly and draws in a big/interesting crowd! I'll definitely be going back here.
,,,,,"Generally disappointed in the experience. Contrary to other reviews we found the portion sizes to be ridiculously small for what was considered 'sharable'.  5 little pieces of octopus for a 24 dollar item was off-putting. Also we found the dishes including feta and goat cheese had the cheese fluffed with what I assumed was heavy cream.  While it seems an exotic way to present artisan cheese, the flavor was heavily diluted and screams of a restaurant trying--and in this case failing, to mask food cost reductions. "
,,,,,On the positive side the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was vibrant without being overly loud. The presentation of the food was also top notch. 
,,,,,"Still, in a city famous for food, Purple Pig will have to do more to win back local repeat customers if it wishes to be anything more than a novelty overpriced tourist trap."
,,,,,"Located on the Magnificent Mile, this place is always packed! They do not take reservations so be prepared to wait for a while. The best time to get the fastest table are before 6pm or after 9pm. For singles, best bet is to fight out and snatch that first open seat at the bar. "
,,,,,The setting is pretty dark inside and it gets pretty hot due to the amount of people. You'll get the occasional bump behind your chair from folks trying to wait inside to get a seat at the bar. Plenty of wine options and the drink menu is robust. Now onto the food...
,,,,,The food menu is loaded with food to fulfill your palate. I ordered the following:
,,,,,"1. Grilled broccoli - grilled with roasted garlic, drizzled with anchovy vinaigrette, topped with breadcrumbs. The vegetable is grilled to perfection with the broccoli crowns being soft and the stalks soft and crunchy. The vinaigrette may have been a bit too much and made the dish more salty. Maybe a little less and it would've been better. "
,,,,,"2. Crispy pig ears - don't let the name scare you. Crunchy pieces and the sunny side up egg, kale, and pickled peppers enhances the flavor and gives you different tastes as you eat your way through the plate. "
,,,,,"3. Roasted bone marrow - AMAZING!!! Fatty, buttery goodness! It's a must try!"
,,,,,Pair it with a Chianti Classico to cleanse your palate and enjoy each bite as if it were your first time eating. 
,,,,,4. Sicilian Iris - this is their popular dessert. It takes a while to make and comes in hot so careful on the first bite. Its like a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate and topped with confectionary sugar. Pair it with a dry Madeira for your dessert drink. 
,,,,,"Overall, the food is great! You can't go wrong with their food. The drink and wine selections are huge and they can pair your food with the perfect drink. Service was great no matter how busy and packed it was. The only drawback is the wait time for a table and no reservations."
,,,,,I was so excited to try the Purple Pig and I had such a good time here. 
,,,,,"I sat at the bar and the servers were on top of everything. I had a meat and cheese board to start with duck prosciutto, chorizo and prosciutto and a Brie cheese. The duck and chorizo were delicious but I'd skip the regular prosciutto next time and try a different meat. The Brie was delicious and perfect for spreading and I really enjoy the fruit spread that came with it."
,,,,,"For the main course, I had the chicken thigh kebabs with tzatziki sauce and fried potatoes. It was amazingly good - definitely a big portion but it was so yummy that I finished it all."
,,,,,Would highly recommend coming here if you get the chance!
,,,,,"Tapas like menu, extensive drink and wine list.  Make sure you order to share.  Location is super solid as it is a few steps from Michigan Av and the River.  They don't take reservations so go at off peak times.  We got there on Sunday (summer) at 4 and they gave us table in 15 minutes.  Best of food was: pork belly w Sirloin, fried broccoli and beats.  Bear in mind I am a meat eater, so including 2 mostly vegetable suggestions means they really do a good job on both.  Their pig shoulder and roasted octopus were also tasty.  They had interesting non alcoholic drinks for minors (orange is the new).  Service was very attentive to details and our waiter was very adept in suggestions that were spot on.  Will give 5 stars if they enable Yelp's add me to the line or take reservations."
,,,,,"We were in town for the weekend but could not make it to dinner due to the 2+ hours wait time. However, we tried it again for lunch and agreed with the highly recommended yelpers.  This is probably the best meal we had in Chicago."
,,,,,"We were in town for the weekend but could not make it to dinner due to the 2+ hours wait time. However, we tried it again for lunch and agreed with the highly recommended yelpers.  This is probably the best meal we had in Chicago."
,,,,,"Walked in and the place was packed, expected a long wait, but the hostess said about 15 minutes. I also expected that to be false, but they called me right around 15 minutes! Our waitress came to our table and introduced the menu to us, telling us about their popular items. "
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow and the pig shoulder. The bone marrow was flavorful and had an interesting texture to it, a tad slimy. I read one of the reviews about the pig shoulder that said the meat melted in their mouth so I was super excited....to the point where I forgot to take a picture of it before eating it, but I'm sure someone else posted/will post a picture of it. While the meat didn't quite melt in my mouth it was absolutely delicious. I was already impressed with the bone marrow, but this pig shoulder. So. Freaking. Good. Paired extremely well with the mashed potatoes. Would go back solely for the pig shoulder."
,,,,,The Purple Pig does not disappoint. Great dishes to share with amazing service. 
,,,,,"This place gets pretty busy but fortunately got in without a wait time on a Friday around 5:20 PM, try to go before the dinner rush. "
,,,,,"Bone Roasted Marrow - Great, what a bone marrow should taste like with the perfect balance of parsley on top. "
,,,,,Deep Fried Devilled Eggs - Cant go wrong with a devilled egg with a nice twist if it being deep fried. The salad itself is bitter but with the deviled egg a good pairing. 
,,,,,"Octopus - MUST GET. The best octopus I've had in awhile. Very tender, with crispy tentacles, AMAZING with the chimichurri sauce. "
,,,,,"Steak - Also tender, tender enough to cut with a butter knife. The sauce is like a A1 sauce but fancier and the crispy topping makes a great addition. "
,,,,,Brocolli - Great pair with the Steak!

,,,,,How can you be visitor from Oklahoma where the cows grazing on the prairies are plentiful and eat the best burger in your life in the middle of the city? 
,,,,,"I don't know either, but it just happened.  Au Cheval has got the perfect combo to create a delicious burger with the best meat and amazing mouth watering bacon.  The ultimate burger includes an egg, but unfortunately I am not an egg eater. I am confident if you are an egg eater it's amazing, but yolk is just not my thing.  I went with the ""single"" cheeseburger which means 2 patties.  The burger comes with cheese, bacon, sauce that is scrumptious and a delightful pickle.  I left the onions on the side.  Everything about this burger was perfect. "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"We also had fries and hash browns. The hash browns were great.  The fries were so so good, but what made them unforgettable was the garlic aioli sauce.  Holy Moly Batman!  Loved that sauce and it kept me scarfing down more fries! "
,,,,,"It was a lunch that will be hard to beat.  Delicious! Superb! Perfection in every bite!  I need to mention the vibe in Au Cheval is warm, cozy, local, and the tune selection is on point playing on a reel to reel sound machine."
,,,,,"Wow, wow, and wow...!"
,,,,,"I'm not usually one to order a burger at a restaurant ever. My usual fix is In-N-Out or even McDonald's because I think...how much better can a burger ever be, it's just a burger."
,,,,,BUT THIS IS WILDLY DIFFERENT!
,,,,,THE BEST BURGER I'VE EATEN IN MY LIFE!
,,,,,It is wildly simple as well. You have the option for:
,,,,,-Single
,,,,,-Double
,,,,,-Add an egg
,,,,,-Add bacon
,,,,,I went for the Single with the Egg and Bacon.
,,,,,The beef patty is just astonishing. I've heard they cook it with duck fat or something and it shows. That meat is intensely flavorful and heavenly.
,,,,,The bacon is not some simple bacon that you'd see in any other burger. This is more like a slab of delicious sweet and salty pork belly perfectly cooked and glazed over to provide that additional layer of flavor.
,,,,,The egg with the runny yolk molds together with the flavors as well.
,,,,,"The only thing I would even ding this burger for if I had to nit-pick is that there aren't other textures in the burger, but not that it is really needed."
,,,,,There is a wedge of pickle on the side to help cut through the richness of everything.
,,,,,"Be aware, and I'm sure you already are, but the wait time during prime hours or the weekends is insane. We waited 3 hours for this heaven sent burger. BUT! Waiting is not actually standing in line waiting, or that would've made this experience not as grand. You put down your name and number and you'll get a text when your table is ready and you can also check your position in line whenever. We went to Ballast Point brewery a couple blocks away to chill and hangout and wait."
,,,,,"There are a lot of recommendations and must-tries when you ask people for Chicago eating, and this has GOT to be on your list."
,,,,,"Being the best burgers in Illinois, pretty good."
,,,,,"Long wait time upon arrival, but to be expected. We put our name and phone number on the list and walked around the hood to work up an appetite anticipating a hearty brunch."
,,,,,"We ordered the fried chicken and a burger with egg and bacon to share between the two of us. The amount of food is too much, we ended up taking some chickens home, yay for delicious left overs!"
,,,,,"Burger was good, I felt that the bacon's flavor overpowered it a little. Plus, that slab of thick pork slice isn't bacon lol."
,,,,,"I like the fried chickens more than the burger. It's seasoned just right, with a hint of ginger and really crispy and sweet coating. Delicious!"
,,,,,"Our server was super attentive. The restaurant layout was... very cramped. The servers had to stand in the bar seating area waiting for their order to come out, which is just on the other side of the bar."
,,,,,"I felt like food in Chicago seems a bit heavy handed on the salt, was it my imagination?"
,,,,,"Absolutely ridiculous! There is no way to call ahead to asK about wait times. I don't mind the fact that they don't take reservations,  but forcing people to drive out only to tell them it's a 4.5 hour wait is incredibly inconsiderate. I tried calling before hand to ask, all they offer is a voicemail service. When I said this to the Host, his response was ""it is what it is"". "
,,,,,Don't waste your time.
,,,,,came here around 2pm on a monday and it was still crowded and busy! thankfully got seated right away at the bar.
,,,,,"my friend and i both got the single cheeseburger with egg and my friend also got bacon added on. it was super meaty and delicious! i do think it lacked a bit of sauce tho, i added more ketchup to make it more juicy. "
,,,,,we also got side of fries which was yummy
,,,,,"overall i thought the food was good and heavy and filling, but it wasn't out of this world tbh. kind of overhyped."
,,,,,the service was nice tho! quick and attentive to our needs. the atmosphere is also very vibey and nice pub aesthetic.
,,,,,i think it was def worth a try but idt it's the best burger place in chicago like it's known for haha
,,,,,"Au Cheval makes a really incredible burger, and the pickle, cheese, sauce combo they have there is really unique. I think the verdict is still out if it's the BEST burger I've ever eaten which is the argument I hear more. "
,,,,,"This restaurant is small and crowded!! We went on a holiday knowing we would wait for a while, and four hours and a nap later we were seated. Restaurant is dark but plays great music. "
,,,,,"They have a great selection of beers on tap, and the fries were also delicious! The price point is also really comfortable for the hype of the burger. "
,,,,,"Overall we had a great experience, just don't know that this was hands down the best burger ever."
,,,,,"Au Cheval is an amazing and unique Chicago experience. I've gone here a number of times, both pre and during Covid and have consistently had good food and conversation with friends. The service is high quality and the music is not overpowering, if you're coming to catch up with friends you'll be able to hold a conversation without screaming over the speakers. Be forewarned this place is not very large and pre-Covid it got packed as people waited around. Try to get a reservation well in advance or plan on waiting for 1-1.5 hours - make sure you check in with the host. Here's a couple nuggets of knowledge to maximize your experience here:"
,,,,,Things to know:
,,,,,"-Get a burger, some of the starters are compelling like the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy (it's amazing) but the showstopper is the burger"
,,,,,"-A single is two patties and a double is four, they are not small patties and when I've come less than incredibly hungry the double can be tough to finish"
,,,,,-Make sure you indicate exactly what you want on your burger - I think it comes with special sauce and pickles by default but if you want lettuce and tomato make sure you ask
,,,,,-The egg - DO IT - add a fried one to your burger - takes it over the top into the heavens
,,,,,"-The crispy fries with egg are amazing and a great thing to split with a friend, would not recommend getting if you're solo and getting a double as that's a ton of food, opt for a side of fries"
,,,,,-The bacon is not bacon - it's PORK BELLY AND IT IS FANTASTIC - note I would NOT get this on a burger as it in my opinion overwhelms the burger - ask for it as a side with your crispy egg fries!
,,,,,"-As far as salads go, the kale caesar is great and a good way to kick off a meal with a bigger party"
,,,,,-Sweets - the mille-feuille is a winner but if they run out the gelato chocolate sunday is strong contender
,,,,,Feedback for Au Cheval:
,,,,,"-Your food is incredible, don't change it"
,,,,,-Please add milkshakes - my burger just needed one as I was eating it!
,,,,,The day has come... I am TAKING away two stars au cheval. And I tremble as I write this review. 
,,,,,Waited for ever last night. Not a problem. BUT two women that came in after my friend and I and harassed the front staff until they were seated. Ummm WOAH!!!! Didn't get the memo I need to harass people to be seated faster. And believe me I have it in me.  
,,,,,Whatever. 2 hours later got seated (just to complain some more the women that came in after me got a quote of 2 hours and were seated 30 minutes later buzz kill). The second we sat I was ready to order. The waitress came by and asked to give her a few minutes and I said great I'll be ready to order when ever she freed up. She made a snarky comment about my friend not being there and I said she just want to the restroom but I'm still ready to order. She was super not friendly and completely absent the whole night. As I was placing my order I noticed that the matzo ball soup and mashed potatoes were not on the menu. I needed a minute and literally shed a tear. BRING THEM BACK! 
,,,,,"Anyways fast forward. We ordered single cheeseburger, general janes,  fries with egg and a beer. 5 minutes later the burger came, then some time after the chicken a few minutes after that the fries. Beer??? WHERE WERE YOU BEER?? Odd order that's never happened. "
,,,,,Burger was good. Bun was cold. 
,,,,,General Janes fried chicken- ummmm it was so spicy that it was not that pleasant to eat. 
,,,,,Fries- a bit salty 
,,,,,The waitress came as we were picking the last of the fries and said oo they were changing the keg on the beer and it would be it shortly. HELLO!!! That probably should have been disclosed when we ordered it not after we finished our food. 
,,,,,I am so sad to give you guys 3 stars. :(
,,,,,I cannot believe I have never written a review for Au Cheval! Holy moly this is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago!
,,,,,I love everything about this place except the wait time ( :-/) 
,,,,,Food Recommendations:
,,,,,General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken- Perfect friend chicken with a sweet and spicy glaze 
,,,,,Matzah Ball Soup- Who doesn't love a Matzah Ball with a side of liquid. 
,,,,,Foie Gras Terrine-  The only place where I eat foie gras. I slather my texas toast with raspberry jam and top it off with the perfectly silky foie gras
,,,,,Cheeseburger- Single or double ( I've had both) and you have to get it with egg and bacon. No other way to eat it and dont even waste your time
,,,,,"Crispy Fries with egg, cheese sauce and garlic mayo- A must to pair with your cheeseburger"
,,,,,(side note: I've had the crispy potatoes with duck heart gravy- it was good but I had trouble wrapping my brain around duck hearts and it was a struggle to eat more than 2 bites)
,,,,,Drink Reccomendations: 
,,,,,I love their whiskey sour (it's perfect) and the Hemingway Daiquiri ( my go- to drinks)
,,,,,"if you are willing to wait 1 1/2- 2 hours you must order everything, it's worth it ( and tastes great re-heated the next day). "
,,,,,I keep meaning to order the fried bologna sandwich and come late enough to order the midnight chilaquiles  ( on my to-do list)
,,,,,Service 5/5
,,,,,"I recently came in on 3/19, got super lucky and scored a bar spot. The host man was super friendly, our waitress was wonderful, my roommate and I sat in front of the bartender and she was super pleasant ( even gave us a quick lesson in beer followed by a few samples). and as we sat there in a coma (brought on by amazing food) the manager ( I assume the manager) came by chit-chatted with us and told us about the desserts ( we passed) he was super friendly. A ton of restaurants can take a lesson from Au Chevals amazing service. "
,,,,,"Overall 5/5 ( food, drink and service). Worth the wait and all the hype about this place is true. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!"
,,,,,"Rated the #1 best burger in America! Do I agree??? Noooo!! LOL Yesssss! This place rocks! Make sure you are strategic when you go because the wait time can be over and hour, I went at 2pm on weekday and got in, in less than 15 minutes. You have to have the burger with egg. They have the burger building down to a craft. The burger was juicy, velvety with the added egg and the fries were the perfect compliment. It's a small place and the bar is even more cramped but you get front row seats to the SHOW! Is it worth the wait.."

,,,,,Why is the line so long?  Why is the food so good ....is it because I waited 2 hours for it?  I don't know but the food was amazing!  
,,,,,I wish they had a way they could tell me the best time to come during the week for lunch and not go pass my lunch hour.  No matter when you go you will have a great time and the food and drinks are really good. 
,,,,,Who does burgers like this place ...NO BODY!  Please note that the bacon on the burger is well worth the wait!! 
,,,,,I hope this review helps!

,,,,,"Wow. Just.... heart-stopping, artery clogging goodness. So we busted a mission to get here with a crazy mess of reservations and finessing, but we were able to wait at the actual restaurant for only about 30 minutes until we got seated. We all really wanted to try Au Cheval, and I don't regret all the stress we had to go thru to be able to eat here."
,,,,,"We shared the bone marrow, the General Jane chicken wings, and had to try the famous burger with BACON and an egg. "
,,,,,"I had bone marrow before, and while I did think that was delicious, the one from Au Cheval blew me away. My mouth is watering just thinking of it omfgggg. It came with this balsamic meat jam on the side and some bread, and HOT DAMN was it superb. It was literally savory meat butter and I wish I had like 10 more of those. Jesus. Don't do what I did and try to get any last remnants of marrow by pouring whatever's left in the bone down your gullet. It's just oil and you're probably going to regret it LOOOOOOOL "
,,,,,"Okay, now for the burger. It's definitely on the heavy side, and you're probably gonna need some napkins. The bacon is the most essential part of the burger. It's sweet, smoky, and peppery and is SO DAMN GOOD. I could have gone without the egg so the cheese would have more impact, to be honest. This is definitely a sharable dish! "
,,,,,"I also got to try the General Jane chicken wings, and the sauce that they were tossed in was spicy and sweet, and the chicken was juicy! This was definitely a great add on to the meal, but I could see myself getting a different side next time. "
,,,,,"I also got to try some of my friend's garlic fries and they were so good with the creamy aioli on the side. If we had more room, I would have been down to order some of those too. Shidddddd."
,,,,,"So yeah play your cards right with the timing and come at the right time for a reservation and you'll have an amazing, carnivorous dining experience here at Au Cheval! If I'm ever back in Chicago, I'll definitely try and check this place out again and try those foie gras scrambled eggs. Highly recommend."
,,,,,Ah Cheval lived up to the hype.
,,,,,"We went on a early Tuesday evening before the wait was crazy long. We did have a shirt wait so ordered beer at the bar and drank them out front while we waited. Once inside, the waiter promptly got our drink order and made some recommendations on food orders."
,,,,,"All 3 in our party ordered the single cheeseburger, mine was with added fried egg ($1) and bacon ($5). The bacon was incredibly delicious. The entire burger was extremely well seasoned and mouthwatering. The fries were also perfect but they brought them out early, almost as an appetizer which was a bit strange."
,,,,,"Only giving 4/5 stars because although it was great, I would never wait more than 30 mins for a table to enjoy this burger."
,,,,,"Possibly my favorite place we ate at in Chicago. I'd been to 4 Charles at home in NYC a few times, which serves the same burger, and they actually just opened an Au Cheval, but we wanted to visit the OG first. Double cheeseburger with egg and bacon, French fries and Mille-feuille were all perfection. Only thing I'd skip next time is the fried chicken, but it was great. Wait was about 20 mins for lunch on a weekday. 1000000 out of 5 stars."
,,,,,Among the Best Burgers of my life!!
,,,,,My second time here and definitely worth the 1hr wait on a tuesday!
,,,,,"SINGLE BURGER -ADD EGG & BACON : Single is 2 patties (double is 3 patties, confusing I know!). The single with Egg and bacon is the perfect combination! "
,,,,,"BONE MARROW WITH BEEF CHEEK MARMALADE: 4 seasoned bones with buttery marrow, comes with 4 buttery delicious half toasts and the delicious beef cheek marmalade is perfection!"
,,,,,"CHICKEN AND WINGS: Does not dissapoint! Asian style wings. Crispy, well seasoned, delicious."
,,,,,I will continue to come here every visit to Chicago and wait as long as I need to for this amazing burger.
,,,,,"Au cheval definitely lived up to its hype!! We luckily figured out that Au Cheval was really close to the bar we were at (Federales), so my friend and I quickly ran over put our names down and it ended up being a 2 hour wait! Which wasn't bad because we were going to spend that much time at the bar anyway! "
,,,,,"When entering... I always imagined a huge place, but really it's a small little area with booths and then some bar seating! It was a quaint little thing, I loved the old timey vibes! "
,,,,,SERVICE: Our waiter was prompt and sweet! Suggested a fee things for us! 
,,,,,"FOOD: Now this is what I call a solid burger! I don't know how they do it, but it definitely lived up to its title as ""Best Burger in America"". Everything was perfect cooked "
,,,,,We also got the Honey chicken and it was perfectly flavored and crispy!
,,,,,"A lot of Yelpers rave about Au Cheval's 'best burger everrr', but take 2-3 stars off for 'the long wait' - that makes NO sense. Don't come here if your entitled self cannot wait 2 hours on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday in a city of 3 million people.  "
,,,,,"With that being said, please come here if you're a genuine lover of food and want to taste the amazing flavors of the best burger in the city. The hype and wait times are worth it, and it's not like there's nothing else to do to pass the time in the most thriving neighborhood/ food and drink scene in the city. "
,,,,,"Just recently, I came on a Friday afternoon at 4 and was seated right away, so if you can be flexible with your schedule, you'll have better odds. I of course had the burger. The single was plenty for 1, even 2 people to share. Add both the fried egg, and thick cut bacon for a truly enjoyable explosion of flavors-in-your-mouth burger. Yes, it's greasy and rich. But it's not impossible to eat! It's cooked to perfection, the bun is buttery, and all the flavors go really well together to make for the perfect burger. Add a side of fries while you're at it. "
,,,,,"Another option to consider is the bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade app. If you aren't weirded out by the huge femur bones you're served with marrow inside, then you'll enjoy. Its very rich with smooth, delicious flavors of the marrow, thick, fluffy toast, and marmalade spread. Share with a couple of friends, but ask for more toast. It only comes with four pieces, but you get several large bones. "
,,,,,"I highly recommend visiting, unless you cannot get past the long wait. A true foodie is here for the right reasons: food. Keep that in mind when reading other unfairly critical reviews talking about everything BUT their meal."
,,,,,Surprisingly ordinary food. Still confused by what the hype is all about.
,,,,,"We ordered their famed burger and fries and found them shockingly average for a gourmet burger place. And would recommend shake shack or even five guys over here due to the availability of seating. Since I couldn't find fault in the food besides the fact that it doesn't justify the hype, so I gave the restaurant a 3 star."
,,,,,"My dining companion and I got all ambitious and decided to split a single cheeseburger with egg accompanied by a ""small"" order of chilaquiles. ""Shit!"", we both exclaimed as we tried to shovel the mountainous plates of rich indulgence into our strained pie holes. I alternated between burying my face into the meaty burger, letting the beef juices run down my chin and forearms, and enjoying loud, crunchy mastication that the chilaquiles provided. I found the burger to be a bit too salty, but tasty nonetheless. "
,,,,,"Although the restaurant was packed, service was friendly and prompt. I typically don't eat rich, meaty, greasy food often, so you bet my body made me pay for this decadent meal the next day."
,,,,,THERES A RESON THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN THE COUNTRY! (And if that stat is wrong we'll then it should be and the real stat is the wrong one) 
,,,,,Don't be a fool. Get the egg and bacon on it. TRUST ME. 
,,,,,Also- the single is more like a double and the double is like a triple patty burger. And the fries are also amazing but the sauce it comes with on the side steals that show. 
,,,,,Tip; go in and put your name down. They text you when your table is ready so you can head next door to some bars and drink while you wait!
,,,,,"Ugh, my mouth is watering. I NEED IT."
,,,,,"I've been looking forward to eating at Au Cheval following the recommendation of family, friends, and food networks - B E S T burger in the US?! We gotta judge for ourselves. When we went, the wait was only 25-30 minutes, which is super short because, apparently, the wait can be up to 4 hours?! I can actually see this happening given the food and the small dining space they have. I can only imagine what this place is like on the weekends or even All Star Weekend. I went to go place our names on the list, but the hostess was very rude - she interrupted me as I was checking in and basically dismissed me, stating that she had a lot of people who wanted to talk to her. After I asked everyone in the waiting area if they checked in, we attempted to check in again and she took our names the second time. WTF? Well, I'll just attribute that to her being overwhelmed and incapacity to multitask. Good thing is, that was the worst of our experience there."
,,,,,"We were seated at the bar right where the action happens. Every plate that they put together was mouth-watering. I ordered a Bloody Mary with a whole slew of pickle garnishments along with the bone marrow with beef cheek marmalade and two single burgers with an over easy egg and bacon. Everything about our meal was delicious - almost sinful. The bone marrow is plentiful with two transverse cut bones and paired with the marmalade is out of this world. You could eat the marmalade on its own. The burger had such quality ingredients that you don't get a heavy feeling at the end of it. Ugh, arguably one of the best burgers I've had. This place, though, can easily run you up to $100."
,,,,,"Otherwise, I was impressed with the efficiency of the cooks and servers, which were topped off by an awesome and fun attitude (very much unlike the hostess)."

,,,,,"I was at th this pancake place for the first time and the coffee is delicious I got to taste the raspberry and I had the cinnamon. I had the chilaquiles breakfast and I was very impressed with the taste, and chrunchy tortilla chips.  I will definitely go back soon. The waitress was very welcoming."
,,,,,"We had two very enjoyable experience is here. The staff was amazing, the food was amazing, the speed that the food came out was amazing. I would highly recommend this however due to the amount of people I would recommend getting there prior to 8:30 in the morning."
,,,,,The food was good.  Service was off. Maybe it's because we had a child with us. Maybe because we weren't the right type of patron. Not sure if I'd come back.  The comments from the server were inappropriate when we left the restaurant.
,,,,,"I give this place three stars because the food is good and the staff is friendly, they have an outdoor area without heaters so our food got cold within 5 minutes and we were freezing the whole time we were there the waitress was very friendly and refilled our coffee cup about 5 times since it kept getting cold, should they add some heaters this place will be 5 stars worthy."
,,,,,"This is my go to spot for breakfast every time I'm in Chi-town! Amazing food, amazing service, and amazing staff."
,,,,,My must go-to breakfast spot when in Chicago! Always packed and always great food and service.
,,,,,"Our order is always cooked to perfection. Whether we do take out, dine in, or delivery i can always count on how consistent the quality of their food is."
,,,,,Great place for breakfast
,,,,," We ate outside, the weather was perfect. Got their early on a Saturday morning. By the time we left, it was packed with customers waiting to be seated. "
,,,,,"After eating here, we know why. The food is delicious. Our server Patrick was attentive, and made great suggestions for us to pick from. BTW, the coffee was very good, hubby is kind of a coffee snob, so for him to comment was a kudo. I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon, which was cooked perfectly, and opted for the berry bliss pancake. Don't miss out on that for sure. Perfect pancakes with lots of yumminess. See the pic. Hubby had the same side of bliss pancakes, and he loved them as well. For his entree he had the Rutherford omelet, really big and tasty."
,,,,,Don't miss this spot.
,,,,,My favorite breakfast place in Chicago! The food is amazing here! It's right across from millennium park. It has outdoor seating. Be aware that the wait is very long on the weekends. I recommend getting there early because you will most likely be waiting at least an hour. They don't have a breakfast bar which is a bummer but they do have outdoor seating. They do not take reservations. The pancakes are amazing!! A must try place in downtown.
,,,,,Good spot!! Definitely suggest it for some unique pancakes. We had the berry blast and the cinnamon bun pancakes both were very good. 
,,,,,Home fries were eh 
,,,,,Omelet was pretty good (I got the Rutherford) 
,,,,,Dippy eggs were solid
,,,,,Pancakes are the attraction here
,,,,,My wife and I came here during our trip to Chicago and this ended up being the best place we ate at in this foodie town. Loved this place. First of 2 times we came here I got the waffle and fried chicken. Now I'm not really into this dish too much but this has been the first time that I really liked this dish! which says something about this one. The second dish I had on my second trip was the Omelet and side pancake. Was great and loved both dishes. Were prepared just right and the service was friendly and prompt.

,,,,,Latte was good het my toast was an even toasted could bend.The eggs and sausage where good I enjoyed the hash browns.
,,,,,"Oh boy where do I start. First, come here when it's not peak hours and not on the weekends. The place gets busy and packed QUICK. Lines can be huge but it's worth the wait. "
,,,,,Wildberry is by far my favorite breakfast/brunch place of all times (for now). I'm from Texas and can genuinely say that nothing tops Wildberry. I haven't been to many other breakfast joints in Chicago but I was blown out of the park. Portion sizes are huge and everything tastes delicious. 
,,,,,The butcher block with veggies added into it was superb. I love my eggs sunny side up and it was done perfectly. The meats and the hash underneath the eggs are an explosion of flavors. Everything was cooked just right. 
,,,,,"The chocolate chip banana pancakes were so fluffy and the bananas were perfectly ripe. I just want to say I'm not a fan of sweet things, but I'd definitely snag these pancakes again."
,,,,,I didn't order anything else but I got to try my friends French toast and it's matches up with everything else. Also looking at other people's eggs Benedict made my mouth water. I wish I could go back to order it but I'll have to settle with the pictures.
,,,,,"The staff is super friendly and nice and things move by pretty quickly. If you're here, try and come on a weekday when it's not as busy. This is a must if you're visiting Chicago."
,,,,,Bottom Line:  Popular and delicious breakfast and lunch.  
,,,,,There was a line forming by about 8am on a Sunday morning so I think that says a lot!  (At home even the most popular breakfast places in the touristy part of town don't have a wait until about 9am.) My husband and I are early birds so we arrived about 7:30am and then the restaurant quickly filled up.
,,,,,Service was prompt and friendly and all of our food was tasty. The portions were large so neither of us were able to finish out breakfasts. 
,,,,,"My husband had the famous Wildberry Pancakes which were huge, beautiful and sweet.  They were drizzled with what I would describe as a strawberry cream cheese frosting.  The pancakes had blueberries cooked in them and were accompanied by a mound of beautiful, fresh berries."
,,,,,"I always crave a sweet breakfast but I feel like I need a savory and filling protein breakfast.  What I appreciate about Wildberry is that you can get a side of pancakes with your savory breakfast instead of toast! I loaded my omelette within ham and veggies and thoroughly enjoyed the taste and the protein kept me feeling full for hours.  The omelette cafe with fruit fruit, and drumroll, two buttermilk pancakes.  "
,,,,,Hooray for the flexibility to get a sweet and savory breakfast combo in a comfortable atmosphere!
,,,,,I can
,,,,,This place is located right across the Park in Chicago where the famous Bean is located. The wait for this place is extremely long! Do expect a long 1 to 2 hours to be seated. The waiter we had was extremely nice and helpful with recommendation or any question we may have. I have to say it did take him awhile to reach to us but the amount of table he had to take care was understandable. 
,,,,,The price point for each plate was understandable as each portion was big for just one tiny person like me to consume! 
,,,,,"I have to say, the food here was just okay. The food did not amazing me as I thought it would with all the reviews it obtained. I got the strawberry and chocolate waffle and that was hard to swallow. I did not know they would just put chocolate chip on top, which made it dry and overly sweet. Some of the plates that my friends had was average and not much flavor. "
,,,,,"Overall, I find this place average and similar to any typical brunch place. If you don't like long lines or crowds, I would recommend you to go to another one because your not missing out much. I have to say they get one two thumbs up for making their hash browns crispy !"
,,,,,"I miss this place. We decided to give yolk a break while on vacation in Chicago and wild berry did not disappoint. They had delicious pancakes, the eggs Benedict were literally perfection. My husband had an omelette which was delicious as well and the service was great and attentive. I cannot wait to go back to my favorite city to come here again."
,,,,,Fabulous Sunday breakfast spot.  Had to wait a little bit but it was worth it.  Pancakes are the best!
,,,,,"IF YOU HAVE NOT TRIED THEIR FOOD YET, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR? I came here for breakfast with a group of coworkers -we drove all the way from Schaumburg because the office boss would not shut up about this place- and we did not regret it. I may be new to the Yelp-app, but bet your sweet ass I leave real and honest reviews. Best breakfast in the area! *chef's kiss*"
,,,,,"Very popular breakfast spot - for locals, tourists, families, professionals - you name it, everyone is here!  For that reason, they are extremely strict about not seating until the entire party has arrived and not allowing folks to join the table later.  We mentioned we had a colleague running late and would like for him to sit with us, not even order any food that would cause us to hold the table longer, and they gave us a hard NOOO.  The hostess repeated it several times.  A bit obnoxious and not very hospitable - the only reason I'm dinging two stars on this review.  Otherwise, their menu is very extensive, portions are generous and most importantly, food is good.  Was full for hours."
,,,,,"My wife and I enjoyed our recent visit to Wildberry. This breakfast spot is hugely popular in downtown Chicago. Fortunately, I was able to join the waiting list using the Yelp app prior to arriving at the restaurant which had an hour-long wait at the time. Once we were seated I ordered the Wild Mushroom Omelette with a side of ""Signature Berry Bliss"" Pancakes. The portions were massive! The fluffy omelette was filled with meaty and salty prosciutto, tender mushrooms, and gooey provolone cheese. However, the side of hashbrowns was mushy and had little flavor. The pancakes were delicious: fluffy, sweet, and paired with juicy berries. Overall, it was a nice stop for breakfast."
,,,,,"Memorial Day morning and many options for breakfast are closed. Thankfully was able to make a reservation at this extremely popular restaurant (with an hour and a half wait time). Like clockwork, got a text after an hour and a half to see the host up front to be seated."
,,,,,"Many wonderful options from the menu, so we ordered a bunch without considering the portion sizes. Already had a coffee earlier, thus deciding on the Strawberry Mango Smoothie ($5) to go along with the Brisket Hash; adding the Strawberry Poppy Specialty Pancakes option ($15+2). Overall way too much food for one person. A heaping pile of hashbrowns topped by moist brisket and two poached eggs. This is accompanied by two thick buttermilk pancakes covered in buttercream powdered sugar, and strawberries. Loved the brisket - overpowered the oily hashbrowns and made even better by the runny eggs. Pancakes are super soft and had a delicious lemon tang to it. Smoothie is a refreshing counter to all the warm food, though wish I had ordered something lighter to drink."
,,,,,"Despite the large crowd, service is quick and helpful (they do want high turnover). Highly recommend to make a reservation."

,,,,,"At breakfast there this morning with a group of six. Mask needed when server approaches table. We ate eggs, waffles, omelettes, and pancakes. All was delish, server was so good too!"
,,,,,We were lucky enough to get a table outside due to rain. And i was so glad we were able to try here because i LOVED their pancakes. I am not a big fan of pancakes but their pancakes were very chewy and tasty. There wasnt anything that didnt blend in with each other and ordering this denver this with side of signature berry pancake was best to share among two people.
,,,,,It seems like you can also be waitlisted through yelp so make sure you use this feature instead of wasting your time waiting outside or waking up super early.
,,,,,This is my favorite breakfast place in Chicago. The menus is extensive and the service is prompt.
,,,,,Ordered door dash recently while on a trip to Chicago and the breakfast was amazing. I totally recommend this place.
,,,,,"With over 4,000 reviews and a high Yelp score - how can you not try this spot for brunch while in the area. It's only open until 2:30 pm so they only serve breakfast and lunch so I had high brunch hopes!"
,,,,,"We went on a weekday AM and were shocked that there was still a wait albeit brief.  Once seated, I was a bit overwhelmed with the HUGE brunch menu. Waitstaff was attentive and helped suggest some of the most popular items. I opted for the garden skillet ($13) which was sort of the insides of an omelette (veggies in this case) with hash browns mixed in topped w/cheddar cheese and then your choice of eggs (I did poached). It was sort of an inside out omelette which I liked. Sort of a new take on the standard and it was really good. I opted for the side of buttermilk pancakes (2) - really good pancakes. Flaky, delicate, buttery goodness. This was a TON of food and I barely made a dent. My husband got the veggie omelette with pancakes for $14 including cheese. HUGE omelette and also well cooked and darn good.  "
,,,,,Believe the reviews and give it a try - you won't be disappointed.
,,,,,"Tried the best brunch place in Chicago! We went at around 8am on a weekday to avoid the potential of any long line. Surprisingly, even on a weekday at 8am, this place is pretty busy (that's how popular it is)! We got seated right away though."
,,,,,Now onto the food:
,,,,,"I ordered the slow roast brisket hash, lemon buttercream toast, Wildberry pancake, and banana cream crepe! "
,,,,,The slow roast brisket hash was delicious! The meat was very tender! The hash brown itself was a bit too starchy for me; I think I would have preferred the cauliflower hash though since the regular hash made the dish too heavy.
,,,,,"I wasn't as much of a fan of the Wildberry pancake or the buttercream toast. The sauce used for the Wildberry was good, but I wish there was more of it on the pancake since without the sauce, the pancakes didn't have as much flavor. I personally enjoyed the crepe the most!"
,,,,,We checked in on a Sunday at around 10:15am and they told us it would be about a 2 hour wait.  We were fine with that because we were told about this place for breakfast and saw the reviews on yelp.
,,,,,We stood inside And waited about a hour and thirty minutes and the manager must have felt sorry for us and seated us. YAY!!! (So excited to o have breakfast)
,,,,,-clean restaurant and restrooms
,,,,,-family friendly (just be careful of large strollers)
,,,,,-good food and lattes 
,,,,,-great customer service 
,,,,,-good prices $$
,,,,,If we are back in Chicago we will definitely visit again.
,,,,,"I'm not a sweets for breakfast person, but oh man did I love this place. I opted for crepes over their famous pancakes to avoid the heaviness of pancakes and I was not disappointed. Wait was long, but we got in line on Yelp and just had about a half hour wait once we checked in. I feel like that was probably longer than usual because we came here at pique brunch time two Sundays before Christmas."
,,,,,"Anyway, about the crepes: awesome texture, and the filling was just flavorful enough without being overly sweet or rich. Fruit was really fresh, too!"
,,,,,"And service was great! Food comes out super quick and it felt like there were at least ten people attending to us. Great experience, will come back!"
,,,,,"We ate here on our last trip to Chicago and loved it, so we came back again. It is sooo good! The breakfast panini is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever eaten. I got it both times, and we ordered it for takeout the next day too! A little pricey, but absolutely delicious. The wait is long- we put our name in left and got mimosas down the street, which worked out perfect. My husband got the basic breakfast and he said everything just tastes better than other places. Love this place!"
,,,,,"This place makes AMAZING waffles! The berry bliss Belgian waffles are a must-try if you can't decide. I've had the same flavor in pancakes and waffles, and for me the waffles triumphed. "
,,,,,"Their sizzling skillets are great. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the butcher block. It's definitely big enough to share between two people, especially if you want only a taste of sausage, bacon, and other meats. "
,,,,,There's no wait if you come at 7 or 8 on a weekday. I know it gets really busy around noon.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was very busy. There were people waiting outside and inside. There is an upper level with seating but even then, it was still very busy. We were finally seated and were handed the menus. "
,,,,,"I ordered the los altos benedict which had chorizo sausages, red peppers, poached eggs, and hash browns. It was very savory with a hint of Mexican burrito taste. I loved it! It was also quite spicy, so if you can't handle spicy, I wouldn't recommend getting it. My bf got the Butcher block skillet which had hash browns, cheese, eggs, sausage, and bacon. He also got a side of the specialty berry bliss specialty pancakes. "
,,,,,"The food was so good, I was very pleased with the generous portions and the quality of the taste. Of course, we had leftovers since we ordered too much food. "
,,,,,We also got the Wildberry orange juice which was super tasty! It had a touch of berry and orange taste to it. The blend was very smooth and refreshing. 
,,,,,I just wished they had the AC on that day. It was very hot outside and humid and the inside was very stuffy! Everyone was eating with sweat dripping down. I would have liked to enjoyed my meal more.
,,,,,Stalked this place on IG only to come and I've already been. I had the churro french sticks  the berry french toast were good also. The hashbrowns were cooked to perfection. I like crispy on top and cooked but soft inside and these were perfect without any special instructions. And everything was really hot (temp wise) I love this place. Can't wait to try something new next time.
,,,,,"We had walked past this place a couple of times and there always seemed to be people waiting to get in, so we decided to see what the hype was all about... and we were not one bit disappointed. "
,,,,,"My husband ordered the berry bliss pancakes and I ordered the key lime pie pancakes. Both were piled 5 pancakes high with delicious fruit toppings and respective flavored creme packed in the middle. So stinkin' good, but neither of us could even come close to finishing our plates and easily could have split a single order between the two of us."
,,,,,"We also had our 2 year old with us and ordered her the ""one egg meal"" from the kid's menu-- which came with an entire bowl of sliced fruit, a generous portion of scrambled egg, and 2 pancakes. Needless to say, she also did not come close to finishing her food. But she gave this place two thumbs up as well, and the staff were super friendly and accommodating for her as well. "
,,,,,"The only downside is that this place is so popular, if you come much later than 730, expect a wait to get in... but the wait will be totally worth it."
,,,,,So first off. I would definitely call in or go on to Yelp to get on waitlist because YOU WILL be waiting for atleast 2-3 hours if anything. 
,,,,,There's a coffee stand on the side front that can still address customers if they wanted something to drink while they are waiting. 
,,,,,So I got the 'blueberry bliss' pancakes which were pretty soft and delicate but I just honestly felt like they were like any other pancake to be honest. I love the fresh fruit on the side and how they came in five pancakes which was a plus. 
,,,,,I also had the side of hasbrowns were pretty crispy and basic. I also had a the hazelnut coffee and they put way way too much milk in it because I can barely taste the hazelnut.
,,,,,"Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the hype over the pancakes, and the wait was just way too long for me to keep waiting for just that. If anything, I'll most like come back to try other things in the menu."
,,,,,There is a waitlist that starts as early as 9 AM but the front desk is so used to it as is evident in the smooth and professional way they deal with it. No sweat/ hazels. Just a heads up so that you can  make sure your kids aren't hangry already when you get there. 
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"We were a large group. Still got a table quickly, the waitstaff was super nice. "
,,,,,"Food: I had the signature berry bliss Belgian waffle .... yummmm, and my kid had the Oreo smore pancakes and finished the whole thing. The hubs and parents had omelette a which were just okay. So I'd say maybe they do sweet better than savory? Just a thought."
,,,,,Super yummy brunch place! Breakfast and lunch too I suppose LOL. Plenty of gluten-free options or at least they did last time I was there. I also remember the portions being absolutely huge
,,,,,Thank you Yelp! If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have found this place. Last week I scheduled a breakfast meeting here with one my manufacturers that I work with. They do not take reservations so a Monday morning 8 AM I figured it would be good. It was no wait which was great. 
,,,,,My colleagues got there before me and I was directed to where they were at a booth in the back. Service was top notch since time was of the essence I quickly ordered my favorites. Nice cup of hot earl grey tea with fresh lemon. Two eggs sunny side up with crispy bacon and rye toast. Also I had to try their specialty pancakes and had the wild berry. OMG were they fantastic! Additionally my breakfast came with either a side of fruit or hashbrowns. Well the fruit was a nice variety perfect in season melon and berries. 
,,,,,I will definitely be back soon hopefully tomorrow!
,,,,,The food was amazing and the service was really good. I gave a large tip because he was so genuine and sweet. My only issue is that they were crowded but I completely understand because the food is really good.
,,,,,Absolutely delicious! I worked at the AON center and used to hit this up regularly and now that I have recently moved I miss it.  Plan ahead as there is always a wait once things open back up.
,,,,,What a great to spend a leisurely weekend morning. I had the wildberry  Belgium waffle. Simply delicious. My husband had the southern Benedict with sausage gravy. His was perfect because the sausage was perfect with the sausage gravy. We had slow coffee and a great breakfast.
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Maybe it's because I got this place delivered but I honestly had a better experience at IHOP.
,,,,,I ordered an omelette with hash browns and the berry bliss pancakes. The omelette was decent but the hash browns were honestly the worst I had in my entire life. I get that they would be soggy from being in the container during delivery but potatoes were also under cooked and had absolutely no flavor. It was as if they decided not to put any salt on them and hoped I would smother it with the ketchup they provided. I ended up having to cook them in the oven in order to be able to eat them.
,,,,,As for the pancakes they most definitely were not worth the price. They were just normal pancakes with some fruit tossed on and sweet icing for a very expensive price. 
,,,,,It was nice being able to try out this restaurant without having to go through the normally long wait times and I really wanted to like it but unfortunately I do not see myself trying this place again.
,,,,,I was able to dine-in which was cool lots of social distancing going on. Anyways service was fast and very accurate. I just needed a quick bite before my long drive across two states. All together I was satisfied with the service and cleanliness.
,,,,,Amazing. We actually got lucky and only had to wait like 10 minutes. Will certainly be back here. 
,,,,,I got the chilaquiles and they were incredible. The only problem was that i couldn't eat all the food. I also got a side of bacon (average bacon) and the banana pancakes. My lanta they were splendid. 
,,,,,Seriously - the only issue is that I wasn't able to eat more. Will certainly come back and try other options. 
,,,,,"Fresh squeezed OJ was a plus, too."
,,,,,"Love the ability to jump on the waitlist straight from the Yelp app, definitely made the arrival experience easier!  "
,,,,,Our server was very friendly and helpful and the food was brought out in a decent time for how busy they were!
,,,,,Avocado toast (gf) was delicious! 
,,,,,I didn't get to the pancakes but I saw from afar and it smelled and looked delicious (huge portions!) 
,,,,,"Would visit again to try the pancakes and waffles, love the gluten free varieties, so nice to have options!"
,,,,,"Would recommend the Signature Berry Bliss crepe, it's not too sweet and well balanced with berries."
,,,,,"If you like pancakes , get the banana coconut cream pie.  The flavours of coconut is noticeable and complements the banana. "
,,,,,"Tip:  the serving size is huge, I would recommend get two entrees to share for three people."
,,,,,"We ventured into WIldberry on a very soggy Thursday morning! Luckily, the weather aided us being seated quickly. "
,,,,,The menu looked delicious and we were starving after coming unprepared to Chicago for a rainy day. I ordered the fig and apple bacon omelet with a side of fruit along with their specialty oreo pancakes. The omelet was the perfect size and wasn't over or underdone. The sweetness of the figs and the crunchyness of the bacon brought out wonderful flavors. The Oreo pancakes were TO DIE FOR! I usually prefer waffles to pancakes but these Oreo pancakes had me eating the center of the pancake so it looked like stone henge! The Oreo was still crispy inside the pancake and it was sprinkled with white and chocolate chips!!
,,,,,"My friend got the habernero sizzler which consisted of pulled pork, eggs and yummy spicy pita chips topped with avocado. She also got a side of cinnamon roll pancakes which I thought tasted more of butter."
,,,,,Food came fast and the prices were reasonable. We also had a mocha and a chai tea latte. Both were delicious! 
,,,,,Wildberry isn't hyped. Go for the pancakes!
,,,,,"Order the pancakes, and just the pancakes. They are light and fluffy and heavenly pillows of happiness. The Signature Berry Bliss pancakes are tart and fruity, while the banana coconut cream takes exactly like a luscious banana creme pie. I took one star off because the other breakfast dishes like the Denver skillet and the Napa Valley Fig omelette were not too impressive in taste, flavor, and presentation. The eggs were dry and the figs were not fresh and juicy. The portions are huge, so you will definitely have leftovers."
,,,,,"Your focus here should really be the amazing pancakes because it's what they do best. Heck, their name is Wildberry Pancakes! Just stick with lots of pancakes of different flavors."
,,,,,I visit this spot every time I am in Chicago!! I love the biscuits and sausage gravy with a side of sausage links! I tried the Oreo waffle as well this time and it was phenomenal!!!- was topped with ice cream too! I love to try a few different things while at wild berry..so be sure to go early and plan lunch a bit later !
,,,,,So. Much. Food!
,,,,,Wait time - Very fast despite a long line. 20 minutes on Thursday 12PM. 
,,,,,"Signature Berry Bliss Pancakes - Most popular item. Sweet, fruity, hearty. and a stack of 5 pancakes for $13. Way too much food. Only could stomach three or four bites. Plenty of maple syrup and blueberries were provided. "
,,,,,"Oreo S'more Pancakes - Rich, chocolate, thick. "
,,,,,"Mexicana Skillet (hash browns, cheddar and jack cheese, 2 eggs, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro, onions) - Rich, salty, heavy. "
,,,,,"Hash Browns - Fluffy, crisp, lots of burnt edges. "
,,,,,"Service - Excellent, cheery, joyful. "
,,,,,"Interior - Casual, clean."
,,,,,"This was one of the first restaurants I visited during covid-19 this summer. Be ready to wait as they don't take reservations. Earlier the better as the wait times are less. Plus this place shows wait time on yelp app so you can plan ahead. I went with the simple breakfast meal that comes with omelette, side of fries and 2 small pancakes. My husband and I split the food and it was quite filling. We ended up with a bill including coffee at about $20 which is not bad at all! My fav in this restaurant is the strawberry berry bliss pancake. All desserts here contain egg which is a bummer as I have stopped eating egg now! I wish they start accommodating people who have egg allergy but has a sweet tooth! This place is definitely a must go in the summers. We got seated outside on a beautiful Sunday sunny morning!"

,,,,,"I took my two dogs (a Shih Tzu and a Bichon Frise) there yesterday for brunch. A hispanic staff, probably the manager there, refused to give us an outside seat to serve us because we got there at 1:50 pm, which was understandable because they closed at 2 pm. I immediately called a Uber ready to leave. Chicago was super hot yesterday. So I asked the same guy if we could sit at the empty outside table in the shade while waiting for the Uber drive so that my dogs could rest a bit and have some water (I brought my own water) to cool down. He refused again even though they had quite a lot of customers still eating there. My dogs and I had to stand in the sun for 10 more minutes until our Uber driver picked us up. Consequently, one of my dogs - the Bichon Frise - suffered a heat stroke and peed cherry red blood. I'm more than fortunate that neither of my dogs died on me yesterday. I agreed to leave right after he explained about the closing time, but his refusing to let me and my dogs wait for our Uber drive by their empty and shaded outside table was really another level of cold-bloodiness. If they try to present any argument along the line of ""they had no duty to help"" would only further prove my previous point. This used to my favorite brunch place and I would take my dogs there at least once whenever we visited Chicago. I won't return again and they probably don't care because they have plenty of other customers. But still, I would share this experience here."
,,,,,We waited 45 mins for brunch here and it was worth it!!! 
,,,,,I was very happy with my experience here. 
,,,,,I got an Florence egg Benedict and my bf got a Mexicana skillet and a PSL. The Wildberry pancakes came as a side dish with the skillet.
,,,,,"The pancakes are pretty and have strawberry bitten, which was very delicious.  The portions are huge and we had to bring home some extra. Everything was flavorful."
,,,,,The service was fast and friendly. 
,,,,,I'd totally come back here again. 
,,,,,Highly recommend!!
,,,,,"My friends and I made the smart choice to place a reservation during their prime time on a Sunday. We arrived at 10:45am for our reservation and the place was packed! The lobby was packed and there was a long line outside the restaurant where people put themselves in the waitlist. It was also my friend's and I last day in Chicago and our last stop before heading back to the bus station. So we had bags, and the restaurant allowed us to store our bags right outside in a gated area which was connected to another building. The connected building was empty and there was a security personnel so I wasn't too worry about our bags."
,,,,,Now the food was worth it! I have ordered a skillet and you can substitute the side with a specialty pancake for $2. It was a super great deal because the Skillets were a generous serving and the specialty pancakes were big as well. My friends ordered the popular Signature Berry Bliss pancake and I got the Key Lime pancake. I've tried both and I personally love the Key Lime pancake more!
,,,,,No sweet vegan options. Many times in Chicago I come to a brunch spot and they always have a savory tofu scramble or 20$ avocado toast but never a vegan pancake or waffle option. Always a bummer. But my boyfriend and his friends loved the food.
,,,,,"Amazing brunch spot in a great location right near the Bean. They do yelp waitlist so you don't have to wait that long and can walk around Millenium park while waiting, especially on a beautiful days. Their service is insanely fast once you get in. We ordered the coconut banana cream pancakes and I swear to god these were the best pancakes I've ever had. We also got the mexicana scramble and that was delicious as well, especially once you add the sour cream. The price wasn't that bad because the portions are huge so you can share with friends. I didn't find this place overhyped at all and would 100% come again, and recommend everyone coming here. I would next time also try the berry pancakes and the chocolate chip banana as they looked so good as well."
,,,,,"Went here when they allowed indoor dining last month. Love love the food. We had a bit of a wait as there was a waiting list and a queue outside but it was well worth it. Be warned though, don't come here when you are too hungry because you may not be able to wait. Prices were decent for the portion but since it is a brunch place, they do close fairly early so check the hours before going."
,,,,,"Wow!  This place is definitely worth a visit if you're in Chicago.  The pancakes were absolute perfection.  Fluffy, flavorful and light. The omelette was very delicious and the portions were so big, I couldn't finish my plate and I always always finish my plate. The prices were much cheaper than I thought but expect 15-20 per person.  "
,,,,,Highly highly recommend. 
,,,,,Pros: 
,,,,,Food is incredible
,,,,,Staff is friendly (Jennifer was amazing)
,,,,,Fast service
,,,,,Healthy options 
,,,,,Veggie and vegan options 
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,Closes at  2:30 pm on Sunday 
,,,,,Coffee was blah but as good as Starbucks
,,,,,Update: it's a day later and I came back. French toast melts in your mouth.  I may need rehab to fight this new addiction.
,,,,,I'm not a huge breakfast person but I will always visit Wildberry when I'm in town! Signature berry bliss pancakes are a must & you can never go wrong with the butcher block skillet. Service has always been great here & at the Streeterville location as well.
,,,,,"To be honest, I was kind of underwhelmed by our brunch experience at Wildberry. To start, the waitlist feature is somewhat inaccurate in representing how long it will actually take for you to be seated. We checked in to the waitlist ~9 AM and the app told us to arrive at the restaurant by 11 AM (yes, it really did say a two hour wait.) When we got to the restaurant, we were told by the host that the 11 am time was just an estimate and that it would actually be another 30 to 45 minutes before we were seated. (!!!) Not super thrilled about that especially when I feel like people rely on the waitlist feature to make plans. Also, I've never been told that at any other restaurant that uses the Waitlist feature. "
,,,,,"Once we were actually seated, I was disappointed unfortunately with both the service and food. The service was somewhat slow, not surprising since it was very busy, but I still expected us to receive our utensils by the time that we actually received our meal, and this did not happen. We actually had to ask for utensils after our plates of food already arrived. The food itself was not great either. They forgot to put hashbrowns on my boyfriends plate, and his eggs Benedict had about 2 cups of spinach under each poached egg. It was as if a home cook was in the kitchen. The hashbrowns were also very under seasoned. I basically had 2 bites and stopped eating them. The seasonal special French toast we ordered (peaches and corn flake) was also extremely dry and difficult to eat. "
,,,,,"Overall, I felt like this place was very over hyped and I won't be back again."
,,,,,Wow I like this place. It's a hopening but wait only 20 minutes.
,,,,,They of course have a salection of specialty pancakes delicious. Had the cinnamon roll pancakes with a omelette. I stuffed myself it was so good. We'll be back probably today

,,,,,"Started off our first full day in Chicago by grabbing breakfast at Wildberry!! Man oh man they did not disappoint!! Service was great!! We walked in and were seated right away, ice cold water magically appeared on our table...seriously I NEVER saw water brought out to use but it was!! We ordered the famous wild berry pancakes and the skillet with hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, ham and cheese with 2 eggs over easy on top!! Portions are hearty and one dish is enough to share with 2 people!! The coffee was good also!! The food came out fast, hot and was DELICIOUS!! I really wish we had a Wildberry back in San Diego!! What a great day to start the day!!"
,,,,,"I enjoyed this place a lot.  So much so, we ate here 2 times within the trip.  First and most important (which got us to go here) is their system.  Everything is run smooth from a consumer standpoint.  Starting with a wait-list you can join from the yelp app.  You just need to show up 5 mins before your reservation time to check in.  There is plenty of staff helping and keeping things orderly as it is a very crowded place.  As for service, well, that was great too!  Our servers were both attentive, food was brought out quick, hot and accurate.  "
,,,,,"I really enjoyed both my meals.  The avocado toast was different then what I usually have, but very good.  "
,,,,,"As soon as we were done eating and paid the bill, we were never rushed, but once we got up, there was staff ready to clean off the table and turn it over for the next guest.  They are doing it right!"
,,,,,Definitely on my list of places to return to.
,,,,,"After an early flight, this was just what I needed to fuel up for the day. Jeremy did a great job and the food came out quickly. "
,,,,,"I had the Barbacoa Chilaquiles with sunny side up eggs - delicious! Definitely upgrade to one of the specialty pancakes. I added the Blueberry Danish pancakes and they were fantastic! I was only able to finish about half, which will make a nice snack for later on."
,,,,,Use the check-in ahead on Yelp to cut the wait time.
,,,,,Hands down the best pancake restaurant I've ever been in! It was super busy.. we went at 8:30 and still had to line up for 30 mins. But turnover is fast.
,,,,,"Most of my party ordered the seniors breakfast since they didn't have such a big appetite in the morning, but my hubby got their corned beef skillet and upgraded to lemon blackberry pancakes. I ordered the corned beef Benedict and it was just AMAZING. Mine came with plain buttermilk pancakes on the side and even that alone was so fluffy and delicious with just some simple syrup."
,,,,,The lemon blackberry pancakes were sooo good. It taste just like the dessert but in the form of a pancake   
,,,,,The Benedict was perfectly cooked and went amazingly well with corned beef. The skillet was so good with fried potatoes and corned beef. You seriously can't go wrong with so many choices on their menu.
,,,,,Service was fast but I can see why since it's so busy. But it was definitely worth the effort!
,,,,,"The ""W"" in Wildberry stands for WOW. This was the perfect midweek brunch spot! There was NO wait which is unheard of- if you plan to go on the weekend definitely use the waitlist option on the YELP app because they do not take call in reservations. We opted for the 2 eggs anyway & speciality pancakes for the $2 up charge. So worth it! Large portions at such an affordable price. Amazing customer service. They also have turkey sausage and turkey bacon which is always a win! I will definitely be returning when I'm back in the city!"
,,,,,"Best gluten free pancakes I've ever had! We will definitely be back the next time we're in Chicago! Would love to see the Yelp waitlist option back up and running, however. Especially during COVID, it wasn't ideal to wait in a huge crowd of people. Just a side note. Everything was perfect otherwise!"
,,,,,Love their chilaquiles and French toast. 
,,,,,The long was a little long but it's definitely worth it and we didn't wait long for our food.
,,,,,Great breakfast! DEFINITELY add yourself to YELPS waitlist!!!! We walked right in and got seated while there was a fullllly packed lobby waiting to be seated. Service was great and so was food!
,,,,,"Food was delicious! The waiter was amazing, and everyone was so attentive and any issues were promptly taken care of! Will definitely be returning!"
,,,,,"Food is really good here! They have a large assortment of breakfast items. You can put yourself on the waitlist from yelp as there will likely be a wait for Saturday or Sunday morning. Once they said the table was ready & we would have had another ~10 min wait or so to sit inside. However, they had outdoor seating available immediately so we did that. "

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Amazing breakfast!  Would highly recommend. Staff was friendly and service was great. Very large portions so be prepared to be stuffed. Had to wait a bit but was worth the wait.
,,,,,"My husband and I visited here for breakfast.  We were able to join the waitlist from Yelp, which was amazing.  We waited about ten minutes after we arrived to be seated.  Our waitress was very professional and experienced.  She was nice, albeit almost robotic.  But, we understand that the restaurant is very busy and she was very quick.  I started with the chocolate vanilla swirl smoothie.Do not think that this will taste like a milkshake!  I made that mistake.  It is not as thick.  It was still pretty good though!  I had a hard time deciding what to order as everything on the menu looked amazing.  I chose the berry bliss crepes.  They were very good!  I also got a side of the applewood smoked bacon.  I was not very impressed by the bacon, but it still hit the spot.  My husband got an omelette which was huge!  "
,,,,,"Overall, the food and service were excellent.  Definitely join the waitlist in advance if possible.  Expect a quick turnaround, but know it's because the food is so good that everyone wants to eat there!  :)"
,,,,,"Amazing, worth the wait, and I am drooling..."
,,,,,"First things first, GO ON YELP AND ADD YOURSELF TO THE WAITLIST! The wait here was insane! I came here on a Saturday morning (8:30am) and the wait was about 2 hours because I didn't add myself to the waitlist prior to coming! Granted I spent that time going to Intelligentsia for coffee and explored Millenium Park (and the bean), but 2 hours!!!"
,,,,,"Alright, so the service and food were fantastic. FANTASTIC. I tried their famous berry bliss pancakes (YES GET THIS), their beef hash, and breakfast torta. Their beef came with a side of regular pancakes, so I just subbed these regular pancakes for the famous berry bliss. There is an upcharge, BUT DO IT.  "
,,,,,"The price of everything was super reasonable and we had leftovers. Whatever you do, make sure you come here for breakfast during your Chicago visit. It will not disappoint if you get their famous berry bliss pancakes."
,,,,,"Bottom line: great breakfast/ lunch spot, go"
,,,,,"Long line: had a great time here. The lines are long for good reason. The food is absolutely delicious. I forget the name of my dish, but as pictured it was huge and had hashbrowns, eggs, the works. My friend got their special pancakes and they too were amazing. Service was quick and friendly. I would definitely return."
,,,,,"Fearing the long wait time for a table based on other reviews, we went super early around 7am on a Monday to beat the crowds. There was no wait for a table at all, and we were seat promptly upon entering."
,,,,,"The berry bliss pancakes ($13) were heavenly, the perfect balance of sweet and tart! Lots of berries included on the side as well. Portion size was big, bf and I shared the pancake plate and an egg/sausages/hash browns on the side, we both left happily full."
,,,,,"Service was good, bathrooms were plentiful and clean. "

,,,,,"First time visiting Chicago and I checked on yelp places to eat, Wildberry Pancakes was on the top list to try so I thought why not I can give it a try. I made yelp reservation and it was about 30-40 mins but by the time I walked and got to the restaurant, it was perfect timing. I looked on yelp for recommendations and I saw the Benedict's so I got the Los Altos Benedict, it has the chorizo Sausage and I don't eat there so I substituted it for avocado. So I got my food, and for fresh orange juice. The avocado was dark!! The food tasted disgusting!! The eggs were really runny unlike the way it usually is for Benedict's. I don't recommend it to anybody."

,,,,,"I would go somewhere else and try something else, not worth the wait. I also think it's over rated."
,,,,,"This is one of best breakfast place in town, I love stopping here when we I'm in the Chicago area."
,,,,,Can't go wrong ordering anything at this great place.
,,,,,Highly recommended
,,,,,"If you're going to splurge on brunch (in terms of calories), this is the place to do it. Put yourself on the waitlist on yelp when you're at least 5 miles away from the restaurant. This will decrease the wait time to about an hour. Recommend to look at menu and order immediately when you sit down. Food comes out hot, delicious, and fast. The veggie omelette with hash browns is my personal favorite."
,,,,,more like a 4.5 !
,,,,,"i visited today and ordered the breakfast burrito (with hash browns) and the chocolate chip banana pancakes. warning: the pancakes are definitely a two person portion ! next time, i might just order the kids size pancakes because it's less than half the price and i have no idea how one human can consume all of these pancakes !! the burrito was so yummy; the chorizo is more of a loose texture, and is perfect with the avocado and cheese. the burrito also comes with salsa and sour cream. the pancakes had a great ""bite""; they're not as fluffy /soft as other pancakes but tbh, i like this texture more ! it comes with plenty of chocolate chips and chocolate syrup and bananas. if you can, get two dishes to share (one sweet and one salty). i would definitely visit again !!"
,,,,,covid things: outdoor AND indoor seating was socially distanced. they ask you to wear your mask whenever engaging with a server (which is great !) and all of the other customers were respectful and followed all the rules. i felt safe visiting today (:
,,,,,Definitely worth the wait for this place! We went on Sunday at 8am and there was already a 15-30 minute wait. Highly recommend joining the yelp waitlist before heading over and get there earlier rather than later!
,,,,,They have a few outdoor spots which were really nice - we were fortunate enough to be able to sit there. Very large menu with so many different options. They're known for the pancakes (obviously) so make sure you try those!!
,,,,,We ended up getting the southern eggs Benedict and the  espanola omelette. For the inlet you are able to upgrade your regular side of pancakes to one of their signatures which was nice. Both dishes were delicious and SO filling. 
,,,,,"Don't let the lines intimidate you, they move by pretty fast & the food is worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Great brunch location! Time for us to sit down was short and you can do waitlist online which is nice. The place is crowded, but that's expected with it being so popular. The signature pancakes are great! Our food came out quickly for a group of 7! Our waiter was nice and accommodating with splitting checks. Food variety is normal brunch fare, pancakes and waffles and omelette. Good sized portions too. Split an omelette and side of pancakes between two people. Would definitely recommend for brunch."
,,,,,The food is very good but the portions are ridiculously too big. I sent the other five pounds of hash browns to feed three impoverished nations. 
,,,,,"They also play heavily on the fats, which, on a Sunday, may sound fun, but they could do a lot more with flavor, and keep my tailor less busy. "
,,,,,"The hash browns were fresh, a bit greasy but bland. I ordered bacon medium, and it came out well done. Sigh. "
,,,,,The Belgian waffle was great. 
,,,,,Service was excellent. Wait was reasonable even though there there were a lot of people. 
,,,,,"Oh, there are a lot of people. Earlier is probably less crowded."
,,,,,First stop in Chicago after a red-eye flight and Wildberry did just the trick! I was glad to see Wildberry open really early; it's a shame that they don't offer breakfast all day since they close at 2:30 PM everyday. There's bound to be a wait when you go so I would suggest putting your name on the wait list ahead of time via Yelp. I love that feature! We timed our arrival to the restaurant around when our name would be called. Talk about efficiency!
,,,,,"The portions here are huge. I opted for the butcher block skillet with the signature berry bliss pancakes and I thought it was pretty good. The pancakes were the home run for me. It was like biting out of a cloud! Had I known the pancakes would be that good, I wouldn't just ordered pancakes and nothing else. With that said, I appreciated how the skillet kept the dish warm but wasn't amazed by it. If you're a meat lover, you'd enjoy the butcher block but I thought the dish was alright. There are a ton of different meats where you kind of feel overwhelmed by it."
,,,,,"Wildberry is a great choice for breakfast. If you're planning to come here, I would highly suggest putting your name down on the wait list ahead of time via the Yelp app."
,,,,,The food was great!!!! Large pancakes and thick cut bacon. The wait was about 45-60 min on a Friday but time seemed to fly by with all the people talking about what they were going to eat when they got in. The menu is jam packed with great options. 
,,,,,The hot chocolate that I had was amazing!!!
,,,,,Things I didn't like- 
,,,,,1- Our server was either tone def or she just was really loud!!!! She was basically screaming at us and then would answer all of our questions by repeating the question and then answering it.  
,,,,,"2- when we sat down we were ready to order our meal and drink, thinking we could since we waited an hour but were told we had to do it separate! ((Where they do that at))"
,,,,,3- you can't pay with a gift card only debit/credit or a Wildberry gift card 
,,,,,Overall a good experience and good food 
,,,,,Enjoy
,,,,,"Well this was actually 2 months ago in September. A fellow friend's sister was nice enough to give me a ride back to Chicago since my motorcycle was repaired and I had to store it in the countryside of Huntley, IL. Anyways out of kindness and generosity as well as to enlightened her knowledge of restaurants in the suburbs I suggested we eat here at Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe in Schaumburg, IL. Despite being busy later that day as usual we ate outside.  I think she had ordered the Mexicana skillet and she loved it. I wanted more Crepes and got the Blueberry Danish Crepe with a side of their delicious sausage and some eggs since I did NOT eat Breakfast that morning. It was more brunch since we arrived 10 am. I ordered an orange juice which was fresh as usual but I should have ordered their warm apple cider since it was that season of late September early October. Sadly I did not take pictures because i was savoring that moment as well as have a relaxing time with my sister from another. Portions were generous and she took some of her food home to savor. I on the other hand was very hungry and finished.  This place is in competition with another franchise that is just as good which is Original Pancakehouse Walker Brothers. They are both good at 4 stars but none can be better so it is a tough choice to downgrade one over the other in my opinion or judgement."
,,,,,"AMAZING PANCAKES!!! And great prices for this area!!! During a 5 day visit to Chicago, I came here for breakfast/brunch 3 of my days here. It would've been 5/5 if I had discovered this place sooner. This place is what IHOP wishes they could be. I got the same thing every time I went, and while I should've branched out, the Oreo pancakes were too good to pass up on repeat visits. Prices were best when ordering an egg/protein and adding the $2 for specialty pancakes. Can't beat a FULL breakfast for $14. The fresh hot apple cider was also amazing!"
,,,,,Will definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago! And the Yelp waitlist was FAB for saving time and getting on the list before I even left my conference hotel!
,,,,,Some of the best brunch items I've had in Chicago.  The vibe is upscale but casual with an AWESOME view.
,,,,,"I had the Blackberry Key Lime Pancakes.  Damn, they were good.   And filling.  My friend had a Mexican Skillet meal with hash brown, sausage, eggs, etc.  Looked great.  I think I'll get that next time I eat here."
,,,,,"This is a glorified IHOP with 1+ hour wait time. The service was great, but food was not. Definitely not worth the long waits to eat here."
,,,,,First things first...Make a reservation on Yelp and save yourself at least 45 minutes of waiting. We were really excited to try Wildberry given its rave reviews. This one is located right across from the Bean. We ordered a veggie omelette and a side of pancakes which was more than enough food for the two of us. The portions are huge here. I saw everyone ordering their own separate dishes and not being able to finish so i would advise you to take the smaller side version of the pancakes. The coffee here is great too. Must visit in Chicago!
,,,,,"Check-in EARLY, this is a well-known, delicious-as-heck brunch spot and it's a delight to eat but a fight to get in. Hard to be number one! :D"

,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes and Café came highly recommended when we were planning our vacation to Chicago. We were also warned about the long wait and was told to get there early. My husband and I walked from our hotel and on the way, I noticed we were able to join the waitlist via Yelp. This saved us over 45 minutes of waiting. When we arrived, we only had to wait about 15 minutes. This was a win for us, I couldn't believe how many people were there waiting to be seated. I thought to myself this must be a great place...spoiler alert.. it was. "
,,,,,"I had to try their iced hazelnut latte. This was an awesome choice. For breakfast, I had the minced ham and cheddar eggs with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. The cinnamon roll pancakes may have been the best pancakes I've ever had. I cannot say enough good things, a must try! "
,,,,,"If you ever have the opportunity, try this place out because you will not be disappointed."
,,,,,"I decided upon Wildberry for a weekday brunch based on the reasonable prices, extensive menu, and convenient downtown location. When I arrived, my friend and I were immediately seated at a small table in the middle of the bustling dining area. Pro Tip: If you're looking for a place where you can have an intimate conversation, this is not the place. Wildberry is crowded and loud! However, we were there for the food and the people watching, so our seats were perfect!"
,,,,,"Within just a minute or two of being seated, our waiter arrived at our table to answer our questions and take our drink order. I ordered the ""Signature Berry Bliss"" pancakes ($13) and a hazelnut latte ($4.50). The only reason I'm giving Wildberry 4 stars instead of 5 is because my hazelnut latte was made with spoiled milk. I took a couple of sips, passed it over to my friend to make absolutely sure, and then sent the latte back. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and immediately offered to replace the latte with any drink on the menu, but I settled for water and pancakes. My friend got an iced tea and said it was delicious."
,,,,,"My pancakes were the real star of the meal! WOW! Not only were the pancakes fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth good, but they were covered in heaps of fresh fruit (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries). I could have easily shared with someone and still been full. "
,,,,,"I was very impressed with the service we received; even though Wildberry was bustling with morning brunch traffic our waiter checked on us frequently and promptly brought us the check and boxes when we asked. I would absolutely recommend the pancakes, and I know my friend enjoyed her omelette and hash browns as well. When we left it only took us a couple of minutes to wander over to The Bean and then down to the Lakefront in the hopes of burning off some of those calories.  I will return my next trip to Chicago!"
,,,,,"Quaint breakfast spot right next to Millenium Park with great pancakes and coffee, as well as a large selection of breakfast and lunch items."
,,,,,We arrived at 11:00 am and had about a 30 minute wait for a table. My husband ordered breakfast and I opted for lunch.
,,,,,He had the corned beef hash skillet with two eggs and hash browns and upgraded to the cinnamon roll pancakes. 
,,,,,"I ordered the chicken salad sandwich with fresh fruit. The sandwich was served on fresh whole grain toast and I had the option of choosing chips, fruit or French fries or sweet potato fries, additional sides choices were soup or side salad for an extra $1.50.  The chicken salad was very flavorful and made with grapes, apples, cranberries and raisins. "
,,,,,"The fruit was a small serving of fruit salad consisting of cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberries, grapes and honeydew melon. "
,,,,,I also had a bite of the cinnamon roll pancake which was awesome! I would probably order that if I ever went back.
,,,,,Excellent service and the food was fresh and flavorful. Great location next to the park!
,,,,,"Great restaurant, great food & located very close to where I live are all HUGE positives BUT the only drawback I find is that most of the waitstaff are EXTREMELY SLOW !!!  I always get there first thing in the morning when they open their doors, basically every week, and Im one of their first customers in the door but it'll take up to 10 minutes many times before someone approaches me and asks would I like something to drink while most of them sit in a corner eatin', drinkin' and chattin' until they're ready to get up! This morning very well may have been my last time there. If a restaurant opens up at 7:00 then the employees should be expected to start then!!!!!!!This was a loyal customer who is tired of experiencing this practically on a weekly basis!!!! "
,,,,,They would definitely be a 4 or 5 star review if it wasn't for this FACT!
,,,,,Fantastic food. I ordered From Wildberry pancakes because the pictures they had were so enticing. I am pleasantly surprised that the food in the pictures taste better than they look. When back in Chicago I will definitely will be revisiting this experience.
,,,,,"Food is awesome and service is great. Beware: food portions are big, so come hungry!"
,,,,,"Make sure to join the waitlist online; otherwise, you'll be waiting a while. Arrive with your entire party or they won't seat you. Popular place!"
,,,,,Brunch brunch brunch!  Who doesn't love brunch?  The cool thing about this place is that you can check in on yelp.  So it's super convenient!  
,,,,,"So my friends and I were at our hotel and we put our name on the list.  Walked there and let the hostess know.  We still had to wait about 20 mins but it wasn't too bad.  The weather was nice so we sat outside and waited.   Then we received a text that told us to go inside.  So we did and waited about 5 minutes then we got seated.  Our waiter came to out table (super friendly guy) took our drink order.  Then he came back and We ordered a bbq chicken salad, eggs bene, and an omelette with pancakes.   I don't eat bacon so the waiter offered me turkey bacon.  Which was super nice of him. They brought out my eggs bene and then he realized the kitchen forgot the bacon so he brought me a new one without me even asking!   "
,,,,,"The food was amazing, the service was amazing!  If I'm ever in Chicago again.  I DEFINITELY WILL BE BACK!!!"
,,,,,"Excellent service, great utilization of Yelp waitlists, and great selection of yummy breakfast dishes! I got a Vegan breakfast hash and made it non-Vegan (oops!) by adding bacon and scrambeled eggs. It was delicious and a huge portion. The fruit on the side was tasty and refreshing. I've had Wildberry in Schaumburg, and it was great as well."
,,,,,"This restaurant was pretty good, highly recommend making reservations, If not you will be waiting at least an hour to get a seat due to his popular location right beside Millennium Park."
,,,,,Oh my god..I can't remember the last time I had such an amazing brunch. Wildberry literally had me dumbfounded by how good it was. 
,,,,,"~ Mexicana: hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, Chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro & onions. This skillet was incredible..perfectly crisp hash browns, melted cheese mixed with hearty "
,,,,,"Chorizo topped with roasted jalapenos for a nice kick. If you're looking for something with a slight kick in spice, I'd recommend this one!"
,,,,,"~ Butcher Block: hash browns, two eggs, cheddar & jack cheese, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage & bacon. If you've ever watched Parks & Rec, this is literally a breakfast that Ron Swanson would be pleased to eat (it's a meat lovers galore)."
,,,,,~ Signature Berry Bliss Pancakes: soft & fluffy pancakes topped with some beautiful berry concoction. This was sweet & delicious. I was honestly kinda sad when I had my last bite because this was so good..

,,,,,This is one of our go-to's when we visit family in Chicago. The pancakes are fluffy and tasty. I'm a Benedict's type of guy and they have unique options.
,,,,,"Came here on a Sunday during president's day weekend at 7:30am for the first time in Chicago and found this place through Yelp. We are visiting from New York City and decided the abundance of reviews made it ""worth it"" to check out for brunch. We came as a party of 3 and noticed it was probably at 60% capacity when we were seated. That just goes to show how packed it usually gets based on google's live wait times which we were prepared for."
,,,,,"We had the signature ""bliss"" pancakes, Banana cream pie pancakes, the garden skillet, eggs benedict, French roast coffee, and fresh squeezed OJ."
,,,,,"Pancake portions are HUGE! Stacked 5 high with the toppings of your choice. I really liked the eggs benedict, orange juice, and the banana cream pie pancakes. The berry bliss pancakes were a little on the more sugary side but overall good. The garden skillet was good too as an alternative to pancakes if you are looking for something hearty."
,,,,,"Our server was excellent, she came by with extra coffee at no additional charge twice and was really accommodating with extra napkins and condiments."
,,,,,"We spent around a hour 'ish here  and noticed a lot of people waiting when we stepped out. Overall, we enjoyed the food but might try other breakfast spots next time."
,,,,,PROs: Pancakes!! Orange Juice!
,,,,,Cons: None.
,,,,,"One of my good friends first recommended this place to me a while back, and I knew when I was in the city I'd have to try it out.  And WOW is this place good.  "
,,,,,The place gets insanely packed and busy regardless of time (but especially mornings) but the lines still move fairly quickly.  Employees are friendly and the vibe is such a fast-paced environment - I love it.  
,,,,,"I got the breakfast burrito and it was great.  Size was decent and prices are extremely fair.  I ordered their Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice and it's actually the FIRST place I've been to that hasn't lied about this - every other ""Fresh Squeezed OJ"" I've had at other places is clearly store bought.  This already made me happy.  To add on top of that, their quality and speed of service, food is a place that will keep me coming back every time.  If you're in the area, make sure you stop by Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe!"
,,,,,***Make sure you check-in line on Yelp if the waitlist is open!***
,,,,,"This place was so good, they have the best pancakes I have ever had, and they have the most amazing breakfast around the city. Satisfyingly delicious is how I'd describe their food, they have large portions, lots of selection, and they have big menu. Everything at their menu is so tasty and well-presented, they will serve your order so fast, and you can literally know that their food is fresh and new. I really love their signature pancakes, it is so thick, flavorful, and at the same time it melts inside my mouth. This is a must visit place if you are in town, especially when you are looking for some vegetarian and healthy food. They are so freaking good. 5-star for this place because of their amazing customer service, their place is so big, their staff is so accommodating, and also their food is so awesome and phenomenal. Thank you Wildberry Pancakes and Café for such a wonderful experience. Definitely go back there again when I am nearby. Highly recommend pancake place! Keep it up! Kudos!"
,,,,,AMAZING! We came on a Monday morning and there were several people waiting outside. We went to the hostess and were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. It was well worth it.
,,,,,The food: 
,,,,,"I ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles skillet...omg!!! I wish I could have that EVERY DAY! The flavor was incredible and I highly recommend it. It's a party in your mouth. I also tried the signature Berry Bliss pancakes. Those were also pretty tasty, although I wouldn't recommend them unless you enjoy VERY sweet breakfast items. My boyfriend ordered the Garden Skillet and added chorizo sausage. That was delicious. The food was phenomenal."
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"I have zero complaints. Everyone from the hostess, to the server, the the busboy was extremely friendly and helpful. Our server gave very good suggestions and was very pleasant. I had a wonderful experience."
,,,,,This place is a must try when you are in Chicago.
,,,,,"I flew into Chicago Sunday morning early, I was starving and saw this cute restaurant on the way to my hotel. Great friendly service! The food and atmosphere were all outstanding. I will definitely eat here again."
,,,,,So... let's keeps it real. 
,,,,,"I can see the hype with the pancakes, but the brisket hash and butcher block skillet fell far short. First off, the plates are instagram worthy. Looks amazing! "
,,,,,The deets:
,,,,,"The savory dishes were heavily under seasoned from the potatoes to the meat itself. The seasoning needs some soul... some weight to it. I almost never add salt to my food, but this needed a lot of help along with a good ol healthy amount of Tabasco and cholula. Although they win massive points for HOW the dishes were cooked (brisket were tender, poached eggs were perfection...), it's the taste were they fell from grace. "
,,,,,"The pancakes, however, were very tasty. Perfect texture, moist but has that bounce and slight crisp all around. The toppings for the berry bliss and key lime was on point, but I didn't taste the key lime at all. I asked for the cookie crumbles to be put on the side, and I was glad I did that."
,,,,,"The wait time (wait list via yelp) was almost 2 hours on a Monday (but it's Labor Day, so keep that in mind). I put in my name at 930ish and wasn't seated until around 11am - and I took the soonest seat which was outside. "
,,,,,"All in all, I'm glad I checked it out, but with the wait time and a tab of $50 for 2 people for breakfast, I say I'm not itching to go back to this place any time soon."
,,,,,"We made it in the door less than ten minutes before closing. The owner was super sweet, he told us to order in five minutes and we could stay as long as we like. Despite the proximity to closing time, it was packed with happy, well fed customers. We had a new waiter who messed up a few times, but his trainer quickly fixed the mistakes. All of our food came out hot from the kitchen within minutes."
,,,,,"Berry pancakes: wow, these are by far the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They were as fluffy as a cloud. Each layer had berry creamy filling and was topped by a huge swirl of it. The stack is massive - five plate sized cakes. "
,,,,,"Los Altos Benedict: this was a spicy twist to a classic dish. The eggs are perfectly poached. They pile on chorizo onto the English muffins. The hash browns were a little soggy, but still tasty. "
,,,,,I can't wait to return. This is definitely my new favorite brunch spot.
,,,,,"Ordered strawberry almond French toast and still cut oatmeal. Food is delicious and presentation also looks great. All staff is friendly, the lady waitress was attentive and I had a really cozy brunch here. But i have to admit, next time I'd skip on cappuccino but it's just me being picky. Overall place is very nice no wonder they had a waiting line outside. I'll be coming back to try another things from the menu"
,,,,,"Don't be surprised to see a long line - if you're a SMART YELPER - you'll get on the list from the YELP app and save some wait time. We got on the list, walked from our hotel, and our wait was minimal. #smartYELPer"
,,,,,"I went with the corned beef hash skillet ($14). A pile of hash browns, topped with corned beef, cheddar and jack cheese, and 2 eggs - served in a skillet. The meal includes a side of pancakes and I upgraded those from buttermilk to the cinnamon roll flavor for $2. #worthit #nosyrupnecessary"
,,,,,"Great stuff - this place is close to Millenium Park, just a block from the AON center and two blocks from the Bean (Cloudgate). Seriously a prime location with great food means they need to run like a well oiled machine to keep up with demand. They are and they do. There are 3 other locations and if they are run like this one, kudos to them."

,,,,,One word: overhyped pancakes
,,,,,"I came here around 1 pm. I was very interested because this brunch place had such highly rated reviews that I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I was walking around downtown and waitlisted on the app. It said it was about an hour wait but my number in line kept dropping fast. I tried to rush to the restaurant, and the waiters said that if I wasn't there in a minute they were going to give up my table. I ran as fast as I could and came in all sweaty because I was trying to make it to the restaurant. I thought it was pretty rude they wouldn't wait 1 more minute even though the app said I wasn't 1st place in line but 8th. However, I got seated and was able to dine there for brunch."
,,,,,"I asked the waiter what he recommended, and he said the signature berry bliss pancakes  (2/5) and the barbacoa chilaquiles (3.5/5). I ended up ordering that with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes (4.5/5) (comes with barbacoa chilaquiles for a dollar extra). The waiter wasn't very nice - I asked him if we could order and he proceeds to take the order of the table next to us before taking our order even though we arrived first and I asked him first. The signature berry bliss pancakes weren't anything special - just tasted like pancakes with strawberries and blueberries on it. The barbacoa chilaquiles was good but something I could easily make at home. The cinnamon roll pancakes were really good, but I wouldn't come back for it. Overall, the portions were huge. I could've easily just done the barbacoa chilaquiles by itself because it comes with a side of pancakes. "
,,,,,"Overall experience was poor, and I would definitely not come back. I was very disappointed because the food and service were lacking."
,,,,,"Wildberry is a great option while in Chicago.  It's especially good for those of us who are early risers.  There just aren't a lot of places open super early, so I'm happy to have them.  We've now been here more than once.  I would say that the food is good, but not something I crave or rave about.  When I'm here I don't really get anything outside of a normal, basic breakfast of eggs and sausage so I cannot attest to the amazing-looking sweet options they offer.  The coffee is average and serves the purpose during breakfast.  "
,,,,,"This place supposedly gets very busy, so take advantage of getting in line with the Yelp app when you're on your way!  We've always arrived very early and never had a problem getting seated right away."
,,,,,"This place was amazing! The food was delicious and in a big portion !!! I'm not a pancake fanatic, but I was one when I tried their Signature Berry Bliss. These pancakes were the perfect way to end the salty dish. The Mexican skillet definitely had the Mexican touch. Despite the restaurant being so busy, the service was great! I would probably be there every weekend if I was from Chicago. Super family friendly, must try if you're visiting!"
,,,,,"We were in Chicago for the weekend and we definitely knew we had to try this place as most helpers had a lot of good things to say about it. We had to get in line on the no wait all, and that kinda gave me the idea that this would be a really good brunch spot. "
,,,,,"I Love this place. The pancakes were out of this world. I had the berry bliss pancakes (HOLY COW) so amazing, with a side of sweet potato fries and my partner had the skillet. ALL YUMMY! I also had the strawberry lemonade and I'm going to do everything I can to find a restaurant in nyc where i can constantly have it. When I find something I like, I could literally eat/drink it everyday.. I know! I'm annoying like that lol! Kelsey was a good waitress who advised us properly. (I hope I got her name right) i would definitely come back here."

,,,,,"I am definitely an eggs & bacon kind of gal but the pancakes here made me rethink all my previous breakfast decisions in my life. I got the butcher block skillet and I don't recommend it. Its a lot of fatty ham and sausage. I HIGHLY recommend the Oreos pancakes. Now the last times few times that I've been, I have split eggs& bacon or omelet and split the Oreos pancakes. That's the best"
,,,,,The best experience ever . Even though they was wait time it was totally worth it . Very well organized you can give your phone number for a table and they give your a text once the table is ready . But the best part was food ! I had sizzler along with signature berry pancake . It was aaamaaaazing !
,,,,,Folks line up here like they are giving something away. They are not. The portions are huge--too huge--and the menu is inventive. The quality is only OK and the prices are fairly high.
,,,,,With their  Covid accomidations I felt super safe

,,,,,"Wildberry was a random pick for me during my visit to Chicago, but certainly not a disappointment! There was indoor and outdoor seating but the outdoor seating was at capacity during my visit. There was nothing exciting about the indoor ambiance, but it was very open and the temperature was perfect. During my dining, I had their signature berry bliss crepes and an iced vanilla latte, as well as a side a bacon. The portions were generous and the flavors were delectable. I'm not a big pancake or waffle fan due to how filling they can be, so for me, the crepes were the perfect compromise to still explore the flavors of Wildberry without leaving half my food on the plate. The servers were tentative and courteous, and made sure to keep my water glass full. All in all this was a great experience and I am happy to have dined here during my visit."
,,,,,I love a good breakfast.  
,,,,,Omelette.  Hash.  Great coffee.
,,,,,Service was responsive.  
,,,,,"It's a little weird they open so late, but it was worth the wait.  "
,,,,,Great place.
,,,,,started with the white hot chocolate and it was yummy and topped With plenty of whip cream. For the main I had the southern eggs Benedict. It was very tasty and large potion. Briskets topped with a sausage patty topped with an egg and covered with sausage gravy. My wife ha the s'mores Oreo pancakes and really liked them   The best breakfast we have had in Chicago and deserves the star rating it has
,,,,,If there is one place I would die eating of pancakes then this is it!! I love there signature Berry Bliss pancakes they are my favorite.
,,,,,Must visit list for Chicago. Absolutely everything about this place was great. They have quite a wait so it's a good idea to make a reservation before hand - you can make a reservation online too. ( expect about an hour long wait for weekends)
,,,,,"Service- fast, helpful, polite"
,,,,,"Food- everything's great. I tried their Mexicana skillet- simply wow. My friend got Benedict- was good. Another friend got the espanola omelette - was delicious too. Their strawberry pancakes are a must try, you can add those for a $2 surcharge to your omelette or skillet"
,,,,,All their lattes were great too. My personal favorite was hazelnut latte. My friend got the vanilla latte which was pretty good too.
,,,,,"This place 100% lives up to the hype. Tip: get on the Yelp waitlist when you're nearby at least an hour before you plan to sit down & eat. Yes, it's that popular! "
,,,,,"We all got different entrees but of course split some pancakes, because how can you not here? The food was DELICIOUS, all so fresh and flavorful."
,,,,,"Knowing that this place gets crowded, we went around 8:30 on a Saturday morning. We didn't have to wait for a table. They are very efficient, we sat down, someone brought us water, another person our silverware and our waiter was right behind them. You pull the menu up on your phone. We ordered the seasonal French toast-Banana bread with candied walnuts and cinnamon praline butter. Three huge pieces of deliciousness! We also had the eggs, bacon, pancakes and hash browns. So good and filling. Everyone was very attentive, my water glass was never half empty! When we left, there were people waiting everywhere. I would suggest going here to get breakfast that will give you energy for the day. But I would say go early if you don't want to wait and make sure all members of your party are with you, you won't be seated until they are."
,,,,,"Ouch what a wait, but it's so worth it!  We used Yelp to get checked in online, which saved us a bunch of time.  We were able to kill some time at the Prudential building next door to avoid the cooler weather and were seated pretty promptly.  Service was great - very friendly and fast.  We ended up with the eggs benedict and the berry french toast, which was a nice sweet dish to follow a really tasty savory one.  Eggs were cooked just right and the hollandaise was very creamy.  The brioche french toast is where it's at though.  Perfectly battered and cooked with just the right amount of sugar.  The berries are fresh and really added a nice tang to the dish.  We eyed just about everyone getting a side of pancakes and kicked ourselves for not leaving enough room so don't forget to try that.  There's plenty of tables but do be prepare for a wait if you're particularly hungry!"
,,,,,"The line for this place was out the door on both days of the weekend when I walked past and so I knew I had to check it out for breakfast. I came here on a Tuesday morning at 9:30am and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 4, and I truly understand why."
,,,,,"I ordered a vegetable omelet and subbed the speciality pancakes for my bread for an extra $2. I was expecting a small side of pancakes given that the omelet was meant to be my main meal, but the pancakes were a full on entree portion as well."
,,,,,"The serving sizes are enormous here, so be sure to come hungry! They have any possible America. breakfast food you can think of, so it's a great place to come with breakfast enthusiasts or picky eaters. Come here if you need a meal to fill you up until dinner time and for some truly tasty pancakes!"
,,,,,"Right off the bat I'm gonna say- USE THE NO WAIT APP!!! This is offered through yelp and can be applied in for you within 10 miles away- I live in Evanston so I know this. It can save you lots of time waiting at the restaurant. Last Saturday we went around prime time (9-11am) and people were being quoted 2 hour waits. With the no wait app, we put our name on the list when we left our house, drove down and then checked in and went to a coffee shop for 30 minutes and our table was ready- so not bad at all! "
,,,,,"The wait is worth is for the berry pancakes- these are so unbelievably fluffy and delicious and cannot be missed. The full stack comes with 5 and can be easily split with a few people in addition to other food.  We also got the Mexican skillet which came with chorizo, veggies, jalapeños etc- was a nice savory contrast to the pancakes."
,,,,,"Further plus, the staff is always very pleasant and helpful despite always being incredible busy. "
,,,,,This is where we bring out of towners and it never disappoints.

,,,,,I'm not normally a big pancakes person... but the reviews had me signing up for the waitlist. This place was AWESOME! 
,,,,,- I got my name on the list through Yelp (party of 1) and got in within 20 minutes
,,,,,- The service was fast!
,,,,,"- My waiter was super friendly (even if I was just eating alone). He checked in regularly, made recommendations in the area, and was very kind. I felt cared for."
,,,,,- Serving size of the pancakes were massive
,,,,,"- Pancakes were fluffy, topping options broad and oh-so-good"
,,,,,I will be back here. Even if I have to wait in line. Worth. It.
,,,,,"This place was my daughter's choice for her birthday breakfast on our short weekend trip to Chicago. It was amazing and the famous Wildberry pancakes didn't disappoint!! They were delicious!! Staff was friendly and attentive. The selection of fall season coffee was excellent! Definitely recommend for breakfast or brunch!! There was a 30-40 minute wait when we got there but who can blame them, they're popular for their delicious pancakes, definitely worth the wait!!"
,,,,,"I feel like each city has to have a brunch place that's super famous and requires you to wait at least 1+ hr. Coming from San Diego, I would say it's the Cottage in La Jolla. And for Chicago, it's Wildberry. My friends and I waited for about 80 minutes for a party of 5. It wasn't too bad since we were able to walk around and go take pictures of the bean while we wait. "
,,,,,"Once seated, I got the red velvet french toast for myself, and was able to the try their famous berry pancakes and eggs Benedicts. Surely the wait was worth it and this place lived up to its hype and did not disappoint me. Everything was delicious and up to my high standards for brunch. Service was also good as our server was attentive and very efficient. Definitely worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Okay folks, Wildberry is worth the hype you have heard from locals, and it certainly was for me! They were packed for breakfast on the Wednesday morning of my visit, but luckily, my co-worker and I only needed to wait around 10 minutes to be seated. While we waited, we looked over the menu. I was immediately hooked on the idea of their corned beef hash and since the waitress mentioned I could up charge my side of pancakes for one of their more specialty ones, I knew I could not go wrong with the signature berry bliss. It was a lot of food, but the leftovers were still very good! The fluffy pancakes were so sweet (so no need to add syrup) and the accompanying fruit was fresh. I loved the berry cream in between the stacks. "
,,,,,"The corned beef was big enough to share among two diners, so I split it into two meals myself. It was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. I don't think I could do canned corned beef again after having such a fresh batch at Wildberry's. The eggs were lofty and I liked mine scrambled since I went with the pancakes over the toast. "
,,,,,"Oh, since the fall menu was out, I also ordered an apple cider. It was warm, tart, and delicious. It's too bad it did not come with free refills. I also never tried it with whip cream, but it was an added layer to this whimsical breakfast treat."
,,,,,"Food was great!  Pancakes, perfect!  Hash bowls with corn beef was great and enough for 2 meals. Will definitely be back again."
,,,,,"One of Chi-Town's best brunch spots! Lines can get long and brutal but a good cup of ""Mint Mocha Latte"" will make time pass by faster. Been there multiple times and I can't stop ordering the ""Mexican Sizzlin' Skillet"". It contains Hash Browns, Cheddar & Jack Cheese, Eggs, Chorizo Sausage, Jalapeños, Avocado, Cilantro & Onions (can't say that's the perfect combination of a brunch platter). Don't miss out on this place!"
,,,,,Always consistently good! Love that you can upgrade your side of pancakes to fancy ones
,,,,,"We came on a Saturday at 12:15 and had to wait around 1.5 hours for a two person table. That being said, I had high expectations for the food! The food was great, I loved the waffle (I saw other people get pancakes and the portion is like 2x as much as the waffle) and the skillet was good too. Service was fantastic! The food also came out really quickly; I overall liked the experience but the wait was insane."
,,,,,Loved the food!   I hated the wait process.  Needs to have an online waitlist process.  No chairs and a little shade is very disrespectful to customers.
,,,,,Great food but extremely long waits on weekends but makes sense it's in the heart of Chicago downtown
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Again on my college audition trip with my son here in Chi-town, I depend a lot on Yelp and this one did not disappoint.  Yes there were closer diners close to the hotel but this foodie I ain't settling for just any diner food.  This place is a chain but it is a good chain restaurant.  The stables such as eggs over easy was done perfectly.  I am an egg snub and they pass my test.  Their famous blueberry pancake is fluffy and moist.  My little one ordered the Nutella crepe and she said it is one of the best one she ever had ( we have had crepes in France so just sayin...) overall it is a bit more than your average diner but worth it."
,,,,,Probably going to have to wait a while but definitely worth the wait. Absolutely delicious and pretty quick to bring out your food despite typically always being packed.
,,,,,"After asking many locals where we could get good breakfast, we decided to take everyone's advice. We came to a Wildberry and it did not disappoint. The prices are a bit high for breakfast, but the portions are very generous. One skillet meal is more than enough for two people. "
,,,,,"We ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles. The meat was tender and had the perfect kick to it. In my opinion It would be better if it had guacamole instead of the sliced avocado,but that's really my only suggestion. It was delicious. The skillet was accompanied by their Berry Bliss pancakes ($2 up-charge).  The pancakes were fluffy and the flavors of the berry mascarpone, combined with the berry syrup and fresh fruit made it all come together. "
,,,,,If you are in the Chicago area I recommend you check out Wildberry.
,,,,,"Best brunch food!!! I've been to multiple locations of Wildberry and it never lets me down! My favorite things to order are vegetarian skillets and the oreo smores pancakes. If you have a sweet tooth, order the oreo smores pancakes I promise you will love them. There is a also a huge variety of drinks (coffees, lattes, teas, juices, etc.) and I love trying out something new every time I go. In my opinion, the menu has pretty much every breakfast/brunch food you could think of which is great for groups since it can cater to various diets and food preferences. "
,,,,,Wildberry is a great spot for a family brunch. This particular location is quite loud and hectic because it is always totally packed but the ambiance is very casual and the amazing food makes it all worth it. It you haven't tried this place out I highly recommend you do!
,,,,,I went here for an early breakfast while visiting Chicago. I think it's going to be a regular spot for me whenever I'm in town. 
,,,,,"I unfortunately can't remember our waitress's name but she was really good, quirky and attentive without being annoying. "
,,,,,"On to my favorite, the food!"
,,,,,"I ordered the corned beef hash, made in house along with two over easy eggs and a berry bliss crepe. It was so good I'm actually thinking about driving back to Chicago right now as I write this review. "
,,,,,"I could eat like this everyday! It was a perfect meal, savory and crunchy from the corned beef; sweet and fluffy from the crepe. I left happy and can't wait to return."
,,,,,"Wildberry never disappoints! Whenever we're in Chicago (from Michigan), we always eat here. Definitely worth the wait."
,,,,,Food was good. Ran out of chicken and biscuits so that is a knock. Coffee was only ok.
,,,,,"Terrific place for breakfast/brunch! Keep in mind the hours before coming in :). Really recommend getting one of the pancake or waffle options. I got the 'Signature Berry Bliss' Belgian Waffles, and it was the perfect level of sweetness to balance out the savoriness of the Skillet I got. Also, this place is located just across the street from Millennium Park (ie the Bean!) ."
,,,,,"Update: you know how you update your review and either raise or lower your score? Well I'm going to leave Wildberry at a five because that's how awesome it is. Actually, take my previous five, add my current five and make it a ten. "
,,,,,"I went back the following day like I said I would and was greeted by the lovely hostesses with ""you're back!"" Of course, I can't get enough. "
,,,,,"So this time I wanted both breakfast and lunch. I ordered the turkey pepper jack panini with sweet potato fries and a ""little berry"" order of the berry bliss pancakes. "
,,,,,"The berry bliss pancakes will change your life and have you second guessing if you should order any other type of pancake. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure all of them are great. But this was is extra extra great. And so was my turkey panini! I was stuffed and couldn't finish it all. "
,,,,,Just wishing I could pack up Wildberry and bring it back to Baltimore with it. 
,,,,,------------------------------------------------
,,,,,"Currently kicking myself for ordering the most basic item on the menu: egg white omelet with pepper jack cheese, plain pancakes and turkey bacon. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great. Actually more than great. Actually so good, I'm planning my visit back before I leave Chicago. "
,,,,,I got there a little bit before closing and the restaurant was packed but I was still seated within 15 minutes. 
,,,,,My server was great as well. Can't wait to come back!

,,,,,"We came here in the morning and had to wait about an hour which feels normal for a place that is supposed to be very popular. The location was great since it was right next to Millennium Park. It allowed us to walk around while waiting. Once we texted that our reservation was next, we came back to the restaurant. The service was great and attentive during our whole meal. However, our food was just okay. The portions were definitely generous and the price was good. Definitely better than a Denny's or IHOP but not the hype of 7,000+ reviews."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Best breakfast/lunch! So fresh, generous portions, skilled waitstaff. Loved this spot pre-pandemic and enjoy frequenting now as well. I love the Mediterranean chicken salad but their breakfast is their claim to fame: cannot go wrong with WB pancakes!"
,,,,,So many options! Wildberry Pancakes is definitely the place to go if you want pancakes. 
,,,,,"Sorting off with non-food related things, the venue was pretty crowded on a Friday morning around 9 AM, but there was no wait. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The menu is a bit overwhelming at first since there are just so many options. There's bound to something you like whether it's on the sweet or the savory side. Service is also great. The staff is friendly and your food comes out fairly quickly."
,,,,,"I decided to order a seasonal special, the pork belly french toast. I also got a hazelnut almond milk latte and a small side of the ""Signature Berry Bliss"" pancakes. Overall, the food was very solid and enjoyable, but nothing mind blowing. For being a seasonal special, my french toast was somewhat underwhelming. It was simply french toast with syrup topped with small pieces of pork belly. The pancakes were also not very special with the main driver of the dish being the sauces. All this being said, the food was very good and portions were large. You will leave Wildberry feeling full."
,,,,,I went here when visiting ChiTown a week ago and I really liked their food and service! I like the fact that the staff is really cautious and safe and make sure their employees and customers are very well taken care of off. 
,,,,,Def going back when I visit Chicago again!
,,,,,One of my favorite breakfast in Chicago.  They always have a line so go early to avoid it! Yelp waitlist also helps.  Food here is amazing and fantastic service.  I ordered the brisket hash and it felt like enough for 2 person.  Their signature blueberry pancake is off the hook.  Overall great experience and throughly enjoy it the two times I was in chicago
,,,,,"The staff is quick and efficient about moving people in and out, to accommodate as many guests as possible. Love the lattes and the pancakes. You'll have more than enough to eat!"
,,,,,The best breakfast food around. Love it. Would highly recommend it because of the variety and tasty options. The crepes are fantastic snd the French toast delicious.
,,,,,"Decent Breakfast, it was pretty busy during this visit, i think the visit would have been a lot better if it wasn't so packed inside, it was so loud it was hard to have conversations. the staff was kind and the food while having very large portions, it was just too much to eat."

,,,,,It is my first time to visit this restaurant though I walked pass it many times.
,,,,,Here are pros and cons for this restaurant:
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,"1. It is spacious, good for solo or group dining."
,,,,,2. It is near Millennium Park and public transportation stations.
,,,,,3. There are many breakfast choices no matter it is on the sweet side or savory side.  I chose the signature berry bliss pancake and found it is too sweet for me.  But it is presentation is interesting.  It is creative to give the pancake a touch of yogurt.  The honey toffee nut latte is also pretty sweet.
,,,,,4. Waitresses and waters are polite and cheerful
,,,,,5. There is cash back on yelp.
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,The portion is very big
,,,,,WOW WOW WOW - The hype is real. I went to have breakfast here with my family for my birthday.
,,,,,"All I will say is, you must come and have breakfast/brunch here when in Chicago. "
,,,,,"The location is perfect, the service is AWESOME all across the board."
,,,,,The food is to die for! They have everything under the sun and for very reasonable prices. 
,,,,,The wait is long however you can out your name down through the yelp app beforehand and then you will be notified what time you should go and check in. They have a little coffee shop inside where you can grab a drink while you wait to be called.
,,,,,"The food and entire experience was just fantastic. We went to see the famous bean while we waited to be called, it is just up the street. "
,,,,,"The pancakes were all amazing, the coffee was excellent  - try the iced mocha or the hot coconut mocha! The skillets are all to do - the Denver , the Chilaquiles and Mexican scramble with chorizo - omgggg out of this world! I wish they had one here in LA."
,,,,,This food was so good and the price was affordable. I enjoyed Wildberry and will be back.

,,,,,Me and a fiend had take 
,,,,, was fresh and large portion sizes. The French toast was cooked perfectly and the butcher block skillet was done right! We enjoyed our meal and will be back.
,,,,,Food was beyond amazing and service and speed of service is second to none. Can't wait to get back into town and head back to Wildberry!!
,,,,,I really enjoyed the pancakes. I'd eat here everyday
,,,,,"It doesn't matter how long the wait is, you wait. It's worth it. "
,,,,,"Some friends and I were on a girls trip and obviously wanted to find a good brunch place, we found it.  Their gluten free menu was huge!  I wanted to try everything. But instead of blowing all my money on brunch my friend and I decided to split our food so we could try more stuff! "
,,,,,"So we tried the eggs Benedict with a side of hashbrowns, the Napa Valley omelette, and an order of gluten free, buttermilk pancakes with their cinnamon, pecan butter.  And oh man was it delicious!! Everything was amazing but my favorites were definitely the omelette and the pancakes. "
,,,,,"The Napa Valley omelette had figs in it.  Figs!! I didn't know how good figs, cheese, and eggs could be until I had this omelette.  And the pancakes were just amazing.  It was way to much food for the two of us, but we had zero regrets."
,,,,,"This is a must each visit to Chicago, the wait is long but it gives us time to shop near by and walk the park to work an appetite. But the food is worth the wait."
,,,,,"Tried the butchers block, which was full of meat"
,,,,,this was ok
,,,,,ended up taking leftovers home 
,,,,,i feel like it tasted better later
,,,,,we added a side of specialty pancakes for +$2 or something
,,,,,I'm not the biggest fan of pancakes (I usually prefer savory breakfast foods)
,,,,,but they were damn good here
,,,,,The signature berry bliss pancakes were SO GOOD!
,,,,,I don't normally like pancakes but these were y u m m
,,,,,I'm sure the waffles would be amazing as well
,,,,,it's a plus that you can add yourself to the waitlist on yelp to minimize your wait time too!
,,,,,"There was a two hour wait but the food was delicious. They still have a lot of precautions with covid, which I appreciate. The portions are gigantic so unless you have a huge appetite, you're better off splitting a meal with someone. Plenty of vegetarian options as well!"
,,,,,"Hate to give a mediocre review during COVID restrictions, I really do... but it would've been lower if that wasn't an issue. I'm at a loss at what is so special about this place-- look how unappetizing my eggs/hash browns/bacon was? "
,,,,,"The hash browns are definitely frozen- they tasted watery, bacon was cooked uneven , scrambled eggs are flat and thin as paper! It tasted like it looked-- blah. "
,,,,,"The pancakes were ok, but my strawberries looked old and mushy. "
,,,,,"Service was subpar - there on 9/10 @9:30 K_____ was my server(don't want to put your full name) got my paper cup coffee and no side of sugar- a full 5-7 minutes went by before she emerged -- ""can I have some sugar?"" "
,,,,,"5 more minutes later she brought some sugar. Coffee was cold by now- couldn't find her to asked for a fresh cup. You can see how busy it was. Can't we train her better to bring this with her "" in case"" someone wants sugar. "
,,,,,This was repeated with the food- had to wait and wait for hot sauce because she disappeared again. 
,,,,,Maybe a perfect storm of bad food/service-- but not over anxious to give it another try. Sorry
,,,,,"Loved the atmosphere. The food was good. Only complaint is I ordered pumpkin spice pancakes-- Tasted nothing like pumpkin spice. Not one bit. Other than that, food was good. Service was prompt."
,,,,,"My buddy from Florida was visiting Chicago and he wanted to do some touristy things (Cloud Gate and the Art Institute) in Chicago when it was below 0 degrees. So since I have never been to this location before because I am aware of the ridiculous wait times, I figured it is a good time to go when it's ridiculously cold out. My hometown is near the Libertyville location so I have been graced with the amazingness of Wildberry's before. "
,,,,,"We arrived there around 8:30am on a Sunday morning. Luckily for us or was only a 10 minute wait when it is typically at least an hour! Funny thing for the people that came in after us is that wait time jumped up to 30 minutes by the time we were seated. I cannot make this up, fair warning that Wildberry's has ridiculously long wait times."
,,,,,"I ordered a Vanilla Latte from the Barista as I was very hungover and needed the caffeine and then we were seated. They serve Intelligentsia coffee (THE BEST)! The place is actually pretty big, but the spaces are very small. Like expect to be able to eavesdrop on the people next to you, make new friends, and be nice enough that they might even allow you to take a bite of their meal! Kidding! "
,,,,,"I ordered Denver Skillet with a side of Wheat Toast, which is one of my go-to's. Skillets, Omelettes, Pancakes, and French Toast are all delicious and you really can't go wrong. Fair warning the portion sizes are humongous and Wildberry's is one of the best bang for your bucks in Chicago!"
,,,,,Service was adequate. The only complaint I have is the long wait times. So this review is really 4.5 stars. Go to Wildberry's!

,,,,,"Long waits for mediocre food, rushed service, and chaotic environment. I don't get the appeal."
,,,,,"Came here for a Sunday brunch and waited for nearly 2 hours before we were able to be seated, as do most people! Overall, the pancakes were delicious but the skillets left much to be desired. We ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles skillet, the Garden skillet, and a side of wildberry and blueberry pancakes. The Barbacoa was flavorful, but some bites were EXTREMELY spicy. They may have unevenly spread the spices and it became a bit unbearable to eat without taking water breaks. The Garden skillet, however, was entirely opposite. I'm talking NO spices what so ever. It left me extremely confused... they were sautéed veggies with an egg on top. That's quite literally it. It was as bland as you could get. Do not recommend!"
,,,,,"As far as pancakes, they were both rich, creamy, and not overpoweringly sweet. Great choices. There's a reason the restaurants name isn't Wildberry Skillets, so choose accordingly..."
,,,,,"I think Wildberry gets a lot of hype because of its central location near Millenium Park. While the food was good, I'm not sure if it was worth the 45 minute wait."
,,,,,"We got the Slow Roast Brisket Hash (brisket, roasted red peppers, onions, and sausage gravy served with two eggs on a bed of potatoes and a side of toast) and the Mexicana Sizzlin' Skillet (hashbrowns, cheddar & peppejack cheese, two eggs, chorizo sausage, roasted jalapenos, avocado, cilantro, and onions). "
,,,,,"The skillet came with a side of pancakes, so we substituted for a specialty pancake for an extra $2. The Signature Berry Bliss pancakes (fresh berries, jam, and marscapone cheese) was so worth it! "
,,,,,"We weren't too thrilled with the brisket hash, but the skillet was really, really good."
,,,,,"For coffee, we got the Honey Toffee Nut Latte and Vanilla Berry Latte. Both were too sweet for our liking, and they served them to us in paper cups so there was no latte art. I'd recommend skipping the fancy lattes and just going for regular drip coffee here."
,,,,,"Over 5,700 reviews and almost a perfect Yelp score, so of course I had to see what the hype was all about. They started off on the right foot by having the capability to be added to the waitlist via Yelp and being able to track the position on the list.  I had a 45 minute wait on the app. We got there early and the place was packed.  There is a roped off wait area in the back where you could wait for you table indoors. When we got to the restaurant they were giving out 2 hour wait times to walk-ins like they were Oprah. You get a 2 hour wait, You get a 2 hour wait, and you get a 2 hour wait. There is metered street parking right around the corner from the restaurant. "
,,,,,"The staff there was very friendly. They were very apologetic about the wait and very attentive to my group's needs. The food was not only picture perfect, but also delicious. There are so many good sounding options to choose from and I got the strawberry almond french toast, bacon and corned beef hash. MMMMMM!!! My entire group loved their meal. The restaurant does not rest on its laurels and definitely lives up to all of its hype. I enjoyed eating here on my brief trip to Chicago."
,,,,,"This is from our June 2021 visit....our 30min wait became 1 hr,  but guess w/this location being in downtownn chicago and on a beautiful sat am, it's not shocking. since it was 1130am, we decided on lunch with order being burger, tuscan panini & a buffalo wrap. all went well.........  server was proficient.  would visit again,"
,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes was recommended to me by multiple people so I knew I had to try! We signed up to get on their wait list and were seated in 45 minutes on a Saturday late morning. Instead of waiting outside and getting hangry, we decided to spend that time hanging around the bean, which was very close - so I suggest doing that if you have a long wait!"
,,,,,"I shared the Mexicana skillet served with a side of""signature berry bliss"" pancakes! I absolutely loved the Mexicana skillet - the saltiness of the chorizo and spicy/freshness of jalapeños were really good with the hash browns, which were on the blander side. Having the eggs cooked over easy was the right move because the yolk running through all the components in the skillet really made this dish! "
,,,,,"The berry bliss pancakes on the other hand, were a little disappointing. I thought the pancakes were a bit tough and I didn't like the drizzle on top. It tasted too tangy for me. "
,,,,,"Overall, my friends had a great experience at Wildberry. The staff was very friendly, food was great, and portions were HUGE. Come hungry!"
,,,,,"Went straight to Wildberry after we landed in Chicago for brunch and it did not disappoint. The wait at this location is ridiculous, over an hour for a table for four - but to be fair, it was Thanksgiving day and it's quite close to the parade."
,,,,,"The shop was packed with people when we arrived, it was freezing outside so many patrons (us includes) opted for waiting inside the store - coming from Minneapolis, it's interesting to see that Chicagoans are still SO!NICE! and kind. Staffs were so friendly and helpful, all that makes the long wait more bearable. "
,,,,,"We ordered 3 dishes to share for four people because, again American serving sizes are ridiculous. We got the signature berry bliss pancakes, chocolate strawberry waffles and Los Altos Benedict. "
,,,,,* Waffle is crispy and not too thick. The choc chips got all melty on the warm waffles and fresh strawberries balance out the sweetness. I like this best! 
,,,,,"* Los Altos benedict was okay, the eggs and sauce were standard, hashbrown was delicious! but the minced sausage that comes with it is a little sour.. The english muffin under neath the egg also got soggy and too chewy"
,,,,,"* Berry bliss pancakes were just okay, I like the flavor combo: the sauce and fresh berries. But the pancakes are too thick and not fluffy enough for my liking. "
,,,,,* Hot chocolate was pretty good! 
,,,,,"Overall a pleasant experience, I'd come back if I ever visit Chicago again:)"
,,,,,Yum! I I ordered the two eggs any style with hash browns and a short stack of buttermilk pancakes. These were the fluffiest pancakes I have ever had! Hash browns were crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. A great breakfast/brunch spot. I recommend making a reservation beforehand.
,,,,,The breakfast was a 10! The omelettes are fresh and pancakes are fluffy and light. The service is top notch as well. I am on vacation from New Orleans and highly recommend having breakfast here; it's worth the wait!
,,,,,"Great food, great service, and large portions! I love wildberry! It's one of my favorite brunch spots. The wait is always ridiculously long but worth the wait. I love their wildberry pancakes. Definitely recommend!"

,,,,,My all time favorite breakfast and brunch spot. I've dined in at 2 different locations both were great.
,,,,,Nice little spot if you want to try different types of pancakes with a twist. I had the cinnamon swirl pancakes which were a bit too sweet but not bad.
,,,,,"While the line looked daunting, we ended up being seated 15 minutes before the earliest we were told to expect to be seated. We sat outside with our pup and had fantastic service. The food was also remarkable!"
,,,,,"The prices very affordable, the food was great (and alot) ,lastly service was quick and efficient.."
,,,,,Popular basic brunch place. Recommend to go early to avoid the wait times. Lots of menu options and all are solid choices.
,,,,,Pandemic review.  4.5 stars. 
,,,,,"Over the last couple of months, I have made it here twice. The outside dining was pleasant and everything seemed to be kept sanitary, maybe the tables could have been a little further apart. Today the inside was open, the tables were spaced very well apart, things were being kept sanitary, and it was nice and cool inside. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed their fluffy, generous omelettes (The Rutherford and a bacon and cheese omelet), nicely cooked pancakes (have had the berry pancakes, the chocolate chip, and the plain buttermilk, plainer but still very tasty), nice thick perfectly cooked bacon, and perfect crispy hash browns. It was nice to be able to get in there and lot have to stand in a long line due to a lot less tourists around here, nice for me, but probably not as nice for them. Will probably return and try something else."
,,,,,Wildberry's has several locations in Chicago and this was super close to Millennium Park. Definitely a place for diabeetus overload ;) 
,,,,,I ordered the Red Velvet French Toast and it was an absolute dream. Very sugary and has cream cheese frosting drizzled all over. Don't come here if you already had your sugar intake of the day. It did feel more like a cake roll than French toast though. It's also rather sweet enough already without the extra syrup.
,,,,,"I really hate to give a bad review for this place. I ordered pickup. My food was well-packed and ready when I got there. The staff was great. HOWEVER, my churro French toast was COATED in SALT. This is a very terrible mistake and could have ended very badly for someone who'd actually eaten the entire meal. The portions of food are large and well worth the money. My family enjoyed all of their meals. It was just mine that was coated in salt. I probably would try this place again, but I certainly would NOT get the churro French toast."
,,,,,SO MUCH FOOD.
,,,,,Make sure to have an empty stomach and ample time because the line gets crazy.
,,,,,I had friends visit Chicago so we decided to check this place out. It's located in prime location of Downtown Chicago and the view of the city along Michigan Ave is stunning. 
,,,,,"The wait was around 1.5 hours, probably because it was a Sunday morning. Make sure to book a reservation or have plenty of time because I'm sure you won't be able to walk in."
,,,,,"Each of us ordered not knowing the portion and quickly enough, our table overflowed with food. Everything tasted amazing, but couldn't finish everything. "
,,,,,The service was good overall and the restaurant was very lively with many locals and tourists.
,,,,,Front rude staff. If you want punishment for you and your family to wait to get in. And then receive wrong orders. This place is for you.
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"So....this place has a ton of hype! The lines are honestly hours long!! Luckily, they have waitlist on yelp, so we were able to get our names down way before actually showing up. "
,,,,,"The wait staff was friendly and for as busy as they were, pretty attentive. The food was good but the portions size was enormous so, I would recommend splitting with another person. "
,,,,,"All in all, the breakfast was good but I wouldn't wait there in line for hours like some people were."
,,,,,"This place is amazing!  The portions are huge.  I had the 2 egg breakfast with over medium eggs, hash browns, and patty sausage and paid the couple extra bucks to get the signature berry pancakes.  It was all amazing!  I will be sure to bookmark this spot to come again when back to Chicago."
,,,,,"Wildberry is amazing! The best brunch place in town. Unless you plan to go early, early morning, you can expect a 60-90 minute, especially on weekends; but let me say, the wait it SO, SO worth it! Take advantage of the waitlist feature on Yelp and be sure to arrive on time or your table will be given away within 5 minutes. The waitlist does close around 1:45-2:00"
,,,,,"While waiting, if it's nice out, Millennium Park is right across the street, so it's nice way to kill time at the Bean or the Fountain if you're new in town. Taking a stroll down Michigan can kill the time too. They also have a cafe and coffee bar near the entrance where you can order a drink (no alcohol) while waiting. Go over the menu while waiting so you have an idea what to order. Wait is not that bad on weekdays. "
,,,,,"On to the food... best brunch I've had in a while. Portions are amazing, price is worth it, the menu is extensive, I honestly could not make my mind up so I ended up going a little overboard (no regrets) and packed the rest to go. We ordered the butcher block skillet which was beyond filling - a lot of meat and hash browns. So good! And the Oreo-s'mores pancakes immediately caught my attention - sweet, rich and, soft. I ended up having to pack the chicken and waffle and eating it at home. The waffle was infused with jalapeños and bacon. Delicious. "
,,,,,"If you order a drink off the espresso and mocha menu, I think they throw in a coffee from the bar later. My friend substituted it for a fresh lemonade. "
,,,,,"Hats off to the servers. They were friendly, nice, accommodating, and had the best suggestions. Our server was very sweet and was able to substitute and add things to our dishes. "
,,,,,"Overall, an amazing experience. Slightly loud because it's usually at full capacity, but a great atmosphere. Highly and strongly recommend!"
,,,,,I remembered the pancakes from when I went to the suburb location awhile ago. Finally came to this downtown location... best pancakes ever. Good coffee drinks. Great service. There might be a wait... just eat here it's worth it.
,,,,,Wildberry benefits greatly from having a prime location in Chicago. Across the street from Millennium Park on Randolph is tough to beat. This place is always jammed packed with tourist. 
,,,,,"I worked in the same building as Wildberry for 6 years and was a regular because of the convenience. I've tried just about every item on the menu. To avoid the long wait, we'd often place to-go orders."
,,,,,"While I'd never had a bad meal, I think Wildberry is on par with just about any slightly above average breakfast restaurant. I guess it depends on what you like. I'm not a big fan of Yolk or The Bongo Room. Wildberry is on the same plane."
,,,,,I actually prefer the lunch options over breakfast. The burger is seraphic when not overcooked. The havarti cheese and onion jam are the perfect accompaniment. 
,,,,,"Long story short. .. Wildberry is fine, but there are better options in the area and countless more if you explore other neighborhoods."
,,,,,This spot did not disappoint! I would say the pancakes and the skillets was right on point.
,,,,,I went there for breakfast and ordered a Belgium waffle but it was very dry and hard. Other food that I tried was fine. Very good location and service.
,,,,,"Food was super interesting. It's breakfast but Tex-mexy? Like you can order pancakes or chilaquiles (what me and my coworker did when we went) so that kind of confused me, I wasn't expecting it. I enjoyed my breakfast sweets and them their chicken dinner breakfast but I don't necessarily need to go back. I'd recommend calling ahead/making a resi since it's right downtown and is ALWAYS crazy packed."
,,,,,"I was disappointed they don't take reservations but the heavy staff to manage the long line explained..  The wait was less than what they estimated so that was a plus.  The service was less than average but I still tipped.  While the food portions were really good,  my omelet and hash browns  were not cooked throughly so the only food I  thoroughly enjoyed was the wild berry pancakes.  Since that has  been my experience the 2 times I've visited,  I think it's contributed to serving food quickly to keep crowd moving but will definitely request they cook my food longer next time."
,,,,,Soooo like the waiting list was like 2 and half hours. 
,,,,,"We were staying at the Sheraton for the weekend and were in the mood to walk around and tour our city, you can put yourself on the waiting list and they do text you when your table is almost ready so its best to stay within close proximity. "
,,,,,The food was great but not like abnormally amazing... on the other hand the portions are fairly large so you can share a few bites without feeling selfish. I think almost every place downtown is hyped to the max for no reason at all. Its a nice experience tho. 
,,,,,we had the Mexicana Sizzlin' Skillet with chicken and the Wildberry signature berry bliss ( I enjoyed it ) 
,,,,,I also went a second time around fall and had their Caramel apple pecan pancakes. Those were superb. 
,,,,,Hopefully they'll consider opening a different location with an actual parking lot that would be amazing.

,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe delivers from beginning to end. We were fortunate to visit this place for breakfast and enjoyed every minute of it. Their berry bliss crepes were amazing and the customer service received from our waitress was incredible. Prices were more than competition from other nearby hotels and restaurants, and portion sizes were more than generous. We definitely recommend this place for breakfast due to its wide variety of options and excellent attention to detail. We hope to be back in the near future."
,,,,,"Worse experience in my life. We were in line waiting to be seated and I was holding my 2 months old baby, it was extremely hot outside and they did not let me wait inside to protect my crying baby from the heat. I won't recommend this place to anyone. There is a lot of great restaurants in Chicago but this one is in the bottom of the worse restaurants. Beyond horrible management and staff."
,,,,,I found Wildberry on Yelp and was pretty skeptical about the great reviews. But wow was I impressed. 
,,,,,Here's the good:
,,,,,- Service. Fast and efficient. Funny. Friendly. They know exactly when to be there and when to give you your own time. 
,,,,,- The food. So. Much. Food. You could share one entree and still be too full to finish. I can't get over the portion sizes. So. Much. Food. And for such a reasonable price. 
,,,,,"- The menu. The variety. So many different options to please any palate. Whether you want a lighter breakfast, dessert for breakfast, or a bit of spice, they have it all. "
,,,,,"- The atmosphere. Hanging light fixtures, glass windows, stone walls, TVs. So bright, inviting, and picture worthy. "
,,,,,The bad? I can't think of any.
,,,,,"From the jokes and personable staff members to the amazing food, I could totally justify coming here for breakfast every day of my visits to Chicago."
,,,,,"I would definitely recommend.....pic is of the Butcher Block Skillet and Pancakes....I only made through a 3rd of it before I had to tap out....OMG, sooooo gooodddd!!!!"
,,,,,My husband loves dessert and breakfast so this place was perfect for that. We were promptly seated and I ordered the chai latte and los alto eggs benedick. I really love that I could sub out hash browns for fruit with this meal. Each bite was really packed with flavor. It was a huge portion I could barely finish. My husband got the berry bliss pancakes and they were everything he wanted. I tried a bite and I really enjoyed the texture of the pancakes. Lack of star because they rushed us through our meal and out the door. It was so rushed they were cleaning the table while I was attempting to put my jacket on still. I would come back for the yummy food though.
,,,,,Amazing breakfast spot. Blueberry pancakes are the best I've ever eaten. I would highly recommend this spot for amazing traditional breakfast. Only negative was they do not serve alcohol. We pre-gamed with mimosas
,,,,,"The best pancake I've eaten in life! The place is crowded, so it's good have a reservation. However, if you don't have one, it totally worth it waiting for your table."
,,,,,"We came here at the beginning of the year when COVID restrictions were still tight. The wait staff did an amazing job with somewhat quick seating (there was a line, but when is there not?), the food came out quickly and was delish (Belgian Waffle, breakfast nachos, and pancakes!!). The portions are pretty big so you could easily share, main dishes come with a side of pancakes, waffle, toast, etc. makes it easier to share! I HIGHLY recommend their iced coffees, I've had the turtle and the mocha both visits -- very good and makes you want to take one to walk around!"
,,,,,"This place is one of the reasons I check flights to Chicago every so often, I debate coming here for a day just to have breakfast. It's one of my favorite breakfast places ever! It really is delicious and fresh. The servers are SO nice, seriously, it really is overall amazing."
,,,,,"My friends and I got the butcher block, theres some kind of deal where it comes with a small side of pancakes and that is PERFECT because honestly the pancakes are what you want here."
,,,,,"The butcher block was serious. So delicious, I have never had so much of an epic scramble of meats, eggs, potatoes, and cheese. They have others, just go with what you personally like."
,,,,,"I'm not a fan of berry flavored things for the most part, I try to avoid them because I prefer fresh, but the Berry Pancakes here were BEYOND DELICIOUS. Idk what it is, but you must get these when you come. It doesn't have that overly sugary artificial fake taste, it was rich, just a bit creamy, and overall perfect flavor combo. I am obsessed."
,,,,,"My friend got the oreo pancakes, I can't speak for those, they did look great and they said it tasted great."
,,,,,I love Wildberrys and miss it so much! I really hope I can make it sometime soon.
,,,,,"Possibly one of the best breakfast places on the planet!!! Pancakes stacked so high you can't see the person across the table, amazing specialty coffees (we had almond joy and mint chocolate) and the skillets were ridiculously good!! Well worth the 2hr wait. The staff was super friendly and went out of their way to celebrate my best friends birthday! Probably the best carb loading I've ever had before a marathon!! Love Chicago! And Love Wildberry Pancakes!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,The food was mediocre at best. Got a Denver skillet and the hash browns were burnt and flavor was the worst I have ever had. My daughter ordered pancakes and they gave her enough to feed 3 people but she is 11 and didn't need all of that. Our bill was $70 for four people. Disappointed considering all the positive reviews.
,,,,,The wait was horrible. Didn't even get a chance to dine in and couldn't make reservations.
,,,,,"Great food. Good prices with large portions. I suggest if you order the omelet to pay the up charge and get the pancakes instead of the toast. That way you get the best of the two worlds. I ordered the Wild Mushroom & Prosciutto Omelet, it was amazing. Large enough to share. The waffles look to die for, next time."
,,,,,Best place near Millennium Park for breakfast.  Everything I have tried is amazing.  The pancakes in all variations are unique and delicious.
,,,,,Once in a lifetime breakfast experience!! This place is worth the wait!! I am visiting from San Diego and had heard great things about this place! The server Annette was very attentive and accommodating throughout the entire service and was very knowledgeable about the entire menu! 
,,,,,"Substitutions were welcomed and everything came out quickly and perfectly cooked. We were a large part of 9 and the manager Nino made sure no matter how busy and backed up the place was our service was valued. That's what I loved! We were not rushed, we were more than taken care of and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area regardless of the wait! "
,,,,,Food notes: (Portions are BIG)
,,,,,Berry blitz pancakes : 10/10 because there was strawberry yogurt in between each layer the on top of that you got a taste of fresh berries too!
,,,,,Biscuits & gravy: 10/10 because the ratio of biscuits to gravy was JUST right! They poured the gravy over at the right time because nothing was soggy and it truly tasted like grandmas fluffy biscuits made at home!!
,,,,,Grand daddy (senior plate) + Side of ham was portioned just right: 10/10 the eggs were fluffy with a good amount of cheddar cheese melted on top.
,,,,,The timing the food was impressive as everything was brought together and fast considering how busy this place was......and on top of that we ALL got our foods made with zero mistakes regardless of the number of substitutions we all made! Their attention to detail blew my mind with the number of people in our party!
,,,,,Love love love!!!
,,,,,This place blew me away....message me on insta @neeks93 if you want any more detail this bodybuilder and friends are more than impressed
,,,,,Watch me on NBC Jan 3rd (The Titan Games) I'm one of the  Rock's 64 competitors!
,,,,,I can't even explain how amazing their food here was!!! Their servings are pretty huge too. One meal can probably feed two. Their corn beef hash were delicious and the blueberry danish pancakes were to die for!
,,,,,Came here with my husband at around 11am on a Saturday. BEFORE YOU GO ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY ADD YOURSELF ONTO THEIR YELP WAITLIST!!! The wait here is insane and ranges between 80-110 minutes. Treat yourself by resting up in your hotel room for a little longer before heading out to wait in the cold for brunch. After getting our confirmation text that our table was ready we waited another 10 minutes inside before we were officially seated. 
,,,,,Our server was extremely attentive and super prompt about filling out waters. It did seem that waters were filled much quicker than coffee. We ordered the Mexicana Skillet with an upgrade to the banana coconut cream pancake as well as a Berry Bliss Pancake order. There is a extra charge for subbing a signature pancake for the original pancakes in the skillets but its 100% worth it for just $2.00. HOT TIP: When we ordered our Berry Bliss Pancake our server asked if we wanted 2 or 5. They do smaller orders! The original on the menu is $14 and 2 was half the price of that. Honestly it's still pricey for pancakes but way worth it since we no longer had to pack food home. 
,,,,,The food here is all delicious. My husband and I both loved the Mexicana skillet as well as the Berry Bliss pancake. The Banana Cream pancake was also great but the Berry Bliss stole the show.
,,,,,Overall great location with excellent food!
,,,,,The food was delicious! The service was great! There is a long wait to get in so make sure to plan for that when trying out this restaurant.
,,,,,Is this the best breakfast type spot in Chicago? It's very good. Is it one of my favorites? Yes.
,,,,,This place is a VERY populated location as you may know by the surrounded area but expect to wait.. or use a waitlist feature. The wait is looooooooong.
,,,,,"I can't quite remember what I had but I did remember I had a positive experience. I usually stick to eggs benedicts or skillets so that's probably what I would've gotten anyways. It was rather fresh, delightful, and good portion."
,,,,,Cute spot. Really popular! Definitely expect to wait to be seated at least 30 min or more.

,,,,,"I came here with a friend that was visiting Chicago for a day. Her hotel was right across the street and it was freezing cold, so we figured we'd go there to minimize walking in the cold. "
,,,,,"We arrived there at around 12:30pm and the place was packed. It was a Friday though and a lunch rush, so I wasn't surprised at all. There was about a 10-15 minute wait. The waiting area is pretty small, people were standing everywhere, but they were seating people quickly, so it wasn't as bad. "
,,,,,"When we finally got seated, our waiter automatically gave us recommendations since it was both our first time there. It seems like the pancakes are the most popular dish here, so we figured we'd give them a try. Unfortunately, my friend is very picky with food. She's allergic to almost everything, so we just opted for plain pancakes with a side of fruit. They were actually really really good. The food came out really quick too, even though it was a lunch rush. "
,,,,,This place seems to have a lot of potential and the menu is really appetizing. I'll be coming back here and trying out a bunch of different stuff though.
,,,,,"The food is good but the servers are always stretched way too thin. For example, last time I went, the server brought out my food and asked if we would like any hot sauce or ketchup. We said yes, and it took 15-20 minutes before it came. I don't blame the specific waiter, I just think they need to increase their waitstaff-to-customers ratio."
,,,,,Such a great spot in the city to grab breakfast. 
,,,,,"It fills up pretty quickly, not sure what that will be like post-Covid times but prior I would say get here early in the AM. "
,,,,,Great good. Delicious coffee. Great location.
,,,,,"We came here for a lovely breakfast and had an amazing time. I got the special berry bliss pancakes and americano. My cousin got the butchers block skillet. The pancakes and the skillet were really good and both are great for the price, I'll be coming back here to try their other things on their menu. So glad we came here on the first day of the years and had a great time!"
,,,,,"Lovely pancakes, enjoyed them so much got the Special berry bliss pancakes. Presentation was amazing would visit again"
,,,,,"Great spot, some of the best breakfast food i've had! Must visit whenever you're in Chicago. Quick service, food arrived fresh, and service there is great."
,,,,,"Food was soooo good and the staff super friendly! First Breakfast in Chicago, definitely a hit! Highly recommend this place! It is right across from Millennium Park too, so the location couldn't have been more perfect!"
,,,,,"This place is worth seeking out. Excellent breakfast  menu options and outside seating across from a lovely park (Maggie Daley Park, I think.) - great service too. About $25-$30 pp for breakfast, depending on what you order - a bit above average for the area I think."
,,,,,"Hey Hi Hello! This place right here is classic breakfast but on another level of delicious. I seriously cannot explain just how perfect this breakfast was by God's grace. It was everything you want. I ordered a corned beef hash eggs benedict with a side of Oreo pancakes. Yes, it was a lot of food. But I split it with a friend so we didn't have too much leftover. Thank God! The flavors were exactly what you expect but better haha if that makes sense. Seriously recommend! Wildberry Pancakes and cafe, you've been stomach verified!"
,,,,,This is our top three weekend brunch places in downtown Chicago. Our 3 yr old has the menu memorized. We LOVE the signature beery bliss pancakes and mexicana skillet
,,,,,The food and service were great!!! I had the wild mushroom and prosciutto omelet with the cinnamon roll pancakes.
,,,,,I will be back.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,We had a great meal and great service.  The skillets provide large portions.  Pancakes are very fluffy and tasty. Espresso and hot chocolate were very god as well.  Would highly recommend.
,,,,,Food is always amazing and service is great! A local fav! My husband and I always share these delicious pancakes!
,,,,,This is a must for our annual trip to Chicago and it never disappoints. I definitely recommend trying. I also love the amount of Gluten Free options. The skillets and pancakes are a must.
,,,,,"Wildberry is one of our favs and we go everytime we are in Chicago. Unique items, big portions and something for everyone. Breakfast is our first choice when we dine there but their wraps and salads are delicious too. Mouth watering pancakes & french toasts, skillets, yummy preserves for toast and fresh squeezed OJ. Always worth any wait time, love it and always recommend it to everyone! Excellent kids menu with fun choices. Service is always top notch too."
,,,,,"One of my go to spots in the city. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I come back and get something different each time and I'm always more and more impressed. Definitely worth the long wait times! Their coffee is also good!! Strong and tasty! I've tried literally every one. If you can't decide between French toast or pancakes, GET BOTH! The service is also great. Come here at least once a week."
,,,,,"It's only been a few days, but already craving Wildberry's sweet and savory breakfast options. Open one up in California already! "
,,,,,"Came here super early on Friday morning to avoid the long lines and glad we did. We were seated quickly and primarily were sitting with a few business workers who didn't bother us. When I looked up the wait time for the next day/Saturday, since we wanted to go again, the wait times were nearing the 2 hour mark. "
,,,,,"Honestly, you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. I'm not a pancake person, but they are known for their signature berry bliss pancakes. I wanted to try it, so I ordered it and modified the order for French toast instead. The toppings were delicious!"
,,,,,"The barbacoa chilaquiles was also delicious! It may be underrated on the menu, but omg! I could crave that and/or eat it again. The flavors had a nice kick to it. "
,,,,,"Lastly, you can't go wrong with any of the Benedict's either. The portions are huge and decently priced. I enjoyed that they came with hash browns as well."
,,,,,Breakfast here definitely started our day off right.
,,,,,Enjoy :)
,,,,,Literally the BEST breakfast place. You cannot go wrong with any of the pancakes or skillets
,,,,,I visited Chicago for a week and literally went to this place for breakfast/brunch almost every day. I couldn't get enough of their French toast.
,,,,,Pancakes and waffles are so good here.
,,,,,The waits are long for dine-in so I prefer picking up and the food is just as good!!
,,,,,"Excellent comfort breakfast, glad I live close by."
,,,,,"The place is spotless and adheres to Covid with tables spaced out. Had to join the wait list even at 9 am. It was packed! We had a 30 min wait. But we actually got sat down sooner. The process is very organized and well managed. Friendly service and attentive. Lots of menus options. Good portion sizes on food. If your looking for something unique and sweet definitely go for the pancakes or french toast. For me, too sweet... my dessert for the week."

,,,,,"Fast and friendly service!! Pancakes, BLT, eggs, sausage, fresh juice...everything was delicious!!!"
,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes and Café was on my bookmarks for the longest time. When I finally went to Chicago, I took it as my opportunity to go, and not only that, but to go early. I had heard horror stories about the wait."
,,,,,"Turns out - what wait? We waited ten minutes tops. Then again, it may have been the time or even the season. I went after the polar vortex around 8 or 9 in the morning."
,,,,,"For those who decide to use the NoWait app, know that it's no more. It integrated with Yelp, and well, given that there was virtually no wait when we went, I ended up not needing it period."
,,,,,"Moving onwards - I think this is a chain. A few of them popped up when I searched, but for those who are geography challenged, know this is the one across the street from Millennium Park."
,,,,,"That said, we waited, we were sat, and we had a very peppy waitress. The place is loud, full of life, and they really are nice overall. The waitress we had was very welcoming and gave us recommendations."
,,,,,"Had a cappuccino that was okay. Nothing out of this world. Cannot comment on the hot chocolate ordered. Also, ordered the signature berry pancakes. Get these! Although if you don't have much of a sweet tooth, get them as a side."
,,,,,"I wish I had done as my friend who got an omelette, hashbrowns, and the pancakes. While I enjoyed the pancakes, I did eventually have to stop eating them for two reasons: 1) I was full and 2) They get sweet after awhile."
,,,,,"If in town again, I would return. I enjoyed the place! I do, however, think I've had better pancakes. Sorry to this branch in Chicago, but my preferred pancakes are in New York City."
,,,,,We were in Chicago for 4 days and ate here all 4 mornings because how unbelievably delicious it is. If you don't get the Signature Bliss pancakes or French toast you've made a mistake. The Key Lime Pie pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes were also delicious. Staff were superb and COVID procedures were well thought out and safe. If you're in Chicago this place is a MUST!
,,,,,"I just visited the Wildberry Cafe on Randolph and had a wonderful brunch with my friends in their extended outdoor seating area. In this way, we were assured that no pathogens were spread while enjoying the delicious pancakes, fresh-squeezed juice, and eggs. The outdoor seating did not have a long wait time either so we were immediately seated and had a lovely view of Millennium Park on a sunny morning.  This is my go-to restaurant with great food, service, and walking distance from the city sights."
,,,,,All I can say is the food here was absolutely delicious and the Customer Service was fantastic.
,,,,,Absolutely recommend coming to check this place out!
,,,,,Soooo good and the service was amazing! I got the barbacoa skillet and I was VERY impressed. The skillets are huge though definitely can be shared with 3 people. :)
,,,,,"Everything was delicious and worth the short wait! We ordered off the seasonal special menu, which I highly recommend. The staff was great!"
,,,,,"This cafe has a beautiful atmosphere and extravagant food. I believe some of it was too over the top which is why I gave it 4 stars.. which really isn't their fault because I could have ordered something else. My waffle was good but it just had sooo much berries and yogurt on it so for me it was overwhelming, however, the skillet was pretty good. I preferred that over my waffle.  We sat outside and got a chance to take in the beautiful city so that was very nice. Lastly, I wish they sold mimosas or some type of alcohol, that would have been a cherry on top! Can't go wrong with mimosas :)"
,,,,,Love that they have yelp wait list! By the time we walked from our hotel to the restaurant we made it in time for our reservation. 
,,,,,"Food: I ordered the homemade corned beef with over easy eggs, hash browns, and pancakes. It was very hearty and savory. However I probably would want to try something else next time. Coffee was okay.. "

,,,,,"Service: our server was so friendly, fast, and efficient! Especially since it's so busy, she didn't skip a beat and had everything out to us correctly. "
,,,,,"Ambiance: felt like a typical breakfast brunch place. Kind of cramped but the location is so prime to the Bean, it's understandable."
,,,,,"Just a heads up- they usually have a hella long wait on the weekends but as long as you go in with that in mind, it's realllly good! My favorites are all of the specialty pancakes (especially the cinnamon roll and Oreo) and the skillets."
,,,,,"Even when you do have to wait a long time, it's rarely as long as they estimate and they're very efficient."
,,,,,"There were six of us and the food came out 15 mins after ordering so clearly, someone is running that kitchen very smoothly."
,,,,,It's a big tourist spot but I can see why - it's so tasty. Oh and don't forget the drinks! The almond joy coffee or mocha or something and the blackberry lemonade were both great.
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,This place is awesome!  Come hungry portions are large.  Pancakes were so great!   
,,,,,The staff were all friendly and eager to serve!  Highly recommend!
,,,,,"Wildberry is on Yelp waitlist, so we joined remotely then went and got coffee elsewhere. Overall the wait wasn't too bad, I think less than an hour. "
,,,,,My boyfriend and I shared the Butcher block with a signature berry pancake (a pancake came with the butcher block and I believe it was like $2 to upgrade to the berry). It was more than enough food! 
,,,,,"And yes, this spot is touristy, but everything we ate was really delicious. The pancake in particular was just perfect. Prices were really reasonable, too."
,,,,,"What a great location to be at,,, if  seated outside you have the perfect view to enjoy.   Do make sure to get their pancakes or crepes or Belgian waffle with their Signature Berry Bliss toppings.   Coffee was on the lighter side but the food was just amazing.   The wait staff was gracious, patient and quick.   It was a beautiful day to enjoy some Belgian Waffles with the Signature Berry Bliss topping and a Mexican Skillet.   They don't have a reservations system,  but do have a way via Yelp to share with you the wait times for a table.   Enjoy."
,,,,,"We went to Wilberry this morning for brunch. I have an allergy and needed to move tables away from said food, the manager came over and was so accommodating and kind about it. Will definitely be back"
,,,,,visiting Chicago for 4 days... ate here yesterday... food is sooooo good... decided to come back again today.... might come back again tomorrow... lol
,,,,,Always love their GF pancake options -- once convinced girlfriends to make a weekend road trip to Chicago just to get them.
,,,,,"The name in itself says a lot. It was a delicious breakfast with hot waffles, potatoes and sweet oranges juice. Once the city opens, I'll go back."
,,,,,"Tried coming here on a Saturday morning at 10am; PRO TIP- show up early as this establishment is always busy and the wait can be over an hour. The menu is extensive and after eating there, it is understandable why people are willing to wait for it."
,,,,,"Our waiter was extremely friendly, but slightly pushy as there was a lot of people waiting to eat. "
,,,,,PRO TIP: the portions are HUGE and one omelette will feed 2 people easily. 
,,,,,"Being naive, we ordered the Napa Valley fig omelette which came with a choice of fruit/hash browns AND a stack of 3 pancakes. The omelette was phenomenal in that it had California dogs, scallions, bacon, and havarti cheese. I have never seen an omelette combo quite like! The other meal we ordered was the wild mushroom omelette; it was delicious! A nice thing wildberry does is you can replace your pancakes for a specialty one so we got the chocolate chip banana and cinnamon roll pancakes. Both were really good, but also very sweet. "
,,,,,"If I am in town again, I will definitely be going back! Only thing is I will be ordering less food ;)"
,,,,,Best crapes I have ever had!!! Totally  recommend this restaurant. This location  is across from the Bean. If you are in downtown it's a must place to try but go early because they close around 2 if I'm not mistaken. If your visiting a sailor in GreatLakes the closet location would be in Libertyville.  I posted pictures of both locations. You won't be disappointed with ether.
,,,,,Love this place.... Long wait..but it is worth it.  Delicious food and they load it up.  You will be totally satisfied when you leave.

,,,,,"Food was great server was great the atmosphere was cold and windy, making it more chilly 11-29-20. I noticed one thing the cleaning person was wiping the straw off the table that fell on the floor, instead of wiping chairs he just dust it he didn't even sanitize the table and chairs."
,,,,,"Everything was so amazing! The waffle was the best thing I have ever eaten.. every bite had the perfect amount of cream/ fillings, fruit, and when I added the whipped butter it was orgasmic! Hands down the best waffle I have ever eaten!!"
,,,,,"The pancakes were the perfect combination of moist and fluffy! The coconut, bananas, and crumble made this one our tables favorites."
,,,,,"The hash was fantastic.. the top layer of corn beef, hash downs, and cheese compliments the lower layer of hash and veggie mix. The eggs on top made for a great complete mix"
,,,,,Thank goodness yelp waitlist partnership. We had roughly 90 min wait via waitlist but was able to do some
,,,,,"Touristy stuff in between walk to hotel & being seated.. ie, the Bean, samsung experience."
,,,,,The wait was well worth it despite unseasonably cold
,,,,,Snowy rainy late April Saturday (this is Chicago). Portions were HUGE & the pancakes were the best Ive had in a really long time.  Appreciate the lobby waiting area for cold days and the entrance barista for coffee.
,,,,,"Hubbs had the butcher block skillet - eggs, has browns, multiple meats & I upgraded his pancakes to pine apple upside down and ordered a side of corn beef hash to supplement his stolen cakes. A chatty party of 4 was damn near silent the first 20"
,,,,,Mins of our meal - it was THAT good. Once we came up for air we got back to discussing the mellow diner-y vibe & the premium location :) do it! Plan ahead and do it 
,,,,,Sorry dove in & missed photo opp
,,,,,Best breakfast in Chicago!  Waitress was super friendly!  Food was phenomenal!  Coffee simply amazing!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!
,,,,,Great pancakes!
,,,,,"My friends and I arrived at 7am with a party of 7 and did not have to wait long. Once our table was set up, we were seated. If you're coming with a large group, i highly recommend coming early to avoid a wait or else do the waitlist with yelp. Since they don't take reservations."
,,,,,"Service, we had our drink orders taken promptly and entrees shortly afterwards. The food took some time to come out, since the place was packed but our server kept our coffee cups full."
,,,,,What I got - the Wildberry sensation pancakes. I like the combination between fruit and pancake. It wasn't overly sweet but satisfying. I couldn't finish line. I think only 1/4 of our party finished their food. The rest of us were so full!!
,,,,,- they split checks
,,,,,"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day due in large part to places like this! Fortunately, we were in town during the week so there was no wait, but honestly, if you wait, it is WORTH. IT. "
,,,,,"I had the Blackberry Lemon Cake french toast. Let me tell you. I had a hard time making up my mind. The menu is fairly extensive, and everything sounds amazing. I am not usually one for French toast, but if it's done with an unusual ingredient, I'm all over it! Basically, this was lemon pound cake masquerading as breakfast. I feel like my soul left my body for a bit because it was that heavenly. Fried rolled lemon pound cake with filling drizzled with a blackberry reduction with fresh blackberries nearby. It just doesn't get any better if you want something sweet for breakfast! Don't get me wrong, I love savory breakfast and wanted to try the skillets too, but since I was on vacation, it was time for the sweets. "
,,,,,"The seasonal menu also looked awesome. I opted for the mug of hot cider. Whipped cream was optional and I opted out. For the blustery frigid day in Chicago, it was the perfect choice, warming me from the inside. I should have gotten one to go! (I honestly don't know if that's an option, but I hope it is!) "
,,,,,"My husband got the Wildberry pancakes, and he was equally impressed. Can I just take a moment to appreciate the variety of sides available? I tried to round out my meal with a half grapefruit and a side of turkey bacon. How often do you see sides like that?? I loved it! "
,,,,,"Man, now I'm craving that blackberry lemon French toast, and it's 8:45 PM. We'll be back to Chicago this year, and I can't wait to visit again!"
,,,,,Do not be deterred by the long lines. They move quickly and the food is absolutely worth it. The space is a bit cramped but once your food arrive you will not think about that again. We left completely satisfied with extras to go.
,,,,,If you are downtown....you need to try! You have to try the Wildberry French Toast and/or the Wildberry Pancakes. I'm not usually one to have sweet things for breakfast either but this place is the exception! It gets a bit busy so be prepared to wait but it's honestly worth it. Large portion sizes and super tasty (omelettes are good too!) Would recommend if you have folks from out of town or impressing a date who wants to have a great filling breakfast. One of the best.
,,,,,Probably the best thing I ate during my quick weekend visit. 
,,,,,*Yelp wait list is a MUST. The crowds get quite large here and it is definitely worth it to do that*
,,,,,Came on a Saturday afternoon. Ended up getting there before the waitlist time around 12:15 (time was at 12:35) and got seated around 12:45. I would say its great for groups up to 4 but can accommodate more.
,,,,,"Location: It seems a little low key, near the bean part of millennium park. Parking is definitely city parking. But staff is very friendly and obviously very busy, yet they still checked on us. "
,,,,,"Food: I ended up ordering the mexicana skillet with a side of cinnamon toast pancake. My friend ended up getting the los altos eggs benedict. Let me tell you, the food was delicious. The skillet came with this spicy salsa which was perfect. Also, they did not skimp on the avocados. All the ingredients seemed pretty quality/fresh which was great. The pancakes were amazing. The eggs benedict were also good. The eggs were cooked well. Everything came with an ample amount of food with reasonable prices."
,,,,,Really would recommend and will definitely be back again.
,,,,,"Awesome!  Long lines, but worth the wait.  Pre-pandemic.  Our group ordered something different. "
,,,,,Everything was great.  Chocolate chip pancakes yum.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Food is good, service not so bad, but the initial wait time for a table is atrocious! Don't go here unless you have all the time in the world to waste on standing around."
,,,,,On the flight over to Chicago we were talking to a local and they told us that Wildberry is a place for breakfast. There was one close to our hotel. We went and were not disappointed!!! The skillet was to die for!! Pancakes amazing!!
,,,,,"Went here on a Tuesday around 1130 and grabbed the last outdoor table. Everything was covid observed, including individual packets for condiments except ketchup which came in a small ramekin. I didn't catch the name of my server but he was fantastic, friendly, kept his distance, asked me to put my mask on when he was approaching & I didn't see, and just very accommodating. "
,,,,,"Best part was that on top of that, I had THE best classic eggs benedict I've ever had, everything was perfect. Loved the thick cut ham that had a perfect sear, delicious and good amount of hollandaise, perfect poach on the eggs and perfectly cooked hash browns. I was pleasantly delighted by how good this was, as I just figured I'd go here for my eggs bennie craving. I had the unsweetened iced pineapple green tea, that was also lovely, was able to get refills as needed and was even offered my last refill in a to go plastic cup. That's hospitality!"
,,,,,"5/2018 - The wait for this place is insane, there's lines out the door and at the time, Yelp Wait list wasn't in service yet. With all the raving reviews and beautiful weather outside, we figured why not? It wasn't a big deal to wait in beautiful weather. There's parks and beautiful places nearby for us to come back and check in often on where we were in line. The wait for us was over an hour, but it was well worth the wait. "
,,,,,"Our waitress was very patient with us since we were hangry at this point and my kids needed sugar, so we got the waffles and pancakes. I opted for the WildBerry pancakes too, since well, it IS the name of the place, so it must be really good. I wasn't surprised that it was absolutely delicious. "
,,,,,"This place also had really large variety of drinks and types of coffee blended drinks here. My husband was in heaven and couldn't decide. From start to finish, our meal was wonderful and we had a great time here chatting it up with our waitress and learning about the story of this place. "
,,,,,"I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been the insane wait, but I'm sure it's gotten better now with the Yelp Waitlist option that is available now."
,,,,,Great Food.  Had the Chorizo eggs Benedict a stack of Berry Bliss Pancakes and my brother had the Napa fit omelet. So delicious and what a view of Michigan avenue. In town it's a must stop by. Cheers from Los Angeles
,,,,,"This was my first time to Chicago and this was hands down the best spot I went to. Possibly the best breakfast place I've ever been to ever. Any chance of getting a California, Bay area location?!"
,,,,,"The food was SO good that we ended up ordering from DoorDash 2 days later. No judgement. They seated my mom and I in about 15 minutes, but we would have waited 3 hours if needed. After we were seated, we were greeted by our waitress within minutes and she took our order. The food came out pretty fast considering how busy it was."
,,,,,"First, the coffee. I ordered a Hazelnut latte with almond milk. The coffee itself was so good that it really didn't need any type of milk or sweetener. My mom ordered the turtle mocha and said it was one of the best coffees she's ever had. *Side note: we are intense coffee drinkers and it's safe to say we are very picky about it."
,,,,,"Now on to the good stuff, the food! As you can probably see from a majority of the reviews the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes are what they are known. They are even better than people describe them to be. The toppings are so sweet that you don't even need the maple syrup. You get 5 huge fluffy could pancakes with berries on the side. Perfect for sharing if you decide you want to try other things on the menu."
,,,,,"I also ordered the classic eggs benedict. This comes with a pretty large serving of hash browns which were also delicious. You get, of course the poached eggs with the fattest slices of ham on top of the english muffin and hollandaise sauce. Amazing flavor! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to eggs benedict is that the english muffin is too small that it turns into mush under the eggs. This was the perfect size in ratio to the eggs and ham."
,,,,,This will be my first stop on my next trip back to Chicago!
,,,,,The churro French toast were delicious and so were the cinnamon pancakes. Delicious breakfast foods. I can see why they're always so busy!
,,,,,One of the best breakfast spots in Chicago! So delicious!. Always very packed so make sure you make a reservation or get there early! I love the barbacoa chiliquiles
,,,,,Wow. Just wow. This place was packed on a Thursday morning and for good reason. 
,,,,,"I got the garden skillet with scrambled eggs and my girlfriend got the signature berry bliss pancakes. The skillet was so warm with plenty of cheese and perfectly cooked hash browns. The eggs were also buttery and cooked perfectly. I have no complaints for this. Their pancakes were also so fluffy and sweet and just good. Their fruit was also sweet and juicy and big. I couldn't finish the pancakes that come with the skillet and the skillet, and it was such a hard decision as to which I wanted to take home and reheat. "
,,,,,"Service was good, especially for somewhere as packed as this. They don't even have time to take the tip from the table before they seat the next guest. My water was always filled and they checked back to make sure everything was good multiple times. "
,,,,,I will definitely be back when I am back in Chicago.
,,,,,"This place is sooooo good! We came here on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend and it was packed. The wait was an hour but luckily the park is across the street so we wandered over there. The food was all so good, service was quick and kind, great for kids! We would definitely come back!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Went here on a whim before heading to the airport. Oh my.....had the mushroom omelet and regular pancakes. They where amazing!  Meals are large and certainly could be shared if you have a small appetite.  Will certainly try to come here again when in Chicago!
,,,,,Pancakes and Omelets are my favorites! Call ahead for reservation lunch time is SUPER busy! Enjoy! :)
,,,,,"Did Door Dash for my crew and the burgers were packed in foil containers with lids and were all sweaty and fries limp. It was hot, way too big of a sandwich. It is like overeating....They were fast and are pricey for delivery "
,,,,,Never had breakfast and heard it was good but always packed before Covid.
,,,,,I knew it was not a bell ringer as my staff were not going the usual yums and ooh ahh. 
,,,,,Good menu selection and possibly better when dine in. It is hard to keep food quality crispy in a steamy container.
,,,,,Located on Randolph with walk in entry  and no easy parking
,,,,,It always has a line. But you can get their good delivered via Door Dash. Pricey..large portions..delicious and hot..minimum amt required.  I ordered for my staff. 3 stars because good was steamy soft. Fries soggy bun soggy to go containers trap in moisture too good but we scarfed it down cause ur was still hot.  Very large portions .salads yummy.  I would do again
,,,,,"Awesome visit as always! We got here not long after opening, on a week day, to make sure we didn't have tooo long of a wait. We arrived and were promptly seated. Our waitress took our beverage orders which aways were presented quickly, then we ordered and even the food came out fast! I have to admit I expected a bit of a delay because this place is always busy but there was none! The food looked so good that I forget to take proper pictures and we dove right in! My caffe mocha had a beautiful whipped cream with chocolate drizzle that I ate before I remembered to take a picture. Everything was awesome! "
,,,,,Okay enough exclamation points. Come early if you don't want the long wait. Use the Yelp wait list time so you get a bit of a jump on the line. Get ANY of their coffee drinks and order your favorite breakfast. No doubt you will have a great breakfast! If you come later in the morning there WILL be a wait; I've waited 2 hours before and the food was worth coming back.
,,,,,"Great location, tons of options, friendly staff. The environment could have been better because it is very cramped and loud inside. It was very very busy. The prices where also a little high but it's high quality food so I thought it was reasonable. I had the vegan hash with cauliflower hash. It was a very creative meal but didn't taste that great, I especially did not like the vegan meat patty."
,,,,,"From the time we walked in until the time we left, everything was excellent. The service was top notch even though they were busy. We ordered about 5 different plates and all of them were amazing. If you happen to be in the Chicago area I highly recommend having breakfast here."
,,,,,"Simple dishes executed really well with high quality ingredients. We had the Berry Bliss Waffles and the Tuna Panini. I normally don't even like waffles but these are great! The panini was very yummy, too. We had high expectations and this place did not disappoint."
,,,,,"Such a wonderful restaurant for brunch! I put my name on the waitlist on yelp. When we got there, my check in time expired but they let us through anyway. We didn't have to wait an hour to get a table"
,,,,,"We ordered creamy Nutella, veggie omelette and Denver skillet dish, as well as blueberry bliss pancakes and coffee and orange juice. "
,,,,,Creamy Nutella was not impressive but the omelette and the Denver skillet dish made up for it. I loved the veggie omelette and asked for mozzarella cheese. They are too generous with their cheese so ask for less or none of you can't handle too much cheese. 
,,,,,The blueberry bliss pancake tasted more like a cake than a pancake. It was very Delicious! The writers told us it was number one selling pancake.
,,,,,Staff is super friendly. And our total bill was only $45!! It was cheaper than our parking for 2 hours!!! 
,,,,,"After our brunch, we just walked out to the millennium park. Such an excellent location!"
,,,,,"Highly recommended and didn't disappoint. As a Floridian, some of the best oj I've had. "
,,,,,Manager was kinda rude until he found out we were paying customers but other than that nothing to bad
,,,,,"Great location! Especially as COVID season is still around, there's tons of outdoor seating options. The hostess was really nice and my friends and I got seated quickly. We went around 8:30am, which explains the no wait, but around 930 we started to notice people waiting for seats. "
,,,,,Menus are QR code except for the seasonal specials menu. Mask rules obviously still apply. 
,,,,,"Food overall was good! I ordered an omelette with just figs and goat cheese. The figs weren't as sweet as I'd hoped for, making the dish a little bland, but the overall quality was still up there. My friends ordered skillets which smelled and looked amazing, and they both recommend I try them next time I visit. "
,,,,,"Service-wise, nothing to complain about. Our server was always nearby but never hovering, and our waters were always being filled by wait staff. Location is perfect with it being right next to the park and near the heart of the Mag Mile. Overall nothing to rave about, but it's a great location with consistent quality food and service!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Food came out fresh and very quickly. Service was good. Only thing is you have to wait outside in the cold for your table. 
,,,,,It would behoove this establishment to put 1hr 45min timers on tables inside so there is no line out the door.
,,,,,Delicious breakfast and good prices for the portion size (huge). It's located right across the street from Millenium Park (also close to the art institute if you want to make a day out of the area). The service was good and overall it was a great experience. I would definitely go back again.
,,,,,"Good breakfast food! The coffee was also good. We came on a Friday morning and they were packed!! We had to wait about 20-30 minutes which isn't terrible considering it was during Lollapalooza. The service was good, the outdoor seating is good to people watch. The food also came out hot! The pancakes are soo good! I definitely recommend if you visit Chicago"
,,,,,"Delicious good, huge portions."
,,,,,I ordered the Tuscan chicken panini..it was delicious. 
,,,,,"I also the berry pancakes, which were also delicious!!"
,,,,,Must try when in Chicago!
,,,,,Great brunch spot!
,,,,,The wait was a long one which was to be expected being so close to Millennium Park. We were told the wait would be 25-30 mins but it ended up being more like an hour. 
,,,,,"Once seated we ordered fairly quickly. The food was really good. I ordered a jasmine ice tea and the strawberry lemonade and the hubs ordered the vanilla berry latte. My drinks were really tasty and the hubs enjoyed his latter. For entrees we ordered a Belgian Waffle for the little one, a specialty dish for the hubs and I ordered a create your own omelette. The food was really wonderful. I ordered avocado with my omelette which was not added in the omelette. I advised the waiter that the avocado was missing, which wasn't a big deal but only so I wouldn't be charged for the extra topping, and the waiter was really apologetic. I remember saying tot he hubs it wasn't such a big deal. The manager then came over to let us know the omelette would be comped. Truly spectacular service! "
,,,,,Another great point is that have little writing pads for kids instead of the little crayon and coloring sheets. I thought this was a great option because there was no mess.
,,,,,Food: 3
,,,,,Decor: 2
,,,,,Service: 2
,,,,,Probably the most popular brunch spot in Chicago. I come here pretty open when I'm in town.
,,,,,"Classic eggs benedict, 15"
,,,,,"-Poached eggs, ham off the bone, toasted english muffin, homemade hollandaise and hash browns"
,,,,,Okay. Pretty average compared to other benedicts I've had. 
,,,,,"Signature berry bliss, 15"
,,,,,"-Berry mascarpone filling, fresh berries, vanilla cream anglaise, blackberry coulis"
,,,,,"Okay. A tasty sweet dish with lots of berries and fluffy pancakes. Huge portions though, so highly recommend splitting this with 2-3 people."
,,,,,"Service was a bit disappointing. We were seated quite quickly despite not having a reservation, but they couldn't do much to reseat us when our table got invaded by bees."
,,,,,What a great breakfast spot! Definitely my favorite breakfast I had while I was in Chicago!
,,,,,"Tons of options on the menu will keep you coming back for more! All the food I had hear was excellent! The place seems to be very popular, so the earlier you check in the faster you'll be seated. We went on a Monday morning around 10AM and it took over an hour to be seated... YIKES! "
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,naturally... we went with the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes. SOO GOOD. I recommend you ask for a side of extra berry syrup to dip in. These pancakes are a lot of food so I recommend you split it with someone else.
,,,,,We also got the Butcher Block skillet which was also really good. The side of Bacon was amazing! 
,,,,,Also... don't forget to order the Wildberry Orange juice!!!
,,,,,Everything I've ever ordered from here has been delicious. I love the eggs Benedict and highly recommend trying the cinnamon pancakes
,,,,,Service by Shaquille F was very efficient and friendly. I liked the 20 minute wait for a table for 2 that turned into 15 minutes. We had the Butcher Block Skillet. Napa Omlet and upgraded to the Blueberry Danish Pancake. All were excellent.  Portions were large. Pineapple Iced Green Tea was very refreshing on a hot day.
,,,,,Don't get the hype about this place. The pancakes were pretty mediocre. We got the signature  berry bliss which wasn't anything too exciting. The pancakes I felt weren't fluffy enough. Also got the cinnamon roll pancake which was just ok as well. What was really good was the Barbacoa chilaques though. Very good. I got the eggs over medium. 
,,,,,"The waiter was friendly but the wait here is just a bit too long for my liking. Then again, what can you expect from a downtown location that is always busy."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St

,,,,,"The hype is real with this place! With COVID, their proper safety measures helped me feel more comfortable. "
,,,,,"Honestly anything you get from this menu will be amazing, I'm sure of it. Everything was cooked perfectly, and tasted great. "
,,,,,We got cinnamon pancakes and the 
,,,,,"*I got a latte, but didn't like it.* however, will still give this place 5 stars because the foooood!"
,,,,,"We sat outside so the wait was not as long. The food arrived quickly and it was delicious. We had the several different pancakes which were all delicious. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean. Definitely will be dining at again! Which I had a chance to snap some photos."
,,,,,The wait is worth it!  
,,,,,"After you get past the long lines to get a table you will be pleasantly surprised by a varied menu with lots of options. We had the coconut cream pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes which were both sweet and balanced. The corn beef hash was done  perfectly, the hash browns were meh but not bad.  The fresh squeezed juice did not disappoint either. The waitstaff was attentive and on top of their game despite being very busy.   The prices were reasonable compared to other places we had breakfast nearby and good people watching if you eat outdoors :)"
,,,,,Amazing food!! The red velvet French toast is so good!!! And the skillets are amazing. Very tasty and flavorful.
,,,,,Food was good. Daughters booster seat fell off the chair it was sitting on. Daughter cracked her face on the table on the way down. Daughters bleeding and screaming. They immediately brought us the check. Server said my manager just told me to drop the check. Nobody even asked if she was alright until after we asked for the manager. Gave us some bandaids. We paid and left without finishing our meal.
,,,,,Great food and had great service to return
,,,,,Just needed to acknowledge the Crew here! Look forward to your full return
,,,,,This place is worth all the hype. This place is worth the wait. Really good brunch spot. Big portions. You'll be stuffed before you start your day. 
,,,,,Crepes were excellent. Pancakes were so flavorful without any syrup. Skillet was delicious. High quality food here. The portions are massive so be prepared to eat. Best to get several things and share so you can try a little bit of everything. Everything that everybody else got around us looked amazingly delicious!!
,,,,,Tip: They REALLY won't seat you unless your whole group is here. Even if your friend is in the bathroom...
,,,,,Believe the hype and reviews! This place is scrumptious and my server was cool! Definitely eating here again when I come to Chicago! OH...EM...GEE!
,,,,,I'm here on hump day and off from work. They kindly sat me down immediately as soon as I walked in (yay) around noon!
,,,,,"Sipped on the most perfect cappuccino with caramel I've ever tasted! No exaggeration! I ate the Mexicana with scrambled eggs (hard). I took a video because the picture did no justice! Talk about mouthful of surprises: eggs, jalapeños, cheese chorizo sausage, avocado, hash browns, etc! I also had the buttermilk pancakes (which they sprinkled the suga on top). Delicioso!!!!!!!!! Everything...great!!!"
,,,,,"Of course, I could not finish it all and thinking about if it makes any sense for me to get a to-go bag when I'm heading to the Millennium Park. Nope...not a good idea!"
,,,,,"Don't get the hype. First off, the wait times are not accurate you will get a text on the high side of your wait time and then are called to do additional waiting inside of 15-20 more minutes. We watched staff seat a same sized party several people behind us before us. I get it, it's not always possible to anticipate how long someone will be eating but this is an orchestrated system... once you are brought inside it is not a ""moment"" prior to you being seated. Second off, no alcohol license? Personal owner preference? But a brunch without mimosas is not a brunch imo. "
,,,,,"Now onto the food, I ordered a strawberry mango smoothie it is absolutely not made fresh. It is sickeningly sweet, like a concentrated mix you'd use for a frozen peach bellini, ironic right. Ordered some combo platter of 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and upgraded signature berry pancakes. The bacon was cut too thick & not crispy, i won't eat limp pieces of bacon. The hashbrowns were missing any semblance of seasoning, salt? Pepper? Bueller? The eggs were ok, but also needed seasoning and butter. After not having eaten all day I left half my plate uneaten... Now the star of the show, pancakes... these have a unique texture and sweetness in the dough. The pancakes were good, not amazing  but good. "
,,,,,"Agree with the other reviewers that bus boys & staff are rushing you out of the place, i get people are waiting but bro there's still food on my plate. I'd rate my local IHOP higher than this place."
,,,,,Love this brunch place. The GF avacado toast has definitely become one of my favs. 
,,,,,Southwestern Benedicts are also super yummy!

,,,,,"Their service is terrible. You can order to sit down and eat during busy times but they will harass you if you take your food to go. They get really busy,. I tried to order on DoorDash but they stop taking orders early so I went in to try to place an order. They told me I can sit down and eat which I would've only had about 30 minutes to eat because of the closing time but I cannot take my food with me to go. Otherwise I would not have been sat down. Which doesn't make any sense"
,,,,,"We had a mixed experience at Wildberry Pancakes where they've definitely got their machine well oiled. You're invariably going to have to wait for a table...we did and got in in under the estimated time...and we witnessed, while we were seated and dining, a period of no more than sixty second pass from when one party left a table to the table being entirely cleaned, re-set, and seated with another party. Impressive!"
,,,,,"The coffee and tea were good. Sadly good coffee at breakfast focused establishments is not always a given, but here at Wildberry, the Intelligentsia Coffee the served was a good, bold French Roast which satisfied my particular coffee needs. good French roast"
,,,,,They also serve Numi tea which is a more premium tea bag experience with better flavor choices than a typical tea assortment.
,,,,,"The food, for me, was not as good as I wanted. I had a ""Create Your Own Signature"" omelet whichI ordered made with egg whites, and fig, scallions and Havarti cheese on the inside. (I was trying to create their ""Napa Valley Fig"" omelette without bacon and saved a dollar by creating my own rather than ordering that without bacon.) So making eggs or an omelet with egg whites is a hit or miss proposition as not everyone knows how to properly prepare egg whites, and this was a bit of a miss. The eggs were overcooked - actually slightly burned and brown in color.  Despite that the mix of flavors were pretty good but the scallions weren't that present. It's also a giant (American sized!) portion which I couldn't finish. Overall I felt it need a little more flavor."
,,,,,"The hashbrowns it came with were again a giant portion that, unfortunately didn't have much flavor to them. They were cooked properly, crispy on the outside and rightly soft but not undercooked on the inside. But had to add salt and pepper to get any flavor."
,,,,,"I also had an English muffin for my bread choice which looked right, nice brown spots on it, but upon eating it I realized it was under-toasted so not as crispy as it should've been and very ready (as opposed to ""toasty"") on the inside. Maybe this is what I get for not ordering pancakes at a place with the word ""pancakes"" in the name, but every item I ordered was lacking so, despite their attention to speed in churning through many many customers, I feel they should pay a bit more attention to flavor in quality."
,,,,,"My wife had the Wildberry Crunch Oatmeal which was a giant bowl of legit steel cut oats with plenty of berries to go around (we were suspicious that they weren't actually ""wild"" berries...haha). They also brought almond milk and honey on the side which was lovely an exactly what she needed for a diet."
,,,,,The atmosphere is nice. It's an up-scale and spacious breakfast place with plenty of good cheer from the staff. We do wish the food taste matched the obvious popularity of the place.
,,,,,"Delicious breakfast spot! Celebrated my anniversary with my husband, first time in Chicago, and we ate at Wildberry every morning we were there. SO glad we found this spot. Everything we tried was great, especially the Churro French Toast! Hate I can't get that anywhere in Atlanta, so I'll definitely be back"
,,,,,"I tried this place based on the reviews and because of its proximity to my hotel.  It did not disappoint.  We had to wait an hour to be seated, but it was worth the wait.  I ordered the omelette, hash browns and plain pancakes.  Whatever they put in the pancakes, I think it was vanilla, was very tasty.  I almost didn't need the syrup.  The service was great.  I was very pleased."
,,,,,2nd time here in Chicago and we had to come again.  The reviews were great the 1st time.  We waited 2 hours the 1st time.  2nd time 20 min.  The food was very good the 1st and 2nd time.  Totally worth the wait.  Good food and excellent service
,,,,,"This place was recommended to my friend and I by my brother in law, I WAS DELICIOUS! We had the banana coconut cream pie pancakes. Service was great. The restaurant was busy but we got seated quick. No brunch drinks but its ok."
,,,,,Believe the hype! Food was amazing and service was great! We did the most popular pancakes and omelet! I didn't love the icing stuff on the pancakes but other than that everything was amazing! ((I'm not a big cream cheese person!) omelet was outstanding and the juice we had was yummy!  Can't wait to go back and try some other menu items!
,,,,,|Food|
,,,,,"I got a basic breakfast plate with hashbrown, toast, and bacon and my boyfriend got the plate with wildberry pancakes for a small upgrade on the side. I think that's a super great idea if you want to try the wildberry pancakes but don't want to fully commit to the regular size order! "
,,,,,"Although the pancakes were really sweet due to the sauces, the pancake itself is sooo good. My sister got the plain pancakes and it was good even without the syrup!"
,,,,,|Service|
,,,,,It was okay. We didn't interact with our server much.
,,,,,|Overall|
,,,,,"If i'm ever in Chicago, I would definitely come back. I think it's worth the wait time. I suggest putting your name down and exploring the Bean across the street while you wait!"
,,,,,"I came here for breakfast one morning after a recommendation from a friend (& seeing all the great reviews). We came within an hour of closing, so we didn't have to wait in a huge line."
,,,,,"I ordered the chicken and waffles & my fiance ordered eggs, sausage and french toast. I also got a strawberry lemonade, and he got an iced tea (which was swapped for orange juice because we forgot American's iced tea is unsweetened compared to Canadian iced tea!). "
,,,,,I am not sure the hype on this place.. perhaps just for the pancakes?? Our meals weren't anything special.. and costly at that too. My waffles didn't seem cooked through enough either..
,,,,,"2/5 stars because although the waiter was super friendly and nice, the food was mediocre at best."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Love this restaurant, we visit every time we visit Chicago !! Red velvet French toast is a must try !!"
,,,,,Great service.  Fast checking helped with rain storm. Food delicious.  Will keep coming again and again.
,,,,,"Wait time can be very long, about 45 min to an hour, but let me just say it is well worth it.  I do suggest booking through yelp first so you don't really have to wait.  They are kid friendly, in fact they gave the kids some magnetic drawing pads to use for our visit and that kept the kids occupied.  "
,,,,,"Ordered mango lemonade (so good), vanilla berry latte (amazing), kids order of fruity pebbles pancakes, 2 fruit cups, corned beef eggs Benedict with fruit cup as well (which was confiscated by my son).  "
,,,,,I will say everything was delicious.  The kids enjoyed their breakfast and so did I.  They ate everything for the most part.  The corned beef hash was so crispy and perfect.  I was so full off of just 1!!  WHAT?  
,,,,,Our server Kimberly was attentive and friendly.  She offered suggestions and they were great.  
,,,,,"Overall, we will certainly be back before we head back home.  Because there is so much else to try but man everything looked so tasty.  The menus are HUGE!"
,,,,,"Food was delicious! Kid friendly. Service was great. Fair warning - these are the biggest servings of food ever. You could easily share with another person or 3 kids could share a regular order of pancakes. The vegan hash was so good! We were concerned about the LONG line to get it, but it moved very quickly and was worth the wait."
,,,,,"Okay truth is, I didn't expect to love it so much!! I've  heard all the tourists and suburbanites flock here by the droves and as a city-dweller that's exactly what I purposely try to avoid especially since it's next to Millennium Park and every time I ever walked by it looks like a massive wait outside. "
,,,,,Anyhow YELP TIP: you can waitlist yourself (and your brunch bunch) in this Yelp app and basically bypass the line and check-in when you get the text. Boom yeah baby!!
,,,,,"Yes even so it appears like chaos as you walk up, but in reality it is a very well controlled chaos which I'll give them props for being able to manage the masses so well. "
,,,,,"Once seated, expect to be promptly greeted by your server. If y'all are lucky you'll get Jeremy who honestly was a standout for friendly top notch service. He has a contagious smile and very good energy! Loved that when it came time to pick a side, he said ""okay are you sure you want toast? Because I can sub in basic or fancy pancakes or even crapes if you'd prefer!"" Okay, yea let's go for it!! (With those options, who seriously opts for plain ol' toast? Don't do that to yourself... live a little, indulge) "
,,,,,From the time he took the order to the time fresh coffee was poured was 3-min! Juice and water a snap of a moment later by a runner. Every table was  at capacity or was being bussed pronto for the next hungry bunch. I'm convinced the whole staff lives off octane to be able to keep that pace up all shift! 
,,,,,"Portions were plentiful and of quality. Prices were very reasonable for what you get and if you leave hungry, you'd have to be a moose because to-go boxes seemed a popular table offering as checks were paid. Big bonus... I was sent out with a nice fresh cup of Intelligentsia coffee! Wildberry, you impress me! See you again soon."
,,,,,"If you have allergies, I would highly recommend you do NOT eat here, because their menu is misleading and based on my experience, their manager and waiters are not properly educated in accommodating guests with allergies. They told me that there was NOTHING safe for me to eat, even though their menu is labeled as gluten friendly. "
,,,,,"I am very disappointed. I am Celiac and have a nut allergy, and prior to coming to Chicago, did my research on the ""best"" gluten free friendly restaurants in the city and Wildberry came up on that list, listing gluten free friendly across their website and menu. When I arrived at the restaurant, I put my name in with the hostess and asked and confirmed with them again that they were able to accommodate allergies, and they said yes, of course! After waiting for an 1.5 hours on their waitlist, we were finally seated. As I was placing my order for gluten free pancakes (as spelled out on the menu), I flagged my allergies to confirm everything I ordered was safe for me. But the waiter said that they cannot guarantee the food is safe, and in fact, the ""gluten free"" pancakes are made on the same surface as the wheat pancakes, so they were not really gluten free, the batter just did not contain gluten. I changed my order to an omelet, and the waiter, again, said that the food would not be safe for me. I asked to speak with a manager, and he proceeded to tell me that they do not have ANY food that would be ""safe"" for me to eat. My boyfriend ordered his meal to go, and we left, so that I could go find a Chipotle to eat our to-go meals in Millennium Park. When you have allergies, you do not expect to be able to eat everything at every restaurant, but you go out to eat because you do not want to miss out on a social event and end up ordering something that is safe, but a lot of times, boring, to eat. The exception is when you specifically go to a restaurant that claims they are gluten friendly and accommodating to allergies. This is when you feel excited to eat and feel that the chef and kitchen staff have been trained to make managing your food allergies a bit easier. I am very disappointed at the misleading menu & website, and false advertising from Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe. If you have allergies, I would highly recommend you do NOT eat here, because their menu is misleading and based on my experience, their manager and waiters are not properly educated in accommodating guests with allergies."
,,,,,"The staff really moves people in and out, walked up to a long line  out to the street and our party of five sat immediately. Very friendly and efficient service. Food was delicious. We got the rocky mtn crepe (pic), sweet corn and avocado eggs benedict (pic), mexicana, and the denver. The wildberry orange juice was great! Highly recommend this place!!"
,,,,,There is so much food...
,,,,,"Come here and be prepare for a little wait. However, this is a big place. The service was friendly and fast. The food here was a lot. I had breakfast left over for the next day. General guide would be to be share a dish with another individual. Otherwise, you will be stuffed and want to skip lunch. Also the park is across the street so you should start walking it off."
,,,,,I was told that I had to eat here when I was in Chicago and I wasn't disappointed. We went on a weekday last month so the wait was around ten minutes. We tried to go during the weekend and the wait was over an hour so we decided to go somewhere else. The Mexicana skillet was amazing and it was balanced out by the sweet cinnamon roll pancakes.
,,,,,"So tasty! I built my own skillet with feta cheese, scrambled eggs, spinach, and turkey sausage, it was soooo good!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Those were the best dang pancakes I have ever had! My only regret is that I don't live in Chicago so I can get them more often.
,,,,,Best pancakes ever!!! We also had one of their omelettes which were delicious and huge!! If I am in Chicago again I will be back!!!
,,,,,Way too expensive for what they served us.  Why would anyone want to pay )13-15 for French toast is beyond me.  Tried it once for the experience but wouldn't do it again
,,,,,"The food was great and portions was so large I couldn't eat it all. I wish we had a Wildberry in Atlanta. I would have given it five stars but Marco my waiter was lack luster. I had to ask for items he should have been top of.... refills, hot sauce etc. In spite of I still tipped above 20%."
,,,,,Was unable to pick up order due to Chicago Marathon on 10/10/21.  Called store several times and was unable to get through.  Called on 10/11/21 and was unable to get through.  Finally someone answered today 10/12 and was unable to provide me with any resolution.  Justine answered and relayed my issue to the manager.  The manager answered and was not helpful in any way.  I spent nearly $50 for an order that was not possible to be picked up nor could the store provide me a resolution.
,,,,,The food was great and the wait time was less than excepted. Looking for a nice view outside for Sunday Brunch this is the spot. I had the Cinnamon Roll pancakes and the Butcher Block skillet. Definitely will need a to go box!
,,,,,Good food and drinks. Disappointing that they are not taking online orders right now.
,,,,,"Wow! Great food, Great Location, Great food options. But, if you were looking for a nice relaxing brunch with the gals don't expect to find that here. It felt more like airport security. Instead of you being able to just put your name in and wait, you had to go through like 3 different checkpoints. The wait to get our table and our food was one of the quickest I've ever experienced, that being said I felt extremely rushed. My friends and I were expecting to be at brunch for a long time, we were there for about 30minutes. Super friendly staff, just extremely fast paced!"
,,,,,"We stumbled upon this place for breakfast and are still talking about the food. Everything we had was great, but the show stopper was the pancakes. The cinnamon roll pancake may have changed my life. I will be forever in pursuit of trying to recreate that dish. The berry pancake dish was a close second. The americano I had was hot and strong. I don't go to Chicago often, but I may go back just for those pancakes. "
,,,,,"Ambience was nice, patio isn't as pretty during Covid but it was nice to be outside, shaded and had plenty of space. Overall, recommend."
,,,,,"When we asked around about must spots to eat in Chicago, several people mentioned Wildberry Pancakes. We decided to do a quick visit for brunch and had a good experience. We were able to get a table right away and service was great throughout our meal. The menu is pretty big and includes everything from omelettes, skillets, paninis, burgers, salads to waffles, french toast, and of course pancakes! I decided to get the Mexicana Skillet ($15) and I was very surprised at how big of a portion it was. Unfortunately I wasn't too happy with the taste of the chorizo and the fact that the eggs were a little tasteless. What made up for this was the Signature Berry Bliss French Toast creation ($13) which was amaaaazinggg. Def. shareable as with all of their plates. My friends ordered paninis and burgers and seemed to enjoy their meals. I think the only element missing here is some alcohol/mimosas."
,,,,,"Keep in mind they close at 2:30pm! Def. recommend if you're looking for good service, big portions, & reasonably priced breakfast goods!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Great place for breakfast and brunch!
,,,,,Wait times: get there early in the morning for no wait. We waited maybe 2 minutes about 30 minutes after opening. 
,,,,,Service: very friendly service and very quick. Gets your order right. Makes appropriate suggestions. Seemed knowledgeable about menu. 
,,,,,"Food: delicious as you would expect from the pictures! Really great pancakes. And the fruit tasted fresh! Their chai wasn't traditional Indian chai but it was still decent. It is quite heavy food, but it's what you get, and it's quite tasty! I will say their portions are quite big so consider sharing items "
,,,,,Atmosphere: it's very Clean and fresh looking. Noisy but more on the lively side and not annoying. Really clean tables and bathrooms. 
,,,,,It's a nice place to go eat near the magnificent mile. Nice food. I have had comparable food elsewhere but this was also really great!
,,,,,"Every restaurant we've visited during our trip had masked staff. It's absolutely ridiculous that the staff and guests are not required to wear masks if they're vaccinated. Only about 40% of the population is actually fully vaccinated, so I don't believe everyone in the establishment is fully vaccinated. I felt SO uncomfortable dining there with our waiter talking to so many guests and then to us and on top of our food. None of the waiters during our visit were wearing masks. Disgusting and irresponsible during a pandemic. "
,,,,,Inside the tables were spaced out but not the patio. It was very crowded. 
,,,,,We had a stroller and we had to carry them down the steps. There was not an accessible method for strollers or wheelchairs. Wtf? 
,,,,,"The food is ULTRA mediocre. Like, I really don't understand the hype. My food tasted like it could have been from a chain breakfast spot. What a wasted meal."
,,,,,Woke up early .. hungry ... so while i waited for the sun to rise and hubby to wakeup i read breakfast reviews. With over 6000 rave reviews thought this was a good sign. Reading the reviews made me so hungry. 
,,,,,       I had gathered from the reviews  it would be crowded and could get on the waitlist from yelp. This was a first for me. Highly recommend doing that ... the wait was over an hour. 
,,,,,         Several items sounded delish .. id already decided we were going to share the Rutherford omelet with hashbrowns and berry bliss brioche french toast. Omg best breakfast ever.  I loved the French toast and i never like fruit stuff .. suprising. The combo was excellent.  Highly recommend this place.
,,,,,"I LOVE the fact that you can get in line on the Yelp app. I walked out of my hotel and by the time i arrived it was my turn to be sat. The place was slammed when i got there. I went alone and sat down towards the back of the restaurant. The server was very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions. Believe it or not but their OJ is fresh squeezed, meaning they squeeze the juice right out of the fruit and it's room temperature so that's how you know it's really real - bomb. "
,,,,,"now down to business. I ordered the mexican skillet - didn't LOVE it but it wasn't bad. I felt the ""chorizo"" tasted more like taco meat then authentic chorizo. I think they were a little heavy handed on the cheese but that could just be me. I also got a side of the bliss berry pancakes - these were perfection, Fluffly and light and delicious."
,,,,,"Came to this place because of the high ratings, but honestly for the price of the food I would expect better quality. If you like ihop or Denny's go there instead because the price is better and the quality is the same."
,,,,,"Wildberry Cafe crowd was consisted of families with small kids, retirees who just came from a pickle-ball session, students - everybody was there!"
,,,,,Service was great but omitted to mention one important factor - the portions are huge and it can be easily shared.
,,,,,Life has changed after a Lavender White Mocha this is the perfect start to the day! It is like serenity in a warm mug.
,,,,,Juices freshly squeezed reminded me of classic European breakfast.
,,,,,You will not make a mistake with any choice. My omelette was great.
,,,,,I hope that they open their cafe in our DMV region as this was top breakfast option.
,,,,,This spot has a long line on weekends. I decided to pick up to avoid the line. My meal was packed up well and tasted good. I truly love their pancakes!
,,,,,"Food and service are great.  No umbrellas outside and if it's sunny and 85, good luck!"
,,,,,"I've been to Wildberry several times now, but my latest visit prompted me to leave a review due to the excellent customer service."
,,,,,"We were visiting during marathon weekend, so everywhere was even more crowded than usual. When we arrived at Wildberry around 11 a.m. on a Saturday, the wait was an hour and a half. "
,,,,,"When we were finally seated, we were greeted right away. We noticed that there were only two place settings but they quickly arrived with a third without us having to ask. We ordered, and within 10 minutes we had our food. Our server anticipated all of our needs, checked on us frequently and was extremely friendly and efficient. "
,,,,,"As for the food, Wildberry is consistently delicious, no matter what you get. Warning: the portions are HUGE. I'd definitely recommend splitting a meal. My sister and I ordered the Napa omelet (sub pancakes for toast) and couldn't finish. "
,,,,,Wildberry for me is a Chicago staple and not a place to miss while visiting the Windy City!
,,,,,"Wonderful breakfast. We ate here just after doing the river cruise and I ordered the waffle with two eggs, turkey sausage, and hash browns. Everything was great, especially the waffle, but the turkey sausage was just ok."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Was not really worth the wait. If you are into bland food this is your place, if you are wanting something with flavors I'd go somewhere else"
,,,,,"Well worth the hour and a half wait. The portions were big. Definitely can be split between two people. Pancakes were incredible, super fluffy. The jam that came with our toast was amazing! We also got the butcher block skillet which was a cheese lovers dream and packed with lots of meat."
,,,,,"The line is worth the wait! I've never had such simply delicious pancakes, they were soft fluffy and way more flavorful than any other generic chain pancakes. I ordered the breakfast meat skillet and it was also very flavorful and a very large serving. I tried their kiwi lemonade and it too was yummers. The servers were great and the Resturant was clean. I'm from Florida and I promise you I'd travel to get that Resturant again. Bring wild berries cafe to south Florida"
,,,,,"Over rated place! I feel like it is mostly for the location because the foot is whatever. This place is not like anything special, the wait is crazy busy and it is a quick in and out mostly because they try to open tables to serve more people. The food is just like any other American diner. We waited for a good 3"
,,,,,"40 minutes trusting the Yelp reviews, but later we learned there are better options. "
,,,,,"Btw, they don't have an electronic waitlist where they will text you or give you a buzzer and that is why everyone is waiting right next to the host, trying to hear their name being called."
,,,,,Breakfast was absolutely delicious. It was that perfect spot to stop by after taking pics in the park across.
,,,,,Delicious food.  Not huge servings but enough.   Always hot 
,,,,,Have had really great servers too which is always a bonus
,,,,,Went on a Sunday morning before heading out to Wrigley. Host said the wait time would be 45 minutes. We had been here before so we were prepared to wait. Went for a nice little walk and received our text that they were ready for us. That was right in that 30-45 minute window. Service was A+ food was A++ I had the corned beef skillet with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything was excellent! Highly recommend
,,,,,"Came to Chicago for vacation and decided to stop here for breakfast. The wait was 1hour but I tell you what well worth the wait, food was off the chain, pancakes were to die for. You will be missing out if you come to Downtown Chicago and don't have breakfast here!!!!!"
,,,,,You know the scene where Indiana Jones *swoops* through the door before the giant boulder crushes him? I very nearly had the same experience when visiting Wildberry: our party got seated immediately and then instantly watched the wait time swell to 84 minutes in the Yelp app. Ouch!
,,,,,"The highlight for me was all of the gluten free items. You can get the pancakes, waffles, sandwich breads all made GF. Skillets and salads can be adjusted. Ultimately I was torn but caved on the Barbacoa Chilaquiles. It was savory, hearty and perfectly spiced. I sometimes get a gag reflex with barbacoa because I've had some questionable meat cuts at Chipotle, but Wildberry was not doing me dirty like that. The meat was high quality and tender."
,,,,,"One dish that I was expecting to like but didn't was the cauliflower hash: it reminded me of coleslaw and I'm a hater. You can be rest assured that Wildberry lives up to the Yelp hype. Would I wait 84 minutes? No. But if you can swoop in early and you're by Millennium Park, check it out."
,,,,,"Great restaurant, great food & located very close to where I live are all HUGE positives BUT the only drawback I find is that most of the waitstaff are EXTREMELY SLOW !!!  I always get there first thing in the morning when they open their doors, basically every week, and I'm one of their first customers in the door but it'll take up to 10 minutes many times before someone approaches me and asks would I like something to drink while most of them sit in a corner eatin', drinkin' and chattin' until they're ready to get up! This morning very well may have been my last time there. If a restaurant opens up at 7:00 then the employees should be expected to start then!!!!!!! This was a loyal customer who is tired of experiencing this practically on a weekly basis!!!!"
,,,,,They would definitely be a 4 or 5-star review if it wasn't for this FACT!
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Wildberry is a breakfast spot I return to time and again--it is so near and dear to my heart. The service and dishes are always phenomenal, and always consistent. Is it slightly pricey? Yes. But that would be the only thing I would change."
,,,,,"No purpose leaving a review here. 11/10 Staff always attentive, food pricing exceptional, quality of food supreme. Do not pass this place up"
,,,,,"First time visiting Chicago and this was the first place we got breakfast. The wait wasn't too long for a Tuesday afternoon, and the service was good. The food was incredible, I had oatmeal with fresh berries which was exactly what I needed to start the day right. My travel buddies ordered an omelette and pancakes respectively. The wildberry pancakes did indeed live up to their name - they didn't even need any syrup."
,,,,,"The food here is good, but pretty typical of what you would expect to get from a diner/breakfast place. I don't really understand the hype around this place, but the food is good."
,,,,,"We got the Denver skillet with a side of the signature berry bliss pancakes and the cinnamon roll pancakes. The skillet was tasty, but pretty comparable to skillets from other breakfast spots. I was, however, a bit disappointed with the signature berry bliss pancakes. They were pretty dry and the berries and spread on top didn't really add too much to the flavor. The cinnamon pancakes on the other hand was very good and I'd recommend trying these! They were very fluffy and had a true cinnamon roll flavor."
,,,,,Poor customer service -- how do you have a waitlist on the app no one answers the phone -- it directs you to this app that doesn't help at all. Not satisfied.
,,,,,This place was fantastic! One of the best meals we had all week! I had the berry pancakes and my husband had the chicken biscuit breakfast sandwich with gravy. Both were outstanding. The waiter was terrific and the atmosphere was great. We were at a window seat table. I highly recommend eating here. Couldn't be happier.
,,,,,Wildberry is the top yelped breakfast spot in Chicago.
,,,,,"Located in downtown, in a super busy area. Street meter parking, $6.50 per hour. Closest street parking is off of Beaubien Ct, right around the corner from the restaurant. "
,,,,,"Was empty at 7:30 am on a Monday. Service was good. Food came out really fast. Big restaurant, I can only imagine how crazy it is on weekends."
,,,,,Orange Juice - $4 - Very fresh.
,,,,,"Two Eggs & Sausage Patties w/ Berry Bliss Pancake - $12 + $2 - Cooked as I wanted. Nothing special, just good breakfast. Swapped the pancake for the berry bliss pancake, you get 1 piece. Sweet and over the top berry pancake, but so good!"
,,,,,"Barbacoa Chilaquiles w/ Oreo S-mores Pancake - $15 + $2 - Tender flavorful barbacoa, shredded and stewed nicely. Toppings were a great addition. Eggs cooked well. Swapped the pancake for the oreo smores pancake, you get 2 pieces. Sweet and over the top like above but with oreos, so good!"
,,,,,"One Egg Meal, little berries - $5 - Comes with eggs, hash browns, & toast. Also comes with apple juice."
,,,,,"Good, fast and delicious.  The staff friendly, they are busy so plan to wait for few before they take your order. But it was worth it."
,,,,,"This place can be SUPER busy during brunch hours, even on weekdays! Make sure to call ahead or make a reservation through Yelp. "
,,,,,"My favorite dish was the Banana Cream Pancakes and the Harvest Skillet. The Los Altos Benedict was okay, and the Chicken and Waffles had a smaller portion of chicken than I would expect. "
,,,,,"Our waitress was okay, seemed rushed the entire time and wasn't the friendliest. I understand that they are busy though. "
,,,,,The location of this restaurant is right across the street from the Bean and Millennium Park! It's a great place to come to before or after you explore the park. 
,,,,,"In my opinion, this place was a bit over-hyped. I still enjoyed my food and it is definitely worth a try!"
,,,,,"My second visit felt a little bit off from the first. I'm just going out on a limb and say I might've ordered the wrong dish. Not that it was bad, it didn't feel like it exceeded my expectations."
,,,,,There's no reservations and just remember that you will only get seated with the whole group present.
,,,,,I got the espanola with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. Red flag right there was that it was excessive and I pretty much took one bite of the pancakes and had to leave the rest because I was stuffed (should've planned it better within the group). The espanola I stopped reading the ingredients 3/4 of the way so I was surprised with the bed of tortilla (which I also tossed). It was overcooked and tasted burnt with every bite. The hashbrowns were decent. 
,,,,,Not enough to turn me off completely so I'd visit again if the situation calls for it.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"High quality food. We were not disappointed at all! I had the long time dreamed Napa Valley Fig omelette, ohhhh so good! My friend had butchers' block, he liked it too."
,,,,,The only reason I'm taking out one star is because some of the waiters tend to drop their wooden serving stands like hell... Many people were scared to jump on their seats because it's so sudden and so noisy!
,,,,,The toast was not very toasty. Warmed up. Wheat was better than raisin. It's 4 bucks for 2 pieces of toast. Raisin was so airy. Poached eggs were runny and not hot enough. Bacon was thick but kinda hard. Fruit cup was fine and pancakes were too. The butter was soft but not real butter that doesn't melt into toast but the white color remains on top of toast. The service was good and fast  but 26 for breakfast without coffee or juice is kinda robbery. This reminds me why I eat breakfast at home. It tastes better and for 26 bucks I could have this breakfast every day for two weeks at the same cost. Tempo is way better and less moola.
,,,,,If you're looking for a good brunch in Chicago... this is the place! I recommend putting yourself on the waitlist thru yelp but you have to be 1 mile away to do so. We did that and then walked around and explored the area. There's lots of shopping stores near by and the bean is close as well! It was about a 50 min wait. 
,,,,,"I ordered the Butcher Block which was an amazing breakfast skillet filled with bacon, sausage, ham, cheese and hash browns! It was really good and also topped with an egg. It came with a side of toast! "
,,,,,"My cousin wanted a regular breakfast and it also came with a side of hash browns and toast or pancakes. Since I got the toast, he got the pancakes because we wanted to try their signature berry pancakes. It was an additional $2 for specialty pancakes. The pancakes were topped with berries and the pancakes were light and fluffy. It was good! "
,,,,,We enjoyed our meals very much and had a lot of leftovers. The skillet was a heavy meal and I was only able to eat half. They don't serve alcohol but they had a bunch of coffees to choose from.
,,,,,The place is right next to the Kraft Heinz Corp headquarters so it was very convenient.   The place was packed and I was seated in 5 minutes.   Very efficient and friendly.  Oh holy night is playing in the back ground.  Marvelous. 
,,,,,I ordered a coffee and blueberry danish pancake.   Coffee came Back in a sec.    asked the waitress to bring the check with the food since I only had 30 minutes before a meeting next door. 
,,,,,"Pancakes came in another 5 minutes and the check with it.   Very, very good , a bit sweet but I expected that with loads of blueberries and toasted almond slices.   "
,,,,,It does not get better than This place for breakfast.
,,,,,"So so so good!!! We couldn't eat inside because of the state mandate but the servers and staff went above and beyond for a pleasant experience. We eventually got a little heater next to our table... it helped but not much... but then again can't complain :)  It was our first time here and oh my gosh! The signature pancakes are truly to die for. Good thing I read the reviews and saw all the pictures on Yelp before making a visit ;) This place did not disappoint! We ordered a side of the signature pancakes and it was the first thing we ate haha! We don't even like pancakes and those were incredible. I ordered the Florence Benedict and my friend ordered the Mexicana Skillet. Delicious, but not as delectable as those signature pancakes-- party in your mouth! Definitely coming here again when we return :)"
,,,,,"I was not going to miss out on this place for brunch. Third most reviewed spot in Chicago, most reviewed brunch spot in Chicago, the hype is real. I put myself on the waitlist for this place a few times before canceling because the wait would be over an hour long. I've also had the problem where it says the waitlist on Yelp is closed. I've called the hostess and they told me it takes a few minutes for it to open up on the app for some reason. They have no problem canceling on you if you're not there in time as they have plenty of other parties patiently waiting so I'd advise getting there earlier than you anticipate."
,,,,,I ordered the Signature Berry Bliss Waffles. It is as good as advertised. The berries and the sauce they use taste amazing with a bite of waffles. Adding maple syrup is not needed to make it taste better. My gf got the Wild Mushroom Omelette with Cauliflower Hash. I was able to try a bite of both. I thought the omelette is really good while I'd most likely prefer the regular hash over the cauliflower ones.
,,,,,"The server himself was very friendly, helpful, everything you can ask for in a waiter. He was very patient with us, was able to answer any questions we have, and made any suggestions."
,,,,,This place definitely lives up to the hype doing what they do best: serving amazing brunch. A must visit staple if you're in the Chicago area.
,,,,,"Amazing pancakes and great service. The skillets are HUGE, and so good as well. The wait time was over an hour on a Saturday, but the meal was well worth the wait."
,,,,,"I can for 3 reasons.  I was starved, it was close, and the amount of reviews blew my mind!!!!  "
,,,,,"I ordered the Denver Skillet, eggs sunny up, with Pancakes and Blackberries. I have to say I was slightly underwhelmed, it smelled great but lacked some in flavor.  I do like that the peppers and onions are larger pieces and not diced up to the point you can't taste them. "
,,,,,Pancakes where bland tasting with only slight help from the blackberries.  After a couple nights I decided the berries was all that was going to get eaten.
,,,,,From what I got I don't see the hype.  I hope others have a better experience.
,,,,,"For weekend brunch, do not trust the wait time that they tell you! It will be much, much longer. When we put our names on the waitlist at 9:15am on Saturday, we were told a 45-60 minute wait. We received the text that we were up at the 60-minute mark, but then had to wait another 30 minutes in a second line off to the side for our table to be ready. So total wait time of 90 minutes when we were quoted 45-60 minutes. We were especially sensitive because we had an early afternoon flight to catch. Beware :/ "
,,,,,Food was pretty good. Lots of sweet and savory options. Service was friendly and efficient once we were seated.
,,,,,Great food. Great service. Dustin especially was wonderful. Thank you for everything.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,This place was amazing! All of the food was so fresh and delicious. If we ever go to Chicago again this will definitely be the first place we go to eat!
,,,,,Wonderful food. Love the one in Schaumburg. Great place to go for breakfast with the family.
,,,,,"I have never gotten even close enough to smell the pancakes here. But judging by the line that always proceeds the entrance, these are the best pancakes in the world! Hands down!!"
,,,,,Great place to hangout with friends and family. Their food is excellent. Wildberry pancakes were awesome
,,,,,"Wow.. like this food is A1!! I had to pause in eating to write this because I'm getting full and need to make some room, but I have never had a scramble so good!! And their oatmeal is premo!! I love a good steel cut oat and they did not disappoint!! 10 out of 10, would recommend!! They are also very Covid conscious, which I love!!"
,,,,,"Satisfying breakfast restaurant with efficient and friendly service near Millenium Park. Very busy even on a late Wednesday morning, but fortunately we did not have to wait for a table.  A line formed though shortly after we had been seated.  I was expecting the restaurant to be larger than it was.  Tables are closely placed together."
,,,,,We ordered: 
,,,,,"pumpkin waffles a la mode-fantastic, crisp with candied pecans"
,,,,,Signature wildberry pancakes - huge stack of tender pancakes; could have used more berry sauce as was a bit dry
,,,,,"Garden skillet - huge portion again, vegetables tasted fresh"
,,,,,Los Altos Benedict - slightly spicy with chorizo; eggs well prepared
,,,,,Overall a safe bet for breakfast
,,,,,Pancakes are so good!! Very heavy so def come with an appetite. I also got an omelette which was very good! Only thing I'd say is be prepared to wait in a long line because this place is usually PACKED
,,,,,This spot is a must! I have been coming here every time I am in Chicago! Short wait times! Great friendly staff & awesome food!
,,,,,This review is solely for the cinnamon roll pancakes. They're fire. Probably one of the best pancakes I've had. I usually like regular degular pancakes with good ol butter and syrup. I'm usually not much into the extras. But man the cinnamon roll pancakes are so damn good. The cream cheese frosting is drizzled on top and I lowkey wanted more of it. It was stacked with 3 pancakes and I tried to eat it all but sadly couldn't anndd I was visiting out of town so couldn't take the leftovers. They were so good I wanted to go again the next day. I also ordered a side of hash browns but they weren't anything to rave about.
,,,,,Great food and service! My boyfriend and I were visiting from Alabama and it was one of our favorite spots. Great location too.
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Best breakfast place I've been to so far.
,,,,,"Everyone was friendly, and expect a wait to get food, as the venue is always full."
,,,,,"The pancakes came out near instantly, service was attentive and pleasant, we loved our waiter Eustace, he was so nice and had good manners, we loved him!! and the pancakes were steaming hot and delicious."
,,,,,"The place is clean, and good lightning, great location and great vibe here. Seating is well spread , and mask is required."
,,,,,Definitely recommended!!!!
,,,,,"This is now my go-to when staying in Downtown Chicago.  I ordered the Wildberry French toast.....OMG!!!!!  It was to die for.  I also had the turkey sausage, which I was surprised that it was on the menu, and they give you 3 patties.....also wonderful!!!.  The Wildberry Orang juice....very tasty!!!!.  The atmosphere and customer service was excellent.  Please make sure you try this place out and you will no be disappointed."
,,,,,It was everything they said it would be is how i'll start this review. no disappointment at all super friendly staff and servers you are greeted in the front with a huge hello and welcome really making you feel at home. a great breakfast destination while in chicago. only down fall was no adult drinks but all in all was amazing food was super delicious.
,,,,,"Only thing that makes this a 4 star review is that the restaurant was hot, other than that everything was delicious. Cinnamon roll pancakes are a must & to make it a manageable meal we got the short stack (2 pancakes) then had some savory potatoes, bacon, and eggs. Every part of the breakfast was done really well which is rare!"
,,,,,The breakfast was delicious.  The wait was 1.5 hrs. on saturday morning 
,,,,,but the food was worth it.  I ordered Mixed Berry pancakes.  The cappucino
,,,,,was delicious too with sugar free caramal syrup.
,,,,,Outside dining is now available (as of 06/13/20)! Had a beautiful brunch overlooking Millennium park at Wildberry. They had excellent service considering the COVID guidelines. All staff wore masks and the tables were appropriately spaced apart. The condiments were packaged in individual containers which encouraged cleanliness because these condiments are not shared among diners. 
,,,,,"Although the dishes are a little pricey ($$), the portions are HUGE and well worth the price. We ordered the Florence eggs benedict and chocolate chip banana pancakes. The pancakes especially were a surprisingly large portion. We had leftovers to take home!"
,,,,,The eggs benedict were delicious. Perfect hollandaise sauce and the bits of bacon in between gave it a great savory flavor. The chocolate chip banana pancakes are the perfect option for vegetarians/plant-based eaters! It came with both chocolate and white chocolate chips with a heaping amount of chopped bananas. Would recommend both dishes.
,,,,,Never not busy. Food consistently good. Fast and friendly service. Breakfast is recommended for portions and the coffee.
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,Amazing attentive staff.  Several options of interesting and classic breakfast choices.  Ability to get in line and wait electronically.
,,,,,"Starting from top and going to the bottom-Mexican Skillet, Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes, Eggs Benedict)"
,,,,,We waited almost 1.5 hours and it was totally worth it. While we waited we checked out Millennium Park and walked around to kill time. There's a lot going on in the area so doesn't seem like you've been waiting long. If you're staying close by I would recommend putting yourself on the waitlist via Yelp. The staff was super friendly as well. 
,,,,,"The food- the portions are huge, I don't think we finished even half (there was two of us). Everything was great and the cappuccino is a must! Before coming here I thought how good can pancakes possibly be, but you have to try this place to know there is a way to perfect pancakes."
,,,,,"Wildberry is probably one of the best breakfast places in the area.  The food is always good, the serving sizes are huge, and the service is always friendly."
,,,,,"They have a decent size indoor dining area, and also plenty of room outside (weather permitting), but they get busy early so prepare to wait in line if you sleep in.  The service is always very good, friendly, and we never have to flag someone down for service.  "
,,,,,"The only disappointment I've had with the food is when they're out of a menu item.  Everything I've tried has been delicious.  The corned beef benedict is wonderful, although I do get the sauce on the side.  The Rutherford and the wild mushroom with prosciutto omelets are both amazing.  Of course, you really can't go wrong with a simple eggs & protein (get the ham!!) breakfast.  It's enough food for at least 2 meals, but you won't want to share, just keep the second half for left-overs.  "
,,,,,"We've been happy with their delivery as well.  Delivery breakfast and brunch food can go wrong pretty quickly, but we haven't been disappointed with any of our orders from Wildberry."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"The wait was ridiculous but it was soooooooo with it! The food was excellent, the servers and host were great. We will be going back again before our trip is up. I got the Denver skillet and my guy got the Oreo pancakes which he loved. Neither of us could finish our food"
,,,,,I'm not a huge fan of waffles and pancakes........but this was hands down the best waffle I've had in years. Everything we ordered was a huge serving and tasty. Great service and friendly staff. Highly recommend
,,,,,"I'm not the biggest breakfast/brunch person (because I hate waking up early), but Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe is probably my favorite place for breakfast/brunch now. I joined the waitlist through Yelp, so I didn't have to wait over 2 hours at the restaurant. I ordered the Two Eggs Any Style with the Choice of (Scrambled, Sausage, and Pancakes), and my friend ordered the Minced Ham & Cheddar Eggs. Not only were the portions large, but the food was already really tasty! "
,,,,,Order:
,,,,,"- Two Eggs Any Style with the Choice of (Scrambled, Sausage, and Pancakes) (5/5)"
,,,,,- Minced Ham & Cheddar Eggs (5/5)
,,,,,- Wildberry Orange Juice (5/5)
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,- Great tasting food 
,,,,,- A lot of options to choose from 
,,,,,- Quick and nice service 
,,,,,"- Large portions, especially for the price"
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,- Very long wait ~ I recommend joining the waitlist through Yelp
,,,,,"- They only give a small amount of ketchup and butter, so you constantly have to ask for more"
,,,,,Overall:
,,,,,- I highly recommend Wildberry to anyone looking for a great brunch place and definitely see myself going back soon
,,,,,"The wait time is a little long, but once you get through the ten or fifteen minute wait (in the morning) the food is absoultly delicious and well worth the wait."
,,,,,Super pro-tip: You can get in a virtual line for a table so you don't have to wait around like a doofus!
,,,,,"If not already obvious by the lines of people, the massive amounts of Yelp reviews, and the central location next to Grant Park, Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe is the breakfast place of breakfast places in Chicago. My opinion is that while it's pretty good and worth a 4-star review, in the end it's pretty much a straight up breakfast joint with good picture-worthy pancakes. There's nothing super unique about it but it has earned its spot as the place to be and be seen for breakfast in downtown Chi-town."
,,,,,Dishes I tried:
,,,,,"1)The Butcher Block - Hash browns, cheddar & jack cheese, 2 eggs, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage & bacon"
,,,,,"This dish is just a jumble of different breakfast items that are chopped up. The servers will recommend it, but I wouldn't because it's most hash browns and not much protein. It's like a trick."
,,,,,"2) ""Signature Berry Bliss"" Pancakes - Berry mascarpone filling, fresh berries, vanilla cream anglaise & blackberry coulis"
,,,,,"Well, if it's their signature dish/pancake, you have to get it right? It's sweet and delicious. Of course it is--it has mascarpone! Not mind-blowingly different, but it is tasty."
,,,,,"3) Eggs Benedict - Poached eggs, ham off the bone, toasted English muffin, homemade hollandaise & hash browns"
,,,,,"These is classic eggs benedict. The ham was pretty good, but again, it was just a class benedict and no reason to wait in line to try this dish."
,,,,,"All this said, the food is average, but the convenience (if you're staying in downtown), the history, the popularity, and I guess the signature pancakes, make the trip worth it. Albeit, I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes for a table if you can help it (refer to super pro-tip above). Thankfully, they have a texting symptom."
,,,,,I ate here my first morning in Chicago on a long weekend trip and it was delicious! Great staff and I enjoyed the food so much I visited another location (only because it was walking distance from my hotel) twice more during my stay. Thank you!
,,,,,Highly recommended place to go for brunch/breakfast.
,,,,,Nice place and good staff 
,,,,,You can make your own breakfast by mixing items
,,,,,"Breakfast here was great. Big portion dishes. The interior environment was okay but nothing unique. The wait here is pretty long (even if you get here early, expect to wait outside with a bunch of other people waiting)."
,,,,,The food was soooooo good. I had the cinnamon rolls pancakes and the skillet with meat(can't remember exact name). The caramel macchiato was 100x better than Starbucks. I can't wait to come back to Chicago to come here again.
,,,,,"SO amazing! Their menu is extensive, with so many options. My spouse and I went for my birthday breakfast and we were not disappointed. I got the pancakes with chocolate chips (pictured) and my spouse got the BLT w/ an over easy egg added. For how busy they were the service was wonderful."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Delicious brunch. I got the omelette which also comes with hash browns and two pancakes - it was SO much food, I wished I could've brought my leftovers with me but I had a busy day after. My boyfriend got the brisket grilled cheese with fruit and we both agreed everything was tasty. The location is great. The wait was fairly long, but once we sat down the service was very quick."
,,,,,"Amaaaaaazing. Their signature pancakes are literally worth the hype. The coffee is really freakin good. and to top it off our server was so fantastic. Don't even think twice about whether or not you want to consider eating here, YOU DO and you want 3 servings of their signature pancakes."
,,,,,To avoid waiting in line be sure to reserve a spot on yelp about an hour and a half to two hours before you plan on getting there on a weekend! I did this Saturday morning around 9am and was 164th place in line on the app. We got to the restaurant at 10:30 am like how we were promoted and had to wait another 15-20 mins for the table to be ready so be prepared for a long wait. 
,,,,, The portions are absolutely massive!! You're definitely getting a lot of value here. My bf and I were starving and we could barely eat half of our order so try to share if you can unless you're a competitive eater with a massive appetite. I've liked everything I tried here and I think it was worth the wait! Just reserve a spot on Yelp and skip the line!!
,,,,,"So the knock on this place is the wait ... but it's sooo worth it!  The pancakes are simply amazing, with so many kinds to choose from!  The omelet was very good. They also have outdoor dining (which I assume came with COVID restrictions) but I hope it does go away because it's nice to enjoy the breakfast in the beautiful weather."
,,,,,"Went here with a group of 6 - got a table in about 20 minutes on a Saturday. My niece and nephew loved the Oreo pancakes and had a great time. My sister-in-law had the fantastic house special crepes, wife had eggs Benedict, I got delicious pancakes, and brother-in-law had an omelet. Everything was great. Definitely recommend if you're on your way to the Art Institute or other nearby attractions."
,,,,,Food is great and the staff hustle to get you served which is really great since there is usually a wait.
,,,,,"We drove all the way from Grand Rapids, MI to have breakfast. "
,,,,,There were a few places in the running but we landed on this one.
,,,,,HOLY.MOLEY. This place really delivered a fantastic experience.
,,,,,The staff was SUPER friendly and we got our food super quick!
,,,,,The pancakes had a mascarpone cheese on it and it complimented the sweetness and balanced out the rest of my breakfast. The chorizo was kinda salty but it was still delicious.
,,,,,We will be recommending for people to make the special trip.
,,,,,"Wildberry is always a solid option for a filling and affordable lunch in the city. I always appreciate brunch places that has options that allow you for both something savory and sweet for breakfast without having to get 2 entrees. Most of the egg based breakfast options here come with a choice of either toast or pancakes! And for a small upcharge of $2, you can get a choice of their specialty pancakes! Their pancakes is what's really special here - I keep coming back time and time again for their berry bliss pancakes which has a mix of blackberry coulis, creme anglais and berry marscapone. Their entrees are all very large servings so come hungry or be prepared to take food to go."
,,,,,The wait for this place can be intimidating but Yelp has made it easy with the wait in line app. Start reserving your spot in line as you're making your way into the area. There are tons of shops and Millenium Park close by to walk around to enjoy downtown as you wait for your turn to come. Their service is quick along with turnover so you can easily get seated in an hour or so even on a busy day. The wait app lets you see what place you are in line so you can plan your day better! Wish all restaurants had such a service!
,,,,,Not 5 only because of the wait and the fact that the tables are a little too close together in this time of COVID and because they discontinued the Yelp on line wait list system.  Great food and friendly staff.
,,,,,"Comfortable, friendly, good breakfast grub.  We went for a late breakfast on a Friday, early afternoon, so no wait.  I'm told it can be much worse at other times, though."
,,,,,"Disappointed to update the review to dock a star but I was a little disappointed in the food on my lAst visit. I categorized Wildberry cinnamon roll pancakes as possibly the best I've had but after going to more breakfast joints, I can't say that based on my last experience."
,,,,,"The service was pretty good and the sides were solid as usual. I tried the cauliflower hash instead of hash browns which was very tasty but it  did have a strong onion flavor  for those that wouldn't like that.  After paying the up charge for that and egg whites, it added several dollars making it an expensive breakfast. The pancakes were  lukewarm and sloppily-made compared to prior experiences. Just weren't on their game."
,,,,,My hubby tried the seasonal biscuits and gravy. It had an evident italian spice (as described in the menu) and the sausage gravy tasted much like pizza sausage. I thought it was good and very interesting take but my hubby said he prob woulsnt  get it again because he prefers a more traditional flavor but biscuits were good.
,,,,,"Ok.... I'm a pancake freak and I've had cinnamon roll pancakes at like 8 different places. THESE ARE THE BEST IVE EVER HAD!!! I will dream about them... kinda pricy for the platter but worth it! Perfect texture, nice and fluffy! I'm boring and just got egg whites and ham for my sides but both were good! No syrup needed!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Decided to check this place out for brunch since its near my hotel and it was definitely the right call. It is highly rated on Yelp and opened super early. I arrived at 7:30am on a Sunday and the restaurant was already at 60% capacity! 
,,,,,Food that we ordered:
,,,,,- signature berry bliss pancakes
,,,,,- banana coconut cream pancakes
,,,,,- garden skillet
,,,,,- eggs benedict
,,,,,- freshly squeezed OJ
,,,,,"The quality of the pancakes were absolutely amazing!! They were HUGE, stacked 5 layers high full of fluffy goodness. Their signature berry bliss was really good, but is a little more on the sweeter side. My favorite was the banana coconut cream pancakes. Their garden skillet and eggs benedict are also good options if you're looking for something more on the hearty side. The OJ is also BOMB, definitely a good pick me up in the morning. By the time my party left around 9:30am, there were tons of people waiting to be seated inside and out the doors! I would recommend coming early if you want to skip the line. Great spot to satisfy those who have a sweet tooth!"
,,,,,Had the Mexicana Skillet and Strawberry Bliss Waffles. Both were two delicious dishes. I would definitely come back for the waffles   
,,,,,"The downside, there is no alcohol. Wanted some mimosas during brunch but the best they had was just the OJ."
,,,,,This place was AMAZING! I am in town for a trip and saw revie2s of wildberry. We had a short wait to get in but it wqs not that long and when seated the food and service was prompt. The food wAS AMAZING. Probably the best fluffiest and softest pancakes i have ever had! I got the brisket hash with a side of the blueberry danish pancakes. It was beyond good. The space is super cute and while it was busy it was not super loud. They aldo played some great music which i liked a lot. Overall great place with great food!
,,,,,"Best breakfast and lunch in downtown. Worth the wait, Although even around 930 on a beautiful Sunday morning the way it was only about 40 minutes. If you go around the corner and up to blocks you can always grab a Starbucks while you wait and it makes the time go by. The skillets are wonderful and their cauliflower hash was delish and a nice substitute for the potato hash browns that might make a skillet extra hearty. Pancakes were wonderful. Service was attentive as well."
,,,,,"Pancakes were the BEST. Was not happy with the chicken sandwich and had hair in that entree, but our server Christian was amazing and handled things in a way that would not deter us from coming back for breakfast food again here. Thanks Christian!"
,,,,,Always good! So busy so get there early! Wished they still used the NOWAIT app so we could check in for a table. Now you can't check in until you get there. SHARE! Portions are HUGE and breakfast never heard well so share your meals!
,,,,,"Lovely place to eat, atmosphere, location, just a nice experience . Yelp wants me to keep writing, that's all folks"
,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe. This is definitely the place if you're a person always craving for such delicious treats! and since I am one, I am very glad to know this place. Since I would always go to work, at the morning this is the place where I would usually hang around. Their foods are the best, especially for a breakfast! Good foods to start my day with and it definitely is a great place to choose, their Cafe is just peaceful and homey, it has that kind of vibe that just wants you to relax and the sale of the place was as well such pleasing, and the place is filled with neatly organized tools and ornaments. very stylish but not too much, just enough to please one's eye and it definitely would always catch mine. whenever I would bump in to this place, there is no way I won't go in. Their place is also very big, so I don't really have to wait for in line for that long. Just going in there, their staff were all very friendly and would greet you with big smiles, and proceeds to go through the menu. And speaking of the menu! It is all highlighted with such sweet and delicious treats! Some foods like crepes, pancakes of course, waffles and many more. And the taste is just, immaculate! Definitely worth the money! I recommend this place very much since I have gotten here multiple times already, keep up the great work! Definitely going back here again for another time."
,,,,,"Great restaurant! The food was delicious and kept me fueled up for the rest of the day. Yesterday was the first day that we tried this place, and I know fully understand why there is an hour wait sometimes to get a table. We had to try their signature berry bliss to see what the hype was about. Cannot go wrong eating here for breakfast"
,,,,,"I was immediately seated during brunch on Thursday! There was no wait the entire time I was eating, so it seems like weekday mornings are your best best for minimal waits."
,,,,,I ordered the Rutherford and tried two specialty pancakes: Banana Coconut Cream Pie and the Signature Berry Bliss. If it is your first time here I recommend getting either a skillet or a omelette and upgrading your regular pancakes to specialty so you can try one of the delicious pancakes that Wildberry is known for. 
,,,,,"Everything I tried was delicious, but I actually enjoyed my omelette more than the pancakes! The goat cheese in the omelet was REALLY GOOD and such a smart, unique way to add creaminess to the eggs. I wish the pancakes came with mascarpone on the side or cream filling on the side, or if they had more of it in between the pancake layers. That's my only complaint because I thought the pancakes were good otherwise. The berries on the Signature Berries were very sweet and complemented the dish well."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Please hire someone to answer the phone. The Wait time feature on Yelp isn't working and that is all i needed to know. I won't drive downtown to come here unless i have an idea about the wait times.
,,,,,"I came here with some friends after hearing about how great this place was.  I really wanted to try small portions of a couple of items, but they only offered full orders.  Since it was a little pricey and I really can't eat THAT much, a friend and I decided to each order a different full meal and split it.  I highly recommend doing this.  I got to taste the classic eggs benedict and the signature berry bliss pancakes.  Both were great, as was the coffee!  The only downfall to this place was that we had to make reservations for a weekday late morning breakfast, and of course, the downtown parking."
,,,,,"Visiting for the first time and choosing this place for breakfast was such a great idea. I ordered the ""Signature Berry Bliss"" french toast and it was soooooo good. It looks overly sweet but it actually isn't and thats what I loved about it. The service was also a 10/10 always checking up on their customers and was very fast. I loved this place and will definitely come back when I visit Chicago again."
,,,,,"I came here back in november for a little chicago trip and i was looking for a cute breakfast spot but when i tell you wild berry blew me away it literally did and i was so shocked on how amazing the pancakes were, next time i come back i need to come here again!"
,,,,,"I had breakfast here based on all of the of the great online reviews. My first attempt resulted in a two-hour wait, so I said no thanks and discovered another great place a few blocks away. My second attempt was successful - my hotel was close by, so I ran down to put my name in for the list, went back to the hotel to do a few things and returned in time to eat. And only then did I realize that Yelp has a wait-list feature that could have saved me that whole back-and-forth."
,,,,,"For breakfast, I ordered eggs and vegetarian sausage patties, and their famous wild berry pancakes. The food was all good. You really can't go wrong with fried eggs (okay, maybe you can if you are picky about the yolk). The veggie sausage patties were NOT what I was expecting. They had good flavor and I ate them, but I'm not sure I would order them again... they were more wild rice patties than anything I'd had before. The pancakes were good - complete with a berry mixture and berry syrup. Sugary sweet topping on nice, fluffy pancakes. Delicious, but nothing so out of this world that I'd wait in line again to have."
,,,,,"Came here because it was recommended by a vlogger. There was a long line but they gave us the option to either sit outside or inside, so the line moved fast! The service was fast & the atmosphere was lovely! This was my first meal in Chicago & truly was 5/5! The staff was also so friendly and chatty! Food came promptly and the it was also amazing! We got a lot of food for a great price! Need to go back for another peppermint hot chocolate!  Perfect spot to go to if you are visiting the bean!"
,,,,,"Ummmm the wait was 40 minutes on Friday morning but so WORTH IT. If you are visiting from out of town, make sure you come here. We literally are so full, so come hungry. May need to take a nap after FYI."
,,,,,Highly recommend ordering the egg dishes with a side of speciality pancakes they actually allow you to order a side of speciality waffles if you'd like instead. 
,,,,,In sum: FAST CLEAN DELICIOUS!! Worth the wait!!!
,,,,,"We needed to refuel after trekking to the Bean to get our early morning pics.  Luckily, Wildberry was right across the street.  There was no wait on a Monday around 7:15 am, but was starting to fill up quickly! "
,,,,,"- Caramel pumpkin latte:  I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin.  I know...*GASP*!  This latte was perfectly balanced: not overly pumpkin-y, not overly sweet, not overly creamy.  Get it while it's here!"
,,,,,"- Berry bliss crepes:  The thickest crepes I've ever had with a way-too-sweet, imitation-tasting strawberry cream cheese filling.  I wasn't a huge fan of this, but I did enjoy the fresh berries on top."
,,,,,"- Cauliflower hash:  Bland.  Better with some hot sauce, but still way too *healthy tasting* for me."
,,,,,"- Sausage patties:  Can't really mess these things up.  They were definitely a pre-cooked frozen item, but I dug them."
,,,,,"Fast, friendly service!"
,,,,,So unbelievably awful. Reminds me of a Denny's or iHop. The only reason it's always busy is because there are tourists constantly coming through. Also they are one of the few restaurants that open early on the weekend. If you're lucky you won't get the shits after. Food like this is an embarrassment to Chicago and any good review is most likely from a tourist that's visiting from a fly over state.
,,,,,Let me start off by saying that this is the BEST breakfast spot ever.  
,,,,,Not because their syrup is presented in fancy saucers.  
,,,,,"Not because the waitress was very friendly or because they have security (?), but because the food is AMAZING.  "
,,,,,We started off with the Turtle Mocha.  Think of turtle candy filling and whipped cream atop a cup of warm chocolate mocha.  It was delicious.  
,,,,,We then moved on to the good part...the FOOD.  
,,,,,Their pancakes are soft and fluffy.  I even let a couple of mines linger on my plate and they didn't get hard.  Their hash browns are PERFECT.  
,,,,,But the highlight of the meal had to be the VELVET FRENCH TOAST.  It almost tastes like cake.  Sweet..soft..and fluffy.  
,,,,,Now if only Wildberry built a location in Florida...(hint hint).

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Can't go wrong with getting breakfast or brunch here. Portions are large and worth the price. First time I went in spring 2021 my party of 5 had about a 30-45 min wait at 10:30 and this past week on NYE I arrived at 9. My party if 2 was seated promptly and was in/out within an hour. Very attentive servers but be prepared to be seated in a packed house.
,,,,,We went here 2 days in a row and would have made it back a third time if we didn't have an early morning flight to catch.
,,,,,"The staff are friendly, the crepes are delicious, the Los Altos Benedict I definitely would recommend, as well as the Mexicana skillet "
,,,,,It's just awesome breakfast can't really say any more that.
,,,,,"The only thing I probably didn't like were the waffles, but that was just me personally."
,,,,,"I honestly think people rate breakfast places way too high. Most places serve similar quality and would say that Wildberry is no different. The pancakes were fine, but I'm also just not too big of a breakfast guy."
,,,,,Always a delightful experience at wildberry. Food is simply exquisite for breakfast/brunch & burgers are great too! 
,,,,,Love that it is so family friendly & accommodating! 
,,,,,Portions are HUGE (usually enough for 1-2) so prepare for lots of leftovers.
,,,,,"I mean the food is good. Plain and simple. There is nothing more you need to read. Everything is good, well I lied. The only thing that is not good is the wait. But just join the yelp waiting list and they tell you when to arrive and you are immediately seated. Oh I lied again, there is also no alcohol sold there which is a massive bummer "
,,,,,Wild berry pancakes- what they're famous for. Nothing spectacular. I would still rank ihop higher 
,,,,,"Hash browns- classic, crispy, fun to eat "
,,,,,Chicken biscuit- that gravy is BOMB 
,,,,,Southern Eggs Benedict- the perfect egg. Wow I am amazed. The biscuit was still flakey under that gravy.
,,,,,Ugh counting the days until I can come back
,,,,,The most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. Had to try it. I caught it on a weekday with a colleague. There was no wait at all. We even scored a booth. 
,,,,,"I got the corn beef hash bowl which comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Well, since they have pancakes in their name, this was a no brainer. Plus, I always like a little sweet with my savory. "
,,,,,The bowl came in a cool looking tin that was filled to the brim. Lots of hash browns and two over easy eggs. Plenty of fresh green peppers provided some contrast to the saltiness of the rest. A little light on meat (or the pieces were just too shredded) causes the loss of a star.  
,,,,,Really close if you're planning a bean visit in Grant Park. Cheers!
,,,,,"Here is an example of how to get it right when you open post-covid. At 8:30 am, it was crowded with many people waiting. There was an organized system in place and once you were seated, very competent wait staff. Emily, our waitress, did an excellent job. "
,,,,,"The food was worth the wait - beware, portions are large. The pancakes are well worth trying. This was a great choice for a Sat morning breakfast!"
,,,,,Everything was delicious! Huge portions. Great food. There is a bit of a wait - always - and a huge wait on holidays and weekends. Totally worth it to me though
,,,,,"I had a goat cheese omelette with bacon here and it was delicious, the coffee drinks are fun and yummy as well. I would totally recommend if passing by and needing breakfast. Just be prepared for a lot of food and a decent wait. The wait does use a text based system so you can walk around and enjoy the city while you are waiting to be sat."
,,,,,A great breakfast spot in Chicago and it's right across from Millennium Park. Given it's location it was busy but we got seated right away and received our food in a timely manner. Our server was nice and attentive. 
,,,,,The los altos eggs Benedict has chorizo sausage and it was so good! It reminded me of tacos in breakfast form. The cinnamon roll pancakes were good too but they were just a tad drying once we got halfway through. The portions were generous and the pricing was fair. I would definitely come back if I ever go back to Chicago!
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Unfortunately, I order the special sweet corn and avocado Benedict and it was not good- I do not recommend it.  The corn cakes are dense and lack flavor and read the description because it doesn't include avocado. "
,,,,,My daughter ordered the Thai chicken salad and she liked it. 
,,,,,The server was nice.
,,,,,"What a popular spot for the office crowd, tourists and the local residents (although many leave for the winter) alike. "
,,,,,"It's tough to get a big table for breakfast but once you do, the service is friendly and efficient. They've got a bunch of carb filled breakfast choices and tempting skillets. Their over easy eggs are always just right!! I would try their OJ, although I'm not sure if it's fresh squeezed?? Finally, save room for the pancakes, whipped buttah and syrup - so fluffy, soft and warm on the inside. "
,,,,,"You'll definitely have leftovers, that's for sure. Make sure to walk off your meal by going to the Art Institute and the Bean."
,,,,,Must go! I went twice in my visit to Chicago of 4 days 
,,,,,"THE PLACE: We only visited this Wildberry location, since it was close to our hotel (see my review on that). But both times we visited,were good and the hosts were great. "
,,,,,"On our first time, we were sat immediately (Thursday 9am-ish), our waiter was patient, well-informed, attentive and sweet. Our second time around (Sunday 11am), we waited out in the cold for about 30-40 mins. We sat outside and our waiter was very kind and sweet, but he messed our orders and bills a few times. But I think we was just overwhelmed with the day. "
,,,,,"THE FOOD: For both visits, the food was A1! For my first visit I had the Fresca omelet with mushrooms, the portion was huge, the fruit was fresh and the pancakes were good! On my second visit, the manager gave us a season special menu as well, and that where I ordered the ground turkey chili omelet, which was amazing, cornbread was the best I've ever had and the fruit and pancakes were just as good as the first time. For both visits, my friend got the butcher block, which was very hardy,stayed warm the entire meal and was delicious. Ah! and their hot cocoa, simply delightful!!!"
,,,,,"THE SERVICE:  Good overall, not major complaints :)"
,,,,,"Wildberry is always a brunch favorite when I'm in the city, and absolutely delicious to boot. I had the Wildberry orange juice and the grilled peach salad, which is a seasonal dish. The flavors were so good and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lighter brunch option. The salad itself was incredible featuring grilled peach, watermelon, prosciutto cooked crispy, feta cheese, and avocado all combined into a nutritious and wholesome meal. The service is amazing, but you typically will have to wait to get in, which isn't really a problem because they text you when your table is ready. It's definitely worth the wait, so if you're in the city check out this popular location. I promise that you won't be dissatisfied."
,,,,,This spot is great if you have a big appetite. Portions are very large. 
,,,,,I would recommend a side of Signature Berry Bliss pancakes to give you something sweet at the end of your meal. 
,,,,,Garden Skillet could've used more seasoning but was cheesy.
,,,,,I've had Wildberry on my list for a looooooong time. Just so happens that my friend visited me and was staying downtown. I used this as the perfect time for me and him to check out Wildberry. So the wait when I checked was 3 hours. Yup. But! Luckily you can put your name down online to save a spot in line. 
,,,,,  
,,,,,"I actually ended up being late to my reservation time because of train delays and thought I had lost my spot, but they clicked my name that I was here to put me on the second line to wait in for a table. After about 15 minutes (which I will gladly take over 3 hours!), we were seated. "
,,,,,"So, first of all, I had to get a chai latte because it is my favorite. It was deeeeliccciouuussss! I then decided to order the mushroom omelette. What's cool about the pancakes (because of course you have to try the pancakes if you go to Wildberry pancakes), is that you can sub specialty pancakes for your side for only a couple of bucks more. Well I got the blackberry key lime pie pancakes. Let me tell you...these pancakes were so. darn. tasty! I usually don't like too much of really sweet foods, but these pancakes had a perfect key lime flavor! The blackberries just made them that much more amazing! I will say that I didn't even need syrup, because they are quite sweet enough on their own. "
,,,,,"My omelette was very fresh and savory. I was happy with my choice. Service was great and friendly. Overall, it was a great time at Wildberry. Definitely worth the wait...and then the second wait. :)"
,,,,,We were in town for the weekend and saw that this place had great reviews and constantly looked busy so we wanted to give it a try. The wait for us was about an hour which was just enough time to go check out Millennium Park and The Bean which is conveniently located across the street. We got the Signature Berry Bliss waffles and Corned Beef Benedict. The waffles definitely stole the show and perfectly hit our waffle cravings! The food came out very fast as well- this place is definitely worth the wait.
,,,,,"What an amazing eatery. Our first time to Chicago. I loved, loved, loved it. I couldn't even eat it all."
,,,,,Great restaurant! We came to this location after having a great experience at the location on Pearson. We walked here from our hotel and found it right across the street from Millenium Park. Cool spot! We were seated right away and got a table between two other couples. 
,,,,,"Our sever, Jeremy, told us how fast he was, and said things like ""savage"" and ""this is happening right now"" and was quite a character. Memorable for sure! He was excellent and very attentive! I ordered the Cinnamon Toll French Toast and my wife got the regular pancakes with a ton of syrup. They both came out really fast and we were digging in right away. The French toast was great, but not as tasty as the Berry Bliss flavor. We both remarked that we enjoyed the Pearson location better, but not because there was anything wrong with this visit. Great food and great service!"
,,,,,I am a sucker for goat cheese on omelettes but this was the first time I had caramelized onions in my omelette and I would like to say it added an extra taste of oomf to it I was impressed... for the pancake it was a bit over sweet but that was my fault I should've asked for the drizzled sauce on the side jus because it was a bit too much for me and lastly I had a iced vanilla latte with almond milk and loved it... the location is pretty big and it's jus a few min away from the famous bean
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"All hype. Long lines and very poor quality. Ordered a salad. Didn't have avocado as advertised, didn't have grilled peaches. The Salad was the "" Grilled Peach Salad"" what the heck. When I got the fruit it was awful. I really wanted to be impressed, disappointed."
,,,,,"My favorite brunch place. If you plan to go over the weekend, definitely join the yelp waitlist, and be prepared to wait after you received the text as well. Sometimes you suddenly receive a text message saying your position is up and either you show up in 5 minute or then remove you from the list. Try to get there as fast as you can. They don't really remove your name if you show up soon after 5 minutes are up, your name will just show up above the current list. "
,,,,,"If you don't join the waitlist, you could wait for  3 hours. In that case, remember there is another location at water tower."
,,,,,"My favorites are Fresca Omelettes with chicken sausage, the Barbados Chilaquiles, and the ""signature berry bliss"" (if you want light, then the crepes, if you want heavy, then thE waffles). Also the strawberry mango smoothies is the best if you like sweet drinks."

,,,,,Wildberry is a must have for breakfast in Chicago. It is worth the wait every time! I prefer this location over the one by the water tower! I like the views from out door seating at this location as it is right across the street from millennium park. The food is an instant 5 stars as the quality does not change among the restaurant neither does the service. They will not disappoint in either of those areas. The wait here is just through the roof usually but it is definitely worth the wait. This is a must go if you read my reviews!
,,,,,"Jus good food, service is punctual and they don't cheat you on the serving really decent."
,,,,,"I came here last time I was in Chicago, but didn't leave a proper review, so I made it a point to stop by here again and give it a long overdue review."
,,,,,"Food: I subconsciously ordered the same thing (Brisket hash w Pancakes) last time I went and this time. I also ordered a Wildberry Orange Juice this time around. The brisket hash was delicious; the egg was cooked to my tasting, the brisket was fresh and well-seasoned, and the hash browns and peppers underneath did a good job of mixing up and adding to the overall taste. The Wildberry Orange Juice tasted insanely fresh; the only time I've had orange juice taste like this was when I went to my friend's house and he made fresh squeezed OJ out of his oranges he grew. I also tried my friend's Banana Coconut Cream Pancakes, and those tasted great. "
,,,,,"Service/Environment: I HIGHLY recommend checking yourself into the wait list on Yelp for this place, otherwise you're going to be waiting for at least an hour on the weekends. The service is pleasantly fast and attentive, especially considering how much hustle and bustle is going on in the restaurant. The restaurant itself is decently spacious and host larger parties if necessary, but as mentioned before, you really need to put yourself on the wait list before getting to the restaurant itself if you don't want to wait too long."
,,,,,"Price: The final bill amounted to around $20 dollars per person with tax and tip. For the quantity and quality of food that we got for this price point, I thought it was pretty fair. "
,,,,,"Overall: If you're in Chicago during breakfast time, this is definitely the place to hit up. Just make sure to put yourself on the wait list first before coming!"
,,,,,Sour Host. Love the Wildberry in Schaumburg so we stopped by this one today. We asked if we can have a different table away from the kitchen and they took 15 mins to come back to ask if we wanted to be moved.  One of the male hosts' disposition was less than professional towards us which was disappointing since we love the food. And it was such a simple ask. We won't be going to this location again.
,,,,,How does a bustling restaurant garner over 7K reviews and STILL check in with 4.5 Yelp! stars? Because they *deserve* those stars!!
,,,,,"It was Sunday and after 1:30. After a morning of art-ing at the museum just down the avenue, my partner looked to me for a plan to satisfy her hangry-ness. I knew that loving look and hopeful tone of voice, so with just a few taps on Yelp!, I found Wildberry just a few blocks away, though it was due to close in just under 20 minutes. Always intrepid, I used the option to get in queue for the restaurant through Yelp!, and figured that we could walk the few blocks while we waited our time in line. Again, it was near closing, so I guessed that some of those in front of us in queue had probably given up hope of dining on those sweet pancakes and savory sandwiches as offered by Wildberry's menu. And I was right: within two blocks, we were tagged to be seated. "
,,,,,"We made it just as they were about to close their doors to new diners and were greeted as warmly as any other customer. They could have given us the silent eyeroll of 'really, we're about to close and we've been here since 6:00, and NOW you come in?', but they didn't. From hostess to server, everyone was exceptionally courteous. But you aren't here for my stories, are you?"
,,,,,"You want to know about the *pancakes*, and I can only tell you that I can't do them literary justice. You simply MUST try them for yourself. I opted for the Signature Berry Bliss stack, which was five fluffy cakes with a fresh berry medley and a sweet creme anglaise drizzled about. Yeah, I made a ridiculously fine choice. My partner went more classic and just did blueberry pancakes, and she was in heaven. She had blueberries inside the pancakes (duh) and a generous supply of berries riding shotgun to her cakes. Both of us were over the moon at the flavor and fluffiness of our stacks and we were furiously trying to figure out what the extra-something was in those cakes! Vanilla? Some other extract? A flavoring? What is that secret, we must know! Or don't tell us and we'll just come back again some time and try to pinpoint it for ourselves! P.S. I like the second idea better."
,,,,,"Pricing is pretty Loop standard, and for the portion size, the experience, and the quality, Wildberry could charge double and I wouldn't argue. Their fare is just that good. The space is easily filled and the staff was off the hook fantastic. Add in a grab & go coffee option just inside the door and this is a downtown Chicago hunger slayer. Don't let lines scare you away - all good things come to those who wait!"
,,,,,"Really good coconut ice coffee! I loved the signature bliss, a yummy cream cheese spread and good service."
,,,,,Great food and wonderful service. Long lines so make reservations or get there before you get hangry.
,,,,,"I was impressed with the service. They were attentive and seated us well before the quoted time (35 mins on a Friday morning, which is reasonable). Where they lost me was the food quality. I ordered pumpkin bread French toast, which came out room temperature (not hot, as preferred). It was fairly dry, and although the taste was decent, I didn't finish it because I wasn't enjoying it (I normally eat all my food). Same comment with my side dish, scrambled eggs. They were not hot but rather room temperature and very average taste. "
,,,,,"Although their processes seemed really dialed in, their main product is food, which was lackluster. "
,,,,,With so many other breakfast options in Chicago I wouldn't go back.

,,,,,You have to get the red velvet French toast! Breakfast will never be the same.Best breakfast ever! You have to get the red velvet French toast! It is to die for! Worth the wait!
,,,,,"I won't say much because the amount of reviews really speak for it. You have to be patient, put your name on the list and wait. We waited for about an hour for Saturday brunch which is a decent amount of time. Once we were seated, they are very efficient with taking your order and getting our food. I even admired their hustle to quickly clean up when I saw others leave their table, another party was quickly seated. "
,,,,,The food is stellar and creative: brisket hash and fluffy pancakes of wonderful varieties. It was difficult to decide what to get.
,,,,,Loved this establishment due to their numerous gluten free options!  My boyfriend and I had the best experience here and that's rare for us to say when we visit from Las Vegas. Thanks to the friendly staff for answering our questions and having such a quick service! When I visit Chicago I will definitely visit this location again.
,,,,,The only downside was the 50 minute wait but it was worth it.  The service was fast once we got a table.  The food and coffee was yummy!
,,,,,"This place was so busy, but so professional, welcoming, and fast! Awesome customer service. Our waiter was Emily L. She always checked in often even though this restaurant was crazy packed. The food was amazing. Got the Denver skillet, chocolate banana waffles, wild berry pancakes. I'll definitely be back and tell everyone about this place!"
,,,,,"After visiting a few times, I TOTALLY get the wait and the hype here, and think it is well-deserved. We used the Yelp wait-list function to secure a spot in line, and waited around 10 minutes only after we got to Wildberry. "
,,,,,"Food: AMAZING. You can't go wrong with anything here, but we (and most other people) got pancakes and skillets, which were SO good and comfortable. The portions are also huge. My friend and I finished 1.5 dishes and packed the rest home."
,,,,,"Service: AMAZING. Every single person, from the hosts at the front to our waiter and servers were so nice. There were a ton of people crowded in the front entryway, and the hosts were extremely professional and courteous, and informed people of alternate spaces to wait. Our waiter was so, so nice as well and anticipated our needs even before we asked for extra plates, take home boxes, more coffee, etc."
,,,,,Really glad we braved the cold to come here! This should be on everyone's brunch list.
,,,,,Always a difficult choice with such an extensive menu but can never go wrong with the cinnamon roll pancakes!!
,,,,,This place is amazing! The wait wasn't long; they are abiding by CDC guidelines. I felt comfortable throughout the dine. The food was delicious! 
,,,,,From Florida with love
,,,,,"Delicious! This was the first place we went when we got into town and it was a great place to start. It was extremely busy (1+ wait) on a Sunday at 10am. But, it was worth the wait. "
,,,,,I got French toast and it was yummy and very filling. I was not a fan of the chicken sausage. The hash browns and coffee were ok. 
,,,,,My wife got the Bahn Mi Sandwich off of the seasonal menu and loved it.

,,,,,This spot is definitely not a tourist trap!!!
,,,,,"This place has a great reputation in the city.  I've eaten here a few times before and the food was great, but it's been a few years.  I went back today and took some out-of-town friends for breakfast.  A bit disappointed, the presentation was just ok. The quality has gone down a bit.  My friends ordered chicken and waffles and I was surprised to see the chicken was the equivalent of frozen chicken nuggets on top of the waffles.  YIKES! I was a bit embarrassed to say the least, but they were gracious and ate it anyway.  Hmmmm......"
,,,,,"Two years later and still loved it as much as the last time. The wait was down due to current events and we got in right away, sitting outside was lovely and they look so many great precautions for masks and social distancing. Very pleased!"
,,,,,"Worth the wait, which I don't often say. You will wait a loonnng time, but plan to get your name on the wait list and walk around the park. "
,,,,,"The fresca omelet was delicious, hashbrowns perfect and the pancakes were very cake like. "
,,,,,Lots of food great value and great eats. A win for us.
,,,,,Okay the line during covid was not worth it at all.... but I know they do yelp waitlist usually and I can see that being worth it but I'm just not down to wait an hour and a half for a very normal menu 
,,,,,Didn't blow me away in any way 
,,,,,It was a good yummy breakfast but I don't get all of crazy hype 
,,,,,Maybe go to the less busy one? 
,,,,,There's never a time that this place isn't super busy 
,,,,,"Got my order wrong, waitress tried to blame me, but she quickly fixed it and I always appreciate that"
,,,,,Really enjoyed this Breakfast spot! We were in town for a conference and Wildberry was just around the corner. Got there around 8am and had no wait...glad we got there when we did because within the next 30 minutes it was crowded. Enjoyed their signature pancakes. That order is huge and I'd be surprised if one person could eat it all. I suggest splitting the order if you can. Ordered the breakfast burrito and a couple of coffees as well. The Kitchen got the orders out fast and our coffee cups were full. Great breakfast option if you are near!
,,,,,"Visiting from California, Bay Area! Hands down thee best Wildberry pancakes ever! Every layer is decked with wild berry sauce and berries. So flavorful and so scrumptious. I love every detail in the pancakes. This has to be hands down the best ever!"
,,,,,"Ordered Egg Benedict and it was good, just okay. The ham was a little chewy but the sauce was yummy. I've tried better else where but I'll definetly recommend their signature pancakes."
,,,,,"This place was amazing! From the hosts to the wait staff. Everything including the drinks were delicious. The fresh fruit, the quality ingredients. I can see why this place is so popular!"
,,,,,"Wildberry is a Chicago classic and for good reason! Their menu offers anything you could possible want for brunch, with the promise that everything is delicious."
,,,,,"Wait was about 30 minutes in a Sunday morning which isn't terrible. We were able to give a phone number then wander off knowing they'd text when the table was ready and we as able to check our place in line when we wanted. I got the two eggs meal with upgraded pancakes to the Signature Berry Bliss. Eggs were good, fruit was fresh, turkey bacon wasn't the greatest so I'd probably order sausage or something next time for that. Pancakes were great but a little too much for me. I would've liked them with just the fruit and not the extra icing type add on. Had the seasonal pumpkin latte with almond milk and it was perfect. Also tried the black currant tea, but I think I had too many sweets going on that overpowered the tea."
,,,,,"Friendly staff and extensive menu. Be aware, very large portions. We could have shared one brunch item and still been completely satisfied!"

,,,,,"This was a great spot for a busy Saturday morning as there is a lot of seating, they have a lot of staff, and they served food quickly. We didn't wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated outside at around 9 am, even though there were a lot of people waiting. The food was really great, and so was the service. The seasonal special of Sweet Corn and Avocado Eggs Benedict was a favorite (those sweet corn fritters - yum!) and the cinnamon roll pancakes are really sweet and delicious. Good portions, good food - a great spot in Chicago."
,,,,,"Arrived on a Monday morning around 8 am and had no wait. Ordered the signature berry pancakes and mushroom omelet. The pancakes were delicious. The omelet was great also, and a large portion."
,,,,,"So good, crepes amazing, service spectacular, the kind of waitstaff that will listen and interact without seeming like they have all those other tables to serve at all!"
,,,,,"Absolutely great service! Very attentive but at all the right times. Server was always there when we needed something and promptly delivered it to our table (water, extra napkins etc). Food was fresh, hot and delicious! Zero complaints"
,,,,,They got us in within 10 minutes on labor day at 9:30. The coffee was good and they were very cleanly. The Rutherford omelette was definitely amazing but the cinnamon roll pancakes were nothing to write home about. Also the chicken and waffles the chicken was definitely pre-frozen chicken which kind of ruins the dish. Overall it was a four because of all the other options on the menu-  we would  definitely try it again.
,,,,,"We there at about noon time on a rainy week day. Still have to wait for about 15 min. It's well worthy. Everything here is awesome. Order away, can't go wrong."
,,,,,This place is overrated. The food is good but is not worth waiting in line. You could get similar quality food with a lot less wait time in nearby restaurants.
,,,,,"This place was so delicious! Went with family and it was outside seating only when the weather was gorgeous. The line was very long and we waited about ~40 minutes to be seated (hence the 4 star vs 5), I wish you could call ahead or join a help waitlist. Additionally parking around the area on the weekends is tough - we drove around about 7 times before finding something. All in all , the wait was worth the service and food. Our server was a lot of fun and had such a great personality, made our experience all the better"

,,,,,Their basic coffee was also great. 
,,,,,Get there early to avoid a wait!
,,,,,Wow wow wow! #1 place must go for breakfast/ brunch in the downtown area! The have such a variety of food - sweets and savory!

,,,,,"Great food , great service! Portions are extremely generous. Food comes out super feast. Well recommend"
,,,,,"Service was so so. Nothing to rave about. Food was ok. Hash brown's were super greasy.  Way way too many onions, was like a 3 to 1 ratio of onions to hash. Lol."
,,,,,"Neither of us were impressed and once we got the highly over priced bill, super not impressed.  Have found better in Chicago 4 sure."

,,,,,I was in Chicago for my birthday and wanted a great breakfast spot to start my day. Yelp had great reviews of this restaurant so I decided to try. It was a great choice! There was so much food. I had the Mexicana skillet with a side of pancakes and could not eat it all. It was really good and when I'm back in the Chi this will be a stop on my list.
,,,,,This place is scrumptious.  The chicken and biscuit is .  The brisket and eggs is also amazing.  The coffee was good.  It wasn't Starbucks but it was good.
,,,,,"Fantastic Food, many super cool options for many different types of diets. The waiter was extremely friendly and proactive in letting patrons know what was in certain dishes and offered us to go coffees at the end of the meal. Busy busy busy, but totally worth it."
,,,,,Great stuff! Huge and delicious portions! 
,,,,,"Yes, it's busy during weekends but totally worth it"
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Literally one of the best places hands down to have breakfast. May require a lengthy wait time but i guarantee it's definitely worth it!
,,,,,Super fast service in the patio with huge portion sizes. We shared a skillet hash and upgraded to the berry blitz pancake. Great views of the park too as a bonus!
,,,,,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon and it was about a 15 minute wait. It was super packed but I didn't realize Lollapalooza was this weekend. The coffee was good, the skillet was good and the pancakes were okay. They could've been a little fluffier and were a little dry but overall good food! I would return again, the menu is expansive."
,,,,,Went on a Saturday morning and was seated very quickly! Service was also very quick and portion sizes were huge. The skillet with carnitas was amazing!
,,,,,One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! Was in Chicago Visiting playing golf with some old army buddies over 35 years and went here for breakfast on my last morning before heading to the airport!The red velvet French toast goes on my top 3 of all time! Loved it and will be at the top of my list to go back to every time I go back to Chicago!
,,,,,Pretty good for the most part aside from the price. Wait time was spot on waiting less than 10 minutes considering the place was packed. Wouldn't go again but definitely worth a try
,,,,,The long wait was worth it. Everything that I ate was absolutely delicious . I can't wait to visit again . By the time we made it in it was almost time for closing . Our waiter was nice and patient and very accommodating  we did not feel rushed at all.
,,,,,Excellent food and service. A great selection of food and large portions. We had the specialty pancakes...pumpkin and the chocolate chip banana. The Denver skillet was hearty and good. We went here twice over a four day stay in Chicago. Definitely a place to visit.
,,,,,Amazing place for breakfast! It's a must when visiting Chicago. The wait is long make sure you get there before you are starving. Other than that amazing place and amazing food.
,,,,,"This our second trip to the Windy City and the trip would not be complete without a trip (or 2) to Wildberry! We were greeted very warmly by our server, Sarah who was amazing from start to finish! We chose The Rutherford omelet which was great! Imagine 3 large eggs wrapped around fresh spinach, caramelized onions, bacon and goat cheese! One of the best omelets ever. The pancakes never disappoint either. We shared the omelet, cinnamon roll pancakes and banana pecan pancakes. Don't go to Chicago without trying Wildberry!"
,,,,,"Wildberry is a fabulous option for upscale breakfast and lunch in Chicago. We were in the city 4 days and ate at Wildberry twice. Both times were amazing! My wife had the egg and bacon breakfast with banana pancakes with pecans which she enjoyed. I had the egg and bacon breakfast as well, but our server recommended the cinnamon roll pancake. This was over the top wonderful. Buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon chips inside and drizzled with a cinnamon cream cheese glaze (think Cinnabon)! The second day we tried the Belgian Waffle which was devious as well. Crispy outside and light inside. Another great meal.They have a variety of Skillet breakfast options which sounded great too. Inside and outdoors/ patio dining are both offered. Delicious coffee and great service. Very popular, so be prepared to wait. Not everyone that sells breakfast does it well. Wildberry does it exceptionally well! We will be returning when we come back to Chicago!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,The s'mores pancakes were delicious! I would recommend the veggie skillet as well!
,,,,,The only thing I would say is to come early if possible. We had to wait 45 minutes outside before we could come in because we arrived at 11am!
,,,,,"The the signature berry bliss pancakes are scrumptious, the southwest wrap with fries is delicious and the iced hazelnut latte the right balance of flavor and sweetness. Had a great experience food and our server was friendly and kind!"
,,,,,but hosting service could be a bit better when it comes to the rules of being seated and placing an order only after all guests have arrived. A little flexibility is greatly appreciated
,,,,,"We walked over to this breakfast restaurant. We got there around 7:50am on Saturday morning. We got right in the door and sat down, however when we left it looked as though there was a pretty substantial wait starting. After eating here, I understand why. The food quality is great. I had the two egg breakfast and upgraded the pancakes to specialty ones. Everything tasted amazing. The best surprise was the iced tea. I ordered the black tea and it had a hint of maybe lavender. It was the best restaurant iced tea I have had in a while. The service was great and I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a tasty breakfast."
,,,,,"Wait is ridiculously long they don't go by who arrived first. Waited over 50 mins for a table for two while they took large parties, and parties that just seemed to be arriving. I checked for a ""wait in line"" list  and didn't find one. They seat according to table availability so you have a better chance of getting seated quicker if you have a large party. Otherwise prepare to wait in the blaring sun ( or whatever extreme chicago weather the day has) for nearly 1 hour. They used to text you when your table was ready , so you could walk around or wait inside prudential plaza, and now you're forced to wait in close proximity. Once they do call out your name , they barely give you a chance to walk up to them when they are already shouting out ""last call""."
,,,,,I love love breaskfast here. The pancakes and omelettes are delicious. My only complaint is the service. Our server was a little arrogant. The wait times are crazy and for the over one hour wait times the staff should at least treat guests politely.
,,,,,"Some of the best breakfast foods I've ever had! I went every morning for 3 days and could easily see myself staying longer or doing it again. Most meals are in large portions, and everything was delicious! The crepes that I had tasted a bit more like eggs than I was expecting, but apart from that, I had no issues with my food. Also, the waiting time was never more than about 15 minutes and the staff is wonderful. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Chicago!"
,,,,,"Amazing dinning experience! The best service hands down.  The hostess was so friendly and accommodating, our waitress was friendly, fast and brought to go cups for our unfinished lattes.  "
,,,,,"I had the gluten free key lime pancakes, you wouldn't know they were gluten free! So good.  The lattes were prefect temperature and so good."
,,,,,My second time coming here and I definitely recommend trying this place. The prices are reasonable and also come here early because there's usually a wait.
,,,,,"I don't like leaving negative reviews so I'll just say that food was average and not worth the 2 hour wait. Ordered the 12 hour brisket which was kinda chewy and didn't taste like it was cooked for 12 hours. Berry pancakes were ok. The atmosphere was chaotic, felt rushed, like they couldn't wait for you to leave. No mimosas. They don't do open table reservations. Save yourself 2 hours and eat at yolk or Roanoke in 20 minutes. You can Thank me later"
,,,,,"I have heard enough reviews to decide my 1st brunch in Chicago would be the one! First off, this place is super popular! Do not I mean do not assume you will get a spot as soon as you go. I had to wait about 45 minutes on sunday to check in at 12. I did feel it was pretty decent wait time. Weather was great, so waiting out and walking around millennium park and the bean was fun. We were escorted as soon as we were notified. Outdoors and beautiful views - i was taken already. Ordered eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce, roasted red peppers and spinach. The hollandaise sauce was lit!! Creamy, flavorful and the right amount of saltiness. The portions are huge, you can definitely eat dinner and lunch with that size. Then ordered the famed berry pancakes. Did NOT, I repeat did not disappoint, fluffy cake like texture pancakes with creamy berry drips between each layer. I was full and happy. Must visit if in Chicago!"
,,,,,"We came here and put our name in for 6 people for brunch on a beautiful Saturday morning and were seated within 15 minutes! Our waiter, Michael, was great! Honestly the best service we had in Chicago. He was friendly, checked on us, and quick with everything. You could tell they were trying to get everyone they wanted to eat there in but they didn't rush you at all. The food was 10/10 I got the Florence eggs Benedict and it was so delicious. Definitely a great brunch spot with walking distance to the bean that I would recommend!"

,,,,,What a nightmanre.   Ordered the food and it never showed up. No knock on the door or ringing of the door bell.  The drive must be a idiot
,,,,,Customer service though Grab hub was not better.  Stick to Uber Eats or DoorDash.   They at least try and help situation.   This lady literally told me to kick rocks.
,,,,,I'm done will stick wine uber eats and Grubhub in smduyr
,,,,,"We were seated within 10 minutes at 8am on Sunday. I had the corned beef skillet and my husband had the butcher block skillet. Both were wonderful! He was able to finish his, but I only managed about half of mine. The wildberry jam is really amazing. We had great service from Sarah! This is where we go for breakfast when we are downtown and only 5 blocks from the beginning terminus of Route 66!"
,,,,,"Wildberry was very busy but the service was very quick making for an efficient dining experience. We had the berry bliss pancakes and the eggs and minced ham. The pancakes were stacked high, fluffy and had a great berry flavor. The eggs were good and paired great with hash browns and toast on the side. The price was a bit steep but we would recommend giving them a try for a good breakfast spot in the city."
,,,,,"This place is legit. Some of the best breakfast I've had. The service was great, attentive, and very friendly. We went during covid times and they did a great job of social distancing, people wearing masks, and service outdoors was just as comfortable as it would be indoors. "
,,,,,"We got the mexicana skillet with a side of their berry bliss on the side( for a small price upgrade) , but it provided the best sweet/savory combination. We also got the banana cream pie crepe as recommended from our waiter, and it was legit."
,,,,,Will mos def come back here when visiting Chicago
,,,,,"It was even better that it was right next to the bean. So not only were we able to eat, but we could do all the touristy stuff right after."
,,,,,Had the skillet chicken base and it was delicious and enough to feed two. Berry bliss pancakes are amazing !
,,,,,Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe is a hugely popular restaurant. We visited on a slow day and still waited 35 minutes for a table. It turned out to be a very enjoyable experience and well worth the wait. 
,,,,,"After my husband and I were seated things moved quickly. I ordered the Espanola Omelet. It was made with jalapeños, chorizo, mushrooms, onions, cilantro and Chihuahua Cheese on a bed of corn tortillas. After my first bite I decided that this was the best omelet that I have ever tasted. There was something about the combination of flavors and freshness that hit it out of the park. The omelet was large so I could not eat the load of breakfast potatoes that came as a side. It also came with a pancake that I upgraded with blueberries. There pancakes are delicious. "
,,,,,My husband ordered the eggs Benedict and loved them. He also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy that taste amazing.
,,,,,I have to say this place rocks my socks off I've been here twice in my life and I can't say anymore you guys are the best in the city of Chicago you do great work great food great company and great service I told my friends that if you ever in Chicago must come to this place it's a do or die for. i admire  that you guys craft such great food. i'll be back for more one of these days every time I wonder to think about what's a good place for breakfast I always think of you guys. I mean there was a lot of great breakfast spot in Chicago and a lot of great food but it's hard to choose what you want to do but I say you guys a top-notch are keep up the good work.
,,,,,"Service started rocky after quickly getting a table, then turned around. Great food, delicious drinks, clean and practicing social distancing. Highly recommend"
,,,,,"Fairly impressed after my visit here. Found this place on Yelp and was immediately interested after going through the pictures. When we arrived I was discouraged by the amount of people waiting outside. But the wait wasn't that long roughly 30 minutes. They have ample seating indoors and outdoors. Let me tell you, the food was amazing. My friend had the eggs Benedict and it was so much food and they loved it. I had the regular two egg breakfast and the eggs and bacon was cooked perfectly. They even have a house made wild berry jam that was the perfect sweetness. My fiancé had the Nutella crepe. They give you three huge crepes. Definitely worth the price."
,,,,,"I LOVE Wildberry Pancakes. I come to this location every time I'm in Chicago. It's right across from Millennium Park. I usually order anything with the signature berry bliss. It's delicious. I've gotten the pancakes, french toast, and crepes with the signature berry bliss sauce. The coffee is strong and orange juice is fresh. I also ordered a side of sausage patties once and that was really good too."

,,,,,Perfect breakfast/brunch place! The food is extremely tasty and the portions here are ginormous so come ready to eat!
,,,,,"Extremely overpriced for the amount and quality of food, like everything is $17-19. Insane. The chicken and waffles were cold and the chicken tasted like cardboard. Only thing that was decent were the pancakes but that didn't make the experience worth it."
,,,,,Friends and family all insisted that I check this place out. Breakfast is a big deal and always has been. Pancakes are a way to my heart. If you can make some great quality buttermilk pancakes-then you have a friend for life. 
,,,,,We expected a bit of a wait due to the amount of people standing outside. No problem-we are willing to wait to to experience this cafe that everyone has been raving about. Our wait was over an hour for inside seating- we preferred indoors due to how cold and a chance of rain. We finally decided to just sit outside after an hour of waiting and we were still 6-8 tables away from being seated inside. 
,,,,,The hostess needs to seriously adjust the way she addresses people when they approach the podium. I get it-she must be overwhelmed due to how busy they were. That's no excuse to be rude to patrons waiting to dine at the establishment she works at. 
,,,,,Took 10 min to be greeted by our server after finally being seated and another 5-7 before our coffee arrived. 
,,,,,Pancakes were mediocre( hugely disappointed) but I'm willing to try it once more but I'll definitely won't be returning anytime soon for poor service and a long wait. Just my 2 cents
,,,,,"Extremely overrated, long wait for average ihop like food. Wishing the pancakes were an exception but they were not! Shake and bake pancakes!!"
,,,,,"We came in for breakfast before going to a football game at Soldier Field. They handled the large mob of people very efficiently and were able to get us in and out quickly. I had an omelette with hash browns, and the quality and quantity were very good. I would like to go back on a less busy day to experience a less hurried meal. Overall they did a great job, and I commend the staff for remaining pleasant during a stressful shift."
,,,,,"The food is always good. There's usually quite a wait on weekends. I've been here three times and two of the three times my food was extremely delayed. The staff and manager made up for the delay with drinks and a percentage off the bill but it's still quite annoying. If it wasn't for those two incidents I'd give this place 5 stars easily. The aesthetic are great, the staff is nice and professional & the food is great."
,,,,,Soooo delicious. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and Wildberry surpassed my expectations. Staff are very attentive and the wait post-ordering was less than 15 minutes. Everything was fresh and just as ordered. Still thinking about that Signature Berry Bliss French toast and Mexicana skillet (chorizo on the side).
,,,,,"When I worked in a building nearby this place, "
,,,,,It was like a ritual for me and my coworkers to group order here! 
,,,,,IT IS THAT GOOD. 
,,,,,Cant go wrong with the pancakes and I'm not even a big pancake fan
,,,,,Always filling and enjoyable experience! I always order one egg breakfast item and a sweet choice like their French toast with berries and cream..so delicious
,,,,,"I went all the way to Chicago just to eat here! Jk but I left Chicago feeling satisfied that I found a one of a kind restaurant that is simply perfect. I had the pleasure of eating here twice. The food was delicious, tasty, and filling. All I have left to say is I left my stomach in Chicago. -From a California Girl"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Underwhelmed. Reading the Yelp reviews I expected it to taste like homemade pancakes but they tasted like out of a box. The egg skillets were good but nothing special. Overall I felt this was a more generic brunch place than the hidden gem other reviews noted. Perhaps due to location it seems to stand out? But the service was excellent.
,,,,,This is a really good breakfast spot in Chicago. It's consistently amazing each time you go. We were a party of four arriving at around 10AM on a Saturday and our wait was only 15 minutes! They are only offering outdoor dining due to COVID and the tables are appropriately distanced from each other. The location is convenient if you're just visiting Chicago because it's right by Millennium Park. Overall a great experience!
,,,,,"We planned to go out to start our beautiful day with friends to try this restaurant together, but we are disappointed with the choice we made because the way they were treating people. It was super unprofessional, rude with a discriminatory attitude. I would never go back to this restaurant ever again."
,,,,,The waiter and the guy who was introduced as the manager by the waiter were fully disrespectful and impolite.
,,,,,"Also, my mask got lost and they didn't even have mask to provide, and I believe that's the most important thing that a restaurant needs to have to offer in these Pandemic"
,,,,,"Good food, quick service. "
,,,,,"Only downfall is wait time. It's hot for tourists. If you're cool with waiting, by all means it will be worth it. If you don't, then find quicker options."
,,,,,Good service. Good food! Breakfast burrito was really good! Cinnabon pancakes were my favorite!
,,,,,Terrible experience. Host acts like bouncer in night club. Ordered food for 5 but 5th guest was 10 min late and was not allowed to sit even when his eggs were ready on the table and the rest of us were just starting to eat. This is a TOURIST TRAP. Stay away.
,,,,,Visited from Arizona and our hotel recommended this breakfast place for us since the hotel restaurants were closed due to covid.
,,,,,We stayed downtown so it was a 30-45 minutes walk and was settled right across the road from
,,,,,"Millennial Park where the famous ""Bean"" sculpture was at. Now I knew this place was popular due to its reviews, but before we got to the front, it was already developing a line. My group of 4 were starving and they did have outdoor seating. For those from Arizona, the idea of sitting outside in 40 degree temperatures wouldn't be an option for us back home but it promised immediate seating if we opted for outside seating. We took it. "
,,,,,"Regardless, we didn't hold back on our food. Wildberry is known for their pancakes so we got one order for our table to share. We were told their berry mascarpone pancakes were their famous ones."
,,,,,"Even with the wind, and the sprinkling of rain, even Arizona locals found the food and service worth the outdoor seating!"
,,,,,"Awesome place, amazing breakfast! First time ever being in Chicago, and this was a great way to start the trip! Delicious!!"
,,,,,In a word:  YUM!
,,,,,"Divine food, outstanding service, reasonable prices.  The best of the best!"
,,,,,"A great place to take tourist friends or people visiting the city. Impeccable Location directly across the street from Millenium  park! I love their waffles or berry pankcakes! Service is always great, as is having it delivered via any delivery platform!"

,,,,,"I was curious what all the hype was about since we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, but it's pretty well deserved! The Florence Benedict was spectacular- the has brown was fluffy and crispy, the poached eggs were cooked and flavored beautiful, I would highly recommend checking out this brunch spot"
,,,,,Our server was so nice and attentive. I ordered the Eggnog French toast. I highly recommend this order. My friend had the pancakes and they looked fluffy and she said they tasted wonderful.
,,,,,Love the skillets and the pancakes. Wait time is average for location. Food is fresh and great! One of my favorite breakfast spots.
,,,,,The concierge at our hotel recommended this place for brunch.  The restaurant was super busy but it was definitely worth the wait. The fluffy pancakes were absolutely delicious!
,,,,,"Every time I go to Chicago, this my place for breakfast! Pancakes and French toast... amazing!!"
,,,,,Hands down one of the best breakfast spots in Chicago. I've eaten in store and from DoorDash and their food never disappoints. Their pancakes are light and buttery.  Everything we ate was delicious. They have a lot of options to choose from. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on their menu. You do want to get here extremely early to avoid the long lines. Its very popular and for good reason.
,,,,,"My twin sister and I came here for breakfast to celebrate our 23rd birthday. They do indeed celebrate birthdays, so we got a free red velvet-like cake thing that actually was a little stale. There was no singing by the staff, which is totally understandable because of COVID."
,,,,,"The food was really good. I had pancakes with a side of bacon and orange juice (that was a little on the warm side), my sister had French toast and her boyfriend had blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon and a strawberry banana smoothie. "
,,,,,"The wait was long, about 30min because they were packed. We visited the restaurant on June 20th and guests were only allowed to eat outside on their patio at this point. I am completely fine with that because social distancing and everything. They have umbrellas for each table which is nice because it started to drizzle at one point while we were eating. The only downside is it was still very hot and humid which is uncomfortable when you're eating but the restaurant obviously can't control that."
,,,,,I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking to safely eat out for breakfast or lunch.
,,,,,The one star is for the waiting list. They don't take reservations. The system they have sucks.
,,,,,"This is a decent breakfast place near Millenium Park, definitely a tourist trap. There was a lot of people outside and we thought it'd be a long wait, but surprisingly for a party of 5 we were seated within 5 minutes (lucky!) "
,,,,,We got a few dishes...
,,,,,- Slow Roast Brisket Hash 
,,,,,- Rustic Farm Egg Panini
,,,,,- Los Altos Benedict
,,,,,- Homemade Corned Beef Hash
,,,,,- Signature Berry Bliss
,,,,,"All the dishes were alright, nothing memorable. Very large portions, we probably should have ordered less and family-styled it. They were heavy and left us in a good coma."
,,,,,"The infamous Wildberry did not disappoint! I tried this out with some friends, and it was a great experience! The store maintained distancing and CDC guidelines by doing an outdoor set up. We waiting in line outside once we put our name down, but the wait was reasonable. We ordered a variety of egg hollindaise's and tried the cookies and cream pancakes. Everything was absolutely delicious and such a treat! The best part? We got to overlook Millennium Park during brunch!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Not that great, no worth the hype. Food was real dry and the service is messy. This place over all is messy. Save your money and go to huck finn"
,,,,,0/10 star delivery order. I selected Wildberry on Yelp and clicked order delivery as in the photo below. I placed my order and thought all was fine. I checked my email to realize it said my order was for pickup
,,,,,"I have tried calling the restaurant for the past 20 minutes and no one is answering. It's a Tuesday morning, the recording said they were open, I select front desk. There is no way for me to get this order fixed or refunded because there is no customer service at all. "
,,,,,I would go pickup the order but I'm in the hospital with my daughter and unable to leave as her guardian and it's good far to walk. Hopefully someone clears this up. Just makes me want to scream
,,,,,We did not eat here but instead placed an order for pickup. We were staying at The Palmer House at the time so it was a quick and easy walk to Wildberry and back. The site to order was extremely easy to navigate and order. Pick up was a breeze. I didn't have to wait. It also has Apple Pay so yay for that. The portions seemed big so for my kids (8 and 11 yrs) I got 2 sides of pancakes and an order of bacon. It was perfect for them. Husband ordered the seasonal Breakfast Bahn Mi. They were generous with the hash browns and he said it was fantastic and full of flavor. 
,,,,,I ordered the Summer Avocado Toast and to my shock scrambled eggs and avocado go wonderfully together. The corn gave it some nice texture to it as well. I can't wait to visit Chicago again and have another meal here.
,,,,,"We always go early to avoid a long wait. Not sure I would wait the hour, but breakfast is important and this place has always been consistent. Hot food is always cooked just right and carb portions are big (we always have leftovers)!! Wait staff is friendly and quick."
,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes continue to amaze their customers with their food, service and management. It's been a while since the last time I've been here. And this time, I felt the customer waitlist management has gotten even better. Though there was a wait (it's expected of a place with such a high rating in such a happening area), the wait for me was less than 40 minutes or so. And the best part is the only wait we had was to get a table. Once we had our table, the service was super fast and all of our food was served within 10-15 minutes. It was almost closing time and they mentioned that the kitchen orders have a hard stop at 1:45 PM. So, if you decide to go to this place, make sure you are there before 1 PM at least to be sure to fill your belly. The portions were huge and worth the wait and price. And there's not even a single word that's enough to describe how great their signature berry bliss pancakes are :)"
,,,,,"Good food, good service. I ordered the corn beef hash skillet it came with pancakes and it was pretty tasty. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys corn beef hash."
,,,,,We waited 30 minutes on a random Thursday morning and it was worth every minute!!! Everything tasted amazing. They have a really extensive menu. My husband got the cinnamon pancakes and I got the mixed berry pancakes! A+ and 5 stars!!!
,,,,,Great place for breakfast and brunch! Delicious pancakes. Place wasn't super busy and we were seated right away. Our server was very attentive. Place was clean and there was ample space between tables.
,,,,,"I was looking for a full breakfast menu and got it at Wildberry. The server warned us that because they're short handed that the orders could take a while but we got it fairly promptly. My wife did not think highly of the spinach Benedict but my southern Benedict was unusual and tasty with biscuit instead of English muffin, gravy instead of Hollandaise."
,,,,,The place was full and tables were not spaced in accordance with social distance.
,,,,,"The workers and managers here are very rude. We were waiting for 50 minutes for our table. When we asked how long was left they told us they had already called our name and we had to go back onto the start of the waitlist. Meanwhile, we were waiting right in front of the booth they were calling names from. When we explained that it was not possible that they called our names they called us liars. The front waitstaff quickly started yelling at us and the manager shouted at us with a microphone. They were racist and rude. Don't come here unless you want to be verbally berated by staff for a mistake they made."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,This place is delicious. I don't have any complaints. They have a lot to select from the menu
,,,,,"This place always seems packed, but now I realize that it's just a tourist trap with less than okay food. Would suggest adding alcohol options at the very least"
,,,,,"Friendly people, friendly service, accommodating, And even though they were completely swamped that day everything ran very smoothly."
,,,,,"Food was great, service was efficient and super friendly. The restaurant was busy (on a Tuesday morning/brunch) but service was so efficient we hardly had to wait and never had to flag down the waiter. There was a huge line to be seated by the time we left the restaurant (at 11 am) so try to go early if you want breakfast!"
,,,,,"Man do I miss this breakfast spot. While I no longer live in the Chicago area, I try to get back here for pancakes when I am visiting."
,,,,,"Virtually all of the different breakfast options I have tried over the years were delicious, but the specialty pancakes really stand out. Options such as s'mores or seasonal apple or pumpkin pancakes come out delicious every time. "
,,,,,"Pre-COVID, there was often a very long wait on weekends given how popular this place is, but if you like breakfast food, it is worth being patient!"
,,,,,Touristy at best. Next to the world famous bean. Staff was very friendly. Portions are generous. Plenty of outdoor seating. Food was decent. Nothing amazing. But better than Denny's. Willing to bet this place has high stars and a lot of reviews for location alone. Disappointed for such raving reviews on Yelp.
,,,,,This location sucks for numerous reasons 
,,,,,-Wait time much longer than stated when completed online wait list for 3 
,,,,,- Manager was completely unreasonable regarding above and had us waiting additional 40 minutes from 10:50 am text received. 
,,,,,-Service was terrible from waitress. We was seated and then waited additional 15 minutes for water & menus.
,,,,,- Another couple was seated and waited on immediately and there food was also given before ours. 
,,,,,- Food was remade once for me and one for my niece. While my sister food had to be made twice and was still wrong we just opted not not deal with the hassle of going back & forth. 
,,,,,The Schuamburg location was so much better a few days prior they deserved 5 stars Over there.
,,,,,"I live in California and visited Chicago about 2 weeks ago. We didn't know many places to eat at and that day we were starving. We walked by this cute red themed restaurant and decided to check it out. Our server was Marco and he was absolutely wonderful! Polite, attentive, well mannered and patient. He offered a cup for my coffee when we were ready to leave and that was great for me as I was trying to drink it fast so we could continue our adventure in downtown. So instead I was able to enjoy it on our walk. The food was delicious and perfect temp. Definitely a place I am coming back to when I visit once again!!"
,,,,,"Worth the wait if you have time! Close to attractions like the ""Bean"" and Millennium Park."
,,,,,Very popular place near Millennium Park. Wait was about 35-40 mins for outside seating (which was expected). I knocked down a star because there was a dead bird's decapitated head on the floor right next to my chair. 
,,,,,Food was delicious and rather fast for the amount of people there! Definitely will come again.

,,,,,Food is so fresh and this is my favorite breakfast to go every time I visit Chicago. 
,,,,,Once you order the food is ready in less than 10 mins
,,,,,They take seriously what customer service is and I love that. 
,,,,,"Never disappointed with the excellent of service, quality of food and cleanliness of the restaurant. "
,,,,,Highly recommended
,,,,,Wow - The Berry Bliss Waffles and the Chilaquiles were amazing. Small wait to get in but worth it!
,,,,,The food here was incredible. It was packed & I could see why. The service was fast & accurate. Definitely recommend this place for a nice breakfast before hitting the park across the street!
,,,,,"Great food and atmosphere. Be warned that the line gets long quickly, so aim to arrive ten minutes before open to make sure you score a table"
,,,,,"The 10 min wait time was worth it. Great service, pancake varieties. Decided to go with blue berry danish pancakes and tomato panini. Omelette might have been a better option than the panini. "
,,,,,Black coffee was just right. Dining environment was well setup. Social distancing guidelines also followed. Good breakfast destination.
,,,,,Excellent banana almond oatmeal and banana chocolate chip pancakes.  We were lucky and got seated quickly.  Will visit again.
,,,,,Majority of the food has way too much added sugar. It's more of dessert dresses up as breakfast. 
,,,,,"Hype and lines on weekends, not worth it. You're better off going to Mortar and Pestle in Lakeview or Longman & Eagle in Logan Square. "
,,,,,Drinks at Longman
,,,,,"Great food and service! Although they were busy and there was a wait, employees are kind and accommodating. Service was great once seated. Highly recommend."
,,,,,"Key Lime Blackberry Pancake - 5/5. So delicious. Once you let go of the ""key lime"" expectations part since that flavor doesn't get imparted at all, you can just enjoy this as a sweet incredible pancake."
,,,,,Garden Skillet - 4/5. Good if you're in the mood for a hash. Lots of veggies. Would consider the cauliflower hash option next time since potato does get to be a lot.
,,,,,"Churro french toast - 3/5. Whereas other items here like the banana bread french toast are better than normal banana bread, that's the not the case here. You just wish these were normal churros."
,,,,,Got pick-up so wasnt able to eat as fresh as ideal
,,,,,Cinnamon Roll Pancakes - 5/5. Emily loves these. 
,,,,,Blackberry Key Lime Pie Pancake - 4/5. Very strong. Lime flavor gets a bit lost but the blackberry is very nice. Surprisingly fruity flavor for a pancake. Two pancakes was a decent portion for $7.
,,,,,Banana Pecan Cream Pie Waffle - 3/5. Nice quality waffle and good basic combination but the cream part didn't hold up well in pick-up at least. OK but wouldn't get again.
,,,,,Delicious. Excellent service. Would be happy to go back.
,,,,,Banana Bread French Toast - 5/5. Banana bread is made first and then converted into French toast. Coached in chocolate and with fresh banana created a rich delicious result. 
,,,,,Special Wild berry Pancakes - 4/5. Really good syrups with a heaping pile of fresh fruit. But the pancakes themselves are decent but not special so the whole combo is good but totally dwarfed by the magic of the Banana bread French toast. I wish they'd give less pancakes since 6 is a ton.
,,,,,Wild berry juice - 4/5. Fresh but wish I just got normal fresh orange juice.
,,,,,Was not super impressed by this spot. The service was very quick and the server was good and attentive. The inside looks like your typical diner spot. I ordered the plain pancakes which were not very good. They almost tasted artificially flavored. They were also not nearly as fluffy as expected. Also had corned beef hash. The meat was well flavored and a large portion. The hash browns were a bit undercooked. Overall this place was not that good and unfortunately was disappointed.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,I can't explain how good the food and the service was here!! The view is perfect and refreshing and the food is an amazing accomplice to that. My friend got the omelette and said it was one of the best she's ever had. I got the classic Benedict and substituted the ham for bacon. It was so good! I definitely felt like it was a little dry so I ordered some extra Hollandaise and that did the trick. You need to come here and enjoy the entire experience!
,,,,,Awesomeness the best food ever. Always busy
,,,,,Always a good sign when you're from out of town.
,,,,,"I really liked this place and the decor, as well as the wait staff. Definitely recommend trying to get a reservation though! It's very popular and busy even on weeekdays for brunch. Enjoy!"
,,,,,"Wildberry has an incredibly expansive menu. They got pretty much any brunch item and drinks you can think of. However we have both dined in and ordered to go, and weren't really blown away and think there are plenty other brunch places in the city that offer a better value. "
,,,,,"I do think their sweet dishes are more impressive than the savory ones. The hash browns lacked flavor. We did really like the blackberry danish pancakes, and loved our lattes. The matcha lavender one was perfect."
,,,,,We ordered the Denver bowl and specialty pancakes. That alone split was enough for 2. If we ate that each we would be too full to go anywhere after. 
,,,,,Get their specialty coffee not the plain coffee. Well worth it
,,,,,"Wow, such a great breakfast place! When I read other reviews saying this place had the greatest pancakes, I was a bit skeptical, but it's true! I did have the best pancakes of my life here!"
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I ordered the Los Altos Benedict,  the kid's menu Berry Bliss pancakes, and the Two Eggs Any Style (scrambled) with regular pancakes. We really enjoyed everything we got! I didn't  realize it, but the berry bliss pancakes are blueberry pancakes with berries and a berry drizzle! Also, the portion sizes are quite large and they don't skimp on the meat, sauce, or berries! I am looking forward to trying more on their menu since it is pretty big and has lots to offer. "
,,,,,"While they are allowing dine-in right now, I chose to pick-up my order and eat at home. It was a seamless ordering and pick-up process, and my order was correct and ready on time. Everyone I interacted with was also very friendly and helpful. "
,,,,,10/10 you should try it if you're interested!
,,,,,"Visiting from Az, was looking for a good breakfast spot. Read reviews and it matched my expectations. "
,,,,,I ordered the Wildberry French Toast and a caramel latte. The French Toast was the best French Toast I have ever had. Great blend of berries and the sauce they used was the cherry on top. French toast cooked to perfection and the latte was phenomenal as well.
,,,,,I was super hungry coming here and was happy that the food was made quickly and deliciously! Was not disappointed. Even had leftovers for the plane!
,,,,,Definitely coming back here when I visit Chicago. Food was amazing  Not even in Ny I found a place so good like Wild-berry! Worth the prices. Service was great and quick.
,,,,,This place definitely lived up to the hype! With so many reviews on yelp we knew that it was a must visit! And they did not disappoint! The cinnamon roll pancakes are unlike anything we have ever had and they were absolutely delicious. Both of our skillet dishes were also full of flavor & very filling and we definitely did NOT leave hungry! The portions were large & delicious! We are so glad that we were able to make it in during our visit to Chicago and definitely will visit again whenever we come back to the city! **** completely worth the hour wait****

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"This place never disappoints! The best items on their menu are the sweet breakfast items like pancakes, crepes, etc. their egg options are pretty good too. Love their coffees/lattes, and juices. The employees are always so nice. "
,,,,,"I recommend going on  their waitlist, before coming into the restaurant. It's a very long line usually. Sometimes over an hour wait for a table, but it's worth it!"
,,,,,"What a big disappointment. We have had great food experiences in Chicago, and this breakfast place was extremely promising given the raving reviews on Yelp. Oh well, we might not be the target audience, but we found this cafe to be very low quality in many ways. To be clear, the Cafe was packed, so it clearly has lots of fans. But, the food underdelivered through and through. "
,,,,,"The avocado toast was probably one of the worst avocado toasts we have had in months. Ok, we are from California, I know, but even the ones we had in Iowa City a few days back or the one we had at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery here in Chicago were much, much better. The Napa fig omelette sounded so fancy that you can't really go wrong with that. However, it was way overcooked, plus the hash potatoes that came with it were completely tasteless. So much, that I can only guess that you were expected to eat with ketchup."
,,,,,"Onto the sweets... We asked for a strawberry and almonds french toast that we could barely eat. The bread was barely cooked in any way, and, again, the only way to make it eatable was to pour a lot of syrup on top."
,,,,,"Even the coffee was not very good, which is pretty crazy given that they supposedly serve Intelligentsia! I know that coffee pretty well and I even brew it at home. I can't even believe that is the same coffee we were having at Wildberry's."
,,,,,"I will end with the only positives I could find: (1) super extensive menu where you can find everything, from the classics to the fanciest sounding stuff, (2) big plates (we couldn't finish any of them although part of why is because we didn't like them)."
,,,,,Amazing place! All services 100% perfect since from hostess to waitress and the food is so delicious! 
,,,,,I really recommend!
,,,,,"OK I totally see what the hype is about. The food here is truly amazing. We came on a weekday at around two and still the way it was around 20 minutes, I can't imagine what it would be like on the weekend! Either way I hope to come back again because this place is really so good."
,,,,,Delicious & great staff! The food was out quickly and they have a good variety. Pancakes are worth the hype 100% recommend
,,,,,"I have to update my review! My second time now at Wildberry, and while I re-ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes because they are good , I switched it up and ordered the Barbacoa Chilaquiles Skillet. To my disappointment, they were more like nachos than chilaquiles (the tortilla chips were dry... no sauce!!! The tortilla chips are supposed to be bathed in sauce). The ""nachos"" were good, but I was let down because they weren't what I was expecting. I'm still giving 4 stars because the food is good, they just need to stick to what they know and not advertise something not in their lane, i.e. Mexican food."
,,,,,"Every dish I ordered was fantastic! I'm not a pancake person but the cinnamon roll pancakes were delicious and did not require syrup, since they are very sweet already! The skillet I ordered and the brisket were very flavorful as well. Big portions and a happy belly!"
,,,,,"This place was amazing! I'm not huge on breakfast but it was one of my favorite places I've had. The wait time is a little long so try to get on the waitlist or come at a later time. We tried chocolate chip pancakes, hash browns, fruity pebble pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes, and the berry crepe!"
,,,,,"The only thing I might not recommend is the iced latte, I felt like there wasn't enough ice and it didn't have enough vanilla. I asked for ice but when it came the coffee was starting to water down. Probably a hot coffee would've been better."
,,,,,Quite a wait. Had a table of two and waited about 30 mins. There were several very large parties waiting. 
,,,,,Order the berry pancakes! Soo delicious and fluffy. Their hash can easily feed 2-3 people. Waiters were very friendly and checked up on us several times. 
,,,,,Right next to the museum of contemporary arts so you can pop on over for a visit during the wait or after the meal.
,,,,,"Amazing!!!!!! Loved this spot. So good. Would highly highly recommend. The place was busy, so there was a long wait, But the food was worth it. "
,,,,,Tried the bacon sampler... it was really good. I also had an omelette and pancakes. Also incredible. 
,,,,,This is definitely a good breakfast spot and one that most people would agree is a place you come back to on multiple occasions.
,,,,,Omg- cinnamon roll pancakes are decadent and a real treat for a sweet tooth! So buttery and creamy and delicious. We waited about 10 minutes for a two top inside on a busy Saturday morning around 9AM- highly recommend if you're feeling hungry and have your stretchy pants on.

,,,,,"Another stop here in July while visiting Chicago for a few days. And it is still a great place for breakfast. Lots of choices and our experience here was outstanding as usual. Service is prompt no matter how many patrons are seated. Lots of people waiting to eat outside but we opted for inside. Jeanette was our server and was very attentive, polite, and seemed to enjoy her job. Easy to talk to and always service with a smile. Food was still very good and portions are still pretty large. There are a few of these franchises around town and we have eaten a two of them. Never been disappointed. If you are in town find one and give it a try.  A go to place in book."
,,,,,"First time here this morning.  The place was packed. Hostess said 10-20 minutes.  10 minutes later we were sealed.  Lots of choices between eggs and batter recipes.  I had the pecan Belgian waffles and my wife had the eggs Benedict Florentine. The waffles were just okay.  A little on the dry side but lots of pecans. Eggs Benedict were flavorful and enough for two. Service was outstanding.  Stephanie was prompt and very friendly. I was very surprised at the number of patrons that arrived and left and how orchestrated the staff was. From seating to ordering to cleaning the tables, all the staff made things look easy. A lot of restaurants could learn from this place. All in all a good breakfast.  I will try something different next time and hope that the service is just as outstanding."
,,,,,"First time visiting Chicago and when I looked up breakfast options - this was the first place and with 8k reviews, we had to go. "
,,,,,"Indoor and outdoor seating, right across from Millennium Park. We got lucky and there was no wait. The menu is plentiful, we almost couldn't decide what to get. I opted for French toast and my husband got pancakes. Both were FANTASTIC. Seriously delicious "
,,,,,The staff was friendly and service was quick. I would definitely eat there again and recommend anyone looking for a breakfast option not to pass this place up!
,,,,,"Visiting for the weekend so we were lucky enough to get a seat . The barbacoa chilaquiles skillet is one of the best skillets I've ever had. Shredded beef on the bottom, avocado on top, some tortilla chips on the sides, cheese and two sunny side up eggs over medium was perfect. The house coffee was great too so I didn't need any sugar. Smooth and crisp black coffee. Big portions of everything and the staff does a great job of service and managing the large amount of people waiting. Delicious skillet and good coffee."
,,,,,"So so good! I've been twice during COVID times and the first time, the wait was extremely long because it was a Friday but the food came out pretty quickly for it being a long wait. The second time was much shorter wait time because it was a Wednesday and again, the food came out pretty quickly. The food is always so good! Recommend all the way"
,,,,,"""Incredible customer satisfaction! After my previous review, the manager Ashley reached out to offer me a meal for two on them."
,,,,,Delicious breakfast! Was seated and served quickly. I loved how many different options they had for French toast snd pancakes.
,,,,,Delicious food! Go early to avoid crowds. But they do use waitlist which helped make the wait an enjoyable experience despite bad weather and a long line! If you do have a wait it's WORTH IT!
,,,,,"As a tourist, it's an okay place for diner food. The corn beef hash was what I expected from a diner and the pancakes were okay with the cream sauce on top of it. This is your place if you have a sweet tooth for gimmicky foods. But this place is definitely a step up from big chain diners. The staff was super diligent and attentive and food came out fast. "
,,,,,My partner and I waited 1hr and a 1/2 for a table during peak time at 9am and spent less than 20mins eating. Giving this place 5 star ratings? I think that's a stretch...
,,,,,"I have visited this place many times and I think the food is overall fairly good, their fries are awesome. The parking situation is awful because Costco is right next door but you usually can find a spot after a little bit of waiting. Overall, the staff are pretty quick and the bus boys are always refilling waters and picking up plates as needed."
,,,,,"If you are in the downtown Chicago area for breakfast or brunch, I highly recommend Wildberry. I do have to warn you that if you are in a hurry, this isn't the place for you. I've walked past this place many times and there are always people waiting to be seated. If you read the other reviews, it could be up to 2 hours or more. In my case it was 10 minutes. Unfortunately it's always out in the sun, on the sidewalk. That's the worst of it though. After being seated, the wait staff is quick in getting drink orders and answering questions. I ordered the eggs any style with the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes because I wanted to try as much as I could. My order was out in about 10 minutes and very hot. It's a lot of food so come hungry or ready to share. The eggs were perfectly done. Hash browns were crispy as was the bacon. But the pancakes, WOW. The pancakes are reason enough to come back for. Fresh and tasty without being overly sweet. My mouth is watering as I type this. Anyway, service was excellent and the prices are fair for the quality and amount of food you get. The restaurant is a bit crowded but for good reason. If there is a negative about Wildberry it would be the wait to be seated, but as long as you are prepared, it's not that bad. This is my new go to place when I'm in DT Chicago."

,,,,,Our waiter was super helpful and nice. The Egg Nog French toast was amazing. The fried chicken and biscuits with gravy was phenomenal. Solid choice for breakfast.
,,,,,"Checked out this highly rated breakfast place yesterday, and it was packed just after opening.  I got the ham, cheese, and spinach omelet and hubby got the two egg breakfast with the berry bliss pancakes on the side.  The omelet was light, fluffy, and delicious without being overwhelmingly cheesy.  Hubby was raving about the berry pancakes m, so I tried a bite and they were very good!  We also both tried a coffee drink, which were at least $5 each.  Service was not very attentive for a place where you're paying $26 a person for a meal, so that played a factor in the ranking.  Make sure you check the menu and prices before you head over, because you will be paying for quality and popularity.  Additionally, and this might be a point of preference, but the shredded potato style hash browns seemed a little al dente.  When we mentioned this to the server, she walked around a while then came back five minutes or so later and offered to bring a more crispy side.  We told her not to worry about it - it's a lot of food and we didn't want to waste any.  Overall we might head back again and knock $10 off the price by not getting the coffee drinks as they were not remarkable, but the pancakes were ."
,,,,,I tried the fresh strawberry orange juice which was good and the horchata coffee which was okay but my partner liked it. I got the red velvet pancakes and omelette. It was good.
,,,,,Amazing and consistent! As soon as you try in once you'll always go back! Try the cinnamon roll pancakes  they are to die for!!
,,,,,"When I went there with my son on a weekday and at 7:30 in the morning they greeted me nicely, promptly got me to a booth, and as I ordered right away."
,,,,,"The food arrived very shortly afterwards, but it was delicious.  I got the berry crepes, and my son had the silver dollar pancakes.  "
,,,,,Overall it was a great experience.
,,,,,I was vacationing I'm Chicago for a week and I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I came here for breakfast almost every single day. That's how much I loved it! 
,,,,,"I got the Denver Skillet every time but without the ham since I don't eat pork. I'm also not a coffee person but I really loved the oat milk white caramel latte so I order that every day too. I tried two different pancakes, the signature berry bliss and the Oreo s'more. Both were really good but I like the Oreo one more even though the berry one is the most popular. "
,,,,,The portions are pretty big and I eat a lot so they were perfect for me but definitely shareable for most people.
,,,,,"WORTH IT! Visiting from Miami and I fell in love with Wildberry we came during Labor Day weekend so we had to wait 1.5 hrs to be seated. Instead of getting down about it, we just walked around exploring Chicago. We went across they way to millennium park and took so nice photos! We also visited the cloud gate & there was a show going on in the park. Anyways, I ordered the Mexicans sizzling skillet with a side of signature berry bliss pancakes. These are most likely the best pancakes I've ever had!! Don't be discouraged by the long line, treat your palette at wildberry!"
,,,,,"Every time I eat here- ""OMG!"" Even when there was a long wait pre-COVID, it is totally worth it every time. I've come with larger groups in the past so tried all the specialty pancakes and favorites are the signature berry bliss pancakes and s'mores pancakes! If you want sometime a little less sweet, the chicken and waffles are spicy and delicious and the Rutherford omelette is savory and salty goodness all in one! You can't go wrong with anything here- but make sure you try the pancakes (you can substitute them for any side )"
,,,,,"We got a recommendation from our concierge to hit this place up, and it was so good we ended up visiting four times during our five day visit! Even though the place is seemingly always busy, they're very efficient with how they manage the crowd. Both my fiancee and I tried a variety of different things from the menu and we were never disappointed! Hard to pick a favorite to be honest, but both the blueberry danish pancakes & the chicken and biscuits were up there. If you're in the loop it's a must visit!"
,,,,,Food was amazing. It's definitely a lot for one person so be prepared to have extra to take home if you don't plan to share. We were full but still wanted to eat more because the pancakes were so good. The smoothies are also incredible

,,,,,Overrated. 
,,,,,"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd discovered the best breakfast place in Chicago!  I was so excited. I had a long layover and went straight from the airport to the restaurant early in the morning to make sure my kids and I got in without a terrible wait.  I looked forward to having breakfast at this place for days!!! I can honestly only describe my experience as disappointing. We didn't have a long wait. The waitress was courteous (though obviously needing to keep us moving along).  But the food did not live up to the hype. It was obvious that the ingredients are not high quality. This is diner food. The meal wasn't disgusting, but it wasn't great. I have no idea how this place gets such high reviews..... except for maybe the fact that it was filled with tourists like me thinking they'd discovered someplace special. Nope. The  only thing that tasted fresh to me was the oj."
,,,,,Edited to add the cost.....
,,,,,"Breakfast was over $80 for 3 plates, an oj and a coffee. The prices shown on Yelp are completely inaccurate."
,,,,,"Best breakfast/brunch in America for me.  From Seattle to Orlando, San Diego to Niagara.  I haven't found better.  All around.  I refuse to tell you what to get, close your eyes, place your finger on something, and just order!  It's all good.  I've been enough times to know!"
,,,,,"Cool vibe and great service as well. But most importantly, just good food.  I dig the Berry Bliss pancakes and Brioche French toast....just saying."
,,,,,"Usually the wait is almost unbearable, but I got lucky and was able to snag a table on a Friday afternoon. While indoor and outdoor were both offered to me, I opted for outdoor as that's the only method of dining im comfortable with right now. The menu was available via QR code which is a great way to minimize contact. I ordered the Berry trio French toast and a side of scrambled eggs. The portion was enormous! I didn't thoroughly read the description and discovered some berry cream between my French toast slices. While it was very good, this isn't something I recommend eating regularly. It's more like dessert or a treat or cheat meal. The French toast was really good, it's on brioche. "
,,,,,"I kinda only went just to say I did it. This is more of a volume based chain style restaurant, which means certain elements of intention and care that you find at smaller mom and pop shops probably won't exist. If you're in the area and can get in, check it out but I wouldn't make it a must see or destination spot."
,,,,,Wow!!!!
,,,,,Second time eating here........food was fantastic.
,,,,,"Some places are worth the wait.  Despite the pandemic and accompanied shortage of labor force,  they seem to have retained the magic.  Like an oasis of what breakfast experience is supposed to be."
,,,,,Keep it up!!!!
,,,,,"If you love pancakes or breakfast, I highly recommend this place! There's a wide variety of food to choose from and the service is great. It does get a bit crowded on the weekends and they don't take reservations, so I recommend going early to put your name on the waiting list."
,,,,,"Huge place so even if there's a line the wait shouldn't be long. Great food and decadent sweet breakfast entrees like pancakes, crepes, and waffles make it easy to return."
,,,,,Found this restaurant after a quick google search for a weekend trip in Chicago and the experience was great!
,,,,,Ambiance: 5/10. A very casual brunch spot - nothing standout in terms of atmosphere but also nothing wrong. Very busy our whole meal which makes sense as it's a top brunch spot in town.
,,,,,Service: 10/10. Our server was friendly and attentive despite how busy he was. 
,,,,,Food: 8/10. Food overall was delicious and definitely comfort food vibes. We tried the Los Altos Benedict and the mexicana skillet with a side of key lime pie pancakes. My one minor complaint was that food tended to be on the oilier side.
,,,,,Drinks: 10/10. I forgot to take a picture but we tried the vanilla berry iced latte and the honey nut hot latte. The flavor of both was great and the drink sizes were generous. 
,,,,,Very glad we were able to have a taste of Chicago brunch food while we visited and it did not disappoint!
,,,,,"Didn't like it all. So rude manner, and I believe it was a poor customer service."
,,,,,It wasn't important for them take care of dissatisfied customer.
,,,,,I had a very bad experience in here.
,,,,,"Garden skillet with plain pancakes, swiss berry french toast, rishj masala chai and chai tea latte. Did not like Garden skillet because on the bottom it was mainly filled with blend potatoes in thick layer.It was not tasty as expected and very minimal protein and cheese for $15. Swiss berry toast was very delicious. The best thing was Rishi masala tea  and chai tea latte."
,,,,,"Amazing service overall, they took our order and listened to what we wanted. Even pointed out to better deal for us. Fast and on point. Right next to Millennium park. The food was sooo good, just couldn't stop eating. It felt like i went to my grandma house and she made so much food that i could eat for days. Their portions were surprising, large, they DO NOT skimp on the food. We went back every morning we were in Chicago."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,This place is outstanding! The service was exceptional from beginning to end. The food was delicious with enormous portions. I had the garden skillet that came with a side of pancakes. My friend had an omelette with the signature wild berry pancakes. She also had a lavender matcha latte which was really good. This is a must try! I would recommend sharing if you are not a big eater... I had to take away half of my food. Sooo good will return here again if I have the opportunity. The server kept checking on us which made the experience excellent!
,,,,,"So worth the hour wait! The servers are so nice and help explain the menu. The coffee was fresh NOT like in your average place that keeps refilling watery coffee! The menu is pretty cool-many different options and ways to eat eggs! I had the Denver-hash browns cooked with veggies and scrambled eggs-delish! We also tried the crepe with Nutella and banana...although a bit spongy, hubby actually loves it that way!"
,,,,,"Been to Chicago many times, but this was my first time coming to Wildberry because it's a tradition of the group I was with, and I can't believe I haven't come before! We came for two breakfasts. I loved the Denver skillet and the avocado toast. The portions are massive and the prices are very appropriate. My only complaint is my hotel room didn't have a fridge so I couldn't enjoy the tons of leftovers I had lol!"
,,,,,"We attempted to get in for a Saturday morning breakfast, unfortunately the lines were so long outside we went elsewhere. I'm so happy we stopped by a few days later to try again, luckily the wait to get in was only a few minutes. Service was fantastic as well as the food. Everything came out really fast and for the prices the portions were huge."
,,,,,We found this place on yelp and we are happy we took the Uber ride over. They have amazing portion sizes so if your hungry when you show up you definitely will not be when you leave. The coffee was fantastic and it's right across the street from the iconic been. So it was an overall win-win.
,,,,,"A great place to eat with a TON of menu options! This location is right across from Millenium Park too! We both ordered skillets and they were huge (we both ate way too much). Wait wasn't long (maybe 5-10 minutes) and our food came quickly. If in Chicago, would definitely come here again to try other menu options."
,,,,,"Delicious breakfast! Mmm mm mmm. Yum yum yum. This place was recommended on several Pinterest lists or ""must eat lists of Chicago"" and I can see why. We got to sit outside in the nice sunshine and our waiter was very nice. I got an oatmilk vanilla latte which was great. I ordered the two eggs any way with a sub of the blueberry bliss pancakes. It was heaven on a plate. The bacon was perfect, crispy, hot and fantastic. The blueberry bliss pancakes with that marscapone filling. I could bathe in that! OMG so good!!! Definitely recommend this place!!!"
,,,,,"Wildberry is one of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots in the city! There is always a long wait, but the food has definitely been worth it. The first time we went, it was pre-covid and the experience was amazing - everything from the food to the service. This time, we took some friends with us, and while the food was still so delicious, we had some difficulties with the mosquitoes in outdoor seating, which kinda ruined the atmosphere.  "
,,,,,"My personal favorites are their veggie options and pancakes - there are such yummy flavors - and their fries are so crispy! Our friends really enjoyed their dishes too, and the napa valley fig was definitely a hit for our friends! "
,,,,,"We ordered some warm drinks to help with a cool morning, and a strawberry smoothie to boot, and again, all was wonderful. We will definitely be back, but will try to get indoor seating next time if possible."
,,,,,The first time we attempted to have breakfast there was an almost 2 hour wait.. being hungry and impatient we went somewhere else and vowed to wake up earlier the next day. We showed up bright and early the following day and were seated immediately with no wait. 
,,,,,Our server (I don't remember his name) was very nice and quick throughout our entire visit. 
,,,,,"Our food - the pancake portion - was phenomenal. The eggs w ham & cheese were just... meh, eggs... but lets face it who actually orders eggs at a pancake spot. "
,,,,,The cinnamon roll and wildberry pancakes were the table favorites for sure.. The toffee nut latte was pretty tasty too. 
,,,,,We now understand why the wait was so crazy the morning before and *might* be willing to wait a while next time (but like I said we are pretty impatient - the yelp waitlist being open on a weekend would be a plus!)
,,,,,"I've visited Wildberry on several occasions, each being a good experience, but when I visited the morning of 9/20 it was bad. Now I usually don't use my veterans discount because I usually simply forget to ask if they give it. "
,,,,,"Today I asked and was greeted with a very rude response from my server Amy. First, let's talk about their veterans discount policy. Usually the discount ranges anywhere between 10% - 15% off the check. Their policy is only off the vets meal which is weird especially if I'm sharing a meal which I decided to do today with my girlfriend today but ok, policy is policy. "
,,,,,"I ordered the crepes, 1 egg on the side, toast and a latte. The waiter said that I she could only give me a discount on the toast and latte since it wasn't shared with my girlfriend. After a small debate she agreed to cover all the items in my meal. Then the weirdness started to happen. I showed her my veterans ID that has my name and photo on it. She walked away and came back and rudely asked me for another form of ID to prove that I was the person on the veterans ID, then she asked for ID for the credit card that was being used to pay for the meal which was my girlfriends who wanted to buy me breakfast today since I took her on an amazing date the night before to Gibson's Italia. If you haven't gone yet, you have to go. You won't regret it! "
,,,,,"Back to the story. First off my veterans ID has my name and picture on it so no need to ask for another form of ID. Secondly, I've NEVER been asked to show ID for payment method being used (maybe because it was her black card and she's Asian) and after all this, I still didn't get the 10% veterans discount. "
,,,,,"As I walked out, I ask to speak to the manager and the host at the front desk went and got either the assistant manager or her co-worker. How do I know this? Because I've seen the manager during prior visits assisting and greeting other customers. I didn't say anything because I wanted the show to continue. "
,,,,,"Even after speaking to the assistant manager or co-worker/non manager showing them proof that the discount wasn't fully applied, and explaining the rudeness of our server Amy, nothing was done or offered but I'm sorry this happened to you. Didn't even offer to adjust the discount to apply the full 10% which is only $3. "
,,,,,"This review isn't about the 10% discount at all. This is how they went out there way not give it to me, and how they treated us as customers. "
,,,,,"We will NEVER attend this establishment again. If the manager sees this you need some serious training to be implemented, and maybe look at revamping your veterans discount policy. You never know who is patronizing your establishment. It's the least you could do for those who sacrificed so much."
,,,,,"If you want great pancakes, give this place a try. Everything else on the menu isn't that amazing but not disappointing. Good coffee as well."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Excellent service and really delicious food and drinks. Our waitress was wonderful, very accommodating and sweet. All of the staff we connected with were very nice. Our food came out pretty quickly, with great portions and at a great temperature, and we really enjoyed our meal and experience!"
,,,,,Wildberry was amazing! We tried it our last morning in Chicago and were blown away. 
,,,,,Their latte drinks such as the mocha are quite sweet and rich and come with whipped cream on top. They have Numi teas and regular coffee if you want something lighter. They carry alternative milks including oat. 
,,,,,"For food, we got the signature berry bliss pancakes and the chocolate banana bread french toast. They don't advertise it on the menu, but for about 2/3rds of the price, they can make any pancakes or french toast in a smaller ""side"" portion, which is great if you can't handle/don't want to eat too much sweets. "
,,,,,"The pancakes were delicious- there wasn't much fruit baked into the pancakes, but there was a small portion on the side. "
,,,,,"The French Toast was great- it was a piece of banana bread heated up in a pan with what seemed like french toast batter, topped with chocolate and white chocolate chips as well as bananas. The full portion has 3 pieces, but my ""side"" portion had just one. "
,,,,,"As far as COVID, the restaurant seemed safe with tables spaced out. Service was friendly."
,,,,,"If you are in Chicago, this is a must try spot! Tip- try to go on a weekday, even at 10am on a weekday, the wait for 2 was about 20 minutes. They don't take reservations."
,,,,,GREAT FOOD! We were able to sit outside with a heater and it was great. Wonderful view as well. I highly recommend this place!
,,,,,Waiting time is kinda long but it's totally worth it. Once you get inside they'll take your order pretty fast and food arrives fast as well. Everything came out exactly as ordered and hot. Staff is really attentive and friendly. I will be going back!
,,,,,"Came around 10am on Saturday morning with a party of 2, wait time was around 40 minutes which was pretty accurate with what they told us when we checked in. We were waited on within a few minutes of sitting down. Ordered two lattes, which took quite a while to come. Food came quick enough and was delicious! I'm giving four stars because we were rushed to pay the bill by the waitress after it was given to us, when we hadn't finished our food or coffees (especially since coffees took a while to be brought). I feel like if you wait for a table, then you should at least be able to enjoy the breakfast and not feel rushed. As soon as our waitress put the paid bill back on the table, someone came and took our dishes with one of our coffees not empty. Didn't appreciate that, however the rest of the experience was great!"
,,,,,"The moment you realize you ate too much!  Kinda ten bites too late! Like, the food was so good, you thought your tummy knew better but your greedy eyes kept saying more, more!  Yes Indeed!  All that! "
,,,,,"I typically wouldn't order a Mexican dish unless it's at a Mexican restaurant.  Man oh man, I have to change my rules!  The Barbacoa Chiliques were so good, my grand baby didn't get to her Waffle until she helped me kill the Chiliques. It was across the border good.  Señora somebody was back there cooking that!   "
,,,,,"The food is portioned fittingly for a hungry bunch!  The side dishes are as equal to a main course as I have ever seen on a menu.  I was pleasantly surprised the Barbacoa Chiliques came with a side of Pecan Pancakes!  We didn't have to ask for condiments, the waitress brought them out way before the food.  The staff works very well together.  Very efficient clean and orderly place.  The atmosphere, the area, set up all perfect.  "
,,,,,"Problem, better decide who's driving or if your taking cab.  We just about rolled out of there and sat on the bus stop for a minute!  I had to order an Uber to get back to the room one mile away! "
,,,,,Wildberry needs several disclaimers!
,,,,,1. Food portions are bigger than they appear. 
,,,,,2. Not responsible for you being greedy!
,,,,,3.  We have no beds or place of leisure after you over eat.
,,,,,"4.  Thanks for coming, we value your reviews but we are not responsible for you realizing your eyes are bigger than your stomach!"
,,,,,Veggie skillet was average. I requested no broccoli in my meal and yet it was made with broccoli. I don't particularly blame the restaurant as the delivery receipt clearly did not indicate no Broccoli there must have been an error in the yelp ordering app that did not get the extra instructions note. My main reason for ordering wildberry was the cinnamon roll pancakes... they are the absolute best!
,,,,,A must eat! Literally everything we ate was 5 stars!
,,,,,Berry bliss French toast you can go wrong with! 
,,,,,"Any combo of pancakes, YUM! "
,,,,,Their apple cider was SOOO good and perfect for the weather. 
,,,,,"Barbacoa chilaquiles skillet !!! Oh weeeeeee, it'll be the best breakfast you taste!"
,,,,,"They have so many reviews, I won't bore you. Eat anything hear and you'll be happy."
,,,,,"Super popular breakfast place in Chicago and it was good. On Yelp you can add your party to the wait list but the wait list does close. When I checked upon waking up it was open but when we were ready to leave it was closed. The wait time for two was about 10-15 minutes on a weekday. The restaurant was packed and super busy but the service and food were good. I got the turtle nut mocha and two eggs any style which I did scrambled with cheese, side of hash browns and veggie patties along with speciality blueberry pancakes. It was a lot of food that I didn't finish. I wasn't a fan of veggie patties. The pancakes are some fo the best I have had in terms of consistency and flavor. I will bring guests here for breakfast."
,,,,,"Got breakfast at this place before visiting the Art institute of Chicago and we were blown away! I really wished that they did a reservation system online though. It was kind of annoying to have to wait on the sidewalk and wait for them to scream out names. And then I got have excited when they screamed out a name similar to mine. I'm not sure why the reservation system online was turned off. But on a Monday morning at 10:30 am, the wait for two was 30-40 minutes. We waited probably around 45 minutes. Staff members were not wearing masks. Inside was completely PACKED. QR code's were used for menus. We got a seat outside which was nice, just had to sit next to to the hostess screaming people's names out.. "
,,,,,"We had the wildberry orange juice, which tasted amazing, but wasn't sure if it was entirely freshly squeezed OJ? Didn't say on the menu. We also ordered the mushroom & prosciutto omelette which i did not expect to come with so much hash browns when I ordered it. You could also get a side of pancakes and upgrade it to a specialty pancake for $2 extra. We also ordered the slow roast brisket hash. We both got the specialty pancakes the signature berry bliss and the key lime pie pancakes. The pancakes were DELICIOUS! There's a reason why this place is a pancake place! The signature berry bliss was definitely my favorite. The pancakes were so light, fluffy and fragrant. The berry Marscarpone filing was so perfect in combination with he pancake, I could eat that all day. They Key lime pie pancakes were also very solid, I could not have imagined tasting key lime pie in pancakes but they did a really good job with it! Just wished that the graham cracker crumbs weren't so stale. The omelette was also very solid, I personally love mushrooms so if you like mushrooms, it's full of it! The brisket hash was also very solid. If you're not in the heavy mood, I would not get hash browns, there was way tooo much hash browns. I guess you get your money's worth. Next time I think I'll go for the fresh fruit instead. The portion sizes of everything was definitely a lot bigger than I expected. Didn't have to go get lunch for the rest of the day. Definitely a must come if you're in the area!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Looks pricey but we got the special with the additional specialty pancakes and split it and it was more food than we could eat.  My wife thought the Blueberry Danish Pancake was the best pancake ever and my food was delicious so easy 5 stars but save money and split your breakfast.
,,,,,"Awesome spot! The coconut cream ice coffee was worth a try! The restaurant was very busy but we only waited a few minutes. The veggie omelette was fantastic, hash browns were okay, a little under seasoned. The chicken and waffles usually has bacon in it, however they made it without., just jalapeños in the batter... very good!"
,,,,,Everyone always says to come here early as it gets pretty busy.. they were right. Even for a Monday morning! Luckily we were the first ones in line. 
,,,,,"Ordered the butcher block skillet. I added some veggies to the skillet to balance out the meat (lol). SO GOOD. I highly recommend doing the same. I personally added some mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. "
,,,,,"With the skillet, I upgraded to add the signature berry bliss pancakes as a side. YUMMMM. They knew what they were doing when they made this. So fluffy and flavorful!"
,,,,,"My friends and I dropped by Wildberry Pancakes as we heard really good reviews from the place. We expected to wait, but not stand in line for two hours. Definitely wasn't in the best mood by the time we got seated. "
,,,,,"We all shared the soft shell crab as an appetizer. There was more breading than actual crab which was disappointing, but the seasoning was very umami. I got the veggie wildberry for a light meal, while my friends got tsukemen ramen for the OG Wildberry experience and the bulgogi egg roll. The broth was too rich for my liking, but my friend enjoyed the authentic flavor of hers. The bulgogi roll was a good fusion of Korean and Japanese flavors, but had way too much mayo that it drowned out all other flavors."
,,,,,"A nice visit, but not something I'd look for again."
,,,,,Great breakfast place and quick service! We did come on a Tuesday morning so it wasn't so busy and were seated right away. I was able to get a side of pancakes instead of the full 5 and the 2 pancakes were very filling and fluffy! Service was amazing along with the food!
,,,,,"Had breakfast here while visiting Chicago.   Wait was 10-20 minutes .   The queue went relatively quickly giving the deceiving size of this restaurant.   We opted for three breakfast standards.   We ordered the chilaquiles with the short rib , ham and cheese omelette, and a savory crepe with ham and eggs inside.   We also tried the homemade corned beef hash and pancakes since that was in the name.   "
,,,,,"      The chilaquiles came out hot and served in a stainless steel dish.   The presentation was nice and looked so good, the ham and cheese omelette was fresh ham not some lunch meat substitute.   The corn beef hash oddly needed salt.  The crepe unfortunately wasn't too good.   The crepe was a sweet battered crepe with a savory filling so an odd combination.  We did send it back and the waitress offered a different dish.   We didn't see on the menu that the crepes came from a company which tells me they aren't grilled fresh.  "
,,,,,      All in all for 2 breakfast and 2 sides it was 55.00 since one entree was taken off the bill .   A bit more expensive than typical breakfast but very good none the less .   Service was good as well .
,,,,,It was great!
,,,,,Didn't wait long 15 mins max for a two people table. 
,,,,,"You will be full with your meal especially the skillet meal. I couldn't even start with the pancake I had to take it back to my hotel, which will be used as a snack later on to eat. "
,,,,,We went around 1 p.m. 
,,,,,our server was great but at times she forget what we asked for which we had to asked it again.
,,,,,"I may have gone wrong by ordering the waffle. Maybe if I would have gotten the pancakes this would be a completely different review. But alas I am here reviewing the Fried Chicken and Waffle. It was lack luster. Don't get the waffle. Get the pancakes and prove me wrong that this place is worth 5 stars. Decent atmosphere, but I think it's a little over hyped."
,,,,,"Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought these were just ok. I'm not sure it was worth all the hype. The wait was an hour long and I'm not sure why the Yelp waitlist wasn't working. It was a hot sunny day - a day when the waitlist should definitely be on. Even after our names were called, we had to wait for around 10 minutes to get seated outside. There were no fans, and eating while you're so hot is no fun. Maybe I'll like the food better on a cooler day - I'll have to see!"
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"We were in town for a fun/long weekend and stayed only a couple of blocks from this cafe. I realize they have others throughout the city so maybe experiences vary but this was good, so much so we went back a second time on our trip."
,,,,,"I really like the cinnamon roll pancakes. Fortunately the second time I knew to only order one rather than a full stack because, well, it's just way too much gluttony and sugar to eat with any sort of good conscious."
,,,,,"Definitely portions are a bit crazy and over-the-top but prices are fair, staffing is good and friendly, and overall a great place to eat breakfast!"
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"We tried making a reservation for breakfast but they don't accept reservations . The wait when we got there was about 30 minutes however  we were seated on the patio in 15. We ordered mint mocha , hot tea and coffee along with Avocado toast, veggie omelette and pancakes. Everything was excellent and service although initially seemed rush as we settled down it was okay. I Will certainly come back again!"
,,,,,Really great breakfast selection! Fun options for sweet breakfast food and plenty of savory as well. These pancakes were incredible!! Worth it for the price but I do wish I could've ordered less than 5 pancakes which was far too many for me
,,,,,WOW! Absolutely amazing. Every meal at our table was fantastic. I was debating between Fried Chicken and Biscuits and the Southern Benedict....SO glad I went with the Fried Chicken and Biscuits!
,,,,,"Loved everything about this place! There is a nice wait but boy was it worth it! I loved the vegan options, we returned the next day while we visited from Dallas"
,,,,,"Great service, such a busy place and the people know it! You won't get in here without having to wait through some kind of line. But it is WORTH the wait. Food is phenomenal. You have to try either their French toast or pancakes!! I had both"
,,,,,I came here because I heard good reviews about it and they were right they didn't disappoint the food was great the eggs Benedict were delicious the caramel macchiato was so good ... but was really amazing was the service the waiter was awesome and funny and attentive I don't remember his name but he has a ponytail and beard and tall. Love this place definitely recommend
,,,,,"I love Wildberry! Was so sure that this was going to be just another brunch place--I mean, how good can pancakes and omelettes really be--but they actually do live up to the hype. "
,,,,,"I ordered the butcher block skillet which is as unhealthy as it sounds lol (hashbrowns, cheese, eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, turkey sausage, and chicken sausage). It was surprisingly so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The best part was the pancakes that came on the side though! I will always choose savory over sweet when it comes to brunch but often wish I had an excuse to get both--love that this is a line item on the menu. Therefore also had a side of the signature berry bliss pancakes and they were probably the best I've ever had--the berry mascarpone filling and vanilla cream anglaise was actually the food of my dreams. Absolutely incredible, I will probably never have a better pancake again. Oh and, if you need another reason to go, they serve Intelligentsia Coffee here which is also a favorite. It's these small details that truly take a place from good to great. "
,,,,,"Anyhow, just here to say that all the reviews really do reflect the quality of this place. I often think there is a ceiling as to how good brunch can be but this truly surpasses that. The wait can be long but you can join the line in advance via Yelp. Please check out!"
,,,,,"A bustling breakfast place right by Water Tower Place. I ordered the garden skillet, with a side of the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes. As you can tell from the photos, the portion sizes are huge! I would have appreciated more seasoning on the sauteed vegetables in the skillet dish -- I had to use all the provided salt and pepper packets and requested ketchup, and even that still didn't help that much -- but the eggs were cooked fine. The berry bliss pancakes were great, although they seemed to put less of the berry marscapone filling than what I've had in the past, so hopefully this was just a minor inconsistency."
,,,,,My family and I took a trip to Chicago last week for some shopping and food adventures. This place was so delicious. They seem to have a chain of them in Chicago so you can find several if there is one that's busier. We went right in and got sat right away. 
,,,,,"I ordered the fresca omlette that comes with two sides of your choice. Omlette is made with olive oil infused sun dried tomatoes, provolone, fresh basil with avocado on top. It was such a good combo. I had the hash browns and cinnamon roll gluten free pancakes for my side. These are by far some of the best pancakes I've had so far during my gluten free journey that started a couple years ago. The pancakes literally tasted like a cinnamon roll. "
,,,,,My husband and I shared the omlette and hash browns because it was a lot of food. He did order his own gluten free strawberry chocolate waffle and was just as content with it as I was with my pancakes. Wish they had this in Iowa. We both loved the vanilla berry iced latte. Our waitor was so attentive and nice (wish I remembered his name). Definitely recommend this spot to everyone visiting the Chicago area or in living in Chicago.
,,,,,"Such a great restaurant! I had ordered their chocolate chip banana pancakes, and they were the best pancakes I've ever had. Very fluffy and the taste was exceptional. Great service! "
,,,,,They do not take reservations so we had to join their waitlist upon arrival. We waited about an hour to get seated so we ended up walking around the area to kill some time. It was worth it and I will most definitely be back for more!
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"Stopped by here to get take out breakfast before visiting Millennium Park (it's right across the street!). They are open for dine in as well, but take out is only a 10-15 minute wait, and they are able to deliver it curbside to your car. "
,,,,,"Ended up getting a Sizzlin' Skillet; pancakes are included, but I upgraded so I could get a signature pancake! The Signature Berry Bliss and Butcher Block Sizzlin' Skillet were delicious. The portions were very filling and then some. "
,,,,,Definitely would come back!
,,,,,"Excellent food, the crepes are delicious! Eggs Benedict yummy, and my grandkids loved the pancakes and French toast!  Great service and fun atmosphere! Highly recommend"
,,,,,This place always has a WAIT because it is so good! Well priced and hearty servings. I love it. I don't think you'll be disappointed by anything you try. It's also right next to millennium park which makes for such a nice stroll after your meal. Check it out for a casual yummy fun breakfast/brunch in Chi!
,,,,,(from @tastessky on Instagram)
,,,,,"Wildberry Pancakes does not disappoint! My friend suggested this place, along with the pancakes. My family and I got the burrito, brisket, and oatmeal. They were all good portions and very tasty. We also got 3 side of pancakes and these were some of the most delicious, fluffy pancakes. I would recommend everybody to upgrade your pancakes if it allows it or get a side order to share with everybody. Definitely coming back to try other pancake flavors!"
,,,,,"Stopped by here on a road trip across the country when I was in town for a few days. It definitely had a line in the morning, but since I came earlier I didn't have to wait too long. I was seated at a cute little table on the second floor, and happily ate myself to death. Service was very attentive despite the chaos and crowd of the early morning, and everything I got was delicious."
,,,,,"This is definitely a spot you should visit while in Chicago, yet the line gets really long if you aren't there by 8:00 at the latest. We were lucky and got there early enough that we didn't have to wait, and I must say I think I would've been disappointed if we had to wait for 1+ hours because it's really nothing insanely special. The coffee was good, the food was enjoyable, but nothing very unique or memorable aside from their funky pancake flavors. However, still a good spot to visit if you don't have to wait very long to get in!"
,,,,,So I've never seen a breakfast place quite as packed! I originally planned to brunch here but after seeing easily 75 people waiting to be seated my bf & I chose to come early Sunday. I'm so glad we did. He enjoyed his skillet and I was pleased with my waffle. The breakfast wasn't to die for but it did the job and with all the speciality pancakes I can see what people love about the spot. The latte was delicious and worth every penny.
,,,,,"We were looking for a decent sit down breakfast spot on our trip and came across this place on Yelp and Google.  Arriving on a weekday at around 930am and it was packed.  People were spilling into the courtyard, but it only took about 15 mins for us to get our table.  The seating area is huge, so it's truly an art how this place gets everyone in and out so quickly and can accommodate the crowds."
,,,,,"Our server was very pleasant and upbeat and made some great recommendations.  I ordered the breakfast burrito that was massive and too much to even finish.  The highlight of my experience, though, was their coffee and tea drinks.  I ordered the Rishi Masala Chai and had them serve it over ice.  It was one of the best Chai's I have ever had.  I wouldn't normally count a Breakfast place as one of the best places to visit while on vacation, but this was one of the highlights of my trip!"
,,,,,Order:
,,,,,· Signature Berry Bliss French Toast
,,,,,· Signature Berry Bliss Belgian Waffle
,,,,,· Corned Beef Benedict
,,,,,· Two Eggs Any Style with CB Hash + Toast
,,,,,· Wildberry Orange Juice
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,"· Ate here twice and both times the servers were very friendly. Weekday breakfast at 930 was a 15-minute wait. They do a great job of turning over the tables quickly. Ambiance is spacious, slightly contemporary and welcoming."
,,,,,"· The menu is fantastic, exactly the kind of variety I look for in a breakfast menu. I love fruit with my pancakes, waffles, French toast and the mascarpone berry whip that accompanies the Signature Berry Bliss is the perfect blend of whipped texture and the every so slight sour note coming from the mascarpone to give it more character than straight whipped cream."
,,,,,"· One of the two poached eggs were cooked perfectly with slight runniness inside, but I'll let the other slide since the rest of the dish was just to my liking, with crispy hash browns and tasty corned beef hash. I grew up eating canned corned beef all the time, so if I had to guess, I would say the bulk of it is from a can, but that's okay with me because it's comfort food."
,,,,,"· I recommend the Wildberry OJ, which was a tasty blend of berries and OJ, without being too sweet."
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,"· One of the two poached eggs were overcooked, but not a big deal for me."
,,,,,Comments:
,,,,,· This is my perfect breakfast spot.
,,,,,Breakfast was great! We went early on Superbowl Sunday and did not have to wait to be seated.  I had the corn beef hash (a bit on the greasy side but still great) and my boyfriend has the classic breakfast.  We both shared the french toast and chocolate banana pancakes.  I thought the pancakes were too rich for my taste (more of a waffle gal) but my boyfriend that they were great (his a pancake fanatic) the french toast were exceptional.

,,,,,Wait for about 40min to get the table.
,,,,,It is a bit crowded and noisy inside. 
,,,,,The pancakes are great and the portions are really large. Other dishes are not as good as expected though.
,,,,,"Wow. I do not recommend. The fresh squeezed oj was not fresh squeezed and came in a dirty glass. The water came in a dirty glass. The lettuce was very wilted on the blackened chicken caesar and the side salad. The side salad came out with no dressing. When the waiter did bring out dressing he described a balsamic vinaigrette that was actually just balsamic vinegar. He didn't know the difference. The jelly was in a cracked ramekin. The dressings came out in togo ramekins when the ketchup, butter, and jelly came out in regular ramekins. "
,,,,,"They stuff you in like sardines and just focus on turn and burn. The back waiters stand behind you and wait to take your plate to get you out the door faster. This restaurant doesn't care about your meal. Do yourself a favor, save some money and go to mcdonalds for breakfast."
,,,,,"There's no longer reservations or the Yelp Wait List option so go early. Great service and good coffee. Huge portions!! Corn beef hash left me disappointed, it was mostly over cooked hashbrowns. Long wait for just okay food."
,,,,,"We went out for breakfast on a Monday. Always plan on waiting for at least 30 min to 1 1/2 hour for your table they do not take reservations. Our wait time was only 30 min and we probably waited 20 min .  There is always a huge crowd waiting to get in and for a reason . Everything is amazing food and service . Once we sat down the servers where prompt and efficient. I had the famous bliss pancakes, my daughter had the Nutella crepes, my husband had the chicken biscuit and gravy and my son had an amazing omelet with sun dried tomatoes , chicken sausage and herbs . We have been here 3 times and it's the same greatness every single time ."
,,,,,"To date, the best breakfast I've ever had. Got lucky and didn't have to wait, service was fast and very friendly. Prime location for a quick stop in the city. Got the Espanola Omelet and it included hashbrowns and pancakes for a low price. Will come back here every time I visit Chicago."
,,,,,Be warned - portions are huge!!! Come hungry! :)
,,,,,"A solid spot for breakfast/brunch with friends and family. Unfortunately, this location does  not take any reservations and the wait is about 1hr long. Not quite sure if it was worth the wait. There wasn't anything too special about this place. From service to food, everything is just solid, nothing more."
,,,,,"Honestly, I could eat Wildberry every day. My nieces loved the pancakes. I have tried and enjoyed almost everything, from breakfast burritos and skillets to waffles and specialty pancakes. My favorite way to order is getting a savory dish as the main to split with someone and ordering a specialty pancake on the side."
,,,,,"Had breakfast here during the week of the big snow storm. Very lucky there was no line and the restaurant was not full at all.  Not sure if that is typical for a weekday breakfast, but we considered ourselves lucky!"
,,,,,The latte was excellent and the food was very good. Service was outstanding. 
,,,,,"I ordered the breakfast burrito with a plain pancake side and my friend ordered eggs/bacon with pecan pancake side. Everything was fresh and delicious. I give the food a solid four stars. But my friend said that her pecan pancakes were the best she's ever had. So with that plus the service, full five stars."
,,,,,"The portions are very generous, so there were lots of leftovers. The pancake side could easily be shared with 2-3 people."
,,,,,Am looking forward to returning and trying more of their specialties. The pecan pancakes were recommended and those were amazing. So maybe just ask your server what s/he recommends and go from there!
,,,,,"This was my first time visiting Chicago. My cousin was raving about this place and I love pancakes and breakfast so I knew I had to check it out. I think we waited for like maybe 1.5-2 hours, I can't remember exactly but all I know was it was long af. Everyone was waiting too and willing to wait. It was definitely WORTH the wait. It is packed packed inside, which seems pretty normal for big cities. I forgot the name of the skillet I got but it was so good and such a large portion. I didn't even finish it. But can we talk about the pancakes though?! BLUEBERRY DANISH, that's it. I'm not the biggest fan of super sweet toppings and speciality pancakes. BUT, I do love blueberry danishes. Just imagine if a blueberry danish and a pancake had a baby. It was so good and such a large portion. Also, did not finish it because it was just not humanly possible for me. Service was nice and pretty fast compared to the wait time to get seated. I would definitely come back, I miss those pancakes already."
,,,,,"This location is very efficient with seating everyone and minimizing wait times. I expected it to be a lot busier, but when we got there we were seated within 10-15 minutes. Service was quick as well, know what you want to eat before you sit down! I got the barbacoa chilaquiles which is essentially a hash but potatoes are replaced with tortilla chips. I love nacho anything, so breakfast nachos really hit the spot for me. It was served hot and the brisket with egg mixed with salsa was amazing yet didn't make me feel too bloated afterwards. We also got the omelet and hash browns, which was decent but the hash browns were more undercooked and not crispy enough. For the pancakes, I would say the chocolate sauce dries out the pancake for the chocolate banana stack in particular, but I assume the berry ones are better!"

,,,,,"It was a blustery, rainy and windy day but they made accommodations for those waiting to wait in the lobby of the office building which was nice. Once seated we were greeted by our server almost immediately and we got the process started. I had the French toast and it was yummy and filling. If you are going to order any sides with your French toast then either come hungry or be prepared to share with others. The workers there were all polite, and worked together like a well oiled machine. This was extremely nice and is a rare site now a days. Overall great experience."
,,,,,"This was such a good brunch spot when I was visiting Chicago and was tempted to make a second stop before leaving. If you're not sure what to get, I highly recommend the Los Altos Benedict and Signature Berry Bliss French Toast. Both were delicious and unique flavors of Wildberry Cafe. Menu had a good selection of sweet and savory options. Service was attentive and fast for how busy the place got. Seating was very casual and aesthetics were a bit outdated. Ambience was loud and typical for a Saturday morning diner brunch. Arrive early on weekends to lessen your wait time since it can be 1+ hours sometimes. The bean/cloud gate is across the street to help you pass time."
,,,,,"I had a few friends highly recommend this spot. I'm glad I came, but it wasn't at all what I expected. It was packed for a Monday morning, but we were sat rather quickly. The food was good, nothing out of this world. I tried some pumpkin spice item on the menu and it was okay. Service really was spot on though!"
,,,,,Love the speciality wildberry pancake and the mexican skillet. Beware of long waits on the weekends!
,,,,,Wild berry Cafe will always be my go to for breakfast when in Chicago. The wait is usually very long. So you were able to rvsp your spot. They got rid of the option to that which was just a bad a idea. We waited over an hour on a Sunday. In the summer I would of never complained but it was very cold this morning. They wasn't allowing people to stand inside to warm up for a minute so we basically stuck in the cold. 
,,,,,They are making you keep your mask on while waiting and when staff come to your table. 
,,,,,The food was mediocre. I know there tons of better spots in Chicago and I think over the past couple years wild berry food has gone down hill but i always come because the portions sizes are huge for a decent price. They actually use to be really good. 
,,,,,"There was some outside seating that didn't have a waiting but it was to cold to sit outside that day. My son had order some bacon and the bacon was under cooked we sent it back and asked for more or sausage they sent the bacon out again looking the same way. We probably got back to the hotel within 20 minutes all the bacon was coming up. I'm not sure who was cooking the meat that day, but it was diff under cooked. "
,,,,,This may have been my last time visiting wildberry cafe
,,,,,"I'm giving Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe (Chicago) a 4-star because of the food,. I would have given Wildberry Pancakes a 5-star but knocked it down a notch mainly because it's customer convenience. Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe was busy the day we visited and we had to sit outside while we wait for our table. While my wife and I waited 20-30 minutes for our table which normally is not a huge wait, but when it's hot (in the 80's) and no shade or seating it was difficult. Customer's needed to wait outside in the sun, no seats, and no shade. The food however was exceptional good and plenty of it. I ordered a omelette, hash browns, pancake and toast. Our waiter was very good as he was always checking to be sure we had everything. Prices are a tad higher then most, but not unreasonable considering the amount of food you get."
,,,,,"We went back a day later (Sunday)for breakfast. The wait was 45 minutes, outside in the sun. So if you don't mind waiting in a hot sun it's a good place to eat. I ordered the scrambled omelette, which comes with hash browns and 2-pancakes. That breakfast is enough for two people so I highly recommend you split the meal."
,,,,,Great spot but crazy busy! In my personal opinion the food is not worth the wait but if you love pancakes this spot is a must hit!
,,,,,Sadly updating my prior review. Was so excited to return to Wildberry on a subsequent trip to Chicago and ordered the same pancakes. Unfortunately found a large WRAPPER cooked into my pancakes halfway through. The waiter and manager were both so nice and apologetic. However still concerns me for overall cleanliness and attention to detail in a restaurant so many people visit.
,,,,,This place has the YUMMIEST! berry crepes and warm apple cider you will ever have! Incredibly busy so get on the Yelp waitlist but we'll worth the chaos inside the restaurant. Our waitress was fast and efficient for how busy it was in there! The plates were large and prices were fair! I would definitely visit here again anytime I'm back in chicago!! YUM
,,,,,"This was a ridiculously overpriced breakfast! $18 for French toast, $19 for a skillet, with two coffees and a tip our bill was over $60. Everything tasted fine but for that price it was nothing special a typical breakfast. A family of four would of been at least $100 here"
,,,,,Yummy!!! Excellent food and great service! Arrive early if you want to avoid a long wait; everyone knows good food is here! :)

,,,,,"Very efficient operation with a broad menu and fast service once seated (you will wait about an hour though to be seated). Absolutely packed to the gills inside, so if you're covid concerned this isn't the best spot. "
,,,,,Food was also great - we had crepes and french toast. All good.
,,,,,"Very good breakfast spot right across from Millennium Park. It's got an extensive menu that caters both to the sweet and the savory. Huge amounts of food with each order - kids should share. Nice coffee bar using Intelligensia. The only tough part is the popularity, lack of reservations and no call ahead, and no indoor waiting area. If it's cold, bundle up for the wait!"
,,,,,"I was in the area and this restaurant came up for a good brunch in Chicago. When we got there there was a long line so we put our name on the list and walked around. Luckily it didn't take long for the hostess to call our name. I had the Mexicana skillet, berry bliss pancakes, and pineapple lemonade. The food came out fast and was good not great. The skillet was flavorful and seasoned. The lemonade didn't taste like pineapple at all."
,,,,,"We walked right in on Monday morning and although it was crowded, we got a spot right away. The server was quick and nice, and the food came out fairly fast! The barbacoa chilaquiles were a surprising hit, the chips were a little soggy (as to be expected), but the meat and the sauces were well spiced. The Mexicana skillet (with no sour cream) was really good, I added scallions and had hot sauce and it was amazing. The denver skillet was good, but the farm egg rustic panini had a beautiful runny yolk and was on a toasted ciabatta. The hash browns felt slightly underdone, and the dishes came with sides of pancakes which were rich and fluffy!! Overall highly recommend this place, the location is perfect and it hits the spot for a good morning brunch."
,,,,,"Ever since my first time at Lollapalooza, Wildberry has always been one of my favorite breakfast spots in the country. The pancake menu is always inventive and creative, and this time had all pumpkin-themed dishes for the fall. I got the Pumpkin Bread French Toast and Cinnamon Pumpkin Spice Pancakes, along with a Pumpkin Caramel Latte. They were all excellent but I had plenty leftovers after my Pumpkin overdose. Still highly recommend!"
,,,,,"Great selection of food. Everything from muffins, bagels, oatmeal to omelets! Made fresh, came out fast. Service was excellent. It was so close to our hotel, we went back twice!"
,,,,,We got sooo lucky when we came there was no line 
,,,,,Next day bay boom long line!! 
,,,,,I still would have waited in that line it was that good 
,,,,,Staff was very nice and welcoming! Drinks were delicious as well we got a matcha latte and white mocha latte both delicious 
,,,,,The French toasts was alittle too sweet but with some milk it would have been better! :) my fault for not ordering milk. 
,,,,,The berry pancakes were delicious! 
,,,,,Over all 5 stars
,,,,,"Popular brunchy place serving up waffles, pancakes, omelettes and other typical fare. The menu selection will appeal to those with a sweet tooth or those seeking a savory dish. There aren't any exotic options, but they do a good job with the classics. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Denver skillet and upgraded my side to signature chocolate pancakes. This is a lot of food. With a big enough appetite, one person could eat it all, but I think you'd be safe sharing it with a partner. "
,,,,,"The skillet was hearty and all the ingredients seemed fairly fresh. I dribbled on some hot sauce and ate until I was full. It's a big serving, which mostly makes up for the lack of excitement; not bland per se, just kinda basic. "
,,,,,"The pancakes were outstanding. I would've liked to try the berry pancakes as well, but that'll have to wait for next time. The prices are reasonable and it's fun being there for the brunch scene. Expect to wait up to an hour on weekends (kill time in the parks), and don't be afraid to indulge."
,,,,,TLDR: I've been here a few times and each time I leave so satisfied.
,,,,,"I typically share the blueberry danish pancakes and the butcher block skillet. All of the pancakes on the menu are quite sweet (especially the key lime pie) but I enjoy this one because of the fruit. I think the fruit makes it less sweet. The butcher block is basically every breakfast meat you can think of mixed with hash browns, cheese, and topped with egg. It's quite heavy, which is why I share it. "
,,,,, Any wait to try something else on their menu!
,,,,,"If you want a diabetes-inducing yet delicious breakfast/brunch, look no further! "
,,,,,"I ordered the berry bliss pancakes and the portions are humongous (this is easily two meals for any average human being). The fruit they used tasted fresh and the pancakes were both fluffy and flavorful. The hash browns were what you'd expect, nothing to write home about. "
,,,,,Great service and dining experience.

,,,,,"Im honestly not trying to be mean but really this place is so overrated big time... to start if you're spending all day in downtown it's worth to pay the parking but if not be ready to pay over $25 bucks just for parking, they don't have parking or any type of discount for a garage."
,,,,,The waiting is at least 20-40 min outside in the sidewalk!!
,,,,,"I did not tried crepes or French toast but when it comes to skillets, omelet and just scrambled eggs for kids and stuff... very disappointed,, nothing special, nothing that you could say wow!!! In other words overpriced for what you get..."
,,,,,So if you're expecting to see it enjoy something special or different or great this is not the place.
,,,,,"LOVE this breakfast place! Great bang for your buck. My husband and I split the garden skillet (without mushrooms) with a side of 2 cinnamon roll pancakes. Both items arrived hot and were delicious! The portions are so big here that we can't even finish all of the skillet. I definitely recommend arriving early in the morning because the wait can get long quickly. We arrived at 8:30am on a Saturday morning and were seated inside immediately, but shortly after, the line got very long."
,,,,,This is one of our go-to breakfast places in the city because we leave feeling full until lunchtime and it doesn't break the bank like most Chicago breakfast/brunch eateries!
,,,,,So everyone raves about this place and honestly... I was worried I'd be disappointed. But no. GUYS. This place is legit AMAZING. Went with a few friends and shared so got to try a little bit of everything and truly... there was nothing I couldn't recommend. Definitely try their Signature Berry Bliss- some savory entrees even come with a choice side of it. It is not too sweet which is perfect for me. Will definitely have to go back when I'm in town again. Best brunch place by a long shot.
,,,,,"From the start of our experience,  our party of five felt extremely unwelcome and uncomfortable, the woman calling the names for the reservations was very rude and unaccommodating. Once seated we waited over 25 min for our coffee and ""freshly squeezed orange juice"" which was so watered down and disgusting I couldn't finish the glass if you paid me. Two people sitting at opposite ends of the table from one another both found hair in their food ! Absolutely unacceptable. The food was mediocre and the service was trash. Very disappointing"
,,,,,"This place was amazing! Only had a 10-15 min wait, and we were able to have time to look over the menu and order quickly. I ordered the Denver Skillet, Chocolate Chip Banana pancakes, and the Turtle Mocha and added oat milk. Food was delicious, hot, and fresh. Very nice place to grab breakfast in Chicago! I'd love to come back."
,,,,,This place seems to be crowded all the time regardless of day or time. Definitely worth the 25 minute wait. Our server was nice and friendly.
,,,,,"Food didn't take long to arrive, which was perfect because we were starving. Omg, their breakfast burrito is a must. I know this is known for their pancakes, but I will remember their breakfast burrito. Berry bliss French toast was good as well. Loved the fresh fruits, and sauces. Yummy."
,,,,,Highly recommend.
,,,,,"We were hesitant to try Wildberry at first due to the crazy long lines, but decided to put our names down anyways. "
,,,,,"The food was overall pretty enjoyable! We tried their specialty benedict which was on a sweet corn fritter, and it was pretty tasty, though the fritter was a bit dense. However, the bacon and eggs were delicious, well flavored and perfectly cooked. "
,,,,,"The slow roast brisket hash was also delicious, and the portion size was quite large, definitely more than one meal's worth. "
,,,,,"We upgraded our side pancake to a specialty pancake and tried the signature berry bliss. It was pretty tasty and a nice fluffy pancake texture, but way too sweet for us. "
,,,,,Overall we enjoyed our meal and would come back to try some of their other dishes if the wait wasn't as long.
,,,,,It was my first time been  there. It's tasty and good proportion. .Nice place to hang out with family and friends. Would love to go go again if I visit Chicago next time!
,,,,,Loved this place! We wanted to fuel ourselves up ahead of a long tourist-y day and came here per suggestion of a friendly. We really enjoyed the meal - ordered the mushroom prosciutto omelette with a side of pancakes (upgraded to cinnamon roll pancakes for an extra $2) and hash browns. We both also got our own drinks - hot green tea for my husband and an iced matcha lavender latte with oat milk for me (almond milk was also an option for alternative milk.) 
,,,,,Portion was just right for 2 - the portions are huge so I suggest to split if you don't want to overload yourself. 
,,,,,"Customer service was on point - our server was named Kimberly and was super friendly and brought everything on time, no complaints about anything. She's great!"
,,,,,"The Berry Bliss pancakes are extremely sweet, but a good side to a savory omelette. The Napa Valley Fig omelet was delish! The Wildberry Salad is also on the sweeter side, but the fruits are all so fresh and the candied pecans add a sweet crunch! (I would ask for dressing on the side). Hash browns are nothing too special."
,,,,,Outdoor dining is recommended bc indoor can be loud and crowded. The long wait is worth it!!

,,,,,This was our first stop in Chicago coming off the airplane and the wait of people outside kind of scared us. But one we put our name on the list we were surprised how quickly they called us so that was definitely worth 5 stars in my book . The food was very good and they give you very big portions . The server she was so sweet and attentive . Everything we ordered was delicious . I highly recommend this place we were indecisive at first but we asked out Lyft driver and he recommended this place as well .
,,,,,"Went at 11am on a Monday and no wait time for a table of 2! Just FYI, they are strict on the mask requirement as a couple before us were unable to enter since they didn't have any."
,,,,,"Food: I got the mexicana skillet w a side of pancakes and it was SO good. Too many onions for my liking but still great taste nonetheless, esp the salsa. My friend got the banana pecan pancakes w a side of ham and he was happy. "
,,,,,Drinks: the mango lemonade was GREAT and I'm not a huge lemonade fan. It wasn't too acidic for a lemonade. Friend got the strawberry vanilla milkshake and it was so smooth!!! 
,,,,,Service: everyone was so kind and attentive!! You know they're busting their asses off but they still present w a smile and genuinely friendly personalities 
,,,,,I see what the hype is. PLEASE come on by if you're in the area!!!
,,,,,"If you are looking for the best pancakes in Chicago, look no further! Wildberry's pancakes are second to none. I got the Blueberry Danish pancakes which truly combined the delicious worlds of blueberry danishes and a pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and the blueberries and cream cheese frosting along with the blueberry syrup completed the breakfast masterpiece. With a large portion size, it is definitely worth the $16."
,,,,,"Wildberry has a nice outdoor seating area. The staff are very friendly and attentive. It can get rather busy at peak breakfast/brunch hours, so you might be in for a little wait."
,,,,,"Overall, Wildberry is simply the place to go for pancakes in Chicago. Make a visit and your tastebuds will thank you."
,,,,,"My niece found this place online somehow. We got there and wait to sit indoors was insane at over an hour. However to sit outside was no wait at all. Ummm, let's sit outside in 25 degree weather in the winter in Chicago??? Well I'm hungry, so sure I'm from Southern California, I'm tough, I can do this!"
,,,,,"The blueberry danish pancake was YUMMM. Slow roast brisket hash, wow, wow, wow! The brisket chunks were huge and totally deeee-lish!!! Our server was great (sorry forgot his name) but he was really sweet considering he was outside freezing his future children off just to bring us great food. Coffee was great. The signature berry bliss crepe was oh em gee.....just blissful. Great place, will definitely come back again!"
,,,,,"I came to wildberry on an afternoon, and was hoping that it would be a relatively quick trip since I had to make it to the airport shortly after."
,,,,,"Luckily, this place is totally walkable to the airport line. I popped in here maybe a little after lunch time for a party of one- was seated right away. My server came up to my table really quickly, so that was good. He recommended that I get the signature berry bliss, so that's what I ordered. My order probably only took about 5 minutes to be brought to the table, so that is some pretty legit service."
,,,,,"How was the dish? Great. I only got the one thing, and my entire experience here took probably no more than 25 minutes, but overall I had a positive impression."
,,,,,This is such a feel good spot! Checks all the boxes for a great breakfast/brunch stop.
,,,,,"Best thing is the unique menu and recipes INCLUDING the drinks! Even classics like ""chicken and waffles"" have a unique twist here with jalapeños on top and also mixed in the batter. And my favorite matcha latte was jazzed up with lavender. Their seasonal menu is always the tastiest and freshest. Must try."
,,,,,Portions are beyond generous. 
,,,,,Service is kind and on the ball.
,,,,,Only penalizing for the long waits to be seated and it's definitely on the pricier side!
,,,,,But I never stop in Chicago without coming in to Wildberry :)
,,,,,"Okay yummmm! This was the first spot I ate at after arriving in Chicago. Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe is located right next to Millennium Park. I suggest putting your name down and walking over to The Bean. The wait on a Friday morning was about 30-45 minutes, so that was what I did. After I explored The Bean a bit, I returned after twenty minutes (it has started to rain) and had my name called out very shortly after I returned. "
,,,,,"The first thing I want to mention is how fast their table turn around is. Wowwww. With the number of people dining in and waiting, it was no surprise that I was able to get seated in less than 20 minutes. "
,,,,,"I got the Fresca omelet, hash browns, and a side of the signature pancakes - Berry bliss, I believe. SO GOOD! I was very happy with my order and glad that this was my first stop in Chicago."
,,,,,Went there on a Tuesday morning for brunch. Waited only for about 15 minutes. Our server was extremely polite. He was super busy but he still took great care of us. He refilled our drinks on time & was attentive. Food came out at a good time and everything was delicious. 
,,,,,"Despite the busyness, the restaurant staff all were  super nice. Restaurant itself was clean. Food and drinks was great. We will definitely come back. Highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,"This place is amazing!! Been here multiple times and I think I've found my favorite item on the menu....THE NAPA VALLEY FIG OMELETTE. I've never had a breakfast item like this ever before. The figs works surprisingly well in it and couldn't believe how good it was. Omelette comes with 2 pancakes, I upgraded to the speciality pancakes. Usually I go with the signature but decided to try the blueberry danish and they did not disappoint. 10/10 would recommend coming here."
,,,,,We thought we could avoid a crowd by coming on a weekday morning but there were still plenty of people around! It was 15 min wait for 2 on a Friday morning and their estimated waits are very accurate. The food also came out very fast.
,,,,,"We had to get the signature berry bliss pancakes. It was crazy large (5 whole pancakes with all that cream!) but so delicious with all the berries. Worth the hype for sure. We also got the Mexican hot skillet which was very savory and heavy and balanced out the sweetness of the pancakes. I loved it so much that I noted down the ingredients to see if I can recreate it at home! The mocha was standard, not special but tasty. "
,,,,,The portions here are huge. Each dish can be shared by two people. Overall worth the wait and is popular for good reason!
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,Ordered the Avocado Toast with a side of fruit. The avocado comes mashed and seasoned with lemon and salt/pepper and it was quite good. Maybe a little too much cheese for my liking but it was easy to just scrape the chunks off. Too many cantaloupe/honeydew (not my favorite fruits) in the fruit cup but it was still a nice refreshing side. Also got a side of the honey-cured bacon which was really not great. Didn't get any sense of honey at all and the bacon itself was nothing special. Cinnamon spice latte was delicious.
,,,,,Food is just ok for the price. Hash brown potatoes were tasteless and I had to make it edible with the hot sauce.
,,,,,I am not certain if $4 black coffee and $18 avocado toast are worth it. 
,,,,,Service was great- attentive and quick. The place was full by 8 am.
,,,,,Would come back again in a heart beat. Not only was their food really good but it was really impressive to see how well everyone working communicated and just in this rhythm and flow of getting food out while also having great customer service. Dustin was very helpful with our orders as we almost ordered way too much for the two of us. 
,,,,,The blackened chicken salad was so good!!
,,,,,I only wish my stomach was feeling alright in the morning because I really wanted to get the chorizo Benedict they had.
,,,,,Had brunch with my family at wild berry. It was 8 of us and we all ordered an individual dish. I ordered the berry bliss waffles w/ hash browns and the hazelnut latte w/ oat milk. I've average it around a 3/5 and the waffle itself didn't taste good. Everyone had gotten their food before me & it was just a sad brunch. 
,,,,,"Nonetheless, I did enjoy the amount of hash browns as a side. I think it was a good amount of flavor / salt and a beautiful crunch with a large portion. Presentation for every dish is so beautiful, but the food itself to us wasn't as good. My cousin ordered a meat skillet with chorizo meat and it was pretty good and delicious. A lot of us tried a bite of it. My brother and cousin ordered the chicken and waffles & the chicken tasted really good! I would've ate the chicken itself. Juicy and crunchy' I think all their bacon is smoked, so it's also pretty good and crunchy for what it's worth. "
,,,,,"My waffle wasn't necessarily bad, the texture was rough to an extent and the berry bliss sauce tasted really sweet with an unsweetened waffle. Fruits tasted really fresh so I did enjoy eating fruits with my brunch meal. "
,,,,,Staff were rushed since we went closer to closing and you do have to wait for the whole party to show up in order to be seated. I believe tip is added after a certain amount of people to a party. 
,,,,,"Parking in the area is obvious not good. This is located in the heart of downtown across the bean, so the parking not only is expensive, and also hard to find. You can make reservations when you get there, put your name down and wait until your whole party shows up and they open a table for you. "
,,,,,"I'll consider giving this another try and ordering other brunch dishes. This was really sad because I know they're known for really good brunch, and I didn't have the best dishes. Sitting is really right in here and I felt like I was super close to another table, so they also have tables inside too. We spent around $270/8 people  and that's including tip with everything we ordered. "
,,,,,"Was a very expensive brunch, and not the best for what we ordered or quality. I was super tired and hungry this day so I was hoping for some delicious dishes coming from their amazing food reviews. "
,,,,,But I'd give it a 3/5. 
,,,,,Service : 3.5/5 
,,,,,Food : 3/5 
,,,,,Parking - 1.5/5 
,,,,,Atmosphere : 4/5 
,,,,,Would try again and order new dishes!
,,,,,"Good place!  We came here when it was raining slightly and pretty cold out so when we saw the line at the door, we thought we were out of luck.  We were willing to sit outside because we just wanted a quick breakfast so we were seated within 10 minutes.  The food came out so quickly after we ordered, we probably finished eating and paying before people lined up outside were seated for their spots inside."
,,,,,We shared the signature berry bliss waffles with a side of bacon and orange juice.  It was pretty sweet but the waffle was thick so it wasn't overly sweet.  Definitely an easy breakfast for us to start us out on our day of touring and sightseeing!  I would come here again for sure to try the other menu items.
,,,,,This place was so good beyond belief that we visited the restaurant twice in the span of 4 days. This is now one of my favorite brunch spots and I totally get the hype and 2+ hour waits for this place on the weekends. 
,,,,,"Our first visit was on a Sunday at prime brunch time, we put our names down around 11:30am and the wait was around 2 hours. They're really great about keeping the lines moving and will seat you right away once your name is called. This location allows you to sign up for texts so you can go explore surrounding areas while you wait for text updates. "
,,,,,"My friend and I would order two entrees and share, the portions are HUGE. Come hungry or you will def have leftovers! "
,,,,,"We ordered the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes, which are by far the most delicious pancakes I've ever had. Not only was the presentation beautiful, every bite was creamy, fluffy, and jam packed with berry flavor. We didn't want to order the full 5 stack, so we got a side for $7. We also tried the Florence Benedict with hash browns. Omg this was unreal. The benedict was cooked perfectly and every bite had a ton of bacon and spinach. The hash browns were fresh and cripsy. "
,,,,,"The second time was on a Tuesday and there wasn't a wait at all around noon! We tried the chocolate chip banana pancakes, which you can add-on for $2 extra with the order of a skillet. The pancakes were so good, they're very generous with the amount of toppings. We got the butcher's block skillet which was to die for. So cheesy, meaty, and hearty. It came with eggs, we ordered it scrambled. Once again, huge portions and it was a perfect meal size for two to share. "
,,,,,"The price is very generous for the amazing service, delicious food, and great location. Highly recommend this place for brunch or lunch, it will not disappoint!!"
,,,,,"Amazed, yet not surprised that Wildberry has over 8,000 reviews on Yelp. I mean, when it comes to breakfast restaurants, it's usually the first or second place that people mention. It's quite popular, with a couple locations in the downtown area, and well known for their specialty pancakes topped with beautifully displayed fruit and syrups. With a spot located across the beloved Millennium Park, it sure has got its attention from not only tourists, but locals as well. Being a huge Hotspot for foodies, I was a bit excited to finally try this place out for myself. Get here early, cause by 9am or so, there will be a line out the door to get a good seat inside, and unfortunately, there are no reservations available, walk ins only. "
,,,,,"So it's a bit crowded in here, but not bad enough where you're scrunched up between other parties. Service is very on time with taking your orders as well as getting your food. Coffee is exquisite, as it appear they are serving local coffee titans Intelligentsia's product. Had to get a couple cups of that!"
,,,,,"Now onto the food. Personally, I'm not a big carbs only for breakfast type, so I got myself an omelet. Nothing out of the ordinary with their options, but what I did find cool was that as an alternative side, you have the option to get cauliflower hash browns. I love it! They didn't taste bad neither!"
,,,,,"So I can definitely see why Wildberry got the praise they've received: prime location, wonderful display of their staple dishes (I was admiring the table next to me and their pancakes), and better than good service. A great spot to bring your out of town friends and family for the start of your day, before exploring everything the downtown area has to offer. "
,,,,,"Outdoor seating is available too if you're mad enough to enjoy your eggs in 20 degree weather. I would never, but that's just me."
,,,,,"On a quick visit to one of my favorite cities, we were looking for a nice breakfast before hitting up the Friend's Experience. We were staying at London House and this place was walkable option and the reviews and rating made it a no brainer.  We turned the corner and saw a massive amount of people waiting outside the Prudential Tower, right across from Cloud Gate. We almost turned around but decided to see what the wait was. We took bets and expected about a 2 hour wait. They said half an hour. We wanted to see things nearby so we decided to wait it out, being skeptical about the wait time. They actually seated us inside within the half hour. Bonus points for them!  Customer service was really good and they gave us great suggestions. "
,,,,,"On to the food. We knew we wanted the Signature Berry Bliss because that's why they're known for. I ordered the Butcher Block Skillet since I was in the land of meat and potatoes. I subbed a specialty pancake which was the cinnamon roll pancake. That skillet was massive and oh so delicious. They did not skimp on anything. The table also got the Oreo S'mores pancake, the signature, and fried chicken and biscuits. My travel crew is awesome and we rotate plates. Everything we ate was so delicious. We just couldn't decide on a favorite pancake because they were all so good in their own little ways. If I had to choose I would go with the cinnamon roll one again and the table had the same thoughts. I still want to try other things on the menu. I know I'll be back in Chicago and I will break my rule about going any place twice while traveling!"
,,,,,People seem to rave about this place but I just don't see the hype ???
,,,,,"I came here for brunch and of course had to order their signature berry bliss pancakes. Also got a side of hash browns. Let me just start off by saying - their portions are HUGE. Either come here with a large appetite or be prepared to have a lot of leftovers. Even though my friends and I convinced each other we would finish it all, we barely even finished half. "
,,,,,"Here are my honest thoughts. The pancakes are very distinguishable. Appearance wise, they're stunning - drizzles of berry glaze and garnered with fresh-cut fruit. The texture is very cake-like and fluffy. Personally, I just felt that they were way too sweet and felt a little sick after a few bites. The hash browns didn't help much because they were also very heavy/greasy. That's not to say that their food isn't good, but just didn't live up to the hype for me. My friend also got an omelette and we all thought it was kind of funny that it resembled a log it was so massive."
,,,,,"Luckily we woke up on a Saturday morning jet lagged, so we arrived at Wildberry early enough to beat the crowd. It was around 7:15 am. By the time we left an hour later there was already a huge line. So if you want this place, arrive early. The place is back to full capacity and I'm assuming staff that weren't wearing masks were vaccinated. "
,,,,,"I was really underwhelmed by the food. The veggies in my Benedict were over cooked and my hash browns were undercooked and soggy. Then it was very over priced. Which is to be expected for a tourist area, but still disappointed."

,,,,,"Stopped by for a late brunch on the weekday and this place was surprisingly packed! I started off with an americano which comes out in a surprisingly large mug. All their coffee is from intelligentsia and organic! I had the chicken and waffles, which came with a surprising twist of bacon and Jalepeno in the waffle batter as well as on top! Chicken bits were moist and the waffle was great with a bit of syrup. One of my friends got the omelette with specialty pancakes which was a big portion and looked as delicious as well. Our server was also super nice as well!"
,,,,,"5/5 FINALLY, a breakfast place that lives up to all the hype. Got the eggnog French toasts and biscuits with gravy while visiting Chicago with a friend. Both were extremely delicious especially the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was hearty loaded with flavor not just salt. It had such an amazing richness to it that I would go back just for that. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Chicago"
,,,,,Loved this place (not surprised given it's high yelp rating with such high reviews)
,,,,,Photos of what we ordered are attached. Everything's was fresh and yumm!! except My wife did not like her cinnamon latte.
,,,,,Fair warning: humongous food quantity!!
,,,,,This is definitely on my go-to list for every Chicago trip.
,,,,,"This is it, the super famous, always packed breakfast place to be. "
,,,,,ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 9/10
,,,,,"Super spacious indoor seating with enough for 90-100 in addition to an outdoor patio that seats 40-50. Even with that though, expect to have  to wait a little bit no matter what time of day. This place is full of people at all times. "
,,,,,SERVICE: 8/10
,,,,,"Even with the busy hour that it was, we did not have too long of a wait and were seated within 30 minutes or so. Our order was done rather quickly despite the waves of other customers with us. "
,,,,,FOOD: 9/10
,,,,,"Butcher Block Skillet - 8/10 - Standard meat lovers skillet with eggs, hash browns with cheddar & jack cheese, 2 eggs, ham, sausage, turkey sausage, chicken sausage, and bacon, making for a delectable, heavy platter. I definitely did not finish this in a single sitting and no doubt few people would. No problem, leftovers are great."
,,,,,"Piña Colada French Toast - 10/10 - A specialty menu item, and a shame that it is, because this was FANTASTIC. I want to say that the pancakes themselves were infused with some coconut flavor, maybe mixed in the batter or these were cooked with coconut oil or something. The coconut essence was definitely intimately tied to the toast itself. It was crisp, sweet and soft on the inside. A must have."
,,,,,VALUE: 8/10
,,,,,"It certainly isn't cheap diner food, but the quality is a good match for the  price for sure."
,,,,,PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 9/10
,,,,,I'm coming back here.
,,,,,"TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT: Yes, eat! "
,,,,,OVERALL: 9/10
,,,,,My family went on a vacation to explore the Windy City in the beginning of August. We we're there for 8 days and ate at Wildberry at least 3 times. We became completely obsessed! 
,,,,,"Truly the best pancakes I've ever had in life! I'm still going through withdrawals! Wildberry, please find your way south to Orlando, we're big foodies and love brunch here too! "
,,,,,"All of the food was amazing here. I also tried the Mexicana skillet, and another version of pancakes but I took to long to write this and now I forgot which ones.. oopppsss I just know they were amazing! To drink I loved the iced toffee nut latte. My daughter became obsessed with the variety of iced green teas. "
,,,,,I'm positive they can do no wrong!
,,,,,"We visited Wildberry during our stay in Chicago. We arrived closer to closing time, but the staff were very patient and helpful. I mentioned that some of the pancakes and be ordered at IHOP, and our waiter said, ""this ain't NO IHOP!"" LOL"
,,,,,"He was totally right and funny! I ordered the butcher block skillet along with the cinnamon roll pancakes. The skillet was a meat lovers skillet and was pretty good. The cinnamon roll pancakes were also delicious. I also ordered the honey toffee nut latte, and that Was perfect. It wasn't super sweet, and wasn't bitter. I enjoyed the food and the service and will definitely return on my next visit to Chicago."
,,,,,My husband and I were in town celebrating our 18th wedding Anniversary this weekend. We heard such good things about this place. We arrived and there was a line that moved rather quickly. We waited about 10-15 minutes to be called. Our waitress was bubbly and very warm. We ordered our food and within 13 minutes we were served. The food was delicious and so filling. I barely finished because they give you such good portions. They have the best orange juice...it's freshly squeezed! I can't wait to visit again...I'm definitely a fan:)
,,,,,"Feels like a typical brunch spot, like a fancier ihop. I love ihop so that is not an insult. "
,,,,,We got:
,,,,,"- slow roast brisket hash: huge portion. They were not stingy with the brisket either. The entree did taste a bit bland, we had to add salt. I'd rather add salt myself than the entree cooked too salty; if it's too salty, I can't do anything about it so I appreciate that they made the dish a bit bland. Some hash were cooked crispy/burnt. I love those crispy parts. "
,,,,,"- side of cinnamon roll pancakes, which were divine. I don't even like pancakes and this was my favorite. Freaking delicious. The pancake was cooked to perfection. It was fluffy and buttery, great base for their delicious cinnamon roll sauce(?)"
,,,,,"- signature berry bliss French toast. French toast could've been soaked in a little longer but that's okay. The mascarpone was a great partner to the berry jam(?). again, huge three slices of toast. "
,,,,,"Service was great, food came out fast. I truly have no complaints for this place. The only thing is that, everything was great but it wasn't magnificent/marvelous/heavenly. That said, I'd say 9 Gryffindor points out of 10."
,,,,,"I used to love IHOP's unlimited pancakes deal, but Wildberry's takes pancakes to the next level. I'm always so stuffed that I'm bewildered how I used to go to IHOP's. "
,,,,,"There's no reservations and the line can be seen snaking around the corner on weekends. I like to go on weekdays instead to keep my fingers crossed that I can get in within 30 minutes. It's a fairly large restaurant, but it's always packed! The location is prime in Chicago, so even if you have to wait a while, you can take a nice stroll at the park next door. "
,,,,,"I like to always order the egg menu items that come with a side of pancakes, and then upgrade the pancakes to specialty pancakes. Trust me, this is more than enough food for one individual already and the value is out-of-this-world, but my hungry mouth always waters when I read what they offer so I can never order without the pancakes side. "
,,,,,"There's usually more than enough food to bring home and heat up another day. As most restaurant are though, the pancakes don't heat up so well at home, so I would try to finish it at the restaurant. "
,,,,,"Service was a bit slow, and it felt like our server was trying to get rid of us as soon as possible. I get that it was a busy day but there wasn't even much of a smile from our server."
,,,,,Best place for breakfast hands down in Chicago! We visit here every year and the food is always fantastic! The service is amazing and it's right across from Millenium Park so you can enjoy a fantastic breakfast and walk the calories off after. You seriously have to try Wildberry!

,,,,,"I went to Wildberry this past weekend with a party of 9. It was a good time. I will say--for those interested in bringing larger groups, make sure that you're inviting timely people. "
,,,,,Wildberry doesn't play about your FULL party being present before you're seated. 
,,,,,"I ordered the Rutherford omelette and chose hash browns + pancakes as my side. Overall, the meal was just average. The omelette had too much goat cheese for my tastes. If I come again, I would definitely order something else on the menu."
,,,,,"We arrived for breakfast at 9:30 on Wed morning.  Line was short and we were seated within 5 minutes.  While you're waiting in line, take a look at their online menu which you can scan from the sign out front.  "
,,,,,"Once inside, the place is absolutely packed.  Forget social distancing in here.  They have a full menu here and we ordered the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes and the Buffalo Chicken wrap.  Service is relatively fast considering how much business they have."
,,,,,"Only two complaints about this place.  Price is a little high.  For $17, would expect at least some bacon to come with the pancakes.  Since the tables are packed so close together, you can hear what the neighbors are saying.  Apparently the father and son next to us is seeing each other for Christmas vacation and the parents are divorced.  Father was trying to do catch up on life.  ""Um.  What's the 7th grade dating scene like now?  I give you permission to hold hands while dating, but no more than that.""  ""Why do you need to give me permission to do anything?""  ""Cause you're only 12.""  Probably more than I wanted to hear while I was enjoying my berry pancakes that didn't come with any bacon."
,,,,,"This place is definitely worth the money! You get soo much food and at an affordable price too. Very cozy breakfast and brunch spot. They do have lunch but the breakfast won't let you down! I got the Mexicana skillet because I love the jalapeños and avocado, but they also have a brisket skillet so I was considering both and decided why don't I just change out the chorizo in there for brisket.... Best decision I made! The brisket meat is a must have! For the sides we got berry bliss pancakes which are their specialty and for only $2 more it was definitely worth it. The anglaise topping really made the pancakes and fruits very succulent. My buddy got the Oreo s'mores pancakes and that was really good as well but reserved for the people with a sweet tooth. We got hot chocolate which was regular hot chocolate. But the wild berry orange juice was a mistake. I don't recommend it, better off with a regular fresh orange juice."
,,,,,"Our hotel was a 10 min walk away, so we literally woke up at 6:40am to eat here and go back for a nap. We got here before it opened and there was already a line. "
,,,,,"We shared one of the skillets, added some extra eggs, and upgraded the side of pancakes to the specialty Wildberry pancake. The skillet was so good! Perfect portion for sharing. The pancake presentation was a little lacking but it did not take away from the taste. Super fluffy, and perfect way to end breakfast on a sweet note. "
,,,,,This place is also located across the street (about a block) from the bean!
,,,,,This wonderfully quaint brunch restaurant is deserving of more than 5 stars in my book and let me tell you why I would rate a simple brunch spot as being over the top wonderful: 
,,,,,"1) the service in all facets, from checking in for the waitlist to paying the bill and all steps in between, was efficient and pleasant. Think of the efficiency of a chic-fil-a drive thru at lunchtime and turn that into a sit down restaurant and that's what you have here. Food runners drop off the meals to right people at the table and promptly return with any additional requests (like specialty hot sauce or lemons). Those who bus the tables are there to scoop up your empty dishes or bring you a new fork when you drop it without you even asking. And drink refills, the water was refilled when I was half way done and I never ran out. The server we had was amazing as well and as soon as he entered our food order, he immediately returned to the table with the accompanying condiments we requested when we placed our order. This meant once the food arrived, we already had what we requested to use with the meal (ketchup, sour cream, syrup, butter). "
,,,,,2) the coffee bar has an unbelievable list of concoctions they can make. I decided to try the seasonal specialty peppermint coffee drink and it did not disappoint.
,,,,,"3) outdoor seating in downtown Chicago - Although we could not enjoy the outdoor seating on our visit due to the weather conditions, the amount of outdoor seating and the location of it is a huge bonus for a brunch place. "
,,,,,"4) food quality and portion size - I ordered the Mexicana Skillet (price was $19). The skillet was not overly stuffed with the filler (hashbrowns) but was overflowing with the chorizo and eggs! Plus, it came with a side of two pancakes. The whole meal was delicious and more than I could eat so well worth the $19. "
,,,,,Tip - do not be discouraged if you show up and there is a wait with a ton of people standing in line. We were told we had a 45 minute wait and it was closer to 40mins. The line moves promptly through because of the amazing efficient service described above.
,,,,,"I was lucky enough to visit this place pre-pandemic but I'll never forget the food. My friend and I got the Rocky Crepes, Berry Bliss Pancakes, and a Rutherford Omelet. I literally came here for the pancakes because it looked so good. Fortunately, it wasn't all just looks; the pancakes were delicious. They were light and fluffy and the drizzles just put it all together, no syrup needed. My half order that came with the omelet was the perfect size."
,,,,,The omelet was your usual omelet. I think this was the first time I had goat cheese in an omelet and surprisingly did not have a weird taste. Definitely a to try dish if you're hesitant.
,,,,,My friend enjoyed his crepes. It had a very nice flavor that blends well. Not overly seasoned or salted. It was a small portion and I think 1 more crepe would have definitely hit the spot.
,,,,,Overall everything was great. No big complaints and definitely recommend coming here!!
,,,,,Always my go to breakfast place when I can't decide. I always order the same thing! Service is always great and food comes out fast
,,,,,"So I'm only giving them 3 stars because there was no alcohol on the menu and the food was just ok. I don't know if it's because I had just gotten off a red eye flight with no sleep. The staff was ok, not much interaction. Told us the wait was 20 mins but it more of 10 mins. "
,,,,,"All portions are huge so it's definitely sharable. One of the girl in my group took a picture of her food. I didn't take picture of mine, wasn't much to praise. But I ordered a chicken and waffles. The waffles had jalapeños and bacon cooked in it with bacon on top and that was actually good, but the chicken was a disappointment looked like the frozen chicken tenders from a package."
,,,,,Definitely pretty pricey but did not disappoint. Wouldn't mind coming back here but they did a good job and everyone else liked their meals
,,,,,"We arrived around 9:00 and there were several people waiting outside. Luckily, we were seated in about 5 min. The pancakes were light, fluffy, and delicious! These were probably the best pancakes I ever had. The caramel macchiato was also very good better than Starbucks. On the other hand, the Chicken and Waffles was the worst chicken and waffles I ever had. The chicken was not fresh, hand breaded chicken. Instead it was bagged frozen pre cooked chicken that was just plain nasty. The waffle itself was good but what ruined it was the HUGE chunks of jalapeños stuffed inside. The jalapeños should have been thinly sliced or diced. The skillet was a very large portion but disappointing due to the HUGE chunks of bell peppers and onions. I would come here again only for the pancakes and caramel macchiato."
,,,,,130 E Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60601"
,,,,,"I left my friend in the photo  but the food was amazing! I got the mushroom omelette with coconut & banana pancakes. Tbh I couldn't tell you what she got because I was so focused on how good my food was. Everything just tasted so fresh.  Only downside is they were crazy busy so we didn't get refills until the check came. But it's alright, I'd still go again."
,,,,,"If there were 10 stars, this is what Wildberry deserves. Oh. My. Goodness. Now I see why it was nearly a 90 minute wait (make sure you're not too ravenous while waiting or you won't make it). Once inside I ordered a pumpkin latte that tasted like liquid joy. Sooooo GOOD, Starbucks wishes they could, Umkay?! "
,,,,,Ok. So then I got Cinnamon Roll pancakes and an omelette with veggies. The omelette was perfect and delicious and the breakfast potatoes alongside it were crispy (as requested) and so delicious! 
,,,,,"Now these cinnamon roll pancakes ... please bow your head so we can pray and be grateful these things exist  EVERY BITE WAS A PARTY in my foodie little mouth! Wow! Let me describe this goodness-on-a-plate to you. You know how if you love cinnamon rolls, you save the ooey gooey center of it for the last bites because it's just moist and smothered in all of the cream cheese icing, cinnamon and love that it was wrapped with in the layers?! Imagine THAT on top of a stack of pancakes!?  Ok. I'll wait while you go find your Mama and slap her!  I'm still daydreaming about this short stack of joy! I'll forever and ever make sure to hit up Wildberry anytime I'm in Chicago. You should make it your business to do so too if you know and love amazing breakfast."
,,,,,"I can tell why this place is so well-loved! The food here was fantastic, and our only complaint was that there was too much of it. The portions were enormous! There was a long line outside but the two of us were seated within ten minutes. I ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, then we split orders of hashbrowns, seasonal fruit, and chicken sausage. The pancakes come in a stack of five fluffy pancakes, with cinnamon sugar in between each one. I ate about half of the stack and could not finish the rest. The hashbrowns were shredded, crispy in places on top and soft underneath. The fruit was fresh, and the chicken sausage (comes with three links) was small but cooked well. The restaurant tables are very close to each other and it was packed on a weekend morning. Overall, excellent food and fun flavors!"
,,,,,Landed in Chicago and grabbed my first brunch at the Wildberry Cafe. Within 10-15 minutes of a wait time we were seated in a buzzing environment where I then started with a big mug of coffee which got me all fired-up for the meal that followed. 
,,,,,"The two of us saw the portion sizes upon entering (and from past experience), we decided to start of with a Skillet for the savory component and super-set it with a side of Specialty Pankcakes to bring in the sweet element."
,,,,,"The Butcher's Block: Was extremely filling and absolutely worth it. I was loaded with cheese, eggs, bacon, turkey sausages, pork sausages and a whole lot of goodness."
,,,,,"The genius move was subbing the side of regular pancakes with the Specialty pancake for a small sur-charge which is just the right quantity to share between two. The Blueberry Danish Specialty Pancake was absolutely fire with fresh Blueberries, a Danish cheese filling, Almond streusel, Blackberry coulis and Cream cheese glaze."
,,,,,"This meal was extremely satisfying, the service was efficient and my belly was happy. Worth a revisit!"
,,,,,"So yeah... long story short, this place is worth the hype. Not much more to say, so I'll keep it short. "
,,,,,It's located the heart of the Magnificent Mile. So A+ location. We were able to walk from my hotel (Silversmith). We put our name in and it was about a 45 min wait. Appreciate that they text you when the table is ready. It allowed us to walk around Grant Park and see the Bean and Buckingham Fountain-- way cooler than just standing there for 45 mins!
,,,,,This place is super fast and efficient. Your meal comes out really quickly. We each got iced coffees-- possibly the only weak spot. They must have put hot coffee in with ice because the ice was melting super fast and it tasted pretty watered down. So don't recommend getting the iced coffee.
,,,,,"Food was spot on and the Signature Berry Bliss pancakes are an absolute must. I am normally a chocolate breakfast person, but these were honestly AMAZING! "
,,,,,"Also, a special shout our to our waiter. I had thought my boyfriend paid when I went to the bathroom, so I got up to leave as my boyfriend went to the bathroom. I was standing outside and our waiter came outside and said ""So how would you like to pay?"" I was MORTIFIED because it looked like we were dining and dashing! I profusely apologized and our waiter was super cool and professional about it. Lesson learned in communication with the bf going forward. lol"
,,,,,"A super crowded breakfast place as always no matter what season is. This wasn't our first time to order from this restaurant. We know they are always busy so we usually order online & pick it up. My husband walked to the restaurant to pick it up, around 4 mins from our hotel. He said it was like 40-50 people waiting in line to dine in. They still have outdoor seating even in the winter ( heat are provided). I ordered only signature berry bliss pancake for 3 of us to share as we didn't want to be so full for lunch. The food looked a bit messy on the way walked back the hotel but their food was top notch. A very generous portion that filled us up fast. Highly recommend breakfast place in Chicago."
,,,,,This location is popping because it's right across the street from Millennium Park. We put our names in at 11:30am on Saturday and were told it would be a 90 minute wait. They ended up seating us after 45 mins! They service seems very quick and efficient here. 
,,,,,"The portions are huge and for most things on the menu, you get a choice of toast or pancakes on the side. My friends enjoyed their omelet and hash. I loved my Mexicana skillet. I also got a seasonal caramel pumpkin pie latte and it was just okay. Great brunch place if you're willing to wait to get in! It is also on the pricier side, almost $20 per entree but for the quality and quantity of the food it was justifiable."
,,,,,"Would say overall it's a typical American brunch place, pretty extensive menu with a lot of options! Wait on a Saturday was around an hour for brunch."
,,,,,"Berry bliss pancakes $16 - big stack of 5 pancakes, lots of berries and very filling."
,,,,,"Butcher block $17 - hashbrowns with cheese, eggs, sausage, ham. Wow... definitely something like a meat lover's meal and also very filling. Comes with toast."
,,,,,Food was good but I didn't think it was worth the hype. Service fell short.
,,,,,"Our first dining experience during our stay in Chicago, we arrived early on a Thursday morning, straight out of a red eye flight after a quick detour to check in at the hotel and were happy to see that there was no wait."
,,,,,"We got a skillet each, the Mexicana and the Garden with a side of the banana chocolate chip pancake. Huge portions (priced accordingly) that we struggled to get through. Both dishes were loaded with eggs, veggies, hash browns and cheese and tasted good - flavored and cooked well but probably wasn't given enough time in the oven to brown and lacked that crispiness on the surface. The salsa that came with the mexicana was fresh and amazing."
,,,,,Did I mention portions were overwhelming? I couldn't get past the thought of how much food was going to be wasted especially since we were on vacation and couldn't really carry boxes around. They should really consider doing a half skillet.
,,,,,"Cappuccino was just average, also served in a huge cup. I would skip coffee here. There are so many amazing craft coffee shops right next to Millenium Park."
,,,,,"Our host did not care too much, I don't have too much to say about service other than that it was lacking, we were greeted when we came in but that was pretty much it. We were also given someone else's check but that was quickly fixed."
,,,,,Rating - 3.5
,,,,,Would I go back? Probably not
,,,,,"Food was great, plates of food are pretty big! Our server was great as well and the service was fast. We weren't able to order any of the pancakes though because of how full we were from out breakfast but definitely a must try if you are visiting!"
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"To die-for fries and burgers. Know this for sure - you will wait. Probably a long time. But you will be glad for it. Just do it: walk up, put your name on the list, find something to do for a couple of hours, then return and enjoy something spectacular. My take, make sure to get the fries with egg, garlic aioli sauce, and gruyere. So fine."
,,,,,Great cocktails and a phenomenal beer selection too! As long as you're not in a hurry you really can't go wrong here.
,,,,,"What they say about the Au Cheval burger is so absolutely true! During my first visit to Chicago a couple of years ago, I'm sad I missed my opportunity to try the famous Au Cheval burger. So of course, during my next visit, I made it a point to stop by here. "
,,,,,"I came here on a Sunday evening by myself and waited for a spot to clear at the bar seating area, which was only about 15 minutes. I ordered a Single Cheeseburger and added an egg. The single comes with 2 meat patties and the double comes with 3 meat patties. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The runny egg complimented the melted cheese on the meat patties perfectly.The pickle spear was an added plus to brighten the meal. "
,,,,,"It was safe to say that I devoured my burger in less than 15 minutes. Good thing I didn't order the fries because after finishing the single cheeseburger, I was completely stuffed. I paid my bill and happily headed back to my hotel."
,,,,,"This has got to be one of the best burger spots in Chicago! Just as others had said...the wait is long but worth it. We waited about an hour for our table and it went by fairly fast since we walked around the area and explored. Although everything on the menu looked enticing, I wanted to stick to the basic and get a cheeseburger. I chose the single and that was plenty enough for me since it contains two beef patties. I also added the thick cut bacon and opted out for the egg which was definitely a miss for me but since my boyfriend ordered with the fried egg, I still got to try it. My burger was oh so delicious and the thick cut peppered bacon definitely highlighted it for me which also has a hint of sweetness that didn't overpower the burger. We also ordered a side of fries and it was truly savory! A burger done so right and we were fully satisfied. The price of the burger is a bit hefty but you're paying for the quality. I'm glad I finally got to try one of these staple burger places in Chicago. They actually just opened a new branch in New York that has less waiting time than Chicago but I needed to go to the OG first to give it a try. There's more I want to try on their menu but the burger is just so delicious!"
,,,,,This place is amazing and is absolutely worth the multi-hour wait that you'll likely encounter.
,,,,,"I got the double cheeseburger with egg, but also got the bacon and foie gras on the side. While those sides were yummy and mix well with the burger, I thought it tasted best with just cheese and egg. "
,,,,,I thought the service was very good for how busy they were.
,,,,,Food is Overrated and overpriced. Loved the experience and the service was great! Every now and then I might go to small cheval if someone is in town visiting and it's on their bucket list.
,,,,,If you watch my vlog (
,,,,,) you can hear a really cool story on how we cut our waiting time down from 5 hours to only 45 minutes!
,,,,,DISCLAIMER: won't work with everyone...
,,,,,"Pro tip 1: don't even try calling for a reservation (or to ask a question), because they don't even bother to pick up their phone."
,,,,,Pro tip 2: don't be deceived by the short lines when you arrive. That's because 100+ people already put their names before you and just left because you'll get an estimate of 4-5 hours waiting time. *Jaw drop*
,,,,,"Pro tip 3: If you have a small group (1-2 people), you have the option of snagging a spot at one of the six open seating at the bar. You'll just have to hover over people like flies though! However, keep your name on the waiting list!"
,,,,,"Pro tip 4: A single burger is a double patty, a double burger is a triple patty!"
,,,,,"You know how most girls go burger places and try to share something? Well, at Au Cheval, EVERYONE gets their own burger. That's how ""to die for"" it is!"
,,,,,"Allen and I both got a DOUBLE burger, with BACON and SUNNY SIDE UP EGG. The price is very reasonable- I think it's around $17-$18 per burger (check out the photo of the menu, still in a food coma to not care about the price). "
,,,,,"+1 #EGGPORN. I love how delicate the egg was! Egg white was perfect, and the egg yolk was so good! If you sit at the bar, you can see that they cook the egg in a little egg skillet and really control the temperature."
,,,,,"+1 #BACONEVERYTHING. I usually hate bacon, but this bacon has made me regain hope! Maybe because it's thick-cut, but the sauce on it is so delicious! It made the burger have an extra crunch but it was still so juicy! Wow, I just salivated thinking about it..."
,,,,,"+1 #3JUICY. Okay, my hashtags are just not cutting it. BUTTTT the meat was perfectly cook, not going to lie about it. Eveyr bite was consistent, no charring, and it was cooked medium-well (FYI- that's default). The 3 patty was pretty intimidating, but I FINISHED IT. "
,,,,,"+1 #SAUCE. It was an okay mayo sauce, but balanced well with the other players. "
,,,,,A lot of people here also get fries (SUPER fresh! You see it prepped in the containers!) but we were just trying to finish our burger. 
,,,,,"There was a lot of flavor in the burger, but luckily I did not have a bad sodium reaction to it after. (I did have to chug 3 bottles of water though, during the meal...)"
,,,,,"Come here if you can! Dinner is probably a different experience from lunch, but part of the fun is waiting, right??"
,,,,,"When a place is so hyped up, you expect a lot from the menu. I left feeling just ok about the place, neither disappointed nor elated. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere was nice, with its darker tones and dim lit setting. Very small place, which leads to the long wait times. The server was very good and attentive."
,,,,,"When it comes to the menu, it's pretty small but offers you exactly what you've heard about, which is the bacon & the burger. FYI, I wouldn't really call this a place for vegetarians to eat. The cocktail menu is pretty cool, with different options pertaining to your taste. I tried the Punch #3, which looked pretty & tasted delicious. "
,,,,,"For food, we all got the burger with the thick cut bacon, the duck hash, and the fries. The bacon was thick and juicy, but otherwise the burger was pretty uneventful and plain. Not horrible but not what it was amped up to be. The duck hash was very delicious though, with the fried egg on top. The fries were ok, nothing to write about."
,,,,,"Overall, you should experience this place to go but it doesn't have to be on the top of the list."
,,,,,"Main thing here is to make sure you have the app for saving your spot in line! When we arrived, it was an 1.5 hr wait which I heard was short as it can be 4hrs! What on earth would make that okay?? So we checked in on the app and went about our business and came back when we saw we were close to the top of the list. There is a bar but that is reserved for the wait list as well so do not think you can just go in and sit there."
,,,,,So.....this was my husband's idea. He heard some sports person talk about this place. *insert eye roll* They drove so many hours to eat this burger they were craving. Way to pick a spot but I like new things so I usually go along. It is a very cozy spot as in you can share fries with the next table and loud! The decor is medium wood with industrial lighting so its nice. It says 'diner' on the door but clearly is not!
,,,,,"Now...for this food....I will start on the drinks. I had a Pink Vodka Lemonade. The first one was not bad but the second one actually tasted like the price of the drink I paid for! Ala cart everything so fries came separate. Not enough to share if you are big fry person and if you had tasted the garlic aioli that came with you would want your own anyway!! As for the burger, my husband said it was worth the wait. Me, although very good, I would not wait more than 1.5. We each added a fried egg and bacon, ordered a single w cheese (which means double apparently). His bacon was melt in his mouth he said and mine was not as lovely but still good. I would have no problem going back, holding my space in the app of course!"
,,,,,I was definitely underwhelmed by this place after all the hype. 
,,,,,"We got the single cheeseburger (which to our surprise has two patties) with bacon (which is super thick cut) and an egg. The bacon and egg cost extra. We also got the bologna sandwich. In my opinion, the bologna sandwich was more unique than the burger, but both were super salty and made me feel like I had a heart attacking waiting to happen. Overall it was good, but not as great as everyone had made it out to be, and I definitely wouldn't consider it the best burger in Chicago, much less the country."
,,,,,"Pro tip: they are on the NoWait app so if you have the app, you can place your name in line without physically being there! It'll tell you your place in line so you can time it accordingly."
,,,,,Au Cheval serves some delicious burgers in a really cool atmosphere. It's definitely in the top ten burgers I've ever had in my life. 
,,,,,"Is it worth a three to four hour wait for dinner? It depends, do you have something else to do between putting in your reservation and your meal? It's absolutely not worth standing there and doing nothing (very few things are) while you wait, but it's worth putting in your name early, leaving to do something, and then coming back to eat."
,,,,,"That's what we did. On a Saturday night, our friend put in our name for a table for 4 at 4:00 PM. We came back around 6:30 PM when the app said that our table was coming up, and then we were ultimately seated at 7:00 PM. I would've died waiting outside and been very grumpy, but since we did something in the meantime, it was totally fine."
,,,,,"The burger itself is really delicious. I got the double cheeseburger with bacon and egg (had to go all out knowing this was a 3 hour wait for this) and fries. I regret nothing about my meal. The burger is really simple, but really good. It's incredibly juicy, and they didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked. It was just done their way, and that way was the right way. Expect to spend about $20-$25/person here."
,,,,,"It's darker inside than I would've thought, but it's a really cool ambiance that invites good conversation. It's loud and lively, so it's somewhere in between being in your neighborhood restaurant and a bar in terms of the volume levels. You'll talk louder than normal, but in a good way."
,,,,,"After your long wait, you'll get your burger, down it, and be done with your meal well within an hour. It's a crazy long wait, but plan out your day accordingly, and then you can say you've been to Au Cheval and had a top ten burger in your life."

,,,,,"Once rated the best burger in all of the US, given the chance, I had to try it out. My co-worker and I stopped by around 3pm and it was only a 15-minute wait. I've heard of the wait getting up to an hour or more, but glad we came during an off-time. "
,,,,,"Menu is pretty simple, I got the Single Cheeseburger with a Fried Egg (+$1). It ended up being more food than I expected because the Single came with 2 burger patties! It was cool sitting at the bar since you got to see them making your burger. The patties were cooked to perfection, absolutely juicy and delicious. Buns were soft and the runny egg was a perfection addition. "
,,,,,TIPS: The Single Cheeseburger comes with 2 burger patties. 
,,,,,"I also got the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried farm egg to share. Pretty good, but overshadowed by the burger for sure. I think the fried egg is a must get with this burger, and I do regret not getting the bacon as well. In conclusion, it lives up to the hype, but definitely a pricey burger. A must try if you're a burger-fan!"
,,,,,"Horrible experience, way over rated. All I tased was nasty salt no flavor... and to top it off horrible costumer service."
,,,,,Would I say this is the best burger I've ever had and it changed my life? No but as far as burgers go this one ranks pretty high up there. Came here on a Friday for lunch and there was already a 2 hour wait. The place is tiny so be sure to check in and hang out somewhere else for the text saying your table is ready.
,,,,,Got the single cheesburger with bacon. A single here is 2 patties. The bacon is more of a porkbelly that is slightly sweet. So glad I got the bacon it really complemented the burger well. The cheese was nicely melted and the burger was super filling.
,,,,,Got a side a fries and they served it with aioli. The fries were average. Nothing too spectacular.
,,,,,"Overall, the meal was good. Would I wait 2 hours again for it? Probably not. But then again burgers are not my favorite food."
,,,,,"Best burger of my life! Even typing this, I'm drooling. Can't wait to find an excuse to go back. The service was incredibly thoughtful as they comped my bill to help my husband and me celebrate our new baby ( we went there on my due date.) As if the food wasn't already the best meal, that generous surprise and hospitality made this mama cry  tears of joy! Every bit worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Small place that specialize in burgers. Can be very crowded. Upbeat place, music and crowd. They do have a vegetarian option which is a triple decker grilled cheese-very good and a salad. The fries are splendid cooked in beef tallow/fat. The ginger ale is on point not too sweet."
,,,,,"Oh my lawwwddd. Got the single burger (really a double patty as others have noted), with egg, bacon, and foie gras. There are pickles and a sauce on it as well. I wouldn't change a thing about the burger. So juicy and flavorful. The egg (I'm normally weirded out by soft eggs) but this one was perfectly over easy. And finally, that foie grais. $9 upcharge, but idc idc. Just delicious."
,,,,,"Definitely wanted to order a second burger, but somehow managed to control my gluttony."
,,,,,Service was great. Vibe is very chill. There's bar seating but you need to ask to be seated. 
,,,,,I loooooove this place!!!
,,,,,"My goodness, this was the BEST burger I've ever had. Please add bacon as it just added on so many layers of flavor. Honestly, this is the hallmark burger for me now. I would go back to Chicago just for this burger."
,,,,,"The burger was SOO salty. Disappointing because I know it can be great. I've had the NYC version at 4 Charles and it was delicious. Hoping it was a one off fluke. The hash browns were dope, and they have an interesting breakfast beers menu. "
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,Went on a Sunday in January around 10:30am. No line.
,,,,,This is a meat lovers paradise which is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Even if you eat meat there's not much but beef and pork available. Smells amazing though and the crowd loved the burgers. 
,,,,,Despite that the place is a small first come first serve diner on popular Randolph Street. Not uncommon to wait an hour for a table for 4 but drinks are available and yummy while you wait. 
,,,,,The wings and hash brown with duck gravy were delicious! Also the prosecco and pink lemonade vodka.
,,,,,Mejor hamburguesa en America. It's a must try in Chicago and maybe the kitchen staff sprinkles magic powder on these burgers. 
,,,,,"Tried the cheeseburger with egg and bacon; holy, Angelina Jolie, every bite was to die for. It was almost tragic taking the last bite. Never a good time to say good bye. "
,,,,,The hype is real. Do yourself a favor and throw this on your Chicago itinerary.
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"It's truly a great burger. Don't mess around with the line stuff just order during corona and get it delivered, it takes waaaaay less time"
,,,,,Believe the hype.
,,,,,"I was visiting Chicago from San Diego, and of course I wanted to try one of the best burgers in America.  I did go into it skeptically - when I arrived in Chicago for a food tour of the city, I kept my plans for Au Cheval in my back pocket, but I was much more excited about dining at Girl & the Goat and The Purple Pig.  After all, sure it's probably a great burger, but how different could it *really* be compared to any other burger I've had?"
,,,,,"Turns out, extraordinarily and mind-blowingly different."
,,,,,"The Au Cheval single cheeseburger with bacon was my absolute single favorite dish of my entire trip, if not the best food I've had in years.  There are few dining moments in my life that provided as deeply satisfying and emotional an experience as my first bite into that burger."
,,,,,"My boyfriend wasn't able to join for my trip to Chicago, so I took each bite as slowly as I could (also to cherish that incredible burger) and to share my verbatim message to him in an attempt to describe its flavor: ""So you take a bite and it's a huge umami punch in the face, like as umami as straight MSG but better, then when you get past that it's really peppery and more 'ground beefy' then you get past that and it tastes like your tongue is coated in butter!!""  Beyond delicious!!"
,,,,,"I arrived a few minutes after opening on a Friday and luckily had no wait, although the place was packed by the time I left.  Even when they were getting super busy, the service was on point: timely, courteous, and thoughtful.  The bar was a fun place to sit, as you can see the magic happen; it's incredible to see how much work goes into each burger!  If I didn't appreciate their burger already from taste & quality alone, I appreciated it even more seeing how much dedication, talent, and labor goes into it."
,,,,,I'm sure I'll still dreaming about Au Cheval's cheeseburger for years to come!
,,,,,"Best Burger I have had HANDS DOWN!! Don't walk, RUN to this place because the food and staff are great but also the wait can be long on busy nights. Totally worth the wait and if they told the wait was 4+ hours long I would totally hold out for the food again."
,,,,,"I would actually give this place 5 stars but we were disappointed in part of the service.  Food was AMAZING, visiting from LA and this place was highly recommended. Attached is a photo of our food but we ordered along with a beer and an Iced Tea...which we never received. Our food was dropped and we asked our waitress if our drinks were coming, she replied ""on their way"". Meanwhile, the table next to us, sat at least 10 min later had their drinks. Finally we finished our food, still no drinks. I got up out of my seat and told the waitress ""never mind about the drinks, we are just about done"" she gave me an enthusiastic ""ok!"" No problem...we are both on the service industry and we are pretty mortified. I've forgotten stuff myself, I'm not perfect but I apologize. My fiancé is an over the top tipper. We went for wine and a cocktail while we waited a 1/2 hour to be sat. He tipped the guy 100%. This is the first time I've seen him tip 10% in the four years we've been together. Not pleased."
,,,,,"Really cool, dinner/speakeasy type of place...kinda like a throw back in time!! One of the best burgers I've ever had. Comparable to Small Cheval and The Dearborn, but in my opinion better. Drinks are pricey, but very well crafty and worth getting...at least 1! But what really blew me away was the general jane's fried chicken...OMG...AMAZING! Long story short, go during M-W, during lunch to avoid the 3 hour wait on the weekend (or go during non-peak hours). PRICEY, but a must for REAL foodies!!"
,,,,,The best burger in Chicago for a reason and 100% worth the wait. 
,,,,,"Went here on a Wednesday hoping to get a fast table, but the place was packed. Once on the list though there are a few bars in the area to wait, and the wait was much less than quoted."
,,,,,"While the place is quite small and a bit loud, you forget as soon as you are served. "
,,,,,"Ordered the cheeseburger, of course with a fried egg and bacon. Have been back for it many times and always recommend to friends visiting the area. On this visit we also tried the mornay fries, which were interesting and definitely worth a taste."
,,,,,Best burgers ever!!! Have been looking for a really great burger lately and this is the spot.
,,,,,"Line can be a little long but if you get there early you should be good. Burger is fantastic and worth eating with the bacon and egg. Flavors are unbelievable and the meat is texturally perfect. Also, the fries with aoli are delicious."
,,,,,Amazing atmosphere 
,,,,,Our server was super nice to us from his greeting to the end of our meal .
,,,,,The Au Cheval signature burger with bacon is the best of the west loop.
,,,,,I would definitely come back here
,,,,,"Some days, you want to eat light and some days you want to be fat and happy. It's 7 degrees right now, so definitely going with fat and happy!!!!!!"
,,,,,We had the general Janes fried chicken... to die for!!! The wait was about 35 minutes and so worthwhile. We followed the chicken with a double cheeseburger and rounded out with mornay and egg covered fries. 
,,,,,10/10 on the da and happy scale!!! Would go and wait again!!!!!!
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,wow wow wow.  The hype is real.  
,,,,,"Just a simple cheeseburger with a pickle.  BEST cheeseburger I've ever had in my life.  It was so good.  We got Au Cheval after having a full meal at girl & the goat, and it was STILL so good we finished most of it."
,,,,,"To put it simply, it lives up to the hype.  Best burger and fries you will ever eat.  Also the chicken appetizer is crispy and drenched in the most delicious sauce.  If you don't have 2 hours to wait for a table, small cheval is also amazing.  Just not AS amazing!"
,,,,,"The burger here was very good, but I wouldn't wait 2 hours for it.  I did wait an hour on this Saturday afternoon for a table since it was the main reason for the drive into the city.  They have a bar area, but that's part of the whole seating schema.  You put your name down and they text you when the table is ready.  You have 10 minutes to claim it after the text arrives.  I walked a couple of minutes to hangout at Whole Foods.  There's a nice bar and café inside."
,,,,,"The people working here were nice and friendly.  The restaurant is not that big, but the booth seating areas are comfortable.  The $12 cheeseburger comes with 2 patties and you can add bacon for $3.50.  The burger was juicy and delicious with a fluffy buttery bun.  The $10 fries with egg was good, but not for the price.  The $19 foie gras & scrambled eggs was savory and had a good texture.  The eggs were almost the consistency of noodles.  The bread that comes with it was crispy on the outside and buttery."
,,,,,"It cost about $16 to valet park.  Street parking on the side street is free, but hard to come by."

,,,,,"I have a set of friends that don't like going downtown because of parking, wait times, the drive distance, etc.. The only place they enjoy in this area is that place that puts a pizza in a bowl and bake it! Well, I am NOT gonna let them stop me from having a lovely evening @ Au Cheval, even if I have to do it alone."
,,,,,I can't find a better way of ending an evening of working two jobs and to celebrate Fat Tuesday than coming to this place late evening. No wait time after 10 pm. Got right in and got a seat at the bar :-)
,,,,,"Started off with a ""the ingenue"" beer. Delectable and delicious. I have to find out if they sell this stuff in stores! That is how good it was. If you are an IPA guy/gal, I recommend it. "
,,,,,"I ordered the single cheeseburger with bacon and fries. The cheeseburger is one of the best I have ever had (my reviews mentions the other, if you read them). The bacon is out of this world and makes the burger. The fries were just ok, but the aioli sauce made them better."
,,,,,"Nice, dark ambience and good, throwback hip hop played all night. Nice vibe."
,,,,,"While I was there enjoying the scene at the bar, I noticed the cooks making a sundae. Just simple ice cream and hot syrup. But they topped  it with the bacon from the burger! I said ""wow"". So I am looking at the server struggle with it because the bacon was falling out of the sundae. He caught it and set it back up, getting ready to serve it. Cool. Then he served it to me!!! I didn't even order it! They said it was to add to the good time I was already having and it was on the house! You can't get any cooler. I am not even a dessert person, but bacon on a sundae? How can you pass that up??? Delicious, for real!!!"
,,,,,"To get this VIP treatment, people, you have to go...""Downtown"" sung by Petula Clark."
,,,,,4.5 STARS
,,,,,"I've had Au Cheval on my Chicago list for some time, but never had a chance to check them out. Finally on Tuesday, December 5th around 11am, we stopped by. It was a chill morning, so fairly easy to get a table as they don't take reservations. The roommate and I didn't have to wait at all for our table of two."
,,,,,"*Roasted marrow bones, beef cheek marmalade & toast ($18.50)"
,,,,,"*Single cheeseburger ($11.95), add Egg (+$1), Bacon ($3.50)"
,,,,,"*Prosecco: drusian, treviso, italy, nv ($9 glass)"
,,,,,*Root beer: always on draught ($3.50)
,,,,,"Even though this was our brunch / lunch, I wanted to keep it light since we were going to eat more. (My vacations are always a food marathon, not a sprint.) I really wanted to try the eggs and foie gras, but since the roommate doesn't like foie, I refrained. The bone marrow was delicious! Four halves of rich meat butter! So good! The burger was tasty as well. Meaty, juicy, and comforting. Not the best burger I've ever had, but a pretty darn good one. My glass of bubbly was a good way to start the day. Since their root beer was highlighted on both sides of the menu, I suggested the roomie order it. I believe he liked it."
,,,,,Awesome place for a hearty meal. If only I had stomach room to try more. Maybe I can use it as an excuse to come back?
,,,,,Usually has a 3-4 hour wait. This is expected. There are fun bars in the area so we put our name down and walked to 2-3 bars before we got the text our table was ready. 
,,,,,It's a tiny place and very busy. I'm a vegetarian so I can't really speak for the burger (which is what people come here to eat). My friends like it so much and even ordered a second burger to split. 
,,,,,The menu is basic and doesn't have a crazy variety. I ordered the omelette And it was sooo delicious. It was definitely an experience. Very hyped up!
,,,,,Burger definitely lives up to the hype but is it worth the long wait? My advice is to stop by and put your name down and come back later. They use a cool text system that lets you know when your table is ready. 
,,,,,"While visiting Chicago, we ate there twice and was beyond satisfied both times. First time we sat at a table and the service was quick and helpful with the menu. They accommodated my non dairy request and showed me my options and it worked out perfectly. The second visit was great too but we sat at the counter and we felt overlooked at times waiting for a server. Had to get up and grab one a couple times but it's not a big deal, the restaurant seemed pretty busy. "
,,,,,Atmosphere was cool with the hip hop music and that upscale pub feel. We used the Divvy bikes to ride over and was super convenient because there's bike docks everywhere in Chicago 
,,,,,Definitely want to try the small Chevals next time in Chicago. Food overall was great and everyone was friendly and accommodating to my diet needs. The burger seems to be a Chicago staple and a must try if you are visiting.
,,,,,Most certainly a five star burger. 
,,,,,"To be completely honest, it was a bit much for me personally, as I don't usually enjoy my burger patties too thick with many topics, but it sure did taste delicious, trying a bite from my cousin's plate."
,,,,,My cousin ordered a single cheeseburger with bacon and an egg. I went for the chilaquiles (which were amazing)!
,,,,,"Wait is crazy long. My cousin and I waited almost 3 hours, but don't let that turn you away! I would absolutely recommend going, getting your name on the list (they will often give you an estimated wait time and text you), and head into downtown (about 10 min drive) to hang out and walk around. I parked in the Gold Coast neighborhood (right by the Waldorf Astoria Hotel) and hang out around the area. I'd recommend heading back about 1/2 hr. in advance of the estimated time they gave you as they will only hold your table for a limited time!"
,,,,,"And if you are not in the mood of going all the way into the city for AU Cheval's Burger, then just head on over to Small Cheval which will be sure to hit the spot!"
,,,,,"Eating here was something that I had been looking forward to for over a year! I had tried to get a seat three different times before I was finally successful! So to start, yes, this place ALWAYS has a wait... but they have a texting system in place so you can go somewhere and grab a drink if you want to while you wait. We had a drink outside the restaurant while we waited."
,,,,,The inside is pretty small & cramped but pretty cozy. All of the staff were really friendly & efficient!
,,,,,"We ordered the single cheeseburger (+egg & bacon) with a side of fries! The bacon was thick cut, sauce was perfect, the pickles added a nice crunch, and altogether is was pretty delicious! The fries came with a garlic aioli which made me happy but were a little too salty for our liking... I would try them again next time though!"
,,,,,I barely eat beef and this burger might convert me. Great for takeout when you can't get a spot inside. The fried chicken is greatly underrated!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"The burgers are good, but the hype is too high. I didn't have any complaints on service or taste. But it is ridiculous to wait like crazy when you can order from any of the small cheval locations"
,,,,,One of the best burgers in town. Super filling. Doesn't have reservations and the wait time is a minimum 1-1.5 hours. But worth it.
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I have ever had. My husband loves trying burgers and he was speechless. The ""single"" is actually a double so be hungry! This burger melts in your mouth. The cheese, the sauce, and the meat! YUM!! Everything about it is incredible. "
,,,,,"The fries with garlic aioli are amazing on there own! Did not care for the other sauce with them though. Can't wait to go back here! If you're looking to try this burger and don't want to wait, we went on a Sunday right when they opened. No wait at all for 2! So worth checking this spot out."
,,,,,"Burger perfection....come hungry, the single is a double Patty, add the bacon and egg. Definitely the bacon if you're not down with the egg though. It's big, and Rich so chomp a little pickle between bite to cut the fat..the fries were great but I was so full on the burger I wasted most of them so order accordingly. "
,,,,,"From a culinary perspective, I have to give hella kudos the the crew executing the food. A very keen attention to detail in every step and motion they make. No wasted movements. Completely focused on perfection. "
,,,,,I heard alot of hype before coming here and it lived up to and exceeded those expectations. Well done
,,,,,"P.S. I went on a Tuesday afternoon around 3 pm. No wait, relaxed spot at the bar, chatted up the chef and cooks. As a fellow chef I get wierd days/times off so for me this is normal dining hours. I understand the weekends will be crazy here so plan far ahead if you don't want to wait hours. I still say worth the wait no matter what, just know what you're getting into"
,,,,,SERVICE ONLY:
,,,,,"I understand this restaurant has truly made it, congratulations. Although if on average there is a 3 hour wait time, should this noted be posted on yelp? "
,,,,,"We called ahead of time yet no one answered or returned the calls. Checked on yelp, no wait list or reservation options so we took an Uber 30 mins out of our way to Au Cheval for an extraordinary burger (hubby has been here back in the day and vouches for ""best burger ever"")"
,,,,,Upon arrival we noticed there wasn't anyone waiting in front or by the host table. 
,,,,,"Walked up to the table when the host simply showed us his index finger, the universally rude way to say wait a moment. He then proceeded to finish his conversation with the other host, a few minutes pass as we awkwardly stare at them still a bit appalled at the way we were asked to wait.  Both hosts now stare at us, this must be a sign they are finished with their conversation, I asked for a table for two. They chuckled and said ""it'll be 3-5 hours"" "
,,,,,"Don't get me wrong, as a foodie I have no problem waiting for something yummy but this was just all around horrendous. There was NO ONE standing about, the restaurant didn't look packed at all, and what is up with the 2 hour gap in that wait time?"
,,,,,Needless to say we left with no intentions of going back.
,,,,,I was excited to go here because of all the hype about the burgers.  They were good but they are nothing life changing.  I would say go here... but don't get your hopes up.  There are better burgers to be found throughout Chicago
,,,,,"I really wanted this place to be as amazing as I had heard from so many people. And although everything was very tasty, I can't genuinely say I was blown away."
,,,,,"Let's start from the beginning. I came here on a Thursday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't too busy. I was pretty excited to try Au Cheval for the first time (and I was pretty hungry too, so I was very ready to chomp down on a good burger). My friend and I planned to meet here for dinner around 6, but she was running a little late because of traffic. The host said we'd be seating as soon as she arrived, but when she did get there, we ended up waiting for half an hour for our seats at the bar. Granted, the restaurant got a little busier by then, but it's a tad frustrating when you're expecting to be seated and that doesn't happen."
,,,,,"The place is extremely dark and cramped. I guess that's the vibe they're going for, but it didn't settle well with me. It was a mission to find/walk to the bathroom because it was so dark and there was hardly any space."
,,,,,"My friend and I decided to split the roasted marrow bones with beef cheek marmalade and a single cheeseburger with egg and bacon. The marrow dish was an interesting thing I've never tried before -- it's like a salty, fatty butter you spread on toast. Both dishes arrived very quickly and were delicious and filling. I can't deny that. But I ended up spending $46 for those two items. Now, I understand this is an upscale, popular place and I should be expecting to spend a little more. But in my opinion, the value of this meal was low because the quality just didn't match the price. "
,,,,,"I would never recommend anyone waiting more than an hour to get in here. If you're just looking for a good burger, check out Small Cheval. Slightly cheaper and way shorter wait time."
,,,,,BELIEVE THE HYPE.
,,,,,"After *only* and hour and a half wait on a Sunday afternoon, I had my doubts on whether this burger would be worth it. Let me tell you: IT IS. "
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the bun, to the pickles, to the magical sauce. And the BACON. It's thick and sweet and savory and beautiful in every way. "
,,,,,"We split fries and a salad with the other couple dining with us. They were both fantastic, but the burger was definitely the star of the meal."
,,,,,"I would do the wait all over again, and probably will since we live in the West Loop. Try going at a weird time and hanging out at a nearby bar to pass the time. Definitely worth it."
,,,,,"If you enjoy waiting, be my guest! These burger never disappoint. I kept it simple with a burger with bacon and side of my favorite fries, truffle. Not a big egg on burger girl. "
,,,,,"The wings wasn't very good so that was a little disappointing. Yes, there is a massive wait time. However if u can get to the bar your in business. Enjoy!!!"
,,,,,"Unfortunately we had high expectations from this location being that we love Small Cheval and frequent it when we are visiting Chicago. We had a 1.5 hour wait so of course by the time we were seated, our bellies were already waiting to be fed. The positive; the food came out super fast! The negative; we ordered two orders of fries, both which were super salty. I brought this to the attention of the Host because our waitress hadn't been seen for a while. The host apologized and asked if we wanted two new orders but I asked if he could just take it off the tab cause we didn't want to risk the chance of getting salty fries again. He said he'd do that for us which was super sweet of him. However, our waitress , when she finally showed up, said she overheard my conversation with the Host about the fries and she said she would take one off the bill because the host decided to bring us a fresh batch of fries anyway (1 order). So after going through all this, we were charged for the two fries when the host said he'd take them off but the waitress took it upon herself to do what she wanted with the bill. Frustrating & it wasn't worth it to point it out to her with the back and forth between us, the host and her. Also, we sat in the tent thinking there'd be heaters inside. It was FREEZING! Be prepared if you don't want to wait 2-2.5 hours for inside seating. You'll need to bundle up. The burger was great"

,,,,,I'm sure y'all already know. The burger is bomb.
,,,,,But have y'all had the matzoh ball soup?! 
,,,,,The Korean chicken wings are a must too!
,,,,,And WHAT is that sauce with the fries! 
,,,,,Also- the salted caramel gelato and dessert Godiva shot is bomb dot com!
,,,,,Best Burger I have ever had! Just get the single cheeseburger with bacon and egg (this is key) and you won't regret.
,,,,,"We walked in at around 5:30pm on a Friday, expecting a wait. But to our surprise, there were two empty seats at the bar, first come first serve! The excitement set in as we watched the cooks grill up the burgers, lay the cheese on, and brush maple syrup onto the bacon. We ordered fries, the burgers with egg and bacon, and hash browns. "
,,,,,"The fries were the best thing there. The garlic aioli was so good. The fries had that fresh potato taste, like In-n-Out fries, but were well seasoned."
,,,,,"The hash browns were thinly sliced, crunchy, but these were definitely overshadowed by the fries. The hash browns should come with the garlic aioli, because it would make anything good! "
,,,,,"The burger was piled high with two burger patties, cheese, pickles, onion, egg, and bacon. First bite, was surprised how sweet it was. The burger itself was juicy, but without the bacon, I would say it's similar to other high quality burgers in the same price range (~$20). The burger was interesting (sweet!) but I would definitely come back for the amazing fries alone."
,,,,,"Not really sure what all the hype is about this place. I stopped in on a weekend and the place was packed, I got the burger with some bacon on it and while it was good it wasn't really as good and it should have been based on all the reviews. "
,,,,,If you look at the picture of the omelette below you will see something that looks like plastic and didn't taste too much different.
,,,,,Freaking LOVED Au Cheval! Came here on a Thursday night around 8 with a friend and it was poppin - we put our names down and went to a bar nearby. Got called back around 45 minutes later and sat at the bar. 
,,,,,"We'd had some food at the previous bar and weren't too hungry, so we both ordered beers and I got the bone marrow and my friend got the french fries. He also ordered a root beer (they make it in-house!)."
,,,,,"This bone marrow was AMAZING. First off, it's four *hefty* bones. The bone marrow itself is super tasty, and it's served with toast and a tasty jam on the side. Such a memorable dish!!! Fries were delicious. "
,,,,,I've heard that the burger here is amazing. Wish I'd had a bigger appetite as I totally would've tried it -- next time in Chicago!
,,,,,We came on a Monday for lunch and had a 45 minute wait. 
,,,,,Worth the wait. The burger obviously is the hottest thing on the menu. The thick cut bacon almost tastes like a fatty brisket. The bun is sweet and amazing and the cheese with strong flavor. Every part of this burger makes the total thing a success.
,,,,,"My new favorite burger. Everything in the burger paired well together. I added the bacon since they don't include that with the burger anymore. The patty was juicy yet didn't fall apart. The sauce, the bun, the burger meat and the bacon were all excellent. Loved it."
,,,,,Holy burger! How does one describe Au Cheval in one word? AMAZING. This was my first time and I loved every second of it. A 45 minute wait didn't even seem long after having a drink next door and once seated I was excited to sink my teeth into their famous burgers. I was NOT disappointed. I ordered and single cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg and it was lit! Lol I'm not over it yet! I highly recommend this location for the best burger in Chicago. 
,,,,,Super side note: a single burger is a double and a double burger is a triple. Thank me later :)
,,,,,"After reading all the reviews at how busy this place tend to get, my sister and I decided to come when they first open. We arrived around 15 minutes after 10 and there was already 10 people sitting and eating! I mean, who usually eat burgers before 11???? And after we left around 11, the place was packed."
,,,,,"We ordered the basic single cheeseburger with egg and bacon and omg it was amazing. First off, it was very instagramable (see picture) and secondly, it was probably #2 in rankings on my favorite burgers of all time. The egg was cooked perfectly that when you cut it,it was oozing nicely. The bacon was thick cut and almost like pork belly texture but was packed with flavor. The first bite into the burger was heavenly. The Sweetness from the bacon balance the saltiness of the beef Patty and the meet was juicy. I also like the perfect amount of toppings/sauce that came with the burgers. I usually have to add ketchup to most burgers but I did not have to or want to with this burger because I was afraid it would ruin the flavors."
,,,,,"So, why not a 5? Because I'm comparing this burger to my favorite burger place and the burger itself is comparable, but I'm basing my rating on everything, and with this place, the price is a little higher and it doesn't come with fries or anything. The service was also just ok, nothing exceptional. If it was just based on the burger itself, it would be a 5."
,,,,,"Be prepared to wait for seating here. The place isn't that big, so it takes a while before you get seated. We tried the single cheeseburger and added the bacon and fried egg. It was definitely a tasty burger. We also ordered the bone marrow; the jam that came with the bone marrow had great flavor."
,,,,,Wow. Amazing burger!!!
,,,,,"The portions are HUGE too so be sure to bring a +1. This is definitely a cheat day meal. I'm surprised a ""single cheeseburger"" contained 2 patties... haha."
,,,,,"Also, be sure to get the fries with the garlic aoli dip. The dip is suuuper garlicky and flavorful. Yum."

,,,,,Everything here was so good here. The burger was so juicy and delicious. It's a must try if you like burgers.
,,,,,Don't believe the hype. It's a decent burger but far from being the best burger in the country and definitely not worth the wait. Thousands of yelpers have described the burger already and for me there is nothing standing out to highlight in my review. 
,,,,,While my burger was ok my wife's was strangely salty in few places. Fries were also just average and nothing to rave about. 
,,,,,This is your typical make people feel they are part of an exclusive group that had to wait hours to get a burger so it must be really good. I'd rather go to a hole in the wall or epic burger and get a solid burger than come here. Sorry Au Cheval but we can't be friends.
,,,,,"One of the best burgers I've ever had! It took me awhile to finally try Au Cheval because there's usually a wait and they don't take reservations, but I'm glad my time finally came. It was worth it! To make sure you keep wait times slim, try to go on weekdays during slow times (like right when it opens!)"
,,,,,"If you decide to add bacon to your burger, keep in mind the bacon is thick cut. For me, I definitely liked that it was so, but it might throw you off if you weren't expecting it!"
,,,,,I definitely recommend coming here if you have the chance!
,,,,,"Finally got to eat here for lunch yesterday!!  They don't take reservations, and the wait is horrendous, so we weren't sure if we could get a table in a reasonable amount of time, but we did!  We arrived at noon on Saturday and put our name down for 2, and they texted us in 1.5 hours.  "
,,,,,"There is a cool app that comes with the initial text, so you can see how many parties are ahead of you in real time.  Excellent customer service expectation management!  "
,,,,,"Make sure you don't venture too far while you are waiting though, because they'll only hold your seat for 10 minutes after texting you that your table is ready.  Thankfully there are lots of bars and we found a cool coffe shop nearby to hang out at while we were waiting."
,,,,,"Of course I had to try the famous cheeseburger Au Cheval, and it was amazing.  I don't like runny eggs, so I only added the bacon for $3.50.  It was still brunch menu time when we ate, so I got hash browns on the side."
,,,,,"The single burger comes with two thin patties, and the double has 3 patties--but it's still about the same amount of meat as a normal single and double in other places, so don't get tripped up by the numbering.  "
,,,,,"It was perfectly cooked and juicy, with yummy sauce, a sweet bread bun, bits of chopped red onion and thinly sliced cucumber instead of lettuce for a refreshing crisp crunch.  Came with a crisp dill pickle on the side."
,,,,,The bacon was two slices of thick cut meat with a slightly sweet taste--maybe maple syrup glazed?  So yummy.  
,,,,,"The hash browns were really oily but had a very nice crunch with lots of crispy bits.  It was a bit rich, so I couldn't finish the whole dish, but I did manage to eat most of it, lol. "
,,,,,"The food ain't cheap, but it's really rich and delicious, so totally worth coming here for a decadent splurge."
,,,,,"Without much left to be added to the 4000+ positive reviews, I'd like to just confirm that the hype is well deserved and Au Cheval's burgers deliver! It's far from the best ever, but it is delicious and a solid choice. "
,,,,,"As there are no reservations, be prepared to wait. For a while. We waited 2 hours for lunch for a table of 4 on a Sunday and that was supposedly fast. Sadly, being from the SF Bay Area, I didn't mind much but I can see how many others may be turned off. Don't be and stick it out!"
,,,,,Keep in mind that they don't serve their full menu at lunch until I believe 5PM. The burger is on it though so don't worry!
,,,,,I got the single (it's actually 2 patties) cheeseburger with bacon and egg. The patties were juicy with perfectly broiled texture. The cheese was melted at just the right temperature where it still maintained some structural integrity for it not to just slide away. It was more on the medium than the medium rare side but the flavor was still there. The bacon was thick and crispy with just the right amount of fat. The egg was slightly runny as it should have been. 
,,,,,We got fries on the side too and they were good. The garlic aioli made them even better.
,,,,,We had a few other dishes and they were just OK honestly. They wouldn't make me come back like the burger would.
,,,,,The service could also use some improvement as it was subpar. 
,,,,,"Overall, all those can be mostly overlooked as quite frankly, you are here for the burger and everybody knows that."
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten! Just do yourself a favor and experience it, so worth the wait. "
,,,,,"Also, great staff that made the experience even more enjoyable."
,,,,,Burger was delicious. Bacon was tasteful. Drinks were good. Definitely one of my favorite spots (top five) for a burger.
,,,,,Drove 2 hours to give them business and they wouldn't take my to go order due to how busy to go order was. I understand the being busy part but living in California I never had this Situation where they wouldn't take my order to go. I was okay to wait the 40 minutes but why not just take my damn order? When you get this popular customer service should be just as good as the food. This was my 2nd time coming here and each time it felt like they didn't want our business. Such a shame. Also fix your online order. Some of us are allergic to certain things you add to the burger. It would be nice if there was opportunity for modifications so I didn't have to drive 2 hours then wait another hour and half hour to place order.
,,,,,"Absolutely worth the long wait each time... definitely the best burger I've had in Chicago! Plan your day around going because it'll be time consuming, but you won't regret it!"
,,,,,"The food's great! But sincerely, everything else about this place is awful. They don't take reservations - fine. They don't pick up the phone, ever - fine. In order to dine there, you need to arrive in person, put your name down, and wait anywhere from 2-4 hours - fine. If you don't arrive within 5 minutes of the scheduled call, you forfeit your table - fine. All of this is dandy. But if you try to get takeout? Well, enjoy battling an online portal that constantly shuts down because they are at capacity. Fine. Tonight I had my family in town and tried to show them a great meal, and so I walked all the way to Au Cheval to place a takeaway order. I was told that they were no longer doing takeaway orders - ever. Apparently COVID had forced them to make good, customer friendly decisions, and now they no longer need to do those things. There is no indication of this policy change anywhere on the website, or when you call. Only when you arrive and the host tells you you've wasted your time coming here. What a lovely experience."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"My group of friends and I heard that Au Cheval had one of the best burgers that you would ever eat. I though that was a pretty bold statement, so we had to go and see what all the hype was all about. "
,,,,,"Depending on what time you go (pretty much all the time), expect a line. I always have a saying, that if there is a line, there's a line for a reason, and I understand after eating their food. Our wait was about 1.5 hours on a Tuesday afternoon when we went around 5. They text you when your table is ready, so your whole party doesn't have to be present when you put your name down. If there are other places around that you want to go visit, while you wait would be the perfect time to do so. Once our party was called, the excitement for food came upon us. "
,,,,,"When we sat, the menu isn't that extensive and is not overwhelming because of it. Their burger menu is fairly simple, either a single or double cheese burger, and you have the option of adding bacon or an egg. I personally got the egg, and someone in my party got it with bacon, and I can say you can't go wrong with adding either or both. A lot of other items on the menu looked really good, but we all got the burgers since that's what we were looking forward to. Since our party wasn't too hungry, we decided to share 2 orders of fries for 6 people, but I think we could have done 3 as well. We ended up getting one order of the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and an egg with one order of regular french fries. We didn't think the special fries were worth the extra money, it's better to just get regular fries and ask for garlic aioli, which is where the real deliciousness is. When the burgers came out, it seemed everything was cooked perfectly. I didn't think that it was possible, but the bread was toasted perfectly, the patty was juicy & soft, and even the pickles weren't too sour. Everything combined made it the perfect culmination of flavor and texture. As my beverage of the night, I got their root beer on tap, which tasted like the standard root beer you could get at the store, but was richer than any other sort of root beer I have ever had, wasn't too sweet, and didn't have any strange flavors to it. Overall, my group and I thought our meal was amazing, and wish we had more opportunities to get other things on the menu, but the burger was well worth it."
,,,,,"The single cheeseburgers are actually doubles and the doubles are actually triple. The bacon is THIIIICK & everything is amazing! My boyfriend and I had the single cheeseburger and added bacon onto it, the general jane's honey-fried chicken, & some crispy fries. Everything was DELICIOUS & I wish there was one in Miami. I forgot to take a picture of the honey fried chicken from how good it was. I'm definitely going back to Au Cheval."
,,,,,"Really good burger but I don't know if I'd be willing to wait hours for it. Come during a weekday at like 10 or 11 am, or another off time if you can."
,,,,,"As others have mentioned, a ""single"" is actually two patties. I got a single with added egg and bacon, both of which were excellent. The bacon is so thick that it's almost like adding another patty -- I would say this was my favorite part of the burger. The actual beef was a tad salty at first but somehow mellowed out as I kept eating. It's a huge burger for a decent price, considering Au Cheval's prestige. I also tried a root beer float, which was really good. "
,,,,,"Overall I would definitely come back, but only at an off time again."
,,,,,Context: Late Night Grub with the boys! Wednesday around 10:30/11 PM. Such a great idea. (Post grabbing drinks around town)
,,,,,Food & Drink: The food was amazing at this time! Everyone at the table was quiet and enjoying their burgers. The bacon was nice and thick! I also LOVED the fries. NOTE: single burger has two patties and double has three
,,,,,Other: I will definitely be coming back here for a late night eat - so it isn't as crowded!!!
,,,,,"I've tried coming here a couple times but could never bare the wait time. Finally, my fiance and I came on a Wednesday night and the wait was expected to be an hour and a half. We went to the bar across the street, but to our surprise, we were texted that our table was ready within 30min!"
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow, burger with the fried egg and bacon, and a side of fries. The bone marrow was really good and jam was very flavorful. The burger definitely lived up to the hype - so simple, but so flavorful! The fries were a disappointment in my opinion. I love fries but these just did not live up to the hype and were not worth the price if you ask me."
,,,,,"Note: The ""single burger"" comes with two patties!"
,,,,,"First time at Au Cheval last night at almost midnight. I've heard this place has arguably the best burgers in Chicago, and that there is a hard time getting in, due to wait times.  "
,,,,,"When we came, there was a small wait; we were quoted 15-30 mins, but within 5 minutes there was seating available! - score!  "
,,,,,"The restaurant was quite busy, considering it was a Sunday night.  "
,,,,,"The server, Nick, was kind and attentive! He gave recommendations and even let us know that the ""single"" burger has two patties and the ""double"" had three. -I'm glad he did!  "
,,,,,We ordered burgers and fries with garlic aioli. 
,,,,,"Burgers were cooked perfectly and so filling!  I love the patties, they aren't too thick like pub burgers. "
,,,,,"I informed the server it was my boyfriends birthday and he arranged a little something. Although another employee forgot to bring out the candles, they still comped the gelato - thank you! "
,,,,,"The atmosphere was dark but loud, and lively!"
,,,,,"Went at 10 am and got seated right away but soon the line started to form outside, so go early! "
,,,,,Fried House-made Bologna Sandwich 11.95: Bf enjoyed it a lot. He actually liked it more than the burger here.
,,,,,Single Cheeseburger 11.95 Add Bacon 3.50: Single means 2 patties. Love the thick bacon! 
,,,,,Crispy Potato Hash With Duck Heart Gravy 10.95: Decent. The hash was very crispy but gravy was a bit bland.
,,,,,Open late in Chicago.  I would describe it as a foodie dinner.  Mostly known for its burgers and I hear they are amazing.  And as the name says a fried egg on top. Everything fried is done in beef fat.  They have one vegan options (salad). I opted for the omelette and it was perfectly prepared and melt on your mouth delicious!
,,,,,Food came out fast and the service was on point!
,,,,,"Tasty Burger. Single comes with two patties! Bacon is extra thick and the egg was runny. Excellent! Fries came with egg. Limited 3pm - 5pm menu and the wait was two hours. They don't take reservations, but with all that in mind I highly recommend. Also, the music was hip"
,,,,,Hop and loud. Unique.
,,,,,super juicy burger and crispy fries..how can u go wrong. they are pricey but definitely worth each bite!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Best burger not even kidding! 
,,,,,Best tips: 
,,,,,*expect a wait although we were sat within 10 min after being told 1.5 hours! I think that was unusual!
,,,,,*Gluten free no problem order a crispie which is an amazing crispy hash brown patty on bottom of burger patties! See picture 
,,,,,*order jalapeños or extra pickles on side 
,,,,,*single patty is actually served as a double patty and a double patty is served as a triple so beware! 
,,,,,* I was actually glad my order got messed up and I didn't get the bacon bc I enjoyed the burger without that thick cut bacon on it! 
,,,,,^bc gluten free they served daughter gelato w a sparkler bc they care and provide excellent serbide! 
,,,,,Our waiter Jordan was exceptional - just so personal and helpful!! When he went on break while we were there we actually missed him lol 
,,,,,This is a must experience type of place! Trust me
,,,,,"I haven't tried all the burgers in Chicago, so I couldn't say that At Cheval's is the best, but I can tell you that it is a delectable burger and a must-try if you're in the city and enjoy burgers. My usual order is the single cheeseburger, which I find to be a satisfactory portion, and I strongly recommend adding the fried egg and thick cut peppered bacon (which is a wonderfully juicy highlight of the burger in itself). "
,,,,,"Wait times are typically shorter than they quote, but can be incredibly long during traditional meal times and on the weekends. My first attempt at visiting was thwarted by an estimated wait of 3 hours on a weekend at around lunch time. My second try was more successful and our table was seated within 45 minutes after having been quoted a wait time of 1.5 hours. As it was late afternoon on a weekday, we entertained ourselves at a neighboring bar's happy hours. My third visit was just after opening time on a weekday and we were seated without a wait."
,,,,,"This is definitely a good burger. It might even make your top 5. Although it was tasty, I got the plain burger with the beef and fried egg, and it really was not special. After waiting three hours in a local coffee shop nearby, I would really expect this to blow my mind but it was like just a good burger. The fries we ordered were good additions. They definitely have their technique down, but I would not wait this long for an Au Cheval burger again. It felt like we were in and out, which makes sense due to the wait, but it was not an extraordinary dining experience with extraordinary food, so don't have enormous expectations but do expect a good burger out of it."
,,,,,"We waited this long because we were Chicago tourists, but I would not imagine the average city dweller to have the time to wait for this unless they were showing someone around."
,,,,,"After two failed attempts to come, I was able to dine here on the last day of my trip to Chicago. For those who don't know, its 1st come 1st serve and there are waits for up to 4 hours during dinner rush. For example, the first time we went it was at 7:45pm and they said they may not be able to sit us... they close at midnight. "
,,,,,"They are acclaimed as being THE BEST burger in the world. I can say this, for what I have tasted I can agree. They deliberately char their buns to accentuate other flavor tones, which is incredibly innovative. It's dimly lit, and feels like almost a speak easy but for food. They serve beer, and for being regarded as the best burger in the world their prices points are incredibly reasonable ($12 dollar burger)."
,,,,,"The burger itself was so juicy, comes with an egg which I love. There's truly no condiments needed and it's perfectly cooked and has a hint of sweetness. I salivate just writing this. "
,,,,,150% you must go. Even if it takes multiple attempts to get in. Put your name in and then grab a drink at areas nearby.
,,,,,"Two different friends from Chicago recommended eating at Au Cheval, so I had to try. Went at noon on a Thursday, but there was still a projected hour long wait. The host stand is on the right hand side kind of hidden away, so if you see a crowd of people waiting inside, just pass them to put your number down and have them text you. We walked to the Chicago French Market which was a 10 minute walk away to grab something to nibble on, but our table was surprisingly ready in 30 minutes. They hold your table for 10 minutes. "
,,,,,"We sat at the bar and a jug of water was provided by one of the chefs at the bar/open kitchen area but a waitress came by separately to take our order. We split a single cheeseburger and the crispy fries. The burger was good and came with two patties (~$15) plus cheese. You could add bacon or a fried egg for an additional cost - I wish we added the bacon but it was good without it. The crispy fries were good too but I wasn't a fan of the cheese sauce - there wasn't really flavorful and I preferred the garlic aioli sauce. It was cool seeing the chefs make the food - they have tiny pans that hold a single egg, so you know they do take their eggs seriously. I think the place was overhyped by my friends, so while it was certainly good food, it wasn't ""as amazing"" as I was expecting. I think this restaurant is Michelin Bib Gourmand too so it is a good spot to go try on a weekday where the wait won't be as terrible as it would be on the weekend. Overall, glad I got to try this place, but perhaps moderate your expectations."
,,,,,It really was one of the best burgers I have ever had!! 
,,,,,I came in at about 12:15 on a Monday afternoon. The host informed me there was someone leaving soon and I could have the spot at the counter. I waited about 7 min after that before he sat me. Everyone that works here is super friendly! I wanted to be friends with the host!! 
,,,,,"As I mentioned above this was one of the best burgers I have had hands down. I got a single with bacon and the egg. I can't believe I am about to say this, but despite the bacon being very good, I actually think the burger was better without it. I ended up taking it off and eating it separately. The slaw/sauce they add to the burger just has such a great flavor along with the yolk from the egg! I'm glad I stopped in to try this!!"
,,,,,I wish I was hungrier. I really wanted to try the wings!!
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I have ever had. If you don't get the burger from here... well, you're committing a crime. Add the bacon and egg, you won't regret it."
,,,,,Amazing staff and super polite and professional. The interior aesthetic is also very charming. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was one of the best I've ever had. For food I ordered the Duck Heart Hash which was pretty good. 
,,,,,"I spontaneously dropped in, and did not have to wait because there luckily was a seat at the bar. Solo travelers can likely wait less than an hour to eat, but beware larger groups. "
,,,,,"It's open kitchen, and at counter I liked watching them prepare the food but you will smell like burgers after you leave."
,,,,,Pro Tip: Their satellite location Small Cheval serves the burgers and shakes with little to no wait time and outdoor patio seating if trying the burger is on your Chicago list but you don't want to do the line.
,,,,,Definitely a great vibe at this restaurant. The service is spectacular and the music is awesome :) I got to try the single cheeseburger + bacon($4.50extra) I also tried General Janes Chicken. Big pieces of a chicken in a sweet soy sauce. (Salty) wouldn't recommend
,,,,,The burger is really good but I didn't like the pickle onion relish (if you don't like pickles you won't like it it's very pickley) the bacon is a big thick slab of bacon (mediocre)
,,,,,Good burger unfortunately would never ever wait more then 45 mins! I can't believe people waited over 2 hours!
,,,,,"So, yes. You will wait. And you will wait a long while for your burger... but it is delicious. Truly. "
,,,,,"What you should do is NOT what my companion and I did: go and put your name down on a Saturday night at 7:00 pm aka prime dinner time. What we should have done is to come for lunch the day before, on a Friday, when more people are working than not (presumably). Anyway- we were quoted a 3.5hr wait, and we were like, ""Sure......we'll eat our dinner at 10:30pm......"" "
,,,,,"What we did was to walk over to Goose Island Brewery, maybe a mile and a half away and enjoyed a beer, and then lyfted back when our table was ready. "
,,,,,We both ordered the cheeseburger au cheval (with fried egg on top) and the fancy fries - what I'm construing as their version of poutines. Delicious. The whole lot. 10/10 recommend.

,,,,,"The burger is amazing PERIODT.   The wait staff is awesome, sit at the bar so you can watch it all happen and you won't be disappointed!"
,,,,,Waited around 2 hours. We got a text saying our table was ready so we just walked around the area since there were a lot of bars/restaurants in West Loop
,,,,,What we ordered: Single Cheesburger ($11.95) + Egg ($1) + Bacon ($3.50) | Chocolate Martini Shot ($4)
,,,,,Taste: Lots of flavor and the sauce was really good with the burger. The shot tasted like a chocolate drink. pretty good!

,,,,,"The wait can be very long (2 hours @ 11:30am on a Saturday) so I would suggest walking around West Loop in the meantime. Or do like me, take a trip to Goose Island Brewery (1.5 miles away) and drink the exclusives until your seat is ready.  SUPER SOLID 5 STARS."
,,,,,Orgasm. In. Your. Mouth. 
,,,,,*insert clap hands.
,,,,,Worth. The. Wait.
,,,,,*insert clap hands.
,,,,,PRO (just) the tip - put your name in and hit up all the amazing bars nearby to get nice and primed before smashing all the meats.
,,,,,XOXO.
,,,,,I've been coming here for years with my dad and it is easily the best burger in Chicago. The staff is all so friendly and the environment of the restaurant is beautiful. The thick cut bacon and egg on the burger adds so much flavor and the food is definitely worth the wait. I recommend this place to all my friends and family!
,,,,,Um.  Yes.  Just yes.  
,,,,,One of the best burgers you'll ever have. 
,,,,,It's worth going out of your way for.  And it's worth the wait if there's a line (and there will be)
,,,,,5 stars from this burger snob!
,,,,,"After a day of walking around Chicago, we decided that Au Cheval would be the perfect spot to stop and grab dinner before heading to a comedy show. Don't anticipate walking in and grabbing a table without a wait - we went over around 5 and the wait was already about an hour. But trust me, it's worth the wait. "
,,,,,"We were seated and the waiter immediately brought over a jug of water (perfect for a really hot day). We were basically ready to order and my friend and I got a single burger with bacon and an egg (I learned that au cheval means ""a fried egg on top"" in French when talking about food). We also ordered crispy fries which were served with mornay sauce and a fried egg. "
,,,,,"I'm glad that we chose to share these two dishes because the burger was huge! The fries were also AMAZING - as we ate more of them, I was actually sad that they were almost gone. LOL. "
,,,,,"Like I said, you may have to wait, but it's worth it."
,,,,,"I don't know if it was because there was so much hype, but I was pretty disappointed by the food. "
,,,,,We went around 5 and there was a thirty minute wait so we grabbed a couple drinks until we got the text that our table was ready. The interior is cozy and dim and feels more sophisticated than the usual burger joint. 
,,,,,We got the double cheeseburger with bacon and egg - the cheeseburger looks amazing with the thick slabs of bacon and sunny side up egg. But then the taste just didn't translate through. It was a decent burger but nothing special or wow worthy. The cheese overpowered the other flavors in the bacon and sauce. I would honestly prefer Small Cheval with the no wait and more relaxed atmosphere. The fries were nicely cooked with a good crunch but were drowning in so much salt that it was painful to eat them. 
,,,,,I'm glad I tried Au Cheval since there's so much talk about it but will probably go to Small Cheval or Kumas next time I want a burger.

,,,,,I'd hate to give a bad review during these hard times but I honestly wonder who runs this place. On a normal non-covid day it takes them hours to get in and they don't do take out. 
,,,,,"Now that they are forced to do takeout, they absolutely suck! I order at tons of places for takeout and they by far are the worst! They have no system in place as ordering online is no help because you  still have to wait 1-2 hours outside or in your car even though your order says it's ready. It's not right somebody has to get it together here. And when you ask someone here they say ""oh nothing I can do, everything is backed up."""
,,,,,Their food is good but the wait time is so ridiculous and so disorganized.
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,- Single Patty Burger with egg 
,,,,,- Single Patty Burger with egg and bacon - Amazing! The bacon was to die for!
,,,,,- Pink Vodka Lemonade ($13.50) - The drink was extremely smooth and tasted like pink lemonade!
,,,,,- Root Beer Float - It was high quality root beer with amazing vanilla ice cream.
,,,,,Presentation: It came on a regular white plate and the drinks came in a clean regular cup.
,,,,,"Taste: It was an amazing burger. It was juicy, sweet, and tender. There was no overwhelming flavor."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Atmosphere and Decor: It is darkly lit, and super crowded. We got here and there was a three hour wait. However, there are four seats by the door that are first come first serve so we swooped two seats after waiting twenty minutes."
,,,,,"I'm always SUPER skeptical of places with a 2-3 hour wait. Like c'mon. It can't be THAT good. I love being proved wrong. Not only was the wait worth it, but I would wait it again. "
,,,,,Come in and put your name down. They will text you when a table is ready and you have ten minutes to get there. The weather sucked the day we went so we went two doors down to the Lone Wolf and had a few drinks. Our three hour wait turned into a blessed two hour and twenty minute wait. 
,,,,,We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the chefs. The drinks are superb. So many cocktails still to try! I had the punch #3 and it was delish. JH had the cheeseburger (definitely a reason they are famous for this) and I had the Bone Marrow with toast. SO GOOD. It was my first time ever having that type of dish but it for sure hit the spot. We finished off the night with a Root Beer Float. DYING. NEED. 
,,,,,"The service is amazing and so friendly. They really exude team work. The ambiance is dim, broody, classy and perfect for date night. "
,,,,,We had such a great time here and can't wait to come back.
,,,,,Au Cheval does a great burger albeit not worth the 3 hour wait. Go to Small Cheval in old town if you want to skip the long wait instead. Their bacon (more like pork belly) is really good by the way. I got the fries with garlic aioli and the single burger with egg (comes with two patties). Loved the cheese and sunny side up egg added something extra to the burger!
,,,,,"No sure why the lack of 5 stars, this place lives up to the hype and even their insane 3.5 hour wait time. They mastered the art of a perfect simple cheeseburger! Do yourself a favor, make a reservation and come here!!! "
,,,,,Every time I come to Chicago I've tried to eat here and have refused the insane wait - this time I was with the hubby and there was no convincing him to bail.
,,,,,"Don't let the small quaint atmosphere fool you ( I mean I def questioned ""what could be so great about these burgers"" multiple time ) anyway finally put my name down and waited the 3 hours. I went to two surrounding bars/restaurants to waste time, these did no disappoint - so the area is nice if you want to spend some time there or have time to kill."
,,,,,"Finally the text message system they have told us we only had 3 tables in-front of us, when we arrived we still had to wait another 30 minutes. Finally we sat down and Holy Jesus.... blown away."
,,,,,"Every table around us had ordered the Bone Marrow, so we of course did the same and this take a solid 20 out of 5 - please don't even hesitate to order this - I've never been so happy to slurp on fat lol. The flavors where beautiful, the toast perfectly buttered and toasted, and the marmalade that came with it could be eaten on its own."
,,,,,"Single cheeseburger - 5/5 - actually brings two patties and not one. Comes with pickles and some type of mayo, they were cooked to perfection.. and just the combo and simplicity of the flavors where perfect "
,,,,,"Fries 5/5 - maybe we were high off the food at the point, but even the fries were Incredible simple and good! "
,,,,,"Just come - make a reservation or wait the line, theres no way you'll leave out of here disappointed. The prices are good too."
,,,,,"This is an ok burger, not worth close too $30."
,,,,,"Ordered to go could not get any ketchup or napkins. I choose the works plus egg and bacon.(very messy without napkins). The fries by far were the worst I have ever had. Better choices Meatheads, or Little Bad Wolf if looking for bar scene. Use extra savings on drinks."
,,,,,"My friend and I checked in at 3pm on a Saturday and got seated around 4:15. We both ordered single cheese burgers (two patties) with bacon and egg, plus a side of fries to share. I also ordered a glass of their root beer on tap. "
,,,,,"My favorite items in order: root beer, fries, burger. Yes, my favorite item here was the root beer. It was just sweet enough and not syrupy at all. As for the food, the fries were decent -- they a good crisp on them and were served with a tasty garlic aioli. The burger, however, was disappointing. First off, the burgers came out extremely fast -- within 10 minutes of ordering. The bun had a greasy shine to it and was slightly toasty. The patties were not juicy and tasted quite peppery. The star of the burger was the bacon, which essentially was a slice of pork belly, except I liked it best off the burger. To me, the bacon added a sweetness to the burger that didn't work well with dijonnaise sauce or pickles. My main issue was that the burger lacked freshness, almost as if it was under a heat lamp with the toppings added just before serving. I'm hoping I came on an off day, as the burger was underwhelming. "
,,,,,"Overall, if I do end up at Au Cheval again, I will skip the burger and try out their other offerings, or just hit up Small Cheval for a shorter wait."
,,,,,It's been years since my visit. 
,,,,,I remember waiting 2.5 hours to get a table for 2 on a Saturday. 
,,,,,"When we finally sat down and the cheeseburger arrived, I remember feeling a little underwhelmed by the actual burger "
,,,,,"It was good, but not 2.5 hour wait good."
,,,,,"Have been to small Cheval many times but this one is way way better!  Absolutely mind blowing taste, although the waitress needs to work on her memory lol."
,,,,,"While visiting Chicago, I didn't cross my mind that I'd end up having the best restaurant burger - ever. "
,,,,,"A friend recommended Au Cheval, and went to be met with a four hour wait - but even our Uber driver was excited and envious for us so we decided to wait. Took advantage of the four hours with some sigh seeing as the restaurant is located relatively close to anywhere you would want to visit (or you can drop into any of the bars in the area)."
,,,,,"Finally we got the text, it was our turn and we rushed back - hungrier then ever. Seated at the bar, we ordered burgers, fries and the duck heart gravy hash. "
,,,,,"The beauty of the restaurant goes beyond the food, as the burgers are made right behind the counter and the food is presented immediately thereafter. "
,,,,,"The fries were delicious, which was followed with the duck heart hash. With one bite, we knew the wait was well worth it and we devoured the plate, planning on when we would be able to come back to have more. Thinking it would not get better than this, we were surprised at the tasty burger with the thick cut bacon presented next. Juicy, well seasoned and prepared to perfection, not like other restaurant burgers. "
,,,,,"If you're in Chicago, add this to the lists of MUSTS!"
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,It was really good! Probably not worth the price but I have no regrets. The single burger had three patties (yes that is correct... three). The egg fries were delicious. The burger was super good. I am glad I went!
,,,,,Pro tip: go on a weekday at 10 am so there's no line.
,,,,,"We got the burger with bacon and egg and also the fries. The fries were okay, nothing special, and the burger was just so dense I ate it for 3 meals. Maybe it was because it was so early in the morning but it just felt too heavy and oily for my taste."
,,,,,Two things which you should understand about Au Coeval:
,,,,,"- The ""single"" burger is actually still 2 patties. "
,,,,,- The bacon is amazing.
,,,,,"Yes you're going to wait when you come here. We put our name in on a Friday around 5p and were told we'd have a 1-1.5 hour wait. The awesome thing about this place is that you'll be able to see how many parties are ahead of you, they'll text you when it's your turn to sit and you'll have 15 minutes to make it to the restaurant after you receive the text."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"Burgers are amazing. The bacon is amazing. The truffle fries are amazing. The salad is amazing. Seriously, everything is amazing. "
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"You wouldn't expect there to be amazing service at a burger joint but I was absolutely delighted by the service here. We came in a group of 4, and one of my friends ordered a burger not expecting there to be cheese on it since it's not a ""cheeseburger"" (he's lactose intolerant). The waiter explicitly asked if there were any allergies while taking our orders, to which the table said no. When my friend's burger arrived and he saw the cheese on top he began scraping it off. Our waiter was extremely thoughtful and took his burger away to get a new burger made without cheese for my friend- even though it was completely his fault for specifying not to have cheese on the burger. My friend even told the waiter that he could just scrape the cheese off but our waiter insisted on having a new one made for him. Was very impressed with the whole experience!"
,,,,,"HOLY MOTHER OF BURGERS! I wasn't sure what to expect from all this hype - especially with a burger. I mean, what else can you add to a burger that makes it unbelievably bomb? I was such a happy girl! This was the best THICK, sweet, savory, crunchy bacon that I've ever tasted in my entire life on a burger. I never finish a whole burger in one sitting, but I didn't have trouble this time! "
,,,,,The seasoning was perfect on the beef patty. The egg was super runny and creamy. The bacon made it 100. This is the real definition of an explosion of flavors in your mouth. SKIP out on the fries. It was too salty. 
,,,,,I recommend to arrive exactly at 10am. I got there at 10:15am due to traffic on a Saturday morning and there was still a 40 minute wait. 
,,,,,Bloody Mary and mimosas were great too!
,,,,,This restaurant has great food but it is a long wait. We came around 7pm to put our name down and had to wait about 2.5 hours for a table. It isn't so bad since they text you can there's a bar across the street that you can hang out at until a table is available. The food and drinks here are great! I had the fries with garlic aioli and mornay sauce. They were great but halfway through the meal the salt gets a little overwhelming so I would recommend splitting them but I don't eat meat so they were pretty much my only option on the menu. My brother had the fried chicken and said that it was the best he had ever had so that is saying something!
,,,,,"This was my second time visiting Au Cheval and it was better than I remembered. I came before 10am to skip the wait and be seated right as they opened. The beer selection here is better than any other burger joints in Chicago, but it was early so I ordered the house coffee. "
,,,,,"Our group of three shared a Triple Burger with a fried egg, two sides of thick cut bacon, Hash with Duck Heart Gravy, and the Crispy Fries. Everything came out in under ten minutes. Gorgeous presentation! Eggs were fried to perfection. Burger was well seasoned and juicy. The duck heart gravy were different and delicious, definitely worth getting over the crispy fries. Sauces that came with crispy fries were delicious, but fries could have been crisper. "
,,,,,"Bacon is the star of the show here. Hopefully they don't run out on your next visit. This stuff is crispy, thick, fatty, tender with a slight sweetness that balances out the overall flavor. So good!"
,,,,,The burgers are to die for and the cocktails are very creative! Love this place! Great staff!
,,,,,"This is my all time favorite burger place. Can it even be called a burger? It's so much better than a burger, it's too divine. I always order the crispy fries w/egg, single cheese burger with egg and pork belly, sometimes the honey-fried chicken, and their root beer. I've actually tried the chopped chicken liver as well, this was a nostalgic dish for a friend and she loved it, personally I'm not a liver fan myself. While living in the area I brought everyone who came to visit to this location. Yes, there's a SUPER long wait and parking is problematic but it's worth it. They will hand you a 4 hour wait time and shockingly almost every single time my text message comes in saying my table is ready around an hour forty minutes. Service is always wonderful."
,,,,,"My wife and I visited Au Cheval just after noon last Friday. There was an hour-long wait so we put our names on the list and headed to a bar just down the street. The restaurant texted us once a table was available. On our way in we overheard that the wait time had grown to over two hours. I ordered the Single Cheeseburger with Egg and Bacon. This was a beautiful burger. A nicely soft bun housed a juicy ground beef patty, melty cheddar cheese, creamy dijonaise, a yolky fried egg and delicious tender meaty thick cut bacon. The bacon is extra but is the best part of the burger and worth it! I also had a side of French Fries which were soft with a crisp outside, nicely salty and paired with a creamy sweet and lightly spicy mayo-based dip. The restaurant also features a nice selection of local craft beers on tap. Au Cheval is definitely worth a try for burger lovers."
,,,,,"I can't go to Chicago without stopping by Au Cheval. Their burgers are honestly worth the wait! I've been here twice now (I don't live in Chicago) and both times I was blown away. There's just the right amount of cheese and their sauce with diced onion and pickles gives it a tangy kick. Even my parents, who are hard to impress, said the burger was delicious. Some people enjoy it with thick cut bacon and/or a fried egg, but I like it just as well plain. We also had the Bloody Mary which came with a plethora of pickled veggies on top and had yummy seasoned salt around the rim. I recommend going in early and plan on walking around or doing other errands while you wait for your table. They text you when it's ready so you don't have to wait out in front of the restaurant. I will definitely be returning!"
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"I was recommended this place time and time again--and I simply waited to go because of the really long wait this place *always* had (always fluctuating between 1-3 hours). However, I finally gave it a try. Here's my thoughts:"
,,,,,"1) The food was phenomenal! The fries were a little cold, but they're fries and not easy to keep fully warm. The aioli with the fries was better than ketchup for sure."
,,,,,"I also had a Bloody Mary, which was strong and delicious, albeit a tad overpriced in my opinion."
,,,,,"2) Wait time aside, the service could've been better. My order was messed up not once, but twice. And I waited nearly 15 mins each time for them to bring back the correct menu item. They did not offer to remedy the situation, which bothered me a lot since we had not only waited so long but also paid a lot."
,,,,,"3) For a burger, fries, and a drink for one, I walked out paying $52. That didn't sit too well with me, but it was good food all around."
,,,,,Extra long wait (1.5 hrs) + Service Failures + Hefty Prices + Great Food = A place I would recommend a lot to others but not frequent personally.
,,,,,"The hype for this restaurant is absolutely deserved. Best burger ever, hands down. The thick cut bacon is incredible, and don't skimp on the egg either. Definitely worth the long wait."
,,,,,The bone marrow was also incredible as well if you're into it.
,,,,,"I can't say it's the best burger I've had but it is a great classic burger worth trying to see what he fuss is about - 2 patties, American? Cheese, and a relish. I wouldn't say it's the ""best"" because there's nothing that stood out to me from some of the other burgers I've had, especially coming from TX where burgers are amazing - I feel like I've had some just as good as this one! It's definitely worth going to try for me and I'm very glad I did. Would I go back? Hmm. Idk, not if there's a long wait lol."
,,,,,Something that did stand out to me was the service was great. Joshua and Nick are so welcoming and friendly. 
,,,,,I went on a Tuesday at 4 pm and there was NO wait for 2. It didn't start to pick up until 5:30 pm.
,,,,,"I know I said it isn't the best I've ever had but definitely a 5 star restaurant because the music was good, service was great, and finally trying this place was a cool experience."
,,,,,"Tried coming on a Friday night but it was a 5-hour wait, so I decided to come first thing it opened the next day. 0 wait time."
,,,,,"I don't think this would've been the best burger in the world if I had to wait 5 hours for it, but it was one of the best burgers I've had--holy sh*t. I added an egg to mine and got a side of fries and hashbrowns (hashbrowns were disappointing to me--maybe because I'm from the south and expect them to be a certain way). It was a great start to the day."
,,,,,"Don't sleep on the pickleback shots. I almost got a second but remembered it was like 10am in the morning still. It's a perfect pairing to your burger. So order five pickleback shots, a burger, and fries. You're welcome."
,,,,,The water was alright. Preferred the pickleback shot 1000%.
,,,,,"If six stars was option, heck even ten, we'd give it. Au Cheval simply has the best food and experience you can find in Chicago."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Not many restaurants can get us up, ready, and standing in line awaiting their opening time like Au Cheval."
,,,,,"As soon as you walk in, you are invited into an environment of culinary passion. The chefs are up front preparing their mise en place with fresh chives being sliced,french fries being prepared, and more. It's dimly lit but cozy, the kind of place you don't want to leave."
,,,,,The burgers are simply amazing--especially when the perfectly cooked egg and thick-cut bacon is nestled on top. We are obsessed with the hash browns (put an egg on it!) and the fries served with aioli.
,,,,,"ALL of our trips to Chicago include a trip to Au Cheval, it's a must."
,,,,,HELLO CHICAGO. 
,,,,,Back in Chicago so we had to go back to Au Cheval.
,,,,,Au Cheval Burger with bacon and their Crispy Duck Heart Gravy Hashbrowns. The best!
,,,,,Ridiculous.
,,,,,3.5 hour wait to get in because 
,,,,,It's an incredibly small restaurant.
,,,,,Open kitchen that has capacity for about 
,,,,,20 burgers every 10 minutes.
,,,,,Hype.
,,,,,Better burgers elsewhere.
,,,,,Don't get caught up in the hype.
,,,,,"2 hr wait for one of the best rated burgers in the country? What you get is quality ingredients and a bougie environment, not a delicious tasting burger. "
,,,,,"For me, the perfect burger has balance in textures and flavors. This single stack burger + bacon had a overwhelming meaty flavor. Despite the pickles and diced onion, there was no freshness or crunch felt with each bite. I found myself squirting ketchup on every bite to balance the flavors out and chomping on the side of pickle they provided. Adding a nice slab of tomato or lettuce might have done it some good. Adding a more umami sauce could've topped it off. Unfortunately, it did not make my top 10. "
,,,,,"Fortunately, the bone marrow and beef cheek marmalade was tasty. There was a good portion of marrow in each slab of bone, and the marmalade worked well with the marrow to balance out the fat. It was almost too sweet... ALMOST."
,,,,,"The hype is true!  I've searched far and wide for the world's best burger, and this is a very clear contender. Dare I say it's even better than the one that comes out of my own kitchen (first time I've ever said that about a burger)!"
,,,,,Show up and two hour wait at 6pm on a Tuesday night for 3 people.   I decided to wait.  You put your name on the list and then through Yelp you can see how many parties are in front of you.   So we went down the street to a bar and drank until it got to like 3 parties in front of us.  
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"I think the hype kinda of disappoint the expectation.  I heard about this place from my friend who's from the area. I found out later that I should the bun to the gluten free one (I think, I might be wrong) to make it more delicious. Don't get me wrong and not come here, it's still worth a visit and the food is all delicious. Plus, the vibe and music atmosphere have a good ambience and very chill. Is it the best burger in town? It's definitely up there but not yet on the top! Work on it Au Cheval :p! So we can have even more delicious food. I would also recommend that they have variety of food options to cater to more customers. The cocktails looks good but I didn't try as it's lunch (although it's 4 o'clock somewhere)."
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. You know this place is legit when their menu is pretty limited, yet so many people rave about the same limited items they do offer."
,,,,,"The wait was about 1.5 hours so we went next door (per their recommendation) to hang out and have some pre dinner drinks which made time pass fairly quickly. They have 2 burger options, single or double. Single consists of 2 patties and double has 3 patties. You can add thick bacon or egg to the burger (or both). The burger just melted in your mouth with juicy goodness. I typically would only be able to finish half a burger this size, but I ate nearly the whole damn thing."
,,,,,"We also ordered the fries to share and it was pretty good, but it's not really needed when you have a burger that damn good."
,,,,,"They were also sweet enough to give us dessert on the house, which completely surprised us."
,,,,,Their burgers are definitely worth the hype!
,,,,,Another great place in Chicago! We came around 12am and it was packed! We had to split our party of 4 since they didn't have seating together. The place is quite small and cramped with half of the space being a bar and just minimal seating all around. It was also very dark and loud. 
,,,,,I love the burger here though! It was so juicy and filling! My bf and I got the double cheeseburger and added the egg and the bacon to share. The bacon was a thick slice of pork belly...not the typical thinly sliced bacon. 
,,,,,"The burger was huge! There were parts of the burger that was salty but other than that, the burger was really good! The burger was fully cooked and the bacon added all the extra oil and fat to it to make it very savory. The egg was just a bonus on top! I also ordered a mojito drink which was just regular. "
,,,,,The whole meal came to about $30 for the burger and the drink. My bf and I shared the whole meal and it was very filling.
,,,,,"A moment of silence for how incredible the burger at Au Cheval is! Prior to my Chicago trip, I kept hearing about how delicious the burger here was, and how people would wait more than 3 hours for it. I wanted to see for myself if the burger here was truly worth the hype, and it 100000% is!!!"
,,,,,"The wait is absolutely crazy here, probably the longest wait I've ever seen  and I'm from LA lol. Since they open at 10am, I got here at 9:50 and was seated immediately. The restaurant was full by 10:15am!! By the time I left around 11am, the wait was 90 minutes. I've been here for dinner too, and the wait was about 3 hours. The good thing is that they use the No Wait app here, so once you check in with the host and give them your phone number, you can wander around the Fulton Market area and get a drink at any of the cool bars in the area."
,,,,,"The Single Cheeseburger with Bacon was glorious. The bacon is so thick and caramelized so it's sweet and perfectly complements the savoriness of the burger. A single burger actually has 2 super juicy patties, so it's pretty filling. The burger also has a light onion mix and a delicious sauce. Yes the burger is greasy and heavy, and will definitely put you into a food coma afterwards, but it's so so so worth it! Such an umami flavor explosion in my mouth ugh I would eat this burger everyday if I could. I've taken friends here and they all agree that this is the best burger they've ever had!"
,,,,,"I've also gotten the burger with the egg here, but I preferred it without the egg. Since the egg is over easy, it just drips everywhere and makes the burger really hard to eat. I've also sampled the fries here, but they're not really special. Just stick to the burger with bacon!"
,,,,,Single burger is 2 patties and 1/2 lb 
,,,,,Double is 3 patties and 3/4 lb 
,,,,,I added bacon and egg.   Bacon was great.  Egg was great.  The burger was really good but I wouldn't describe it as awesome or life changing or even something that I must have when I visit Chicago.  I felt my burger was overcooked a little honestly for this quality of a burger.   Fries were decent.   
,,,,,Place as a whole is cool with a good vibe and playing good music.

,,,,,Place as a whole is cool with a good vibe and playing good music.
,,,,,Au Cheval is officially my #1 fave restaurant in Chicago!! Definitely my first stop in future visits. Au Cheval has basically ruined all the future non-Au Cheval burgers I eat.... 
,,,,,TIP: Go during off hours so you only need to wait 30 ish minutes.  Come in small parties because most of the tables only seat up to 4.
,,,,,Just flat out delicious! I was not expecting a burger to be so delicious! The bacon on the burger was just flat out phenomenal and the egg just complimented the entire sandwich. The general Jane chicken was delicious. A must try!
,,,,,"Do not buy into the hype. I repeat: do not buy into the hype. Au Cheval serves up better than average burgers, but by no means is it worth it to wait even remotely close to three hours, which is the time our group of 7 was quoted. We tried again the next day and got in after 1.5 hours, but even then it was too long of a wait. Honestly, I'd wait for 1 hour; anything more than 1 hour is not worth the wait (unless you have time to kill)."
,,,,,"So I'll start by saying that the burger certainly looks and feels more gourmet than your average burger. It's got weight to it, it glistens, and it's cooked medium rare (but closer to medium). The burger is big, juicy, and very savory and rich. But then you take a few more bites, have some of the nicely crispy fries, and you notice that some bites are saltier than others. Then, as the meal progresses further, you it dawns on you that everything is way too salty. The burger, the fries, the hash browns -- everything except the pickle. You ultimately sit there wondering why you waited so long just to overindulge on sodium."
,,,,,"Perhaps I'm missing something but even the best burger is just a burger. Did it taste good? Yes (at least initially). Were the prices reasonable? Yes. Am I asking too many rhetorical questions? Yes, probably. But I wouldn't come back unless the wait was under an hour... and even then, maybe not."
,,,,,5 stars for food. 
,,,,,4 stars for service/wait. 
,,,,,"If you're visiting Chicago, I would highly recommend stopping by at Au Cheval located in the West Loop. Their burgers are probably the best in the city even though the average wait time there is 2.5 hours even on weeknights. I would recommend coming in to put your name down 2 hours prior to your desired eating time. There's a few bars nearby that you can go to while you wait. If you're coming here, you obviously have to try the burger. I get the single cheeseburger and add the egg and add the bacon. Come hungry, leave satisfied!"
,,,,,This review has been years in the making.  I've been going back and forth from Chicago to Charlotte for work/family for years and I've always been meaning to go here.
,,,,,"Now that I have a new job, I can actually go to Chicago and just visit family.  Made a stop into Au Cheval... the next available table was 3 hrs, so we went across the street to have a couple cocktails before getting our table.  Was it worth the wait?  I think so."
,,,,,"I love the inside of the restaurant.  It's very cozy and your run into people, but I don't think the restaurant has changed/renovated in a while.  Tons of character."
,,,,,"The servers were friendly (even though they were busy)  I don't know when you would even get a break if you worked here.  We got lucky and got the first booth, so it was good people watching and also witnessing the ebbs and flows of the restaurant itself."
,,,,,"The lighting inside is rather dim, so I'm sure the food photos don't do the food any justice (only because of the lighting!)."
,,,,,I would like to come back... but maybe i'll follow some of the other pro-tippers and skirt the wait and try Small Cheval first.
,,,,,"We waited 2.5 hours to eat here and let me tell you it was worth the wait. We put our name down & walked around, went to another bar for some drinks & came back when it was our turn. The good thing is once you put your name down you can check on your phone what place you are in line. "
,,,,,I got the single cheese burger with egg & bacon & also the fries. The single burger comes with two patties. 
,,,,,The fries- there is something about the fries that are so addicting and so good. I don't know how to explain it you just have to try it for yourself. 
,,,,,The burger- the meat is so juicy & soft and even the buns are amazing. The bacon is actually sweet AND salty and goes very well with the burger. But I think next time I'd want to try it without the bacon. I got my egg fully cooked because I don't like runny egg but the runny egg also looked amazing. 
,,,,,Would definitely wait again.
,,,,,"Never a disappointment. There are just as good, if not better, burgers around town - yes. "
,,,,,Depends on the what kind of burger mood you're in !! Au cheval has always been good to me.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"The wait times for here are pretty insane. My friend put his name in for a party of 5 around 2:30 PM and we got our table at 6:30. Fortunately for us, we went to bars nearby and had some fun throwing ice at a bell at Federales. I got the double cheeseburger with an egg and it was absolutely delicious. Something so simple but amazingly done."
,,,,,"I was really ready to wait at least an hour in line to try their famous burger, but lo and behold, we were seated right away (random Tuesday at the end of October around 11am). The place is quite small, so I can imagine why there would be a wait if they were slammed. One thing to note is their regular cheeseburger comes with two patties and their double cheeseburger comes with three patties (don't ask me why). So, keep that in mind when you are ordering. We ordered a double cheeseburger with all the fixings and split it three ways, so we basically got a burger patty each. It was good - really, really good. That thick cut bacon is next level and the egg was a good touch - definitely add both!"
,,,,,"Touted as the place for the ""Best Burger"" in America with wait times going to up to 2-3 hours during peak times, the hype for this place is through the roof. My visit this time only took a 35 mins wait as we went in at around 3:30PM on a Friday."
,,,,,The interior of Au Cheval is dim with an old school dark pub bar type of feel. There's a small candle light set on each table which helps to illuminate the place. One cool part of the interior is the ability to see the cooks make some of the dishes if you sit at the bar area. (boy is there a lot of salt sprinkled on the eggs)
,,,,,"General Jane's Fried Chicken - The chicken came coated with a light sticky sauce with slight spice and sweetness that wasn't too overwhelming. Once you bite through the outer crust, I noticed that the interior wasn't as flavorful as I would expect. Would recommend dipping the meat inside with the rest of the sauce for that flavor. Score of 3.75/5"
,,,,,Hash with Duck Heart Gravy - Looking for something rich and satisfying? Well this dish speaks volumes and the gravy haromizes well with the crispy potato hash. Score of 5/5
,,,,,"Crispy Fries with Mornay Sauce, Garlic Aioli - The Mornay sauce is the highlight with this appetizer having a creamy texture, with the garlic Aioli being the sauce with a slightly stronger taste. Good dish to have if you have a party of four and just want to dig into some chow. Score of 4/5"
,,,,,"Foie Gras, Scrambled Eggs & Toast - Starting to see a theme with the dishes, comes another rich and heavy dish with the foie Gras. Definitely one of the signature dishes which comes with sadly only roughly 4 pieces of foie Gras that melts in your mouth. The caramelized onions complement the dish well with its sweetness and goes well with the crispy French toast. Score of 5/5"
,,,,,"You might have noticed this review is missing out on the most important item on the menu, ""The Best Burger"" "
,,,,,"This is because I'm only including items I ate on this trip. Having been to Au Cheval 8 times, I can honestly say I'm not impressed by the burger. It's good don't get me wrong, but it certainly is not worth the hype nor the wait. I'll update this review once I have another go at the burger, but having tried it three times, it has always left me feeling unsatisfied. "
,,,,,What I do love however is the thick cut peppered bacon. Now that's a dish I would say earns a reputation as one of the best!
,,,,,"Au Cheval comes packed with dishes that out perform their burger reputation, has great friendly service staff and a cool interior design. The wait can be long but with their system, you could always go for a nice stroll around while waiting to get called back in."
,,,,,Docking a star here cause of the usual long waiting times but overall great dishes (minus the burger)
,,,,,Overall: came into this restaurant with the mentality that a burger can only be so good. Au Cheval proved me wrong. 
,,,,,"Got the single cheeseburger with bacon and egg, and got a half order of the bone marrow (a full order was too much and so they were willing to accommodate and only charged us for a half order! Great service). The first bite of this burger is nothing short of an instant nut - just meaty goodness complimented by great bacon, egg, cheese, and fluffy and toasted bread. I see some reviews saying it's slightly salty, and while I agree, I'm honestly just nitpicking at this point. What a burger. Thank god I don't live nearby or I'd straight up be obese."
,,,,,"For the bone marrow, the highlight of it honestly wasn't the bone marrow, but the beef cheek marmalade that is such a unique taste. You get this meaty beefy fat flavor coupled with a hint of sweetness in this beautiful dark and rich jam-like liquid, and putting it on their buttery French toast is incredible. My girlfriend went to the bathroom and I stole her slice type of good. She hates me now but I could care less - I got the extra slice."
,,,,,"tl;dr: great food, great service. Slightly salty, but nothing to complain about for sure. Four stars because the highlight of the bone marrow isn't the bone marrow, but instead is the beef jam, but such a treat!"
,,,,,"I didn't want to believe it.  I didn't want to believe that this would be the best burger I ever have and no other burger would live up to it.  But I was defeated.  Au Cheval. Is. The. Best. Burger.  I've tried others in the city that are similar (Maudes, Loyalist, Small Cheval) but the bacon, egg, and sauce, truly makes this burger.  I love Au Cheval because they have a limited menu (theres only one burger, you can alter a few ways by adding egg, bacon, another patty, etc), a solid craft beer menu, and awesome service.  "
,,,,,"Minus 1 star for the wait - Yes the wait is terrible.  When I come with guests I always try to reserve a table before 5 on a week day (the spend the wait time exploring the many happy hour options near by).  On a Tuesday I've waited 40 minutes at 6pm, and on a weekend I've been told not to bother putting my name on the list because it'll be past midnight.  That part sucks.  Is au cheval ""worth the wait""? it depends.  Nothing is worth 4+ hours.  However the burger is the best you'll ever have! No doubt about it.  "
,,,,,"Also try the fries, bacon side(appetizer), and bone marrow -- yum!"
,,,,,I've heard people say this is the best burger but I didn't believe it til I actually experienced it. 
,,,,,"I had tried the burger at Small Cheval and wasn't that impressed. Plus, knowing that these were sister restaurants, I thought the burger was going to taste the same. Boy, was I wrong. "
,,,,,"One evening, we were hungry and decided we were going to Au Cheval, no matter the wait time. We were quoted a wait of 90 mins for a table. They took my phone # and said they would text me once my table was ready and they would hold the table for 10 minutes. Fine. Challenge accepted. We went down the street for drinks and about an hour later, we got the text. We quickly closed our tab and headed over."
,,,,,"We ordered the ""single"" cheeseburger w bacon. The single actually has 2 patties and the ""double"" has 4 patties. The patties were juicy and flavorful and the bacon was thick and sweet. We ordered fries to share and they were crunchy, just the way I like 'em!  The aioli mayo that came as a dip with 'em took the fries up another notch. "
,,,,,Definitely the best burger I've had so far. 
,,,,,Already planning a return trip back.
,,,,,"I kept seeing this place on lists as one of the best burgers ever. So I tried it and I was impressed! It's good stuff. Although, it's very filling and greasy so it's good comfort food. You want to make sure you can go home and nap after or go exercise after. Whichever you prefer. haha"
,,,,,"I loved that if you order a single cheeseburger, they give you two patties. If you order a double cheeseburger, then they give you 3 patties. Pleasant surprise! My friend is gluten free so they just gave her two hash browns instead of bread. So she got a 3 patty cheeseburger with two big hash browns as bread. It was glorious."
,,,,,"The fries were not my favorite. The fat that they are cooked in taste like the fryer in a fast food restaurant after a day of using the oil. I totally think that the kind of fat they used is the fad now. The mashed potatoes were great, though! I just wish I got a bigger portion of that. "
,,,,,It's definitely worth the wait! Especially since people go to nearby bars and drink sometimes they don't show up. That's how my friends and I got in.
,,,,,"Stop! You've found it. The BEST burger on the planet!!! That's why you're reading Yelp reviews, correct? The cheeseburger á cheval is simply perfect. Please do yourself a favor and get it with both bacon and an egg. Also, if you're the ""well done"" type, fight the urge to ask for it as such and just have it as it comes. The juiciness of this masterpiece is unparalleled. The thick bacon that is borderline pork belly is sweet, sticky, finished off under the salamander for caramelized bits, and topped with coarse black pepper. The dijonnaise, finely chopped onions, and thinly sliced homemade pickles are perfect for this symphony of a burger. "
,,,,,Tidbit: a single has two patties and the double has three. 
,,,,,"I also really enjoyed what I always order if it's on the menu, chilaquiles!! And they are AMAZING! "
,,,,,Long wait? It's worth it! Go next door and have some drinks while waiting.
,,,,,"Is this what is being paraded as a 'single' burger these days? Does the double come with a forklift, or is that extra? Yes, the menu does in fact feature a variety of items, but one look around the dining room and you instantly know what dining here is all about...THE cheeseburger. "
,,,,,"Au Cheval can be found on many a ""top"" and ""best"" lists for the critically acclaimed burger. In my previous experience visiting places with this sort of pedigree, disappointment soon follows. I mean 5k+ raving Yelp reviews? It can't really be that good. Actually, yes it can. "
,,,,,"The Single Cheeseburger with Bacon was is all that and bag of chips. The extra thick cut bacon is caramelized, adding a sweet component that perfectly complements the savory burger. Oh and that single? It's really a double patty....pretty sure no ones gonna be mad at that. I'm not usually a fan runny egg on my burgers, but it works here. Do expect a whole lot of mess though! "
,,,,,"I'm really trying to find a reason to say this isn't the best burger I've ever had, but my hate would be unsubstantiated. I tap in submission....Au Cheval is king."
,,,,,"Interior - Dark, cozy, diner set-up but with a bar, hipster. "
,,,,,Service - Excellent. 
,,,,,Wait time - None at 10:30AM on Wednesday. 
,,,,,"Single burger - Comes with two patties and a slice of cheese. Patties were oily, salty, and delicious. Buns were buttered up. "
,,,,,Foie gras and scrambled eggs - Way too rich. It felt like eating blocks of oil. 
,,,,,"Crispy Fries, Garlic Aioli & Fried Farm Egg - Crispy, basic fries."
,,,,,"Side of bacon - Thick, juicy, salty. I preferred the bacon from Sweet Maple in SF."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This spot was so packed when we visited Chicago and now I know why. Super awesome food, ambiance, and decor. I felt like I was in a classy pub in Europe! "
,,,,,Their cheese burger with egg and bacon was a popular dish to try and you have to get the fries! 
,,,,,We went for my friend's birthday and they brought her a huge cannoli with a sparkler on it that she adored! Super friendly service and a must try when you're in town!
,,,,,"Oh Au Cheval, I had been waiting for one of your burgers for such a long time. I recently gave up red meat, but I had to throw my diet to the side for one day of indulgence!"
,,,,,"What I ordered: the burger of course! (Note: a single here has 2 patties and the double has 3.) I got the egg and bacon on top as well. It was absolutely heavenly. The bacon was unlike any bacon I had tasted before. It was so thick and meaty. To drink I had a Bloody Mary. It was strong and not too spicy, but still had flavor. "
,,,,,"Honestly, I don't know if this is the best burger in Chicago because I haven't been to the other ""best burger"" places, but this burger has to be pretty darn close to the best!"
,,,,,"I will say the line is almost always long here so make sure to leave early so you can put your name in, then take a nice walk around the block or find someplace to get drinkies!"
,,,,,"""Oh. My. God."" "
,,,,,"We ordered the cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon and the house made bologna sandwich. As a side we ordered the crispy fries. AMAZING. the burger was juicy and the sauce was delicious! So many other things we wanted to try, but the portions were healthy. "
,,,,,The wait was about 35 minutes on a Saturday for lunch. Not terrible considering how popular this place is. 
,,,,,Our rating: 9.2/10
,,,,,5/5 yelp stars 
,,,,,Would we return? In a heartbeat!
,,,,,"Sad to say that my first time at Au Cheval did not exceed my expectations. The burger is good, but not the best burger I've ever had. The bacon was thick and the egg was perfectly cooked. However, the meat was a little too salty. Don't wait more than one hour in line as there are many amazing burger joints in town!"
,,,,,"Obviously very little needs to be said. This is the best burger I've ever put in my mouth. If you get this burger without the bacon you're just being stupid and yes, the bacon is worth the 5+ extra dollars it is. JUST DO IT. also, anyone who says small cheval is better or just as good had never eaten at au cheval. I've eaten at both and while they both have the most amazing French fries, the burger at au cheval is a completely different t burger. It's a religious experience. A MUST TRY."
,,,,,My friend hyped this place up and I'm glad she did. 
,,,,,The burger here is my favorite now. The thicc bacon with two c's cause they are thick AF like pork belly bacon. The bacon has sweetness glaze that works well with the burger. Make sure you top the burger off with eggs. The egg yolk busting all over the burger is straight food porn. It will get that burger perfect. 
,,,,,The service is nice and the server is super helpful. I would drive back up from Ohio for it again. 
,,,,,I would recommend it and say it's definitely worth it.
,,,,,"With triple patties accompanied by a phat pork belly cut resting on buttered brioche, there's plenty justification on why this double cheeseburger beauty won the nation's #1 burger award. Why do people wait hours for this upscale diner? Well, simply look..."
,,,,,"Small diner vibes. Quite a wait for any party past two members. If you're pursuing an adventure, I highly recommend solo seating and try to nab a quick bar seat. No, really. For your first time, enjoy that solitude burger and focus on the flavor. Take that first bite, smile to yourself in excitement, and feast away."
,,,,,I mean after 2 - 3 hours wait on empty stomach almost anything served up will taste great. 
,,,,,"Wasn't that impressed by the burger honestly - it was great, but was it worth the wait? If you want to cross off list of things/places to go in Chicago, then for sure wait in line for it. Go to a bar nearby or come in the dead winter on the coldest day and minimize the wait. "
,,,,,The egg do look really cool on top of the burger and hash. Good effect and very runny. It's called Au Cheval for good reason.
,,,,,"No, this is not the best burger in town however it is still a damn good burger. The fries are somewhat a lopsided side in my opinion because they're virtually flavorless. The two sauces weren't much of an aid along with an perfectly prepared egg. On this particular Labor Day my wait wasn't long but it's no secret that on most days your wait will be lengthy. I can't speak to any other menu items but I will say that at their satellite locations ""small cheval"" they don't prepare the burgers with eggs so essentially you're getting half the burger because I think it's makes a tremendous difference. The place can get loud & while my wait was short sitting at the bar was somewhat uncomfortable because of people constantly bumping into you. I'd love to come back to try some of their cocktails though."
,,,,,Yes I waited in line for 50 minutes ! 
,,,,,It was so worth the wait - this place renewed my faith in waiting for a restaurant! 
,,,,,"I ordered what the waiter suggested, burger  with bacon    & a side of fries ! "
,,,,,"First off, the bacon  alone was god like ( order a side  of bacon if you can ) this burger  is just .   Put your ego aside, wait in line & just smile as it's served !  Btw, my vodka lemonade was also very"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,No idea about interior or staff because we ordered carry-out.  Burger and fries were awesome sauce!  Will get them again next time we are nearby and very hungry... Burgers were pretty big :).   Fries were very good also.
,,,,,Great food and atmosphere.  Drinks top notch.  Highly recommend. The burger is great with plenty of nicely browned griddle on the edges and cooked perfectly medium in the center.
,,,,,This has probably been my favorite burger I have eaten. The first bite into the burger and juice just oozes out. The burger patty was well seasoned and cooked. The thick cut bacon added a lot more moisture and flavor on top of the burger. The fried egg on top was the finisher and biting that burger gave a feeling of a sucker punch coming straight for you. It was truly delightful. 
,,,,,The fois gras was very strong in flavor. Initially our dish was not deemed up to their standards so they remade it for us before sending it out. The dish had a good balance with the toast and eggs to balance the strong salty flavor of the fois gras. 
,,,,,Overall I simply enjoyed the meal and would love to come back. The only downside is that during dinner time our wait was 2.5 hours long.
,,,,,"I'm not sure what happened to this place. I went back during a lunch break. The burger was just bad. There was barely any onion/garlic aioli on it first off. The burger wasn't fresh. They mass cook the burgers usually fresh but we got one that wasn't part of that batch. And because we were sitting at the bar, we had direct access to see all the cooks make the burgers. In 2 instances, I kid you not, they left the plastic from the cheese on the burger and after placing it on the burgers, they removed it and still served it!!! WTF. I swear, I had taste of plastic in my mouth afterwards...."
,,,,,"I've been a backer of Au Cheval from the first moment I had it. But no joke, it was bad. It was so disappointing. Small Cheval has exceeded Au Cheval in burger ranking. It's just not worth it anymore after the experience I had. Go to Small Cheval."
,,,,,"I really cannot get enough of this place. Yes I will wait 2 hours for the burger. It's the best burger I had in the world. I lived in NYC and I paid $35 for a burger at the Minneta Tavern famous for their black label burger. This burger is 3 times less the cost and 3 times way better. It's a very simple burger but it's packed with so much flavor! I love the garlic aoli, the bun, just everything about is great. "
,,,,,"I've also had the Jane's fried chicken. It's really good too. Just be prepared to get your hands dirty. But to be perfectly honest, it's really hard to stay away from the burger. It's the best. I'm hyping it because you will not be disappointed."
,,,,,"It's my favorite restaurant in the city. If I have guests in town, I am definitely taking them there. The wait doesn't seem to bad. Put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready. There are plenty of bars around the area for you to have some drinks while you wait."
,,,,,My girlfriend and I are literally at work right now thinking about how much we want to come back here.
,,,,,"When we planned our weekend trip to Chicago, we didn't originally have this place on our itinerary; however, upon receiving multiple recommendations from friends on Facebook stating that this place has the best burgers, we knew we had to stop by."
,,,,,"I see a lot of reviews stating that the waits are too long here. I don't know if we got lucky or if we just chose a good time to go, but we came for brunch and only waited about five minutes. There were quite a few people waiting by the time we left so I would definitely recommend getting here as early as possible if eating here is a priority for you. Even if you do have to wait, they have a nice system in place where they text you once your table is ready so you can walk around and look at the shops nearby while you wait."
,,,,,"I really like the ambiance of this place. It's a nice combination of quaint and classy. If I was a local I could definitely imagine myself coming here with a small group of coworkers or for casual date nights. The only somewhat negative thing I have to say about the interior of the restaurant is that the restaurant isn't very big and seating is somewhat tight, so if you're someone who is claustrophobic, this might not be the best place for you to go. It didn't bother me, though. "
,,,,,"The service here was really good. I did not catch our waiter's name, but he was friendly and did a great job helping us modify our burgers to our liking and ensuring that our food was properly prepared. "
,,,,,"Now, most places you go to, you're going to look around and see people ordering a variety of food. Not here. When you look around at what other people are ordering here, you are going to see that more than 95% of the people eating here have a burger on their plate. There's a reason for that. The burgers here are simply spectacular. My girlfriend took just a couple of bites of her burger and stated to me, ""This is the best burger I've ever eaten."" The meat is cooked to a perfect medium rare and the flavors are just perfect. I ordered mine with bacon and the bacon was thick, flavorful, and delicious. One thing to note about the burgers here is that there are not a lot of options and variations. They just have one burger that you can make small additions and subtractions to. That's because Au Cheval understands that when you have something that's good, you don't need to alter it, and that's pretty spectacular."
,,,,,"We also ordered the crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried farm egg. The fries were nothing to write home about, but the mornay sauce it was served with was! Wow! The description I am about to give is not going to do it justice, but it was like a delicious cheese gravy. Going back and forth between eating my burger and dipping the fries into the mornay sauce was a delightful culinary experience. "
,,,,,"Au Cheval was definitely a highlight of our Chicago trip. I don't know the next time we will be in Chicago but when we do eventually return, we will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"When I was visiting Chicago for work, 10 out of 10 people suggested I had to visit Au Cheval. ""Last Meal on Earth"" they say. Knowing that there's a ridiculously long wait, I planned ahead. Dropped in at 4pm on a Tuesday and got seated immediately. Since I was a party of one, I sat on the end of the bar which IMO is the best seat in the house. Got a full view of chefs assemble the burgers in the open kitchen. "
,,,,,"I ordered the cheeseburger and topped it off with an egg and a thick slice of bacon. Oh my heavens! It was delicious! Hands down the best burger I've ever had! Everything was made to perfection. Even without the add ons, it probably would of been just as amazing. The fries on the other hand was a salt bomb and wished I saved  the stomach space to try the bone marrow instead. "
,,,,,Stop what you're doing now. You don't need another review to tell you it's just that good. Just eat it.
,,,,,I absolutely loved this place! I can definitely see why they are one of the top rated/reviewed places in Chicago. 
,,,,,I came in on a Saturday afternoon and immediately you can see that there was a wait. I came by myself so I didn't have to wait for a seat at the bar but that's really dependent on the time you arrive (I got lucky). 
,,,,,They have an open kitchen so you really get to see all the cooks work in unison as they prepare the food. If you come with a party of 2 or more you probably will wait around 30 minutes unless you don't mind sitting at the bar. 
,,,,,"When it came time to order some food, I went with a single cheese burger add foie gras and an egg. When the burger came I couldn't believe how simple it looked and my mouth was in for a real treat. That first bite was magical. The sudden burst of flavors and the juice dripping from the burger was a moment my tastebuds and eyes would forever cherish. I immediately thought to myself, ""this is hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten"" and I have eaten a lot of burgers in my lifetime. "
,,,,,"Now on to the service, the server was very polite and patient when I asked for recommendations. It was an honest opinion and it was a great one at that. My neighbor that was sitting next to me ordered a side of fries and when the bill came for them, the server said, ""since you didn't eat all your fries, we took it off your bill"". When I heard that I was in disbelief. Not only do they have the food quality down but their service was impeccable! I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back one day!"
,,,,,"So I'd heard all about how Au Cheval has the best burger in Chicago & America, and wow... totally true. We only had about a 10/15 minute wait on a Thursday night at 9:30ish, so not bad at all. Sitting at the bar was really cool because you get to see the cooks prepare everything. It's like watching a work of art be created. "
,,,,," My boyfriend and I both ordered the single cheeseburger (which is 2 burger patties btw), added the egg & bacon, and we split an order of the fries. The side of fries comes with garlic aioli which is amazing. The fries are super good, perfectly crisp, and just salted enough. Highly recommend. Now, the burger blew us both away. It was the best I've ever had. My boyfriend gets a burger almost everywhere we go and he loved it too. Our only complaint was we could only finish half the burger (totally tragic). It's a really huge burger when you add the bacon and all the other toppings. I'd recommend splitting the burger if you're getting any sides or don't have a huge appetite. "
,,,,,"All that being said, I'd love to come back to Au Cheval. Great atmosphere, really lively, and life-changing food."
,,,,,"We came here on a Saturday morning around 10:20AM, a little after it opened and there was already a waiting list. Luckily, they had a texting system to provide our place on the waiting list. We walked a block away to grab some coffee and within 20 minutes, we got a text for the table. "
,,,,,"The restaurant was cozy and we were happily seated on the couch in the back with a nice view of the kitchen. Both my partner and I ordered a single cheeseburger (comes with two patties) with a side order of the thick cut peppered bacon, in addition to an order of crispy fries with garlic aioli and fried egg. After much anticipation, the burgers came out freshly cooked and smelled amazing! However, after the first few bites, I was left unsatisfied. I could've done with a single patty and bacon without the cheese, to be honest. Two patties was too much for me. I also didn't taste the natural flavors of the beef patty--only tasted the over-saltiness of the bacon. "
,,,,,I have to say that I enjoy In-N-Out more than the burgers here.. and would've spent way less. 
,,,,,The fries were nicely crispy but both of the sauces were too sweet. It would've been nice to get one sweet and one salty/spicy. 
,,,,,"Service was wonderful! I heard the wings were good but they were only served during dinner. Overall, I think this place is a little overrated for the price, but a good option to check out if you love cheeseburgers. It's just not my cup of tea."
,,,,,First time here and all I can say is Must have. Must eat. You're welcome .

,,,,,1st time here and the hype didn't disappoint! We came here on a Monday for early dinner (5pm). The wait was only 30 min in oppose to 3 hrs like what everyone said. 
,,,,,The cheeseburger was amazing. It's one of the best we've had! We added the thick cut bacon & egg. The burger was super juicy and flavorful. The bacon is caramelized. We both ordered the single burger and it was so filling. Our waiter recommended that rather than the double burger (that would've been too big). 1 star off because the French Fries could've been better.  It wasn't crispy and a bit soft.

,,,,,"Table of 2 arrival at 11pm, quoted 15-30 mins but sat at 1155pm. Just so happen we decided to sit at the bar to wait & another host saw us then asked us to be seated at a table. The original host misheard and thought we were a table of 3, maybe this was the original cause of the hold up? "
,,,,,"Place is small, loud and definitely not good for big groups of 5+. We were hoping that arriving so late that it wouldn't be THAT long of a wait but oh well. "
,,,,,Fries came out first and AMAZED. MUST get. Extra crispy without the burnt. 
,,,,,"1st old fashion, okay..nothing special. "
,,,,,"2ns old fashion, mother of gawd, bartender definitely didn't want to make a 3rd. Like they forgot the alch in the first one and wanted to make it up on this one. "
,,,,,"I got the burger without the bacon but when I tried it, oh I ordered a whole side of it! Bacon, MUST. For those who don't eat pork, should make an exception..jk"
,,,,,Bacon....is also pork belly
,,,,,"Melts, in your mouth. Not even salty as you would think it would be. Drool"
,,,,,"Burger was cooked at medium which was great, egg came sunny side. The seasoning seemed a little salty for me but for some odd reason after every bite it was just getting better. "
,,,,,"Service, I was a little disappointed that we had to remind about a rootbeer float after we got our food. The misheard about the quantity of people. Throughout the time, it also seemed like we had a different waiter as well but place is small enough you can easily get their attention. "
,,,,,"Would've capped at a 4 star but the bacon, fries and old fashioned swept me off my feet and made me forget the rest. "
,,,,,Would I ever come back? Hell. Yes.
,,,,,"Checked in at 2pm on a Saturday and was told it'll be a 2-2.5 hour wait. I was told I would receive a text message from them and didn't receive anything after waiting 3 hours. Pretty annoyed with hunger and after asking the host, he only apologized, shrugged it off, and took me to a table. The whole place was packed because its space is extremely small. My friend and I ordered the General Jane's fried chicken wings for an appetizer and split the single cheeseburger and added an egg and bacon since I'm told this is the go-to. Luckily the service was fast with our food. All of the food was honestly really good and fairly worth saying I've been here, but I really doubt I'd ever really come back for another time and wait for that long. **Walking out of the restaurant, I overheard the hostess quoting a 5 hour wait at 5pm!"
,,,,,"THE BEST. This is what my wife and I look forward to coming to Chicago. Worth the 1-2 hour wait. Just give them your number and they'll text you when your up. You can also text to see your spot in line or cancel as needed. Must get the cheeseburger with bacon and egg. It will change your life. Do not hesitate to get the bone marrow. You will thank me later. They have brew and drinks to compliment your meal. We get an order of fries too. Great service, atmosphere and music! 80s baby here and this small establishment took me back to the golden days of music. I can't speak for everybody, but this definitely is one of the most memorable spots to eat from coast to coast. "
,,,,,-Always Chungry
,,,,,"Finally visited Au Cheval for my birthday with my wife and in-laws. One of the best burgers (if not the best) I've ever eaten. Delicious eating all around, to be honest. We went at 17:00 (5:00pm) which is early for us to eat, however, we were able to beat the rush with only a 20 minute wait to be seated. When we were leaving the wait was upwards of 2.5 to 3 hours and to be honest I would have waited this long to eat. "
,,,,,We started off with the roasted marrow bones with beef cheek marmalade which was a perfect mix of savory with a hint of sweet and very rich flavor. We also shared a crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy which was phenomenal as well. 
,,,,,"I ordered the double cheeseburger (note: single cheeseburger has 2 patties, double has 3) with the thick (note: very thick and delicious) bacon and over medium egg. "
,,,,,I highly suggest Au Cheval regardless of the wait and will be back as soon as I can!
,,,,,This was my third time trying Au Cheval. I have always heard about the burgers and the long lines so I thought I should give it a try. 
,,,,,"The first time I came here, I got just the double burger (no egg or bacon) and a side of fries with the garlic aioli. The double burger actually came with three patties (and the single comes with  one). To be honest, the patties were extremely salty and I was not impressed. However, I thought that the fries and garlIc aioli were good and better than the burger. I definitely do not think that Au Cheval could have one of the best burgers in the nation. "
,,,,,"The second time I went, I got the burger again but with an egg. Again, I thought the burger was extremely salt but the egg yolk definitely made it  more bearable. "
,,,,,"The third time I went, I got the burger and two appetizers: the bone marrow and fried chicken. I thought that the bone marrow was delicious and the portion size was sizable. It came with four half bones and four half buttered toasts. Although the butter on the toast and the fat from the bone marrow were overwhelming, it was overall a good experience. The fried chicken was a Korean style fried chicken with a glaze as the sauce. It came with 6 pieces: 3 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 1 wing. I thought that the ginger taste was a bit strong, but those that were at my table thought that it was good. I will say that the meat was extremely juicy and moist on the inside, which made the experience a lot more enjoyable. "
,,,,,"The service here is always great, but the inside very small and noisy. If you are looking for a quiet place to chat with friends, this is not the place. I definitely think this place is worth trying but it was not one that wow'd me for the kind of reputation it holds."
,,,,,"Burgers as good as they come. Less is more, not too many options for the burger but the ones they have (thick cut pork belly/bacon and egg) are perfectly executed. The uber thick house pepper bacon topper is moist, practically melts in your mouth and delivers the burgers Umami wow factor.  "
,,,,,Can be a long wait to get in.
,,,,,"Stopped in for lunch while in chicago for a wedding.  We knew about the notorious wait so arrived early on a Saturday (about 10:40am) to put our names in.  We were told it was a 45min wait (not bad!) so went to explore a bit in the neighborhood. While the area is super cute unfortunately a lot of things around don't open until 11am, but we managed.  When the table was ready we were seated right away.  We got the burger, fried balogna, bacon and a side of fries.  The food was good as expected but I can;t stress enough DON'T skip the bacon it was definitely my favorite part. "
,,,,,"Service was good, they didn't rush us at all which is nice but also maybe why the wait is so long..."
,,,,,PRICING
,,,,,"It's definitely a bit pricier than the average burger from a higher end burger restaurant, but by a large margin - I'd say it's about $4 higher than average compared to other places I've eaten at. The side dishes are definitely something to be wary of since things can add up very quickly since the burger does not come with one."
,,,,,QUALITY
,,,,,"My friends and I came here due to the reputation of this restaurant having the best burger in Chicago. It definitely was a delicious burger, but it's also very heavily salted - their seasoning and spices give the burger a rich aroma, but it overpowers the beef flavor. That being said, the burger is cooked to an appropriate temperature, and the add-ons (like egg, bacon, etc) definitely give a solid boost of flavor to the dish. The fries are delicious, but few relative to the pricing - the dipping sauces however are excellent."
,,,,,SERVICE
,,,,,"Very nice and friendly, especially to people who have never been. Be wary, due to the restaurant's reputation, there is a significant wait time. My friends and I waited about 2 hours and enjoyed ourselves at the bar across the street in the meantime - there's definitely other things to do in the area as long as you don't spoil your appetite."
,,,,,OVERALL
,,,,,"The burger was very hyped, but it's not something you would go for frequently. The wait times are much longer than other popular places I've been to, and it can definitely put a decent dent in your wallet considering you're buying a burger and fries (and possibly a drink). However, I still recommend people give this place a try if they haven't already done so."
,,,,,"We love hitting Au Cheval on every visit to Chicago with out of town family!  Their burger (single, which is really a double) is our son's favorite meal in the city!  We all splurged this last time and added the foie gras, which was absolutely fabulous!  "
,,,,,"We shared fries and the hash browns for the table and they were just as good!  The fries hot and crispy plus the hash browns were gone in a flash!  Hot, cheesy, and destined to become a new favorite for our family!"
,,,,,"We added some local draft beers (all paired great with the burgers), our grandsons went with the fabulous root beer floats, and some opted for cocktails, which the bartender agreed to personalize for two of our party and did them perfectly!"
,,,,,Fun atmosphere and a great Chicago foodie stop!  Don't miss it!  We went early and only had a short wait!
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Best burger is Chicago! I've tried multiple times to get in for dinner and the wait is was around 4 hrs every time. We decided to hit Au Cheval on a regular work day for lunch and I was not disappointed! I would def wait the 4 hrs for dinner.
,,,,,"I'm not sure if Au Cheval truly has the best burger in the country, but it sure is crazy good. The patties were perfectly seasoned with a pretty generous amount of pepper that I'm not used to in most burgers. Every bite was juicy without being a greasy mess that drips down your hands and forearms. For about $2 extra, you can add a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg which I thought was a good addition but not enough to take the burger to the next level. You can also add two pieces of bacon for about $5 extra, which I definitely recommend. They were thick cut so you won't get that crispy crunch but you'll get all that extra flavor that made the burger even better. The patties are on the smaller side so a single cheeseburger will come with two and they can only be cooked medium or well done. I would have preferred a thicker patty so that I could get it medium rare. "
,,,,,Service was excellent and I liked the open kitchen. Seating is pretty limited so get there early if you can. I got seated right away on a Tuesday about 10:45am but the place was packed out half an hour later.
,,,,,"Thank my friend for helping me put ourselves on the waitlist after work. For 2 of us, we were quoted about an hour wait on monday 6:30pm, and by the time I got there from ORD airport, we were immediately seated. We shared the double cheeseburger with egg and bacon, along with egg fries with Mornay sauce and garlic aioli and kale Caesar salad. The burger is above average but a bit salty. The bacon is of the consistency of Millionaire's Bacon often found in brunches in the Bay Area. On the pricier side, the quality somewhat matches the price. The fries is likely similar to a side of fries, but you also get the egg and additional dipping sauces. I really enjoyed the garlic aioli sauce. The kale Caesar salad is the saltiest dish of all we ordered, so skip that and find a salad elsewhere for that. It wasn't worth the wait and I feel that this place is definitely overhyped."
,,,,,MUST ORDER THE BONE MARROW. 3 gigantic bone marrow pieces for $18 is such a steal! I loved the toast and beef cheek marmalade it came with. One of the most delicious bone marrow dishes I've had! 
,,,,,I also got the burger with millionaires bacon and eggs. The burger was delicious and would def order again! I came on Friday at 10:20 and grabbed the last 2 counter seats!
,,,,,"The best burger and bologna sandwich I ever had! I have waited forever to get to Au Cheval. The wait is always super long to get a table. I finally ordered a pickup order- thanks to COVID-19, it was so worth it. I can't wait until the restrictions are lifted so I can eat there. Downing that amazing burger and the bologna sandwich in the car because you can't wait to get home isn't good enough! Do NOT hate on the bologna! It's not the pitiful sandwich you had at a cafeteria!"
,,,,,"Delicious and lives up to the hype. The fries and sauce were  amazing. The bacon was THICC and crispy. The wait wasn't long Sunday morning, thankfully."
,,,,,"Why 5 stars? Because I don't know if it was the best burger I've ever had, but it was definitely 5-stars."
,,,,,   ---   ---   ---
,,,,,"The thing is, when something is hyped up to possibly be the best burger in the country, it makes it really tough to live up to that. Would it make my personal Mount Rushmore of burgers that I've had in my life? I don't think so. But was it a no-doubt-about-it 5-star burger? Absolutely."
,,,,,"First off, I think the photos of this thing alone make it tough to get it anything other than 5-stars. That bacon is the thickest I've ever seen in my life and the egg makes it even more photogenic. "
,,,,,"I was nervous that there would be a ridiculous wait, so I called ahead. Unfortunately, they don't answer their phone. I'm not sure they even have an actual phone. But luckily, we were visiting at an off-peak time in the middle of a weekday afternoon, so we snagged two seats at the bar as soon as we walked in. Not only that, but the host even asked us if we would prefer a table! So for all the horror stories I read about with wait times, definitely plan your trip to Au Cheval on a Wednesday afternoon!"
,,,,,"In addition to the zero wait time, our burgers came out incredibly quick. The first couple of bites were everything I'd hoped and dreamed of, but have to admit that the more I ate it, the more my opinion kind of normalized from an all-time burger to just a really good one."
,,,,,"The fries were fine, but definitely not worth the $6.25 price tag. I know it's against most people's religion to not order fries with their burger, but I'd recommend opting for something else."
,,,,,I'm glad I got to try such a famous spot while in Chicago!
,,,,,"I've been hearing about this place for at least 5 years and it's been slowly ramping up the hype for this moment. Over the past year, I have tried and failed to get a seat in Au Cheval because the waits are SO FREAKIN' LONG. When we finally came at 10 AM (opening) on Black Friday, there was no wait!"
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I shared a single cheeseburger (which actually came with two patties) with bacon on top. All I have to say is that... this place is massively overhyped. The bacon is really, really delicious and I can't deny that. It's fatty, crispy, well-seasoned, and thick. Without the bacon, the burger really is not that impressive. The patties were like those of any other burger I've had (e.g. In-n-Out). The cheese was regular old cheese. The brioche buns are a nice upgrade. But the burger costs $12 (WITHOUT the bacon), so I'd much rather have In-n-Out. What makes Au Cheval stand out is their bacon topping. It might be worth the price, but it's not worth the wait. Come here only during random off hours."
,,,,,"Best burger I've ever had.  The meat to cheese ratio is perfect and the bacon is the greatest and tastiest.  It's packed and typically an hour or more wait, for the obvious reasons."
,,,,,"Wow. Au Cheval is truly an incredible burger. The seasonings in the burger was perfect and it was cooked well.They took great care to package everything for takeout. Service was great. Parking is difficult on Randolph, but there are a few spots you can wait on."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,This is probs my fav burger place in the country (not Chicago native kekeke). The bacon is shooooo delicious and flavorful and the fries were great.  
,,,,,Little dark inside tho and hard to get seating and a table so if you go make sure u get there an hour early to reserve a table and then go walk around the surrounding area for fun!
,,,,,Attention: The single cheeseburger has two burger patties and the double cheeseburger has three!
,,,,,"I was super excited to try Au Cheval but knew that the wait would be crazy. So I did the sane thing and came here at... 11pm. I wasn't hungry, but I had to try this place so I thought why not squeeze in a second dinner. There was still a 10 minute wait. "
,,,,,"My boyfriend ordered the double cheeseburger because we didn't know that the single cheeseburger was basically the double! He finished it, but complained about how full he was after. I got the single cheeseburger and couldn't finish it because we were fools and ordered extra food. We added their famous bacon on our burgers which were super thick cut and ordered their crispy potato hash. Everything was delicious. My leftover burger was even better the day after! "
,,,,,This is definitely the place to try if you're in Chicago.
,,,,,"The. Burger. Here. Wow.  Definitely one of the top burgers I have eaten, I ordered the Single, which is really a double (and the double is really 4 patties!), with an egg for under $20 with tip.  I came here around 11PM on a Friday and there was already a line waiting.  Luckily I was by myself so I got seated at the bar immediately.  The guy next to me did not know that a double was 4 patties and couldn't finish his fries, so he gave them to me haha ... the fries were good but a little too salty.  Luckily they now have an Au Cheval in NYC (where I live) so I will be going back for that burger sometime soon!"
,,,,,This is my second time trying the cheeseburger at Au Cheval. The first time was nothing to write home about so I decided to hold off on writing a review thinking my experience was outside the norm. This time we went on a Saturday morning and arrived around 10:15 AM. We were able to get counter seating right away. The service was good and watching the cooks do their thing was pretty entertaining given how busy they were. They definitely have an efficient process of cooking and serving food.
,,,,,"I ordered the cheeseburger with egg and bacon. The egg and bacon were great. But once again I was underwhelmed by the burger. It wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't anything special. It wasn't very greasy which is a plus, but it wasn't especially juicy or flavorful. I've had better burgers (mostly in Texas), and I can't say that this is a burger that I would crave again. I especially wouldn't deal with a long wait to have this burger again. I guess it's just not for me."
,,,,,BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE. THE HYPE IS REAL.
,,,,,I don't know what more I can say that other people haven't but the burger really was perfection. I was one of the luckier ones and only waited about 40 minutes for a table on a Sunday (opens at 9am and I got there around 10:30am). They do have a very convenient texting system so you can put your name down and walk around nearby while you wait (plenty of other bars/coffee shops). The place is SMALL. I could tell why the wait is so ridiculous.
,,,,,"Now, if the wait was not 40 minutes would I have waited 2-3+ hours like some people have? Hell to the no. Yes, this burger was amazing but there is no way I am waiting that long to eat anywhere (but that's just me). So I can see why some people are disappointed with their meal after waiting for sooooo long. If you wait for that long this is probably not as good as it could be because you're just over it by then."
,,,,,"I will say that the fries were standard (have had much better fries elsewhere). I didn't love them compared to my burger, and among 3 people we barely finished half of the fries because we were too busy eating our burger/the fries got pretty soggy after awhile because of the fried egg they put on top. I would order another appetizer to share off of the menu and not get the fries."
,,,,,"This weekend my wife and I went on a food tour of Chicago.  We had heard amazing things about Au Cheval and were excited for the experience.  Hostess was very awkward, bordering on apathetic and rude.  Single burger was average/good.  Nothing jumped out at me about it.  Fries were brought cold-waiter was great and understanding and brought new fries for us (which were excellent).  In my opinion, Au Cheval is serviceable but not a memorable burger experience."
,,,,,"TLDR: not the best burger I've ever had, but still pretty good; worth trying at least once; great craft beer selection"
,,,,,"After living in Chicago for about 2.5 months, finally decided that it was time to try Au Cheval's famous burger. Came for brunch around 12pm on a Saturday and ending up waiting a little over an hour for two seats at the bar."
,,,,,"To drink, I ordered a Maplewood Son of Juice (hazy IPA; guava, mango & tangerine), which was refreshing and a good balance of bitter / fruity. A friend and I shared the crispy fries and each got the cheeseburger a cheval with thick-cut peppered bacon added."
,,,,,"While tasty, there was nothing exceptional about the burger. In addition to the patty, there was American cheese, raw diced red onions, pickles, and a mild sauce of lemon juice, mayonnaise, and Dijon mustard. The burger was elevated a bit from the addition of ketchup and the thick, fatty bacon, which was savory and slightly sweet, but it didn't blow my mind. Overall, would say it was good but probably not all that it's hyped up to be.   "
,,,,,"Similar to the burger, the crispy fries were good, but not super memorable. They were cut in the same way as McDonald's fries and topped with a perfectly fried egg (yolk still runny) and served with mornay sauce and garlic aioli."
,,,,,We couldn't finish everything and left feeling completely stuffed. Would recommend going to check Au Cheval off the Chicago bucket list but think better burgers can be found elsewhere in the city (my favorite so far has been at Mott St).
,,,,,A great burger and beer!
,,,,,"No doubt the Au Cheval burger is good, the best beef in chicago goes into these burgers, you can taste the difference. I like having mine with cheese, lettuce, pickles. No egg for me not a fan and it takes away from the flavor of the beef. A little bit on the greasy side, i know they call it juices it but its more grease than juice. The fries are solid, and if you're adventurous try the fried bologna sandwich!"
,,,,,and by the way sit at the bar if you don't want to wait 2 hours for a table!
,,,,,"That's a tasty burger, I get the double, with bacon and egg. It's over priced but it's a nice treat. Not a fan of the fries."
,,,,,I tried Cheese burger with bacons and an egg.
,,,,,It was tasty but bit salty.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Hyped as one of the best burgers in the US, Au Cheval is known for having excellent food. I've been trying to go for years - with absurd wait times as the blocker - and now that I've checked it off the list, I can say that it's good but there are plenty of other amazing restaurants in Chicago. What can I say that others haven't? Well..."
,,,,,"1. Pro-tip: Go alone. I was in Chicago on a work trip, and ended up snagging at spot at the bar with no wait time. "
,,,,,2. Add bacon and an egg to the burger. Just do it. 
,,,,,"3. The food is good. While it is one of the better burgers I've had, I wouldn't say it's the best. The meat and ingredients are quality and it lives up to its deliciousness, but it's not a unique concept. "
,,,,,4. Cocktails are solid but not the best cocktails I've ever had.
,,,,,"5. Fries are pretty standard, as with the other food. Au Cheval really takes the best ingredients and cooks it well. When it comes to unique flavors, that's where I feel like it's missing something."
,,,,,"It's worth the visit in Chicago no matter what. It's delicious, well-priced, and will satisfy any food craving you have. Now that I've been once, I wouldn't necessarily go again."
,,,,,"Went for the burger... Best burger in the United States they say? Sat at the bar, ordered a single (two patties) with egg and bacon... seen the couple next to me diving into the fried chicken and ordered that up to... burger is simple, nothing to it, simply the best fucking burger ever... and the chicken, WTF... I want more!!!"
,,,,,Thinking about skipping Au Cheval? Do yourself a favor... Don't!
,,,,,"We all love the burger - and it's great. But, they have a fried bologna sandwich that is really special. First, they make the bologna in house. Second, that bun! Do yourself a favor and make sure you get to taste this amazing sandwich. "
,,,,,"All of our food was fantastic. The service was great and I felt totally at ease. Yes, you are likely to wait a really long time. Go put your name on the list and head over to La Colombe for a draft latte. You wont be sad."
,,,,,The burgers are legit so be prepared for a long wait. I remember this place not having reservations and the layout being long and narrow. I went right when dinner service started on a weekday so I was able to get in right away.
,,,,,"I like how their burgers have no real gimmicks to them unless you want to customize it somehow. They're pretty straight forward, juicy, and tender. The burgers looked small so we ordered fries and bone marrow. I've always enjoyed bone marrow and this is no exception. The marmalade gave it a nice sweetness."
,,,,,"I think this might be the closest option to an In-n-out burger out here in Chicago. It is very good, just not as cheap or readily available as the west coast chain."
,,,,,There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about a place like this.
,,,,,"Over time, too many successful establishments develop a stigma rooted in claims of hipster pretension rather than just being accepted for what they offer: quality."
,,,,,"I enjoy the area immensely (West Loop), I enjoy the ambiance (early 20th century bar), and I enjoy the food/service."
,,,,,"Yeah, there's a line. It's a small place. So what? Not like you're going there every day. Just bite the bullet, skip breakfast, bring friends, and enjoy the meal!"
,,,,,"Yelp recommended I review this place, so I figured now was a good time.  I've been here a few times.  This place has the best burger I have ever had, and I feel very confident when I say that.  Get the single and add bacon and an egg.  The bacon is so thick and tasty. "
,,,,,"I've also had the omelette, chopped salad, and chilaquiles, among others.  The omelette is cooked so well.  French style, very light and tasty.  The chilaquiles are super good.  The chopped uses that thick bacon I mentioned earlier, and has a really good creamy dressing.  "
,,,,,"I can't say enough about this place.  You'll have to wait, but the wait is worth it."
,,,,,BEST HASH BROWNS EVER!
,,,,,"Yeah, I know you come for the burger, but man those griddle made taters are amazing! The burger is very good. First time I had the double and added bacon. Was good but felt like it was too much. Bacon was very thick, and normally that would be a great thing, just not here IMO. Now I just stick with the single and add the egg. Bacon on the side if desired. But oh yeah, those HASH BROWNS!"
,,,,,"Hands down best burger I've had. Like my son asked and he answered his own question, ""what other burger can we compare this to?.....None!!"".. I had the ""single"" cheeseburger with thick bacon and egg....the single is made with ""2"" 4oz patties. We also had fries which had a killer mayo/aioli dip. You do get what you paid for here!!...it's pricey but very well worth it.."
,,,,,"On that note, there's a 4% Covid 19 tax that surprised me when I received the check. If that ""extra"" tax is posted somewhere I did not see it,...if it's on the door, the door is wide open and the person sitting you blocks the whole door."
,,,,,"As of today, 7/25/20...outside sitting and some very limited inside sitting."
,,,,,Loved the fried chicken. It was spicy though so if you can't handle spice don't get it. I wanted to try the fries with an egg but they weren't serving it at lunch today so I got the smashed potatoes. They were amazing and I'm surprised more people haven't mentioned them. The chicken is way too much for one person and I was starving. Come hungry. 
,,,,,Update 2020
,,,,,I finally tried the cheeseburger. Omg so good. I would definitely recommend getting it with an egg. Now that you can get it to go the wait isn't bad and I think I'll need to go again this week. Having an Au Cheval cheeseburger with an egg (not like small Cheval) is needed during quarantine.

,,,,,I came here on a Sunday night with a party of 11 and waited about 45 minutes. This spot is pretty small so they just split us up into two different booths. 
,,,,,"Most of us decided to try the cheeseburgers of course. When our food came it was to our surprise that the single cheeseburger actually came with two patties while the double came with three patties! The $5 bacon is definitely worth the add on. The mouthwatering burger was flavorful, perfectly cooked, and juicy. It lived up to all the hype."
,,,,,"Definitely the perfect choice as my last meal during my visit to Chicago. Of course it's pricey for a burger, but if I would recommend people to give this place a try!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Sadly, Au Cheval did not live up to it's hype for me. We came on a Thursday around 1pm and were instantly seated, which was surprising since I've heard the line is usually pretty crazy."
,,,,,"We both ordered the burger since that is what they seem to be known for. I added an egg to mine, and my fiancé added both egg and bacon. The burger patty was a tad dry, and was incredibly salty. The saltiness overpowered everything else that was on the burger, and unfortunately made the meal subpar. Definitely not my favorite burger. I don't think this place is worth it, especially if there's a long wait."
,,,,,"To be honest I come to Chicago from Cali just for this place ahaha and the city lol but this is the best burger joint in the world . What's incredible is the music , the ambiance , the underground vibes and the service . Of course the burgers is just out of this world"
,,,,,"By far the best burger I've ever had. The wait on the weekday is not as bad as people makes it seem. We put our names down on the list, grabbed drinks next door, and was seated all within 45 minutes."
,,,,,"I will admit that the burger is amazingly flavorful and definitely worth the money, but it is not worth the wait. Trust me. "
,,,,,"I went on a Monday night around 6pm, hoping it would not be that long of a line. I was quoted 3 hours. Since I am from out of town, I figured what other opportunity will I have to try this? So I waited. Finally got called around 8:50pm which is pretty close to the 3 hours I was quoted. Ordered the pickleback shot, single cheeseburger with egg and bacon and crispy fries. The shot was strong and totally worth it! The burger was great but honestly I think I've had better elsewhere (Bachi Burger in Las Vegas!). The fries were disappointingly too salty- nothing to write home about. All in all, if I'm judging the food only, definitely a 4 star. But heed my warning, don't wait more than 1 hour for it or else you'd be left disappointed."
,,,,,I really don't need to write a detailed review for Au Cheval.
,,,,,"If you ask anyone in the city they will tell you it's the best burger in Chicago. They're known as that for one reason, it's because the burgers are incredible."
,,,,,Only tip I have for you is to order the bone marrow also.
,,,,,"Amazing burger. While the Bologna sandwich was very good. If you do not have a person with you to split the burger and Bologna sandwich with, stick with the burger. The fries are good but OMG the burger actually lived up to the hype. The egg and pork belly made the burger incredible. I am not the one to stand in line for any hyped up food ao I came here when there was no line at 11 am on a weekday."
,,,,,Always an amazing experience when enjoying the best burger in America! 
,,,,,Before you enjoy this experience a few tips to remember - 
,,,,,"1. The wait has always (we've been 5 times now) been between 1.5 - 3+ hours and you can ONLY put your name on the list in person. No calling ahead. Don't get upset when they don't answer, it is not set up to answer. To combat this we always plan ahead by going to put our name on the list BEFORE we start our morning knowing that we will be doing other things for a few hours while we wait. Then you can text the confirmation number to check and see how much longer the wait is. Perfect for a sight seeing day or if someone in your group is up earlier and doesn't mind running an errand."
,,,,,2. Always add the Egg and Bacon! You won't regret it!
,,,,,"3. It's smaller with tight spaces inside so I would not recommend for parties over 4. We had 5 today and, while it was still a great experience it's not ideal. "
,,,,,"4. The Bloody Mary's are AMAZING! Highly recommended. They are very ""peppery"" so if that's not your preference you may want to specify."
,,,,,"5. The ""regular"" burger comes with two patties and the default is ""medium"". If you order a ""double"" you will get three patties. "
,,,,,This time around we also got the Bone Marrow and it was FANTASTIC! Definitely recommended! 
,,,,,"Overall, this is an experience that will take some planning and commitment but it is absolutely worth it!"
,,,,,Went on a Monday at lunch time to encounter absolutely no wait! We were seated within 5 mins of arriving and ordered:
,,,,,"Scrambled Eggs & Foie Gras: Amazing! Eggs are fluffy, Foie Gras was very rich and every bite was an explosion of flavor. I could have had a whole loaf of toast with this. "
,,,,,"Cheeseburgers: Fantastic. Very well seasoned patties, melted cheese, pickles, eggs and thick cut bacon on a toasted bun. Every component was well made. Thick cut bacon and egg were a great add. Sweet and salty bacon, perfectly cooked egg, juicy patties. Getting hungry just writing this. "
,,,,,Fries with eggs and cheese: Fries were crispy but fluffy. Garlic aioli was amazing. Would order simple fries with extra garlic aioli instead of the cheese though! Still great.
,,,,,Per usual my experience was good. Our wait was 45 minutes and we were seated along that time. It's been a while since I've been here and I decided to bring 2 out of town friends that had heard how great the burgers were. When our food arrived I asked about the Sir Kensington ketchup and the server had no idea what I was talking about. He said they didn't have any specialty ketchup. I was very sad to hear this as it perfect with the burger and FRIES. Totally disappointed about this change. Thank God the garlic aioli is still there!
,,,,,"For everything I've heard about this place, I was expecting much, much more. And I tried my best to like this place."
,,,,,Au Cheval is a restaurant known for its burgers. It's located in the trendy West Loop neighborhood of Chicago near many other trendy spots.
,,,,,I visited Au Cheval during dinner rush and was put on a waitlist for 1hr45min. The wait wasn't so bad as you can set up a text/call notification when they're ready. Visiting the bars next door and enjoying a couple beers will easily pass the time.
,,,,,"Coming back and being seated, I found it hard to get our waiter's attention. The place is always busy so it's easy to understand how they would get occupied. Yet, waiting for 20-30 minutes after almost a 2 hour wait outside can test nerves. We had to call our waiter many times for things as simple as taking our order, water, bill, etc."
,,,,,"My date and I both ordered a double patty burger with cheese, a fried egg, and bacon. This combination seems to be the most recommended among Yelpers. We also ordered fries on the side. Though each ingredient of the burgers we ordered were amazing on their own, altogether, they proved overwhelmingly salty. Unbearably salty. I found myself picking at the bacon and egg rather than taking large bites of the burger. The saltiness of everything overwhelmed my appetite and I had to take the rest home."
,,,,,"2/5. I could have had it on a bad day. Though its worth to try it for the hype, I wouldn't subject myself to another 1hr+ wait for this place again."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Au Cheval was dubbed as the ""Best Burger in America""."
,,,,,That's a damn high title to have to live up to. Did it? Yes and no.
,,,,,"The wait time wasn't too bad for us. There was a line, but when we entered, we got asked for a number and received a text when our table was ready. We walked to the nearby Whole Foods to kill some time while waiting. I think our total wait time was around 20-30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. We were then seated at the bar and got to watch all the chefs at work."
,,,,,"We opted for a ""single"" burger (no cheese) - which came with two patties. You also MUST order the egg and bacon here. Otherwise, what's the point of trying this burger? "
,,,,,"Additionally, we got a crispy potato hash w/ the duck heart gravy."
,,,,,"And you know what? Everything was amazing. The burger was perfectly cooked - a bit medium so that the meat juices still oozed out. The bacon was crispy and rich. The egg, a perfect sunny side up with the yolk oozing out with each bite. "
,,,,,"The crispy potato hash was also delicious. We opted for this instead of the fries, since fries themselves were $6 bucks. This was awesome. Little pieces of duck heart were scattered among the gravy and the potatoes were super crispy. This was an amazing dish but really heavy. "
,,,,,We shared these two items between the both of us and it was one of the few meals we had in Chicago that I didn't take a photo of since we just devoured everything. 
,,,,,"Nevertheless - best burger in America? Not for me, but it's def. a top 5 choice."
,,,,,"""This place isn't closing soon."" -My Girlfriend. "
,,,,,"She's right. Too bad we aren't staying longer, because you don't want to miss out on the burger. A singles enough. The fries are super crispy and my gf never eats fries... until today. "
,,,,,Really wanted to try the fried chicken. 
,,,,,Top notch. Don't miss out on this place.
,,,,,"Alright, I'm not much of a burger person really. I'm satisfied with the typical fast-food joint and never really considered searching for superior burgers. I see burgers how I see hot dogs; how good can they really get? Apparently they can get REALLY good, like Au Cheval's, where everything about their burger is perfection. "
,,,,,I decided to go all out and share a double with an egg and bacon.
,,,,,"The bun was soft, buttery, and its bottom crisp, while the patty is juicy, fatty, and soooo flavorful. As for the bacon, well, it's thick-cut and the sweet glaze compliments it pretty well. Easily the best burger I've ever had."
,,,,,"I also tried their chicken liver with toast and boy, that was DELICIOUS as well. As good as chicken liver and toast can get. The toast was perfectly crisp and the chicken liver was creamy. It didn't have much of the metallic taste that liver is notoriously known for, and the dish pairs nicely with the mini pickles."
,,,,,"If you haven't already, you should give Au Cheval a try. There wasn't a wait when I went around 2 on a weekday. Otherwise, be prepared to camp out."
,,,,,"This place has been on my list for a long time. Stopped by here for lunch and had to wait almost an hour. If you plan on coming here expect a wait at all times. We ordered the double cheeseburger, roasted marrow bone with beef cheek marmalade and a side of toast. Everything on the burger  was delicious from the bun, meat to the egg. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The bone marrow was amazing and one of the best dishes I've ever had. Very rich in flavor and the combination of the marmalade and buttery toast was heavenly. Overall, this place puts extreme detail into everything that they do. Flavors and textures here are on point. If you are visiting Chicago this is a must wait and dine in restaurant. Seating is very limited and not meant for large groups."
,,,,,In town from Texas and was recommended by a friend. It was a great recommendation! I loved all food. One the best burgers I've had
,,,,,"The burger was out of this world. My boyfriend added bacon to his, and it was so good. So glad we had the chance to visit this place, and it was very covid friendly."
,,,,,"This place changed my life. I had to idea that the usual wait time to get into Au Cheval since I went pretty late on a Tuesday night, but I can see why people wait 3+ hours to get in here. Au Cheval is in an unsuspecting building and actually looks like it's closed up, but when you walk inside you're transported into a sexy little diner. Dim lighting, gorgeous decor and blasting music that somehow doesn't make you have to shout to your dinner partners."
,,,,,"Once you get past the coolness of this place you will look at the menu and immediately want to order everything. It's really not a bad idea. My partner and I got the fries, burger and chicken. Hands down the best burger I've ever eaten in my life and the fries and housemade sauce leave you wanting to eat 4 more orders of them."
,,,,,"The chicken is fantastic and comes with hot towels to wipe your greasy little fingers once your done, but I would say always go for the burger if you have to choose. In fact, Au Cheval is my go-to place in Chicago now, I don't think I will be able to pass up on this goodness again, and neither should you. Seriously, it's that damn good."
,,,,,One of the best burgers I've ever had. Triple decker was a great breakfast/brunch. I tend to prefer the thicker patties but the triple decker made up for it. Bacon was fat and carmelized. And the egg yolk to top it off. In my opinion the fries with the egg were not a whole lot better than the regular fries but I may be the odd man out. Wonderful old time diner vibe with great service. Every other booth was filled to observe COVID precautions and we felt very safe.
,,,,,Cheeseburger - 5/5. Best burger I've ever had. Nice sear on the meat. Tasty cheese. So much flavor. No ketchup required. 
,,,,,Fried chicken - 3/5. Sweet and spicy sauce. Decent flavor but wouldn't get again.
,,,,,"Wish I could add something unique to the mass amount of positive reviews, but I just agree. It's a great burger, with the best bacon I've ever had. "
,,,,,"One cheese, which is american cheddar. One temp, medium. Fries were really good. "
,,,,,"Here's my wait experience; got there at 11:30 on Friday morning. Expected to wait an hour from all the yelpers, host said 15 minutes. Got the text that our table was ready in 10 minutes."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Single burger: The burger patty is very juicy. The burger by itself doesn't have a lot of flare. I guess it doesn't really need to be because of their peppered bacon. It's crispy and crunchy on the outside, but it's tender and juicy on the inside. You would think it's hard at first bite, but it almost melts in your mouth. The bacon is crusted with peppercorn so you get a kick of that peppery goodness. Unfortunately, we forgot to ask for a fried egg."
,,,,,"Tip: spread some of the garlic aioli from the fries on the patty. You'll get this perfect buttery garlic taste along with that peppery, salty, Smokey bacon."
,,,,,We put our name down around 12 and walked over to the global McDs for 2 hours until our table was ready. The place is tiny! Maybe like 10 tables total- that's why the wait is so long. We got there for the brunch menu. I got a single cheeseburger- it was just average. I added ketchup and it didn't really help. My husband got the cheeseburger with an egg and bacon. He liked it. The fries were alright.
,,,,,Super expensive!! $103 for four burgers and one shared order of fries for brunch.
,,,,,This place is overrated in my opinion.
,,,,,"TL:DR - Honestly a great burger, but it's not worth over an hour wait. Do it once to say you did, but the cost-benefit ratio from this place to shake shack is not great enough to wait that long. If you do come, get the bacon, it's the only thing that they do better than anywhere else."
,,,,,"I will say I struggled mightily with how to rate this place. On one hand, it's one of the best burgers I've ever had, but it wasn't this mind blowing experience that I couldn't get anywhere else, as everyone who's ever talked about it made it seem. To be 100% honest, it's on the same level as shake shack for me. Like there's different kinds of burger joints, the greasy satisfying comfort food kind (e.g., Five Guys and Shake Shack) and there's the focus on fresh ingredients kind (e.g., In-n-Out) and the we try to get too fancy where it's too pretentious kind (most fancy restaurant burgers). Like at some point, you just can't improve on a burger. You can do something differently, but it's not going to be any better than the great ones already out there. Your ingredients can only get so fresh, your burgers can only get so juicy, and there's only so many different kinds of buns you can get. The only thing that sets this place apart, is there bacon, which is more just thick cut semi-candied pork belly that doesn't have that trademark bacon taste."
,,,,,"I look at Au Cheval like this, I think it's an amazing burger, great taste, super high quality, it's a Chicago institution that you should at least go once for the experience, but it is NOT worth more than an hour wait. Like not even close. Like honestly, it reminds me so much of shake shack, and you never had to wait more than 10 min to place an order there. The cost-benefit ratio is just no there. And that's where I struggle with the ranking. I wanted to give it 4*s because it's not worth the hype, but at the same time, it's clearly not worse than some of the other burger joint 5*s. And the former is a greater travesty, so it gets 5."
,,,,,Ate here one evening and I throughly enjoyed my experience. QR menus and pay your tabs online. Food came out quickly and was super tasty. I had a single cheese burger with fries. The garlic aioli was amazing! Super creamy and just good. My burger came out slight well done but still was juicy. A good burger but $14 I chuck up to being in west loop.
,,,,,"Au Cheval is 100% worth the hype! The burger was melt in your mouth delicious, and the service was wonderful too. You must add the egg and bacon to get the full Au Cheval experience. We saw a table get the friend bologna, and it looked amazing as well, but, as first timers, we stuck with the burger and have no regrets."
,,,,,I'm no stranger to Au Cheval. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the city. 
,,,,,Wait Time: 3/5
,,,,,"Au Cheval is notorious for its infamously long waitlist. There have been times I've gone in and had no wait, or had a 15 minute wait, and there's been times the wait is well over an hour. This time the wait was an hour and 20 minutes but it was for my birthday so I waited. Fortunately west loop has a lot of fun things to do (there's City winery down the street and a number of bars, coffee shops, and stores to explore). "
,,,,,Atmosphere: 5/5
,,,,,"The atmosphere is very cool. I love how small the restaurant is, and how cozy it feels to sit at a table, the bar, or booth. It makes the restaurant feel very intimate without trying. This is a great date night place. "
,,,,,Staff: 5/5
,,,,,"The staff is always awesome. I've never gone in and not had a good experience with the staff. The last two times I was there the staff noticed things I missed. I dropped my fork and before I could find my waiter to ask, a different one saw and was already replacing the fork as I picked my up off the door. I had an issue with my hash browns recently and I wasn't hit with hostility when I asked them to be remade. It was the first time I ever had to ask for that as well. I went most recently in celebration of my birthday and was outed and our server brought us birthday shots to take, which was very nice of her to do. The staff is awesome!!!"
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,"I've eaten through a lot of the menu. The bologna sandwich is to die for and is made in house. The bologna isn't heavy, but the mayo does make it a little heavy. "
,,,,,"Photographed today is the bone marrow, which I was told to try by everyone, the burger (one of Chicago's best), and the general janes honey fried chicken. "
,,,,,Marrow:
,,,,,"The marrow is delicious. It is not what I thought it would be. I will admit the smell was not to be expected, but it does smell very familiar. Spreading the marrow on the bread with the sauce is FANTASTIC. I wish I paid attention to what it was called. The bread helped break up the soft texture since bone marrow is really just fat. This was a new thing for me to try and I was pleased. I'll probably order it again. "
,,,,,The burger:
,,,,,"I love the Au Cheval burger. This wasn't what I got this time, but it is awesome. I took a bite of this one and felt it was too much meat. I'll continue with the single cheeseburger in the future. It's seasoned well, shown well, and is also really good with an egg!!! The burgers side was hash browns and they came out a little over salted but once it was brought up to the waiter it was replaced in minutes. "
,,,,,Wings:
,,,,,"I go to Au Cheval for the wings and the fried bologna sandwich. The wings are super Chrissy, which is hard with a sauce. The chicken is super moist inside and the flavor smacks you in the taste buds!! It's a little spicy so if you are sensitive to spice leave it alone. I love the warm moist towels they provide to wipe your hands. This is not something you can eat and be cute with, so just enjoy. "
,,,,,"Overall, Au Cheval is still one of my favorite restaurants in the city!! Come visit this place you will not be disappointed!!!"
,,,,,"This place is a MUST when visiting Chicago. The wait times can be a bit scary, ranging from 2 to 3+ hours at times. However, this place is open until 1am everyday and until 12am on Sundays. Our party of 3 decided to make our way here directly from the airport around 11:30pm on a Thursday night. The wait for us was only about 25 minutes. "
,,,,,"We started off with their traditional double cheeseburger, fries with garlic aioli and egg, and the General Jane's Honey Fried chicken. Most people opt in for the burger, which is really what this place is known for. The burger definitely lived up to its hype but I highly HIGHLY recommend trying the honey fried chicken. This dish may be overlooked since most people come for the burgers and I really didn't see much about it in the reviews. BUT BRUH THAT CHICKEN WAS PHENOMENAL...I don't know what that sauce is made out of but I could drink it on its own all day long. The chicken was perfectly crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. Paired with the sweet/spicy/ tangy sauce it was truly a match made in heaven. The fries were also very delicious and fresh. The addition of the egg on top was really nice. "
,,,,,"Overall, this place was a 10/10 in my books and I can truly see what all the hype is about!"
,,,,,"Long wait but fantastic food. I got the single with egg and bacon, I loved the egg but the bacon was a bit too tough for me."
,,,,,"This is the best tasting burger I've ever had. I love that it's low key, they serve you fast, and the staff is great. My baby wishes our favorite location wasn't under the El train tracks, but you can't have everything I guess!"
,,,,,Food was delicious I will agree to that but the price of it was not really worth it tbh. It's a nice spot to go to and have drinks and eat but everything was pretty pricy. The bacon was hella bomb though I will say that!
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"First time back to this place in a couple years. The burger is still greatness, but maybe my palate has changed since I first tried this burger of burgers. The bacon is still bliss, but the aioli and saltiness was sort of overwhelming this time around. The servers don't seem to care much and rarely checked on us, so maybe the lack of hospitality slightly ruined the experience. I used to love the mashed potatoes and gravy, but they removed it from the menu. Sad. If you have tried and like the fries the mashed potatoes were soooo much better. Oh yeah, also the chicken is still finger lickin' good!"
,,,,,Best burgers in Chicago PERIOD.
,,,,,The wait time is usually 2 hours but it's well worth the wait!
,,,,,"My god! This damn burger assuredly built by rocket scientists still haunts me. Such a lovely, elegant place filled with wafts of class, the cacophony of character, and the chagrin of chef's unhappy with just ""good enough."" The music was lively and movable; this place is very warm, like an old tavern rich with mahogany and many leather-bound books - Oscar Wilde haunts a corner, contemplating the implications of it all. Having said that, the elegance and pretentious grace of the decor matched exactly - Nay, was thusly exceeded - by the quality and precision found in the food itself!"
,,,,,"We ordered a medium single-double with egg and bacon - yeah, it was $18, and parking was like $4; but don't come to Chicago with limiting thoughts of penny pinching - because you simply mustn't. Each component achieved the very pinnacle of their respective excellence, stopping precisely on the razor's edge of perfection; it all blending into the best of everything wrapped in dreams. The precision salted and perfectly temperate meat had actual flavor, borrowing from the subtle, hidden compounds only ever found for those professionals whom know where to look on that heavily seasoned grill of myriad burgers and too much time. "
,,,,,"The bacon had the texture of ham, but with the sensibilities of the most perfectly salted bacon, balancing the sandwich with such a superlative flavor element. The brioche was actual true-to-form brioche, and as fresh as if they made it themselves not 30 minutes before serving. "
,,,,,For what is was - I swear to God - might be the best burger to ever be made by man.
,,,,,"Absolute mastery of execution, and nothing more. No novelty. I'm honestly sad I'll not be able to enjoy that level of acumen in my respective city. Bravo, chaps!"
,,,,,"As always, great burger and fries. I feel like the burger is different from when I had it 5 years ago, but still really good."
,,,,,"LOVE LOVE LOVE Au Cheval! It truly is the best burger in America! You HAVE to get the thick cut bacon and egg on your burger. Keep the burger as is! It's made to perfection, literally! "
,,,,,"Warning, there is a 2-3 hour wait depending on the time of day. I recommend going around 11am to put your name in for a lunch around 1pm or so. Just drop in and put your name in & then go do something else! Expect a long wait. It's a quant place! But worth it. "
,,,,,Appetizer MUST: Bone Marrow!! It is such a delicacy and it came with a bacon jam that was to die for! I have been here many times but this was the first time I got the Bone Marrow and now I will get it every single time! 
,,,,,"Bloody Mary's are delicious! They are topped with pickles, celery, and peppers! It's almost like a meal in itself. "
,,,,,"PS: I wish I remembered our servers name because she was the worst with a bothered mindset and attitude at the beginning of our meal. She left our table for 5 mins and came back refreshed with a better attitude and smiles! I am glad that she fixed it, but it still must be noted."
,,,,,Honestly the best bacon I have tried with their burger! It is to die for! You have to try their crispy hash browns and fires. 
,,,,,"I thought Denver, Colorado had the best burger. You proved me wrong again Chicago!"
,,,,,I've been here twice and both times have gotten super lucky with the wait. 
,,,,,First visit: A Tuesday night for dinner- only about a 30 min wait around 6pm.
,,,,,Second visit: A Saturday afternoon around 4:30pm. Wait for tables was about 1.5 hours but we snagged 2 seats at a section of the bar which was first come first served. 
,,,,,I enjoy my single burger (really it's 2 patties) with the thick cut bacon! I've gotten it with the egg once but can do without it. The fries are also good too. Overall a delicious burger and worth the visit if you're willing to wait. My recommendation is to leave Au Cheval for special occasions and visit Small Cheval more regularly.
,,,,,"This Au Cheval is highly recommend, it is so easy to go here, it is the best and great place I have ever been. Really love their store vibes and their food as well, they have so simple menu but so sensational. Their burger is phenomenal, I recommend to you to add bacon, it is so great to have a bacon even on the side. They have so excellent burgers and fries, as well as their cocktails, all of it are so amazing. Their customer service is so incredible, they will serve your order so quick, you have to wait for 5 to 10 minutes only. Their employees are so nice and decent, they will accommodate you from the start until you finish eating and enjoying their place. All of them are so professional and they all know how to treat and serve all of their customers so well. Their place is so awesome, it has a great atmosphere, and everything there is so worth it. So I suggest to all of you to go here and stop by, try some of their food, and enjoy everything at their store from their great place to their phenomenal menu. Most people here in Chicago will tell you that this Au Cheval is one of the best place for burgers and this is probably their favorite place to go to. 5-star for this store because of their great service, awesome employees, wonderful place, and for their amazing food. Overall is so great. Will introduce this to all of my friends and family, so that they can also visit here and get some food. And also will definitely go here again when I am nearby. Thank you Au Cheval, keep it up! Good job guys!"
,,,,,"BEST DAMN BURGER EVER! I am still reminiscing about this and dreaming about when I will get a chance to bite into this amazing burger once again. Of course, there's the infamous 2-4 hour wait here but just takes some strategic planning. We arrived at 4pm to place our name on the waiting list with an estimated 1.5-2 hour wait. Instead, it turned out to be ready in less than the hour and a half for a table of five. I'd highly recommend coming early and assuming a long wait, so it's no surprise."
,,,,,"Since I did not know when I'd be back in Chicago again and made it through the wait to eat here, I went all the way with the Double Cheeseburger ($14.95) with Egg (+$1.00) and Bacon (+$3.50). Even though this comes out to a pretty pricey burger, it's well worth it! Take note that the Single Cheeseburger comes with two patties while the Double Cheeseburger comes with three. The waiter warned me as I made my order for a double, but challenge accepted. In the end, I won victory and finished the entire burger plus some of my friend's leftover bacon from her burger. Trust me, I could leave no bacon behind because this thick, juicy, glazed and peppered bacon was out of this world! The bacon is an absolute must!"
,,,,,"For the table, we also shared two orders of the fries ($6.25) per waiter's recommendation. The fries were undeniably crispy, salty, and fatty --so good! They were paired with an aioli sauce that was light yet creamy. I couldn't help but add some onto my burger as well. This is a must everytime in Chicago from now on --worth the wait!"
,,,,,Hmm. This burger was the best burger I have ever had. Even 1 month later I am still thinking of this burger. It is worth the 3.5hr wait!! 
,,,,,Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. THIS WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD! The hash browns were thin and crispy. The duck meat and heart gravy was so savory.
,,,,,"Thick cut peppered bacon. These are THICK pieces of bacon! It was essentially pork belly. The only thing is, it is on the sweeter side."
,,,,,"Double cheeseburger. AND HERE IS THE LEGENDARY 3.5HR WAIT DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER, WHICH ACTUALLY HAS 3 PIECES OF BEEF IN IT. IT WAS 10000X BETTER THAN IT LOOKS. IT WAS SO. FREAKING. DELICIOUS."
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,-fattiest beef patties ever. They take their meat seriously in Chicago
,,,,,-food is good all around
,,,,,-service was amazing
,,,,,-the wait isn't so long when you wander and do other things. You can reply to their initial text as many times as you want to get an update on how many parties are ahead of you 
,,,,,-plenty of nearby restaurants and bars to walk around to 
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,-just the long wait but it's worth it
,,,,,Tip: do something else while waiting!
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Phenomenal. The wait was shorter than I thought it would be (30 minutes). The burger was amazing and it's worth every single penny.
,,,,,"Being a fast food burger connoisseur, I knew I would have to try ""the best burger in America."" "
,,,,,"But first - the starters. The bone marrow appetizer is utterly forgettable. The consensus of our table was that it just tasted like salty fat. However, it came with a beef cheek marmalade which was tangy and sweet and tasted good atop Texas toast. We got a side of the crispy fries which came with an egg on top, with dipping sauces of gravy and aioli on the side. The egg was super salty but the gravy was more subtly flavored and savory. Very tasty. When the burger came out, expectations were high. I ordered a double burger (three patties) with an egg and bacon with everything on it. The bacon was super thick and looked super seasoned. Again, the egg was super salty - someone seasoned it with a clumsy hand and it basically made every bite of the burger taste salty. I was disappointed by the quality of the vegetables on the burger - the onions and pickles were almost unnoticeable. The pickles in particular were super flaccid and not crispy or flavorful. The Dijonnaise tasted like nothing sauce. The burger as a whole tasted like something I could get from Red Robin - not the best in America. Not worth it if you have to wait in line."
,,,,,"After nearly 3.5 years and multiple failed attempts to visit Au Cheval, I finally made it through the doors and to a table on 10/22/18. Fun story: the first time I came here in 2015, I made the mistake of trying to eat dinner here with a group of 3 on a Saturday night. When I walked up to the hostess and asked for a table, she said (with a perfectly straight face), ""sure I'll put you down, the wait will be about four and a half hours"". ... Fast forward to 2018, my friends and I decided to grab lunch on a Tuesday and expecting at least an hour or two wait, I was shocked to find that there was...(get ready for it..) NO wait for a table for three. I got over it quickly after reminding myself that I have suffered enough in the last three years so totally deserved this."
,,,,,"As for the food, we ordered a few classic single cheeseburgers + bacon + egg, fries, and the matzo ball soup. The reason for the four stars is that the burger was good, but it wasn't as spectacular and memorable as I imagined it would be, especially given the hype. The patty was juicy and flavorful, and the egg was a great edition, but I think I probably could have had it without the bacon. The fries were crispy and the delicious, and the soup was also just okay. "
,,,,,"I would certainly come back if I knew the wait time was appropriate, but otherwise Small Cheval is probably just as good."
,,,,,Okay..I've been here a few more times since my first review. Literally everything that I've said in my original review plus a couple more tidbits that I felt really elevated my burger eating experience.
,,,,,1. Please do yourself a favor and order the beef cheek marmalade as a side for your burger. Like PLEASE do it. The marmalade typically comes as a spread for their bone marrow. It just adds ANOTHER (!!) layer of flavor to your burger. I won't order another Au Cheval burger without it. It is more important to me than the pork belly bacon and the duck egg. 
,,,,,"2. Root beer on draught, yes. But I would encourage you to get the chocolate martini. So delicious!"
,,,,,"A true life-changing experience. French-themed, upscale diner whose main attraction is a burger. If you're looking to go to Au Cheval, I would recommend going during off hours (before/after lunch/dinner). I've been fortunate both times I've been here to wait only 30-45 minutes. I always ask what the wait is on my way out the door and have been told as long as 2-3 hours (insane). "
,,,,,This place is really terrible for big groups. Most of the seating arrangements are for 1-4 people. They do have 2 larger booths that may accommodate up to 6 but I image they are hard to come by. 
,,,,,"I ordered the single burger with bacon (pork belly) and an egg. The single burger is actually 2 patties and the bacon (2-3 slices) is as thick as the patty! I usually am anti-egg on my burgers but had to go all out for my first experience. I am glad I did!! The egg was a perfect compliment to the burger and was so subtle. If I could choose one word to describe the patties, it would be succulent. So incredibly juicy and tender. And don't even get me started on their 5 star buns...."
,,,,,"Their burgers are the epitome of the ultimate clash of flavors that just work. Between the buns, patties, bacon, egg, and cheese. I would recommend this burger to burger lovers and non-lovers."
,,,,,"Finally was able to get into Au Cheval! Here's the trick and my tip. If you plan on going for lunch, I would get there around 10:30-11 since there's almost always at the very least an hour's wait. When we a spot opened up for us around 12:45, we heard the host say the wait was 3 hours! The earlier you can put your name down, the better. "
,,,,,"The place is known for its burgers and it does not disappoint. There's many different ways you can order your burger -- as a single or a double, with or without American cheese, and you can add an egg and/or bacon as well. All sides (fries, hash browns, etc.) are served a la carte. "
,,,,,"I ordered the single cheeseburger au cheval (which actually comes with 2 relatively small/thin patties). The au cheval style comes with dijonnaise, diced onions, and pickles on a brioche bun. Overall, it was a very tasty burger with great flavors and quality ingredients. There were a few refinements I would make to make this even better. There was a ton of dijonnaise, which almost overpowered parts of the burger. The meat itself was very good but looked a little too rare for my liking. Next time I will be sure to clarify the degree of doneness, since it may be the restaurant's style to cook them all uniformly. "
,,,,,Was it a perfect burger? No. Was it good? You bet! I really enjoyed having thin patties rather than a huge one that's difficult to eat. This place is worth the wait!
,,,,,"This is only the start of my journey of hunting the best burger on earth  Make sure you ask them to add a piece of foie gras in top of that thick-cut bacon and let the fatty juicy of foie gras, silky yolk, bacon, and burger burst in your mouth all together"
,,,,,Def worth the wait!!!
,,,,,"One of the best burgers in Chicago! If you are in Chicago and you have time to go, totally recommend! But for a fair warning, go on a weekday or right after you get off work. The wait time for this place can be 1+ hours. "
,,,,,"Au Cheval is best known for their burgers with an egg on top with bacon. The egg is perfected cooked sunny side up egg, and the bacon is basically pork belly to me. So amazingly good! The house made fried bologna sandwich is very good and in my opinion super underrated! "
,,,,,"I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant, its kinda like a diner vibe but more high end. Its has open kitchen, so you can see all of the chefs making the food. It's very organized and person has their own designated station."
,,,,,"The humble burger doesn't get the most cred when it comes to higher end food (maybe this is less of an issue in the Midwest, where there's some quality American food IMO). HOWEVER Au Cheval quickly throws that stereotype out of the window."
,,,,,"The patty was juicy, rich, flavorful and perfectly paired with the thick cut of bacon. Tbh I don't even like bacon usually because I think of it as greasy and unhealthy, but the beef and bacon both pull their weight in making this a 5 star experience. What's awesome is that the burger wasn't messy either despite all the juicy goodness (and runny egg) waiting between the buns. Lives up to the hype! "
,,,,,Also got the Bone Marrow to switch things up which was also good but a little on the heavy side - especially if you order both. The burger is the star of the show here.
,,,,,I came at an awkward hour (2:30pm) on a weekday so there was no wait and would highly recommend doing the same if possible! The burger is delightful but I'm not sure I would wait 2-3 hours for it
,,,,,I was just really hungry the 1st time and it was phenomenal when hungry as heck.
,,,,,It's kind of expensive and kind of dry but still great.  Not sure if its the best burger I've had now after the 2nd time
,,,,,"KICKS Kuma's Corner's burgers arse.  Probably, the best burgers in Chicagoland.  They are super dense and flavorful."
,,,,,"The fries are plain, but with their mayonaise sauce they are unlike any other fries.  "
,,,,,Their prices are FAIR unlike alot of hoity toity high glass restaurants  that overcharge.  You get a good price on great food at Au Cheval.  
,,,,,"The only problem is there's only 1, and it's concentrated as a dine in only place, but it is always packed and hard to get a seat.  They don't do reservations online so it's come and wait for about an hour or more for a seat!"
,,,,,"Not sure how I've been to Chicago almost a dozen times and this was my first time trying Au Cheval, but glad I did.  Awesome location for meat lovers.  Long long wait to be seated, but worth every minute of it.  Location is great, so put your name down and go walk around and maybe grab a beer at a different pub till your turn is up.  The bone marrow was amazing.  So much bone marrow to enjoy.  I got the double burger and oh my was I full after the two dishes.  Loved it.  Can't wait to go back."

,,,,,Au cheval has been on my foodie bucket list for years and I finally had to the chance to go this summer. They don't take make ahead reservations and waits can be up to 4 hours so make sure you go early! I stopped by to put my name down with a friend at 4pm and we were told it would be a 2 hour wait so we went to get nails done around the corner and were able to check out place in line on our phones. There is plenty to do in the area to kill time. 
,,,,,The wait is 100% worth it. This was the BEST burger I have ever had with the BEST bacon on top. The fries were also delicious and I recommend pairing it with an Alagash white from the bar. I wish that I had room to eat another burger. 
,,,,,Au Cheval is an amazing establishment with extremely friendly and attentive wait staff. I was lucky enough to sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook right in front of me while I ate. They chefs were chatty and I highly recommend sitting at the bar and learning from them 
,,,,,Service: 5 stars 
,,,,,Food: 5 stars 
,,,,,Atmosphere: 4 stars (a little loud and dark)
,,,,,Price: 3 stars (pricey for a burger but so worth it)
,,,,,"I gave this place 2 stars because of the wait + the food didn't live up to the hype. I'm sorry, but to wait 2 and a half hours for this food is just not worth it. There is only a single burger option."
,,,,,"I have gladly waited in line for hours for food, and usually when the wait is that long, you quickly see why. I feel like at au cheval I never understood what exactly was taking so long, not did I feel the whole experience merited the weight. "
,,,,,"Their menu doesn't  have that many options, and most people are going for the burger, so it's not like people need a lot of time to decide what they are going to eat. "
,,,,,"The ambiance in the place is nice, albeit very small, maybe it's time they look for a bigger location to accommodate more guests?"
,,,,,"The food itself (specifically the burger) just isn't worth it. I feel like If I have to wait HOURS for your food, I better be telling everyone they need to try it once in their life. But there is really nothing memorable about this burger. It's big, and it's hard to finish, that's about it. Oh yea, it's also super salty. Maybe people who never had well-seasoned food thinks this is what makes it taste so good?"
,,,,,"The reason this review doesn't have 1 star is because of the Bacon. The bacon is seriously good, it's a shame though because you don't even really get to taste it on the burger itself. Overall I don't think I would ever go here again, it's just not worth the wait. "
,,,,,Don't believe the hype/10
,,,,,Love this place. Duck heart gravy is a very underrated dish. 
,,,,,Burger. Of course. Incredible.
,,,,,"Anytime a restaurant or dish achieves the distinction of being the best in the city, country or world several things will usually happen. .."
,,,,,"One, crowds and wait times will grow exponentially. "
,,,,,"Two, service will suffer until the business adapts to new found fame. "
,,,,,"Three, sheep will rave and blindly profess their love and adoration (while affirming it's the best in the entire city despite never traveling South of Roosevelt). It may be the best, but how would you know? Lol"
,,,,,"Four, Foodies with well versed palates will mostly agree with the awesomeness bestowed, but some will reasonably disagree. "
,,,,,"Five, haters who know very little about the nuisances of delicious food and the science behind it will overdo it with unreasonable critiques."
,,,,,"Six, every new competitor will be touted as the ""fill-in-the blank Killer""."
,,,,,"Au Cheval has experienced each of these. Being ranked a top burger has been controversial to some, but that's one of the great things about food. We're all entitled to like or dislike whatever we choose. But. ..with that being said anyone who says this isn't a great burger is just plain wrong ;-)"
,,,,,"As everyone else has yelped the burgers are simple and once you add the thick cut bacon, a perfect balance of smoky, salty, rich and cheesy awesomeness.  Aside from the burgers, fries and drinks I can't say I particularly like or dislike anything else on the menu, but what else do you need, lol.  The Vieux Bonal is greatness in a glass. Try it."
,,,,,"BEST BURGER YOU WILL EVER HAVE!! It makes the three hour wait actually worth it. If you go at the right time the wait is significantly less than that though. Most recently, I didn't have to wait at all believe it or not. That was in the middle of the day on a Friday. I actually got the recommendation to try this place from a fitness instructor, so if someone who is all about exercise and dieting is taking about how good this burger is then it's gotta be good.  Just get the burger and fries and you will be more than happy."
,,,,,Oh my is all I can say.  We got there at 10:45 am today.  We got right in.  We had a single and double cheeseburger both with an egg and bacon.  We got the hash with duck gravy.  We also got the bologna sandwich.  The burger was definitely the best we've had. Homemade bologna was also over the top!  Would eat every dish again!
,,,,,Yes. The burgers are actually that good. 
,,,,,"We didn't have to wait long due to going during the pandemic, but I'd wait for hours to have that burger again lol."
,,,,,Sigh.....I hate that my review is only 3 stars.  
,,,,,"Au Cheval was on the map for my gf and I when we had a weekend getaway to Chicago.  Several friends recommended it, many told us to get there as early as we could, and all of the recommendations and advice were backed up by several yelp reviews and articles saying how amazing this burger place was."
,,,,,"We showed up around 10:45 am on a Saturday, and sure enough, a line was getting close to being out the door.  Staff told us it would be 30 minutes or so, but fortunately it was only about 15 minutes worth of waiting.  "
,,,,,"Let me also say that staff were great, both with explaining dishes, giving recommendations for tourists and getting us seated very quickly.  Kudos guys!"
,,,,,So we ordered the following:
,,,,,Crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy ($10.95)
,,,,,Cheeseburger au cheval ($12.95) + 2 extra patties ($4)
,,,,,"Both dishes came out at the same time, and we split both of these.  Starting with the crispy potato hash, it comes as listed, very crispy potato hash, chopped pieces of duck meat with organ meat from the duck as well.  A Sunny side up egg completed the package, which made the dish all the more moist once the yolk was broken."
,,,,,"The potato hash was super rich with its gravy, and while it was flavorful, I personally couldn't eat more than a few bites because with each bite, my mouth was coated with butter/oil.  It's hard to make certain greasy spoon dishes seem healthy, but at least for the hash, it just was so saturated with grease.  I think it's a much better dish if shared between several people, but for me, I just thought it was too rich, although the flavors were nice."
,,,,,"The cheeseburger was pretty big!  The meat was also moist and juicy leaving not a single bite that was dry.  Great cook on this burger!  The big problem, which made me take off stars was just how salty things were.  "
,,,,,"It could have been the cheese, it could have been the seasoning, it could have just been an off day for the chef, but man it was loaded with salt.  "
,,,,,"In front of Au Cheval, there is parking, although a very small amount.  Not being a regular and walking to this burger shop, I can't speak on where else you can find parking."
,,,,,"Would I have rated my experience much more highly if the burger wasn't super salty?  I definitely would have given it 4 stars at the least.  I really enjoyed my time in Chicago, and plan to visit again before the year is over.  I'll likely give Au Cheval a second chance and hopefully my experience will lead to a much higher review, but for now, it was a bit off for us."
,,,,,YESSSS.
,,,,,"Came early, around 10ish on a weekday"
,,,,,"Got the duck heart gravy hash, the single cheeseburger +bacon/egg, and the foie gras scrambled eggs"
,,,,,The duck heart gravy hash paled in comparison to the cheeseburger and scrambled eggs
,,,,,But was still really delicious
,,,,,The gravy was amazing
,,,,,"The leftovers were great, but a bit salty"
,,,,,The cheeseburger was perfect!
,,,,,Simple but delicious
,,,,,The bacon was so thicc
,,,,,The scrambled eggs though
,,,,,o m g
,,,,,they were the best eggs I've ever had
,,,,,Will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago
,,,,,"It is always crowded unless you arrive super early around 1:00 pm or very late around 11:30 PM. We were lucky finally to obtain a table at 11:30 PM (not a great time to eat a greasy meal but it is au cheval and we wanted to try it so bad). I ordered a cheeseburger that contains an egg and a pickle on the side. It is definitely one of the great burgers I tried, but not the BEST. I definitely had a more unique gourmet burger. I can understand the hype though since the patty was mouthwatering and covered with deliciousness. Recommended :)"

,,,,,Overrated burger that you can get at Small Cheval.  No thanks.  Pass on waiting hours in line.
,,,,,"I went to this location before the pandemic hit us. After a 5 hour wait, we finally got our tables. This place had long wait times from very start. "
,,,,,"We ordered fried chicken, chilaquiles, bone marrow, and of course the burger."
,,,,,"The winner was the chilaquiles, followed by bone marrow, burger and then the fried chicken."
,,,,,"Chilaquiles had perfect proportion of chips, sour cream, guac and spices. "
,,,,,The bone marrow was surprising hit as well. The bread and jam went great with it.
,,,,,"The burger was a good 4/5. When I think of great burgers, places like hop doddy in texas comes in to mind. Au cheval is up there but there is no specialty about this burger that I can rave about. It is fresh, it is juicy, it is a true american delight but it is comparable. "
,,,,,The fried chicken was amazing. I am big fan of fried chicken and this one had the right blend of sweet n spiciness to it. No complains.
,,,,,"Overall, a great experience, and very good food. 4 stars!"
,,,,,High expectations going in based on the Yelp reviews and was also recommended this place. The burger did not disappoint! 
,,,,,"I've heard this place has a long wait time to be seated, but luckily I came on a rainy day later at night. The inside is pretty small - half bar, half sit down area. It's pretty dimly lit during the evening/night time I guess to set the mood."
,,,,,"Service was excellent. I ordered a single (really it's a double) with cheese, egg, pickles, some type of mayo/mustard sauce, and THICK slices of bacon. First bite was so juicy, and the egg held up for the most part. "
,,,,,Really tasty hamburger and fries. 
,,,,,"This is an excellent place for a burger and fries. A bit on the greasy side for me, but that's what makes a good hamburger I suppose. Definitely a cheat meal if you're not used to eating unhealthy."
,,,,,"Came here during my visit to Chicago to try what everyone claims to be the best burger ever. While it was definitely good, I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had, and I don't know if it's good enough to be worth the wait."
,,,,,"We came on a Thursday night at 9pm thinking it wouldn't be too busy anymore. However, it was packed and we were still quoted a wait time of 2-2.5 hours for a party of 2. Luckily, there are a lot of bars nearby, so we just went to grab some drinks while we waited. We only ended up waiting a little over an hour before receiving the text that our seats were ready. We were okay with bar seating but if you want a table or booth, you may have to wait a little longer. "
,,,,,"I tried the single cheeseburger with a fried egg and bacon, as well as the fries to share. This was more than enough food and I felt stuffed afterwards. Their ""single"" cheeseburger is actually a double, as there are two patties. While I don't generally like bacon, I was still able to appreciate the texture and flavor of their bacon. It's more of a thicker cut of pork belly, but I would recommend adding it to your burger if you're a fan of bacon. Their fries and sauces were delicious, but I'm always a sucker for fries."
,,,,,"All in all, the burger was really good but I'm not sure it would be worth it to wait any longer than an hour. I'd only recommend coming if you already had plans in the area, so that you can put your name down beforehand, go see/do whatever you had planned, and come back when your table is ready."
,,,,,"The burger was amazing!  But is it the best burger in America?  I can't say that, but it's up there for sure.  It didn't give me the wow factor that I was looking for.  Maybe it's because I set the bar pretty high given the hype and the normal 2-4 hour wait.  "
,,,,,Pro tip- go during the weekday when it opens at 11am.  We were seated immediately.  Order the burger as is and add egg and bacon.  Don't mess with the order.  This is how you can get the best experience.  I have read other reviews about how the burger tasted like other fast food burgers or how the meat patty was too dry.  They probably ordered the burger with no egg or bacon hence they just ordered a regular burger.  Also when you order your patty well done it's gonna come out dry.  Again don't mess with the order and it should come out fantastic!!!
,,,,,Best burger I have ever had!
,,,,,We walked it and the place was packed. They said it would be an hour wait and we knew this going in. We put out name on the list to be texted when our spot was ready and walked over to the bar nextdoor.
,,,,,When we came back at 10pm they were still packed and we were seated. We all got the single cheese burger with an egg and thick cut bacon. It was amazing. each patty is 4oz so the single burger is really 2 4oz patties they make there. The thick cut bacon was around a quarter inch think and I would put that at another 4oz of meat. It was crazy good.
,,,,,We split one order of fries and all had some drinks. All in each burger was about $20 well worth the price.
,,,,,The place has an amazing vibe generated by the candles that light it and the 80's hip hop mixtapes they use for sound. They are really mix tapes on a big old school reel to reel tape deck.
,,,,,This is a place you need to check out if you are into a fun burger place that is deserving of its buzz.
,,,,,Great tasting burgers and that whiskey milkshake was amazing. Will definitely come back for that.
,,,,,"Was extremely excited to go to lunch at Au Cheval as soon as indoor dining was approved. I know that they have what is considered one of the best burgers of all time, and I couldn't wait to try it. "
,,,,,"We arrived, they were very on top of hygiene and took all precautions. We are led to our seat and the dining room was FRIGID. We were assured it would warm up but sadly never did."
,,,,,"We sat, looked at the menu and were very pressed to put in our entire order. We understand, they want to time it out for us but it quite frankly felt very rushed and pushy. "
,,,,,"We started with a Bloody Mary (sadly not good at all very very bitter) and some bone marrow (very tasty). Then came a Caesar salad (absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try), and then our burgers and loaded fries. Biggest letdown ever. Fries were a sad soggy affair and the burgers were so thin and dry it was actually funny. "
,,,,,Wish I could experience what everyone adores them for but sadly this wasn't it.
,,,,,"Came here tonight for a catch - up date with an old friend. I have been wanting to try Au Cheval for a while now and she had already been here a couple times. It's been named the best burger in the nation, I had to see what the commotion was all about. pleased to say that it was worth the $15 burger. "
,,,,,The order:
,,,,,- The single cheeseburger: It came with two patties and it was delicious! Some things I could do without: there was quite a bit of black pepper but  I will ask for it less next time. The buns were heavily buttered. I would ask for less butter next time. I asked for my egg to be well-done but it was still gooey. 
,,,,,"- Fries: pretty good, next time I think I'll try the hash browns. "
,,,,,- My friend got the fried bologna sandwich with bacon - so my taste buds can't confirm but my friend raved about it. 
,,,,,"I liked it and would come back, took out a star because of the butter'd buns and too much pepper."
,,,,,Our server Molly was wonderful. The bus boy Trevor was also very accommodating and warm and so friendly. Everyone seemed to work really well together and the wait wasn't long at all. Molly even made sure my cherry soda was always filled.

,,,,,"We had reservations for another neighboring restaurant and once my son who lives in Chicago heard we'd be in the area said we needed to cancel the reservation and try to get a seat at Au Cheval instead.  With that type of recommendation we had to take his advice....soooo glad we did!  This was an EPIC meal!  When we first perused the menu my hubby said ""man they're proud of their burgers"" cause wow the price was pretty steep...once we took a bite he changed his tune.  O M G this is a damn good burger.  Up their in the top 3 I've ever had and I'm a burger bitch baby!!! The appetizer of bone marrow w/ the beef cheek marmalade is a must have also.  Sooooo rich but the marmalade helps to cut that.  It's like eating a piece of the best toast you've ever had, topped with beef butter & the perfect sweet yet tangy marmalade.  It works and it's life changing!!!!  We'll be dreaming of this meal for a looong time! "
,,,,,"They had plenty of outdoor seating and they were very covid clean friendly (constantly cleaning, wiping, fresh utensils, glasses, water bottles, etc...)"
,,,,,The food was good. Burger was delicious. Drinks were a bit overpriced for the amount of alcohol given. Unique but limited menu but everything was great.
,,,,,"Amazing burgers, just a great joint with no variety which is good because they know how to do little things great."
,,,,,"This is my second time at Au Cheval. Came on a Monday morning for breakfast. Disappointed that they have a limited menu now due to covid. The tables are out on the front street. Ordered a Bloody Mary, it was crusted with salt and spice on the rim and piled with pickles. The burger was tasty Added an egg on top, just wished it wasn't so greasy, came with nice crispy fries on the side. Also shared a plate of bone marrow amongst the table, it's a must! Enjoyed my meal, I was full for the whole day!"
,,,,,"Frankly their famous burger is just meh, way too much meat. But the foie gras scrambled eggs and toast is divine."
,,,,,I am the ultimate hypebeast. I am not ashamed to say. I love places with hour long waiting lines because there is a line for a reason. I was left disappointed by Au Cheval. Their burger was simply subpar. I got a single cheeseburger with egg and bacon. With all those salty ingredients you would think the burger would have some kind of flavor and it didn't. The French fries are meant for sharing and were delicious but needed a pinch of salt. No need to wait in line for this place.
,,,,,Oh the long awaited Au Cheval experience was nothing short of amazing. I'm not a big meat eater and certainly not a hamburger person but my friends and family have been clamoring about this place so I had to go! We came in on a Monday afternoon around 2 pm with a party of 5 and the anticipated wait time was 3 hours. To hold us over we opted to go to some other local spots. Our wait only ended up being 2 hours which was not bad at all. 
,,,,,Once you walked in you felt like you were home. The vibe and ambience were perfection. The service was incredible. Our waitress was so kind and helpful. The food is 5 stars. Like wow! Best burger I have ever had in my life. It lived up to the hype! I had a single cheeseburger with bacon and an egg. So much food! You cannot order a burger without it. Changes the entire flavor profile. My mouth is watering as I type. We also had the fries and the pickles. Perfection. The cocktails are also great! You can't go wrong here! Do yourself a favor and put yourself on the waitlist...wait 2-3 hours...it's worth the wait...and then enjoy the most incredible burger that you will ever lay your teeth into...the end.
,,,,,"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO! Always a must when I'm in town. The wait for dinner and on weekends is usually long, however for lunch on a weekday you'd expect to wait around 20-30 minutes at most."
,,,,,"I usually order the bone marrow and cheeseburger here. The food is quite heavy and usually puts me in a food coma afterwards but it's so delicious. The burger itself is pretty big, I would recommend splitting a burger and ordering some more sides to get the chance to try out everything :)"
,,,,,Ok so most people will probably disagree but I guess this is a fad! The wait was 2 hrs long  and the food was really good but nothing outstanding or heavenly ...and on top of it some of our party got extremely sick . So if your digestion is not the best or if you can't eat too much fat don't go there .  Other than that the service was ok people were fast and friendly to serve .
,,,,,"I thought I had reviewed after I visited Au Cheval but it's likely that I was too full to move, let alone type the glowing review that this place deserves. "
,,,,,"America and beyond, you've heard everyone important (and even the unimportant) tell you that this is the best burger ever. News flash, no one lied to you. It really is amazing. It's juicy but not greasy. The bread is perfect. There's no obnoxious sauce. It's just a basic bitch. BUT Miss Jackson if you nasty, you must get it with pork belly and egg to get the entire effect. If you heed my advise, you're going to need a wheelchair to roll you out of there especially after you have the 2nd star of Au Cheval's line up..."
,,,,,THE MOTHER FORKING BONE MARROW. HOLY SHIRT. 
,,,,,"It's fatty. It's greasy. But the flavor is like a stick of meat butter. Then, they give you this ridiculous beef cheek marmalade with it that is sweet and supple and ooey and gooey and it's just...heaven. And entirely worth the food coma that all of this rich food is going to put you in. "
,,,,,"Luckily at the time of my visit, Nosh and Booze was open next door and they provided Fernet to keep us from dying. Reason 736292 that I love Chicago. "
,,,,,"To sum up, yes, you're going to have to wait in line to get in. Suck it up. Give them your name and go fork around for an hour or whatever. It's Chicago, there are drinks everywhere. This is a place not to be missed in your culinary lifetime and even if you have a food baby after you leave, the satisfaction from your meal will keep you warm forever."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Always was told to check this place out from everyone who knew I was going to chicago. Glad I listened. Probably the best burger I've had. Seating was very limited, so expect a wait; or just download the app and check in that way. Once seated the atmosphere is cool (dimly lit with good music). Burger was what you'd expect; nothing crazy but not cheap either."
,,,,,I'll keep it simple and not pretend to be a food critic. This place serves some serious gourmet sh*t. Quit complaining and eat your damn burger.
,,,,,Pretty great burger and overall experience. People say its overhyped - but I think they definitely have a solid burger. Side note: didnt make reservations for a Friday night and took under 1 hour to be seated - walked the block and grabbed a beer next door (3 floyds on tap). 
,,,,,Burger: 8/10 - single is a double patty/double is a quadruple patty. Order accordingly. Very juicy and perfectly cooked. Bacon is extremely thick cut and amazing. Minimal toppings overall but I like burgers like this.
,,,,,"Wings: Amazing, 9/10. Liked it better than the wings itself. "
,,,,,Drinks: lots of unique cocktails.
,,,,,"Atmosphere: super loud, not a big fan. Service was somewhat slow."
,,,,,"We got 2 double cheeseburgers and one fries! The food was amazing! The cheeseburgers were so filling and flavorful. One of the best cheeseburgers I've ever had. All in all, a 4.75/5."
,,,,,I was really excited to dine here and heard great reviews but unfortunately my experience was not a good one. I ordered single cheeseburger and it fell short of my expectations. The burger was overseasoned & the flavors were just overwhelming. The rest of my food was okay. Also restaurant seemed understaffed.
,,,,,This burger. I didn't even know there could be this good of a burger. There was about a 50 minute wait and I'm so glad I decided to wait! Their pickles are amazing and the burger was just otherworldly. Fries were fine but not the star of the show. Go here!
,,,,,100% worth the hype. Every element of the burgers and appetizers was selected and presented to perfection.
,,,,,Still my favorite burger in my Chicago and a must-try for your out of town visitors! My go-to items are the cheeseburger and hash browns. 
,,,,, I want to give them five stars but I can't because of non-food related reasons.
,,,,,Best time to come is within the first hour of opening. Every time I've come to dinner was a 1.5-2 hour wait. 
,,,,,"Music is loud, seating is limited, no reservations, and you can't call them to ask about seating status."
,,,,,"Au Cheval has a reputation for having the best burger in Chicago so of course, we were delighted to give it a try. We ordered the food for pickup through the website directly. It appeared that caviar and door dash both charged more for every item on the menu. Also, I'm glad we checked our order before driving away because they forgot two order of fries."
,,,,,"I got the single and my husband got the single with bacon. We both ordered fries. My only complaint is that there are no dessert items on the menu. The burger is superb. It's filling and not greasy. The fries are well salted and delicious! The husband did mention that since his preferred bacon type is not as thick and crispy, next tine he'll skip the bacon but the burger itself was fantastic."
,,,,,"Au Cheval definitely lives up to the hype. I've tried going there a handful of times before, and was always scared off by the wait. "
,,,,,"Third time was the charm though, and we snagged a table for brunch on a Sunday morning. Our group was there at 11AM, and the place was still popping! Definitely speaks to the quality of the food and service."
,,,,,"Order the burger, it would be offensive not to. A single comes with two patties, and a double comes with three. I went the route of a single with cheese, a fried egg, and bacon. Figured that I had walked there so I earned it, right?"
,,,,,"Fries are crispy, well seasoned, and come with a fantastic garlic aioli. Keep in mind that fries don't come with the burger -- it's a side order. Granted the burger is so rich you're better off sharing the fries with the table so no biggie there."
,,,,,"Their brunch menu also features a ""breakfast beer"" section, which I think deserves a call out for obvious reasons. I'm excited to try out Small Cheval to see how it compares -- if you have the time to wait, definitely check it out, or shoot for some off hours for better luck."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Long overdue review, yet again. This will detail both of my visits to Au Cheval for both of my visits to Chicago. "
,,,,,"The main reason I saved this review for one of the later ones is because I knew I couldn't rush this process. This is one of those reviews that needs time, thought, commitment and proofreading to ensure that the appropriate credit was given. Thankful for my foodie aficionado of a friend who introduced me to this lovely gastropub, we made our way to Au Cheval with the knowledge that we would be seated 3+ hours later. So the deal here is that there are strictly no reservations allowed. You walk in, put down your name and you will receive a text when your table is ready for you. "
,,,,,"So with that, we had made reservations nearby at The Aviary for some pretty cocktails to really set the tone before we stuffed our faces. When we realized we still had time, we headed to Bad Hunter and indulged in some more cocktails and delicious appetizers before walking over to Au Cheval. One thing that's amazing about this area is that we walked to and from all these restaurants with ease. We were very happy."
,,,,,"So now, let's talk about the ambiance and the food. The place was packed. It was dark, intimate and trendy. We were promptly seated and the service was warm, welcoming and efficient. It was an eventful Saturday night and there were glasses clinking, people laughing and chattering and really good food cooking. Au Cheval is known for having one of the best burgers in the nation. Y'all already know we were in. "
,,,,,"SINGLE CHEESEBURGER 5/5: Holy cannoli. First of all, their single cheeseburger consists of two patties. I don't know, but I'm okay with that. The quality of the meat? Top-notch juicy prime beef. The cheese? Classic Kraft American slices perfectly melted atop the meat. In addition to that were two juicy, thick-cut pieces of sweet and savory peppered bacon underneath a beautifully-garnished, pillowy fried egg, topped with a delicious slaw of thinly-sliced pickles and chopped onions mixed with a lemony mayonnaise concoction. All slabbed together between two crispy soft burger buns. The dill pickle spear on the side was necessary too."
,,,,,"This burger is in all actuality pretty simple when it comes to ingredients, however the quality is what makes it stand out. Coming from a gal who'd never have her burgers  "
,,,,,"without lettuce, tomatoes and onions--much less someone who usually never eats bacon or fried egg on her burgers--I was blown away by this combination. The meat wasn't over or undercooked. The bacon pieces were perfect. The runny fried egg and pickle mix just complemented everything. "
,,,,,"Now because the burger was huge and we wanted to try other menu items, we split the burger and ordered fries as well as their famous honey-fried chicken. "
,,,,,"FRIES 4/5: Semi-thick. Crispy. Fantastic aioli on the side. Not the absolute best I've had, or maybe it's because I was so impressed by the burger that I didn't feel the need to compensate any taste with the side helping of fries? I don't know. I could do without."
,,,,,"GENERAL JANE'S HONEY FRIED CHICKEN 5/5: Yes. It's a must. I will warn you now, the chicken has more of a sweet and sticky coating around it rather than a bread crumb shell. Fried, then coated with honey goodness. Topped with chili, sesame seeds and cilantro. The chicken practically melted off the bone and there was no need or thought of any sauce to complete the taste. This was it and it was fantastic. The hot towels on the side added a thoughtful touch. "
,,,,,"When I returned for my second visit about 8 months ago, I repeated the same thing with my boyfriend so he could try a piece of this Heaven. We absolutely loved it. I hope to come back again and try other menu items here and be just as blown away as I was from these few dishes. "
,,,,,"Fun fact per Google: Au Cheval means ""on horseback"", but in France it also refers to food items on a menu being served with a ""fried egg on top"". The more you know. "
,,,,,PARKING
,,,,,"You may be lucky with some spots in this busy-yet-secluded area, but we took an Uber/Lyft."
,,,,,"I've lived in and around Chicago my whole life, and I'm ashamed it's taken me so long to get to Au Cheval! It's been on my list for a while now, but I guess I needed to come visit at a time I was mentally prepared for a wait :)."
,,,,,"One of my girlfriends and I came in on a Friday at around 5:30pm, and we were told there was a 3 and a half hour wait. We expected this, so we gave our cell phone number and decided to bar hop around West Loop. After about 3 hours and 15 minutes of drinking, we got a text saying our table was ready. We were pumped (and albeit, a little tipsy)."
,,,,,"When we were sat down, we decided to split a double burger with cheese, bacon and a side of fries. Alright, I'll admit we were pretty drunk by the time we were eating (I mean.. what else are we supposed to do for three and a half hours?), but everything was so. so GOOD! The burger just melted in your mouth, the fries were crispy and fresh and came with a fried egg on top. "
,,,,,"Overall, 100% worth the wait to eat at Au Cheval. Check it out for yourselves!"
,,,,,I haven't been amazed in a while when it comes down to burgers-- I'm very picky and I was blown away with it. 
,,,,,Here is the breakdown:
,,,,,Food
,,,,,There are a couple of things in the menu but go with the cheeseburger add bacon (amazing-- to die for) and sunny side up egg. They give a nice big patty so single patty it is fine. I enjoyed every bite of the burger and after eating it all I didn't fill that heaviness that I normally feel when I eat a burger. Truly enjoyed it.
,,,,,Decor/ ambiance 
,,,,,It is a nice casual restaurant with a casual chic feel to it. It is an open kitchen and it is always fun to see them prepare your meal right in front of you. 
,,,,,Tip
,,,,,"There is always a line. My friend and I first tried at 11:30pm and there was a 45 minutes wait. We decided to go the next day at around 5:30pm and there was a 2 hours wait. We decided to wait at the four seats at the bar-- first come, first serve. Waited 15 minutes and got a seat. "
,,,,,Service
,,,,,The lady taking our order was very sweet and friendly. Very attentive and doing her best to be present. 
,,,,,Overall
,,,,,Had a great time there and I would highly recommend to people.
,,,,,"Hands down the best burger I have had in this city. The quality of the meat was top notch and adding an egg and bacon is a MUST. The bacon was approximately a quarter of an inch thick and had a fantastic flavor. Additionally, the fries with the garlic aioli were great as well as the hash browns. "
,,,,,"I went to this place by myself around 5pm and the wait was 1 hour, but as I was leaving I overheard couples saying there wait was approximately four hours long! This place is in high demand, so be sure to plan accordingly because they don't accept reservations, it is a first come first serve basis."
,,,,,"I have been wanting to try Au Cheval for the longest time, and finally bit the bullet and waited an hour to get seated."
,,,,,"Despite being known for their burgers, the best-tasting dish I tried that night was the bone marrow. The portion was extremely hearty."
,,,,,"As for the burger, it was well-seasoned and cooked. If it weren't for the thick cut of the seasoned bacon, I do not think the burger would have been memorable. I don't know if it was the best burger I have ever had, or if I would wait that long to try it again, but I'm glad I had it, and I do think it is a competitive-tasting burger in Chicago. "
,,,,,"Apparently Au Cheval serves only 1 pork chop each night, so my friend and I decided to try it. It tasted as good as the smell and appearance of it made it out to be. The taste became a bit tiring given the size of it (and because it was more than enough for 2), but it made for good leftovers."
,,,,,All right. Here's the straight dope about Au Cheval.
,,,,,"Is it good? Yes. It's very good; it's consistently among the best burgers you can have on any given Tuesday at three in the afternoon. I like to hop on the Blue Line and contemplate ruining my diet as I pass their Wicker Park location, but I also enjoy Au Cheval's main digs."
,,,,,"And yes, I realize that the two locations are slightly different. I'm not some untutored rube, here. I know what I'm doing."
,,,,,"The Au Cheval burger is reliable, apart from its expense. At this time of writing, a single cheeseburger will run you just under $14. Au Cheval is the Restoration Hardware to your local burger joint's Ikea. Your particleboard furniture gets the job done, and it might even look good. But this is a beautiful work of art. It feels good to be in its proximity. Savor it."
,,,,,"But, you might be asking: Does Au Cheval offer the best burger in America, as has been repeatedly claimed by any number of critical sources, including but not limited to the Food Network, the Daily Meal, and countless independent blogs?"
,,,,,No.
,,,,,Sorry. But it's not.
,,,,,"Not by any means. The burger at Au Cheval is far from even being the best burger within the Chicago city limits. And the Chicago suburbs can hang, too. But that's a discussion for another time and another Yelp review."
,,,,,"But like I said -- and here I'm eager not to annoy any diehard Chevalians -- the burger at Au Cheval is still a very good work of culinary art and science. If given the choice between Kuma's and Au Cheval, I'd definitely go with the latter. "
,,,,,Now let's get into details.
,,,,,"The BUN is about as close to perfect as one can imagine. But it's also a very specific approach. It's not too bready, not too doughy. It is definitely not toasted in the traditional sense, and falls even below the scale of merely crisp. It's what would happen if you popped a piece of lightly buttered bread into an oven at 425 for just under a minute. C'est parfait!"
,,,,,"The PATTY is very good. But almost every time I visit Au Cheval, I find the beef too greasy. It's not slimy, but it doesn't have a great mouth feel, either. It doesn't feel granular or anything, the way cheap burgers do, but the patty is a little too soft for my liking."
,,,,,"The patty makes the CHEESE seem indistinct. It's your standard American cheese. But there's too much of it, and blends with the patty far too readily, in my opinion. When you bite into the Au Cheval burger, the bun gives way to this mass of indistinct animal product that, while very tasty in a certain way, could nevertheless use a bit more identity."
,,,,,"The PICKLES are an okay addition, but in my view you might as well just take them off. Too much information for the palate. And the pickles are a bit challenging after the massive wall of meat and cheese. Like, what is this extra thing I'm tasting, and why is it briny? Oh, right: Pickles."
,,,,,"I feel roughly the same way about the BACON on the Au Cheval burger. Why in the world does everything need bacon? Even doughnuts are being given the bacon treatment. We're surely in cultural decline, and the senseless proliferation of bacon is to blame. You heard it here first."
,,,,,"The MAYO is pretty ordinary, and there's entirely too much of it. Take a knife (or a spoon) and scrape some of it away. It's good for the fries, actually. But this place has plenty of good pairings for your fried potatoes, and I suggest that you try all of them. But good old fashioned mayo does pretty well, all the same."
,,,,,"So yeah, the Au Cheval burger is good. It's not the best burger in America. And it's not the best burger in Chicago. But it's very good. If you ask me if I want to go to Au Cheval, I'm going to say Yes."
,,,,,And I'll promise not to complain.
,,,,,I actually have to admit...it was probably the best burger that I had...
,,,,,"I wanted to try for a while, but was also scared of the long wait.  Since both my friend and I have never tried, we decided to come.  The wait was not that bad."
,,,,,"You can provide your phone number when you check in, and they'll text you when your seats are ready as others reported.  You can hang out in the bar section, or visit one of the bars in the neighborhood while waiting."
,,,,,"The burger was so flavorful and juicy...I had single with egg + bacon...I was full after I had a half, but still kept eating.  We shared fries and were good, but we were too full..."
,,,,,"I have to add the service was excellent as well.  My phone died all the sudden while waiting outside for Uber (to get here) due to the extreme low temperature, and my server was happy to recharge it for me while we were dining.  "
,,,,,I would definitely come back when I am in Chicago next time!
,,,,,One of the best burgers. Before covid the wait times were a little long on the weekend. But now you can order and pick up.
,,,,,This place is a must eat when visiting Chicago and is definitely worth the wait!  
,,,,,Decided to come here per a friend's recommendation. 
,,,,,There is an excellent craft beer selection.
,,,,,Came with a friend on a Friday afternoon and was seated in 20 minutes - not bad!
,,,,,We split a burger and fries. The thick cut bacon was to-die for! Like caramelized pork belly. Definitely in my top 5 burgers in Chicago.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"What can I say. Every once in a while it's worth it to wait an hour, or two for a burger. I'm usually near Small Cheval but it's nice to stop by the original. If you're near, take one to go too!! So dang good!!"
,,,,,"I wish, this place open a restaurant in southern California . I have tried, really good hamburger places past 20 years ."
,,,,,but Hamburger from this place was very impressive. 
,,,,,"I satisfied everything from here. Service , interior, drinks, restrooms and specially the foods. I already know, what I want to order from this place for my next trip to Chicago,"
,,,,,"Some people say this spot is overrated--do yourself a favor and don't listen to those people! It's certainly a popular spot and there's usually a waiting line but you can just drop your name and number and have them text you when you're ready to be seated.  The burgers are delicious but if you want something truly ridiculous (in flavor and richness that is!) get the roasted bone marrow.  My goodness!  Also, their cocktails are a must.  Great way to top off an excellent meal."
,,,,,Food was good but not worth the price. I get we are going through covid and I am all for supporting all local restaurants and everyone but no where on the menu does it talk about the extra covid charge. I will and don't mind paying it but do not like to be surprised. It isn't on there website or there scan code. People dining should have that option if they choose and know ahead. But food was ok. The foies gras/egg burger was not worth it and if you want a burger go to small cheval. We have gone to both places and I don't see the hype.
,,,,,"Worth the hype and completely worth the price for the burger but I wouldn't wait in line for it, catch them on the early weekdays, you'll get seated immediately"
,,,,,I. Loved. This. Place.
,,,,,So we came here Monday night which happened to be Memorial Day so we were just happy they were open. Au Cheval had been on my places to visit list for Chicago so I had done the research to know we were going to have to wait and that was completely fine with us so we put our names down and we were told it would be about an hour. There is enough to walk around and see and they text you when your table is ready and you can send a text to check your place in line. 
,,,,,"Once we got the text that our table was ready and we got back we were seated fairly quickly and given menus and water. The waitress was nice and got our drinks quickly and took our food order. 2 single burgers (which come with two patties) adding bacon to one, a side of fries, a root beer and a Pepsi."
,,,,,The burgers were soooo good. No need for lots of condiments or extra gimmicks that a lot of places add. There was definitely a lot of flavor there in our opinion. Fries were crispy and maybe we just weren't super hungry but one order was definitely enough for two people. Definitely one of the best burger places I've been to so far and I am a huge burger fan.
,,,,,I only wish I could have gotten a picture of the food but at night the lighting was way too dark and I didn't use flash but maybe that was a good thing. Now next time I head to Chicago I can head back during the day for some more burgers.
,,,,,"Great the best burger I've ever had highly recommended if you are visiting Chicago this is a must try everything about the burger was great full of flavor I visited while I was in from Houston,Tx I look forward on going back"
,,,,,"It's a pain to get in, but it's a must do! Limited menu because they do it all so well. Went with a girlfriend on a Friday afternoon at 2:00pm and only a 15-20 minutes wait- we struck gold! We were seated at the bar counter which was the perfect place to watch all of the action in the kitchen. Ordered a burger, bread and butter pickles and crispy fries. Everything was AMAZING. The burger is so large I am glad that I was able to share this beauty. Bread and butter pickles are the best I have ever had, and if you like pickles it's a must order. I've heard the wait can be up to 2 hours and there are lots of bars near by, if you can't sneak in during an off time put your name in, go drinking and come back because there is nowhere to stand and wait. Service is good, food is fantastic and I would go if I'm ever back in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Was tasty, but slightly overhyped. Bar Sienna has a much tastier and well rounded traditional Chicago burger, and service was far more memorable. Try Bar Sienna as well!"
,,,,,WOW Burgers as expected.  Great flavor and quality meat.  One of the best in the city.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Finally made it to this place, and was definitely worth the hype. We arrived just before 5:30 and waited only 40 minutes for an outdoor table. Burger was incredible, and I'm glad I had it with ham and an egg. Cocktails, fries, and pickleback shots were great additions :)"
,,,,,"6,000 reviews later, I don't think they really need another review from me, but here you go. :)"
,,,,,"It's a ridiculous experience to eat here... ridiculous in all the right ways. Arrive 3-4 hours ahead of when you want to eat, be ready within 10 minutes of them texting you, and prepare for a treat. "
,,,,,"The single cheeseburger (which is actually a double patty) with bacon and egg is insane. SO GOOD. Seriously salivating right now. The duck hash is phenomenal, the Korean style wings are crispy while still being drenched in sauce, and the garlic aioli for the fries. My god. This meal was one to remember. "
,,,,,"It's a shame the wait is so long because I would love to be a regular!! Can we sign a petition to make reservations a thing here?! Or at least ""join the waitlist"" on yelp from the comfort of my sofa?! PLEASE?!"
,,,,,"Until next time you glorious Au Cheval burger, you."
,,,,,PS- pink lemonade vodka cocktail is not to be missed.
,,,,,"The evening started out rough. To be told the wait for two people is an hour then to watch people walk in off the street and sit at the bar infuriated me. The host then says ""oh THOSE two seats are first come first serve."" Insulting and ridiculous. He had long hair pulled into a ponytail and I'll never give my money to a place that has tons of people standing in any corner possible to eat and no one offers the two empty seats. Pretty terrible on a cold snowy day. Just terrible."
,,,,,Luckily the food and the server was great. We sat at the bar and were able to watch the chefs cook which was amazing. Oh the chicken wings and the BURGER was to die for. 
,,,,,Thank you!
,,,,,"For years I have been hearing and reading that Au Cheval has the best burger in US.  I didn't have an opportunity to go until last night because of the exorbitant wait time.  It was a Saturday night with nothing to do so we took off early and got to the restaurant about 4:45.  When we arrived we were told it would be a 2.5 - 3 hour wait.  (I heard a party of eight provided a wait time of 4.5 hours.)  We were also asked if we would accept seats at the bar if they were available first.  Seats were at the bar were acceptable to us,  They took a cell number and we were on the list!  Whoo Hoo!  Love their list system.  They send you an initial text  that you can reply to in order to either remove yourself from the list or ask where you are on the list.  "
,,,,,"We decided to settle ourselves in at the Lone Wolf bar, just down the street."
,,,,,"Accepting the seats at the bar cut our wait time.  Good move!  Our was exactly two hours!  We were seated at the bar where we could watch the non -stop assembly line of burger, fries and eggs.  Those people never stop moving."
,,,,,"A waitress came very quickly to take our order.  We didn't order any drinks since we have plenty of time to scratch that itch while we were waiting.  Single burgers for both of us and an order of fries to share.  Keep in mind that at  Au Cheval a single is a double (two patties) and a double is a triple.  Our food came incredibly quickly!  They don't even wait for orders here, they just keep pumping out those burgers.  Fries arrives a couple of minutes after the burgers."
,,,,,So about the burgers....they are good but to say they are the best in the US or even the best I have ever had would be stretch.  I didn't get either the egg or the bacon added on; maybe that would raised the bar. 
,,,,,"Fries were very good and I really dig the garlic aioli that comes with.  I did think them a bit on the salty side though.  All in all, glad I tried it but probably wouldn't wait like that again for them."
,,,,,Value though is through the roof!!  Really reasonably priced!
,,,,,"Holy crap!  Amazing is something I'd never thought I'd say about a place like this.  My first attempt to come here last Summer as an out of towner on a busy weekend was them telling me it was going to be a 3-4 hour wait for dinner.   So unfortunately had to go somewhere else.   I recently came back to Chicago and was now really wanting to try it to see what the hype was all about.   Came on a Monday around 11:30 and we had to put our name on the list.  The wait was about an hour so we walked across the street the the Haymarket to grab a quick beer.   Finally got called and the inside is a decent size but not huge, which is part of the reason for the super long wait.   "
,,,,,"Started out with the bloody mary and it is decked out with bread and butter style pickles and garnish which is a little sweeter, but pickles were tasty.   The bloody mary was pretty good however, I like mine spicy.  This one was not but that's ok, still enjoyable.  "
,,,,,"Next up came our order of crispy fries with mornay sauce, garlic aioli and fried egg.   The mornay sauce is kinda like a gruyere style cheese sauce and was friggin' tasty and so was the garlic aioli.  Strong garlic flavors that were super good.  Broke up the egg and and dumped the cheese sauce all over and it is top notch.   "
,,,,,"And then lastly, I opted for the double cheese burger with the added egg and thick cut bacon.   Ok, here was my mistake, I should have gotten the single cause a single comes with two meat patties and a double comes with three.   I was struggling to try to eat all this delicious food.   with the egg,  the burger was a little messy but not as messy as other places I've been to are.   The brioche bun holds up well enough to handle all the goodness without falling apart.  The flavors are something I don't even know how to describe that makes this burger so dang good and the hype was lived up to.   I've watched videos of how to make this burger and they're look like absolute dookie compared to what you get here.   Apparently their secret sauce is a dijonnaise, heck might even be the American cheese.  The food felt rich enough to keep me full for pretty much the entire day.   "
,,,,,"If you are a foodie, this is a place worth checking out!"
,,,,,How have I never written a review for Au Cheval.
,,,,,"I was first introduced to Au Cheval several years ago after attending a beer event with some friends.  I was warned that there may be a wait to get seated, but that the wait would be worth it.  Now, while there was a wait, it wasn't as long as anyone expected, but it was well worth it.  "
,,,,,"Firstly, because they have a really solid beer selection to choose from while you wait.  So while we enjoy a few beers and decided on what we were going to order, the time just seemed to fly by."
,,,,,"Once we were seated, that's where the real enjoyment began.  The food is outstanding.  Burgers unlike many of the places in Chicago.  Juicy, flavorful and filling.  Plus, you can add bacon to the burger.  If you do not add bacon to your burger, I question your life choices because that bacon will in fact change your life.  It adds another level to the burger like any I have seen before."
,,,,,I haven't even mentioned the fries.  Something about those fries is addicting.  The sauce that comes with them is also worth noting because it is better then anything you could dip a fry into.  Be sure to order a side of fries when you are there!
,,,,,"In closing, it is worth checking out at least once, because you will be sure to come back again and again."
,,,,,"Au Cheval is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, but I 'm just now getting around to reviewing it. The short review is that it's fantastic!"
,,,,,"Every time I go there, it follows a pretty similar script. My wife and I walk in, give our name (they don't take reservations), and are told that there will be a wait (typically around an hour to an hour and a half). I give my phone number and we have drinks at a nearby bar. When our table is 10 minutes from being ready, they text saying to start heading over. That may seem like a long wait, but the service is fast once you're in Au Cheval, so it's really not so bad."
,,,,,There are some good cocktails and generally a solid selection of beers. Our order is taken shortly after being seated and my wife and I always get burgers and share an order of fries. The fries typically come first - they are crispy and delicious. We're only able to have a couple each when the burgers are set in front of us and we dive into those. We're always members of the clean plate club.
,,,,,I was SO SO excited to eat here because I heard fantastic things about this place. We ordered three burgers- 2 with egg and 1 with both egg and bacon. The burger itself was really salty and so were the fries. I would recommend trying the burgers if you're in the area but don't order the fries. The bone marrow was salty too but the jam that came with it was SO good.
,,,,,Incredible burger...Of course they're known for it. Great service during COVID. The bone marrow was liquid from heaven but might've been excessive in quantity (3 pieces) so we unfortunately couldn't finish it. A must if you're in town or in NY!
,,,,,About a 1 hour wait on a Friday morning getting there right at opening 
,,,,,But you can put your name down and then go grab and drink or walk around elsewhere

,,,,,"With all the hype surrounding this restaurant, I imagined biting into the juiciest, tastiest burger in town while egg yolk ran down my hand. Did this happen? Almost."
,,,,,"The best part of Au Cheval is the Burger. Super juicy, extremely tasty and full of flavor. Accompanied by crispy and crunchy fries. We ordered the single cheeseburger (which is two patties), with tomato and lettuce. We opted to not get the thick cut of maple bacon that everyone raves about because we wanted to really try the flavor of the burger without any bells and whistles (okay, we're also not big bacon people). The burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had - it was cooked darn near perfect."
,,,,,"We also ordered the fried bologna sandwich, after the bartender gave us a raving review of it. We ordered it well done so the bologna would be extra crispy. It's the best, they said. Even better than the burger, they said. You won't regret it, they said. Well, I didn't regret it but it wasn't a big deal. It was good, but your stomach space is better off being filled with a burger. The bologna was a little on the salty side and honestly nothing to write home about."
,,,,,"Now the wait. The wait is HORRENDOUS. Granted, we did come on a cold and windy (37F and rainy) Saturday night at 5:35pm. The wait was 5-6 hours. There were 86 parties ahead of us. Yeah..."
,,,,,"There are 4 seats at the bar that are first come first serve (you wait and wait and wait until someone at the bar finished their meal and then you swoop in and take their seat). We ended up trying that option out, and got seated after about an hour wait (much better than 5 hours). I would recommend you sit at the bar if you really want to try the burger but not the wait."
,,,,,"Overall, I hyped myself up too much for this place and was let down. I would recommend sticking to the cheeseburger and coming right when they open. With plenty of delicious restaurants in Chicago, once at this burger joint was enough."
,,,,,Honestly worth the 3+ hour wait. 
,,,,,"This was my first beef burger (I'd only ever had turkey burgers before), and I was really impressed. Ordered a single hamburger (which is actually 2 patties) with an egg. Burger came out. It's simple, but that's all you need. The buns were perfectly oiled and toasted, and the egg was. seasoned amazingly. Obviously I don't have a lot of knowledge on burgers, considering this was my first one, but it was really quite delicious. The seasoning was great. It was filling, but I managed to finish it. "
,,,,,My friends RAVE about the bacon here. It's like 3 inches thick and looks incredible. Definitely going to try it next time I'm here!!!
,,,,,Always hits the spot! Loved the outdoor dining experience during COVID and the first restaurant I ate at that asked you to constantly put your mask back on! Really good
,,,,,Of course got a single cheeseburger with egg & bacon
,,,,,Always fantastic
,,,,,"Bone marrow was PHENOMENAL!!! Loved it so much. Our bones were huge, 4 buttered toasts and the marmalade was a good combination of sweet and spicy "
,,,,,Took the bone marrow bones home 
,,,,,Old fashions were strong here 
,,,,,Service and staff was unlike any other restaurant 
,,,,,Seriously such great waiters who really enjoy working here
,,,,,Hands down one of the best burger points in Chicago.  It does get busy during rush hour.  So expect some wait and I do promise it's worth it.  Service was awesome!  The ambience is inviting to hang out.  There is a good selection of food and drinks to try.  I highly recommend the single cheeseburger that comes with a sunny side up egg and a huge side pickle.  The beef patty was juicy and cooked perfectly to my liking.  You can also get a sunny side up egg over fries on the side.  The aioli sauce that comes with the fries is so delicious.  The fries is a good order to share among the table.
,,,,,I was so excited to eat here and it certainly did not disappoint. 3 of us came in shortly after opening on a Tuesday and only waited about 10 minutes! 
,,,,,"There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try but it felt wrong to order something other than a burger on my first visit so I ordered the single cheeseburger with bacon and egg added on, a side of fries, and an old fashioned. I was confused at first when my burger came because it had two patties on it but we figured out that was just their style. The burger was juicy and perfectly seasoned with a beautifully melted slice of cheese on top. The bacon was nice and thick (I don't normally like thick cut bacon but I loved theirs) and the egg was perfectly cooked, not too runny but not too hard. There were some finely sliced pickles on the burger that added a subtle sweetness to the burger as well (it also comes with a quarter of a pickle. The other 2 ordered a single with bacon and the fried bologna sandwich, which they both really enjoyed as well. "
,,,,,"The service was great, attentive but not overbearing. Our server asked if anyone at the table had food allergies which we really appreciated since someone in our group did have specific dietary needs. I can't wait to come back and try the other menu items!"
,,,,,"Five stars every time. I feel like I've been getting these burgers for five years and they are exactly the same as when they started. Perfect! Other burgers here in Chicago are amazing as well but Au Cheval consistently stays around the top spot. The fries and aïoli are amazing, as well as the bologna sandwich. But do yourself a favor and save it all for that amazing burger, thick cut bacon and the egg. The combination literally just blows your mind. "

,,,,,"Best burger on Earth.  No seriously thick cut bacon on those amazing patties will send you to the moon.  It's insane.  Chicago, we know food."
,,,,,The burgers here are legendary but don't overlook the wings and the matzah ball soup which are equally delicious. Went pre lockdown and yes you have to allow for a good hour waiting time but it is delicious. Good late night spot or even a date spot. I like sitting at the bar and watching the chefs.
,,,,,Consistently great although for the first time the bacon on my burger was almost all fat which was disappointing considering its an extra 5 dollars. Still a good burger after I took the bacon off
,,,,,How does this place have so many 5-star reviews?!? Because it's incredible! Holy shit. Totally lived up to the hype!
,,,,,"Leaving another 5 star review for Au Cheval, not that this gem needs any more to know how great it is. Reliably fantastic burgers each time I've visited, and fries with garlic aioli are great to share with the table. I can't say I've tried anything else on the menu, but the burger is so good that you don't really need to. So go ahead and put your name on the list and grab a drink nearby until you're next--it's worth the wait!"

,,,,,I didn't think I'd be able to get a seat here so soon! 
,,,,,"On my first try, I was quoted a 3-hr wait, which to my dismay, ended up being pretty accurate. They have a cool text-notification system that tells you how many parties are ahead in line. Mine started with 57, and as I checked every 20 mins like a maniac, the number went down by about 6-7 parties each time... my table ended up being ready a bit over 3hrs later, after I had practically already digested my back-up dinner plan. "
,,,,,"My most recent visit, however, was more fortunate. After being quoted 45mins (pretty reasonable by Au Cheval standards), I was notified of an open spot only 20 mins later! (Which led me to chug an entire latte from a coffee shop nearby and run over)"
,,,,,"The burger was everything I imagined it would be. Although the patties are thinner than most fancy burgers, the beef was soft and cooked to a perfect medium. The garnishes were not mind-blowing, but the toasted brioche bun was wonderful and held itself together all the way to the end. I had added both the runny egg and bacon, which was not too salty and was more like pork belly. Next time, I would probably forego one or the other (maybe the bacon because it was very greasy), especially since the portion is pretty huge (I definitely did not have room for any sides). "
,,,,,"Overall, the staff is nice and the food is good. It's definitely a ""fancier"" diner and, I think, a must-try in Chicago if you can get in."
,,,,,"So happy to hear that they're finally opened back up!! Be expected to long wait times, they don't take reservations. Their burgers are phenomenal and you must get the thick bacon added onto it!"
,,,,,Top 3 burgers in the world. If you do nit order the chicken wings you are doing yourself a disservice.
,,,,,"SO FREAKIN' GOOD. If you're looking for a legit burger spot in Chicago, look no further than Au Cheval! I've been hearing rave reviews from my Chicago coworkers about Au Cheval for a while now, and finally had the opportunity to go. They were busy at 6pm on a Monday night, and it was about a 45 minute wait for a table for a party of 2. We would have been seated faster if we opted for the bar, but the booth seemed much more comfortable and worth the wait. It's nice that they write down your number and text you when your table is almost ready, so we were able to hang out at the bar across the street beforehand. The waiting area at Au Cheval is pretty limited, and you have to stand the entire time. However, the cocktail and beer menu at Au Cheval is quite extensive, and definitely worth having a drink/some drinks here. I ended up trying:"
,,,,,"-Green Salad ($7.95): I felt like I needed something green with all the meat, and this was a huge salad. They add some herbs, like tarragon, which I didn't like, but it was solid otherwise. However, I would recommend skipping this since their other items are so good."
,,,,,"-General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken ($18.95, "
,,,,,"): Super crispy & flavorful- a must order! The sauce is very aggressively flavored, with some spice and tang. I loved how crispy the fried chicken was, and they give you a huge order."
,,,,,"-Single Cheeseburger ($12.95 + $1.95 Fried Egg + $4.95 Bacon, "
,,,,,"): Another must order, especially with the peppered bacon! The burger was cooked perfectly, and super flavorful and juicy. The bacon was awesome, with a slight sweetness, pepper, and some fat. My mouth is watering as I type this. "
,,,,,"-Side of Fries (Served w/Garlic Aioli, $6.95, "
,,,,,"): Very good version of steak fries, and they were super crispy on the outside but still tender on the inside. The garlic aioli was also really good."
,,,,,"-Mille-Feuille (Whipped Vanilla Cream, $12): Yum- the layers were super flaky, and the vanilla cream was thick and rich without being too sweet. "
,,,,,"Service was solid. Their staff is really friendly, but it took us a while to find our server to add a side of fries, order dessert, and grab our check since they are busy running around. There were so many other items I wanted to try (foie gras, scrambled eggs and toast dish, hash browns, porterhouse), so I'll definitely have to come back when back in Chicago. Parking in this area can be tough, but there is street parking available."
,,,,,(tourist review)
,,,,,"What's Good: Cheeseburger is top notch, one of the best we've ever had. The additional Egg and Bacon is a must. With French Fries on the side (comes with Mornay sauce), it's a recipe for a sluggish afternoon. If you're extra hungry, then the Foie Gras, with scrambled eggs and toast, is delicious. "
,,,,,"Other Notes: it's located in West Loop which is a little away from central downtown area, but well worth a trip for a meal in this area. To shake off the food coma, take a walk to Sawada Coffee - chill and creative Japanese coffee spot. Other notable places to eat nearby are Girl and the Goat (just across the street) and McDonald's headquarter where you can order from a global menu (about half a mile down)."
,,,,,"I don't want to say this is the best cheeseburger ever. But it is, I got the double with cheese. The grease isn't horrible and the bun is amazing."
,,,,,I ordered an IPA and everything about this place is perfect. 
,,,,,"A good friend recommend this place, go early! We got there around 11:30 and there was a 20 minute wait. When we left it looked like a crazy line."
,,,,,"Trust me, you have to try this burger. Go double with the bacon and cheese. It is so frickin; good."
,,,,,"A must-go place while visiting Chicago. Hands down one of the best burgers I've had traveling around. The price of a burger was a little high, but given what you get and the experience it was worth it. I had the Single Stack Burger, and the bacon they used was thick and juicy uncommon from other burger places I've gone to. The wait staff were extremely friendly and gave us pointers of places to visit while visiting Chicago. Definitely will stop back when I'm in the area again."
,,,,,Waited 1.5 hours to be seated on Saturday afternoon.   Staff was very friendly. Ordered a single cheeseburger with fries + egg - the cheeseburger was extremely salty. I only ate half of the hamburger because of the high sodium. Do not recommend.
,,,,,Chile!! Fire.
,,,,, 
,,,,,Went for lunch (party of 4) and was able to get a table IMMEDIATELY. Got there a few minutes before noon. We didn't just eat lunch here. We ATE lunch here!!!  We ordered tons of items on the menu to sort of taste test it all.
,,,,,Scores on a scale of 1-5 stars - Overall 5 star experience and happy I didn't go back to work sleeping at my desk.
,,,,,"Sweet Pickles - ain't my thang, prefer dill 1 star"
,,,,,"Fries with aioli - 10 stars cooked to a perfect crisp, a lil tang to the aioli"
,,,,,Cheeseburger - 5 stars so good but could use a little seasoning 
,,,,,Cheeseburger with bacon - 10 stars from the crew (I didn't partake in the pork)
,,,,,"Cheeseburger with egg - 5 stars same deal, good and great even but needs a bit of seasoning"
,,,,,Hashbrowns - 1 star too greasy no flavor 
,,,,,General Jane's Honey Fried Chicken - THIS WAS THE BEST CHICKEN I'VE HAD ALL YEAR. 20 Stars. I would highly recommend you get this goodness and use the leftover sauce on your burger. 
,,,,,I felt like I was missing a food group but it's a diner! No vegetables there except a few fatty salads. 
,,,,,"I would suggest being able to drink a bit of wine or a nice beer/cider with the rich, greasy dishes. "
,,,,,The root beer was apparently delicious. Everyone ordered it but me!
,,,,,"Had to try one of ""the best burgers in the country"" on our trip. Checked them out right when they opened on Monday morning and didn't have to wait (however, I heard you usually do). Decided to go all out by adding both the bacon and fried egg. The burger was delicious, as expected, but wasn't overly fond of how sweet the bacon was. Definitely consider this place a ""must try"" if you're visiting the city."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Yes. The wait is super long. Yes. They clear the tables fairly slow. Yes. It's so worth the wait. Sorta, lol? "
,,,,,"I don't know what else to really tell you. Just get the freaking burger as is. Oh, but if for some reason you decide to get greedy and add a ""double patty....,"" just know that that means three patties. Yup, their ""normal"" is already a double. I have a-la-carte-enthusiast friends who are always eating with their eyes.  "
,,,,,"If you're one of those Todd Jones type of guys who must pair fries with burgers, stop crying and get the fries. If not, meh... the fries were okay. I know how to cook a sunny-side-up egg. What's new? "
,,,,,"Do get the Jane chicken! Yow, the flavoring."
,,,,,Au Cheval was one of my favorite restaurants that we visited while in Chicago! Everything about this restaurant was such a cool experience. 
,,,,,"General jane's honey-fried chicken with chili, sesame seeds & cilantro: this was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Perfectly crispy skin and tender and juicy on the inside. It had just the right amount of spicy and sweet."
,,,,,"Single cheeseburger: I added an egg because well, everything tastes better with an egg on it. Everything about the burger was amazing and delicious."
,,,,,Rootbeer: which I believe they said was made in house or was locally brought in. Definitely a must have!
,,,,,Truly the best burger I ever had. My friends who took me here said every person they brought to try out this burger was not disappointed at all. It was worth the 3-4 hour wait on a Saturday night at 7PM. 
,,,,,"The single cheese burger itself is $12.95 but you must add an egg and bacon which ends up being ~$18 before tax and tip. Everything is just perfect. The egg is cooked over easy, the 3 thick slabs of bacon I heard is baked and grilled so it's cripsy on the outside but still juicy inside. The bacon also tasted a little like coffee, but delicious. "
,,,,,"A single cheese burger is definitely enough food for 1 person. A lot of people try to get the double but unless you can eat a lot in one sitting, get the single cheese burger with an egg and bacon. You won't regret it. I will definitely try to come here every chance I get when I come visit Chicago."
,,,,,I was told many people say this place has the best burger in the country. This is what drew me here. I was a skeptic; now I'm buying it.
,,,,,"One of the best burgers I've had for sure. Today was my 2nd time here - don't make the mistake of not ordering the bacon to add to your burger, even though it's +$4.95. It is well worth it. Also, anything with a gooey egg on top is instantly better than anything without it. If you are a fan of gooey eggs, this is your place. "
,,,,,"Also, don't underestimate the bologna sandwich. My family and I split this in 4 sections because we had already ordered the burgers individually. I would say the bologna sandwich had even more of a wow factor upon the first bite than the burger."
,,,,,"Note: they don't take reservations, and expect to wait even during off-peak hours. I went by myself the 2nd time around 2:00 pm and still had to wait about 10 minutes."
,,,,,"I don't see what all the hype is about it's an average burger with overpriced fries. Beer and cocktails on point. Fast service, guess they want you in and out! "
,,,,,Definitely not interested in coming back!
,,,,,"My new policy when traveling is high end hotels, and casual restaurants. When I arrived in Chicago I was in the mood for a burger. The concierge at our hotel recommended Au Cheval, so we gave it a try. It was too cold for outdoor dining so we took our order to go. If you are in need of a burger, and you are not on a diet, then you must try Au Cheval. Their burger is one of the tastiest, and juiciest burgers ever. Their chicken wings were tasty also. I will return when the weather is warmer and dine outdoors."
,,,,,This unassuming diner in the West Loop arguably serves the best burger in Chicago. When I heard about it for the first time I had to give it a try on my next visit in Chicago. 
,,,,,"Overall, the burger met the hype and this definitely one of the better hamburgers I have had in long time. They get really busy and you can expect to wait up to two hours for a seat. Best to come at off peak hours for a table."
,,,,,Food: 4.5 stars
,,,,,Service/environment: 4.25 stars
,,,,,Value: 4.75 stars
,,,,,Overall: 4.5 stars
,,,,,Recommendations: single burger with an egg
,,,,,The hamburger comes with a choice of single or a double and your choice of adding bacon and/or an egg. Given how popular this place is I was surprised  to see that the single burger was only about 13 USD. I went for an early lunch so I skipped the bacon and added the egg. 
,,,,,The single comes with two four oz patties which allows for maximizing the caramelization of the meat
,,,,,by having the four sides of the patties cooked on the cooktop. The bun is slightly toasted on the 
,,,,,cooktop and had a slight crunch with a tad bit of sweetness from the bread. The sauce they use tastes a bit like ranch but is definitely not as thick and heavy. I would definitely recommend the egg. The egg I believe is a duck egg as it is a lot smaller than a chicken egg and is cooked using special pan. 
,,,,,.
,,,,,"Probably the best cheeseburger I've ever had. We had to fit this in before our flight back to Canada and the staff was so accommodating with our luggages, storing them while we dined. There's no reservations but for a Monday, we got there around 2:45pm and got seated around 4pm. They give a 10min period for you to check back or they move another table up ahead of you. Before ordering, please note:"
,,,,,Single: two patties 
,,,,,Double: three patties 
,,,,,"Our group of six ordered two omelettes and the rest ordered single cheeseburgers (with egg and bacon). Got some bread pickles, hashbrowns, salad and bone marrow to compliment the meal. Everything was delicious."
,,,,,Truly an amazing burger! The wait can be awhile but it's definitely worth it. I always tell my out of town friends that this is the one place they need to experience.
,,,,,The burger is big and tastes very good. Meat is juicy. Loved the bacon and egg in my burger!
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Second time visiting Chicago and second time at Au Cheval... we had to go back. Actually second time was takeout to our hotel room because of COVID restrictions... but just as enjoyable... food is amazing. The duck heart hash is a must...
,,,,,Best burger I have ever eaten! Easy to see why there is so much appeal around this spot and such long lines.
,,,,,I came at 3PM to avoid most of the lines and got in without much of a wait by sitting at the bar.
,,,,,I got the standard burger with an egg and bacon along with a pint and it was fantastic. They make two thin burgers and put the cheese in between and on top along with 1/3 inch thick bacon slices cooked to perfection with a sunny side up egg on the top piece of the bun (which was also toasted and delicious!)
,,,,,I also got the fries which were good but nothing special. I did like how fresh they were and also that they weren't especially greasy but they weren't salted much and I'm definitely a salty food guy. The horseradish aioli that came with was very tasty and I used a decent bit with the fries.
,,,,,"Absolutely 5/5, amazing, A+ rating. I was blown away by how great this restaurant is. The food was delicious. I tried the bone marrow, cheeseburger, bologna sandwich, bacon and garlic fries and each dish was truly worthy of a 5 star rating on its own. Even better was the fact that the prices are quite cheap, considering that the  food quality is what you could get at a fancy suit-and-tie restaurant. The drinks are good, they have a wide selection of alcohol and also have their own root beer! The service from the staff was great. The only downside to eating here is that the dining area is a very loud environment, with music playing from speakers located all over the ceiling. It is also a very dark and dimly lit interior."
,,,,,"Been waiting to go here for years! I'm a huge burger fan.  The burgers looked good but very thin patties, a bit  over cooked for medium and not much for taste.   My wife joked about the similarity to wendy's burger and she was not far off.   the egg fries were the best part of the meal.  Also it was extremely over priced for the food and the drinks (that were all ice and 1/2 full)"
,,,,,"I'm giving this place four, not five, stars because the food was delicious, but nothing about Au Cheval wowed me. But this place is solid, don't get me wrong, wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars. We got a Double Cheeseburger with egg and the Crispy Fries Garlic Aioli and Fried Farm Egg. Both were delicious! The cheeseburger was well cooked and super tasty, and the fries were delicious too. The aioli was spot on. My friend also got a coke float (root beer float but with coke) and enjoyed it. Another friend got a cocktail but said it wasn't very alcoholic..."
,,,,,"FYI the double cheeseburger is 12oz if patty and the single cheeseburger is 8oz. The wait on Thursday midnight was 15 minutes, and there were even more people waiting after us! What a popular spot!"
,,,,,"Wow! Just Wow! The food is definitely backing up all the hype!  Yes, it is annoying that they do not take reservations... yes, the place is small... but if you can maneuver around those two ""obstacles"" and come during off peak hours - you will experience a win-win!  "
,,,,,"We arrived just after the lunch rush, and the wait for a table was 30+ min.... BUT the two adjoining seats at the bar happened to be open and the hostess cheerfully offered them to us, which we immediately and gladly took. So... we were seated within 30sec of walking in - awesome! The server was right there and took our drinks order. "
,,,,,"Side note: when I'm out I indulge in some Diet Cola, and I absolutely hate when restaurants offer the little glass bottles. NO, IT IS NOT FANCY - IT IS A RIPOFF!!!  It is the 21st century - get a bloody dispenser and serve your soft drinks like every other normal place! But I digress! ;). Au Cheval served the Diet Coke from a can, but it was free refills - which was just perfect!  "
,,,,,"Back to our awesome meal! We ordered their famous cheeseburger with bacon and egg, along with an order of fries with garlic aioli, and just because we were a bit hungry, we also ordered a half portion of the General Jane's chicken.  Let me just tell you, we (two adults) split that magnificent cheeseburger and fries, and trust me we were pretty full!  The chicken was absolutely great, but unfortunately, was completely overshadowed by the awesome cheeseburger (so sorry General Jane!)"
,,,,,"Bottom line - DEFINITELY RECOMMEND going to Au Cheval, just come before or after the rush! We certainly will in the future!"
,,,,,"It was everything that all the reviews say it is, the most delicious and flavorful burgers and fries. It was mind blowing and delicious."
,,,,,I can't even put into words what my taste buds just went through. 
,,,,,Literally. The. Best. Burger. 
,,,,,"I don't care how you eat your burger, how you eat your eggs, how you eat your bacon. Get it all. Together. * A single equals two patties by the way.. ;)"
,,,,,I would eat here until my arteries failed me. This place is so flavorful. 
,,,,,"On top of the delectable burger, the drinks were phenomenal. Ordered the horses neck which was ginger and lemon all in one. A perfect pair. "
,,,,,"Our server, JORDAN, was beyond the best. We chatted, he made suggestions, and thanked us for dining, topped with an amazing dessert. Again, words cannot describe the food that comes from this outstanding restaurant. "
,,,,,"I will dream about this until I can eat here again. Thank you, Au Cheval."
,,,,,"I can't think of many things as Chicagoan as the fried bologna sandwich from Au Cheval. It had been a hot minute since I ate one of these amazing sandwiches. I finally got my hands on one today and once again my life has meaning again! Just joking, but it was seriously so good."
,,,,,Very good food and reasonable prices. 
,,,,,We left with a bit of a letdown -- perhaps due to all of the hype and our seating near the bathroom area. 
,,,,,We went on a busy Saturday mid-afternoon. Other days and times might prove to be more ideal for some.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Hipsters be like: 'Me see expensive French-named restaurant selling gourmet egg-burger with Kraft cheese? That's it! Me gonna wait three hours!' 
,,,,,Almost 5 stars with 6000 reviews!? Call it what you will. I call it confirmation bias.
,,,,,"Follow the herd if you want, but it's absolutely nowhere near Kuma Corner on Belmont quality. And honestly, if you don't wanna wait at all, just go to Charlie Beinlich's in Northbrook, Illinois. "
,,,,,"The thing that gets me -- you're paying for supposedly high-quality meat, egg and honestly a very good bacon-cured pork belly garnish, but for whatever insane reason, the chef believes in nuking the taste with 'Kraft American cheese.' "
,,,,,"Let me tell you something: Kraft American Cheese -- it's the lowest common denominator in the cheese world. It's sacrilegious as an additive to gourmet burger. It's not bold or daring. It's not revolutionary. It's not subversive. It's idiotic. And the chef shouldn't be lauded for his experimentation, he should be boo'd.But he apparently brags as if his customers should be awed by such a monstrous creation. And you fell for it, sir/ma'am!"
,,,,,"It's like going to a really nice high-end stake house, ordering an eighty-five dollar steak, and then ordering it well-done and asking for ketchup. Don't do it, ya dummy!'"
,,,,,I'm telling you -- it ain't worth the wait.
,,,,,Soooooo good. Looked forward to this burger for a week and it def lived up to the hype! MUST get the burger with egg. Great bathroom :)
,,,,,"What impressed me most about this place was the good service amidst a very busy Sunday Brunch. Dining alone, I was sat at the bar, and I had a great time watching the organized kitchen staff and bartender. They had a lot of work, but executed the job with little stress. My server was attentive and helpful with beer suggestions. "
,,,,,"Was the burger the best I've ever had, no. Honestly it was a little disappointing. Very salty on a bottom bun that was over cooked. The top bun was better, but needed more condiments out to the edge. There was a lot of dry bun to get through, so I took most of it off. My favorite dish was the fries with fried egg and two sauces. So delicious. Would I wait for 2 hours for what I ate? No. I was alone so 30 minutes was a good wait for the food value and taste. $38 plus tip for burger, fries and beer."
,,,,,"Initially, we tried coming here on a Wednesday afternoon and there was an hour wait. So we came back at opening on Thursday morning and were seated immediately. There were still quite a few people at that time, which was surprising since it's 10 am. The inside isn't very big in terms of seating, there are a lot of booths and a bar in the middle, so that makes sense why the wait can be so long. Our waitress was nice and prompt, brought menus and water right away. "
,,,,,"We started with the bone marrow dish was really good. The bone marrow itself was rich and decadent, it came with a sauce that was also a flavorful addition and helped cut some of the fat of the marrow. The bread was so good, so buttery. The fries were crispy and warm, they came with an aioli dipping sauce that was good. The cheeseburgers were the obvious standout of the meal, they were really good. We shared, the single cheeseburger with an egg, it was cooked medium and even thought it says single it came with two patties. We also had the single cheeseburger with bacon, the bacon was thick cut and flavorful. Overall, I didn't feel overly full after eating half of a burger."
,,,,,"First time here and have heard about all the hype regarding this restaurant from locals. When we arrived, the venue was packed and there was a 45 minute wait. They put your name down and then follow up with a text. We were contacted to arrive within 10 minutes and were then seated. "
,,,,,"We ordered a cesar salad (crisps on side) and bone marrow as an appetizer, which worked out for us, a group of 4. We are on keto and can only do select meals that are low carb, which brought us to ordering lettuce bun burgers, but little did we know that a single burger was actually two patties and a double is three patties! We also added on the pickles, egg, and bacon, which was perfect. For drinks, we went with the Hemingway daiquiris, which were incredible."
,,,,,"This is definitely one of the best burgers I've ever ever had and the taste was absolutely amazing. Cost wise you're getting a great meal, but expect to pay $50+ for two if you're ordering drinks. Nonetheless, it is all entirely worth it and I cannot wait to return."
,,,,,"This truly is the absolute best burger in Chicago! The burger itself is so tender and melts in your mouth. The garlic aioli with the fries is to die for! Whenever I have guests visiting from out of town, I always make sure to take them here."
,,,,,The hype is real!
,,,,,But so is the wait.
,,,,,"We read on yelp about how the wait can be 3 hours. We got there on a Wednesday night around 7 or 8, and sure enough, we were quoted a 3 hour wait. (It was July 3rd.) My group of 3 decided to go to Skydeck while we waited, and when we got back, we waited for almost another hour. Basically, prepare to wait..."
,,,,,"Once seated, it was very loud inside. And dark! Not great for photos. ;) Our entire table got the same thing - single cheeseburger with the added egg and bacon. We wanted to try at least one other dish, so we opted for the crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy. It was so good! I wish we had shared a burger to try more food! Maybe another time!"
,,,,,"The burger lived up to the hype! It was so freaking good. The best burger I've ever had. And even though it's a single cheeseburger, it actually comes with 2 patties. I would highly recommend splitting the burger with someone so you can try a second menu option."
,,,,,"The service was friendly, but no one ever checked on us after we got our food. And it was worth the wait to finally see what the fuss was about. But I would not wait almost 3 hours again. (I think it was roughly 2.5 hours that we waited.) Apparently if you come right before opening, you have a better chance of being seated sooner. They do put your name and number down, so they can text you when a table is ready. That makes the wait a bit more convenient. Overall, the meal was great, but so was the wait!"
,,,,,"Yes, worth the hype. I won't take up any more space here because that's really all you need to know."
,,,,,"Writing an update. Au Cheval is great, the waits not so much. I've only ever come in on an off day after 1030 or so - every time I show up between 8 or 9, the wait is 2+ hours. Food alone I would give it 5 stars. "
,,,,,"Once seated, the food is great. The burger is everything - beefy, cheesy, rich, filling, and over the top if you add the thick cut bacon. I had the bone marrow this past visit as well, which was amazing. Perfect richness and when paired with the blueberry sauce on the fluffy toast it is an awesome bite."
,,,,,Good. 
,,,,,Best burger in America? No way.
,,,,,Best burger in Chicago? No idea. 
,,,,,Worth waiting for? Maybe 20-30 minutes max.
,,,,,"Was excited to try au cheval after hearing so many people rave about it and reading the ridiculous reviews on this place. I came on a cold weekday night and was able to grab a spot at the bar immediately, which was nice. Hosts/Servers/everyone was friendly. The restaurant is pretty small which explains the wait times. "
,,,,,"Onto the food. I ordered the honey fried chicken and a double burger with bacon and egg. The server brought out the chicken as my appetizer (this turned out to be way too much food, but whatever). The chicken was pretty good - I'm not obsessed with the flavors, but it was a huge portion, fried well, and the sauce was decent. Reminded me of a bbq sauce mixed with sweet and sour/sweet chili sauce. Slightly tangy, and sweet, maybe a touch of heat. Overall solid dish but again nothing I'm going to crave or wait in a line for."
,,,,,"And onto the burger. It was big (double = three patties), messy, and overall a very good burger. However, I thought the patties were over seasoned (too salty), and adding the thick cut bacon to it put the salt levels over the top - I couldn't finish the burger, and this wasn't because of the amount of food I had already eaten. I actually took the bacon off."
,,,,,"Egg was done over-easy and cooked perfectly, they have an assembly line pretty much making these burgers non-stop. The overall flavor profile was ok - didn't love the sauce or the pickles though, the burger just didn't feel cohesive. Also the bun was good, but not great. I had heard that the burger wasn't the best thing on the menu and wanted to try more, but unfortunately my dinner companion bailed and here we are. "
,,,,,"I'd go back to au cheval, but I'm not in any rush to do so. A pretty typical overhyped Chicago restaurant."
,,,,,"This is my third time at the infamous Au Cheval.  There is always a 2-3 hour wait.  The question is ""Is it worth the wait?""  Well, the famous cheeseburger is good, but I do not think it's the best or top 10 burger in the United States.  It's a little too salty for me. I gave the burger three attempts before judging.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's good, it's just not great!  It's over hyped in my personal opinion.  My friends from Chicago will disagree."
,,,,,I also tried the Duck Crispy Hash and the scrabble egg with the Foie Gras.  The Foie Gras is extra rich but delicious.  Hash is extra crispy.  I recommend both.
,,,,,Service is great.  I would come back as long as there is not a 2-3 hour wait.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Delicious, juicy burgers. A must-try and staple in Chicago. Keep in mind: wait is long, but worth it!"
,,,,,Does this need any more reviews? Absolutely!
,,,,,I used to come here before it received the best burger accolades from Bon Appetit and Food Network.  Was the best burger then and years later is still the best burger.
,,,,,"But its not just the burger that keeps me coming back (OK it is the burger but...) - the General Janes, the Bologne, the Chicken Livers, the scrambled eggs and foie gras.  Everything this place does it does impeccably.  "
,,,,,Protip: Go in late (past 10PM) and you may be able to slide right in without a wait!
,,,,,"I inhaled that burger! And I'm not even a meat person.The ""single"" burger comes with two patties - juicy, flavorful, and satisfying. It didn't need the bacon, but I'm glad I got it. Spoiler alert: unlike your average bacon, it's actually a thick slab of perfectly seasoned pork belly!"
,,,,,"My friend got the honey-fried chicken which, while not THE best Korean-style fried chicken I've had, measures up to its counterparts with tender meat thanks to coca cola in the brine, and a light kick from the Gochujang sauce. "
,,,,,We came at 11am on a weekday before the lunch rush - no wait at all!
,,,,,Unimpressive. 
,,,,,"Burger is kinda boring, meat itself is prepared well but a burger isn't just a cooked meat patty. It needs more toppings. The sauce is pretty good but there's not enough of it or of the cheese. Bun is tasteless and came overly charred. Just really underwhelming. Needs more complex flavors worked in. I make a better burger at home without the hours of waiting. "
,,,,,Foie gras is a travesty. It's chopped up into bits and poured over eggs that you're supposed to eat with toast. Terrible presentation. Would be better as a whole seared piece. Eggs are tasteless and unnecessary. It ends up being mush over mush. Just because you can buy some foie gras doesn't mean you should do this to it. Just sear it and serve with a nice sauce and a sweet contrast like it's meant to be served. 
,,,,,Salad was awful. 
,,,,,"Wait time predictions are the worst. They'll say 1-1.5 hours and call you in 20 minutes later, and you only get 10 minutes to come in or you miss it. Or they'll say 1 hour and make you wait 2. Don't bother. If you really must try the burger get some takeout on a weekday. But any other burger would be better so don't bother."
,,,,,"Also music is too loud in there, makes it hard to talk instead of being festive. But I guess they don't want people staying too long so maybe that's why they blast it."
,,,,,This review is for the dine-in experience. Au Cheval has the best burger in Chicago. I've been here several times and it never disappoints. The General Jane's fried chicken + a single (double patty) or double (tripe patty) cheese burger with fries is the standard order. It's a lot of calories but oh so delicious. 
,,,,,"Only drawback (but to be expected really) is the long line around dinner. I recommend going for an early lunch around 11 AM, when there isn't much of a line. If there is a line, give them your number and walk around West Loop until they text."
,,,,,Precise but very lost on the 4 hour waiting hype. I've been trying for a year and finally went at 11pm on a Tuesday night. There was STILL a 45 minute wait. That's insane but also a testament to the popularity... Or some late night burger convention...
,,,,,I like watching them make copious amounts of patties on the gridle. It's a non-stop cycle at a scale I haven't seen before. So much so that I took a timelapse video of the process. 
,,,,,Atmosphere:
,,,,,Cool A track/audio reel at the front. Nice app for waiting status. Interesting crowd. Regular counter service at a bar. 
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,Root beer on tap was good. Goes well with burger 4/5
,,,,,Fries with cheese. 3/5. 
,,,,,Fries were pretty good but not great. The cheese sauce was not popular and that's most of the cost. I liked the other sauce.  Not worth$9. That's ludicrous. 
,,,,,Burger 3.5/5. 
,,,,,Precisely made according to rigorous standards but nothing stellar. Maybe the interstellar amount of hype doesn't help but I just had an equally good burger at a regular casual place in Oklahoma City. 
,,,,,Not sure it's worth the wait. Maybe one more chance.  Will try small Cheval to see how close it comes.
,,,,,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Au Cheval twice. However this second time was AMAZING...all I could think was...I cheated myself the first visit. Well, as most people know there is usually a long wait for this place...it's small and their food/service/drinks are great...so it's expected. Well this time I made it back one of our last warm days in the city. I was concerned about eating outside but it was the perfect day. We ordered a lot. The single with an egg and bacon....a side of bacon...a order of chicken...and fries with an added fried egg. Three cocktails each (different options). Everything was so flavorful. As I type this my mouth is watering. Truly the best burger I have ever had."
,,,,,Not all that impressed taste was ok but not Chicago's best burger for sure! Sorry not sorry...
,,,,,"Picked up takeout, rushed home and devoured it.  Delicious !  ( ...and, definitely NOT healthy eating)"
,,,,,"One of the best burgers in Chicago, hands down. I've been here multiple times and this is the first time I am reviewing it but I would hope you don't need a review to come here. The reputation speaks for itself and if you get the option to come here, take it! "
,,,,,"Wings and keep the left over sauce, a Burger (2 patties) with a fried egg and bacon, and the fries - to share, is the way to go. "
,,,,,The only thing that can be tough is the wait but it is well worth it. If you're in Chicago and have the time and appetite you have to visit at least once. 
,,,,,(I don't work here... I really just like the burger haha)
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Au Cheval officially has a special place in my heart for the best gourmet burger that I've ever had and is probably my favorite restaurant so far in Chicago. Wait times are exceptionally long (we waited 2+ hours during primetime on a Friday), but there are plenty of bars and restaurants around to pregame at on Randolph St. and the wait was well worth it. "
,,,,,"Ingredients-wise, the burger is so simple (single cheeseburger w/ thick cut bacon and fried egg, pickle on the side) yet so heavenly! Each bite is juicy and bursting with flavor thanks to the peppery, caramelized savoriness of the bacon combined with double patties cooked to perfection, slathered in melted cheese and topped with a dripping yolk. "
,,,,,"After waiting a little longer than expected for our second dish (Scrambled Eggs and Foie Gras), our waiter stopped by and informed us that the chef decided that it hadn't been prepared ""up to standards"", so our meal was being remade and would be on the house with their apologies -- A+ on service! "
,,,,,"The Scrambled Eggs and Foie Gras were also very tasty; just keep in mind that it is very strong, almost to the point of being overwhelming in flavor, in case you've never tried or aren't the biggest fan of foie gras. But the eggs were moist, fluffy and delicious and when eaten on the toast, sufficiently balance out the extreme richness of the foie gras. "
,,,,,"Sitting at the bar was fun but also kind of dangerous because I could see everything being tossed together by the chefs, which made it seriously tempting to order more dishes than we had room for because everything was so artfully prepared and looked bomb. I will most definitely be back for round 2 to try the rest of their menu next time I'm in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Make sure to visit this place empty stomach so that you can enjoy the food! The restaurant has limited seating inside so make sure to call ahead if you want an indoor seating. The ambiance is great, and the service was on point. Fried chicken was bit salty but overall it was very savory and has a nice kick of spiciness. If you are not good a eating something spicy, pass on this menu. And the burger - if you are here, you MUST order the burger, but make sure to add the bacon and the egg - it makes a huge difference. Highly highly recommend this place"
,,,,,"There's no way I couldn't not pass this up now that its deliverable. Probably only thing good about covid is that we don't have to wait hours for a seat. This is my third time having this burger, this time, I had the double cheeseburger so three meat patties with bacon. There has no option for the egg but I personally thought the egg is too much. I originally ordered the single but they accidentally gave me the double!"
,,,,,"It was really quick too, took about fifteen minutes for it to be ready to be picked up. Again, burger was fantastic, just marvelous, beadbwas not soggy However, I think that the single is better because at this point is just a meat party in your mouth overpowering everything else. However, this time, not sure if they changed the sauce or forgot it but it was missing the lemony flavors. I also noticed this when I had the burger the second time. The first time i had the burger, there was not lemony flavor from the dijonaise (I think that is where its coming from). I tasted the lemon flavor the second time I had the burger and that destroyed any criticism of the burger I had for it not having much acidity and freshness to cut through all the beef and bacon. Sadly, this time, the burger was missing that lemony goodness. Still a fantastic burger but I hope they bring that sauce back."
,,,,,"I had to come back and I'm glad I did. Wanted to try something different so I went with the foie Gras with eggs. Easily can say best eggs I've had hands down. Eggs were nice and soft, almost like a custard. And the sauce was magnificent. Had strong carmelized onion and beefy notes that perfectly elevated the eggs. Foie Gras was just and added bonus. So decadent and soft, just melts in your mouth once you bite into it. Only slight complaint is if it's worth 19$? I only had a few pieces of foie Gras and besides that, it's eggs. Burger however, somehow got better than I remembered. Bun is perfect everytime, and the sauce seemed to have a lemon note I didn't get last time which I really enjoyed. I can wait tk come back to try everything else they have to offer. Also, we came during Tuesday lunch and there was no wait, which was awesome as well."
,,,,,"Luckily we only waited 45 min in a Sunday morning. This was a fantastic burger, definitely lived up to the hype. Although, I would have liked a bit more freshness and acidity to cut through all that meat. Definitely a meat lovers dream."
,,,,,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon around 12, and waited for 20 minutes before being seated at the bar; the wait wasn't too bad considering how packed it was! Service was smooth and quick, and it was fun seeing the chefs do their magic in the kitchen :)"
,,,,,"We got the bone marrow and burger; the bone marrow was DELICIOUS but i wish there was more actual marrow. The ""depth"" of bones are kind of a hit or miss since you can't really tell but the toast was amazing and the marmalade (~$19). The all famous burger was quite good, but I was wishing for something fresh (maybe a vegetable) since it was very heavy with fatty things. The egg is an extra ~$2 and the bacon an extra ~$5, so it came out to be a very pricey lunch but I was stuffed!"
,,,,,"The food and drink were great! However, our first impression, the host, was very condescending and unaccommodating.  "
,,,,,"Thankfully, the wait staff made up for his poor customer service."
,,,,,Heard they had the best cheeseburger here so of course I had to try it while in Chicago! My cousin took me here and we all ordered the cheeseburger. The standard burger comes with 2 patties which is called a single. Double would be 3 patties and triple would b 4! You can also add an egg and/or bacon with it. 
,,,,,"I ordered an egg with the burger which is a must. I would recommend ordering bacon on the side or if you're really hungry, order the burger with the bacon as well but I highly recommend ordering just a side of bacon. The burger was good and the meat was cooked perfectly! The added egg was a nice touch. The side of bacon was phenomenal. Sooo good and flavorful! I think I might've liked the bacon more than the burger itself! Lol. The side of pickle they had was really good also! "
,,,,,We also ordered a side of hash browns. Hash browns were great and had a nice crunch! Service was really great. The waiter we had was attentive and knew his stuff. I would definitely recommend coming here. My cousin and her fiancé was really shocked that we didn't have to wait for a table which was really unusual because they said they would usually have to wait for at least an hour. Lucky us!
,,,,,Loved it here! I was a solo traveler on a Thursday night. I put my name down on the wait list in person at 9.30pm and it was ready in about 40 mins. 
,,,,,The burger was amazing!! I had it with the egg. The service was great and attentive (although the host seemed to have a bit of
,,,,,"Five stars, which I don't give easy. It looks like the standard order is the cheeseburger and the fries with egg and aioli. My boyfriend and I split the burger and asked for it with bacon and sautéed onions- apparently with egg is good too. Hands down the best burger I've ever had. We're already trying to fly back just to come here. Highly recommend. "
,,,,,Very intimate ambiance which feels personal and a full cocktail list. No reservations. We came at 10:30 and were seated immediately but by 11 there wasn't an open seat in the place.
,,,,,"Touted as having one of the best burgers in the country, Au Cheval definitely made our list for must-try stops in Chicago, and it was a delicious stop indeed."
,,,,,"With a reputation so big, it was expected that we'd have to wait, especially around dinner time. Our estimated wait time was 75 minutes and ended up being pretty exact for our party of 2 on a Monday night. This didn't bother us too much since we knew going in that it would be a while and they have a great texting system where you can put your name down and leave until your table is ready! "
,,,,,"The restaurant itself has dimly lit retro bar vibes with booth and bar seating. Once it was finally our turn to be seated, we ended up at the counter facing the cooks in action in the open kitchen, which was actually a treat! You could see each part of the burger getting made, and it added to the anticipation of getting your own. "
,,,,,"We both went straight for their specialty and ordered single cheeseburgers - the single is actually a double cheeseburger with two patties and slices of cheese each. I added the egg, while the fiancé added both egg and bacon as well as fries. The burger comes alone with a pickle on the side unless you order extras. The food came out fairly quickly considering how busy they were but we did see how efficient they were in the kitchen from our seats."
,,,,,"I was worried that I'd be let down but the burger was actually really delicious! I cut it in half because it was already pretty decently sized and besides the yolk dripping a bit, it wasn't extremely messy to eat and everything stayed inside. Each bite was flavorful and tasty, and I was surprised how quickly I was able to inhale it...and how sad I was once I had finished. I probably could've eaten more at the time but did feel more full later in the evening, so it was still fairly satisfying on its own. My only minor complaint was that the second half of my burger started getting a little cold towards the end, but that may have been my fault from taking too many pictures in the beginning..."
,,,,,"Overall, the burger was very good and was worth the wait and visit just to try. The price was also reasonable for the size and the service was friendly despite how stressful it must've been serving so many people. It's probably a bit overhyped and we wouldn't wait routinely that long after now having had it, but I don't think it was too outrageous to at least experience once while you're in the area!"
,,,,,"The burger was good, the crispy fries with egg were decadent goodness with the perfectly fried egg,  mornay sauce, garlic aioli  on the side. While the food was all well made and flavorful, the prices are steeply inflated for a burger & fries."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Best hamburger I've ever tried.
,,,,,Their Home made French fries were also superb.
,,,,,Attentive staffs.
,,,,,Must come again!
,,,,,"We had a chance to come for lunch and was lucky to not have had to wasn't very long to be rated . We charged the burger and the wings which was more than enough. Everything was delicious! Very rich in flavor. We also got to Bloody Mary which was pretty good as well. Overall, worth the visit and hope to come again."
,,,,,"this place was all hype, mcdonald's cheeseburger is much better & the bologna sandwich was a complete joke. it was my husband's birthday and he pick these place because of the reviews, let me tell you the truth!!! these ppl leaving great reviews are ""monkey see monkey do"" the food is a bad joke and the price is even less funny."
,,,,,"you know your not in a great burger spot, whn the waiter doesn't ask you how would you like your burger cooked. not even the buns was of quality. the bologna sandwich was a piece of flavorless nothing. the fries was thin small pieces of nothing. i really don't understand how this place got such a good reputation for having awesome burgers, 60 bucks for crap. extremely small restuarant with long lines for terrible burgers. i wish i could give them zero stars."
,,,,,"Finally made it to Au Cheval this summer. It's always tough to get into, but due to Covid, it's pretty easy now. So tip: run there now! I had to check out the hype... did not disappoint. Giving out a rare 5*! This burger is so good, I've been back TWICE since. The service is great. And pair this with a $3 tallboy. Also had the matzo ball soup last time, perfect winter outdoor meal. Thanks so much AC!"
,,,,,Hip place for late-night foods. We were able to enjoy their cheeseburger with fried egg and bacon.  Their fried chicken and chilaquiles are good.
,,,,,"If you don't mind the wait, come for a late-night munching."
,,,,,"I had heard great things about the burgers at Au Cheval, so imagine my disappointment that the double cheeseburger I ordered made me physically ill and made me throw up for over an hour. The culprit was undercooked meat. "
,,,,,"I called to inform the restaurant and left my info, but no one contacted me. "
,,,,,"I don't like leaving poor ratings, especially in COVID times...I love supporting local businesses.  However my personal experience did not align with the amazing ratings for this restaurant."
,,,,,Au Cheval
,,,,,"Hailed as the best burger in Chitown, Au Cheval in West Loop (Fulton Market) has always been on my to-go to foodie list. I've lived in Chicago for two years and I haven't had the chance to try it then. Now I'm visiting I made sure to give it a shot to see if it does live to its hype. "
,,,,,"Eating out alone has its ups and downs. I used to be so self-conscious with dining out alone but I don't care so much about it now. I'm doing it for the love of food. And no one really gives a damn haha TBH. But i especially enjoy the perks of dining solo in this occasion because with a party of one, you easily get seated at the bar. Within 10 mins that I listed my name, I got a text that a space is ready for me and they'll hold it for 10 mins. Make sure you just roam within the vicinity and always check your phone. For bigger parties, it can be an ordeal because on a Monday night after work, you can wait for up to 1 hour or more. Their texting feature allows you to check in your status to keep you abreast of where you're at."
,,,,,"Of course as a first timer, I got myself the single Au Cheval burger with egg and bacon. Easy on the patties because the single comes with 2 patties. It comes with fries and garlic aioli which I  liked more than the burger itself. It was okay :) I probably shouldn't have eaten dessert at BomboBar first before dinner but I purposely didn't eat anything today so I can savor the flavor. Although I would say it's very tasty but it's not mind blowing to me. Sorry to Au Cheval fans. The bacon tasted more of like a millionaire's bacon to me. I'm glad I added the egg to add more flavor to the it. I'm not really the gourmet type so I could be wrong. I was actually torn with getting the Foie Gras entree and/or the chicken but I'll most definitely try it next time with friends. And see how long I'll have to wait then and if I'll feel any differently."
,,,,,Absolutely incredible- a must visit in Chicago. 
,,,,,"Lines get long so be prepared. We went as a group of 3 at 5:15 Thursday and waited for roughly 45-50min. Luckily, there are plenty of bars around the area to make the wait more enjoyable."
,,,,,We all got the single burger with egg and bacon. It's extremely filling so don't be misled by the fact it's a single burger. Getting an egg and bacon is a absolute must. You'll understand why when you see the picture.
,,,,,"We also shared the crispy fries with garlic aioli & fried egg and the fried bologna sandwich. Both were tasty. Fries are fun to share with a group- way too big for one person. The bologna sandwich had a great salty and meaty flavor. I'm not sure if I'd get a whole sandwich for myself, but definitely good to share."
,,,,,"The ratio of ingredients of their burger is perfect. Definitely miss dining indoors, but the ambience and food were worth the wait. I've had the single patty burger, Jane street chicken wings and fried bologna sandwich on diff occasions. All are very solid choices, but i come back for their burger. The chicken wings are good for sharing as well. You can never go wrong with fries and get lots of their garlic aioli."
,,,,,"If you are looking for a classic cheeseburger with the perfect ratio, this is it. I would say def get it with an egg. If you get bacon, it might be a little too salty. "
,,,,,The chicken wings are very good/solid and the fried bologna sandwich is good if you want to try something different. 
,,,,,Loved the ambience going solo and with friends. Watching them cook at the bar is always fun experience and the music is always spot on.
,,,,,"Definitely overblown/overrated. Some folks would wait 1 or 2 hours, or even more... I frankly don't see why this place attracts such attention/fandom."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"The classic single cheeseburger with (sunny side-up) egg - 4/5 - THERE'S NO LETTUCE NOR TOMATO, just comes with mayo and pickles. The buttery artisan bun tastes excellent. The single is actually a double slab, cooked medium rare. But I don't like how salty the meat is. Ketchup definitely helped moderate the saltiness."
,,,,,"If you like egg on your burger, I definitely say that the Royal Red Robin burger at Red Robin beats this IMO. "
,,,,,Ambience:
,,,,,Low-lot bar restaurant playing loud music (90s hits). Problem is it gets crowded and cramped making the place feel smaller than what it probably is.
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,I feel bad for the host who does their best because they must manage such crowds and  long waitlist. 
,,,,,Excellent waiting staff members who are friendly and often check on diners.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Amazing burgers. Opt for the single, it's plenty big! If you plan on going, go early because there is almost guaranteed to be a 2hour wait during peak dinner hours. WELL WORTH IT!!"
,,,,,A magical experience from start to finish. We were just two and found a seat at the bar for dinner almost immediately.
,,,,,"If you want to try the burger, skip the 4 hour wait and just go to Small Cheval. It's pretty comparable -- even down to the fries & garlic aioli. I may even venture to say it tastes BETTER without a painfully long wait!"
,,,,,"But, PROTIP: we walked up with no wait right upon opening @ 10am on a Saturday. "
,,,,,"My friends ordered the burger, but I had the:"
,,,,,"*foie gras & scrambled eggs - this comes served with a side of buttery thick toast that reminded me of texas toast. The dish itself was so tasty - a hint of sweet + shallot notes. However, it was really rich, I could only eat half of it. They were really generous with the foie! "
,,,,,"*jon's blueberry muffin - Jon was apparently one of the OGs at Au Cheval. He sounds like he's no longer with the company BUT his recipe is made from scratch daily & then cut in half and toasted. Served with hot fudge (?? but I'm not complaining), strawberry preserve & salted butter! "
,,,,,"Overall, I can see the appeal of Au Cheval! Great portions = good value, but not worth the wait for the burger!"
,,,,,"Well, I finally got here!"
,,,,,"Having missed out previously due to the well-known long waits, I finally got lucky with a spot at the counter on a Wednesday afternoon. "
,,,,,Was it worth it? Absolutely. 
,,,,,"Service is quick, friendly and efficient. You feel welcome and not rushed; for a place with consistent lines out the door, that's impressive. "
,,,,,"As for the food. I went with the cheeseburger with an egg, and a side of fries. The cheeseburger was excellent: fresh, perfectly cooked, juicy with the right amount of seasoning. Loved it! And the fries were perfect - seasoned to perfected and cooked just right. "
,,,,,"So why only 4 stars? Perhaps the hype took away some of the greatness, but I have had equally good burgers around town. And while the burger was very fairly priced, the side of fries (while delicious and plentiful) were not."
,,,,,Best burger hands down. The ingredients and everything involved in making this masterpiece is awesome! Just a great experience to go.
,,,,,"Today I went to try the famous cheeseburger and famous fried chicken.  Foods are subpar, overpriced plus service charge 3.25% for food.  With 2 entrees and no drinks.  My totals bill was $54 with tax and tips."
,,,,,"Au Cheval is the best! They have the best and amazing cheeseburger I have ever eaten in my whole life. This is definitely the perfect place to get yourself a phenomenal burger. The patty is so tender, meaty, and juicy. While their fries are so flavorful, crispy, and it has a perfect dip sauce. Also I recommend to add some bacon to your sandwiches it is so lit and delicious. Their place is so easy to find, so don't hesitate to stop by, visit their wonderful place, and try their excellent meals. You will definitely be comfortable at their place, it is so simple, cozy, and casual. Best place to have fun and satisfy our cravings. Will definitely visit here again when I go back in Chicago. Thank you Au Cheval for such an amazing experience. Thumbs up guys! See you soon, kudos!"
,,,,,Was recommended to me by many people. Glad I made the trip during work hours. A bit tough to get here in traffic and the place gets really busy but well worth the wait and trip.
,,,,,Great burger/bar vibe and great menu with all around great eats. Got the Au Cheval cheeseburger which was fantastic. Definitely recommend you try this place if you're in Chicago!
,,,,,"Open for pick-up/delivery during the pandemic! Ordering Au Cheval for take-out has never been an option in the past, so when I saw this opportunity, I had to jump on it. This used to be my favorite burger in the city until their smaller counterpart opened up. And eating this burger again reminded me of why. This burger is massive and heavy. It's definitely good, but I regret eating it every time! Prepare yourself for the meat sweats. The fries are really good and they include a little cup of garlic aioli. I'll have to remember next time to only eat half a burger in one sitting!"
,,,,,"Their burger with bacon and egg is my favorite in Chicago. So perfectly balanced, creamy, and.. pretty. The bone marrow is a pretty generous portion. It's definitely large enough for more than 2 people to share. The fries with garlic aioli is really yummy, too. The second time I stopped by, they were out of the matzoh ball soup.. bummer. On a weekday night around 5:30pm, there was a 20 minute wait for a table for 2. On a Sunday at 10pm, there was no wait to sit at the bar. I will definitely be back for their burger and also to try the matzoh ball soup."
,,,,,My favorite restaurant in Chicago... and possibly the world. I make it a point to try to come here whenever I am in town.
,,,,,"Yes, the wait is usually very long. Especially if you come during the dinner time or even lunchtime rush. So either plan to come at an off time - like right at 11 for lunch - or plan to put your name down and find something to do to kill a couple hours (or 3). There are plenty of bars and even adult arcades nearby to pass the time quickly. "
,,,,,"The food is totally worth the wait! Of course, the cheeseburger is a must. I prefer mine a single (confusing, but really 2 patties), with the fried egg but no bacon - I just think the thick cut on top of two beef patties is too heavy. The duck fat fries with garlic aioli on the side are the perfect complement to the burger. And to start, my husband and I always get the General Jane's Fried Chicken. It's so tasty - almost as good as the burger itself! Between the two of us, the chicken, 1 burger (split), and side of fries is plenty of food, but if you're a fan of foie gras or bone marrow I've only ever heard great things about them!"

,,,,,Au Cheval serves one of the best burgers that lives up to the hype!
,,,,,"For Chef's Table: Alinea, Grant Achatz is featured eating here touting how great the burger was.  Given his culinary genius, I knew that this place must be pretty legit.  Plus, on previous occasions, I would come by and the line would be super long.  So with such high expectations, I felt like I was for sure to be let down.  Gladly, I was not disappointed!"
,,,,,"Au Cheval itself means the process of putting a fried egg on a sandwich.  The burger itself was decadent in all of its fatty juiciness stacked with two 4 oz beef patties and American Cheese melted between each.  Between the hot toasted buns was generous amounts of mayo and pieces of pickle that provided a nice creaminess and a little acidic kick to balance it all out.  Ugh!  Calories aside, this was great."
,,,,,"People mention the foie gras and scrambled eggs but it was nothing compared to the cheeseburger.  The foie gras is slathered generously with a sweet sauce to pair with the savoriness of the meat, but it was a little too much for my taste.  Even paired with the egg, it was still a little overly sweet.  The only way this dish's sweetness was tolerable was with the toast that was provided.  "
,,,,,"In terms of the service, it was pretty quick and efficient.  Would highly recommend coming earlier to avoid the crowds.  Parking here can get difficult, but you can walk or Uber."
,,,,,"Overall, Au Cheval has a burger that is definitely worth the visit when you come to Chicago!"
,,,,,"The hype is indeed, real. No wait time as we just sat outside! Ordered a couple of yummy cocktails (I got the Strange Brew that had pineapple, gin, ipa, lemon. HIGHLY recommend)!"
,,,,,"You could tell all the food was high quality. Fries with garlic aioli, thick ass bacon pieces, and even the buns on our burger. I personally thought the burger patty was really salty but did that stop me from eating the whole thing? Nope!"
,,,,,"If you haven't taken advantage of carryout during the pandemic, please do it! The burger traveled well and was delicious!  Initially, my fiancé didn't want to carry out bc he was worried the meal wouldn't be as good as when we dined in (pre covid). Well, we ordered online, which was super easy, and picked up with minimal contact and had a delicious meal. The single burger with bacon and eggs was just as good as I remembered!  They also packaged the egg separately so everything didn't get mushy. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"Amazing burger as always! But really big shout-out to the hostess and server for making our day. The scene: we got on a 6 AM train for a work day trip to milwaukee.  The train broke down in WI and we were without heat, power or running water in the toilets for 3 hours. 8 hours later, we got back to Chicago without EVER having gotten to Milwaukee. I took the team to au cheval for a late lunch. There was a 20 min ish wait at 2:30 on a Tuesday which is the shortest I've ever had it. I explained to the host what our day already entailed and apologized if we smelled (no running water) and she hooked us up with a round on the house."
,,,,,"We all got the single burger with bacon and egg, order of butter pickles and fries and it made our day! Our server also sent over a dessert with a candle to cheer us up."
,,,,,AMAZING customer service!!!
,,,,,One of my fave places for a burger but this visit was lacking. I went for my usual order of a single burger with egg and bacon when the server said they were out of bacon! Bacon! On a Sunday brunch day! The fries with mornay sauce were good per usual.
,,,,,So we waited out at Bar Siena before our table was ready at Au Cheval where we had bloody Mary's which were great. Think the bloody Mary's there were better than at Au Cheval. Could also be that it took forever to get our drinks here.
,,,,,We left pretty full but were bummed about the bacon and bloody.
,,,,,Great burger! Recommend reservations or getting there as soon as it opens as is a very tight space!
,,,,,"Nothing bad to say at all. The cheese burger, a classic favorite. For a while, the milkshakes when delivered through an app, were not tamper proof which was unsettling. They now wrap them in plastic wrap to keep them sanitary during the delivery process, which is more appropriate. I bring all of my out of town friends and associates here for a tasty lunch. They always love it! Makes for a rather nice dinner as well on a relaxed evening. Staff is great. The milkshakes are superb."
,,,,,"My BF and I have been here several times and we've actually been lucky enough to not have to wait too long most times. We tend to order the single cheeseburger, fries and drinks most times and haven't branched out too much honestly because the burgers are just so good. BF got bacon on a cheeseburger once and an egg another time and liked both. I also really like their cocktails and fries with the aioli. The first time we went we noticed our fries were super salty so since then we order them with no salt and they are perfect! This is a great place to bring people from out of town, I would just suggest coming either super late or super early. If you like the Au Cheval burger I'd also highly recommend trying the Loyalist burger next!"
,,,,,"My most favorite meal in Chicago by far! First, it's a pretty small restaurant and even though we got there shortly after 5 PM on a Tuesday, it was packed! Gave my phone number for updated texts for our table. Squeezed into the back, and our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was so great and helpful!"
,,,,,"Made my own version of a moscow mule and it hit the spot. My friend and I both got a single cheeseburger with bacon and egg, and shared the crispy fried hash with duck fat gravy and egg."
,,,,,"Our food came out soon, and I do wish I had asked if there were pickles on the burger because I cannot stand the smell of them, and picked them off. Luckily it did not ruin the burger because it was so damn delicious. The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked and sweet to all the savory. The sauce on the burger was divine, though I do with the egg (as pretty as it was) was runnier. The crispy fried hash....lord...so crunchy and so fatty, but it was all so so so good! I would eat this meal everyday if I didn't care about the waistline or the clogged arteries!"
,,,,,"Loved everything about this meal, and would definitely come again if I was back in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Current status: food coma. Best burger I've had in a long time! Came in on a Saturday around 11am. It was just myself so I was able to snag the last open spot at the bar with no wait. If you don't mind sitting at the bar and there is only one or two of you, you may get lucky and not have to wait. Otherwise, when I was leaving, I heard it was about 1-1.5 hours for people walking up around 1145. "
,,,,,Get the burger. Add bacon and egg and you won't regret it.
,,,,,"If you know, you know"
,,,,,"The bacon is worth it. Get it on the side, slap some on your burger and eat the rest for breakfast the next day. Trust me"
,,,,,"The female check-in staff was very abrupt, rude and unwelcoming. You would think that after waiting 2 hrs to come eat at their establishment they would be at least be decently kind to your guests and not talk down to them. Food was ok- nothing to write home about, wait 2 hrs for and then be yelled at by the staff."

,,,,,"My first time to this restaurant.  I think by far it's the best burger in town, the meat was tender and juicy, the fries were cooked perfectly and the waiter was very good his service was excellent.The bone marrow  is a must tpairing with Texas toast and the sweet onion glaze is not to be missed."
,,,,,Service was awesome!!!! Definitely go back.
,,,,,Went around 1130AM during the weekday and did not have to wait at all!
,,,,,"The burger was delicious! Loved the bacon, the egg, the bun, the entire combo. Plus the amazing french fries and the sweet pickles.. delicious!"
,,,,,The cocktail I had was really good- Bees Knees.
,,,,,"Boyfriend and I split a burger, and it was the perfect amount."
,,,,,"Would definitely go back when in Chicago again, but I would not wait long to eat here."
,,,,,Au Cheval is everything my mom wanted me to be. Best in class. World famous. Worth the wait. 
,,,,,"If it's true that you are what you eat, than I've finally made her proud. "
,,,,,"Best burger I've ever had -- in Chicago, in the Midwest, in the Western Hemisphere, in the world. I'm not too well-traveled. Get it with the bacon and with the egg. Their other dishes are great too."
,,,,,Orgasm on buns
,,,,,Pickle in the middle
,,,,,I'm sorry mom
,,,,,"it's a chicago staple and if you're visiting the city i recommend coming and trying. the good is good and fresh, decent portions too and if you're a fan of honey mustard get some with your fries! i've only sat in outside dining so i can't attest to the inside."
,,,,,Stopped in to grab a cheeseburger. Absolutely excellent. Quick and easy service. I was in and our for lunch very quickly. Worth the trip.
,,,,,Truly the best burger in the city. The cheeseburger is the perfect size and don't forget the bacon . One fries can be split by three
,,,,,Aww Cheval I so wanted to love you. You were hyped up to be the best burger in Chicago... possibly the US... You let me down. 
,,,,,"The atmosphere is great, especially later in the evening. Dark cozy and cool! Good music, tons of people. Just a fun place to eat. "
,,,,,"The food fell short. In summery, a single is really two thinner patties with American cheese, onion and Dijon sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and standardized. Not too well, not to medium. "
,,,,,"However, the patties tasted like they took a salt bath. All you could taste was salt on top of salt. No lettuce or tomato to balance the salt either. Just American cheese, another bland salty element."
,,,,,"We ordered fries called crispy fries. They were not crispy, but soggy. The garlic aioli was the best part of that dish. The fried egg on top while photogenic and promising was merely covered, in again, SALT."
,,,,,"Last, while the hash brown dish was huge, it tasted like it had been fried in oil that was stale and old. When mixed with the chunky duck heart gravy and another salty fried egg, it was downright sickening. "
,,,,,The best part of our meal was our root beer float. Solid very well carbonated root beer and creamy gelato. Can't go wrong there. Really the saving grace of the entire meal.
,,,,,"This is a one and done for us. Not worth the hour wait, we only waited 20 minutes on a week night. Definitely not the best burger in the city or suburbs!"
,,,,,"The burger was delicious but honestly just a bit too heavy for me. My expectations were super high because Au Cheval is very hyped up and always has a long wait. We came for lunch so we were seated immediately and the servers were very attentive and friendly. Ordered the cheeseburger with classic add ons (egg and bacon) and it tasted great. It's just a very oily and fatty meal so come hungry and be prepared. Overall, a solid restaurant but a bit overhyped."
,,,,,"Absolutely phenomenal flavor in the burger, but the texture leaves something to be desired. The patty itself has a bit too much chew to it, think breakfast sausage patty. Maybe you're into that, but I'm not. Delicious if you're in the area and have the time, but not my favorite burger in the city. Perhaps I just need to go back again, but who has the time?"
,,,,,I got to say this place was good!  My son seen this place on a 'top burger in IL' and he said he wanted to try it.  So the place is a good hour away. So I told my gang we had to leave at 4pm tonite. We got there at 5. Found street parking right around the corner.  Guy said it would be 20 minutes. But after like 5-6min he came and got us. Got a seat right by the door.  We mainly ordered burgers and we tried the wings. And had the mille feuille?? I don't remember if that was what it was. But everything was delish!  It is pricy. But the beef on those burgers was legit! And dessert was even better.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"One of the best burgers of my life! I got the single burger (which actually had two patties) with the thick cut bacon on top. The burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned right, but I think it's really the bacon that made it shine. The bacon was perfect!!! All the flavors just came together right. I also got the fries with the garlic aioli. I thought they were good, but I honestly didn't think they were worth the price. I wouldn't have gotten them if I had realized the single burger was actually a double. "
,,,,,"I wasn't drinking that night, but it was very hard to resist getting a drink or beer. They had a very nice selection. The space was really cute with nice lighting. Good music. The staff was very attentive. I would want to go on a date here."
,,,,,Au Cheval is the perfect burger place if you're feeling chill with just a splash of bougie. The food is SO good. The shaved steak with au jus is *chefs kiss*. The burgers are out of this world and the bacon is pricey but will send your tastebuds to flavor town. 
,,,,,"Highly recommend the chocolate martini, it taste like an adult sundae."
,,,,,"This is probably my favorite burger place. I got the double cheeseburger and added an egg and bacon. I didn't realize that a double = three patties!! Was a pleasant surprise for me, but not my friend who isn't much of a meat eater (haha). The bacon is thick cut and so so good, it really brought the burger together and was my favorite part. We also got the roasted marrow bones and crispy fries. The roasted marrow bones is a MUST. It is so decadent and delicious. I still dream about it to this day lol. The fries are also solid and I really enjoyed the mornay sauce it came with. Would def recommend eating here!!! Get there early to put your name down and walk around the area until your table is ready, we waited about an hour on a Saturday during lunch time."
,,,,,"I'll need to revisit Au Cheval and am interested in trying the Foie gras scramble. The burger was good, not as good as people in Chicago rave about, but very solid."
,,,,,I'm so glad that a friend of my husband recommended us this place... husbands says is the best burger he has eaten in his entire life ... I have to second that .. he ordered the double with egg... he was mute the entire lunch just enjoying the flavors .. we are from miami and we can say this is far beyond of our expectations .. do not miss this place if you are in Chicago!
,,,,,"I had been wanting to try this place for so long after all the ratings and great reviews. Sadly, the burger I had was too salty. I had the single cheeseburger with an egg and the crispy fries. The fries were really good, with both sauces and the egg on top. They were delish. I just wish my burger was the same, but I just don't like salty burgers. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere was ok, it was crowded on a Friday night, but that was to be expected since Fulton Market is full of great restaurants. "
,,,,,"Overall, the food, atmosphere, and service are ok. I will give Au Cheval 3 stars for their fries, toast, and drinks."
,,,,,"My husband is obsessed with this place. Sadly, I think it's ok. Is it better than other burger places? Yes. Is it the best I've had? No. "
,,,,,"However, really great vibes and good drinks."
,,,,,"This is the best burger in the city, and quite possibly the best in the world. There is a pretty long wait usually due to it's popularity but they take your name and number and send you a text when it's ready. The burger is cooked perfectly, and make sure to get the egg on top. It complements the patty to a tee. Aside from that, their loaded fry situation is bomb and the chicken is something to check out if you're not in a burger mood."
,,,,,OMG amazing service!! Had to spit my gum out at the booth and the waitress CAME OVER WITH A TRASH CAN and I spit my gum out. Amazing experience 10/10!!
,,,,,"Everyone raves about the burgers, they're good. I'm a fries connoisseur, & I have never in my life had such perfection. I couldn't believe it. This was pre pandemic and we sat indoors. They were literally perfectly crunchy and seasoned. Whoever made them knew what they were doing! The food in general is really good. Definitely a great spot to dine at."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Waited around 20-30 minutes on a Friday evening. Not bad considering it could take hours. Our server was kind and the food came really quick. We both got a single cheeseburger with bacon, so good!!!! Perfectly cooked and the bacon was thick and fatty but crispy. It also had several little pickles which I enjoyed even though I'm not a pickle fan lol. Overall had a great time, a must try!"
,,,,,"Alright so i finally got to try the amazing and iconic Au Cheval. I have had small Cheval many times but this is closer to me, so I took advantage during covid and picked up some burgers."
,,,,,"I mean the burgers are exactly the same as Small Cheval in my opinion.....purely delicious!  I love that everything could be done through their online ordering system, but I wished that they would've had an option for customizing or adding extra sides.....like the garlic aioli :)  The team was great and gladly added them once I arrived and asked for them though with no issue.  "
,,,,,Glad that we were able to indulge even though it costs a few extra bucks vs Small Cheval....but I totally get it based on the location and vibe of the restaurant vs Small.  Would love to get a chance to come back one day and actually be able to have a sit down here.  I can imagine their wait times will be even farther out of this world with social distancing but I mean that's what happens when you make an amazing burger like this! :)
,,,,,"We had a wonderful dinner tonight.  Dominiqua (hope I spelled that correctly) was our server.  Friendly, attentive and helpful.  She was wonderful.  All the others who served were also helpful and friendly.  "
,,,,,The bartender makes a great hot toddy and brought our dessert.  He was engaging and shared his drink ideas for hot toddy recipes.  
,,,,,The food was fantastic.  We had so much flavor in every bite.  Chicken as an appetizer and the flavorful burgers.  But the Milles Feuille for dessert is incredible.  
,,,,,Hello e sat outside in the tent and it was warm and the service made it warmer.  Cannot wait to return.
,,,,,We heard so much and looked forward to trying for ourselves.  IT was excellent.  We were told 45-60 minute wait but were seated in 35 minutes.
,,,,,Service was excellent.  Fast and friendly.  The food is outstanding.  We all had the cheeseburgers and added egg.  The bacon is work the calories and cost!
,,,,,We also had the fries with egg.  Delicious!  The sauces are perfect.
,,,,,Only drawback is it is noist and the music is loud.
,,,,,"Always amazing. You have to get egg and bacon on your single cheeseburger to fully experience this burger. I typically don't like bacon and my girlfriend doesn't like thick bacon....this bacon, however, is necessary."
,,,,,"As for the fries, would've liked if they were seasoned lightly versus no seasoning at all. But, this review is for the burger."
,,,,,"During a Solo travel trip to Chicago I wanted a burger a really good burger.  Flying solo has its advantages.  On arrive to the diner approx 1100,  the outside seating was full and the host told the couple in front of me approx 45 minutes.  I braced myself for a wait,  but there was one seat in the bar.  The bar is the best seat in a diner!  I ordered the single (which had 2 patties) with everything accompanying pickles, dijon and cheese.  I added thick cut bacon, runny egg and foie gras.  It came with a dill pickle spear.  Burger was outstanding thin patties but still pink and juicy.  Bun thick and toasted and just enough dijonmayo to flavor the whole burger,  the yolk just pulling everything together,  the foie gras adding that ridiculous richness you didn't know you need.  My only complaint about the bacon was the insane amount of pepper.  But the sweet bacon was a nice addition to the already perfect burger.  Could have gone back everyday.  Wish I had another stomach."
,,,,,"This is the review for you if you don't want to wait 3 hours for the famous Au Cheval burger. It was my first time and let's just say I got lucky. Stopped in on a Monday at 11:45 and by the time I put my name down, there was already an hour wait. Found out the 1st six seats at the bar are open seating and my boyfriend noticed 4 people were signing their check so we creepily stood behind them until they got up and took their seats. Simple as that!"
,,,,,"When you order the burger, you HAVE to add the egg and bacon. Then get ready for the best burger experience of your life. Imagine a buttery bun, juicy patties, melty melty cheese, food porny egg yolk, sweet peppery bacon and the most perfect pickles. The fries with garlic aioli are also a nice complement. Definitely try the root beer to wash down your burger."
,,,,,Love the rustic diner feel and the friendly staff. Not sure how they keep the energy up despite the hectic crowds. Definitely a Chicago must!
,,,,,"At this point I think its pointless because everybody knows how good this place is. Chicago's Au Cheval serves up arguably one of the best burgers in the United States. Au Cheval does not accept reservations. They welcome guests on a first come first serve basis, which makes things tough at times but its totally worth it. Small Cheval s totally bomb as well."
,,,,,This place was amazing! The food is on point with everything down to the T! My sister Michelle Villarreal knows the chef! Thank you for the experience!
,,,,,"This place is a  MUST when you are in town, but be prepared for very long wait tImes. The establishment is small but the atmosphere is incredible! I dined here last night for my birthday while in Chicago for an event. There were five of us and the wait time was about an hour and a half, there's a brewery right across the street, which is a great place to wait because there's really no where to hang in Au Cheval while you wait as ppl are eating at the small bar area too. Once you put your name in, you'll get a text with a confirmation and  tracking to your wait time as iit adjusts. Once you get your text- you have 10 minutes to get back to claim your table. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious, we ordered a lot to try but we had the bone marrow, peppered bacon, pickles, rootbeer and then everyone got a single burger which is really a double! Delicious. "
,,,,,I'd love to come back next time I'm in Chicago!
,,,,,Au Cheval never fails. Their burgers are always flavorful and delicious and the garlic aoli paired with the fries are to die for. Loooooove this place!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Burgers are worth the hype! We sat at the counter - basically front row seats to see what's cookin'. I just wish I'd known the Single is actually two patties - I ordered the double.... So much food!  :)
,,,,,"Sweet sweet burger heaven. Recently visited ChiTown for work and was told this was the best burger in town. I have to say, it's probably one of the best I've ever had. With two patties, a bun that tastes almost like a pretzel roll, handmade sauces and pickles, and the thickest cut bacon, this burger was absolutely delicious. "
,,,,,"The restaurant itself is small with exposed brick, hanging lights (diner style) and an open kitchen at the bar. I love the ambiance in here and they play music from an old like, tape player type thing. "
,,,,,"Small menu but that's because they do those things really really well. Waited over an hour (during the week, even) and wouldn't take it back for anything. "
,,,,,DINE HERE!
,,,,,It's alright..... fries are great.  The burger is good but very basic. A few pieces of meat between some bread and that's it.  
,,,,,"Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."

,,,,,"Not so sure you get what you pay for here, but if you want to drop a ton of money for burgers then this is your spot."
,,,,,I was looomg for places to eat in Chicago and this place popped up a couple of times so we had to try it. We wanted to avoid the wait so we came right when it opened. It actually opened a little before 11am too. We were seated quickly. The staff was great! Super friendly. 
,,,,,We got two of the single burgers with the bacon and egg. Underneath the egg there were red onions and mayo (or another sauce). I personally don't like onions so but I just scooped it off!
,,,,,"For a $18+ burger, I was hoping it wouLd be worth my money, and it was! The single actually comes with two meats (I'm not sure why) PLUS the thick slice of melt in your mouth bacon. The bacon is a MUST!!!! I still think about it. Because of all thAt meat, you definitely get full very quickly. I would probably share it next time, but it's so good you may not wanna share. We also go t the fries which were nice and crispy!"
,,,,,"This place was great  and although it's a bit pricey for a burger, I think it's worth it. Especially for the Bacon!"
,,,,,"Say ""YES"" to the five hour wait or get in line early! When the burgers hit the table, we all enter our own ""world of savoring.""  Best burger we've ever had--hands down, the whole family agrees. Can only vouch for burgers, fries & the great, unique cocktails. Say, ""YES!"""
,,,,,"Most expensive burger I've had no doubt but it surely was delicious. It's even better when you add the runny egg and peppered sweet savory thick bacon. The fries were crispy and the aioli was perfect. My only minor complaint is that the patties were slightly overly salty and dry. The balance of flavors and textures was great. Overall, I give it a 9/10. Now my wife didn't like it very much, she gave it a 6/10. She doesn't like pickles so without the acidity to counter balance the fattiness, it was overly oily and it was too much after a few bites. She said she's still hungry but she doesn't want to take another bite of her burger. I had to finish her burger and I tasted what she was talking about and I agreed. So if you eat the burger the way it's designed, it'll a great burger but take out something and it might not be a pleasant experience for you."
,,,,,Best burgers in town! Definitely gives you that nostalgia for a classic Chicago-style McD burger.
,,,,,"What an amazing burger. The cheese is so perfectly gooey, the chives and egg give a crispy and creamy texture to the burger, the bacon is cut generously and it is GOOD, the burger patties are perfectly seared and seasoned, and the pickle tops it all off.  Let's get to it:"
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,"The burger is perfection.  It's expensive. it gives you 1 more patty than you realize (single gives you 2 patties, double gives you 3. not sure why). The bacon is absolutely a must have.  The egg was a nice cherry on top.  The buns were buttered and toasted perfectly. I did not want to waste a single bit of this burger.  I highly recommend the wings as well! They were very tasty."
,,,,,Service: 3/5
,,,,,"It was so busy (pre covid) that we had to wait 1.5 hrs and then wait for our server and wait some more for refills etc.  It's just that busy.  Word to the wise, go at a weird hour (like 3:30 PM) to avoid the lines.  Or better, go to small cheval!  The burger is worth it trust me."
,,,,,Ambiance: 4/5
,,,,,It's a bar.  It has tables and a bar space.  It's packed and loud.  Not a first date spot but definitely one to hit up for a good burger.
,,,,,"All in all, I want to give this place a 5/5 because the food is just that good. It's a must have. Please check it out :)"
,,,,,"Of course everyone mentioned Au Cheval when researching places to eat in Chicago. Naturally it was on my Chicago eats list. Wait was quoted over an hour and we didn't have a reso. Small place, people standing everywhere... we enjoyed exploring the area while we waited. Thankfully we got a text sooner than the quoted time and were sat at the bar top to eat. Our server was nice, sarcastic.... yet funny, and helpful with the menu."
,,,,,"Of course we ordered a single cheeseburger with fried egg and the bacon, the fried house made bologna sandwich (by recommendation from the server), and French fried.  First off, so much food. I was stuffed early haha. Burger was really great and surprisingly the bologna sandwich was pretty darn good. The only bummer was the fries. They tasted very strange... So we didn't end up eating them."
,,,,,"In and out fairly quickly. Decent spot, but I was over hyped on the place so it was a little underwhelming. Would definitely come back to give some other items a try if ever in the area of one."
,,,,,"Well, I finally made it here to have their renowned cheeseburger.  Granted, it was a carryout order eaten in the car right after receiving off the grill, but t'was still great to try this burger given the Chicago cult following it has.  Thanks to Chicago cool girl Melanie B for also giving me all the good and handy Au Cheval carryout tips, and turning on my light bulb about even doing a carryout order from here.  As far as their double pattied cheeseburger - I render it 4 Yelp stars.  Don't get me wrong, it was a great burger, but the value side of me can't give it 5 stars mostly due to pricing.  Granted, Au Cheval is in the hip and high rent Fulton Market district, and the pricing is thus understandable.   But $13.95 ($15.56 after tax) for just a cheeseburger with no fries is on pricey side.  This burger was a delicious medium and a little on the greasy side, but no biggie, just an observation.  Taste and quality wise, there are several burgers to me that can be rated right up there with this one (Bad Apple and Kumas Corner come to mind), but Kumas Corner Belmont still wins overall in my mind ($14 for a great, big, quality burger with a generous side of fries) for an overall burger experience.  The other relevant factor with any Au Cheval burger experience is the hassle factor with simply getting into this place, which is why I never bothered with the 2-3 hour wait, much as I wanted to have a dine-in burger here.  I can tell it would be a cool experience though.  When I picked up the order, I actually exclaimed out loud to the attendant there - ""OMG, is this the whole place!?!""  Being an engineer by training, I was thinking the ratio of this place's renown to physical capacity was extremely high, and probably the highest I've ever seen!  No wonder there's a typical 2-3 hour wait here, ha!  I counted maybe six 4-seater booths/tables and maybe 10 bar stool seats, and that's it!  As far as pro tips for carryout, should you be interested, ordering on your smartphone is quick and easy, and a carryout takes only about 20 minutes (mine only took about 13 minutes as I ordered right at their noon opening and was order #2).  Bring a knife and napkins, as they do charge $0.75 for such, and that's clearly shown on the order menu if you want them.  Their online ordering becomes available right at opening hour, not a minute before, just fyi.  I don't know about parking tips around there, you just have to look around, and spots nearby open up.  Overall, a fun foodie stop at a Chicago institution, even if just for carryout."

,,,,,Update 10/13/2020 
,,,,,"A representative of Au Cheval reached out today apologizing for the incident and informed me that the office manager of Au Cheval has given me a full refund. While it shouldn't have ever happened, I'm pleased with the customer service I finally received.  "
,,,,,______________________________________________________________
,,,,,"They charged my card to the wrong order. I was overcharged by $40 because of the current system they are using due to COVID-19. When paying our bill, I was directed to manually pay for low contact purposes, I had no issue with that.  I received an itemized receipt of the correct meal with the correct total via email. I later checked my bank account, and I was overcharge by $40. When I reached out to Au Cheval, they informed me that the receipt the restaurant sent me did not exist, and that my card was charged to another tables order. Au Cheval sent the receipt that matched their records, and it was not what I had ordered. When I showed the restaurant proof of what I ordered, they all together stopped replying to my emails. Extremely disappointed in this customer service."
,,,,,"Alright y'all, let me say I refuse to pay more than $5 for a burger and that if I had to choose my favorite burger place, it'd be in n out. BUT TRUST ME when I say this was the best $15 I've spent on a burger. "
,,,,,| l o c a t i o n |
,,,,,"The restaurant is small and a bit cramped especially if you're sitting at the bar area (but you get a great view of the cooking). It has old diner vibes with brick walls, hanging lights, and open kitchen but is also dimly lit."
,,,,,My friend and I came on a weeknight around early dinnertime and were lucky enough to be seated right away! 
,,,,,| f o o d |
,,,,,SINGLE BURGER (5/5): Actually comes with 2 patties and added a fried egg on top. IT WAS GLORIOUS. The patties were so juicy - beautifully cooked and seasoned. The buns were toasted perfectly and the garlic aioli spread tied everything together perfect. SIMPLICITY. AT. ITS. FINEST. 
,,,,,| t l ; d r |
,,,,,"Burger is THICC, juicy, and worth the hype. No-frills. The epitome of quality over quantity!! But I honestly wouldn't wait 1-2 hours for it. I recommend coming on a weekday if you can to cut the wait times."
,,,,,"This isn't an every day restaurant for me because the way takes a while usually and I go into a serious food, afterwards, but it is worth it for a special treat. Best bacon ever!"
,,,,,This was an amazing burger! The crispy fries were good as well. The service was good but just be prepared for at least a 30 min wait but it'll be worth it.
,,,,,Great Food!  People do like to hang here so the wait times are extended but this is my favorite Burger!  Wish they would put one in the Western suburbs.
,,,,,Au Cheval it's the best when it comes to burgers I would eat there at least three times a week if I could!! There are OTHER items that I STILL need to try but I can't get past the burgers!!!! They are EXCELLENT!!!!. Every time!!! I've never never had a bad burger they're always excellent juicy & tender!!
,,,,,"OK.. let me start by saying that the place was PACKED!! If I was claustrophobic!!??! I wouldn't have survived!! However, I was told that I would be seated in 45 minutes...and I was. I had to sit at the bar but it was cool. I was by myself since the wife was out of town. Anyway, the waiter that served me was named ""Brandon""(..I told 'em I'd remember..). His service was very good. Asked what I wanted...and delivered with kindness. ..can't ask for more. He asked me what I wanted to drink, I had a Coke with Cherry Juice(, or Grenadine..) I turned around and it was in front of me!!! The bartender was listening and prepared the drink for me before I could breathe!!!..AWESOME. Her name is ERIN!!!  AWESOME job!!!... OK, I had a Single Cheeseburger topped with a Fried Egg..with Bacon on the side. I kinda expected what I was getting. Their ""Single"" is more like a ""DOUBLE"" Cheeseburger!!...and I said what God said after he created the earth..."" It was Good.."" ... OMG The BURGER WAS DA BOMB!!!! My waiter(Brandon) stopped and asked me,"" How's your burger""?... I just looked at him. I was trying to find the words...all I could do is raise my eyebrows and nod my head...and all I can say is the burger was SO good!!!...and I plan on going back to have another one. I had the butter& bread pickles for the appetizer. I completely enjoyed my experience...the ONLY thing is that they could use a inch more space!!... I told the people sitting next to me this place is like Kuma's Korner minus the decibels...MAYBE even a step ahead with the flavor of the burger...BUT definitely minus all the volume....If they had a LITTLE more ROOM I'd give 'em Six stars!!!"
,,,,,"I am not a burger girl, but I love this place. The cheeseburger is out of bounds and with the fries and aioli - chefs kiss! This was my first time inside dining and it is small and intimate. I went here for an anniversary and it was cool, casual, with great food. Great service too."
,,,,,I stand by the claim that this is one of the best burgers in Chicago. I've been to the actual restaurant before which tends to be a long wait but is so worth it. I regularly crave their bacon. It's an expensive add-on but honestly the best bacon I've ever had. The fries are good too.
,,,,,A watch out for ordering on door dash - the single burger comes with two patties and the double burger comes with three patties.. 
,,,,,So so good! I love this place.
,,,,,I've gotten take out once and most recently dined in for my birthday. The service was absolutely amazing as was the food & drinks! Our waitress took such good care of us and the atmosphere was great. I highly recommend Au Cheval
,,,,,Ok I finally see what the hype is all about. I have to admit this is one of thr best and memorable Burgers we've had in America! If you come to Chicago this is a MUST!!! Service was incredible too.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"I don't know if it's the BEST BURGER in town ... But it's definitely one of the best...Lol I don't eat burgers as often so it will be highly unfair for me to judge this place based solely on burgers, but YES it was a good tasting burger sandwich  haha. "
,,,,,"So I was told about AU-CHAVEL by one of my uber drivers, She was so excited to tell me about this place and how EVERY man in her life Loves her for taking them to this burger joint. "
,,,,,She mention that the wait is long on weekends but the food is Amazing. 
,,,,,"So I took her word and took my guy on a Tuesday and it was PACKED, even though we were seated almost right away. "
,,,,,"We both order the burger, No bacon and no egg which we kinda regretted that we went the  no egg route since, know AU-CHAVEL.. (But anywho...) and an order of fries."
,,,,," It is a small space, The ambiance is very cozy, Loud music with romantic vibes. "
,,,,,"Our waiter was very friendly and explained us the menu perfectly, Was attentive and prompt. "
,,,,,We will definitely be back!
,,,,,Your dream of what you want your last burger and fries to be on earth. 
,,,,,"The double fried fries, the garlic aioli dipping sauce, the decadent burger with complex toppings and big pork belly along with brioche bun, just makes this amazing. "
,,,,,I hope this can be a bucket list place for out of  towners or a regular for those in Chicago.
,,,,,This place is the best burger option in the world. It offers a simplistic smashed patty done up. Thank you au cheval for your greatness.
,,,,,Will never be coming back.  They will not take cash and you have to upload your own payment on your phone.  So if I'm going to collect money for you technically I work for you.   Where's my paycheck!
,,,,,Thanks but no thanks.
,,,,,Ps
,,,,,Burger was ok way over priced fries were not that good and at $7 an order should have knocked my socks off.
,,,,,Ps
,,,,,"I get the hype. The wait on a Friday wasn't terrible at 11AM but I had to wait for my party so as time passed, it definitely got busy and the line went out the door in a February winter. Staff is friendly though and attentive. Their Bloody Mary, should you have to wait, is on point with many ingredients."
,,,,,Okay for the staples... the au cheval burger w bacon was tender and delivered. The fried bologna sandwich was good but not great - and I actually really like bologna  (boars head). Both sure are greasy but that's what you came for. The fries are a perfect side.
,,,,,Hands down on of the best burgers I have ever had.
,,,,,"Expensive, but way worth it, it's a GIANT burger and the bacon is easily another patty.  I can't tell you that anything specifically made the burger amazing, other than, everything made it amazing.  Great patty, nice pickles, wonderful bread, etc."
,,,,,"I went to Au Cheval back in 2016 and remembered it being the best burger I've ever had. I've talked about it for years - and finally had the chance to bring my husband for the first time this summer. I was nervous I had built it up in my head and oversold it - but that was not the case. It was just as delicious as I remembered, and my husband was pleasantly surprised - he was convinced I was exaggerating haha. We got there right when they opened and were seated immediately. Our server was kind and funny, and the service was quick! We each got the single burger (which actually has two patties) with the egg and bacon of course. SO. GOOD. Can't wait until our next trip to Chicago - we'll definitely be back."
,,,,,"Tried Au Cheval based on some local reviews and this spot did not disappoint. We had the single burger with bacon and fries on the side. Everything about the burgers were delicious and they were filling. The fries were tasty as well. We also had a couple of cocktails that were definitely strong but went down easy. On top of that, the service was quick, efficient and top notch. We were able to pay on our phones to make the processes even easier. We would definitely recommend giving them a try if you are in the area, highly recommend."
,,,,,"We arrived right when they opened on a Saturday morning and there was no wait! We ordered the Au Cheval burger with the bacon, ham sandwich, and the root beer float. Honestly, the root beer float was the highlight of the meal! The burger and the ham sandwich were good but nothing to write home about unfortunately. I think we may have hyped up the burger in our heads after all the videos and reviews we saw!! The ham sandwich was unbelievably light and almost felt like we were eating air if that's possible, the food just kept evaporating in our mouth haha. Total for the bill was over $50 which was quite steep for what we thought we could get somewhere else. Overall not bad and glad we tried it once, but probably wouldn't go back again (esp if there's a long wait)!"
,,,,,"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT, best burger ever also very good bone marrow."
,,,,,The burgers are so good! Also another must try is the root beer floats! Can't wait to go back! 
,,,,,Also make sure to be willing to wait a bit to get a table
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This place was very good! The burger definitely lives up to the hype. The Garlic Aoli was marvelous!! Some of the best I've ever had! Definitely worth getting the fries for it. The wait wasn't bad if you are willing to sit outside, we were only waiting for around 20-30 minutes. But it was all worth it. Definitely had to unbutton my pants to keep eating at this one! So filling. Delicious!"
,,,,,Contrary to popular opinion... 
,,,,,this place is overhyped. 
,,,,,I said it 
,,,,,"The burgers and fries were far too salty... and this is coming from someone who is obsessed with salty food. I will say that if it hadn't been so salty, I think I would have actually really enjoyed the burger."
,,,,,"Went in for a late dinner one night while I was working in Chicago and had a friend visiting... It was probably around 9/10pm on a weeknight and there was probably a 20 min wait to be seated. I was prepared as I'd heard that there probably would be. Let me say now- COMPLETELY WORTH IT!! My friend and I split a double cheese burger with egg, general Janes honey fried chicken, and crispy fries. We ordered wine & beers to go with and were very happy with our food and drink. The ambiance was sooo cool as it was darker, with loud music, and we were seated at the bar watching our food being prepped! Definitely a spot to check out!"
,,,,,"Okay, here's the thing. The burger is f*cking good, like- 11/10 good. Like, I sent a picture of the burger, half-eaten, to my boss back in California with the text, ""This is my two week notice,"" kind of good. The ""I'm on Zillow right now and just updated my resume on LinkedIn,"" kind of good. But that's not at all! That could've been it, but no! Because the service? The kind customer care? The ambiance? You absolutely will not and CAN NOT get this in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles- no. Don't even try looking, take it from a California native. This Midwest shit is incomparable. Before I could even take a bite of the big, juicy, crisp pickle wedge they graciously paired with my burger, I was already drooling as I watched a f*cking Sears Tower replica of pastry and cream being assembled right before my eyes. I could get raunchy about their mille-feuille, but I'll spare you the dirty details. Maybe we looked like tourists, maybe we acted like it, but I don't think so. I think this kindness and attention to detail is pure and genuine and cured my daddy issues. I canceled my appointment with my therapist tomorrow because I now have memories of their garlic aioli to help me through my seasonal depression. I'm not bullsh*tting. Try it for yourself and fall into a love that will never let you down, never leave you lonely, and never turn you away. This place is f*cking good."
,,,,,"One of the best burgers in town. Depending on when you check it out, I may be impossible to get a seat. If you haven't checked it out yet, Small Cheval is a great option, just less of frills."
,,,,,This might be the most difficulty I've ever had assigning a rating. 
,,,,,Quick Summary:
,,,,,Food: 5-star.  Quite possibly the best burger I've ever had. 
,,,,,Service 5-star.  Service was lightening quick and very professional.  
,,,,,Value: 1-star. Insanely Expensive.
,,,,,"Comfort and decor: 2-star.  The restaurant looks great, but it is a very small and cramped space.  We were packed-in like sardines "
,,,,,Full Review: 
,,,,,"On Friday December 27, 2019, I walked in Au Cheval at 10:45 a.m. and it was already packed!!  A party of four right in front of me was given a 30-minute wait estimate and decided to leave. I snagged one of the last seats at the counter.  The restaurant is small.  I'm estimating seating for 16 at the counter.  The restaurant has a few tables but mostly booths, which I'm estimating can seat 46. But the booths are small and four per booth would be tight. So all-in I'm guessing approximately 62 people can snugly dine at any one time.  "
,,,,,I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  It comes with a pickle spear. I did not order a side.  An interesting side-note:  as I type this the woman next to me is eating her pickle spear with a fork and knife. I've never seen that before. 
,,,,,"My burger was delicious!  Possibly the best burger I've ever had.  Unfortunately, it comes with a hefty price tag.   $31 and change for a cheeseburger and a beer is insane!  With tip it came to over $37!   They serve breakfast, but everyone I saw was having a burger.   "
,,,,,"Be forewarned: if you are a large person (which I am not), you will likely be pressing-up against someone or something the entire time you are in here.  This  is very tight quarters.  "
,,,,,By the time I left (11:10 am) the line was out the door!  
,,,,,"Long lines, tight quarters, and heavy prices, all impact my rating.  Which is unfortunate, because the burger was awesome.  I've been wanting to come here for a long time, and I'm glad I finally did; but doubt I'll be back anytime soon."

,,,,,Have read all the hype for a long time and finally had the chance too try the place. Overall 3.5 stars that I rounded down to 3 stars...with an easy fourth star in the wings. Let me explain.  
,,,,,"We did takeout which methinks is problematic in colder weather.  We ordered ahead and picked it up exactly when told to. The hamburgers were routinely very good, but the special sauce and nice cheese just melted into the (what was originally a very nice) bun to make a goopy mess. The fries (2 stars) were probably nice at first but were coolish when we got them. One burger had the bacon (5 star bacon absolutely the best, fresh tender and tasty). Two burgers had the fried egg which came in a plastic container to keep it together,  but ended up a bit rubbery and just 2 stars. "
,,,,,"So in total 3 stars. Now we think eating in would immediately put it up to 4 stars because everything would be fresh and hot and not ruin the bun. TO GO didn't work for us, but we'll return to sit in one day. Employees were tip top."
,,,,,It took too long for my order and the customer service was abysmal. I waited for 45 minutes and the food was average at best. Not worth the time or small fortune I paid.
,,,,,Au cheval is a without a doubt MUST GO TO when you're visiting Chicago. This is hands down the best burger I've ever had. I've been to and tried a lot of strictly burger/speciality burger restaurants and Au Cheval has them all beat. 
,,,,,Be prepared as you will more than likely have to wait. When I visited we had a 45minute wait but it's in a nice area with other shops you can walk to and see. Our wait was capped off with members of the Chicago bears leaving the restaurant. 
,,,,,"Back to the food. The burger it self is seasoned and buttery and juicy. You don't even need the egg to add to the richness because it's so good. My fiance and I however weren't crazy about the fries, their only let down. Service, atmosphere, burger(and their crispy dill pickle, a must for all burgers imho) was all fantastic and is getting them the 5 stars. You. Need. To. Go."
,,,,,"simply put, over rated, not worth the wait or the price. definitely not the best burger in chicago. Though its not a bad burger, it was a disappointment.  Your paying for the hype and the experience."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,The single cheeseburger with bacon and egg is DELICIOUS! Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had! The wait was long but sitting at the bar was a shorter and wait and in my opinion better being able to see all the action and how well they all work together preparing! Excited to visit the New York location!
,,,,,AMAZING. The best burgers in Chicago. Their french fries are amazing with the aioli. It has a longer wait so make sure you get there early!
,,,,,The Single Cheeseburger was as good as I remember.  One bite and the muscles relax.  The stress oozes out of the body to be replaced by comfort and joy. The only thing I want to forget at Au Cheval is the price...
,,,,,I came to Au Cheval with the single minded objective of the double patty Single Cheeseburger.  The pictures I saw and the reviews I read left me yearning.  It's like after Tony Stark saw Natasha headscissors Happy to the mat.  I want one.
,,,,,"This was a pre-pandemic visit, when the crowds were unbearable and you wished you had the Infinity Stones.  I ordered the Single with bacon and egg options.  The waiter didn't ask how I wanted the burger but it arrived medium just as I like it."
,,,,,"The first bite tells me I have something special in hand with no single ingredient overpowering any other but all working together in a well orchestrated symphony.  Each bite is different despite the apparent homogeneity.  Savory, peppery, sweet, spicy. tart, gooey, crunchy, eggy, beefy.  The palate anticipates what the next taste and texture sensation will be.  The bun to ratio is perfect passing the no think test. It does fall short my beefiness scale.  The patties are dainty and I wished the burger came with more beastly patties.  The bacon is otherworldly.  Sweet, smoky, peppery, hearty, bacony, and with great mouthfeel.  It's best bacon I've had and its meant to be eaten standalone."
,,,,,"I recommend the Au Cheval Single Cheeseburger without reservation, but it's not No. 1 on my burger list.  That distinction resides with a burger in Portland."
,,,,,"Best burger in Chicago! The fries are excellent with their garlic dipping sauce. I always get the single cheeseburger and fries, next time I need to try the bone marrow appetizer - I've seen other people get it and it looks delicious!"
,,,,,Parking can be tough (it just snowed a bunch) but well worth it. This was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The single cheeseburger is actually two patties and was plenty of food. Service was quick and they had very good COVID measures in place as well. It's not a huge menu but quality was top-notch!
,,,,,"I added bacon to my burger and would recommend, it's really thick! Their ranch was fantastic as well if you are needing a side for your fries."
,,,,,I ate here Wednesday around 3:30 on a total
,,,,,"whim! It was 72 degrees and the outdoor tent was mostly empty so I decided it was a great time to tick something off my bucket list. Service was fast and the COVID safety measures were great. Here's the only thing: the famous burger really isn't that great. I ordered the single with egg and bacon and although the burger was tasty, it definitely wasn't worth the $29 I paid. It just tasted like a decent burger, nothing mind blowing (The bacon was incredible though). That said you should probably check this place out just so you can say you had the supposed best burger in Chicago"
,,,,,"It's a good burger. Solid for sure. The bacon is thick and tasty. Definitely get the burger if you go here. West loop right off Halsted, usually pay parking hard to find during peak times. "
,,,,,During covid has outdoor seating and easy pickup options. Staff is friendly and pickup is quick and safe. 
,,,,,"If you go here, you must get the burger. My second favorite was the fried chicken wings. "
,,,,,Chilaquiles and the duck gravy hash were  average I thought. 
,,,,,Get the burger (and the chicken wings if need more) and you will be happy!
,,,,,The single burger was really filling (single has two patties). I usually eat a decent amount but a single burger with bacon was decently filling.
,,,,,"Amazing food! I was seriously almost in tears over how good it was. They were very accommodating towards people with celiacs, such as myself, and they were able to make everything I order gluten-free. The service was great and our waiter was extremely nice. Someone else at my table ordered the bone marrow and it just melted like butter when you took a bite. I've never had a burger as good as this one and I didn't even know that they could taste this good. This is definitely a place you should try if you're in Chicago but be prepared to never want to eat anyone else's burger again."
,,,,,The burger is good but the bacon is what makes it for me. The bologna sandwich was also tasty. The place is on the pricier side for what it is. Would go back on occasion.
,,,,,"Honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. Cool vibe, great service & really reasonable prices! You can't go wrong here!"
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Best burger in Chicago (get it with the egg on top)
,,,,,Bone marrow is 10/10
,,,,,Korean wings are 10/10 
,,,,,All the appetizers are great
,,,,,This place spoiled me I swear they burgers soooooooo good that other places just all seem like they don't hit- like this place.
,,,,,"This place was highly recommended by all.  My sons and I were visiting Chicago so we felt compelled to visit.  We tried twice.  The first time was on friday night around 6:30pm.   They told us the wait was around 2-2.5hrs.  The great thing is that they take your phone number and will text you.  We waited around for 1.5hrs (no real shopping around, just restaurants).  Then left around 8pm.  I got a text about 40 mins later but we were already back at the hotel.  The next night, we went around the same time.  The hostess remembered me which was cool.  Same wait time was quoted to me.  This time, we went next door to Lone Wolf to hang out.  We got paged around 8:15pm.  I think the fact that they have out door tables helped.  But the wait is real.  However, service was fast once we got seated and food came out really fast."
,,,,,The Burger was really good.  I got it with an egg.  I loved the bun (compared with billygoat tavern).  IT was soft and moist.  The meat was amazing.  Definitely not for the health conscious.  It was fatty and juicy.  The single cheeseburger was the perfect size.  They don't mess around with veggies.  The pickle was also really good.  But what made it special was the meat and sauce.  I would definitely recommend it.  Quite different from Shake shack and In N Out.  Fries with the sauce was really good as well.
,,,,,Definitely a must try when you are in chicago.  Just head over to Lone wolf and grab a Zombie Dust while you wait
,,,,,"After years of dining at the more convenient Small Cheval, I finally made my to the glorious Au Cheval. "
,,,,,TG for Covid season because my wait was a short 30 minutes. Mainly because they have outdoor seating and implement a 90 minute dining rule.
,,,,,"SO here is a PRO TIP: a single burger is actually 2 patties and a double burger is 3 patties. I didn't know before ordering. I actually ended up with the full burger experience. I got a double with egg and bacon. Their bacon is what it looks like every photo- so sweet, so thick, so flavorful! Idk how, but there eggs are always so beautiful too! "
,,,,,"Everything is ALA Carte, so fries are separate. I got the crispy fries which comes with garlic aioli and some white cheese sauce plus another egg. Really good and crispy. Another pro tip- root beers are unlimited refills and these were a thirst quencher! Also, they had certain tallboys for $3, but for a dollar more, I was able to get a pilsner from Hopewell brewing. I love that micro based in Chicago!"
,,,,,"IMO, these place carries so much hyped but I want to confirm the hype is real. Now, I don't want to say this is the best burger in the city, but it is a competitor for that title for sure."
,,,,,"After 5 years in Chicago, I finally ate at Au Cheval (and no that's not how long the wait list was, although we did have to wait about 45 minutes on a Thursday afternoon). I got the chilaquiles which felt gluttonous even by chilaquiles standards - but hey, I think that's what you're going for at Au Cheval. They were phenomenal. My favorite part was definitely the fried tortillas, but the toppings were all fresh and tasty too. My friend got the classic single cheeseburger, which actually comes with 2 patties while the double cheeseburger comes with 3 patties. She  thought it was one of the best burgers in Chicago. I recommend - definitely worth a wait."
,,,,,"Great! Au Cheval is phenomenal! All of the food here is on fire and highly recommend! This place is a real gem to this area of Chicagoland. Their food was made to perfection, fresh, and prepared amazingly. All of the food you can see on their menu is very affordable and fair. You can literally try and order any food you want in such a reasonable price. You can save a lot of money by eating here compared going to other stores around the area. They are very convenient and nice. No wonder why many people is keep coming back over and over to grab some of their quality foods again and again. Very incredible! Their staff here is really nice, friendly, and very accommodating. They will actually greet you once you entered the place, show you a big warm smile, and even assist you to the vacant and perfect spot. This place is full of awesome staff and managers. Full of fresh and phenomenal foods. Really amazing place to visit and spend some quality time with your special someone. Perfect spot for group of friends that wants to hangout, family that will going to have a bonding, couples that wants to date, and even just to treat yourself and relax. Au Cheval is incredibly nice place. Thank you for wonderful and outstanding customer service! I will come back again soon! Thank you for awesome experience! Will recommend your place to all the people I know. Thank you Au Cheval! Keep up the good work! Cheers! Well done!"
,,,,,"I've waited months to try this place. The wait here is usually 1-3 hours depending on the time and place. We slid by at around 7PM on a Monday so we were met with an hour wait but DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU, there's a dope brewery a few doors down that you can chill at while you wait."
,,,,,Let me start by saying this is the best burger in Chicago and top 5 I've ever had in my life. I had the double and added an egg too it. My group and I also split the extra side of bacon (must have) and the bone marrow(would recommend). The bacon here isn't bacon - it's real ass pork belly cooked to perfection. I added a few strips to my burger and my mouth just watered typing this up lol.
,,,,,We didn't grab any cocktails because burgers should be eaten with beers so we grabbed some cheap PBR tall boys since they were so cheap! Like 3ish dollars or something which is unheard of in West Loop.
,,,,,The service here was great. Our server was always coming to our table and taking care of us and he accommodated one complex burger order. We also forgot a bag behind us and the restaurant called us to pick it up! They kept our bag instead of selling it on craigslist.
,,,,,"Overall - this is a must go to. Don't even think about being scared of the line. Put your name down, go have a few drinks, and come back when they call you. 11/10."
,,,,,"Famished, we went straight to Au Cheval after dropping off our bags at the hotel.  Some of our friends still hadn't made it, and we opted to get in the waitlist without them since Au Cheval requires the entire party to be there to be waitlisted.  The greeter was very accommodating and gracious and gave us the idea to split the party further to get seated faster (since we were already so keen on sacrificing the latecomers).  So we took the option (still had to wait a bit) and it was totally worth it.  Probably the best burger I've had in the U.S (ordered with the bacon and egg).  Bun was picture and texturally perfect.  Right amount of fluff, butter and size.  Beef patty was a perfect medium rare with great flavoring.  Bacon was pretty much just a large slab of pork belly and was a flavor explosion.  Beware: A single is actually a double patty.  I ordered a bologna sandwich thinking I was getting a true single and couldn't finish it.  Second warning: Don't get the bologna sandwich, it's not special.  Stick with the burger with the bacon and egg.  We sat outside on a summer day and there were a few wasps trying to steal bites of our food."
,,,,,Lives up to all the hype. Best burger in the city and it's not even close. Worth the every minute of wait time there is.
,,,,,"Yes the Burgers are good,get there early and still prepare to wait,, all good things require patience,try the house made Lemonade  and the drinks are free refills so keep them coming (soda,lemonade).The wings are great to if some reason you go to a Burger place and don't eat burgers"

,,,,,"So I left a previous rating of 5 stars on Au Cheval and I stand by that. This last experience there was one of the worst dining experiences I had this year and I go out to eat at least 5 times a week. So we ordered the Double Cheeseburger and the General Jane's Chicken to go as that was the only option given Chicago's current health order. The take out experience was the exact opposite of the great experience I have had dining in. We ate our food outside in their canopy which had a heat lamp in it over like a container. The take-out containers they use are not good. Double Cheeseburger wrapped in tin foil did not hold the heat well, and the cheeseburger itself tasted like a 5 guys burger (no disrespect to 5 guys). The burger simply does not hold up as takeout and was much more dry than usual. For the General Jane's Chicken we were provided with no napkins or silverware. Having grown up in inner city Cleveland, I am use to using my arm as a napkin from time to time, but given the stickiness/sauce of the chicken I was not looking to do that."
,,,,,"Now is when the fun begins. My brother was getting ready to open a White Claw he bought at a store and a lady jumped out to say if he did that ""we would have to eat elsewhere"". He obliged and I asked her for napkins and silverware. The look I received was like I was asking her for a kidney. We got that and were having our meal talking with our friend. The chicken still held up and was probably about 75% as good as it normally is, but at 100% it is among the best chicken I have had. As we are finishing our food and vacating the canopy another lady who works there asks us ""Are you done?"" in one of the ruder tones I have experienced. As someone who has served tables before and working in restaurants in front and back of the house, I have never been so disrespectful to someone. There was no need for the tone/attitude of their servers/managment and I was incredibly disappointed by them. With everything going on in the world and with the pandemic its not the end of the world if the food isn't as good in takeout vs at the restaurant, but treating people with little decency is not right. I am sure I will eat at Au Cheval again, but the taste left in my mouth by the servers & management can't be washed out by a delicious burger. Do better Au Cheval"
,,,,,"I went here with my girlfriend on a Saturday around 9:45 PM and it was about a 90 minute wait to get in. Went to the bar next door and had a few drinks. Small, dimly lit diner with great music on. We bellied up to the bar and got pretty quick service. Great diverse beer selection."
,,,,,We ordered the General Jane's chicken and the cheeseburger. We both enjoyed the chicken the most of the 2 dishes. General Tso/Asian Sesame   flavor on the sauce with a Korean double fry on the chicken. The crisp taste of the chicken with the asian sauce was an excellent combination. Burger was excellent although not the best I have ever had in my life as many have claimed. Watching the kitchen staff make the burgers is a work of art with the speed and assembly line precision that they execute at. I enjoyed the bun and the sauce on the burger the most. 
,,,,,Overall very good experience and something I would recommend for a nice date night or for an out of towner to check off their bucket list.
,,,,,"Not the first time, certainly not the last, but slightly less wow factor than my first time here years ago. It's a Chitown staple, landmark, dare I say tourist trap? With ridiculous wait times, it might be hard to justify if you've had it before. What I do know is that it'll certainly be one of the best burgers you've had. I can't say it's the best, but you won't be disappointed that's for sure. It's hard to label being the best and live up to that type of hype for anything. But what I can say is that everything about it makes a pretty great burger. I do feel like the star of it is the added bacon which you should definitely get a side of or at the very least add it to the burger. That bacon is the type of crack you can support from your local dealer. Get it you won't regret it. The burger is balanced and hefty, especially if you go for the double(3 patties), which will fulfill any glutenous desire of yours. Nothing gets lost and you taste every flavor profile that it has to offer. "
,,,,,"But the real star at this place is the duck heart hash. This is my winner. This is what i'd come back here for over and over. It's a textural art piece with a flavor explosion that will definitely make you eat more than you should. Overly crunchy hash smothered with a heavy dose of country style thiccc heart gravy that would taste good on literally anything. Topped with a perfectly cooked sunnyside egg to add even more liquid gold richness for that artery clogging affect that i'll happily die for. I've come to the conclusion that the burger should be the star here, but its everything else that i'd come back for. "
,,,,,Stay fat mother suckers
,,,,,"Love food, cozy tight atmosphere, get reservation drinks are great as well as service"
,,,,,"This place is one of the most highly rated on Yelp so I had to give it a try. I read that they don't accept reservations and operate on a first come, first serve basis so I made sure to arrive early. We arrived 15 minutes after opening and there was already a 45 minute wait so definitely plan to come before opening time! The host was really nice and friendly when we went to put our name on the list. We ended up getting seats at the counter which was fine. We would have preferred booths, but the bird's eye view into the kitchen was really entertaining. The inside is small, but it's a really cool looking diner. Vintage touches with cozy seating. We started off with mimosas which were tasty. We got the bone marrow, single cheeseburger and crispy fries to share. The bone marrow was crazy delicious. Served with a sprinkle of sea salt on top, a hefty amount of marmalade and four thick pieces of toast. The fries were incredible too, served with an over-easy egg, cheese and aioli that was addictive. The burger was one of the best I've ever had. Make sure you add the bacon, it was thick-cut and delicious. One of the best meals we had in Chicago."
,,,,,"The food was pretty nice! I wouldn't say it blew my mind, but I can't find any faults with it. I got a single cheeseburger with the bacon and their crispy fries with mornay sauce and garlic aioli. "
,,,,,"single cheeseburger with bacon: The extra $5 to add bacon is so worth it. It's not like your normal, overly salty, thin bacon. This one is thick cut, almost like pork belly, and has a nice, roasty sweetness. The burger was juicy and flavorful. Overall, a very nice burger that won't blow your mind, but will most definitely satisfy you."
,,,,,"crispy fries: The fries were indeed crispy and light and cooked to perfection. If I were to order again, I would just get their normal fries. The egg didn't add anything and the sauces were pretty good, it just didn't wow me enough to want to order anything again. The garlic aioli tastes just like garlic with mayo and the mornay sauce is your standard cheesy sauce. "
,,,,,"Overall: I like this place! I arrived at 10:30 and there was already a line so I highly recommend that you get here early to try to get a spot. If they're fully booked I wouldn't recommend waiting in line for 30+ minutes, but if you happen to be there early or there's minimal wait, then this is a great stop for any meal of the day."
,,,,,"This is first time for me here in this area. My friend told me about this restaurant, what a great advice he gave me."
,,,,,"This place has one of the best burgers in the aria It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
,,,,,"If you're drunk, come on in. Let the grease cascade. I was looking for something healthy. Opted for an omelet, with just veggies. It was so oily. I could not eat it. My friend liked their burger, said it was delicious. But the fries they got were pale and soggy."
,,,,,Another friend got hashbrowns. Loooved them. The service was really good! Very nice. Just the food was not my cup of tea. But definitely was loved by my friends.
,,,,,This's my first time visiting Chicago.  This restaurant had a 2 hours wait time at 8 pm on a Monday evening.  So we tried again on our last day of visit for lunch. 
,,,,,We ordered Foie gras and bone marrow.  Foie gras was served with soft scrambled eggs and buttered Texas toast. It was delicious!  Bone marrow was served with sweet bread in port reduction. Our waitress is really sweet and our host was very helpful!
,,,,,"Came here on a weekday for dinner and waited just over an hour. Our original plan was to do takeout, but they said they're not doing take-out at the moment. I got the single cheeseburger, which like other reviews have mentioned, has two patties! And some fries. The burger was really good and didn't need any other sauce,  but I don't think it's anything life-changing and not something I would wait an hour for. The fries are crispy but unfortunately a little tough on the outside, and delightfully potatoe-y on the inside. They were very accommodating with allergens and gave my boyfriend a hash brown bun, which I thought was innovative! The service was great."
,,,,,"HOLY GRAIL of burgers. I will dream about this burger for the rest of eternity lol. I have no words. Go, wait the 2 hours and order the burger and crispy fries with egg and mormay sauce."

,,,,,"Burger is a classic here! Sat under a heater in the cold, food was great. A Chicago must!"
,,,,,"This place is delicious! Be prepared to wait a few if you go during peak hours but, it is so worth it. I sat at the bar and was able to see the kitchen staff prepare the food, ambiance was great and the staff was polite. I'll definitely be visiting them again."
,,,,,Our hotel was close so we were ok with the 2hr wait on a Saturday night. The restaurant is very small but intimate. Loved the music. Staff were friendly and helpful. We got the chicken and burger. Both were great.
,,,,,"I have never had a burger like an Au cheval burger.  Maaaan, it is good.  I have to get one every time I visit the Chi.  "
,,,,,"It's a smaller restaurant and the wait to get in is worth it!  The service is great and the wait to receive your food, even during dinner time, is reasonable.  "
,,,,,"That damn ""single"" buger had two medium patties cooked to perfection, some ole ooey gooey cheese, thick cut meaty bacon, an over easy egg, served on a buttery brio he bun slapped with some special kinda mayo. Oh!  And a nice, thick dill spear.  Thank goodness for the music too.  I was burning calories while eating this beauty of a burger!  You let me know what you think!"
,,,,,I have loved au cheval for a long time. Since my very first visit to Chicago in 2012. 
,,,,,"There's always so many great reviews, I didn't want to echo them. "
,,,,,But! I came back to Chicago ago this past weekend during Chicago's phase 3 of opening from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
,,,,,"They are currently only taking online orders through their website, door dash, and somewhere else I can't remember. "
,,,,,I accidentally ordered too early from their website as it shows that it's usually ready about 15-20 minutes after ordering. I tried calling and even Instagramming them telling them I wouldn't be arriving for another order. Their phone lines went straight to a pre-recorded message. And their IG handler is not in direct contact with the house all the time.
,,,,,I got there and before I could even mention it. The person that would be handing me my food asked what time it was. I told her it was 1PM. My order had been ready since 1220. She took it upon herself to tell me that they would remake my food for me so it would be fresh. Like. COME ON. HOW GOOD ARE THEY!??!
,,,,,"As always, burger and fries were delicious. I usually add an egg and bacon. But they're not offering an egg through online ordering currently. "
,,,,,"Come to au cheval. Order a burger, some bone marrow, or maybe a bologna sandwich. You will not regret it."
,,,,,Joining the rest of the Zagat list and recommending this place for the delicious burger. I would 10/10 come back for this burger. SO WORTH IT!
,,,,,Omgg the food. The drinks. Everything was very tasty. A bit pricey but totally worth every penny. They don't take reservations or take out so get there early!
,,,,,I took away a star because the wait was outrageous and the service could have been better. We waited close to over two hours to get seated but my boyfriend was determined to try this place out! Just an FYI a single cheeseburger has two patties and the double has three (see photos). Adding the bacon added great flavor!
,,,,,"Every time I've gone on the weekend, it's usually full, with a wait of an hour to an hour and a half. We went on a Thursday at 5 p.m. and were seated soon, which was a pleasant surprise. We are, however, always willing to wait and drink at another pub till our turn comes. The burgers here are among of the best I've eaten in the neighborhood; they're traditional burgers done exceptionally well."
,,,,,"Great food, great service, STRONG Drinks. Close to the United Center so great for a pregame meal."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Too hyped. Too expensive. It's good, but not worth the money. Also, there were parts of the burger wherein it was salty. I tried their root beer float as well and idk, I just did not like it. Maybe it wasn't as carbonated as I expected it to be? I went to the small cheval before and for some reason I preferred it there. Still try it though if you want to try the hype."
,,,,,"I always dreamed about my first Au Cheval experience. The elusive burger joint that is so difficult to get into. I envisioned myself comfortably sitting in one of their worn leather booths and taking in the sight of a burger with thicc slab of bacon, a perfectly fried egg, and a sprinkling of chives. "
,,,,,Cue a year later. My first time eating Au Cheval was the exact opposite of my dream but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way! Peak COVID was finally trying Au Cheval take out and eating it outside a random office building in the middle of Chicago winter. There was something that felt so right about eating a take out burger on a bench outside an office lobby while the security guard looked on with a puzzling look. The fierce Chicago winter could not deter from the sheer enjoyment of eating perfection in the form of a burger. 
,,,,,"First - the meat. Be warned that a ""single"" is actually a double here and a ""double"" is a triple! The patties were thinly pressed and with a light pink center and crisped edges. The cheese! The cheese complemented the meat with their melty goodness and held everything together neatly. The THICC bacon. What a differentiator. The bacon was an absolute flavor bomb that brought this burger to the next level. All of these ingredients were compressed neatly inside a buttery pillow of a bun. Despite eating this outside and in take out foil, the burger held up nicely and didn't messily fall apart. All in all, the hype was real - I'm a believer! I look forward to returning one day for the full dine in experience!"
,,,,,"Tasty ! The fries and the aioli sos , fresh pickles and juicy burgers "
,,,,,You have to try it for yourself
,,,,,"This one absolutely lived up to the hype! Considered one of the best burgers around, but the fries might actually be underrated."
,,,,,"The burger is perfect. Meaty, juicy, cheesy, flavorful and definitely add the fabulous bacon on top! "
,,,,,"The crispy fries with egg are unique and awesome, especially when including the moray sauce and garlic aioli. They almost steal the show, which is saying A LOT!"
,,,,,A must visit in Chicago and for any burger lover!
,,,,,"I knew Au Cheval for a long time but every time I was in west loop area, they were toooo busy. Finally, I tried it last Sunday! I arrived around 11:45 am and the waiting time was 45 minutes. Not too bad, right?"
,,,,,"We sit at an inside table. They sanitized table and chairs well between customers. I knew it because the seats were wet when I sat down, lol."
,,,,,"We ordered burger, scrambled egg w/ foie gras, and fried chicken. Overall, the seasoning is on the strong side. Order a drink~ "
,,,,,"The double cheese burger with thick cut beacon was the best. The beef patties were fresh, juicy, and savory. The thick cut beacons were crispy and chewy in a good way with pleasant sweet taste. The burger was big, I only ate half of it. Saved some room for other dishes."
,,,,,The scrambled egg was very soft with big pieces of foie gras. I liked the caramelized onions on the top a lot!
,,,,,"The general Jane's fried chicken was popular that I saw it on multiple tables. The sauce was quite specially, sweet, sour, spicy~~~~~~"
,,,,,It was a great experience. It could be awesome if the AC was cooler.
,,,,,It's Au Cheval...if you know you know and if you don't it's because you haven't been there yet.
,,,,,10/10 recommend sitting at the bar to watch the masters at work with your burger. One of the best burgers you'll have in IL. 
,,,,,Put your name on the waiting list and go grab a drink at another bar till they text you.
,,,,,Best burger and dip ever!!! We sat outside and it was perfect. Great value too. I will be taking visitors here.
,,,,,Excellent burger with great ambiance. Has a reputation for being one of the best burgers and always worth a stop if you're visiting the city.
,,,,,"It would be silly to come here and not try the burger at least once. The bacon is also excellent, but I prefer it on the side, since it overwhelms how great the burger is. Reasonably good selection of alcohol and plenty that goes well with their food."
,,,,,"We were lucky enough to get a seat without waiting! We tried a couple cocktails and the wings and the bone marrow. Highly recommend the bone marrow and the chicken was good but nothing special. The pink lemonade cocktail was a little too spirit forward for my taste. Overall a good experience, but not sure if it's worth waiting a couple hours to go. To be honest though we didn't try the hamburgers which they're famous for because we've gotten them at small Cheval before. Worth seeing if they can fit you in quickly. Bone marrow worth it!"
,,,,,"Love this place! Great vibe great food, drinks amazing and will do the job  Must try don't take my word for it come right on in.  We had to try the burger naturally. Beer burger I've had got the single patty which I must tell y'all comes with 2 patties, the double has 3. Order fries on the side. For drinks we had to try the Hemingway, an old fashion. Both were done perfectly and taste was amazing left feeling all happy. Also we got a desert mille-feuille, light puff pastry, whipped vanilla cream. Let me tell you no kidding when they say light. If I could would have eaten all of it alone lol"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Best burgers in Chicago. My husband and I always added the bacon and egg which made it perfect! Their bacon is a very thick cut and it's also juicy and full of flavor. The portions are definitely worth every dollar spent. We always shared the fries because the burgers were so big and filling that it would be impossible for us to finish the fries on our own. Also, make sure you go early and expect a wait. We usually took the train to go for lunch and didn't wait more than 20 minutes. Dinner time can be a couple hours."
,,,,,"Oh my gosh, what a revelation! I've heard so many good things and they met my expectations. Get there early to avoid long waits. We showed up on a Sunday morning at 10:45 (15 min. before opening) and were seated as part of the first round of guests. It took all my will power not to bust my gut with some of their inventive starters or a side dish, but instead I focused all my appetite on the double cheeseburger with added bacon and egg. It was divine. The way the flavors are layered takes you on complex progression with every bite. Each complements the other without overpowering anything. The beef is juicy, the cheese sharp, the egg just runny enough, the bacon thick, and the sauce creamy all in-between a buttery, toasted bun. This is the kind of burger you dream about. It was worth the trip and small wait. The bone marrow caught my eye so next time I'll spurge on a plate of bones. Oh, the french fries were exceptionally good as well but that burger almost made me forget about those."
,,,,,"The restaurant has an amazing service, staff, vibe and the food is out of this world."
,,,,,Whoever makes the food here deserves a raise. All of them. Deserves all the tips. Branden is his name I think. Food comes out perfect every time. Our friends hosts wingsgiving every year and this is the cult favorite. The champion of all the wings.  finger lickin good. FINGER LICKING GOOD!
,,,,,Looking for a place to eat foie gras  while visiting our daughter in Chicago and saw it on the menu here.  
,,,,,"We decided to try for dinner on a Tuesday around 5:30 pm and the place was already pretty full but got seated in 20 minutes.  The three of us ordered roasted bone marrow, single cheeseburger with bacon, bologna sandwich, green salad & foie gras  with scrambled eggs.   The jam came with bone marrow was super delicious.  It tasted great on a butter toasted bread just by itself.   We all loved the bone marrow.   I tasted small pieces of bologna and cheeseburger sandwiches that served on thick buns.    The burger tasted good but did not care for bologna.    Salad was good. I was very disappointed with foie gras and eggs.   The foie gras was covered with thick sauce and could not really taste the real flavor of it.   "
,,,,,"This is not the place for anyone who is on a diet.  Their food is definitely on the heavy side, however it's a good place to indulge in high calorie foods like the burgers and bone marrow once in a while.   I probably would not order foie gras again but might return for roasted bone marrow with delicious jam.    Excellent service."
,,,,,"There's nothing positive about COVID, but being able to skip the 2 hr wait felt amazing. The last time I was here, there was a long wait in the pouring rain. This time, I waited until I was 15 min away and then put my order in. This allowed me to just walk up and immediately get my food. Aces!"
,,,,,The burgers are worth the hype. But plenty large enough to share. Unless you're my 10 yr old daughter who downed one all by herself. Wowza. I ate half and couldn't get another bite in. 
,,,,,"Pro Tip: If you're eating in your car like I did, order the plastic flatware or bring your own napkins. They come with the fork and knife and they don't give them out for free."
,,,,,Excuse me while I go shower. I had burger juices and aioli sauce dripping to my elbows. I didn't realize that napkins weren't standard. Smh
,,,,,"This place was very hyped up as the best burger in America. The wait was long which was to be expected, but they text you when the table is ready. The burger was good but was a little over hyped. The chicken wings I thought were a lot better. Still a VERY good meal and would recommend trying it out if you are in the area!"
,,,,,"I just feel like this place didn't quite live up to the hype haha. Don't get me wrong it was good but it wasn't like wow I have to come here all the time kind of good. We had a burger which was a really good burger, but it didn't come with fries. How does a burger not come with fries haha. The beer we had was also good. But for one burger and two small beers we walked out paying $40. Now all that said. I think this spot was pretty good and I definitely would return. I would also recommend trying it out yourself. It just didn't quite make the five star cut haha!"
,,,,,"There's only one way to have a gourmet burger and Au Cheval did not disappoint!! The burger was plentiful for two to share or saved for later! As a matter of fact I didn't bother going to the hotel lobby to warm up, it was great cold (I don't recommend it for health & safety reasons of course), it's just that good!!!"
,,,,,"A real gem of a place, the food was cooked fresh and prepared amazingly. Other than the weird wait times for two people and the fact that it felt like I was eating in the corner of a cellar where we all had to share one LAMP- I would eat here again! The fried chicken was spicier than I'd like to admit, but the crispy fries were food from my dreams. I was in a GARLIC BUTTERY HEAVEN . I don't think this place is first date material just because you'd have to yell at each other to be able to hear what the other says, but if your date wants to be induced into a food coma, then this is definitely worth coming to!"

,,,,,"is it the best burger in america? maybe. i'd like to think i've eaten my fair share of burgers -- and the one they make here is no doubt, delicious"
,,,,,"it's huge (a single is a double), it's fresh, and the bacon is a definite must have. but our buns were on the dry side, the egg is probably not that necessary and relatively expensive for what you get"
,,,,,do i think it's worth a visit? absolutely! it's a great spot with a great vibe and it's unquestionably good
,,,,,"but if you're here with another person, maybe order just one burger and try some of the other amazing looking things on their menu. next time we're definitely trying that bone marrow and their wings"
,,,,,"it wouldn't surprise me at all if for most people, the burger is what got them in the door -- and the other stuff is what keeps them coming back"
,,,,,we will definitely be back!
,,,,,"The best burger I've had to date. Very expensive, but everything is worth it. Whenever someone comes to Chicago, I take them to Au Cheval (or Small Cheval if it's too crowded)"
,,,,,Definitely worth the hype! I honestly thought it was some fantasy restaurant based on how everyone talks about it but it's literally a small diner. Obviously with social distancing and additional outside seating. 
,,,,,"We came here on a Saturday night, we waited TWO HOURS for a table. No reservations, just first come first serve. But Randolph/Lake has a plethora of bars to go to and buy some time while waiting. "
,,,,,"The Root Beer was good, definitely tasted authentic and not like the the can root beer you're use to. It wasn't that sweet and as strong either. "
,,,,,"The burger!!!! We had single burgers (really two patties) with egg and bacon! They didn't ask what temperature you'd like the burger but we see why now. The bacon is so thick, sweet and crispy, it give the burger a kick! It had some pink but I think that's what makes it so tender. The egg was a nice flavorful addition. But the real star of the burger is the meat! Seasoned very well and literally MELTS in your mouth. I never had a burger so tender and tasteful. It's literally worth the hype! "
,,,,,"I'd recommend Au Cheval to anyone who likes burgers. But if you don't want to wait, I suggest maybe coming during the a weekday in the afternoon, maybe there aren't that busy around those times. "
,,,,,"They also are doing online, contactless payments!"
,,,,,This restaurant was so big. There are so many tables inside to dine in. They have a seating bar and long ang long tables for large of group costumer. Very casual relaxed vibes with great spacing between tables. Customers have a view into the kitchen. You can see how they prepared your order and you can smell the fragrant smell of food. 
,,,,,They have a different variety of foods and drinks in their menu. Every burger they have has a slice of  cucumber on a plate. They also have a mini knife on top of the burger. My favorite food was Generals Janes Honey Fried Chicken. You can taste the sweet honey on it and the juicyness of the chicken. Overall that was delicious. You can also try their Double Burger with bacon and egg and Im sure you definitely love it. 
,,,,,If you haven't tried it in here then you're definitely missing out.
,,,,,"This was my first time visiting Au Chevas and will probably be the last. I order a cheese burger add bacon and extra onions, fries and a bologna sandwich. Unfortunately, the forgot the bacon and I had to wait an additional 20 minutes, then they forgot the onions (the waitress thought I said no onions). After receiving the right burger my fries were cold and the bologna sandwich looked nice but wasn't tasty. I brought it to the managers attention and she apologized but didn't offer to replace the entire meal so everything would be warm. I just left and called it a night."
,,,,,Great burgers.  Best Bologna sandwich ever!!  Service is fast and friendly. 
,,,,,"Long lines to get in, but whatever."
,,,,,"When life knocks you down.... (With a 4 hour wait in line...) Come through the next morning a tad bit before it opens. So get back on that horse at Au Cheval. So after a train ride and a shorter wait for the doors to open, we are inside. Now I can definitely say you can lead us to this water and we will definitely drink it. Nicely served room temp in a high ball style glass. Not a bad way to start your morning."
,,,,,"""If you're in Chicago you HAVE to try their deep dish pizza!"""
,,,,,"Dear internet, let me tell you how good the burger here is. In my first visit to Chicago, the land of deep dish pizza (which was horribly disappointing) and hotdogs (which were actually pretty good), I came here for dinner for two consecutive nights during my weekend stay."
,,,,,"Everything about this place gives homage to the classic, the simple and the iconic - everything from the decor to the way the food is prepared. It's all just so deeply nostalgic, reminding you of all those classic diner scenes where the characters are eating a burger with a whiskey. And just so you know, the fries aren't overshadowed by the burger either, they definitely earn their position alongside it. This is the kind of place you would imagine Don Draper, from Mad Men, might come to in the modern world if he wanted a burger."
,,,,,"Next time, I have to try their bone marrow because the way the guy made it look I wished I had a third night to spend here."
,,,,,Tip: It's much easier to get seated (at the bar) if you come alone. So if you're the type to enjoy good food and your own company this is your sign to go treat yourself.
,,,,,"Decided to come last-minute based on all the amazing reviews, arrived around 9 and was told to expect a pretty long wait for a party of 3. We decided to walk around a bit and 20 minutes later our table was ready! Great start, we're only visiting Chicago for the week and this was dinner #1."
,,,,,"Based on reviews, decided to get the bone marrow, double cheeseburger w/eggs and bacon, and aioli fries. Asked if there's anything else we were missing out on and was recommended the honey fried chicken, which they were able to do a half order of!"
,,,,,"Food came out so quick, was great sitting right next to the chefs being able to watch the food come together. Burger came out first, didn't read the reviews clearly enough to realize double cheeseburger is actually 3 patties, would recommend just the single (2 patties), it's more than enough especially since the bacon is THICK. Then fries and chicken sitting in a glorious pool of sweet sauce. The bone marrow was a show stopper coming in at the end, 4 gigantic pieces with so many delicious crispy slices of toast and the best beef marmalade (like a sweet beef jam!). "
,,,,,"Truly felt like a full-on food experience, not just an average dinner. We really dug into all the food - thank goodness for the wet towels that came with the chicken. The staff was also incredibly friendly and amazing overall - whoever works Wednesday nights, thank you for an incredible experience!"
,,,,,"Consistently listed as the best burger in Chicago for a reason. You can't beat it. The fries with egg added are also to die for. Again, long waits but worth it! We went when they opened and got on the waitlist quickly. They will text you when your table is ready so you can walk around or go grab a drink deon the street if you'd like."

,,,,,"I was told by a friend that he had the bear burger of his life here. From one foodie to another, that is saying a lot. And he was not wrong. Best burger hands down. We also had the bone marrow, duck sausage hash, and a tasty desert. Cocktails where mind blowing. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"I'd heard plenty about this place, and maybe my expectations were too high. It's really nice and cozy inside, and although it can get quite loud, it's a great atmosphere. The food was mixed: the burger was quite good, but the French fries were utterly disappointing. I'd heard a lot about the fries here, and they're really nothing special. The fries with egg and cheese are better, but every thing gets a big too salty in that combo. I wish their plain fries were a little crispier and better seasoned beyond plain salt. "
,,,,,"The biggest downside here is the price: for three burgers, a regular fries, and an egg fries, we spent over $100. I get it's Chicago and all that -- but I was expecting to love the meal for that price, and it was only fine."
,,,,,I was lucky enough to be taken here while staying with some friends downtown last week. Not only was the food mind blowingly next level delicious but the service was outstanding. I could not possibly say enough kind words about my experience but I can definitively say that every time I am in your beautiful Windy City I will be visiting you again. Thank you kindly.
,,,,,Have popped into here a few times now. Wait times and parking are killer. The service is smooth and food comes out pretty quickly. The open kitchen and crowd is usually high energy. Would highly recommend the bone marrow. The burger overall is decent. Would skip the fois gras dish.
,,,,,"Rightfully named ""best cheeseburger in town"", Au Cheval's 2+ hour-long wait times can deter many from trying."
,,,,,"And while the best time *used* to be after midnight (pre-COVID) it's now only open until 10:15pm, but still worth trying to sneak a seat later in the evening to avoid the lunch or dinner rush."
,,,,,Non-cheeseburger items on the menu that you MUST try: 
,,,,,"Food: thick-cut peppered bacon (if you're lucky to be there late-night, you might even catch a fresh tray with the next day's bacon); crispy fries (with mornay sauce, garlic aioli & fried farm egg, need I say any more?); and the foie gras, which comes with scrambled eggs & toast."
,,,,,Cocktails: the bee's knees & avery gold rush.
,,,,,"Ever since I moved to Chicago, all I have heard was that I needed to get a burger from Au Cheval. Almost a year later, I finally got one! Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough, but I didn't think this burger was anything too special. I will admit it is better than the average burger. It is one of those indulgent burgers that is filled with everything you love. It is juicy, greasy, and salty-- perhaps a little too much for my taste. Is this place worth the hype? I don't really think so, but I won't discount a good burger. It certainly is not worth the wait (which can be around 30-45 minutes during the weekday)."
,,,,,"Would give this 5 stars, only thing would be the extremely long wait time. I didn't mind waiting since it was just me but it was definitely worth it! Burger is a MUST. Had a nice brioche bun and meat was perfectly cooked. Fries were great as well. I would recommend visiting here while in chicago!"
,,,,,Not a hype at all. Definitely one of the best burgers that you will eat! They have a cute outdoor seating now like most restaurants on Randolph. This is mostly good because their indoor space is super tiny and the waits are long because of that. With the outdoor seating it's easier to accommodate more people.
,,,,,"Delicious food!! The fries with the aioli sauce are amazing and the burger is one of the best in the city. Our waiter, Sully, was so slay and amazing."
,,,,,"The elusive au cheval that boasts supposedly the best burger in America. Last time i tried to wait in line for it, the wait was 4 hours long. This time, i was able to snag a doordash delivery. Keep in mind, their delivery apps might not always be available. I had to try several times over a period of 2 days to finally be able to order. "
,,,,,"We ordered the double cheeseburger , fries, and the kfc (korean fried chicken). I did not add the egg or the bacon on the cheeseburger and I think that's probably where I went wrong. It was a good burger. That's really about it. I'm about to say something that may be offensive to you burger peoples. It taste almost like a Big Carl's from Carls Jr. I LOVE the big carl because it's no frills , large patty and gooey cheese. Just like the au cheval burger. No frills and delicious. While I really didn't have anything negative to say about the burger, i probably wouldn't be back since I can find a similar alternative for a tenth of the price. Maybe if I added the egg or bacon, my opinion would differ."
,,,,,"The fries were mediocre, but of course they would be if they were delivered. The aioli sauce it came with was delicious though! The fried chicken....was also good. I've had better. "
,,,,,"Overall, I don't think you'll be disappointed with your dining experience here. However, on this episode of is it worth the hype? The answer is no."

,,,,,"Arrived 11:30 am on Saturday with patio seating and no wait, though my friend had to wait for me to cross the street before checking in which was a little weird since I was in sight 30 feet away."
,,,,,"The burger flavors were great, bacon is a must with really tastefully peppered sweet fat. Also highly recommend the egg!"
,,,,,"Hash browns were very crispy on top, texture was great."
,,,,,"Both burgers and hash browns were beautiful in presentation, especially out on the patio with the sunlight. 4/5 though because while the flavors were good, everything was under salted. And then one random bite of hash brown was incredibly salty."
,,,,,"Definitely could be a 5/5, maybe I just got unlucky with the salt"
,,,,,"I finally figured out why people like this place so much. And this was my 5th visit here. All times sitting at the bar, but this time, I was paying attention to the cooks behind the counter."
,,,,,"Let's start off with the burger guy. He slaps on several patties on the grill meticulously placing them in a neat square arrangement. Here's where the good stuff comes in. He sprinkles on a couple shakes of salt, then a couple more...then oh...a 3rd shake of salt. How much salt does this piece meat already need. That's ok, because I like the salt."
,,,,,"And now the fry guy. If you don't already know...they use duck fat during the frying process. But it was such an art, when the guy kept adding more and more to the mix. I mean it could have been lard that he was adding, but either way...the more fat, the better the fries."
,,,,,"And finally that special spread the use on the burger and as a condiment for the fries. Not sure what it is, but I can tell you it has a lot of fat in it. "
,,,,,Conclusion: salt and fat are good for you.
,,,,,"This part of town is known for its food and drinks and this is no exception. The burger and fries are phenomenal. Nice and juicy, and the fries are crispy with the right amount of oil and salt on it."
,,,,,"Make sure to get your cheeseburger with some bacon on top. It takes it up another notch. I have to admit, I wasn't a fan of their special sauce with pickle spread on the bun. Scraped it off and still the burger was good by itself...plain, with just cheese, the meat and the bacon. I came here a second time, and had my cheeseburger with a fried egg on top. It's the notch above the notch."
,,,,,"Note: A single cheeseburger has two patties. Luckily I saw some people already order theirs, so if you're going for a double...well that's twice the meat. You do the math."
,,,,,I'll be back to try the bone marrow. Can this place get any better. Oh yeah...lot's of beers on tap...local and from afar.
,,,,,"Fancy place for a regular cheeseburger! Very nice seating. Super comfortable, staff maintained safety guidelines. Ate indoors, very dark and intimate.."
,,,,,"Waitress- Super friendly! Profesional, was attentive when needed."
,,,,,"Cleanliness- Up too standard, nothing out of the ordinary. "
,,,,,"Price- Not cheap, but got our money's worth!"
,,,,,"Food- Cheeseburger, was basic with their own twist. The meat was nothing to blow my socks off. The fires were amazing! Decent food to enjoy with good company maybe once every three month's... if that... overall, wasn't terrible!"
,,,,,"We had a good experience at Au Chevel, I have absolutely nothing negative too say about this place! And Don't forget to tip you waiter/Waitress!"
,,,,,Always in search of a great burger.
,,,,,Possibly found the Holy Grail.
,,,,,Single burger is a double. Double is a triple.
,,,,,Add Bacon/Add Egg
,,,,,$22 Single/$24 Double
,,,,,No fries.
,,,,,WORTH IT!
,,,,,Came in like 5 min of ordering
,,,,,"""We Mean Business"""
,,,,,"Yes, they do!!!"
,,,,,"Awesome, will come back"
,,,,,Best bacon burger I've ever had in my life. The bacon is super thick cut and the burger is to die for. I love burgers and this was a big hit!! Will definitely eat there the next time I visit Chicago.
,,,,,"Responsive and friendly staff, relatively spaced out seating arrangements, the atmosphere is contemporary & relaxing, the selection boasts an Americana-typical bar scene with a twist. "
,,,,,Convenient location for those who eat like we do; I vividly recall sweating when trying the fried bologna sandwich.  I even ordered another to go.  You won't regret coming here
,,,,,"We had about an hour and a half waiting time, we were seated outside and the staff is pleasant. & honestly they serve one of the best burgers I've had!!! The meat, the egg, the bacon, it just all goes so well together. I really wished I could eat this every week. It's a must-stop every time I visit."
,,,,,The was a good burger and I am glad I experienced it. Burgers are a highly subjective food.  I personally like mine with a little less greasy.  Not sure I would come back but glad I went
,,,,,"Came in on a random Wednesday expected to wait at least an hour but we're pleasantly surprised when they sat us at the bar immediately! It was so fun watching the chef's put together all of the meals- definitely don't pass up bar seating here! Our burgers and fries were delicious, as small Cheval frequenters we were shocked at how much better they were! Definitely don't miss the garlic aioli, it's the best part in my opinion!"
,,,,,We shared some Crispy Fries and I got the Double Cheeseburger.
,,,,,"It was all really good. One notable thing is that the Crispy Fries aren't actually crispy. They're good, but in no way ""crispy."""
,,,,,"Very cool place, not a ton of seating."
,,,,,I definitely want to come back and try the Bologna sandwich.
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"After the raving reviews, I had to check out Au Cheval! The burger seemed like the way to go based on all the Yelp reviews so I order that via ubereats. There was no indoor seating and takeout seemed like the easiest option. The ordering and pick up was straight forward. "
,,,,,"I got the burger and added their iconic bacon to it. Overall, I thought the burger was good however it certainly felt like I was paying ~$25 for a glorified burger. I wish it came with a side of fries or something to validate the cost. Though it was tasty, I don't think it's the best burger I've ever had when you break it down to taste to cost ratio."
,,,,,Amazing food and service was spectacular. Our waiter was super chill and helped us with the favorites ! Came out quick and worth the price no doubt.
,,,,,The plates are always cold for a fresh salad which is amazing and the burgers are always good. 
,,,,,Before Covid I went there for brunch food and it was amazing amazing amazing! I've been there after Covid for dinner multiple times and even in the situations were the guests were being unruly the staff was above top-notch!  I highly recommend it! And back in the day used to be a 3 to 4 hour wait but always give it a try because you might find that you can get in in 20 or 30 minutes if you're lucky!
,,,,,"Came here on a monday night around 5 pm and got seated after a 30 min wait for a group of 5. I got the single cheeseburger with egg and bacon which was so filling! And it came with two patties (the double burger comes with three). I really enjoyed the bacon on it, such a nice touch- it's not the usual crispy bacon that most places serve, but a thicker more juicy piece thats well seasoned. I also really liked the egg in the burger, it added a great flavor. The fries were also nice and crispy and enjoyed the sauce it came with. The chilaquiles were great as well and the chips tasted very fresh. Really enjoyed the meal and would definitely go back!"
,,,,,Holy. F**k. 
,,,,,What. An. INCREDIBLE. Burger. 
,,,,,"Difficult to describe how delicious this place was. Staff was friendly and food price was typical. Came here JUST for a burger and drink for lunch. It did not disappoint. Top 5 burger spots in my book. I could literally eat this burger every single day or my life. If you come to Chicago, do yourself a favor and come here and order the burger."
,,,,,Good. Fckn. Burger. 
,,,,,"The egg was cooked to perfection--the runny yolk perfectly incapsulates the juicy patty covered by a blanket of cheese. No raw lettuce, no raw tomato, because they get it. We don't need flavorless raw vegetables to dilute the flavor. "
,,,,,"The fries weren't served with ketchup, with good reason."
,,,,,"The garlic aioli is transformative--the gentle, airy notes of garlic has changed the way I understand condiments. All these years of ketchup dipping put to shame. And drenching the crispy fries in the egg yolk? You cannot go wrong with it. Just look at that egg! You've never seen a better lookin egg."
,,,,,"No gimmicks, just rly well-assembled food where each ingredient is purposefully put. The boiz and I left happy. "
,,,,,Still thinkin abt that egg.
,,,,,Meh. 
,,,,,Voted the best burger in town.
,,,,,Mehhh. 
,,,,,It was ok. 
,,,,,Nothing to write home about. The double cheeseburger has 3 patties. A bit too much meat going on with not enough fixings to balance all of that grease. The cheese they used was a interesting choice. It did remind me of the cheese you ate as a kid on a bologna sandwhich. 
,,,,,We ordered over the phone and did pick up. 
,,,,,Think it was $18 bucks or so with no sides just the burger itself. 
,,,,,That's a hard pass.
,,,,,"Yes the bacon is amazing, yes the burger meat is tasty. But also does the burger lack balance? Yes, there are no lettuce, onions or tomatoes and just pickles to add freshness back. Was my burger meat slightly dry? Yes, it was a little dry! I've given Au Cheval burgers the benefit of the doubt multiple times over the past few years. One time I also distinctly remember my burger being WAY too salty and can see that it's been an issue from other reviewers too, so consistency seems like it's an issue too. But not all is lost on the menu, I actually LOVE their crispy potato hash with duck heart gravy and their foie gras scrambled eggs and toast! These were the highlights for me oi.    last few times I've been which is ironic given that most people are coming for the burgers. "
,,,,,I have yet to find my version of what I would deem to be best burger in America and would love suggestions from any of y'all well eating people!
,,,,,Dinner for 4 including one appetizer a round of drinks & a round of shots was about $242 
,,,,,I would recommend this place thier staff was amazing especially our server i wjsh I got his name ..I highly recommend specifying how you would like your burger if you are not a fan of medium rare meat then ask for well down I was super disgusted by the redness in my burger but that wass my fought for not specifying 
,,,,,I am not typically a fan of pickle backs but their whiskey was really good and their pickle juice is home made .. I also ordered the the horses neck which is a fancy  Kentucky mule none the less the whiskey was also amazing 
,,,,,You have the option to add bacon or over easy egg to any burger. The bacon was extremely thick I opted for just a regular burger with no add on again specify well done if you don't like seeing the red in your meat 
,,,,,Per my friends this spot is usually crowded. Their inside space has very limited space so out side dinning actually works in their favor.   During covid  they are not accepting cash for final payment but tbey are accepting cash tips..
,,,,,I also just want to say their burger tasted like burger King and their fries tasted like McDonald's 
,,,,,They do not have hard copies of their menu but it looked to match their online menu.  Upon being seated you scan a QR code
,,,,,Honestly a disappointing experience from both a food and service perspective. 
,,,,,"It was a personal mistake to order the crispy fries while eating outside in humid high 80 degree weather, the egg and aioli congealed very quickly and ended up being very unappetizing. The burger was solid. "
,,,,,Our waitress was very condescending when my friend had questions about a drink and offered to get her a refill without informing her that she would be charged for a second beverage which we found dishonest or perhaps just lazy. 
,,,,,This was honestly a disappointing experience from a restaurant for which I had relatively high expectations. I rounded up to 3 from 2.5 stars as I know it has been difficult to keep quality front house staff during the pandemic but as the restaurant currently stands I will not be returning and would not recommend it to others.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,We ordered double cheeseburgers and fries for takeout from Au Cheval. It was definitely nice not to wait for several hours like I have in the past. The takeout was ready within ~30 minutes. 
,,,,,"Compared to in person, the meat was definitely a bit drier. They were just wrapped in foil, so they were a bit squished and messy when we got them, making the buns soggy as well. They packaged the egg separately so it stayed intact, which I appreciated! The fries were delicious as always, and they come with a great garlic aioli."
,,,,,"Overall, I was glad that takeout was an option and was satisfied with how quick it was. However, I felt the quality wasn't as good as it is for dine-in. I'd recommend stopping by once you can in person to get the full experience that lets their burgers shine!"
,,,,,"Au Cheval is a must have in the West Loop! The wait is definitely long, but you can put your name down and leave and explore the West Loop/other parts of Chicago! The single burger has two patties btw!! The plain fries come with a garlic aioli which is so good!!!!!! I would highly recommend getting the egg and bacon on the burger as well! Imo it's worth the extra money :)"
,,,,,"On my top-5 list for burgers. I went with the egg and bacon add and it was glorious. Long wait, but worth it. Service was solid. Lot's of local beers to go with your burger as well. Manager went out of his way to help me pay after the phone service incorrectly stated that they take ApplePay. They do not."
,,,,,We have NEVER had anything less than a stellar experience here.  Tonight was no exception!!!!
,,,,,"There was an ""incident"" at the table next to us.  The manager on duty took care of things in an extremely quiet and professional matter.  She took the time and care herself to make certain that the table was cleaned, sanitized, and ready for the next guests to sit at the table."
,,,,,"You hear stories about people going the extra mile to make sure everything is in order.  My wife and I can attest to the fact that she did indeed do that, and more!!!!"
,,,,,"We had heard kind of what happened grime the last two people that were at the table taking care of the bill.  They were kind of embarrassed with what happened.  We just said that things will happen, and just make sure that everyone is OK."
,,,,,"Like I said, everything was handled with great care and professionalism by everyone working there!!!"
,,,,,"Aside from that,  I will still say that they have the best fried bologna sandwich that I have EVER had!!!!  We ended up having the puff pastry desert.  This one is top notch!!!!"
,,,,,Kudos to everyone there!!!!  We will be back!!!!
,,,,,"We've only been there twice, as we've been reluctant to wait in line....."
,,,,,HOWEVER.... we're going to now....
,,,,,"Our first visit, last month, was great.  Staff was about as real and friendly as you can get.  We mentioned that we would be back to take our parents there when my wife's parents came to visit."
,,,,,"Dial the clock ahead to yesterday.... the staff totally remembered us and were just as welcoming to our entire family....   Food was delicious, as it was the first time we went. And they upped their game with the service this time out!!!  I honestly cannot remember a time where any staff was so kind, thoughtful, and genuine in their ability to enjoy us as much as we enjoyed them and ourselves, celebrating my in-laws 55th anniversary and my parents' 50th next month!!!!  My wife and I can only hope we took care of the staff as much as they took care of us!!!!"
,,,,,"We ARE coming back, much more often.  And we will bring more of our friends and family as well!!!  We'll also be telling everyone we know to come here, and if they have to wait... just wait..... it'll be worth it!!!"
,,,,,"My husband finally took me to get the legendary Su cheval burger, and it does live up to the hype. We each got a single cheeseburger with bacon, and we split a glass of the root beer they have on tap. That burger is good! 2 patties with cheese that is just melted enough to be gooey without being too messy, a couple of pickles and shallots for crunch, dijionnaise for some tang, and that THICK bacon. That bun is also pretty flawless, it holds together well, has a great char on it, and that brioche has a little sweetness which really complements the burger. The root beer was also a fun treat! I don't know if I can tell that it's better than any other root beer, but who really cares. Definitely make your way here if you're in chicago, it is worth it! Next time I think I'm going to try that fried bologna sandwich and that duck heart gravy with hashed browns, I heard those are amazing as well!"
,,,,,"Love their food. I've eaten at this location and in NYC multiple time. It's my favorite burger around. The way that I was spoken to tonight was surprising. Out of left field. So bad that the host made sure to let me know that I was on camera! For how bad he spoke to me. He told me to go fuck myself. I asked about the wait, there was no one behind me, he told me 1 and a half to 2 hours wait. There was no one else there, so I said ""really?,"" to which he replied, ""go fuck yourself."""
,,,,,"As good as the burger is, I will never go there again or any of their affiliate restaurants. "
,,,,,"Go fuck yourself, Au Cheval!"
,,,,,Cant go wrong with an Au Cheval burger or their bone marrow ! Parking can be tough but worth the circling.
,,,,,"Just went to Au Cheval for the second time ever last week and it was almost as good as I remembered it.  The first time I had it 2 years ago, I thought it was an absolute 11, best burger I've ever had!  Last week, after a Bulls game, a night out partying, and no food in my system for 24 hours, my first stop was Au Cheval at 11AM."
,,,,,"A party of 5 only took 15 minutes to be seated in a booth.  Had an old fashioned to start off which was your standard decent Thursday morning cocktail.  Useful tip: skip the fries and order  the Duck Hashbrowns, this is absolutely the best thing on the menu."
,,,,,"I ordered a single cheeseburger with bacon and egg.  Tip #2: Skip the egg, it drowns out the flavor of the bacon and the meat.  This burger is still amazing, but eating it a second time is like trying to watch the Sixth Sense again, when you already know Bruce Willis is dead, it doesn't give you that same OOOMPH during the initial viewing.  "
,,,,,Warning: Spoiler Alert Above
,,,,,"Non descript-looking gastropub in Chicago with very small space, limited seating and a 2-hour wait time.... why 5 stars? Have you tried their burger??? Its probably the best darn Burger in Chicago, heck, the Midwest! Cooked and seasoned to a perfect temperature, not too raw, not too done. Topped with cheese and caramelized bacon that, by in itself, is a glory on its own. This burger owns. The fries were fine I guess... but the BURGER! I dont care what else they serve, I dont care if the rest og their menu is meh (which Im sure is not!), but even if it was.... the burger is worth damn the 2 hour wait."
,,,,,One of the best burgers I've ever had!  A single is a double patty and a double is a triple patty. A good sized burger and perfectly
,,,,,"constructed with minimal dripping.  Get the bacon! First come first serve, reservations not accepted. The restaurant is small so expect a wait but I promise it is well worth it. Very straight to the point - limited menu selections but they do it all very well.  The restaurant is located in an adorable area with tons of restaurants and bars around and bistro lighting on the streets. Loved the vibe of this restaurant and neighborhood!"
,,,,,"visited this a few weeks prior because it was on everyones must visit spots. the burger itself was ok, but the bacon was phenomenal! they seated me at the bar, so i had a front row seat to the kitchen prep but it was really tight. not much seating overall. the service was pretty good, all the workers made sure i was ok w the menu & food. overall, the place was ok but slightly overrated"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"We came right when it open. There want much of a wait time luckily for us. We got the cheeseburger. Honestly, I don't like burgers in general, but I wanted to give this place a try. I think the burger is okay, but I'm still not a fan of burger. What I do like on this sandwhich is that you can add egg and bacon. The burger was very rich and flavorful. I like their bacon. Also, their hash was amazing. This whole meal is very heavy but was pretty good. I definitely couldn't finish my burger navies it's so large. I think if you're into burger, this is definitely a place worth trying."
,,,,,I dream about this burger. Seriously so good. A must when you come to Chicago. Need to add the bacon to it. The fries were also delicious and came with an aioli that complimented everything perfectly. The wait can be long so be sure to come early or plan on going somewhere else for drinks before while you wait!
,,,,,"When arriving to Chicago, one of the first things I heard was to try au chevals burgers. It's the best burger in town. Tbh it was a damn good burger! It was grilled nicely, and the egg complimented the burger so well.  The fries come with an aioli sauce which paired perfectly."
,,,,,I love Au Cheval! The aioli with the fries are *chefs kiss* - only bad thing is the wait. 
,,,,,Pro tip: If you want Au Cheval without the wait go to Small Cheval. Although it is not the same - its pretty darn close !! Kills the craving. Either way - Au Cheval has become (in my humble opinion) a Chicago staple.
,,,,,"When in Chicago this place is a MUST! I cannot emphasize how amazing and juicy this cheese burger was, and not to mention the savory thick bacon. The the French's fries were golden, crispy and nice and crunchy! Make a reservation, we didn't have one but we're able to be seated a the counter which was fine. The service was fast and great! I will definitely visit again when I'm Chicago!!"
,,,,,"Mmm Au Cheval, you are officially the best restaurant I've tried in Chicago."
,,,,,I halved a double cheeseburger with bacon and egg with a friend and barely finished it. We also ordered two fries on the side for my table of five. We might've been good with just one.
,,,,,Double Cheeseburger with bacon and egg - 9/10
,,,,,- portion size... THREE PATTIES
,,,,,- the meat was very juicy and the egg made it a bit juicier
,,,,,"- the bacon was not as crazy as I expected it to be. It wasn't fatty and soft, but more tough and dry. "
,,,,,- The burger came with a pickle which canceled out the oily in the burger.
,,,,,Fries with garlic aioli - 10/10 
,,,,,- so CRISPY
,,,,,"- garlic aioli is addicting, proceed with caution"
,,,,,- a lot of food if you also get a double Cheeseburger 
,,,,,Our server was so kind and checked up on us and answered any questions we had with a smile :)
,,,,,The environment was very welcoming and we waited about 45 min for a table of 5 on a Monday for late lunch.
,,,,,"Best burger I have ever eaten. There is no second place. Less is more is exemplified in this burger as it screams quality. ""What have I been eating?"" I wonder.  A stunning example of what a food (and brilliant prep) can do."
,,,,,Two hour wait and I can see why.
,,,,,This is my favorite burger joint in Chicago. I make it a point to stop here every time I'm in town and it's consistently good. 
,,,,,"SINGLE BURGER (10/10) - yeah so this is really two patties, so just beware. It's SO good. I've had it with the bacon, but I usually don't get it because the burger is so much food already. But if you are a bacon lover, then I highly recommend adding it! "
,,,,,"Their sides are good too, but I really only come to get my cheeseburger fix! Oh and their ranch is homemade - soooo good!"
,,,,,This review is not about the food or cocktails. 
,,,,,I've been coming here; introduced friends here; know and love that Au Cheval is a thriving restaurant in my city of Chicago's Fulton Market. I've always highly recommended it. 
,,,,,But today I was severely disappointed. 
,,,,,Came with a friend to surprise his sister's girlfriend for BIRTHDAY cocktails. 
,,,,,"The server confronts us, tells us we 'technically' cut the line. They were in a booth. The bar was empty. He told us he would allow us to sit with them 'THIS' time. His tone and tact was off, and if it was that big of an issue, the hostess should have addressed us, NOT our server."
,,,,,"IS my $green$ good enough? We spent over $200 at a casual b-day lunch. Mind you, my friend & I didn't want to order more food or cocktails; because we at that moment were placed in an uncomfortable situation. Appetite spoiled. No b-day recognition."
,,,,,EXPERIENCE RUINED.
,,,,,"This location is walk-in only. We walked in on a Wednesday around noon and had no problem being seated. Drinks were fantastic! My burger? Even better. The wings were unexpectedly very Asian inspired, but tasted great (even reheated). My date also enjoyed the chilaquiles. It was a ton of food!"

,,,,,"Literally the best service I have ever had! Our waitress Jenna went above and beyond to take care of us! Would recommend this place solely based off of Jenna! The food was also delicious! But man Jenna, kudos to you!!!!"
,,,,,Thank you!
,,,,,"I've heard such amazing things about this place and was extremely excited to try their famous burger. I ordered the double cheeseburger and crispy fries. The burger was way too salty and I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the burger since I tasted salt every bite so that was very disappointing. The fries was very good with the Mornay sauce, garlic aioli, and egg. "
,,,,,"No reservations - you have to put your name down and when it gets busy, you can't order to go."
,,,,,We probably ordered too much for the two of us. However our time in Chicago is short. We tried to visit earlier in the week on Monday and it was packed at 12:30 with a 45 min wait. We had to resort to Plan B for that day. 
,,,,,"Today, we got to the restaurant at 10:55am. We were able to get seated; but the place quickly filled up. When we were done at 12:30, there was a short line outside. The place is small and narrow and can probably accommodate 40-50 people at any given time. There is no reservation option. "
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,Roasted bone marrow
,,,,,Double cheeseburger with an egg
,,,,,Chopped salad
,,,,,French fries
,,,,,The bone marrow was sooo good. Probably too early in the day to eat bone marrow. Oh well!  
,,,,,Chopped salad to help us feel better about eating so much meat early in the day. 
,,,,,We should've ordered the regular cheeseburger as I think it comes with two Pattie's. The double came with three. We did not finish the cheeseburger. I wish we could. Just no room in the belly. 
,,,,,I could only manage a handful of fries. I wish I had more room
,,,,,In the belly. 
,,,,,We also ordered a Bloody Mary. This is one of the best Bloody Marys I have tasted. Their French press coffee was also excellent!
,,,,,"This place gets five stars for the food, the service and the clean restroom"
,,,,,Did I wait 2 hours on a Sunday for dinner? Yes. Was it worth it? 10000% yes. Here are some hot tips.
,,,,,"1) come during off hours because it's first come, first serve. This means before 5:30 for dinner if you don't want to wait a while."
,,,,,2) get your name on a waitlist and go grab a cocktail. Bad hunter was our go-to spot (RIP :( ) but we went to Bar Siena and it did not disappoint. Tipsy burgers are the best burgers.
,,,,,3) Au Cheval has VERY reasonable alcohol prices for the area so take advantage of that if you aren't boozed up from the pregame cocktails.
,,,,,"4) If you eat bacon, ALWAYS worth it to get it (+egg) on your burger"
,,,,,Bam. There's a reason this place is worth it. A legend among legends.
,,,,,"We decided to visit Au Cheval during our stay in Chicago, and it did not disappoint. Upon arrival, we were offered a choice between outdoor and indoor seating. Masks are also required for indoor seating. We chose to sit indoors, and we were immediately seated. We started with the general Janes honey  fried chicken, and the fries with the egg added. The chicken came out first, and it was DELICIOUS. We were able to share the chicken, as it was a very sizable portion. The fries came out a few minutes later, but after eating for a bit, we noticed that we weren't given the fries that were ordered. We spoke with our server and he brought out the correct fries, and without our request, the fries were complimentary. The service was spectacular and fast. The restaurant was clean and relaxing. Our stomachs were filled after we ate the chicken and fries. "
,,,,,"The chicken was so good, I'd contemplated grabbing an order on our way back home (to Indiana). "
,,,,,I can't wait to return to this restaurant. The service and food is so so good!
,,,,,Arrived at 3:45pm on a Thursday. There were people but there was still seating at the tables available and at the bar counter. 
,,,,,So need to arrive at off time to avoid a wait
,,,,,"Double cheeseburger ($14.95) - 3 patties, cheese, djion mustard. Burger is cooked with a hint of red which keeps it soft which I like. "
,,,,,Add egg ($1.00). Beautiful laid egg.
,,,,,"Add bacon ($3.95)- nice super thick pork belly bacon. Like someone mentioned looks like Candied Korean bacon, but taste is super soft, fatty,savory, and not sweet. I'm ate the bacon by it self cause it's that good and gets lost in the burger. "
,,,,,Fries ($6.95)- comes with side of aioli. Cooked in duck fat. Really cripsy and hearty fries. Tasty. 
,,,,,Service is superb. I think the burger is good but mind blowing that

,,,,,"Recommend coming early for dinner or at ""off-times"" to get into this famous Chicago burger restaurant. No reservations available, but definitely worth the wait for this food! Perfectly crispy fries and juicy cheeseburgers. MUST get the egg on top!"
,,,,,"Believe the hype! The burger at Au Cheval amazing! I live in downtown Chicago and this is the only place I'll get a burger from. It's the perfect classic burger with cheese, bacon, pickles and whatever other toppings you want. The patties are thin, which keeps them juicy and allows for an even cook. The bacon is thick! They use a special sauce that's really all you need-no ketchup, mustard or mayo. Honestly, no review can do it justice-JUST TRY IT! "
,,,,,"Their cocktails are also good, the fries with the garlic aioli are worth it, and the wings are a must!"
,,,,,I mean it's good but small cheval is even better and cheaper and quicker. We thought au cheval was a fancy sit down but it's a very casual vibe. IMO overhyped. Just go to small cheval!
,,,,,I really liked this area it was where all the good eateries is nearby. 
,,,,,.
,,,,,So I came in and got sat down at the bar quickly because table for one rocks. But the  party for 2 behind me was a 1 hr wait. 
,,,,,.
,,,,,After I sat down I was ready to order. I got the foie gras scrambled egg. Yes I ordered it wrong. When the food came I was like oops I didn't want this and I did say it wrong. They were very nice and let me have it too. The dish I wanted was double cheese burger with bacon and foi gras and sunny side egg. 
,,,,,.
,,,,,"The foi gras burger was super amazing. It was made with love. The presentation was amazing. The first bite had me rolling back my eyes. It was a 30 dollar burger without fries, but it was super amazing. Order this if you come here. Burger is a must but mine as well get the foi gras burger with everything on it. I thought it was better than Gordon ramsey 30 dollar burger instead. "
,,,,,.
,,,,,"Overall service was on point. They checked up on us and making sure everything is what a customer wants no matter whose fault it is. I really loved how they treated me. If I'm ever in chicago I'm coming back to this spot for sure. If there is a wait for this spot go to the nearby coffee shop called swada coffee to kill some time and have yourself a military latte, its amazing! Thanks for reading and have a yelptastic day!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This places feels like an upscale diner with legit hip hop and good music playing in the background. Burgers are massive and fries are on point. The ambiance is cool, but after all the hype and waiting to get in here, expectations fell kind of short. Good was good, ambiance was cool, but for an American burger joint.. ehhh. The door guy/manager was very snobby about the 2 hour wait (relax big guy, you work at a restaurant). "
,,,,,"Get a Rez, try it, cross it off your list."
,,,,,This one gets the elusive 5 stars. 
,,,,,"I was in town for a couple of days with the family and have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. This place is known to have very long wait times, so we went on a Wed at 11:00 (right when they opened) and were seated right away. It was good timing as it was packed 45 minutes late. "
,,,,,"It has a cool lounge/bar vibe and is fairly small. I had my two children with me and felt comfortable. Not the kind of place you'd probably want to take the kids to on a Sat evening, but, for lunch, seemed fine to me. "
,,,,,"All 4 of us ordered the cheeseburger and added bacon l and an egg. We also ordered some fries for the table. This burger is often said to be one of the best in the country, and it definitely lived up to the hype. The bacon was unbelievable and the burger was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Kinda like an elevated simple diner burger. The fries were perfect. Crispy, salty and served with some type of aioli that was really good. The bar was great as well. "
,,,,,"Across the board, everyone enjoyed their meal. Even my 8 year old was loving the burger. Definitely worth the visit."
,,,,,"Someone needs to roll me out of here because I can't move from being so full. This place is 1000% worth the hype. From the matzo ball soho, kale Cesar, fried chicken, burgers and fries, nothing was less than amazing. "
,,,,,The service is great on top of the Insane food. We couldn't get enough. I wish I lived here so we could come back all the time. Worth the wait (although our wait wasn't more than 30 mins).
,,,,,"Their burger gives me the meat sweats, so I eat half and it's delicious."
,,,,,"I'm in the no-bacon camp. I tried to get into it, but the flavor profile of sweet pork belly just doesn't go with the all-American beef burger."
,,,,,Get yourself a good friend in the neighborhood who is willing to put their name down for you.
,,,,,"I must say, I was not expecting the burger to live up to its hype. But it was pretty damm good, It's a burger that keeps you wanting to go back for another bite. We ordered a double thinking it was a double patty but it was actually three patties. I guess the single patty is two patties. We ordered it with the bacon. Overall the burger was meaty and thickkk. Delicious. And fries were thick too. The aioli was not my fav. Alarmist was on the tab too. Best hazy in town. Super goood. "
,,,,,"However, we lucked out on the wait. We went during COVID times. Was told it was a 30 min wait but it turned out to be just a few. I think that definitely had an impact on our dining experience. My bf told me normally it's like a 5 hrs wait. Crazy. But the restaurant itself is so small! So that makes sense. "
,,,,,Au Cheval lives up to its expectations. Would recommend.
,,,,,Came here with my wife for lunch on a weekday and we surprisingly didn't have to wait! The inside has a nice vibe and the workers are friendly too.
,,,,,"I got the double cheeseburger with bacon and the egg added and it was probably the best burger I've ever had! The patties themselves were a little on the dry side for my liking but the runny yolk of the egg helped with that. Easily the best part of the burger was the thick cut bacon!! Crispy on the outside but not tough, and also had a great sweet glaze on it that balanced out the burger nicely."
,,,,,Overall I'd recommend coming here once if you're a burger person and I'm very glad I tried it after seeing all the hype! But personally I don't think I'd come here again considering the steep price.
,,,,,"This place is must try if you're visiting the area!! Parking was very difficult to find, so we ended up parking farther away and walking over. Our wait time was about 40 minutes for 2 tables on a Wednesday night. They offered indoor and outdoor seating. (We heard the longest wait time was about 8hrs because the space inside is really small.) The person taking down our names for the waitlist was really nice and friendly. When you go inside, the place is pretty dim with a small light on top and candles around you. "
,,,,,"We enjoyed a lot of the foods we tried. I was definitely recommend a side of bacon. It was slightly different from the one in the burger with a hint of sweetness. I couldn't stop thinking about that bacon the next day!! We tried the burger, which was great. The chicken was a little on the sweeter side, but had great texture and flavor complexity. Bone marrow was just okay for me though. Fries came with garlic aoli, so that tasted great. Overall, we had a great experience here and would definitely come back!"
,,,,,"Best Place I've been to in a Long time! Food was excellent! There was a line out the door but the wait wasn't that bad. I'm not a spoiled brat who can't wait it out. Service was quick and fast , the music was great."
,,,,,"When planning our trip to Chicago, I asked some friends which restaurants are Chicago's MUST-TRYS... and they all said Au Cheval. "
,,,,,"We got to the restaurant around 9 PM and the waitlist was about an hour. Luckily, they had a few seats at the bar that were open a little earlier so we just sat at the bar, which turned out to be pretty nice! "
,,,,,"Au Cheval did not disappoint! The Hemingway Daquiri was strong and delicious, and the Old Fashioned was pretty good too. "
,,,,,"The single cheeseburger, which is really a double, was absolutely delicious! Make sure you add the bacon and fried egg - totally worth it! The sweetness of the bacon really balances everything since the meat patties are so heavy. The drink options here were pretty good too. When we were ready for another drink, the bartender let us sample a few before deciding on a local Chicago beer... which I guess is a perk of sitting at the bar. He also recommended the chocolate dessert shot, and it was pretty good! "
,,,,,Another perk of sitting at the bar... you meet random people and they give you great recommendations on other local restaurants to try!
,,,,,"A five star burger? Yes my friends, truly a burger worthy of five stars. The single (which is two patties - 1/2lb) plus egg and bacon, might be the best burger I have ever eaten.  I understand why on some night there is a 3-4 hour wait. Fries also crispy, and good flavor. Old Fashion, perfection. Not sure where they can improve. This one is worth the stop and the wait."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,I heard many good things about this place but it felt more like hype then actually being good.
,,,,,I ordered a burger with the bacon and my husband got the one with both bacon and egg. My husband thought it was the best burger he's ever had but to me it tasted like a typical burger. Mine was also very dry and the only thing good about it was the bacon. I had my husband try a bit of my burger and his wasn't as dry as mine so I guess they overcooked mine. Either way I give the bacon like 5 stars but the burger it self wasn't worth the price. It was good but not like the best burger like most people say it to be.
,,,,,"This place is like a Chicago landmark or something... soo just know if you go on a weekend you will be waiting 1-3 hrs to be seated. There is a lot of cool places around so the wait will go by, however I recommend you check in every so often I've heard this speeds up the process."
,,,,,"Alright the food... I had the double cheese burger with bacon and egg... being that I am from Dallas this may be the reason the burger did not take my breath away. All around the burger was great, I mean it is definitely up there but I don't think I'll catch myself waiting more than 15 min for an Au Cheval burger again. Nothing against the place it's just the hype wasn't there for me. I think the place is well established so I recommend going just on a it's a ""classic"" vibe. But hey unless u like live burgers iono if this really gon have u like woah. also got the fries they were cool."
,,,,,"Fuck it ima just be real ... wait if u want but don't be mad when I told u it wasn't worth more than 15 minutes, I'm telling u now! "
,,,,,Chicago foodies don't come for me lol
,,,,,"I distinctly remember stumbling into an Au Cheval in New York years ago, and I had been having dreams about that burger since. Finally, I'm in Chicago and it was my mission to dine here again. I ended up greatly hyping this place up to my friend - and thankfully, it lived up to expectations. "
,,,,,"If you're thinking about ordering the Crispy Fries with eggs, this is your sign to do so. I can confidently say that you will not regret it. I got a single cheeseburger - which to my surprise, has two patties. The double cheeseburger actually had three. Yes - I added an egg and you should too. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious so I munched away until I was full to the brim. Seriously, I could barely move."
,,,,,Defiantly get the bone marrow!! It was absolutely amazing!!!
,,,,,I love everything we ordered here!!
,,,,,The cheese burger is also one of the best cheese burger I've had in the US!
,,,,,The portion is so big we couldn't finish the fries!
,,,,,The restaurant does not take reservation so try to go in early to avoid the li g wait!
,,,,,I wanted for almost 1.5 hour but it was worth it!
,,,,,"This place is no bueno. Not sure if it was an off day, or if it was our waitress who made it a bad experience, but it was a letdown! "
,,,,,"Almost all of us we're missing a part of our meal, and when we told our waitress ""hey I'm missing my toast"" she was like ""oh! Be right back"". Then 20 minutes later showed up giggling that she forgot our toast. Offered us a free cinnamon roll to go to make up for it. Never got that. "
,,,,,The food wasn't great. Service was horrible.
,,,,,Great food! Cheeseburger is very good. The thick cuts on bacons that you can put on your burger is 10/10. Fries with their home made garlic sauce is very good. Love the atmosphere of their restaurant.
,,,,,3.5 STARS OVERALL (I just prefer to round up rather than down). 
,,,,,"Is it an experience? Most certainly. To live in the downtown area of Chicago and not go to Au Cheval is something nearly unheard of. So naturally, as a recent west coast to Midwest transplant, I had to scope out the burger game of the infamous Au Cheval. "
,,,,,"My SO and I arrived around 4 pm on a Friday to put our names down and were told it would be 1.5 hours. Not as horrible as I had heard that it can get sometimes--people have waited 3 hours during busier hours. We did some work at a nearby cafe and returned with about 20 min to spare of our described time. Unfortunately, we did end up having to wait an additional 15 min, but in the grand scheme of things, 15 min isn't hugely significant. I say this more as a warning to others--if you don't want to be patient this is not the restaurant for you. "
,,,,,We're brought back into the restaurant. The overall atmosphere is an interesting mixture of diner and sophisticated/dark ambience. The chefs are visible. 
,,,,,"I will say, I think they have a phenomenal beer menu. My partner and I have preference to IPAs, lagers or pilsners with citrus forward tones. Au Cheval had a few options on draft. "
,,,,,"The food: I got the single (don't be fooled, comes with 2 patties). I really enjoyed mine! It was flavorful and each bite was pleasantly cheesy and meaty at the same time. Fan of the bun as well. My partner got the single but with bacon AND egg. He enjoyed it but wished the bacon wasn't sweet. I'd have to agree. I prefer my bacon savory and not ""candied."" So if you're hesitant to order the bacon, be aware of that flavor profile. We also ordered the fries with egg and sauces. I am a huge French fry lover but these were just far far too salty. They're honestly one of the bigger reasons this review is only a 3.5 stars. They come with a bechamel style sauce (not much flavor, also quite salty) and an aioli (decent but nothing to write home about). "
,,,,,"I will say, the service was great. Our server checked in a couple times, and had witty things to say every so often. "
,,,,,"But, sadly, the fries were truly not great. And, yeah, it's a good burger no doubt, but I really can't see myself waiting over an hour and a half again for it."
,,,,,Does not take reservations but waits during the weekdays are short.
,,,,,I recommend coming at around lunch time before noon!
,,,,,Do yourself a favor and split one burger and fries between two people; that way you can sample other food in the area afterwards. 
,,,,,The food here is heavy and I needed a nap after dining here.
,,,,,"We were in from San Francisco (another tourist town) and always try to avoid the tourist establishments and attractions and go with the locals. Au Cheval was a mix of both and I'm a burger consumer and critic.  The burgers here are OUTSTANDING.  At first when I heard the burgers were thin and not to be ordered mid-rare or rare, I committed to mind while waiting that they will be tough and dry.  NOT!!!  They were perfectly juicy and not over done. "
,,,,,The staff is way  cool - especially Jordan who mans the front desk and has spent time out in California. 
,,,,,"A MUST is to try the side of bacon.  I first thought ""what a side of bacon"".  It's like a savory pork belly cross of bacon and has ultra flavor.  First stop on my next trip into Chi-town!"
,,,,,"One of the best burgers, if not the best, in the city and not much really needs to be said. No crazy bells and whistles, just a good classic burger. Bone marrow appetizer was great too. Wish I could go more often but getting a table is tough."
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"AU BABY! Au Cheval did not fail to deliver. We came here during lunch and anticipated an hour wait at least. To our surprise, we were seated right away. "
,,,,,"We got a seat at the bar with a nice view of the kitchen. Man, that kitchen is packed and busy but that's where the magic happens. I ordered the single cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg. It's actually two patties and pretty big so I wouldn't order a double unless you really wanted it. My friend told me to get the garlic aioli on the side and slap it on that b. I did just that and.. that's IT. It was everything. The burger is unctuous. I don't know how else to describe it, but it was heaven on earth. Cocktails made a nice pairing as well."
,,,,,"IF I COULD GIVE them 6 stars - I WOULD. My standards for food and service are HIGH. There is a reason they can drop clout and claim they are the #1 burger joint in America. Visiting from California, it was recommended to try Au Cheval. Yes, it's true - do not come during peak hours, you'll wait (although it is worth it). So - we went on a Monday afternoon before the commute hour began; approx. 330 PM. Immediate seating available at the bar or a 10-15 min wait for a table. "
,,,,,"We get seated, every single patron/employee was attentive, friendly, and just as excited about the food as we were. "
,,,,,"Now, the food: server comes over and asks, would you like a salad on the house? Sure, but Why, I ask? Ah, we had extra and figured I'd over it to you...we'll take it!"
,,,,,"Delicious! The burger was perfect. You could tell the chef put a lot of thought into it - from the selection, softness, and freshness of the bread, perfectly seasoned and tender meat, delicious pickles/onions. NO EXTRAS needed to be added to this burger. The fries - cooked to perfection, and that garlic aioli...ketchup who???? "
,,,,,"Next time I'm in Chicago (there will be a next time), I'll be trying the drinks/beer. "
,,,,,"Y'all...this IS one of theee best, if not the best burgers I've EVER had. Go!!!!"
,,,,,Pros: 
,,,,,You'll never be able to compare to another burger place. 
,,,,,Cons: 
,,,,,You'll never be able to compare to another burger place. 
,,,,,"Simply, amazing."
,,,,,The burgers here are delicious but were they worth the 2 hour wait? No. 
,,,,,"Upon arrival, we had to put our name/number down for the waitlist. The wait was supposed to be 2 hours. They only extend 10 minutes for you to get back once your turn is up. This is definitely not enough time for such a long wait -- especially if it's a cold night and you're at the closest coffee shop 15 minutes away. "
,,,,,The meat is good and the portion sizes for the burgers are huge (a single burger is equivalent to a double at other places). Service was friendly and the ambience is dark and cozy. 
,,,,,"Not worth 2 hours of a wait, but I don't regret visiting to check out the hyped"
,,,,,I'm so glad we came to Au Cheval today! The service was impeccable and the food was incredible. We started with the bone marrow which was so rich and fatty and came with toast that was so crispy and buttery. The chicken liver was also light and delicious. Our hash was much heavier but the potatoes were super crispy.
,,,,,"From a service perspective, we were super happy. One marrow was much smaller than the others and they replaced it for us on the house. We also received some fries on the house which were a nice surprise!! "
,,,,,"Overall the food was absolutely delicious. Be warned that it is a bit heavier, but we had a wonderful time!"
,,,,,"First meal in Chicago was FLAWLESS. We came around 4:45 for an early dinner on a Thursday and the hostess said there would be a wait if we wanted indoor but she could seat us immediately if outdoor, so we ate outdoors. My husband and I both got the single cheeseburger (which is really two patties already so no need for a double unless you really want it) and split the fries. It was so yummy! What we both liked was that the burger held together well - nothing dripping out and the bun was thick enough to catch everything. I think the sauce on the burger was like a Mayo with grated/chopped red onions. "
,,,,,"The hostess and our server were both really excited when we told them that it was our first meal after landing and gave us suggestions on the menu, also told us about some good touristy spots to check out. Loved the meal overall!!"
,,,,,"Of all the iconic Chicago restaurants, I think Au Cheval actually lives up to its hype if you order what they recommend, which is the burger with the egg and millionaire's bacon added. Everything together makes for a rich, flavorful burger - so if you don't eat pork, I wouldn't recommend coming here. It is a bit pricey for a burger, and without their special bacon, it really is just a burger. However, if you have no dietary restrictions, it might be worth your while! Solid fries and beer selection too. "
,,,,,(Note: the single cheeseburger actually comes with 2 patties!)
,,,,,Come here right when they open (if you can) to avoid a long wait and enjoy the best burger you'll ever have. Definitely add an egg and bacon if that floats your boat. 
,,,,,"The patties are cooked perfectly, the outside is crispy while the inside is juicy and tender. The bacon adds a sweet taste while giving the burger extra texture and the runny egg is a great touch. "
,,,,,Note that the food coma after eating this burger is real af.
,,,,,"We've all heard it's the best burger in this big town, the wait is long, and it's expensive. Is it the best though? Eh, who cares, you're only going to come here a couple of times a year. I've only had two burgers in my life that didn't require ketchup: a Wagyu burger at the airport in Tokyo and this one. So that about says it."
,,,,,"I prefer my burger well dead, and this one was still moo'n a bit, but a lil pink ain't never hurt nobody. That was the thickest bacon I've ever had in my life though. Never can have too much of a good thing. The fries were serviceable. Nothing special. "
,,,,,"The ketchup was runny and disappointing though. You'd think a dimly lit gourmet burger spot with loud music (too dang loud, but they were playing some dope instrumental hip hop and classics!) would make their own special ketchup. The butter pickles are great. Get em. Staff is extra courteous, probably because they are sensible humans who acknowledge you waited two hours to pay $25 for a burger and fries lol. So, overall it's a win."
,,,,,"Great atmosphere and wonderful service. The single burger with bacon was tasty and filling. Best burger ever, not quite but I would recommend this spot because my experience was fantastic and the food is enjoyable."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"I very rarely eat beef and had not had a hamburger in about 10 years, but enough people told me that Au Cheval was *worth it* that I decided to go for it! We came on a Saturday at around 2PM and lucked out with being seated right away. "
,,,,,"I ordered the single cheeseburger with bacon and an egg. The burger was great, but that bacon though..... WOW. If you don't order the bacon, you're missing out. I'd come back here just for a plate of their bacon, which is almost more like pork belly. The portion was massive and I struggled to finish my burger, even after ""donating"" my second patty to somebody else in my party."
,,,,,"Do not sleep on the french fries with garlic aioli. They were some of the best I have had, and at the end of the meal, I wished I had more room left to eat more fries!"
,,,,,"We lucked out and managed to snag a table at Au Cheval on Friday evening, and absolutely loved the meal! "
,,,,,"We started with the chopped chicken liver, which was a dish I've never had before. While I was expecting more of a pâté style dish, I was pleasantly surprised with the smoothness of the liver in its chopped form! The liver is mixed with dill and onions, and the flavors blended together very nicely. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the size of the dish was much bigger than we had anticipated, especially given the price - it was a great deal, and no surprise that it's a fan favorite!"
,,,,,"The general Jane's honey-fried chicken was also very tasty, and spicier than I was expecting (though I do have a low spice tolerance). This was another dish that was much bigger than expected. I thought the chicken was very tasty, but would prioritize the chicken liver and burger over the chicken wings. "
,,,,,"The fries were super tasty, and as a huge fry fan, I was very pleased fat the texture and quality of the fries. The French fries stayed crisp and crunchy even with the gravy on top, and the inside of the fries had a great potato texture without being too dense or airy. Personally I would stick with regular fries over the full dish with gravy and an egg since I felt the extras on top didn't necessarily add too much to the dish, but really loved the fries with the garlic aioli. "
,,,,,"The burger was the highlight of the meal, and much tastier than I had expected given the ""classic"" nature of the burger. The patties were cooked very nicely and were moist and tender, and the bacon was phenomenal. The flavors of the burger were so classic and yet very original to Au Cheval, and I would definitely come back just to get this burger. "
,,,,,"Overall we really enjoyed this meal, and would recommend it to anyone in the area! Just be prepared for long waits as they are extremely popular and don't take reservations."
,,,,,I now understand why Au Cheval has SO many great reviews!! My friend and I visited on a Friday at 12:30 pm and was seated right away inside. My friend ordered a salad and I got the cheeseburger with bacon. We ordered one side of fries to share too. 
,,,,,"The burger was massive - which honestly isn't a bad thing!! There are two large pieces of bacon wedged in the middle and it was a highlight of my meal. They were slightly sweetened and crispy, which added great texture to the burger. There was a sauce on the bun and some pickles. "
,,,,,"My friend's salad had some sort of special ranch like dressing that paired well with the bacon. Similar to the burger, the salad was massive. We ended up not finishing either the burger or salad because it was so big. "
,,,,,"While we were eating our entree, the staff dropped off a Mille fueille dessert for us on the house since they said there was an extra made in the kitchen! What a treat! "
,,,,,The pasty was so flaky and paired so great with the cream inside. It's definitely a dessert you should share and get to finish off your meal. 
,,,,,"Overall, I'd highly recommend everyone try Au Chaval!!"
,,,,,"My friends and I stopped by and I guess we picked a great time, because we only had to wait 30 min for our table outside. We were told that once they're ready for us, we would only have 10 minutes to come back. This really impressed me, because I had a friend told me he once waited 3 hours to eat here. "
,,,,,"We were seated in a booth outside (which made me really happy), and were handed QR codes to access the menu. I imagine for people who aren't as technologically savvy, they would still offer a physical menu."
,,,,,"We ordered crispy fries to share, and for myself, I ordered a single burger with an egg. The crispy fries were so good!!! I didn't know what mornay sauce was, but after I tried it (and then googled it), it checks out. The mornay sauce was good and so was the aioli. I kept alternating between the two dips. "
,,,,,"I was surprised that the single burger came with two patties! It was a very pleasant surprise. The burger was big, and the bun was so soft. The patty is cooked to medium, so altogether, it was very chewy and flavorful. Sadly, I'm not a big onion or pickle fan, so when I saw the burger came with onions (in the sauce) and pickles, I scraped them off. However, I ended up adding the onion sauce back in because it was good LOL"
,,,,,"I also don't really like root beer, but I felt compelled to buy a root beer float. I was glad I did, because the taste and presentation of it was amazing!"
,,,,,"Was in town for just a weekend and I'm glad I cane to Au Cheval. As most people warn about, they have very long wait times. My friend put his name down with the host before picking me up from the airport to kill some time because the wait was around 2 hours. I recommend giving your name and going to one of the bars in the neighborhood as there are many and it's a cool area. "
,,,,,"Anyhow, I obviously recommend their burger with they outstanding thick cut beacon. "
,,,,,We tried foie gras with eggs and it was fireee. Also came with toast so that was a plus
,,,,,Their fried chicken is a must! So crispy and flavorful just wowed me.
,,,,,A place somehow known to all Chicago natives and tourists. When friends come to visit I always mention this place for a gourmet burger. There are no reservations so if you like being timely I'd suggest coming for lunch during the weekdays if you can to avoid the wait.
,,,,,Food (8.5/10):
,,,,,"The single cheeseburger with egg - which has two patties. Comes with cuts of thick pork belly bacon, pickles, grilled/toasted buns. Embodies what you're looking for in a burger that will send you straight into food coma limbo."
,,,,,Garlic fries - a great addition to your burger for dine in is my recommendation to send you further along into food coma territory.
,,,,,Value (7/10):
,,,,,If I recall correctly this place is a Michelin guide spot. Considering the gourmet quality and branding I'd say pricing is okay - about $12 a burger in final cost.
,,,,,The best burger I have and will ever eat! The thick cut bacon on an amazing patty. I don't like egg yolk so I order without it but it still hits the spot! Highly recommend!
,,,,,Omg.
,,,,,The single cheeseburger with bacon was MINDBLOWING.
,,,,,"It was so simple, two patties, cheese, bacon, aioli (?), pickles, on top of grilled brioche buns. I never knew that's all a burger needs. People said that the egg was necessary but honestly, the bacon was all the burger needed to be complete. The patties were of such good quality, they were so juicy, and the bacon was these amazing thick cut caramelized pork belly that was SO easy to bite through. I was a bit hesitant at first thinking that I was going to accidentally pull away the entire slice of bacon at the first bite, but it never happened. In fact, my burger didn't fall apart at all which was another testament to just how perfect this burger was. We also got a side of fries and it was delicious with the garlic aioli. "
,,,,,"Just an important tip that people before have mentioned: the single cheeseburger has TWO patties while the double cheeseburger has THREE patties. The single was more than plenty, especially if you add the bacon and side of fries."
,,,,,"Our friends also got the honey glazed chicken wings (appetizer), which they also enjoyed a LOT. We didn't try them but we're definitely going to get it and the bone marrow the next time we go again. "
,,,,,"On top of the burger, the BLUEBERRY MUFFIN was SO worth it. It was listed under appetizers but honestly, it made the perfect dessert with butter, strawberry preserves, and hot fudge. The blueberry muffin was cut in half and seared. The outsides were perfectly crunchy while the inside was moist, soft, fluffy, and plain delicious."
,,,,,I can't wait to go back--it was worth the 45 min wait on a hot Sunday!
,,,,,"Saw the amazing reviews on this place and couldn't get reservations for Girl & the Goat across the street. So we decided to save some money and try this place out. We sat outside on a 4:30 pm on Wednesday. Easily got a table. Inside is pretty small, So i hear the space runs out pretty quickly. We were surprised that their menu was so simple yet people raved about it. So we had pretty high expectations for this place. Honestly, I would have given this place five stars if it wasn't for the long piece of blonde hair that I found in my chicken wings. Had to return it. Thankfully, they took it off the bill. "
,,,,,"We started off with the general Jane's honey-fried chicken, which I thought was decent and had great flavor. We also got a double cheeseburger with the bacon and egg. I thought I ordered a double cheeseburger, but this was a triple pattiesThe sandwich was massive, and thank God we only ordered one to share, because I don't know how else we would have finished it. The patties were so juicy and flavorful and the bacon on top was just amazingly caramelized.. The egg on top just made everything taste so good. We also ordered a side of the crispy fries which were cooked to perfection. I love fries that our perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauces garlic aioli sauce was my favorite. And who knew putting a fried egg on top of fries would taste so good?  "
,,,,,"Also, we were shocked to see that the drinks were so cheap compared to other places. The tall boys included modelo, and some other beers that were 16 oz cans for only $3! The shot of house whiskey is also just $3! "
,,,,,"Overall, very happy with this place. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,Staff members did not wear masks. Plenty of outdoor dining!
,,,,,Came here on a Monday for lunch. Party of one. Sat at the bar (end of counter). Good seat to watch all the action in the kitchen. They seem to have a good rhythm and system in the kitchen. Busy! Most (if not all) tables were taken. Luckily I was one person and I love to sit at the counter/bar. 
,,,,,I walked almost 2 miles to eat here from my hotel. It was a really nice walk! Au Cheval has been bookmarked for a while and I finally made it :-) yay!!!!! 
,,,,,I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon (sauce on the side) and an order of fries. My burger and fries came out not too long after I ordered. Maybe 10 mins. 
,,,,,"Wow! I was so happy!!! The cheeseburger looked delicious. The bacon is thick cut. The fries looked perfect! The single cheeseburger comes with two patties, cheese, chopped red onions, pickles, and a mayo/mustard sauce which I got on the side because I'm not a big mustard fan. The sauce that that comes on the burger (which I got on the side) was delicious. Not heavy on the mustard taste at all. Also came with a spear pickle. The bacon was super thick. I am usually a fan of crispy bacon. The bacon was tasty but some of it was a little fatty for my taste. But tasty! I ended up taking the bacon off and putting it to the side and eating all the crispy parts. It was very good! Would I get the bacon again? Yes I would, but I would put it on the side not on the burger. The cheeseburger is perfect as is with meat cheese and a few of the condiments listed above. You also have an option to add a fried egg. I almost did that as well. But for my first time I really wanted to just try it with the meat and cheese. Next time I think I would try with the egg....but not needed. The meat is delicious and the cheese is delicious. I very much enjoyed this burger. And the fries. They were perfect! The fries came with an aïoli sauce for dipping. That was also delicious. Yummy yummy in my tummy!!!! My bill was about $30 bucks and I added a tip to almost $40. Worth it! "
,,,,,"The host that day that seated me (guy with I believe blonde hair that was wearing a hat and maybe a short ponytail) was super nice! My server was really nice too! Everyone was nice. Didn't feel rushed and was checked on. Service was easy, no complaints. They do have a bar but I didn't order a drink this time. "
,,,,,Was it worth me walking almost 2 miles to get here and almost 2 miles back??? ABSOLUTELY! F@*k yes!!!! I would do it again in a heartbeat! 
,,,,,I finished everything on my plate and everything in the fry container. 
,,,,,"If I ever visit Chicago again, and hopefully I do, I will definitely come back to Au Cheval fir a yummy burger and fries ;-p"

,,,,,"Of course this has been on my list for years. Decided to finally try to get in. We called before going and was told the wait was 20 minutes,  so we quickly drove their.  35 minutes later we arrived and was so excited there was no line.  However,  when I walked in to give our name the wait was over 2 hours, but we decided to wait. After about 90 minutes,  we went to check where we were in line and we were seated.  I was so excited to finally be sitting inside this iconic establishment. I ordered the single cheeseburger,  which is really a double with bacon. I have not eaten a beef burger in years, and this was by far worth the wait.  The griddled beef patty was tender and juicy. The bacon was thick and smoky. A piece of pork heaven.  And the aioli sauce was garlicky and smooth.   We had a side order of fries, topped with a fried egg and sauces on the side.  The fries were good, but I am not sure the egg did much.  It was a great to watch the cooks in the  open kitchen "
,,,,,Cook and prepare the burgers. They have a good selection of craft beers. 
,,,,,"The restraunt is small but the waiters do not rush you at all . The gastropub style compliment the food experience . I was not disappointed,  just wish the wait was not so long."
,,,,,"I've eaten quite a few burgers and quite a bit of bacon in my day, but this place really does them both on a whole different level. "
,,,,,Came on a Friday afternoon and only had to wait 30 minutes or so before being seated at the bar. Bartender was friendly and the beer selection was solid. 
,,,,,"Also had the duck heart gravy which was delicious, but the burger really steals the show here. A ""single"" is two patties by the way!"
,,,,,"Best burger I've ever had. Always a wait to eat here but no matter how long it is, it's worth it.  I get the burger with the egg and the bacon and it's *chefs kiss*.  Fries with the garlic aioli are a must too."
,,,,,"I had always wanted to try Au Cheval, but never wanted to deal with waiting.  I finally bit the bullet and went to the restaurant at 1pm on a Saturday.  The hostess initially told us the wait was 2 hours, but it was only an hour (so don't stray too far!!).  You put your name on a list and they'll text you when your table is ready, but you only have 10 minutes to get back to the restaurant.  "
,,,,,"We, of course, got the cheeseburger with bacon and the garlic fries.  Everything was pretty good, but it was a pretty rich (flavor wise and price wise) meal.  It's a good place to try once.  Was it the best burger I've ever had in my life?  No."
,,,,,Decent but not blow-your-mind good and definitely not worth the 2.5hr wait. 
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow, one burger, one cheeseburger, fries, a beer and their root beer float. We were so looking forward to trying their chicken liver but they were sold out for the night :( My favorite thing of the night was actually the aioli rush came with the fries. It's super garlic-y! "
,,,,,"It was fun to sit at the bar to watch all the food being made, and I think the lighting was better at the bar anyway - whereas it was pretty dimly lit at the tables. "
,,,,,Glad I got to try this place but wouldn't go back.
,,,,,I've been here twice while visiting the Chicago. You absolutely have to stop her and get a burger. (There's also Small Cheval but I've heard there's no comps) 
,,,,,"Two ways to get in and get a seat, and we had two different experiences. The first time we put our names on the waiting list and went next door for some drinks while we waited an hour. The second time we got there for an early lunch before they were open and got in line and we got a table as soon as they opened."
,,,,,I got the single with bacon both times and it was plenty of food. The fries were good too. 
,,,,,"Also, they have a great selections of local craft beers. I've had both Alarmist and Maplewood beers there."
,,,,,I'm...confused. Everyone seems to rave about this place and I've heard there's typically a line out the door but I felt the food and service were both average to subpar.
,,,,,"The food was very very heavy and I've enjoyed bone marrow frequently in the past but this one was so fatty to the point where it made me nauseous eating it. We were chasing the bone marrow with bites of the potato hash lmao. Additionally, the ratios in the dish were way off. I wish they gave an even ratio of marrow bones to toast. Without bread to spread the bone marrow on it becomes very difficult to eat let alone enjoy. The beef cheek marmalade was delicious but again, difficult to enjoy on its own without enough toast as it was very sweet. "
,,,,,The potato hash was tasty and I liked that there was a myriad of textures in the dish. This was done well. 
,,,,,"The burger was probably the biggest let down of the day. It was super salty at some parts and bland in others. Honestly, it reminded me of a McDonald's double cheeseburger because the cheese tasted exactly the same. It definitely threw me for a loop. "
,,,,,"Also, dining was very pricey ($3 just for adding an egg!) and there was an untold 3.25% service charge applied to our meal. Our party of 3 paid $100+ for lunch with two beers and only 2.5 dishes."
,,,,,"First time at Au Cheval and its definitely worth the hype of being not only one of the top burgers in Chicago, but in the entire country. The burgers are the must here with an option to add an egg and thick cuts of bacon. Burgers here are huge, a single is a double, and a double is a triple. All cooked perfectly and still pink inside. The waitlist can be long, but the 30-45 minute wait is worth it. No takeout orders at the moment. If burgers are your thing, definitely give Au Cheval a shot!"
,,,,,"We had three of our friends recommend this place, so we had to try! Our wait time was 2 hours! BUT, it cut down short to about an hour, so that was really great! Service was really great! Very attentive to your needs and check ups!"
,,,,,"Of course, we had to get the famous burger and I gotta say its is the most fresh, simple, juicy burger. Sometimes, simplicity is the good way to go. Coupled my burger with some really tasty beer. This place really hit the spot!"
,,,,,"I highly recommend this place. Be aware of the wait time! During the time we went (around May) we COULD NOT reserve our spots through phone. It had to be in person, so make sure to plan out your reservation because you could possibly wait a long time."
,,,,,"Again the best burger ever. I love this place! We arrived at about 1115 and had to wait like 45 min for a patty of 8. The service was good, we sat in the corner booths which was perfect. Ambiance is cool like an upscale diner."
,,,,,"- Single Cheeseburger (5/5): we added egg and bacon, and it was perfect. Could only finish half! The brioche bun was perfectly warm and crispy. Bacon was a good amount of salty and fatty. Just the perfect burger"
,,,,,- Crispy fries (5/5): the cheese sauce with it is amazing. So creamy and tasty. Love the crispness of the fries. Egg was a great touch
,,,,,Always a favorite. A must stop when visiting chicago!
,,,,,Probably my favorite burger I've ever had. I love this place so much. We ate outside and the ambiance was very cute. Service was great
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,- Cheeseburger (5/5): SO GOOD. Like unbelievably robust flavor. Perfection
,,,,,"- Crispy fries (5/5): Love the garlic aioli this came with. Fries were so yummy and crispy, and egg was the perfect touch"
,,,,,Drinks:
,,,,,- House whiskey (4/5): can't go wrong with $3 whiskey!
,,,,,I can't wait to go back here
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This place had mixed reviews among my friends. Some said it was the best burger ever, some thought it was simply ""okay."" I had to be the judge of that. "
,,,,,"As a loyal fan of In-N-Out here in California, it's hard to find a comparably expensive burger that makes me feel like it merits the price tag... but Au Cheval does that!! "
,,,,,"My husband and i were seated at the bar with no wait. I got the single cheeseburger with bacon and a side order of crispy fries. Let me preface this with - we had already eaten dinner and were quite full. This was second dinner. My husband whined ""I'm not hungry"" when I insisted on a second dinner (we're on vacation, we gotta make room!). Anyway, he scarfed down his burger in no time and it took me a lot of willpower to pack half for later, instead of finishing it too. IT WAS SO GOOD. The fluffy buns, charred patty, and the white shallot sauce.. yum. "
,,,,,"To add to the experience, service was amazing and quick. Everyone behind the bar/grill was so friendly and checked in on us while working so efficiently. Thoroughly impressed by this place."
,,,,,The best burger you'll EVER eat. 
,,,,,A friend recommend this place to us while we were visiting Chicago and we're glad we made a pit stop here. Little did I know this place is ranked on The Food Network for one of the best burgers in the USA! 
,,,,,"Order the single burger, trust me it's enough. The name is deceiving as it come with 2 patties. And don't forget to ADD BACON its worth the extra 5 or 6 bucks. It's cooked to perfection. The sunny side up egg is the perfect combo. You don't won't need any condiments, the burger is juicy enough. With the egg yolk running and the sweet and salty taste of the bacon are all the flavors you'll need. "
,,,,,Try to come before dinner rush. We arrived at 3:30 and still waited for an hour. This place is always busy. But there are plenty of bars in the are to choose from to work up an appetite!
,,,,,"If I could give this place more starts I would! My boyfriend and I had this place recommended to us and it was everything and more. We both got double cheeseburgers which really are like TRIPLE by the way and it was literally the best burger ever! Also, we got fries and a root beer float! Everything, EVERYTHING was delicious. Service A1, ambience very nice & cozy! I wish they had one in Maryland!"
,,,,,"It took us a couple attempts to get seated and eat here, but once I took a bite of the burger, all my annoyance melted away and I couldn't wait to come back."
,,,,,"That being said, here are some tips on getting in. No reservations, must come and put your name and number down. We've come on a Monday around 9pm before and the wait was still over an hour. Some people give up so your wait could be shorter than what they estimate. Once you get a text you only have 10 minutes to come back or they will give your seats away! We've come on a gloomy Tuesday evening after it had rained earlier and were able to get seated right away. Inside seating (table and counter) and outside patio."
,,,,,Food and drinks:
,,,,,"-Single cheeseburger (2 patties FYI!) with bacon and egg added: absolutely delicious. The bacon and egg really add depth and make the burger special. I feel like it would've been just a good burger without them and not the ""best burger in America."" It was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. "
,,,,,"-Side of fries (not to be confused with the separate order of fries and an egg): crispy when hot, but disappointingly mediocre as the meal went on"
,,,,,"-General Jane's honey fried chicken: really good, basically their copy of the sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken. Comes in 3 or 6 pieces"
,,,,,-Old fashioned: pretty good. Au Cheval seems to pride itself on its cocktails and it definitely didn't disappoint
,,,,,Heard great things about this place and  that it serves the best burger in Chicago. Boy was I not disappointed I literally crave this burger in my sleep!
,,,,,"Took us awhile to get seated because they DO NOT take reservations so be prepared to wait, but it is well worth it! I recommend going when they open if you're not keen on waiting outside, there are a few bars around the area that you can have a drink while you wait."
,,,,,"Double cheeseburger with egg and bacon (get the egg and bacon, thank me later)"
,,,,,General Jane's honey-fried chicken
,,,,,Crispy fries (trust me the egg is great)
,,,,,On a Sunday lunch we waited about one hour to get our table for two. 
,,,,,We ordered the single cheeseburger with egg and bacon as recommended for a total of $22 and the honey chicken. 
,,,,,I've personally found that the burger was pretty standard and I do had better ones. The honey chicken was simply too much. It was too sweet and greasy for us. We had three bites and boxed it to give to someone else. Overall we've had better food in Chicago and we're not a big fan of this place as it didn't meet up with the expectation from the ratings. Nonetheless it's a good but not outstanding burger.
,,,,,"Awesome place.  Known for their burgers, they didn't disappoint.  Had the Chopped Chicken Liver and some burgers with bacon.  The cooking is up front and in direct view.  Everyone was friendly and service was great.   Our server made some recommendations and offered lots of info.  "
,,,,,"A very ""hip joint"".    The chef Cam was so friendly.  "
,,,,,"I've never had a front of the house chef be so friendly and helpful.  While cooking on the line he took time to refill our glasses!   Who does that?  This place does!   Dessert was ""the icing on the cake"".  Absolutely fantastic!    Thank you to the GM (very nice) and to Cam."
,,,,,I've only ever been to Au Cheval at 11PM in the evening because I've found it to be impossible to come in at any other time. I can see why!
,,,,,"They are more than generous with their portion sizes. I mean, do you see that cut? You eat half a burger and you already want to knock out in a blissful food coma. "
,,,,,"Strangely enough though, the salad was one of my favorites. The burger is quite heavy (without being too greasy), so it was refreshing to have some fresh vegetables...albeit, the fresh vegetables are accompanied by huge slices of bacon. "
,,,,,"I wasn't as impressed by the fries, but then again, I've never been a fries kind of person. They weren't anything special compared to the standout burger and salad and bacon, and was more there so I could keep munching when I finished the meal."
,,,,,"I wish the desserts had a bigger selection, though. When I'm done with the massive meal, I still want something sweet to finish everything off! "
,,,,,"Overall, I would describe Au Cheval in a few words: Juicy, satisfying, and coma-worthy."
,,,,,Finally got to try this place after seeing it on Snapchat's top 10 burgers in America in 2016 lol. 
,,,,,It was an hour and half wait but ended up being an hour! 
,,,,,The burger was okay at first but got better when I got more into the center. I personally could do it without the egg. The bacon was really really good. I would just do the burger with the bacon. The double burger seemed more like a triple burger haha. Same goes for the single burger. Seemed like a double burger. 
,,,,,The fries are a lot. Feeds more than 2 people. Maybe even 3 if you decide to get other stuff also.

,,,,,"I finally got around to coming here in the summer 2019, but I didn't really get the hype. While the host was great and accommodating to get us seating with space (I was with a friend who had her bath in a stroller with her), the place itself was dark and our server was a bit rude. It was the middle of they day on a week day, so the wait wasn't too long, but it is frustrating that they didn't do reservations. I'm not sure if that has changed with Covid. "
,,,,,"We ordered the famous burger, but everything is a la carte. Seeing that, and knowing how hyped it is, I had high hopes for the burger. However, when I asked the server if I could get lettuce and tomato on there, he looked at me weirdly like I was crazy or something. I thought it was a strange reaction -- lettuce is a pretty standard topping. The burger itself was okay, but mine was pretty salty. It made it difficult to finish, but with how much it cost, I wasn't going to leave it. The fries were great, and as were the drinks, but overall I was a bit underwhelmed. I don't think I'd return."
,,,,,"There is an ongoing argument of where you can find the best burger in town. Stop arguing and just go here, also grab the Cobb salad and bacon while you're there!"
,,,,,Came here on a Monday evening with a friend.
,,,,,"We ordered cocktails and split the honey fried chicken, a cheese burger with bacon and the potato hash with duck gravy. "
,,,,,The decor gives the appearance of a rustic diner or tavern. But the dim lighting counters that with a more upscale and intimate vibe. 
,,,,,"There happened to be a table open as soon as we arrived, but otherwise the dining area was packed. The bar however, did have plenty of open seating."
,,,,,"The menu is small, featuring appetizers, shareable sides and drinks all on one page. Everything is a la carte (no entrees come with sides)."
,,,,,It's clear from the menu  that burgers are the star here--verified by our taste fest. The burger was by far the best tasting item we ordered (drinks included)--strongly recommend!
,,,,,"The fried chicken had a great flavor, but it was a mix of wings, legs and thighs, and we could've done without the thighs or just had all wings."
,,,,,We opted for the hash after noticing many tables left their fries untouched. 
,,,,,"It was certainly a large, shareable portion, but lacked a little seasoning complexity. Adding salt or cheese to the dish would probably make it better."
,,,,,"Overall, I'd return anytime I was in the mood for a great burger--maybe even stopping here for a bite before continuing on to one of the many places nearby for cocktails and the rest of the night."

,,,,,Au Cheval is a well-loved and super popular destination even years after their opening
,,,,,Being named as having the best burger in the nation (compared to Edzo's at #37) meant it was definitely on my list of eats
,,,,,"The burger is well worth the hype, but more for the rich condiments, fantastic egg, and out of this world bacon"
,,,,,All the other dishes are great including the potato hash with duck gravy and fries with mornay sauce and fried egg
,,,,,It's also carb overload and I'd expect to nap for a few hours eating here
,,,,,I'd skip the fried house-made bologna samdwich next time though it's very tasty
,,,,,The host sent a surprise order of general jane's honey fried chicken given our long wait for an outside table and that just makes me love this place more

,,,,,"Au Cheval (Chicago, IL)"
,,,,,Au Cheval accepts credit cards including AmEx.
,,,,,"This was it. One of the most popular restaurants in all of Chicago. Au freakin' Cheval. Yes, the rumors are true: the inside is small, the wait time to get a table is expected, and of course, the BOYGAHS are huuuugee! Luckily, for a snowy, slushy Tuesday evening, the wait wasn't so bad (about 20 mins around 5pm), so we got our little table inside one of the most exclusive clubs in West Loop. The restaurant itself is a cute, intimate space. Very little seating, dim lights, and a bar for extra seating. While the burgers are the main attraction here, they got some other items on their menu as well. Saw some brunch meals, and I think they said they're known for their chicken and bone marrow, of all things. These cats really take themselves very serious as chefs, and I cannot help but respect that. "
,,,,,"That being said, I ordered the dang ol single cheeseburger with bacon. I wanted a goody good burger, and I got one! Hoo boy, I enjoyed every bite of it. I mean, that thing was big! Nearly took me a good minute to finish that whole thing! And the fries too, wow. Salty as ever, but man were they satisfying. Ask for some specialty cheese on the side to go with it; fire combo. "
,,,,,"Great burger though. Was it the best burger I ever had in Chicago? Who knows, could be. I don't put burgers on such high enough pedestals for me to have an life changing experience. So yeah, that thang was good, but I don't think I had a 5 star experience here. Could be because of the ridiculous prices for everything here. I'm not gonna go into that though; it's a West Loop restaurant, probably one of the most successful ones in the neighborhood. They have demand flowing out the behind, so I get the high prices. "
,,,,,"Honestly, Au Cheval seems like the type of place you go to once to experience but don't try to seek out again, despite how great the meal was. No disrespect at all. I am so happy I finally got to try one of this place's wonderful burger after 5+ years of diving into Chicago's food scene, but it was not a perfect dining experience. Will still recommend it to anyone, and I mean ANYONE who loves a good burger."
,,,,,"We came with the intention of sharing a burger, which we did. But then, we were so blown away by half a burger that we ordered another to share, and finished every last bite. "
,,,,,"It's definitely very meaty, and you can definitely taste the difference in quality. The thick cut bacon was also very delicious, like pork belly with very good flavor. "
,,,,,No wait on a Monday at 11am. We were seated and served within 10 min.
,,,,,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! So so worth the wait! We came for lunch on a Friday and were told to wait 1-1.5 hours, we ended up waiting 1.5 hours for a table but just went to some nearby shops in West Loop so it wasn't too bad at all. "
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow to start and it might be the highlight of the whole meal. The bone marrow was quite oily but still very delicious, paired with the beef cheek marmalade was amazing. The toast was also perfectly toasted and so buttery and soft. The combination of the three was exquisite. "
,,,,,"The fries were also amazing, topped with a fried egg and garlic aioli: it was crispy and so so so good!!!! "
,,,,,I ordered the burger with fried egg and bacon which was super good as well but definitely pretty heavy as a meal esp after the two starters we ordered. The bacon is really thick cut and the fried egg together was delicious. It had really an abundance of flavor. 
,,,,,"Overall, this place is definitely top notch in Chicago and is so worth it!"
,,,,,Best burger I've ever had. Tbh when my sister told me that I was like hmmmm it either gonna be really good or it's gonna be over hyped and let me tell you-she was not wrong! 
,,,,,Texted with the fried chicken that was so good! Then got the single cheeseburger that's basically a double and the flavor and how it melted wow..... not over it. UNREAL 
,,,,,Their garlic aoli id delicious. 
,,,,,"Oh! And the service was amazing, the bartender gave us a free whiskey and pickle back (homemade pickle juice that's so delicious!) "
,,,,,100% recommend
,,,,,Came here early (around 5PM or so) on a weekday and so had no wait. Was seated pretty quickly and the food came out fast.
,,,,,"I initially got the burger without bacon and quickly realized the error of my ways, so I got a side of bacon and added it myself. The bacon really makes the burger, and with it, this burger really does live up to the hype! The fries weren't bad either and they value was good."
,,,,,"Overall, worth a trip. I'd recommend coming at off hours so you don't have to deal with the well advertised wait"
,,,,,"Fantastic burger and fries. A friend recommended this place and it was amazing. He said they're an upscale burger place and that they are. The burgers are cooked medium rare, medium or well only. I ordered medium. Everything must be ordered a la crate FYI. "
,,,,,The meat was so flavorful. I had the single but it still has two patties. I didn't get the bacon because I don't like sweet meat but I hear it's equally good by my dining counterpart. 
,,,,,The fries were hot and salted perfectly! 
,,,,,I also had a Paloma. It was good but didn't have much tequila and mezcal and wasn't worth the cost. I believe it was $14. 
,,,,,Can't wait to come back here.

,,,,,10/19/21 - OMG I finally came to Au Chaval today.  I've had this bookmarked on Yelp for a long time but I refuse to wait 2 hrs to get a burger.  I have eaten at Small Chaval before and thought while the burger was tasty it wasn't all that in terms of a burger that Wowed me.
,,,,,"Yesterday I was walking on Randolph on the NW corner of Randolph & Halstead.  It was an absolutely gorgeous outside sunny w/zero humidity & about 68 degrees.  I walked by Au Chaval and thought it's now or never.  The outdoor dining area only had 2 other people.  I was there so I checked in & grabbed a seat.  Au Chaval like  many places has their menu online on a QR code, but I already knew what I wanted I didn't need no stinking menu."
,,,,,"I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger cooked medium w/thick cut bacon & an egg on top w/gooey yolk.  OMG this masterpiece arrived.  It was an absolute work of art.  As I looked at this incredible piece of food like many people I started to photograph it before I dug in & consumed it.  Sometimes you bookmark a restaurant your expectations are so high when you finally eat there it's a bit of a disappointment, but for me this wasn't the case w/Au Chaval.  This masterpiece not only met my expectations but exceeded it.  As I started eating this beautiful piece of art as the gooey egg yolk leaked onto & over the thick cut bacon & cheesy burger making an absolutely decadent gooey mess.  I savored every single bite & even thought of getting another one lol, but my heart & wallet said NO"
,,,,,I didn't even go inside of Au Chaval to see the interior cause it was too beautiful outside
,,,,,"I have been here multiple times, and there is reason I keep coming back! Superb service, great food, and romantic ambiance!! "
,,,,,"The last time I was here, we ordered the Chilaquiles and they were phenomenal! Of course their cheeseburger is on point, that's what all the hype is about! I did not get a photo of the bologna sandwich, I did order it and we shared it amongst our group. I'm not a big fan of bologna, so it didn't blow me away, but I just wanted to try it. We also had to get a side of extra bacon because why do I need a reason. We have ordered the fries with the fried egg on top, that did not disappoint either, just wasn't feeling at this time so just ordered regular fries. We always get our food with a Coke! "
,,,,,"If you've already been here before, make a plan to return! If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for?"
,,,,,Voted best meal of my vacation - and I could easily make the case for going here again on my next trip to Chicago.  This is exactly the kind of place I love.
,,,,,"There is a counter where you can watch the chefs. The menu is limited but all carefully curated.  The inside is really dark and old school (but with windows out to the street), the service is friendly and efficient. "
,,,,,"I had read something that said this was the best burger in Chicago. So yep, I am in.  They are also famous for their homemade bologna sandwich.  "
,,,,,"There were 3 of us, so we ordered (to split): a single cheeseburger (Added the house-made thick cut bacon - which was incredible), the bologna sandwich, and the fries with an egg (comes with 2 sauces: an aioli and a Morney sauce)."
,,,,,"The burger is in my top 10 burgers ever. I will also dream about that bologna sandwich piled high. And I am better the fries are done in maybe duck fat, they were decadent and perfectly crispy."
,,,,,The waiter said that there is a dish at brunch we should come back for...eggs and foie gras. (apparently the eggs are cooked in the fat of the foie.)  I am drooling just typing this.
,,,,,We decided to go here because this has been suggested to us as the best burger in all of Chicago. To be honest we were both a bit disappointed because we felt the burger could be better.
,,,,,"The service, staff, and everyone has been super friendly and helpful in guiding us through the menu and figure if our what to order. We finally decided on a single cheeseburger (which comes on two patties), bacon, and egg, as well as the foie gras scrambled eggs. "
,,,,,The food came out pretty fast and looks really good but the burger itself tasted meh. There was actually not too much taste to it. We were expecting something out of this world but we felt let down by it. Maybe our expectation was too high but we felt this place has been hyped up too much. Our favorite burger place is the Crab Cellar and we have been looking all over the place for a new burger place after they shut down the place. Unfortunately this burger is not memorable enough to say that this is on the top of my list.
,,,,,The foie gras scrambled eggs on the other hand was really really good. The scrambled eggs were a bit salty but super duper fluffy. Compare it with the foie gras and caramelized onions and they are chef's kiss
,,,,,"For the price point of everything, we personally don't feel like the burger was worth it. But do get the foie gras scrambled eggs when you have the chance."
,,,,,"Overall the atmosphere and the staff are great, but it is overhyped and more a tourist spot."
,,,,,At Cheval does not take reservations. We came here on a Thursday evening but we were turned away as they already had a 2 hr waitlist. A tip that the hostess gave us was to come here earlier in the day (preferably when they opened) to put our names down for a table. Which is what we did on Sunday and got seated after about an hr. 
,,,,,"The burger was worth the wait! Definitely come hungry as the burger was super filling. We also got the bone marrow to share, which came with toast and the marmalade"
,,,,,Recently made another visit to this lovely place. It is nice to see that not much has change in terms of their bad ass burgers! This is a must stop whenever visiting Chicago.
,,,,,They now have outdoor seating to help with COVID. We got there around 11:45 and didn't have to wait to be seated.
,,,,,I ordered a double cheeseburger with egg and bacon and it did not disappoint. The wait is long and they do not take reservations. 
,,,,,Pro tip: Put your name down before your hungry and go bar hopping around the area and wait for the call when your table it ready!
,,,,,"The cheeseburger was well salted. The egg was runny and herby. The bacon was thick and marinated! It was well worth my ""wait"". "
,,,,,We got to sit at the bar and got to witness the hard work that goes into keeping this restaurant moving! #respect
,,,,,"This place was awesome. The staff were very personable, the chicken was crispy with spicy/tangy  sauce that I saved for my fries too. Then the burger was juicy with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg. The bacon was thick and had a little sweetness to it. Even the pickle was a well seasoned balance to the meal. Finally...and really first...the drinks are pretty good. The Strange Brew is something I'd drink afor every meal."
,,,,,Overall I'd suggest eating here but get there early. They don't take reservations and they fill quickly. So if they open at 11 be there at 10:45am lol
,,,,,"I might be the only person who thinks this, but I did not think the burger was worth it's hype. Now, there could be a few different factors at play here. I was dairy free for an entire year during COVID and this was my first cheeseburger ""back at it."" But that being said, I got a strong plastic-y flavor that came along with it."
,,,,,"However, I will say there were a few items on the menu I would 100% go back for. Their kale caesar was divine and this is random but their root beer float was INSANE. I found out later they make their own root beer so that is definitely the reason for it's unreal flavor."
,,,,,I also had a bite of my friend fried bologna (a sandwich I have not had since childhood) that was really quite yummy. Could be a harsh review of the burger but just my personal opinion!
,,,,,"Odds are, you've heard all the hype. I had high expectations and can confidently say they were met."
,,,,,"Au Cheval is a no-frills type restaurant. The food is top-notch (details to come), but first a few things to note: "
,,,,,"They do not take reservations ahead of time- rather, you show up however early and put your name on a waitlist. For reference, I went on a Friday evening. I showed up around 5PM to get my name on the waitlist (seating is limited so large parties beware.). My friends and I then walked around the city for a few hours until we got the text that our table was ready (9PM- would not recommend showing up later than 5PM because they stopped letting in new diners shortly after we received our food), then had the best burgers ever!!!"
,,,,,"Perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth patties. Also gave me a new appreciation for cheese. The only thing I regret is not getting a side of the thick cut bacon for myself (the small piece I had was insanely delicious). Our table also had a side of fries (not pictured, but they were piping hot, crispy, and perfectly paired with the aioli)"
,,,,,"100% worth that 4 hour wait. I will definitely be back, hopefully to try drinks + other menu items, but I cannot foresee a future in which I come to Au Cheval and am able to resist ordering the cheeseburgers. Final shoutout to the staff too- everyone was so accommodating :)"
,,,,,"This is a great spot. Definitely highlight of the Chicago trip, but get there early, even if no one is outside yet there will be a line. It's worth it."
,,,,,"We did not get there early and had to wait. The upside is they take your number and text you so you are free to walk around and check out local shops etc. Don't show up starving, grab a pre-meal drink next door, and you'll be fine."
,,,,,Our server was top notch. If you can sit inside because it's fun watching the cooks work the grill. Get a beer. The cocktails were good but the burgers go best with a craft brew. Our server made great recommendations- I'd trust them.
,,,,,"The food is really good- worth the price point. I went in expecting something like umami burger. This is nothing like that. The burger was like a 3-star chef's version of a McDonald's hamburger- it's a solid bun, two patties that aren't super thick, house pickles, American cheese, sauce. Super simple, but delicious."
,,,,,"Is this ""the best burger in America?"" Not in my opinion but my boyfriend would disagree with that. I like a thicker patty, but this is the best pub burger I've ever had. Would definitely go back!"
,,,,,800 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"These are the best burgers I have ever had. Not in the city, not in the state, the best I've ever had! "
,,,,,"I so appreciate a restaurant that does one thing and does it really, really well, Au Cheval is that place. A restaurant under the Hogsalt restaurant group, its no surprise the service and food is so dan good. "
,,,,,"I went on a perfect summertime Chi day and the wait was about 90 minutes (which is apparently short). I didn't think much of it, it's summer in West Loop. I grabbed some drinks nearby until they texted me that my table was ready. The food was more than worth the wait. "
,,,,,"I ordered a cheeseburger, added an egg, and my partner and I shared the duck heart gravy poutine which was DIVINE! A few things to keep in mind if you visit. "
,,,,,"1. Be prepared to wait. If you don't want to wait to dine in, order for pick up. These burgers are just as good to go (we've ordered this way from their sister biz @smallcheval)."
,,,,,"2. Add the egg, always."
,,,,,3. Feeling famished? Add the generous portion of thick bacon too.
,,,,,"4. GET THE HASHBROWNS. Duck heart gravy, crispy potatoes, cheese, a perfectly runny yolk. Order it. Just do it."
,,,,,5. Wash it down with a cocktail. I recommend their house Paloma.
,,,,,"If you're visiting the Chi, please do not leave without this West Loop staple."
,,,,,Definitely worth the hype! This is a great place to make plans to go to if you have someone coming in from out of town or you have a lot to catch up on with a friend because the wait is definitely LONG. My friend and I put our names in around 5:15PM and were seated about 8:30PM. In the meantime we hopped over next door to the bar and had a few beers there to catch up. I would definitely plan to get there as soon as they open to put your name in because the wait can be long and I have heard of people showing up at or slightly after 6:30 and not being able to put a name in because they are booked for the night.
,,,,,This is probably one of the best burgers I've had! Cooked really nicely and no fuss/easy to eat without falling apart. I didn't feel heavy or like I had eaten too much afterwards. A friend and I went and got our own burgers and split fries which was the perfect amount of food.
,,,,,"Overall, I highly recommend checking this place out if you're in Chicago but be prepared for the wait and to keep busy during the wait time!"
,,,,,"Best bacon I've ever had!  Burger was delicious. There's typically a wait, but Au Cheval is worth it."
,,,,,"If you want to avoid the line, get there just before opening on Saturday (10:45am)."
,,,,,Most delicious and photogenic burger around! And don't miss out on the house-cut fries.. the best part? The GARLIC AIOLI SAUCE!
,,,,,If you are a burger enthusiast then Au Cheval is where you
,,,,,"need to be! Out of this world burgers, with mouth-watering fresh cut french fries with aioli dipping sauce. They also have the coolest music playlist. Great atmosphere. Very Chicago-chic. They don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. I'd recommend putting in your name and going somewhere nearby for a quick drink."
,,,,,"Another Chicago staple! My sister & I have been trying to get to Au Cheval for some time now. Chicago is indeed my favorite city, but I don't get there as frequently as I would like. The last time we tried to go there was a 2-3 hour wait . This time we went ahead of time to put our name on the list because we already knew there was going to be a long wait. The restaurant isn't very big & the bar is pretty much the kitchen too. The burger was very juicy & delicious! & of course I had to try it with an egg + bacon yummmm!!!"
,,,,,"This place is typically packed every time I've gone on the weekend, it's about an hour to an hour and a half wait time. This time we went on a Thursday around 5pm and we were quickly seated which was a nice surprise. However we are always willing to wait and have drinks at another bar until it's our turn. The burgers here are one of the best burgers I've had around the area, they are classic burgers but done extremely well. "
,,,,,"We tried the chicken for the first time and it was amazing, it has a slight spicy kick to it which was a unexpectedly pleasant. The staff was friendly enough, only thing I wasn't happy about was being brought the check before asking if we wanted dessert. But overall it's a great place has a nice vibe and excellent food."
,,,,,Quite possibly my favorite burger. You have to get here early as they are always packed. But service is quick. 
,,,,,Everyone is very nice. The inside is super cool. Menu is small but has exactly what you need and it is done very well. 
,,,,,"If you love burgers like I do, you have to go. Check out my photos"
,,,,,The best burger I have ever eaten. 
,,,,,The burg is delicious and very juicy BUT the bun magically holds everything together without falling apart OR being too much bread. 
,,,,,"Skip the egg and bacon, eat the burg the way God intended. Also be prepared to wait. "
,,,,,Worth it.
,,,,,Sadly did not meet up to the hype.
,,,,,Be cautious a single cheeseburger has 2 patties and a double has 3 patties.
,,,,,The patties were over seasoned which made the burger salty.
,,,,,"The fries were delicious, the staff was very friendly."
,,,,,They are strict on following vaccination protocols.
,,,,,Burgers are on the pricier side and they also charge a surcharge so be aware.
,,,,,2 burgers and fries came out to be $50+ tip.
,,,,,@auchevaldiner - if you can sit at the bar and just watch the show!  The chefs look like a choreographed dance team. They are amazing. 
,,,,,Also the food!  We had the chopped chicken livers - they are served with salted butter! So is rich on rich but so worth all the calories. 
,,,,,Then we got a single burger with bacon. The bacon is thick cut pork belly and could be it own sandwich. The single burger is huge and looks like a double. The double burgers leaving the kitchen where massive.
,,,,,Not sure you need the fries with egg - just get fries with the garlic aïoli.
,,,,,"Best burger I have ever had so far. Please please please give them a try if you're in the area. Yes, the wait might be an hour or more but it is so worth it. I waited a solid hour and it was so worth it. So glad I did. "
,,,,,I order the cheeseburger with bacon. Wow. Fries. Wow. Then they brought out this garlic aolli. Wow. Best tasting sauce. My goodness. They put so much love into their cooking and it truly shows. Even the burger buns had such a nice buttery and flaky taste. Everything was bursting with flavor. I definitely cannot wait to go back
,,,,,The dessert! Ahhh. I wish I knew how to spell it out correctly but it is a French pasty tower essentially and it was amazing. So damn good. Tasty. 
,,,,,This is a place that will forever stay in my mind. As a foodie and as a burger connoisseur this definitely hit the spot!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Perhaps they had an off night. Everything was... good... but modes not compare to places down south.
,,,,,Couldn't wait to try this place when we visited Chicago. We tried several dishes and none of them disappointed: 
,,,,,Bone marrow: very smooth and decadent. 
,,,,,"Beef tendon chips: probably our least favorite dish, but still good. very crispy. "
,,,,,Gnocchi with oxtail ragu: BEST DISH. Hands down. Could have eaten three of these.
,,,,,Grilled Octopus: amazing.
,,,,,Can't wait to go back!
,,,,,One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Guess this is the reason to get more than 6000+ reviews. 
,,,,,"This was my first time to visit, and have no idea how to order and which item to order. Thanks yelp, we just followed the recommendations from yelp. Everything is simply good"
,,,,,"So delicious. The chicken thighs are to die for. Unfortunately, the new location doesn't have the charm of the old place."
,,,,,"WORTHY OF 5 STARS. Some of the finest cuisine I've had in Chicago. The pork shoulder was so soft . The octopus is way good. Grilled broccoli was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. As I'm typing, my mouth is salivating rn. No wait at all for me when I went. Nice servers. Fantastic. Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Straight up."
,,,,,"What a great way to start the trip with a great meal at the Purple pig! Love the ambiance and the food. The place was really busy and a great local place to hang out. They have amazing selection of wines/drinks. We tried about 5 different appetizers and our favorites were the bone marrow, squid and octopus."
,,,,,Great food and Great customers service in my opinion. I will recommend to my friends and family.
,,,,,"The taste is just OK I think, and all the dishes we ordered are very oily. We ordered 3 small dishes first, thinking about ordering more after we finished these. The smoked pig tongue is very salty, I had to drink a lot of water afterwards. Then, there came the famous pig's ear. It is deep fried and you cannot tell that is pig ear. It is oily and tastes just like fried noodle strips. Then the broccoli, it is flavorful at first bite, but again super oily and the sauce is very strong and salty that you won't want to eat it anymore."
,,,,,"So, after these 3 appetizers, we didn't really want to order anymore."
,,,,,"The servants are friendly and nice, though. The place is very small and packed, which is a little bit uncomfortable."
,,,,,"Food was good but we were still hungry. Portions small and pricey. The service was good tho. They kept on coming to check on us to the point of it's annoying bc we weren't done eating and they're already getting your plate. Their food presentation was excellent and tasty as well, the only thing is very small portions. So don't expect too much if u come hungry but I think it's nice just to hang out with friends ."
,,,,,Okay so I have to say I went twice to this place while we were in Chicago. I feel like you could fall in love with all the food and never feel like you are tired of this place. First off the location is cool and very convenient near the water. There is always a wait some days better then others but they will get you a drink while you wait and it doesn't feel so long. I love there sangria had probably more than I should have but hey when in Rome as they say or in this case Chicago. We tried a variety of options and never had anything we didn't like.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Amazing! 
,,,,,For appetizer I had octopus and although it was a little salty but it was one of the best that I have had so far. I have tried octopus in different mediterranean countries and this one was definitely good. 
,,,,,I also tried the 'Razor Clams A La Plancha' and it was very unique! This was my first time trying it and really liked it. Besides the taste I LOVED its look and how they present it. Check out the photo I took.
,,,,,For my mail course I tried black stuffed ravioli on a bed of creamy corn risotto. It was fabulous!
,,,,,Enjoy!
,,,,,"I was in Chicago for a conference and after looking at a reviews we decided to try it out. This is place is a gem! A must visit if you are in Chicago!! Indoor has limited seating and have shared tables. They don't take reservation and usually the wait time is ~1 hour. However, we were lucky and got seated quickly. "
,,,,,"Their menu is Mediterranean inspired and has shareable portion. We ordered polenta, chicken kebob and cauliflower. All the dishes were amazing! I personally loved polenta dish. Presentation was great, beautiful dishes! "
,,,,,Service was great. Our server recommend some dishes. I highly recommend this place.
,,,,,"I was under the impression that this place served small tapas and plates but everything I ordered was bigger than expected. We expected a long wait and were told over the phone that the wait could be 2-4 hours during the dinner hour so we decided to come at around 10pm to avoid the wait. We still had to wait for a table but we were given the option of ordering from the full menu and eating at the outside patio if we wanted. We decided to stand around a table outside and order from the menu (no seats but we didn't mind standing and eating since the table was tall). Eventually, by the time we figured out what to get, we did end up getting seated inside. "
,,,,,"Amongst my four friends, we ordered the Tom & Jerry steak, the turkey leg confit, and the pork shoulder. We later realized that it was a lot of meat for a late night meal. Everything was really good but because we chose all meat dishes, it did get a bit salty without some vegetables to balance it out. "
,,,,,TOM & JERRY STEAK (Meant for at least 2 people)
,,,,,"This was the most expensive item we ordered but because it was meant for at least two people, it's actually on par with the other individual entrees. There is bone marrow in the center that our server said you can spoon out and put on top of your meat like ""butter"". Steak overall was very good especially with the sauce. "
,,,,,"TURKEY LEG CONFIT WITH CRISPY LENTILS, NAPA CABBAGE, & AGRODOLCE "
,,,,,"I never thought I would like lentils but it gave a nice crunch and I found this dish balanced well when paired with the cabbage. The meat was tender and it came apart off the leg very easily. Since the turkey leg is so huge, I think you can easily share this dish with a friend. "
,,,,,MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOES
,,,,,The pork shoulder was also quite tender but I think I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy more as the gravy was delicious. I had the highest expectations for this dish since it seemed to be the most mentioned in the reviews but it actually fell short of my expectations. 
,,,,,"If you like pork and meat, then this restaurant is the place for you. Everything we tried was delicious and flavorful but it does verge on being too salty at certain bites. I wouldn't wait two hours for here but I would come back again at around the same time at night when the wait is way shorter and it is less crowded. I imagine that the wait is this long probably because people are spending a whole hour to finish up their bottle of wine."
,,,,,"Loved this option for a decadent celebratory meal - without completely breaking the bank. Stopped in for wine and a shared meal, loved the ambiance. "
,,,,,The only bummer was that we were seated right by the host stand which meant that the staff conversations were a little distracting from our own. I'd urge the management to ensure that the staff kept their convos quieter near that front table. 
,,,,,"Other than that, gorgeous meal!! And impeccable service by our waiter."
,,,,,Let me start by saying that the milk braised pork shoulder is overrated. It's very good but not the best thing on the menu. Kind of stinks I wasted an entree on that dish but I'll get something different next time.
,,,,,The eggplant caponata is purely amazing - honestly the best dish we had. Pork ribs were really good but a bit pricey for what you get. For dessert we had the beignet with ricotta and chocolate chips and OMG. Definitely get that as a finish.
,,,,,"We were crazy fortunate to have a two-top become available just as we walked in. Otherwise, wait time would have been 90 minutes."
,,,,,The service and management was excellent. I had an issue with my drink and it was promptly taken care of. The manager came by to ask for feedback as to how they can do a better job going forward. Why doesn't every restaurant do this?!
,,,,,"Overall, really good experience. Great place for a date or with friends. Please don't bring your kids - they won't eat most of the stuff on the menu and the environment is very adult-ish."
,,,,,"This place did not wow me like I was hoping it would after reading the reviews and seeing the photos. The wait was long so make sure you either go on off peak times or be prepared to wait. They do text you though so you can get in a little site seeing while waiting for your table. Now, onto the food..."
,,,,,"Turkey leg - massive! Make sure you're with a large party if you plan on ordering this. If you love extremely salty, this is your dish. Although I do love salt, I felt this dish was beyond salty and was only able to eat a few bites before calling it quits "
,,,,,"Milk braised pork shoulder - this was the first dish that came out and by far the best this we ate. Extremely flavorful. It was so good that I was excited for everything else, but then was let down."
,,,,,Octopus cavetelli - very peppery. My kids were not able to eat this as they thought it was too spicy
,,,,,Grilled octopus - the lemon really over powered this. It was so sour! The octopus itself was cooked really well though. It had a nice char and was very tender.
,,,,,"Although the decor and service was amazing, I really didn't think the wait was worth it. The menu is large though, so maybe I just ordered completely wrong"
,,,,,This was a bit of a disappointing experience. Super crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fine it was the food that was very average. Nothing was horrible and nothing was great. Wouldn't recommend. Too many other spots that offer better bar tripe food.
,,,,,"Awesome place! Great food and atmosphere. Food came out quick and delicious. Ordered the octopus, squid, whipped feta, bone marrow, beets, and lamb. Paired all with red wine and stout. Split among 3 of us . Highly recommend! Put down our name. They estimated 40 min wait but sat us in 10 min."
,,,,,"A very eclectic restaurant. It's family-style seating here and next to strangers.  Everything here is a small plate meant to be shared kind of like tapas. The menu changes daily and there are a few every day items such as the fried deviled eggs.  We ordered a rigatoni with chicken Bolognese sauce that was excellent, a beet dish with whipped goat cheese that was excellent, shrimp with blood sausage, and rabbit with sausage. Everything was cooked order and really good. The seating situation though can get cramped and untenable at times.  It's very noisy and very crowded and there is generally a way to get in. The house mixed drinks are excellent and interesting.  Service was very good and we were constantly attended two with plates being put in front of us and removed all night long.    Purple pig is definitely a place you want to try at least once."
,,,,,"So happy to have stumbled upon this hidden gem. At first, we were turned off by the name. It's called the Purple Pig and we don't eat pork so we thought we wouldn't be able to have anything on the menu... but the place kept popping up so we decided to look at the menu and give it a go. "
,,,,,To our surprise- there were tons of none pig options and the food was amazing. We came on a busy weekend in the summer. They don't take reservations and we had to put our name on the list for an hour wait. It was worth every second. 
,,,,,Chicago is known for its foodie scene and this place fits right into the reason for the hype. 
,,,,,The most memorable dish was the duck - it's a big serving and my husband didn't leave the table till he finished it and could barely breathe. He couldn't stop and said it was the best duck he had in his life. 
,,,,,The appetizers were also amazing as was dessert and the best part was that we didn't have to break the bank to come here. 
,,,,,We stayed in Chicago for two days and came here twice (we would have come back again if we had more time). 
,,,,,A must try and I hope something similar would open in our area one day...
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Have you ever had one of those days when everything leading up to a dinner goes south?
,,,,,Like the weather changes suddenly and you are wearing a winter coat and its 80 degrees outside?
,,,,,"Or, you call an uber for 2 but your driver shows up with 3 people inside and insists you didnt request the correct number of seats?"
,,,,,"Maybe you show up at the restaurant and theres a 45 minute wait time so you decide to go to the store next door and find yourself the perfect pair of pants and just as you are trying them out you get notified that your table is ready? And, you finally make it to the restaurant sans the perfect set of pants sweating profusely from the short jog outside only to realize that your table is positioned at a angle from the sun perfectly oriented to give you first degree burns. "
,,,,,"Well guess what? All of these things happened to us, not one, not two, ALL OF THE ABOVE!"
,,,,,"Now that I have got all of that out of my system, let me tell you why The Purple Pig gets 4 stars anyway. The food at this restaurant is fantastic guys, literally everything we tried was delicious, you must try their grilled broccoli and the duck confit, both best in their class. The drinks were good but we missed the joy of having our moscow mule in a copper cup."
,,,,,We look forward to coming back someday and will hopefully have better luck with everything else next time around.
,,,,,Excellent gastro-pub type set up offering very innovative and delicious cuisine in small plates that are very affordable. 
,,,,,"We got here early and even then, at 5PM, the place was nearly full. We managed to score a high top with four seats free in the communal section and began ordering drinks and snacks. "
,,,,,"The Star Wars fan in me made the Rebel Scum cocktail and no-brainer to start with. It was an excellent combination of Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Borghetti Espresso Liqueur, demerara and Bertagnolli Grappa di Amarone. We later moved on to the Colombian Old Fashioned  which was 13 Parce 8 Year Rum, Cruzan Black Strap Rum and Amaro d'Arancia with Demerara. One of my top 5 cocktails of all time. I think I could have had 10 (I think I may have)."
,,,,,"For our shared plates we did the house made n'duja (don't miss it), octopus with potatoes and salsa verde, deviled eggs, pork belly and Huevos Rotos con Chorizo which were amazing."
,,,,,"Service was attentive and helpful, making suggestions and offering some ordering tips. The setting was comfortable without being stuff and the prices, for the quality of innovative food we received, were great."
,,,,,Been meaning to get to this place for quite a while now! We were seeing a show at House of Blues and decided that we would go early and see if we could snag a seat at the bar which definitely worked in our favor! 
,,,,,"I got there at about 5 and it was quickly filling up. When I walked in there were about 6 empty seats at the bar. I made a beeline and sat down, was greeted quickly by the bartender, cannot remember his name but he provided great service! He was very knowledgeable about drinks, recommendations, and ingredients. "
,,,,,"We started off with the soprassata and a cheese that I can't even remember now but it was very bold and very funky! Great flavor tho! We ordered the crispy pig ears, salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette, and huevos rotas con chorizo! We also got a steak dish that was good but I didn't get a pic and the name of it escapes me now. But Everything was so good! I couldn't stop eating the beets and I wish I had more people so that I could try more things! We will definitely be back."
,,,,,"Oh, GREAT drink menu as well. Tons of selections on all liquors and wine."
,,,,,"3 years later since my unimpressed review, the bf and I visited Chicago this past weekend. Since he is a huge pork-fan, we thought we'd give The Purple Pig another try (and he could choose off the menu with more expertise as a true appreciator of pork)."
,,,,,"For lunch, we ordered the pork neck gravy and ricotta, the pork blade steak, and the roasted cauliflower. I HIGHLY recommend the first two for a great representation of what Purple Pig has to offer. The pork neck gravy tasted like pulled pork and was so rich and creamy with a great tomato base. The pork blade steak was to die for - the glaze on the pork was some rendition of nutty honey and was paired so well with a nduja. The updated 5-star is for these two dishes!"
,,,,,The cauliflower had a great char on it but had two dashes of too much vinegar and became a little acidic mid-way in.
,,,,,"We arrived at 12 pm on a weekday and there was no line (while if you come for dinner, there will most certainly be a line)."
,,,,,It pains me whenever my dining experience does not match that of others at an esteemed restaurant... but here it goes.
,,,,,The good: 
,,,,,- Very friendly and helpful staff: We came in around 6 pm on a Sunday and it was packed. We found chairs in front of the bathroom and the hostess came around twice to make sure she got our names correct for when our table would become available. The speculated hour wait turned out to be 45 minutes instead. Our server was also attentive without being overbearing and came to check up on us multiple times. 
,,,,,"- Wine list: The choices are expansive, covering both old and new world wines. The prices start from $10+ for a glass, which is competitive with prices at other popular establishments."
,,,,,"- Menu options: The different and creative dishes on the menu are so interesting. I think the name of ""The Purple Pig"" really fits with what the chefs are doing here with twists and whimsical surprises in terms of what you could serve up with a pig. I have never seen pig's feet on a menu until dining here."
,,,,,The not-so-good:
,,,,,- Pig ear with kale: Too much fry and not enough pig ear. I couldn't taste the meat at all and there was so much fry compared to the kale. That paired with the fried egg rendered this dish to be quite heavy. We didn't finish this dish.
,,,,,"- Mussels: Be aware of the cilantro in this dish! I have never had it prepared with cilantro before and the addition of this vegetable gave the mussels and its broth a fragrance that I couldn't warm up to. Plus, the mussels were so tiny!"
,,,,,- Bone marrow: I wish the salad wasn't so heavily dressed given the super buttery bone marrow and the super buttered toasts. I felt that there was nothing to cut through the fattiness of the dish. We didn't finish this dish either.
,,,,,I would come back to try other dishes besides these three but I recommend ordering one dish at a time to check with the level of heaviness so that you can balance it out more rather than ending up like us with three heavy dishes.
,,,,,Worth the wait!  This place is always busy. I came here for dinner and the wait was 2.5 hours... Which meant I would have to eat at 11:30pm which I couldn't do. But i did come here the next morning right when they opened and we didn't have to wait. I actually got really lucky because it was already packed and there were only a handful of seats open.
,,,,,"Food: well you know I had to try the bone marrow. I demolished that like no tomorrow. Basically, it was delicious so you need to order it when you come here!"
,,,,,2nd dish: we ordered the pork blade that came with a small side of salad. It was pretty good but not as amazing as the bone marrow. 
,,,,,3rd dish: I ordered two types of cheeses with fig and pita chips. I wish I ordered this first before I demolished a giant piece if pork. But everything I ate was really good here. 
,,,,,"Overall, I give this a 5/5 because of the fast service, great food selections and portion sizes, and not too expensive but still worth the money food prices. "
,,,,,I will be back!
,,,,,We celebrated 4th of July in Chicago. Tried this restaurant recommended by my chef son. Their menu are very interesting. We ordered couple from the menu to try. It was a nice experience. The staff and manager are very accommodating. They welcomed us knowing that we are from Las Vegas and came to try their food.
,,,,,Perfection.
,,,,,"With no reservations, we had a short wait on a busy Saturday evening. I loved that they had a nice area to wait and order drinks. We didn't wait nearly as long as we expected. The waitress was the perfect balance of friendly and unobtrusive. "
,,,,,"Our first plate came out SO fast, and every plate after that was perfect timing as we were finishing the last. Everytime we thought we found our favorite dish, the next was even better. My favorites:"
,,,,,Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter
,,,,,Flavors are perfect together!
,,,,,Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes + Crispy Lentils
,,,,,So tender and not a bit too fatty
,,,,,Ricotta Gnudi with Carmelized Brown Butter and Black Truffle
,,,,,Melts in your mouth!
,,,,,"4 plates and a dessert were just right for my boyfriend and me. They give you exactly the right serving, not too much, and not just a couple bites."
,,,,,"I also really appreciated that this place had a casual feel. The food and service was 5 star, but felt comfortable and welcoming. They weren't trying to be fancy for the sake of being fancy."
,,,,,"Very good, but be prepared to wait. My friend came by and put our names down first, and even on a Monday night, there was a 1-hour wait at 8pm. "
,,,,,"I came with one other person, but I'd recommend coming here with at least 4-5 people. The dishes are all small portions, so coming with a bigger groups allow you to try more dishes without breaking the bank too much. "
,,,,,"Food: Octopus A La Plancha, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Chicken Thigh Kebabs"
,,,,,Drinks: Colombian Old Fashioned -- which was bomb!
,,,,,"I think my favorite was probably the octopus, it was super flavorful -- not too chewy or tough. I heard you can't go wrong with anything you ordered, so I definitely want to come back and try other dishes!"
,,,,,"Worth the wait! If you're planning on a romantic quiet place, don't line up. If you're looking for good food and to make some friends, definitely get in line! Even before they open, there's already people hungry and waiting to eat. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations so don't bother calling ahead, just prepare at least 30+ mins of wait time. "
,,,,,"The servers are super friendly here. They have a very small kitchen for the huge amazingness that flows out of it. Go with what they recommend or dare to try something unique. There's plenty of options and something for everyone. The food here was so delicious, me and the BF came twice in one trip. Here's what we ordered:"
,,,,,"Pigs Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg - the most yummy thing we got. Break the egg, mix in the oozing runny yolk, then the softness of the egg blends perfectly with the crispyness of kale and pigs ear. The salty ear and the pickled peppers also compliment each other. "
,,,,,Broccoli with roasted garlic & anchovy vinaigrette - never liked broccoli as much as now. It was crunchy with a light tang from the vinaigrette. Very refreshing and not overwhelming. 
,,,,,Roasted Bone Marrow With Herbs - melts like butter. The scooped out marrow goes on top of a toasted brioche slice and add some greens to put a hint of bite. Wonderful. 
,,,,,Pork Blade Steak with 'nduja & honey - tender and juicy. More on the sweet side than the savory. The orange mush that comes with it is a sausage based smear. So interesting. 
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes - this dish looks small but there's so much flavor and a lot of meat. Very dense. This was a bit too much for me but it was still tasty. The presentation was very cute. 
,,,,,"Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto & bread crumbs, Santorini Fava Puree & Charmoula - the BF loved this but I probably wouldn't order it again. It's an odd spiciness and the filling has crunch and squish to it. "
,,,,,Brown Butter Panna Cotta - yes. Just yes. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet but not too tangy either. The sorbet mixed with the pudding-like delight is a great way to end the meal. 
,,,,,"The drip coffee they have is also very good so if you'd like a drink with the sweet, definitely grab a cup. The server was sweet enough to bring a second cup when we were low. Must try in Chicago!!"
,,,,,"Whenever I have friends visiting me, I'll bring them to the Purple Pig. That's how much I love this place. I literally have tried everything on the menu. Yet I just keep coming back. "
,,,,,"The three items that I ordered this time are my top 3. Promise me you'll order them, or else you will miss out on the most beautiful flavors. "
,,,,,"We started with the bone marrow. This dish was simplicity at its best. You can just spread the marrow on the toasted bread like butter. The capers on the top perfectly balanced out the fatty and greasy marrow. All of these ingredients made a wonderful food melody. One bite, and I was in heaven. "
,,,,,"We were then served with the grilled octopus. As I've said multiple times -- I'm a huge octopus fan. This dish is for sure among the best octopus I've had. The octopus was grilled to form a crispy crust, while the inner part was still tender. The sauce also elevated the flavor, adding a touch of freshness to the dish. "
,,,,,"Last but certainly not least, we had the grilled broccoli. This dish could even make a hater love broccoli. It's that GOOD. I didn't even feel like I was eating vegetables. Can you believe that we finished off this dish first? Hahaha"
,,,,,"I don't want to be grumpy... but there are just too many people lol. Every time I go there, I have to wait for at least an hour. It's such a torture smelling the amazing food coming out of the kitchen."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Came here as a rec from a friend. It's a very hip restaurant with tapas that are sharing size. I tried the bone marrow, which was delicious and the cilantro went well with it. We also had the milk pork shoulder. That was good, but the pork was a little salty for me and I wish there was more mashed potatoes! Pig ears were good, can never go wrong with this as an appetizer. And lastly, my favorite dish was the ricotta gnocchi. The noodles and the cheese were the perfect texture together and the tomato sauce was made so well. We scraped the rest of it with bread."
,,,,,We had the octopus to start off because it was recommended by a few others at the table (community seating). The octopus was salty but still it was tender and tasted fresh. We also had some oysters- these oysters were fresher than what I've had at home in Oregon. I would definitely recommend them. 
,,,,,The wait was a bit long so I would anticipate at least an hour before you get seated. The day we went it was really humid and they only had about 2 fans running outside. The positive thing here is that they text you when your table is ready. So put your name on the list and walk the strip since it's so close!
,,,,,"Man alive, this restaurant just gets better and better (and it was pretty great to start with). Came a few years ago when I was last in Chicago, was blown away by the terrific dishes. New location but dare I say they've even stepped it up a notch beyond? The beet dish is divine - get it. The pistachio cream underneath is the most ingenious and spectacular foil for the sweet and sour beet and creamy feta. The pork shoulder was melt in your mouth tender and sooooooo flavorful. Properly seasoned juice pork is like a once in a lifetime experience and this one couldn't have been better. Delicious gnocchi, fabulous octopus, great cocktails, superb service EVEN WITH KIDS. There were dozens of dishes on the menu we would have been thrilled to try - it was so difficult narrowing down to a reasonable list and seriously, everything we tried was incredible. If only they would take reservations! I hate having to worry after a spot in line - just let people reserve!! Make em pay if they don't show up. "
,,,,,This is among the top restaurants we've visited anywhere. Purple Pig is an absolute must.
,,,,,"Won't lie, I always thought this was a burger place and just never walked in (not that there's anything wrong with burger places, I'm just generally not in the mood for burgers). What a delightful surprise when I found out this was one of the more popular downtown, small plate, locations that is notoriously hard to just walk-in to."
,,,,,Good news was that me and my plus one were immediately seated when I walked in. The place was already packed. The air smelled amazing with the food that had already been served. All good stuff.
,,,,,The server highlighted some menu items and then put in our appetizers requests while we considered the rest of the meal. The one problem was that the menu switched and our server didn't warn us about it. Generally the dinner service menu had more options and very few things were removed - but of course- one of the items I had wanted WAS one that was stopped for dinner service. Oh well.
,,,,,"The food ordered: polpo, duck, roast, meat and cheese board, and a couple of others; was truly fantastic. The duck was incredibly memorable as one of the most well done I've ever had."
,,,,,Good food. Good ambiance. What more could you ask for?
,,,,,"I got here around 6:00 on a weeknight with 3 coworkers and the place was packed!  Luckily we got a spot at a community table.  I'm not really a fan of that kind of seating, but it wasn't bad.  "
,,,,,"The food was amazing!  We got the beets, pork shoulder, pizza, calamari (not breaded), and a few other items I can't recall right now.  "
,,,,,"We also enjoyed our cocktails and the wine recommended by our server.  One of my friends said she wanted a fruity champagne cocktail and there was nothing on the menu like that, but the bartender made her something that she loved.  "
,,,,,"It does get really loud in there, so keep that in mind.  Also, my coworker went to the restroom and said it was pretty dirty.  "
,,,,,"Other than that, a very good experience."
,,,,,This was an amazing meal. I ate here alone on a business trip and the food and staff was exceptional. Great tapas and meats. I will definitely go back.
,,,,,"We got a cheese board with jam and crackers, ricotta gnocchi (they were able to make a tomato based vegetarian sauce from scratch), and potato smashed which is accompanied by an amazing yogurt dipping sauce.  It's a small place that does not take reservations. It has a fun vibe and great bites and drinks!"
,,,,,Another restaurant that came highly recommended that did not let me down. This was the first place we ran to after landing in Chicago. 
,,,,,"It's a tapas place that also has a wide variety of wines, cheeses and meats to choose from. We had a few different dishes. The choripan panini was chorizo with carmelized onions. We also got the beets. I've never eaten beets before, but when I saw that it came with whipped goat cheese, pistachios and nut butter, I had to try it. I have no plans to eat more beets in the future, but it was a pretty good, inventive dish. "
,,,,,"The dish that knocked me off my feet were the crispy pig ears. Another food I've never tried, but it came with a kale-type salad. I couldn't stop eating them. "
,,,,,"I'm not a fan of communal table seating, but other than that, this is a great place to get food."
,,,,,"One of my must stops every time I'm in Chicago. The octopus is a must. Not much more needs to be said that others haven't already. So I'll simply just point out that their staff and hospitality are unreal, especially when you factor in how ridiculously busy and packed they are."
,,,,,"Came during rush hour but the food still came super fast. Really good service and of course, delicious food! A highlight would be the turkey leg: super tender and juicy."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,I think I've done it.  I'm pretty sure I've found the best restaurant in Chicago.  The Purple Pig delivers on every demand a foodie could want.  It has been a few months since I've left a restaurant this happy.
,,,,,"This little tapas style restaurant is pretty much always on a wait.  If you want in, come on a weekday around 9pm+ in my opinion.  Secondly, you should know that the majority of their tables are community style, so be prepared to have people staring at your food...as you should be doing to them.  While normally I'm not into community style tables, it works here due to the tapas atmosphere.  The servers do not rush you, and do not make you commit to a certain amount of food off the bat.  As a matter of fact, our server told us to only order a few and look around after eating some, and then order more.  We did that with the family next to us.  We kept comparing dishes and talking about what we liked, and disliked."
,,,,,"Our server also did an amazing job explaining the menu and pacing out our meal since we had limited real estate on our table.  It seemed like things came....we ate them....and as the next item was dropped, the only plate was taken.  Like beautiful, delicious clockwork."
,,,,,"The 3 of us were recommended to get 6-7 items, so we each picked a few that everyone else agreed on and prepared ourselves.  "
,,,,,"Between food pace and quality, our server's attention and kindness, and the general awesome ambiance and atmosphere...this place was firing on all cylinders for us.  I cannot wait to come back here again."
,,,,,Below you will find the dishes we ordered if you care to know more about each dish.
,,,,,We ordered and received the following:
,,,,,"Bone Marrow - A large bone full of marrow served with buttered Texas toast, cilantro, capers and sea salt.  This was pretty amazing, but to be honest...once you've had good bone marrow, you've had it all.  In my bone marrow indulgences, I've had good, and bad...but never amazing."
,,,,,"Pork Belly - This is the second dish we received and was tied for the most impressive flavor wise.  The complaint I have here is the portion size.  While I know this is a tapas restaurant, it still seemed tiny in comparison to everything else we received.  I feel doubling the size of this dish would give it more value.  I still highly recommend ordering this however because the flavor was spectacular."
,,,,,"Hummus Shakshouka - OK....this dish was a dud.  The menu described it beautifully and I thought we would actually get Shakshouka but it was pretty much de-constructed which is not how the menu described it.  We got an egg, some sauce and hummus.  Honestly, this dish was beyond not worth it and I'm surprised it is on the menu.  Do NOT waste your time/money on this."
,,,,,"Burrata - This dish unfortunately also did not impress anyone.  Burrata is a soft mozzarella like cheese that is mixed with cream.  The presentation was BEAUTIFUL as they made it look like Cannoli but unfortunately it was bland and unimpressive. Two misses in a row, we were a little worried."
,,,,,"Fried Chicken Marsala - Another phenomenal dish that sounds mediocre on paper, but is executed perfectly.  I'm not even sure how they accomplished the flavors honestly, but it was a perfectly fried piece of chicken, with dabs of mushroom sauce, and actual mushrooms.  It was seasoned to perfection and was my 2nd favorite item this night."
,,,,,"Lamb Ribs - The family next to us, could not stop raving about this.  It did indeed look delicious so we ordered it.  WOW...thank you family that I don't know.  This was the correct choice and tied with the pork belly for most flavorful of the night.  This dish is a MUST when you come here."
,,,,,"Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - When this came out, we were in pain from all the food jammed into our bellies.  I don't think we gave this dish a fair shot in all honesty because everyone was so full.  The little bit I tried was very good, but I had to put the fork down...same goes for my two dinner companions."
,,,,,"This is my first time in Chicago, and this was the first restaurant that my husband and I ate at. I absolutely loved it! To be honest, I'm not sure if I have eaten better food elsewhere, and I'm from California."
,,,,,"First off, the atmosphere is great. It was crowded with people, all the servers were super friendly and sweet, we could see the bar and the kitchen from where we sat, and the decor was pretty cool as well."
,,,,,"Secondly, I love the whole idea behind the restaurant. Here you have amazing Mediterranean dishes that are served tapas style. I thought that was great! "
,,,,,"My husband and I ordered several items to share between the two of us, and it was the perfect amount of food: Green Chickpea + Hummus, Deviled Egg, Housemade Gyros (under the Meat section), and Ricotta Gnocchi. "
,,,,,"For dessert, we had a Sicilian Iris, and I enjoyed a coffee drink called Carajillo. So yummy!!! "
,,,,,"If you are ever in the Chicago area, I highly recommend this place! I'm pretty sure you will not be disappointed. If my husband and I come back to Chicago, this place is a must on our list!"
,,,,,"We got to the restaurant around 5:30pm, there was a bit of a wait but luckily it wasn't too long."
,,,,,Foie gras ($24 USD)
,,,,,"This was served with a scoop of icecream which was interesting. Surprisingly, both went well together along with the strawberry jelly. Tasty, but felt a bit overpriced."
,,,,,Bone Marrow ($23 USD)
,,,,,"My most memorable item of the night. The bone marrow was SOO thick, I have never seen any piece of bone marrow that thick. I was speechless when I saw it. They recommend you adding the piece of bone marrow to your sliced baguette, add a pinch of salt and some cilantro on top. Super fatty dish I know, but it was just delicious."
,,,,,Octopus ($24 USD)
,,,,,"This was the only disappointing item for me. The octopus was cooked absolutely perfectly, which is actually really hard to do. The only that bothered me was the flavour of the sauce - was kind of a soury pesto, not sure what it is but I just didn't like the taste."
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder ($21 USD)
,,,,,This is like the staple dish for this restaurant! I was actually disappointed it came last as we pretty much stuffed our bellies eating all the other dishes. The meat is really tender and flavourful - if you focus hard enough you can taste a milky flavour braised in the meat. Absolutely love the mashed potatoes - definitely goes well with the sauce.
,,,,,"Not so sure about their cocktails here - We ordered a Moscow mule ($16 USD), which was overpriced and barely any alcohol in it."
,,,,,"Restaurant is a bit loud, but definitely recommend if you are in town."
,,,,,Nice spot to grab a nice dinner downtown if you don't want to head over to Randolph.
,,,,,Went there for a date night and loved it a lot; the bone marrow is not as special as some folks claim it to be though!
,,,,,"A friend of mine visited Chicago about 5 years ago and could not stop raving about The Purple Pig. When my husband and I decided to take a vacation to Chicago, I could not wait to eat there! It did not disappoint. I went in with the expectation that we would have a long wait to be seated, but we happened to go in the late afternoon and were seated within 5 minutes. The vibe is sort of a finished industrial feel. Tables are pretty close together, and the restaurant was somewhat loud. However, the seating created a friendly environment in my opinion, and we quickly began talking to the couple sitting next to us. It gave us an opportunity to see what they ordered and get their feedback. The wine and beer list is extensive and impressive. My husband had a sour beer brewed with grapes and I had a wheat ale made with beets, both of which were wonderful. We shared 3 dishes between the two of us (Fried pig ears, smoked pork tongue, and pork jowl). All three were beyond delicious and were plenty to fill us up. The pork jowl was our favorite! The couple next to us ordered dessert and we could not resist once we saw it. We also ordered the ""Sicilian Iris"", an incredibly perfect beignet type dessert with ricotta and chocolate chips inside and powdered sugar on top. To die for!!! The meal was a bit pricey (about $100), but not outrageous compared to other tapas restaurants, also considering we each had a beer, meal, and dessert and were completely stuffed."
,,,,,"Overall, the food was unique and delicious. The staff and atmosphere were wonderful. The prices were reasonable. I would recommend for anyone traveling to Chicago to eat at The Purple Pig. You will not regret it!"
,,,,,Wow. All I can say is Wow. Everything here we had was amazing. 
,,,,,Salmon - incredibly moist and flavorful. Larger than anticipated based on the price. 
,,,,,Salted Beets - huge portion and the best thing we had. The whipped goat cheese is so delicate and light yet incredibly flavorful. 
,,,,,"Broccoli - my least favorite, but still amazing. A rendition of cheesy broccoli"
,,,,,"Steak - unfortunately don't recall the name, but it was melt in your mouth good "
,,,,,A few notes:
,,,,,-don't take reservations. We were there at 5pm on a Monday and didn't have a problem. They were full at 6pm. 
,,,,,- communal tables 
,,,,,"- huge wine selection, 5 and 8 oz pours"
,,,,,- create their own soda water
,,,,,"This is my third time back to The Purple Pig, first time in a few years and at their newer location. While the essence of the restaurant remains, I was a bit bummed by the food and general experience. "
,,,,,THE GOOD
,,,,,"Amazed that we were seated quickly (although Sunday at 8:30pm) and the hostess and service was super responsive and upbeat. Great wine and beverages menu, always thrilled by how comprehensive it was (had a blackberry hard cider, my partner had a nice syrah). Small plate was great, an eggplant zaponata: simple and delicious. "
,,,,,THE NOT ALL THERE
,,,,,"Entrees were served cold, plating uninspired. Got a small strip steak ($25) which arrived cool to the touch on a bed of cold caramelized onions and bell peppers. The chicken kebabs ($17) were warm-ish, but served on a cold plate of roasted potatoes. Not sure if this was the intention but it negativity impacted the experience of the dishes. Music and conversation were super loud, tables were close so you had to scoot every time someone brushed by. Frequently saw staff cluster together in bottleneck areas to avoid bumping into each other as they passed, most squeezing in between customer tables. The vibe felt rushed and cramped. Overall, wasn't pleased with the experience for the price ($112 for two, 3 plates and 2 drinks)."
,,,,,Wasn't the experience I was hoping for. Would love to return to the past incredible experience I've had with TPP.
,,,,,"The Purple Pig  is a hidden Gem in Chicago!  I was definitely wowed by the ultimate explosion of flavors provided by this Tapas Restaurant.  I was in a party of 3 and we came for lunch on Saturday after 12:30, so we knew we would be waiting for a table. Hostess was very polite told us probably a 45 min wait and she took my mobile # down for text alert when our table is ready. Now this restaurant is set up with indoor and outdoor seating and we took the 1st available. You must know that this is set up with a mix of community style seating and regular tables but they are all very close together and if you are uncomfortable with that this may not be your gig. Our group had no problem with this. Since there were 3 of us we decided to order 4 plates to start with and decided later if we needed more to satisfy everyone. Now our waiter explained to us that the food will come out of the kitchen as it is ready so they are not going to hold food and bring all 4 plates at once. Perfectly fine with our group being that we have been to other Tapas restaurants that do the same. I am glad he explained that to us on the front end as well. So we ordered:"
,,,,,Bobota Greek Cornbread which had Feta and Mizithra Cheeses and Honey drizzled on the plate. Wow this Cornbread is to die for and this Southern boy Loved It!!  It is so moist and both cheeses balance out that sweetness from the cornbread and honey. 
,,,,,"Roasted Cauliflower with sliced pickles was delicious and refreshing. I am NOT a Cauliflower lover at all but I was convinced to try it and I found a new appreciation for it and enjoyed it. This Cauliflower preparation was different than any other I had before, thin sliced with small thinly sliced pickles all roasted together. Very enjoyable my hats off to the Chef!!"
,,,,,Roasted Bone Marrow was amazing!!  The Chef has this preparation down to a science!  Using the toasted bread and layering the roasted Bone Marrow and sprinkle on the Sicilian Sea Salt and then place the Herb Salad on top and eat. Wow just Amazing!!! Great Chef!!
,,,,,Housemade Meatballs with green garlic and ricotta was the highlight and just awesome!!  These flavor packed and tender meatballs are delicious and topped off a power packed flavor symphony!!!
,,,,,I want to thank The Purple Pig for the Chef's Culinary Creativity and Amazing display of Plating!!!  Wow you are on my Top 5 Restaurants in Chicago!!
,,,,,Thanks!!!!
,,,,,"Be prepared to get cozy with your newfound friends (the complete strangers joining you at communal tables) because this place is popular and relatively small, so they pack folks in. We wandered in midday on a Sunday, and it was busy but there was no wait whatsoever. I guess we got lucky to get no reservation and no wait time. Service was incredibly friendly and prompt. All of the menu items are quite large, so go with a group and eat family style so you can sample more items because everything is great and there are a lot of options. This is a meat-lover's dream. Also, they carry Malort, so order a shot."
,,,,,"You know you're starting to get old when you're looking for ""late night eats"" at 12:30 AM after watching a movie instead of 4 AM after a night at the bars. On the bright side though, there are a lot more options instead of just the usual greezy joints. "
,,,,,"After doing a quick Yelp search, it looked like Purple Pig was closing in 33 minutes. We figured they wouldn't be seating people anymore, but F it, it was worth a shot. To our surprise, we walked right in and got a table. Quite a difference from the 2 hour wait we're used to seeing here. "
,,,,,"Food: The service was a bit rushed, but understandably so since they were literally closing in 25 minutes haha. My goal was to not order anything that we already ordered the last time we were here, which was difficult since we damn near ordered the entire menu last time. Under pressure, we just shot from the hip and ordered some random items, which turned out to be great."
,,,,,"Duck neck rillette - Last time we were here we ordered the turkey rillette, which was one of our favorite items. I'd say the duck rillette turned out to be just as good. I still don't know what the hell a rillette is, but picture a meat spread which a texture halfway between pate and shredded meat. It was salty and very dense, just delicious. When you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer. Throw a little strawberry mostarda on there too to add a little jam-like sweetness. I'm getting whatever neck rillette they have on the menu from now on. "
,,,,,"Smoked tongue - We were frantically looking through the menu to find something else to get, and our waiter suggested we try the tongue. Good call. The smoked tongue was delicious and a must try if you're a fan of salty meats. It reminded me of an Italian deli meat with a smokey twist. Each bite almost tasted like a cross between pepperoni and bacon. 2 for 2 so far with the dishes."
,,,,,"Pork blade steak - When they brought this dish out, we were surprised at how big it was. This is probably the best value item on the menu. It looked like a super juicy pork chop served with a caesar style arugula salad. The steak was as good as it gets, hands down my favorite dish of the night. It was super juicy and tender, and something about the flavor just reminded me of breakfast. It had a distinct pepper taste, and almost tasted like breakfast sausage in steak form. Highly recommend this."
,,,,,Lamb ribs - This was the least favorite of the dishes. Maybe I just prefer pork over lamb. The texture was definitely there. The meat was falling off the bone and had a nice layer of fattiness. The sauce was just a little too sweet and overpowering for me. It was like a really bold barbecue sauce slathered all over the ribs. 
,,,,,"Overall, this was as gourmet as you can get for some late night grub. I'm glad we impulsively ordered without reading any descriptions because we discovered a couple gems on the menu."
,,,,,"For years my friends and I have contemplated going to the Purple Pig for dinner but were always discouraged by whole no reservations thing. This past Saturday was finally the day we were gonna execute our master plan: get to the city early enough, put our name down, then drink at a bar until we're pleasantly surprised with the call. It was Saturday dinner and we were prepared to wait 2-3 hours. By some crazy stroke of luck, we got the call after just 30 min. "
,,,,,Ambiance: This place seemed to be foodie central. You would see random flashes of light from different parts of the room as people would be taking pictures of each dish that came out. Inside the restaurant it was super packed. We sat at one of the communal tables near the front and were pretty shoulder to shoulder with the parties next to us.   
,,,,,"Food: The menu was tapas style and they suggested about 2 plates per person. Since we had a group of 5, we were able to order a ton of dishes and get a little taste of each."
,,,,,"Pig ears w/ crispy kale - This dish was pretty simple: kale mixed with little strips of fried pig ears, topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg. The pig ears were super crunchy and the texture sort've reminded me of crispy onion strings. This one was just average for me though. All the individual components tasted good, but I didn't think they really married together to create something special."
,,,,,"Turkey neck rillette smear - We honestly only ordered this because one of our friends only eats poultry and this was one of the few options he had...but DAMN this was surprisingly one of my favorite plates of the night. The texture was somewhere between pulled pork and pate spread, and the flavor was salty but still with a turkey taste. It also came with thick slices of fluffy bread and some sort of cranberry jam.   "
,,,,,"Wagyu sirloin - The meat was super tender and juicy and was a perfectly cooked medium rare. The beans kind of seemed out place with the steak and I would've preferred maybe a potato side instead. Not the most unique dish, but still very delicious."
,,,,,"Pork belly rillons - According to our server this was one of the more popular items. It was basically a plate of only 5 cubes of fatty pork covered in this thick, sweet glaze. They had a slightly crisp outside with a super fatty center that just melted in your mouth. The glaze kind of gave it that candied bacon vibe. I loved this dish, but I wish it wasn't so small. I needed more!"
,,,,,Chicken thigh kebabs - These were skewers of juicy pieces of chicken served over a mix of fried potatoes and some creamy tzatziki sauce. The best part was they left the skin on the chicken so it had a nice crispy outside. 
,,,,,"Roasted bone marrow - Barely a year ago I was a bone marrow rookie who's never tasted it before. Now it's pretty tough to pass it up when I see it on the menu. This was seriously a deep ass bone, and the marrow was everything I expected: slimy, rich, and flavorful. The salad it came with was a nice little touch. "
,,,,,"JLT - It was basically an open faced BLT sandwich with layers of pork jowl, tomato, and frisee, topped with a fried egg. The meat was insanely tender for how lean it was. The frisee was dressed with a great pesto aioli that gave it a caesar salad type taste. Overall a very solid dish.  "
,,,,,"Milk braised pork shoulder - At first glance it just looked like mound of comfort food: pork with mashed potatoes and gravy. This takes the prize for most tender meat consumed all night. All you had to do was lift the meat in the air, and gravity itself would break it up into pieces for you. "
,,,,,"Pork neck bone gravy - This honestly just tasted like regular marinara sauce mixed with some cheese. I actually combined this with some of the milk braised pork shoulder. As a standalone dish I thought it was pretty weak, but it turned out to be a great condiment to complement other dishes. "
,,,,,"Milk fed suckling pork belly - To me this dish felt like 3 different meats in one. You had super fatty pieces of pork belly, then an in between texture that looked like a piece of neck or something, then finally a more lean cut of meat. It was covered in a peppery, creamy sauce that reminded me of country gravy. "
,,,,,"Pork ossobuco - This was a massive veal shank. It was so tender that you can literally just pull the bones out clean. The polenta was nice and creamy, but the meat to polenta ratio was way off. I could've used a ton more polenta to pair with each bite of meat. Great dish for big eaters that want a ton of meat."
,,,,,Dessert:
,,,,,"Sicilian Iris - It's a huge fried ball of dough filled with chocolate and creamy cheese. Don't question it, just get it."
,,,,,Hazelnut Verrine - It was like a parfait with different layers of cream and chocolate. The bottom layer is a thick custard that had a great espresso flavor.
,,,,,"Overall, Purple Pig lived up to the hype in my head, and it was an awesome dinner experience. I ate pork in way more varieties than I could have ever thought of within a single meal. I would definitely come back."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,We had the braised pork shoulder and the Spanish octopus; both were amazing.  I'm so glad I checked Yelp for dining reviews.
,,,,,Our server was knowledgeable and friendly.
,,,,,"The only thing I would do differently is order one vegetable side instead of two.  The portions were larger than ""small"" plates.  That's only a challenge when you're staying in a hotel without a refrigerator.  "
,,,,,We will definitely return the next time we're in Chicago!
,,,,,"Food was good with a few dishes that were way saltier than the others. I recommend the Spanish octopus, scallops and razor clams and the foie gras. I was pretty disappointed with the grilled broccoli, bone marrow, and pork jowl. "
,,,,,"However, the service left me with an awful taste in my mouth. This is not specific towards one employee but rather a few of them on multiple occasions. I cannot say if this is because my party and I were Asian but we did not feel like the service was on par with other diners at the restaurant. "
,,,,,My friends and I noticed the waiters offered to switch other patrons plates and utensils but did not offer my table. I had to request for a change of plates but not a big deal. Can easily be overlooked. 
,,,,,"Waiter #1 put down one of our dishes and waiter #2 put down our second dish. However before waiter #2 walked away, he questioned us if we ordered our first dish more than once. When we confirmed that we did order the dish (or else why would waiter#1 know to drop it off at our table?) he asked us if we were sure in the most condescending tone. We felt like he thought we were not being truthful and trying to just take the dish or something. It was extremely rude and offensive. Should he have questioned us if he didn't even know what we ordered in the first place? He even went to our waiter who took down our order to confirm if we ordered our dish. I felt extremely singled out because of this."
,,,,,Everything else was good so happy dining :)
,,,,,"My most favorite Chicago spot. Once, we flew to Chicago just to eat HERE! The food is amazing, fresh and interesting. The staff are engaging. Their new location is socially distanced, clean, and bright. Come prepared to spend a lot to get delicious food and social interaction."
,,,,,"After many recommendations - both Yelp and from friends, my wife & I visited last night. Thankfully, despite the warnings, we walked in and were seated immediately.  We sat inside at a cozy marble topped table for two. They also have an outside area, that's covered and heated - and is much quieter than inside. There was music pumping so conversation was tough - between the music, people speaking loudly to get over the music, and the occasional staff yelling to announce food is ready!  "
,,,,,Service was great - polite and on top of things - both our waiter and the servers that rushed the food to your table when it was ready.  
,,,,,"The cocktails were on the small side, but were also on point...unique, flavorful and not too weak."
,,,,,"We ordered the almonds, pig ears and cannoli - all were delicious. Our least favorite was the ""tater tots"" - we were not a fan of the sofrito.  The carrots & plantain dish was delish and was our favorite.  We stopped there, in an effort to preserve our waistline and pocketbook. However, there's a distinct possiblity we are returning tonight to get the Brussels sprouts, pork shoulder and fried cheese :) "
,,,,,My only real complaint was the noise...if only they'd turn down the music a couple of notches.
,,,,,Burrata cannoli - Yes! I wish it was a tad bit bigger in portion size for the cost and a little more burrata taste ... it was overwhelmed by the garnishes and the crispy outer layer. But I would get it again.
,,,,,"Bone marrow - Meh. I've had better, it was really oily and one marrow accompanied by 4 big pieces of bread. Should've been two marrows... maybe California restaurants are more generous?"
,,,,,"Gnocchi - Pretty good. Firm on the outside, doughy on the inside. Well made but I don't think it was housemade."
,,,,,"Milk braised beef - Must get. Tender, well seasoned, unique."
,,,,,I'd recommend this place for Chicago visitors but I'd also caution them to be sure to pick the right items. This place used to have a Michelin star but I can see why they no longer have it: the dishes need more effort and thought into them.
,,,,,"Holy geez. This place is great and I sure am glad my sister found it. After going to a museum and before going to see Hamilton, my sister and I stopped here for lunch. It was hella busy but we were seated and  had a menu quickly. The tables and isles are very close together but not uncomfortably so. "
,,,,,"The menu had plenty of chocies but we decided on 4 things, the Bobota (greek cornbread, brussels sprouts, hummus, and a chorizo panini. Everything came out super fast and was amazingly delicious, I don't think I could pick a favortie so obviously get them all."
,,,,,PLEASE COME TO NY!! 
,,,,,I came in sometime in Fall2018. I still have dreams of this place and have to stop myself from spontaneously flying to Chicago just for The Purple Pig.
,,,,,Thankfully I was alone and was open to sitting at the counter because I was sat as soon as I walked in. They were packed (it was either a Friday or Saturday night) the wait would have been at least 45minutes for a table.
,,,,,"The Sweet Corn Polenta was delicious. It was pretty sweet, creamy, and the tartness of the passionfruit made the dish sing! The Milk Braised Pork was so tender and juicy it fell apart the second I put it in my mouth. It was all so creative and delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the cocktail but don't let that deter you, it was made well I just was being adventurous and picked the wrong cocktail for my taste."
,,,,,Tip: It's a little loud because the kitchen is right behind the counter so you can hear and see everything going on but it entertained me and I enjoyed the hustle and bustle.
,,,,,"I came here for a lunch meeting at work - it's a swanky spot on Michigan Ave. I was with a party of 5, and the service was excellent and fast!"
,,,,,"OMG! This place is absolutely divine! The ambiance, the staff and the food! It's pricey but worth it! We had a couple of bottles of vino... excellent! Very nice bouquet and smooth finish. The food was amazing and perfectly prepared. Beautiful presentations... definitely recommend!"
,,,,,"Was the guest for a business lunch here the second week of July. Two of the dishes (the ravioli and the broccoli) were literally inedible. It tasted as if gasoline had been poured over them. Not only that, the broccoli was smothered in about a cup of mayonnaise, then had the gasoline poured on it.  This is a tapas-themed restaurants, which is probably not wise during a pandemic, but they make it worse by not providing enough serving spoons, which is insane. We kept asking for serving spoons, and would get one teaspoon. So there we were, three unrelated people, trying desperately not to share germs; it was just impossible. On top of that, the restaurant was extremely crowded and poorly ventilated. The windows and doors were all closed. No servers were wearing masks and the restaurant is so noisy they were six inches away from my face while speaking. Yes, I am fully vaccinated, but that is only 85% effective against Delta. The place is a public health disaster waiting to happen. As for the food, well, the tuna tartare was great, the rice balls acceptable, but all I keep thinking about is how horrible the other two dishes were."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Snagged a seat at the bar as a walk-in. Purple Pig is crowded for good reason! Tapas style so probably around 6-8 dishes for 4 people gets you satisfied. Razor clams and crispy chicken Skin were my personal favorites. Drinks are well made and strong. Would come back but definitely make a reservation beforehand.
,,,,,It was okay.
,,,,,"There was a lot of hype coming to this place, but frankly I think I may have built it up, and it just didn't live up to my anticipated expectations."
,,,,,"No reservations, first come-first serve only. The place is cramped, high demand and long wait time. Nice that the implement text-to-notify that gives you a 10 minute window to come back. "
,,,,,"Not a formal-style of serving, they bring the food out as it's ready. Everything is meant to be shared and the portions are small."
,,,,,"We got pork shoulder, Brussels sprouts, salmon and bone marrow. Pork shoulder was really good, amazing texture and flavor. Grilled sprouts were tasty, feel like you're eating light chips flavors like Brussels sprouts. Salmon was really well cooked and prepared, bone marrow was underwhelming. "
,,,,,"Good experience, very Yuppie place and decent food. Great for date night, just not with a big group."
,,,,,"I know there are a lot of mixed reviews for The Purple Pig, but definitely, it was easily the one of the best, if not the best meal, the BF and I had during out short Labor Day Trip to Chicago. We're so glad that we made the decision to hit up this spot approx 20mins before they opened on a tuesday right before our flight back home."
,,,,,"Of note, although we were the first party to arrive that random tuesday at like 10:30am? 11am? By the time that the restaurant opened its table, there was a nice little line formed behind us. As yall know, they do not take reservations, so your best option is to go during their off hours."
,,,,,"We were so excited that we probably ordered way too much food. All items are meant to be shared, tapas style. We went with the following:"
,,,,,-Crispy Pig Ears - Perfect appetizer to start off the meal. Little bits of cripsy fried goodness that will make you want more and more each bite. Did I mention how amazing the kale was in this? If only my Kale at home turns out this good each time I try to make kale. Must order if you're into getting an alternative to fries. 
,,,,,-Grilled octopus - Probably my favorite dish of the meal. The Octopus was soooo soo tender and flavorful. It was perfectly rilled and the flavors all mixed very well with the accompanying ingredients. Anytime they're able to get octopus so tender and flavorful is a win win in my book. 
,,,,,"-Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder - The infamous pork shoulder have a lot of hits amongst the reviews and a lot of misses. On this occasion, it was defintel a hit. Braised well and so tender, this would have been the perfect protein to eat with just a nice service of white rice. You can taste the love in the shoulder and the time spent ensuring the texture is just right. Some reviews state this was a tad bit too salty, for us it was just right. Come to say, we had leftovers of this dish and the BF and I ate it cold in the airport a few hours later and it tasted even better. The perfect roast. "
,,,,,-Grilled Broccoli - You can go really wrong with veggies--especially for certain restaurants to focus on meat. Not here. This was delicious and stood really well amongst the heavy protein in our meal. The garlic sauce in this was something else causing the BF to inquire if there is anyway i can recreate the dish at home.
,,,,,"Overall, the meal was lovely. Prices were reasonable and portions, actually quite hefty. I wished I lived in the city--if i did, I would come back all the time. Unfortunately, I'm 5 hours away by plane. If you're traveling and making a stop in Chicago, you definitely need to give this place a try."
,,,,,"I was staying across the street and decided to pop in for dinner with a few coworkers, not realizing how popular this place is. We were able to get seated in the back, at a bar-top overlooking the kitchen/prep area, which ended up being pretty cool because we got to see just about everything on the menu. The bone marrow is a pretty popular choice here, however we opted for the pork belly, ""pizza"" and ribs. Everything was great, despite service being a little slow. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,The short: 
,,,,,"This place is built for carnivores, but I ventured over for some beets, eggplant, and ice cream that didn't disappoint. Vegetarians it's worth a try - just order a bunch of sides. "
,,,,,The long: 
,,,,,"The Hype: This place is hyped. It is literally one of the first places mentioned everytime I ask for a place to eat in Chicago. It was crowded at 10pm on a Wednesday night, but I got a spot at the very corner of the bar. "
,,,,,The Looks: I Instagram-ed the entrance because it looks straight out of an old time movie about Chicago - especially at 10pm on a rainy day. It's right on Michigan Avenue so the whole street is beautiful. The food looks amazing too.
,,,,,"The Taste: The bartender/my waiter told me I could basically get the whole left side of the menu (not 100% true) which is tapas. I was going to order 3, but he cautioned me so I got 2: the beets and the eggplant. "
,,,,,Beets - Wow I took 1 bite of the beets with the pistachio yogurt and my brain started tingling (not sure how else to describe it...). Definitely an almost overwhelming amount of favor. 
,,,,,"Eggplant - The eggplant was less intense, but still packed with flavor and served over grilled pita bread with black garlic purée. A good filing vegetarian dish. "
,,,,,Olive Oil Gelato - Probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Cooled down my stomach after all of the intense flavors. 
,,,,,Glad I came - it was worth the hype! 
,,,,,--------------------------------------------------
,,,,,Request for business -  mark things off with a little (V) for vegetarian on the menu? It's make life a lot easier for customers and your waiters.
,,,,,"Our experience at The Purple Pig was a Yelp 3-star ""A-OK."" The food was OK (presentation was great) and the service and ambiance were good."
,,,,,"I chose The Purple Pig for our group (of five) for lunch because it popped up on Yelp as one of the highest-rated and most-reviewed restaurants on The Magnificent Mile. We were already on the Mag Mile, so I wanted to choose a place that was within walking distance. The Purple Pig is located near the south end of the Mag Mile, a few blocks north of the river."
,,,,,"This is a modern, happening tapas (small plates) restaurant with a bar, covered patio, and open kitchen. The restaurant isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. It's popular - at the time of writing this review, it's already got 4,581 reviews (!) - and it was packed during our Sunday afternoon visit around 1pm. They *do not* take reservations. It's first come, first served. We were lucky and were seated immediately at one of the communal high-tops near the kitchen."
,,,,,"As with any tapas restaurant, the dishes here are best shared. I asked our server, Andi, to give us her recommendations and she starred all the popular and most suggested items on the menu. This list should give you a good idea of the restaurant's offerings as well as pricing:"
,,,,,Antipasti:
,,,,,"* Broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette ($8)"
,,,,,"* Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers, & pistachios ($10)"
,,,,,"* Charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons, and parsley ($9)"
,,,,,* Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette ($9)
,,,,,Smears:
,,,,,* Roasted bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt ($14)
,,,,,Fried Items:
,,,,,"* Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg ($10)"
,,,,,"A La Plancha, Etc."
,,,,,"* Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde ($16)"
,,,,,"* Turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, napa cabbage, and agrodolce ($17)"
,,,,,* Pork blade steak with 'nduja and honey ($17)
,,,,,"* Squid stuffed with prosciutto and breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and charmoula ($15)"
,,,,,* Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13)
,,,,,"From the above recommendations, we ended up going with the broccoli, calamari, pig's ear, and octopus. In addition, we also ordered:"
,,,,,* Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki ($14)
,,,,,"In general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I can't say I had a favorite. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and flavorful enough (for the most part)."
,,,,,The anchovy vinaigrette made the broccoli a bit salty.
,,,,,"The calamari wasn't as my friends expected (fried calamari). Instead, the calamari was more like a cold pasta dish with lots of fregola (small pasta balls, similar to couscous) and thin, tart, vinegary radish and cucumber slices. Out of the dishes we ordered, we left the most of this one behind."
,,,,,The strips of pig's ear were hard and crispy (kind of like chips). I think our table was in agreement that the ear strips were kinda bland. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.
,,,,,"There really wasn't enough octopus to go around in the octopus dish. What little there was was good, however. Thick and flavorful."
,,,,,"If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be the chicken thigh kebabs. The tender chicken and filling potatoes were simple, tasty, and comforting."
,,,,,"Andi did an excellent job taking care of us. Dishes came out from the kitchen as they were ready, instead of all out at once (Andi asked us what we preferred and we chose the former). A Purple Pig branded glass bottle of water was left at our table so we didn't need to wait for refills on water. All of the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly."
,,,,,There are only two single-stall restrooms and there was always a line for the restrooms throughout the entire duration of our visit.
,,,,,"Good, expensive, unique, surprising.  "
,,,,,"All for the dishes were great.  They are served as soon as they come out of the kitchen, so the pace can be erratic. "
,,,,,The cost for two people for lunch without alcohol was $135.  
,,,,,It was interesting to see offal and pigs ears on the menu.  
,,,,,"We were ""adventurous"" and had Crispy Pig's Ear and Smoke Pork Tongue.  These were super tasty and would never know the source if you had not been told.  "
,,,,,"What did I learn?  The patio seating is nice, but it can be cold and breezy out there."
,,,,,"Nice vibe. Quite noisy. Good cocktails. Playlist was bad 70's pop rock. Interesting menu,  however not all items were well executed. Roasted bone marrow was good. Nice to see this dish on the menu. The accompanying bread left much to be desired . This dish is fat, parsley, capers, salt and bread. The bread is an important component of the dish. They need to do better. Crispy fried pig's ears were overly salty, as were several other dishes. Sadly, the night we were there, the lamb shanks were a disaster. Seriously off. The dish was served with lovely spring vegetables - a beautiful presentation, however the baby carrots carried the unmaskable taste of being cooked with something that was burned, and then overly salted. My first thought was that the roasting pan caught fire and that the kitchen had used salt to put it out. That bad. The half duck was okay. The garnish of Greek yogurt with salmon roe sadly did not work with the fish. I cannot imagine what they were thinking. Even Yotam Ottolenghi would cringe. Really wanted to like this place. Innovative plates, but in the end, they appear unable to carry them off. With so many excellent restaurants in Chicago I was surprised that they were so busy on a week night. Maybe we  caught them on an off night?"
,,,,,"The wait was worth it!!! Out here in the Windy City for a work event, and came here to grab dinner. Everything was delicious, waiter was very attentive. We got the octopus, peas, broccoli, braised pork shoulder and secreto. Everything was very delicious! Flavors were very balanced. Nothing over powering another flavor. The portions are meant for family style, sharing. 5 dishes, 3 people. But be prepared to wait. So, grab a drink, wait, and enjoy!"
,,,,,Stopped here on a Sunday around 1:30 PM and my husband and I were seated right away.
,,,,,"We ordered four plates to share between the two of us and it seemed to be just the right amount. Granted, we weren't starving when we arrived."
,,,,,"We started with the roasted Brussels sprouts which were great. Moved on to the bone marrow which we had never had before. I enjoyed it more than my husband but was glad the greens were supplied, as it balanced out some of the greasiness. "
,,,,,"My husband loves lamb so we went for the lamb ribs next. The flavors were great, but there was too much BBQ sauce on the ribs and it overpowered the taste of the lamb. I literally took most of the sauce off."
,,,,,"Finished with the pork shoulder, which was my husband's favorite. Tender and full of flavor! "
,,,,,Service was attentive and we always enjoy eating tapas so we can both try new items.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Drinks are still great. It's in a new location which isn't as cute & quant but has much more room. The whipped feta & ham croquettes were delicious. The entrees didn't appeal to ya this night so we stuck with apps and a meat/cheese board. Great service too!
,,,,,My friend & I happened to spot this place while walking down Michigan Ave & we were so glad we did! Love this place!! Not only did they have our favorite wine but we also enjoyed a fantastic appetizer...fried cheese! Delicious!
,,,,,OMG! Where do I begin? 
,,,,,Decor/ambiance: 5
,,,,,Service: 5 
,,,,,Food/drinks: 10
,,,,,Stop reading and just GO because you will not regret whatever you order! It's that amazballz! 
,,,,,Happy eating!
,,,,,"Definitely worth every penny! Came here with another foodie friend couple of ours and ordered practically everything (and every drink) on the menu! The Aragon Sour and the Pisco Stu were my favorites...ruch classics with a twist. You've gotta get a charcuterie and cheese board here, as the selection is amazing. The wine list was INSANE...you need to make sure like, 50% of your budget is allocated towards drinks. Ricotta gnocchi and smoked pork tongue were to die for. We gorged ourselves and luckily still had room for dessert and it didn't disappoint."
,,,,,"Everything I ate at the Purple Pig was delicious. I am gluten free (minor cross contamination doesn't impact me). I shared charcuterie of coppa, prosciutto and a smoky goat milk cheese. Troy, our server, explained the menu to me marking everything that was gluten free and made sure the crackers were on a separate plate. We also split salt roasted beets and milk braised pork shoulder (with gravy and farro on the side). Troy was very knowledgeable about gluten free dining and gave no indication my food needs were an inconvenience. "
,,,,,The menu changes frequently and there should be gluten free options on each but it is worth a phone call if you are dining with others who may not be GF. 
,,,,,"We walked in at 3:45pm on a Saturday hoping not to wait very long. The host took our name and number, indicated we would wait 20-30 minutes. It was very hot and humid just outside of the restaurant so we walked a short distance to Starbucks. By the time we ordered coffee and before our order was called, a text came in saying our table was ready. #GoodProblemToHave"
,,,,,I never updated after an initial bad experience years ago. 
,,,,,"This place is excellent restaurant. Knowledgeable staff, professional hosts, excellent food. The place can be super busy at all times of the day, so call ahead or chill outside with a glass of wine. "
,,,,,"I moved from Chicago years ago, but whenever somebody asks for solid restaurants in Chicago, this is always one of my go-to's."
,,,,,"My lady and I have been wanting to go into this place for a while, so when my birthday rolled around, she took me in for lunch before we went on my annual birthday bender and cubs game. "
,,,,,"Showed up around 115, and we're promptly sat outside. Took a few minutes for the waiter to showed up, but it was sort of busy so we weren't too concerned. When he came over, he didn't introduce himself, just asked what we wanted, and when we told him we hadn't been there before he just said okay and walked off. If this guy would've put in ANY effort, he could've pushed our tab up another 30-40 bucks. Any way, this apparently is a hip place to get lunch, so bad service was to be expected."
,,,,,"So we stared at this menu for a good 15 minutes before our beers showed up, which was pretty good and considering it was spanish paired pretty well with all the pork this place dishes out. We ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, which tasted like deep fried cocktail olives"
,,,,,"(which they were, our fault,) the neckbone gravy which was really good, the milk braised pork shoulder which was awesome, and the serrano ham on grilled bread and a duck egg which was the ultimate disappointment. I have never eaten such a salty dish in my life. And it wasn't the ham, it was the seemingly fistful of rocksalt sprinkled over the egg. I couldn't eat it and my girlfriend, who's kind of picky and took forever for me to convince to try a duck egg beforehand, looked at me like I was crazy."
,,,,,"When I mentioned it to my server, asking why it was so salty, he told me the ham is supposed to be salty. I asked him if the ham is salty, why all the salt on top, he just looked at me. I told him he could take it away and to please bring the check. Believe it or not, the check came almost instantaneously, fastest I'd seen him move all day. So disappointed."
,,,,,"Excellent! Great service, food was amazing!"
,,,,,"I had the pate, gnocchi and drinks!  We were 4 and everybody loved the appetizers and their food!"
,,,,,Open till late night. 
,,,,,It is a great place to get a drink.  A lot of choices here.  Big tables are available for group happy hours.
,,,,,Small plates of food are available.  They are carefully paired up with drinks.  I like the almond tart a lot.  Taste is great but portion is big.  The caramelized almonds are so irresistible that I finished the entire tart.
,,,,,"Some bar tenders are attentive and some can do a better job.  Generally speaking, receptionists are caring.  They even showed me the exit that I could stay indoor more time than outdoor while walking in a cold and wet winter night."
,,,,,"Hands down the best meal I had in Chicago. The chicken thigh kebabs are absolutely killer. So is the braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. You seriously can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and if you are feeling adventurous, the wait staff is wonderful at making recommendations. It's always packed, so either go early, or make sure you have time to wait for a table. It is most definitely worth the wait. A must-go in Chicago in my option."
,,,,,I'm still dreaming about the food we had last week when we came in for lunch! We were walking along Michigan Avenue and came across The Purple Pig and decided to give it a try after seeing the thousands of wonderful reviews. The places opens at 11:30am and by 11:45am the place was filled so plan accordingly. We opted to sit at the bar to avoid the wait and it was equally as great. The hot dog with foie gras butter was out of this world. I mean what could be bad with foie gras?! The calamari was very light as it's not fried and quite refreshing. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
,,,,,Expect to spend some money here. 
,,,,,Lots of small plates that are meant for sharing.
,,,,,Some plates only come with 3 or 4 bites. 
,,,,,Lotsss of wines to choose from. You can get a full or half bottle and of course smaller amounts. 
,,,,,Got the bone marrow spread twice. 
,,,,,Octopus was my favorite. 
,,,,,"We got the pork tongue, pork belly, lamp ribs, chicken kabob, and the fried shrimp."
,,,,,"Very crowded and busy. If you dont like waiting, go during off hour!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Purple pig has an amazing ambiance, i heard they moved and space is 2x bigger than before, friendly staff and hospitality, i sat at the bar since it was just me and ordered the milk pork shoulder which was so tender and creamy, with a potato purée it was superb, i order the Spanish octopus and much to my surprise it was really sour due to the preparation of the food, I'm not for sure what they cooked it in but it was to sour for me to continue to eat, i was so disappointed especially since i was gonna order the squid and the waiter highly recommended that dish i couldn't even take a picture because i immediately sent it back, i replaced that with the pork belly which was so much better also came with pork tenderloin. Overall it's a very tasty restaurant and will come back to try more dishes"
,,,,,Wait: 45 minutes on a Sunday for 4 
,,,,,Bobota Greek Cornbread ($7) - honestly was not worth the $7 and all four of us didn't really find it any special from any other cornbread
,,,,,Grilled Broccoli ($10) - ten bucks is definitely a steep for a bowl of brocolli but it was pretty good
,,,,,Caesar ($10) - probably one of the best caesar salads I have had. I loved the quail egg topping for this salad! 
,,,,,Calamari ($11) - This was pretty good. Tasted really refreshing and summery! 
,,,,,"Grilled Octopus ($19) - I was super excited about this order, but it was such a small order. There were maybe like 6 or 7 pieces of octopus which sucked for the price we were paying. "
,,,,,Roasted Bone Marrow ($16) - Bone Marrow with bread. Nothing too crazy but you should order it if you're interested in trying it or like bone barrow! 
,,,,,Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($16)- this was eh 
,,,,,Turkey Leg Confit ($19) - this is nothing like the turkey leg you get at theme parks. The turkey meat came right off the bone and was super good ! I was really full at this point but I still tried to get a few more bites of this before I finally gave up. 
,,,,,Drinks - the alcoholic drinks are a must!
,,,,,They had a lot of options!
,,,,,"I had the pork shoulder, recommended by other people at the bar. It was very rich and very good. "
,,,,,"I also had the deviled egg, which was sort of like a Scotch egg - but the inside was a creamy sauce, and the breading didn't have sausage. It was also very good."
,,,,,Second time here got the cheese plate and house platter meats. The house meat platter had about everything they offered. We liked some and didn't like others - but the range of quality and flavor was excellent. The garnishes and house made crackers they served with this were delicious. 
,,,,,"The cheese plate was also excellent. We only picked 5 - she liked some more than me and vice verse, but the O'Banon cheese was amazing - goat cheese with a sweet creamy dessert flavor that when mixed with the almonds and honey or the fog jam on the crackers was exceptional. All of the garnishes (not sure if that's the right word to describe the fig jam/relish, almonds and honey, crackers and cornichon pickles) were house made and excellent. "
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,Also had a draft cider that had been aged in wine barrels - very tasty.
,,,,,The menu at this place is amazing and eccentric - it's hard to decide what to try. Service at the bar was great and friendly.
,,,,,I'm bumping this to 5 stars.
,,,,,They had a lot of options!
,,,,,"I had the pork shoulder, recommended by other people at the bar. It was very rich and very good. "
,,,,,"I also had the deviled egg, which was sort of like a Scotch egg - but the inside was a creamy sauce, and the breading didn't have sausage. It was also very good."
,,,,,"Came here alone an hour and a half before close and it was packed! The staff member at the door advised me to make a round of the bar seating area for first-come-first-serve seating, and I was lucky enough to find a spot by the corner of the bar, with an incredible view of the chefs making food. "
,,,,,"What followed was what seemed like a private dinner experience : the wait staff were attentive, I got personalized recommendations on wine and food, and the food that came out was incredible.  All the suggestions provided were spot on and to my liking, and also matched the preferences I voiced. "
,,,,,"I have two complaints, however: one, since I was alone I only could try 3 things off the menu, and two, the server pressured me into dessert even though my stomach was full. (Just kidding! There was no pressure and dessert was marvelous."
,,,,,I look forward to returning to this place when I'm in town again!
,,,,,"This was also another restaurant I was highly interested trying. Party of 2 on a Thursday night, wait was about 90 minutes. This place is very tight, particularly inside. We were seated right in front of the cooks where they prepare their food, so it was a nice view the whole time. They have a very extensive menu so it can be difficult to decide. Fortunately, our server was incredibly helpful."
,,,,,Lengua and salami - Started off with this. Salami was ok but the lengua had awesome texture and flavor
,,,,,Brussels sprouts - It was cooked with a nice crisp while still tasting fresh. Recommend!
,,,,,"Bone marrow - Was a bit too rich and fatty for me. Appearance wise, it does not look too appetizing. Spread it on your bread and you're good to go."
,,,,,Grilled broccoli - This is incredibly popular here but I just found it okay. I think the sauce was too rich and changed the texture/flavor of broccoli too much.
,,,,,Pork belly - Fatty goodness with a sweet/sugary sauce. Recommend!
,,,,,"Cavatelli - Skip it, wasn't a fan. Octopus flavored pasta did not really do it for me."
,,,,,Octopus a la plancha - Flavor good. Texture - meh. Ocotpus tasted a bit overcooked and had a dry texture to it.
,,,,,Creme brûlée - I love me some pomegranate. Combine that with dark chocolate and you have an interesting take on this classic dessert.
,,,,,Bootsy Collins - Fruity gin drink. Recommend if you like gin!
,,,,,"Venue: It's a little tight and raucous, as in that bistro or brasserie way, but is tolerable. The discs is bright and well decorated. Some staff were friendlier than others, but no complaints whatsoever for the table staff."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Not much to say about The Purple Pig, which is a good thing in this case."
,,,,,"Tapas styles food, great service, great food."
,,,,,"The portions are not too big but not too small, 4 dishes should be enough to share with 3 people depending on how much your party eats."
,,,,,"I wouldn't take a date here if you're looking for something quiet and romantic, there is definitely a more talky crowd but not overwhelming loud. "
,,,,,"The milk braised Berkshire pork shoulder is my favorite on the menu here!! It's super soft full of melt in your mouth yummy goodness. The bone marrow pound cake is good too, the bone marrow adds a nice moist richness to the pound cake. A must go if you're visiting Chicago."
,,,,,This place is amazing! I loved everything and the prices were so affordable! I sat at the bar and the staff was so attentive and helpful in deciding on both food and wine
,,,,,I appreciate the nice ambience but the food is just not worth the prices.  It didn't taste that good and it definitely wasn't satisfying in any sense.  Mediocre food with tiny portions to summarize it.
,,,,,"Don't let the fact that they don't take reservations drive you away.  A 20 minute wait was easy with a great selection of wines by the glass. The plates are  a great size for sharing multiple things. So...the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter was a great start. The foi gras and brioche ice  cream , raspberry jelly and pistachio butter was a perfect match of decadence and cool decadence.  The lamb ribs were fall off the bone delicious. And the pork belly and tenderloin was a perfect pairing."
,,,,,The place was loud in a fun way...not a quiet romantic dinner. And it was not inexpensive...although my wine selections were a big part of that
,,,,,"But overall a cannot miss place when you are in Chicago...we will be back,"
,,,,,"As far as restaurant experiences go, this one had to be the worst. No reservations, so you have to stand and wait. We landed on a Saturday, made the list at 7pm, and was told it'll be a 2.5-3 hour wait. You only have 10 minutes to get back to the restaurant by the time they text you that the table is ready. If you have the yelp app, you can keep tabs on your place on the waiting list so you don't miss your table. If you come in later in the evening, you run the risk of dishes being sold out. They sat us on a 2 person table, so the table was pretty tight. The restaurant is very loud and our server was hard to reach at times because of the number of tables she was serving. I personally don't think this place is worth the 3 hour wait on a Saturday night."
,,,,,"Dishes were huge for tapas. We ordered the broccoli, the roasted beets, the half duck, and the bone marrow. The broccoli had a nice grilled flavor and the anchovy sauce reminded me of Cesar salad dressing. The pistachio butter on the roasted beets was amazing, but the goat cheese foam kind of overpowered the entire dish for us. The half duck was good, not amazing. For all the rave on yelp about the bone marrow, it just didn't deliver. It was not charred on the surface (kind of looked boiled?) and it lacked creativity as a dish overall."
,,,,,"Fantastic experience.  We came at 3 pm, yes 3 pm. And it was a 30 minute wait."
,,,,,"We got the octopus, which was the most perfectly cooked octopus I've ever had.  Crispy on the outside yet nice and tender inside and soaked up all of the flavorful pesto-like sauce.  And the pan-fried potatoes were the perfect accompaniment."
,,,,,The broccoli was as good as advertised thanks to the anchovy sauce.  Soooo good.
,,,,,And we couldn't go without the pig.  So we did the braised shoulder.  A. Maze. Ing.
,,,,,"Was in Chicago for a conference and came here on a busy Friday night. They told us the wait was 2-3 hours which was disappointing but we put in our name anyway, had a drink at another bar, and got in after 45 minutes. SO GLAD WE WAITED. "
,,,,,"Vittles: Hands down: This is one of the best meals I have had. I tried the braised pork shoulder and it was absolutely divine. Rich, hearty, and flavorful, with the right accompaniment of veggies and, thanks to the server, a well pared wine. We also partook in the deep fried chocolate dessert. Amaaaaaazing!"
,,,,,Verdict: I will definitely return when I'm in Chicago -- and I've already been referring it to others.
,,,,,A lot of people come here for the wine and cheese! The wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone here. I came for the food and I thought it was delicious! The food here is meant to be shared and that's what we did!
,,,,,"We started with the calamari. For once, we got calamari that wasn't fried and I wasn't expecting to like it, but it was one of our favorite dishes! It comes cold and with plenty of flavor. It's a very refreshing dish and I recommend it. "
,,,,,"The roasted bone marrow was tasty! It comes with an herb salad and sea salt on the side. I like that we can add our own salt to the bone marrow and the herb salad wasn't bad! It had a lot of cilantro, which I'm not too fond of, but the sauce really overpowered the cilantro so I couldn't taste much of it. "
,,,,,"Next was the milk braised Berkshire shoulder. It was soft but way too salty for us. The taste was a little heavy, especially with the mashed potatoes. "
,,,,,"Lastly, we had the turkey leg confit- one of our favorites! It was delicious and the portion was huge! It didn't have a bone in it and was so tender. The seasoning was delicious. "
,,,,,"Overall, I enjoyed the different flavors here. It was unfamiliar yet delicious. I recommend if you're in the area!"
,,,,,Food is average and small portion for entrees. I did not enjoy my meal also because they asked me twice if I'm done with eating when I'm still chewing food and my plate has some left. However they implement good Covid precautions and remind customers to keep masks on unless they are eating.
,,,,,amazing. 
,,,,,"the beets were delicious, especially with the pistachio butter. the goat cheese was also very light and subtle which i appreciated as i'm not a huge dairy fan. "
,,,,,"the gnocchi with bolognese was phenomenal, but i'm a huge sucker for gnocchi. "
,,,,,"the stuff squid was good, but the stuffing was bit on the salty side. otherwise, super delicious!!"
,,,,,The Purple Pig definitely met my high expectations!
,,,,,"We came on a Tuesday evening, hoping that our wait wouldn't be too long, and low and behold, our wait time was only 20 minutes. Located on the bustling shopping area on Michigan Ave, the Purple Pig is hard to miss."
,,,,,"They don't take reservations, so if you want to beat the crowd, plan to arrive at odd hours or weekday evenings."
,,,,,The restaurant itself is a tight space with lots and lots of people.
,,,,,Their drinks list is a extensive and I was impressed by their offerings.
,,,,,"From what we were told by our server, their menu changes very often."
,,,,,"We decided to go with our server's suggestions, and we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder, the octopus, and the ribs."
,,,,,"Our waiter was awesome....very friendly and happy to make recommendations. We ordered a wine for the table. Started with a few appetizers- I got the huevos rotos and nearly died of ecstasy they were so good and my friend ordered the grilled broccoli which was top notch. I also ordered the recommended smoked pork tongue which was like a savory chewy bacon (great choice) and the pork belly which was so tender and well prepared with the mix of flavors from the carrots and ginger glaze. I also appreciated that at a place that advertises pig, they had a lot of actually tasty vegetarian options. "
,,,,,"I will say that we were seated at a table right next to a door that opened to the outside that everyone kept coming in and out of which made for some intermittent chilly spells. The food and company was so good, it made it worth it. "
,,,,,Would definitely come back to try more on their scrumptious menu!
,,,,,"Overall, I'll give this place 5 stars primarily for the taste of the food. My only issue with places like this is I spend a lot of money but still leave hungry, which was no different here. I guess my suggestion would be don't come here if you're starving, or plan on emptying your bank account. The food, however, is always high quality."
,,,,,"I came here on a Thursday night around 7 and there was a ~45 minute wait for a party of 2. The place is very crowded and tight as most people have mentioned, but it makes sense because the place is very popular so I'd prefer that over an extra long wait. After I got the text notifying me of my table being ready, we were seated right away and our waiter was there quickly."
,,,,,"I ordered the double IPA on special (don't remember what it was) and it was pretty good, but as you'd expect for this kind of beer it was a pretty small glass and cost $8."
,,,,,"For food, we ordered the deviled eggs, octopus cavatelli, Greek sausage, and steak. In order of preference:"
,,,,,"1) steak - I cannot remember what kind of steak this was, but I know it was served with green garlic and breadcrumbs. This was definitely my favorite dish. The meat cut easily with a butter knife and it was so flavorful. There were about 4 slices on the plate, each slice being roughly 2 bites."
,,,,,"2) sausage - this was very tasty as well. No complaints, and the portion wasn't too small."
,,,,,"3) deviled egg - this was the best deviled egg I've ever had, but I was a little disappointed that the order only came with 1 egg for $8."
,,,,,4) cavatelli - this dish was a decent portion size but I thought the sauce lacked flavor.
,,,,,"This place will always be my number 1 restaurant in Chicago. I've referred a few people here and they all loved it! My favorite dish would have to be the asparagus... how can anyone mix peanut butter, pesto, and yuzu together and have it be Soooo Good????? Just WOW!"
,,,,,"This place brought me to some culinary peaks and some flops. Expect to be seated elbow to elbow with your neighbours because the restaurant is laid out to optimize for maximum seating. The asparagus risotto and the octopus were so good I could weep, but the foie gras was a bit of disappointment. "
,,,,,"This isn't the type of place you'd want to cheap out at, if you don't know what to order be sure to ask your server for their recommendations. "
,,,,,"Definitely worth a visit if you're visiting Chicago. It's walk-in only, so get here early (close to opening) put your name and number down and explore the river or neighbouring shops."
,,,,,Food comes out incredibly fast. It literally felt like we had just ordered when our dishes came out.
,,,,,Let me start off with the milk braised pork shoulder. The meat was super soft and literally melted in my mouth. It came with mashed potatoes and I can't stop thinking about how the combination was the perfect match!
,,,,,"Now, the octopus was what blew me away. It was tender and soft and cooked to perfection. The consistency of the meat was mind-boggling since my experience with octopus has always been super chewy, but this was not the case!"
,,,,,"Finally, the ribs were just what I had thought they would be... amazing! The meat fell off the bones with just a little tap of my knife and fork. The sauce was tangy and not too sweet."
,,,,,"I wish I could've tried other dishes, but honestly, that felt enough for the two of us. "
,,,,,"For a restaurant of this caliber, one would expect the price to be high. It was totally fine worth the experience and we left with happy tummies!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"If you are looking for a trendy, fun place, with great ambiance, this is the spot for you. The food was very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese plate and the ricotta gnocchi was delicious. I hope you enjoyed this review, amongst the 6,000 other, probably better written reviews. Thank you."
,,,,,"AMAZING place!! My boyfriend and I decided to stop by this place because it was highly recommended by a few friends of ours. It also has amazing reviews so why not?! And this place definitely didn't disappoint at all! We wanted to order 2-3 dishes since it's a tapas place however the portion is HUGE. We definitely could have been completely full with only 2 dishes. We got the turkey leg (MASSIVE!!! delicious and tender), the pork shoulder (the sauce is amazing), and a pasta (wouldn't recommend pastas here because all the other dishes are so unique so I would spend money on others instead). I would totally recommend this place if you're in Chicago, it's a must!"
,,,,,"What stood out even more than the food (which was incredible) was the fact that the service was phenomenal. When we arrived we were greeted by two separate waitstaff offering water and to explain the menu. Throughout the meal they checked in clearing plates, refilling water and confirming our satisfaction of the dishes but we're never invasive. "
,,,,,"The drink menu options alone can make you dizzy (in a good way), and the menu is set up for sharing with everything from cheese and charcuterie selections to chicken kabobs over smashed potatoes. So. Many. Choices!  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and beautifully displayed.  I highly recommend this spot whether you are a Chi-town native or taking in the windy city over a whirlwind weekend visit."
,,,,,We were walking towards some awesome Chicago destination when we noticed a line forming. So of course we stood in line and then asked what the line was for! We looked the place up on Yelp while waiting. .The reviews were fantastic. My wife said she had already found a ton of good Yelp reviews on this place while we were in the airport in Orlando.
,,,,,"The line moved quickly, the staff were very efficient. The waitress was speedy, but she took the time to help my wife with her allergies. The chef came out and asked her a few questions and they gave her about 5 good options. It seems like everything on the menu is good, so we were happy."
,,,,,"We ordered a few items and they were all very tasty. I'm kind of harsh on restaurants and 4 stars from me, means I loved this place. Items come out in not quite as small as tapas portions. I would have like to see the price just a little bit lower, the value wasn't the greatest. But let's be honest, I was on vacation. I can only eat at finite number of restaurants while on vacation, so it's worth it to me to eat at one of the best. "
,,,,,I would definitely be happy eating here again if we ever visit Chicago again.
,,,,,"While visiting Chicago for a long weekend, my boyfriend and I wanted to try out The Purple Pig and this was mainly due to all the great reviews and menu options they have."
,,,,,"I have a dairy allergy and our server, Audrey, actually took the menu and researched each dishes ingredients. She checked off all of the safe menu options that we could choose from. I've never had a server take the time to do this and I don't think I could express how appreciated it was."
,,,,,"The food was PHENOMENAL. Go here, get the scallops (if you're into seafood) and enjoy!"
,,,,,Wow! Wow! Wow! So glad our plans got a little messed up and we ended up here early this passed Saturday. Everything we put in our mouths was 5 Stars. The only problem you will have here is deciding what to order. We ordered the whipped feta- oh man still tasting this dish. The broccoli- yep broccoli was a favorite. Julienned fried pig ears with the pickled peppers- pork shoulder- and stuffed squid were all home runs. Don't let the communal tables scare you away from dining here- everyone's faces are down in their plates so you don't have to make eye contact if you don't want to. So Amazing we have figured a way to come here for a quick day trip from RI for brunch in March- yes a 12 Hour trip just to eat here again.
,,,,,"This place was so absolutely delicious. Best lunch I've had in the foreseeable past. The service was impeccable and never wanted for anything. Great wine selection. Delicious food. Pork blade steak with sobrasado and arugula salad was delicious, but the pork belly and tenderloin with a ginger glaze, carrots, and beets was my absolute favorite. The chef showed insane skill with the tenderness and perfection of each bite."
,,,,,I had so many recommendations from friends to come here so I had to see what the hype was all about.
,,,,,My boyfriend and I weren't that hungry yet but knew that it was going to be a 2 hour wait so we walked down here to put our name and number down and went to go explore downtown and grabbed some pre dinner drinks.
,,,,,"I leaned on Yelp to tell me what to order and it did not disappoint! I ordered the bone marrow, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder, and crispy pig ears. The bone marrow was ginormous but it was the best bone marrow either one of us had ever tried. We needed more bread to finish the bone marrow! It was so simple but so delicious. Everything was just so equally delicious and unique in it's own way. The octopus was the best we ever had also. It wasn't tough or chewy at all. The milk braised pork shoulder was so tender that we were only given a spoon to cut through it. The crispy pig ears were nicely fried and was packed with flavor."
,,,,,This is a definite must visit when in Chicago.
,,,,,Top freaking notch.
,,,,,Sit at the bar to the left and watch their amazing cooking and pick your next item from what looks the best!
,,,,,"Service from Troy was incredible, so definitely request him!"
,,,,,Cheese plates are decadent and broccoli is a can't miss.
,,,,,100% recommend!
,,,,,What a treat! The tapas selections are so inviting and thoughtfully prepared.  The chefs have truly thought through your dining experience.
,,,,,Great atmosphere. Great staff.  You will not be disappointed!

,,,,,"Came here at 11pm on Thursday. The restaurant was packed, but luckily there was a table available. Definitely try to get here early if you're coming in a big group."
,,,,,Ordered two dishes to split between 2 people just to address our late-night fix.
,,,,,salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter- this is a definite must try. Beets were cooked just right and I loved the mixture of the cheese and pistachio butter. Couldn't stop eating this dish
,,,,,"milk braised pork shoulder- this was very good. the pork is very tender and the sauce was rich and perfectly salted. it was a good mix getting the beets and pork shoulder as they complemented each other. however, you can probably do a great job of making pork shoulder that is more or less as tasty, so I would probably try something else on the menu if I come back"
,,,,,"Purple pig had great food, excellent service, and is located in the main part of the city. Absolutely loved every aspect of my dining experience here, and will definitely return the next time I visit Chicago."
,,,,,"Oh I've missed you Purple Pig! Although this place is obviously popular for its pork- the seafood is amazing as well (except the squid ink ravioli- it's one of the nastiest things I've ate). The service was alright- seem like she was a little annoyed. The restaurant itself is either too loud inside or too hot outside. No reservations, so there'll probably be like a 20-30 min wait, but there's so much to do in that area aka shopping! "
,,,,,Octopus ($22)-4.5/5 One of my absolute favorite dishes to get here! The octopus is cooked nicely -crispy outside and tender inside. The sauce was delicious as well and paired nicely! 
,,,,,"Squid Ink Ravioli ($20)-1/5 No No No!! This is honestly one of the worst dishes I've had in a while. Corn and snow crab- didn't sound too bad huh? Rarely any snow crab and lots of corn (I kinda hate corn in soupy texture though). The Ravioli is just filled with corn flavor like soup. And they only give you 3 ravioli (thank god, cause it actually tastes really bad). "
,,,,,"Branzino ($18)-4/5 I love me some fish, but this was CHARRED, to the point that you could taste it. It was a little bitter, but so great for summer because the broth was cool and super tasty and the fish was hot."
,,,,,"Okay this is real. I love this place, and it makes me melt inside. You know you're an adult when you eat here. The staff makes me want to work here. They joke, entertain, work, and hustle all at the same time. They introduce you to new wine, drinks, and food you know old enough to try now. My family had a garden, and I hated beets, and I would never eat them. Purple Pig, makes this Pistachio butter, beets, and cheese dish that has me going in circles every time I eat it. The lamb they serve falls off the bone, and makes me want to eat all night. Liked the old location more but with pandemic haven't been there much."
,,,,,"A-mazing, a must eat place in Chicago!! I had heard a lot about this place when researching for our visit to Chicago and planned it out so that we could eat here one evening. The other reviewers were correct in that they do not take reservations and it is important to get their early and put your name down. At 7:00pm on a Saturday there was an 1.5 hour wait and we were seated at our table around 8:10.. so off to a good start! "
,,,,,"When we sat down the waitress was quiet and the restaurant was noisy so we were a bit confused about how the restaurant worked, but we quickly figured it out. You order ""small"" plates to share, typically 3-4 plates for two people and then the servers bring them to your table to share as the chef makes them. We decided to try different dishes from different sections. Delicious!! "
,,,,,"Okay so now the important info on the food- we started with Kerry Gold cheese and pino noir jelly. It was very good but ""least"" favorite of all the dishes. The second dish was the grilled broccoli in an amazing sauce and this broccoli was unlike any I had ever tasted. The best broccoli I have EVER had!! The broccoli and scallion garganelli tie for my favorite. The homemade pasta and sweet flavorful sauce were something my taste buds will never forget! Finally we shared the pork blade steak with arugula salad. It was the perfect finish to our evening but we couldn't finish it all after our three other dishes (we had LOTS of broccoli). Next visit to Chicago we will be back to try more of their food! Hopefully they can too our amazing experience!"
,,,,,"Food was served really fast, it's really good cause we were all hungry. "
,,,,,"But the octopus tasted rubbery, which is very disappointed. And everything we order was too salty that day. "
,,,,,But the service was good though.
,,,,,The service was not amazing. After being seated and we ordered and I had to make a couple adjustments due to some allergies I have. One of the meals came out wrong and the waiter gave me an awful attitude after I nicely mentioned I needed a new without nuts which made me feel bad about having ordered it at all. The chicken thigh kebabs were incredible!!! That was my favorite part and the smashed potatoes that came with it were delicious. We ordered the beets which were a bit too sweet and the broccoli was VERYYY oily. I don't think anything was amazing about this place. I don't think I would come back based on the overall experience.
,,,,,"We waited for about 2.25 hours for our table. During the wait, we hung out in the front of the restaurant and ordered a few drinks, where there were servers walking around taking orders. "
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"We ordered a few dishes but the only ones, I did remember were the ones I took pictures of. The dishes here are tapas, so make sure to order a few so you get your bellies full and get a taste of their extensive menu. They have something for everyone! "
,,,,,"The Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg ($10) was Egg-ceptional!! We also ordered the Beef Coppa Steak, which comes with pommery mayo, radishes and preserved tomatoes ($17). This dish was sweet and savory and really hit the spot."
,,,,,"I absolutely love this restaurant! From delicious and creative dishes to delightful staff, what's not to love?! "
,,,,,The first time I visited The Purple Pig I had to wait about an hour and a half as I had a party of 7 with no reservation and it was a Friday night. The great thing about going with a large group is being able to try out over 10 dishes (we placed 2 orders of some dishes with a group this large) without breaking the bank. 
,,,,,"The second time I visited was a Sunday around 3 pm so my friend and I didn't have to wait at all. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 3 dishes which was the perfect amount of food for us both. During both of these visits, the waiters were so helpful with their recommendations as well. I'm hoping to visit again soon."
,,,,,The food was tasty and prepared perfectly. Very tasty starters and mains. You definitely enjoy your meal here. Good drinks as well. Must try the Cheesecake and the Brownies were great.
,,,,,After following the pig chicago on instagram for a while I decided that I wanted to come here for my birthday dinner!
,,,,,"Nestled right off the magnificent mile is this super cozy spot with a great bar that you can have dinner at, or tables to enjoy your fare. They don't take reservations so if you want a table, come early. And bring your whole party because they won't seat you unless everyone is there."
,,,,,"We opted to sit at the bar since the wait for a table was at least 45 minutes and I was hungry. We ordered this specialty tequila drink which was just the right amount of tequila, not overpowering at all. I had two in fact! My friend and I decided that we wanted to split a couple of dishes from the menu so we could enjoy many things and not get full. Our appetizer was the eggplant caponata which was a party in your mouth of flavor. I even ate the bread! We started with the broccoli which was in this sauce that will wow you. It's sautéed well but the flavor was out of this world. Next we tried the pork shoulder (we really wanted the pork belly but it is limited and was sold out by the time we ordered it). It came with polenta and gravy and was so tender it literally melted with each cut. Our third course was the octopus which was very tender and not at all rubbery or tasting or fishy. Finally, we ended with the bone marrow. Now, if you don't know bone marrow or have never tried it, this is the place to give it a whirl. It comes with some bread, cilantro, and a pinch of salt. I ate it straight off the bone it was one of the best bone marrow I've tried, and I've tried it a few different places. Simply melts in your mouth. Perfecto!"
,,,,,I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with a nice variety of food. The prices are reasonable. And the food is simply awesome. I'll definitely be back as I continue to eat my way through the menu.
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,This place is a Chicago staple and one of the BEST tapas restaurants I've ever been to... I had the summer squash and the turkey leg confit. The portions are much bigger than any other tapas bar I've visited. The atmosphere is great and lends itself to friendly conversation. The wait staff is very friendly and informative with recommended pairings. Don't leave without trying one of their house made cheeses or meats. This is truly a wonderful experience while visiting Chicago!
,,,,,"Holyyyyyy cow. I have always wanted to try this place and it was amazing. I actually came here alone and ended up sitting next to a woman and we ordered a few different things and split the check. So much fun!! She had already ordered the eggplant caponata and That was delicious. We also got the Ricotta Gnocci which came with a pork neck-bone gravy, stuffed squid as well as the lamb ribs and oh my word everything was delicious. I canNOT wait to come back. It was everything that I hoped it would be! It was extremely busy even on a Monday night so anticipate there being a wait, especially if you have 2+ people in your party!"
,,,,,Had high expectations and it was good... but not great.  each dish had a couple issues that I found made it hard to justify the price point. 
,,,,,Started off on a good note. Our waitress was nice and recommended a very good 2010 French wine. Would recommend this one as it had a nice fullness and many interesting flavours. 
,,,,,"Ordered pork jowl, pork tongue, garganelli pasta, roasted artichoke, and confit turkey leg. "
,,,,,"Jowl - this was like a piece of toast with mushroom, tomato, yogurt and then jowl. The jowl was cooked great but way salty and the ratio of yogurt to the rest was way off. The whole thing was too sour and you could barely taste the jowl. "
,,,,,Pork tongue- similar comments as the jowl. I liked the tongue more than the rest of the ingredients used. 
,,,,,Artichoke- the artichokes were great. Amazing texture and taste. But came with potatoes which were overly sour.. very overpowering. 
,,,,,"Garganelli - this was quite good. It was paired with a nice sobrasada. Sauce was vry hearty, once again kinda on the salty side. "
,,,,,Confit - this was the best dish. I found the Swiss chard it was with to be really sweet because it was smothered in sauce but the leg itself was great.
,,,,,What I ordered:
,,,,,Crispy Pig Ears - the pig ears are sliced thinly like chips. It's not the chewy texture atypical to pig ear dishes.
,,,,,Spanish Octopus - octopus is very tender and the salsa verde sauce is delicious
,,,,,"Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder - the pork is really tender and the combo of the pork, mashed potatoes, and greens is perfection"
,,,,,What I recommend:
,,,,,Everything I've ordered!
,,,,,"Outstanding dishes ! We had the best salad. Delightful. Would have never paired beets and peanut butter/sauce, but it was a great combo. The heirloom tomato salad was the very best salad I have had in a long while. Sweet grapes, pear with great tomatoes in a perfectly balanced vinegarette chilled to perfection. The papperdelle pasta was fresh and delicate."
,,,,,"Love this place always has great food and great atmosphere. While there is communal seating which helps push people into the door, I would still stay away during the obvious busy times. Some dishes have been not what I expected, however the pork shoulder is always my go to here. Love the place and try to visit when possible."
,,,,,ULTRA VIOLET SWINE
,,,,,Terrific tapas and vino tinto are the modus operandi at this *insanely good* Mag Mile restaurant (one of Chicago's hottest).
,,,,,"I'd known of this place from LeAnn P, but it wasn't until dinner on 2/22/17 with a certain mom that made me understand why a venue specializing in small plates would have such a strong positive rating across almost 5K reviews."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig operates on a first come/first serve basis, which means you can't make a rez to guarantee your party's seating.  Even though you can bank on TPP being crowded at ANY time of the day or night, expect a considerable wait if you arrive after 6pm."
,,,,,"Tucked away off of Michigan Ave, TPP (a.k.a. ""The Fuchsia Porker"") has a small dining room and a lively -- but deafeningly loud -- environment.  Communal seating is just how these guys play the game; if you value your personal space and quiet time then maybe this isn't the spot for you."
,,,,,"But if you can handle tight quarters and noisy atmosphere, then you will go absolutely hog wild for the items their kitchen cranks out.  Although I would encourage adventuresome eaters to order an entrée or two, it's truly the appetizers and hors d'oeuvres that stand out the most."
,,,,,"Before I drop some serious beats on the culinary breakdown, I wanted to give props to TPP's massive wine selection.  I enjoyed large pours of a Bordeaux ($12 per 9oz glass) and noted many others that'd pair nicely with their charcuterie boards.  Now onto the good sh*t:"
,,,,,"¶ broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, anchovy vinaigrette ($8)"
,,,,,"One of TPP's signature dishes, the broc was cooked to the ideal level of tenderness.  The breadcrumbs added a lovely texture of crunch and the anchovy vinaigrette was salty without being overwhelming.  A must order."
,,,,,"¶ meat & cheese tray [guanciale and hook's blue] with sliced cornichons, crispy pita, & fig mostarda ($16)"
,,,,,"Instead of jamón ibérico (a personal fave), my mom opted for 'guanciale' which is the fatty sibling of prosciutto.  Accompanying that was a firmer, milder blue cheese (when compared to your typical Stilton or Roquefort) as well as crispy pita triangles, sweet-brined cornichon pickles and a delightful fig mostarda."
,,,,,"¶ duck liver pâté with lightly dressed field greens, grapes & crostini ($12)"
,,,,,"The pâté itself was lighter than air and the plating was tasteful, but otherwise nothing terribly out of the ordinary."
,,,,,"¶ potato ice cream with ossetra caviar, purple chips & crème fraîche ($18)"
,,,,,"Runner-up to best dish of the evening was this whimsical cold plate which was JUST as awesome as it sounds.  The potato ice cream was unlike anything we'd ever tasted and reminded us of the ""french fries"" liquid nitrogen dish from our meal at EL Ideas.  The crème fraîche atop the striking purple chips was a snazzy touch."
,,,,,¶ salted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter ($9)
,,,,,"This was the one that brought me to tears.  Diced beets were plated with a miraculously airy goat cheese and a very unique, VERY good smear fashioned from pistachios.  Imagine the greatest, smoothest peanut butter ever made, now add in a touch of honey for sweetener and you'll get an idea of what this was like. MARVELOUS."
,,,,,¶ Meyer lemon bar with olive oil sorbet ($9)
,,,,,"This dessert was the perfect balance of flavor and texture: a tart lemon curd over a shortbread base and crispy rice pearls, with a subtle olive oil sorbet and light caramel drizzle.  Tangy and playful!"
,,,,,"¶ Poached pears with amaretto cake, pear sorbet, & chocolate gelée ($9)"
,,,,,"Easily the best-plated dish of the evening, the attention to detail was exemplary.  Pears poached in red wine along with a refreshing pear sorbet joined a wonderful amaretto cake and an unusual sheet of cocoa gelatin."
,,,,,Bread = 5+
,,,,,Circuses = 5
,,,,,"Service wise, it really couldn't have been much better.  The level of attentiveness matched that of many Michelin places and despite not receiving any ""explanations"" of dishes, everyone from the guys who cleared the table to the girl who sat us were both polite and vigilant.  We never encountered a problem and water glasses rarely (if ever) got below halfway.  Pure professionalism."
,,,,,:VERDICT:
,,,,,"Jimmy Bannos Jr and his staff of servers, hostesses and chefs absolutely SLAYED IT.  Every single person working here had a great upbeat attitude, although it was the kitchen whose stellar plate presentation and flawless execution of dishes left me stunned.  A legit dinner for two with drinks + tax + tip ran an even $200, but it was worth. every. penny."
,,,,,"Without a doubt one of Chicago's best restaurants and the greatest meal I've had in many moons.  A superlative experience from top to bottom, I'll be recommending The Purple Pig to not just friends & relatives, I'll be preaching the good word to randos on the street."
,,,,,".....so if you see some crazy guy running up and down Michigan Ave shouting things about salted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter, pay him no heed......he just really, really likes TPP (and he thinks you will, too)."
,,,,,"Being our first visit to Chicago, we asked multiple Uber drivers and locals where their favorite spots were downtown. The Purple Pig came up multiple times in those conversations. My wife and I ended up going twice for dinner in the 5 nights we were in town. It's incredible!"
,,,,,We went both times at odd dining hours as we were told it is normally packed with long wait times. We didn't have to wait to be seated either time we went. 
,,,,,Highly recommend the chicken thigh kebabs and broccoli. Service was great and fast both times!
,,,,,The Purple Pig is a must do while in downtown Chicago.
,,,,,Amazing food and taste. Popular spot to eat in Chicago and definitely worth the wait. Get there early to make sure your wait time is less since they do not take reservations.  Not one plate I had was disappointing. Great wine selection as well. Plates come out at the chef prepares them to allow food to be as freshly cooked as possible. The team working there is a synchronous machine making your experience seamless. 
,,,,,To name a few. 
,,,,,The Pig ears
,,,,,The Cheese plate was amazing. 
,,,,,The fish special that day was amazing 
,,,,,The duck a must have. 
,,,,,Milk braised pork shoulder
,,,,,Wonderful place. Insta-worthy food. Creative.
,,,,,"If you like pork and anything related to edible pig parts, go here asap. This restaurant is deserving of such a prime location in Chicago, and even of its foodie status. There will be a line but do not let it intimidate you - it will move quickly. Wait staff are incredibly efficient while courteous. Everything on the menu will be absolutely delicious. Most things will be tasty right off the bat, despite of the menu descriptions that might sound off-putting at first. The items will come to you SLIGHTLY larger than tapas. Don't expect to get so full, though. It's a 1-2 plates per person sort of restaurant. Price will be premium, again given its location and cuisine. Oh, and get the bone marrow."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"We'd tried going here before at it's previous location, to no avail. I was hoping that rolling in at like 4 on a tues in the new location would be a win, and I was right!"
,,,,,"This place is cute and still small. I can't imagine how small the previous place was. Service was prompt, attentive, and friendly."
,,,,,"We sat at the bar, and again, I was blown away by the wine selections here. I've been thoroughly impressed with the places we've been in Chicago."
,,,,,"We started with the bone marrow. While it was good, the accompanying salad if you will was the effing winner. The freshness of the cilantro/parsley/lemon on the fatty marrow was magical."
,,,,,We then had the smoked pork tongue. Uh-mazing. The perfect bites.
,,,,,"THEN the octopus. Perfect. I think while the octopus itself was perfect, somehow the green beans were our favorite? I love when veg can so truly be the star."
,,,,,"We then wrapped up our visit with some guava? sorbet and poppyseed something er other. I don't know, but it was effing delicious."
,,,,,"Not gonna lie. I was quite tipsy, full of delicious food, and totally missed my flight and I have no regrets!"
,,,,,"I have lived in Chicago for 2.5 years and have heard really good things about the purple pig. It's one of those restaurants that tourists always try to eat at when they come visit Chicago (along with girl & the goat, publican, wild berry, au cheval, etc). So I thought I'd finally give it a try. My boyfriend and I opted for an early dinner and came at 5pm on a Sunday night because we really did not want to have to wait for a table. They had a table for two inside but we decided to sit outside since it was a milder winter evening (upper 30s). They do have heat lamps outside. Still chilly but we kept our coats on. It was much more peaceful outside. The small inside space makes it really loud and hard to have conversation. Service was good. "
,,,,,The waiter recommended ordering 3-4 plates to share between 2 people. We ordered the following:
,,,,,"- Crispy pig's ears $15- kale, pickled cherry peppers, fried egg"
,,,,,"- Milk braised Berkshire shoulder $19- mashed potatoes, crispy lentils"
,,,,,"- Seared scallops $20- creamy polenta, Romesco + charred ramps"
,,,,,"- Octopus a la plancha $23- green beans, fingerling potatoes, salsa verde"
,,,,,"All of these were popular plates that the waiter recommended except for the scallops (we just love scallops). The crispy pig's ears, arguably one of the purple pig's most popular dishes, was too salty for my liking. The milk braised Berkshire shoulder was very tender. The seared scallops were good but there were only 2. A bit pricey for just two scallops. The octopus was on the oily side without enough flavor. "
,,,,,"Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by this popular, highly ranked restaurant. Worth a try, but with all the other good restaurants in Chicago, I probably won't revisit this one."
,,,,,"Okay so the wait is crazy. Gotta expect that. But you can order drinks while waiting outside. They have a very extensive beer and wine menu, and if you want the best non-alcoholic drink ever, ask for the Baladin Cedrata citrus sparkling soda. It was amazing! "
,,,,,"We then got in and wow, the food is worth the hype. Our party of 8 sat down and served the plates family style. I tried the risotto, the chicken thigh skewers, and the grilled broccoli (mind blowing, by the way). I originally was the only one who wanted the broccoli but after they tried it, we ordered a second plate of it! The rest of the table enjoyed some fish and pork plates, and everyone loved it. "
,,,,,Highly recommended - be prepared to wait. It's worth it :-)
,,,,,"Great vibe, ambience, crowd, location, menu, staff, service etc."
,,,,,I had heard about the Purple Pig from family and friends therefore I had to try it. 
,,,,,"Thanks to another fellow Yelper, I decided to try the broccoli. Boy was it fabulous! Cooked to perfection, moist yet crispy topping (panka perhaps), great taste and good portion."
,,,,,"I also had the lamb-absolutely a must try. It was tender-the meat fell off the bones. No fat, clean meat and tasty."
,,,,,Also had spicy margaritas very well made.
,,,,,My neighbors had the beef tenderloin and octopus. Both looked wonderful and were thoroughly enjoyed.
,,,,,Can't wait go go back!!!
,,,,,"I went here with my girlfriend when visiting Chicago. We heard so much about the food scene in here but by far, our favorite spot, possibly all time, was the Purple Pig. "
,,,,,"First off. The line is out the freakin door. You have to get there at a reasonable hour or you are going to wait 1-2 hours (for one of the best meals you'll have). We got there and waited about 45 minutes which was understandable, for me at least it made it all more while!! "
,,,,,"We sat down and the atmosphere inside is just flowing. My gf and I love tapas because places like this always brings out the best in people, people sharing stories and laughs all over food makes the experience that much better. "
,,,,,"Our waiter was A-1. Nicest guy I think I met in Chicago, shout out to him."
,,,,,The drinks 9/10 - a great mix of different libations and ingredients
,,,,,"Food 11/10 - it was just phenomenal. We had the bone marrow, croquettes, chicken bolognese, Berkshire pork shoulder and few other tidbits. Executed perfectly and came out timely"
,,,,,Overall the experience was amazing from top to bottom. If I could give this place a 6/5 I would.
,,,,,This restaurant has been on my list for a few years and I was surprised by the number of veggie options. Unfortunately it was a tad chilly and we were seated outdoors with no heat lamp so that was a bummer. But the restaurant was packed at 530pm and they don't take reservations so this speaks volume!
,,,,,Usually about 2 dishes per person is recommended. We got the following:
,,,,,1) cornbread- was good and moist but probably the one dish I wouldn't order next time and instead pick a different appetizer to try
,,,,,2) whipped feta- this is a great dish but there is so much feta! We dipped the next two dishes in the feta and it was really good. The date chips are light and really need a side of bread. We did order a side so feel free to do so!
,,,,,3) cauliflower- by far my favorite and it paired well with the feta! Had some pickles in it too!
,,,,,4) potatoes- another one of my favorite dishes. The potatoes were not warm but they could have cooled off quickly b.c it was chilly out. The sauces were amazing!!
,,,,,5) itta - a lot of folks raved about this but I wasn't much of a fan. Loved the crust - best way to describe it is a cross between a donut and bagel crust. There was too much ricotta filling and again it was lukewarm but this may have been due to the weather
,,,,,Perfect spot for summer drinks and appetizers!
,,,,,Adam is the best!!!!!!!
,,,,,Had an unmemorable experience with the hostess but Adam made everything 100! 
,,,,,"Had a short 45 min squeeze in between checking out of my hotel + checking in for a flight at Midway. Just HAD to check out Purple Pig. Arrived shortly after 11:30am on a Tuesday, promptly seated and was on my way by 12:15pm - now that is efficiency!"
,,,,,"The dishes made its way out of their kitchen at lightning speed. At 11:50 the entire place was sufficiently packed. I ordered the Pig's Ear (decent but would pass next time),  the milk braised pork shoulder (AMAZING) and the octopus (my FAVE!). 3 dishes were perfect for two of us - in fact the portions are on the larger side. Topped it off with a glass of chards. Perfect last meal in Chi - thanks Purple Pig!!"
,,,,,Food was certainly tasty but I don't think it's worth a 3.5hr wait. 
,,,,,TPP certainly has the reputation in town-everyone always says you have to try it. We were in town for a wedding and were told the same. So we tried (yes on a Saturday night) to call ahead and were told it would be that long to wait but could try to walk in for the bar/butcher block. Well we lucked out and walked straight to the BB and grabbed a spot. Standing room only-not ideal for my pregnant wife- and tried a few dishes. 
,,,,,They were great! Just not 3hr great and definitely not I have to stand only to eat this great. I kept scoping out the seating bar area and saw that there were literally people standing behind the poor folks who were eating waiting to take their space. I don't know about the average person but that would definitely make me feel unwelcome at best and unable to enjoy my meal if I had someone staring at me waiting for me to finish. 
,,,,,"Maybe it's a Chicago thing (nothing against the city, we had a blast overall) but I noticed a lot of restaurants don't take reservations. TPP is probably following suit but I find it to be an annoying practice at best. "
,,,,,"Would I return here? Probably not. Again, the food is good but I just have no desire to try and fight for a table when I'm in town visiting friends or for a conference. Service was great, even for the busy Saturday night and our waiter had some great choices for bourbon for me and was spot on when I told him what I like. Just -2 stars for the whole system."
,,,,,"I ordered the potato salad, grilled broccoli, chicken thighs, and corn bread. First, my group was seated at the community table. The hostess total me I could only sit in the seat She wanted me to sit in. (Girl please!) I had to speak to someone else to seat where I felt most comfortable at the community table while making it easy to seat other guests. Other than the hostess chick service was great. "
,,,,,"Now for food! If I were you, I wouldn't do the broccoli and the potato salad. Waaaaaaaaay to acidic! Independently the flavors were great but together it was too much. I didnt like the cheese on the corn bread(they were doing too much). I really like the chicken thigh skewers! "
,,,,,I think its a pretty decent spot but I dont know what the hype was all about.
,,,,,We love this place.  We ate at the bar and had a few appetizers.  The meatballs were especially good.  
,,,,,"If you are looking for a very casual environment where the food is very reasonably priced, this place is great.  When there is a wait it is not terrible. "
,,,,,It is quite crowded inside so you feel in the mix at all times.  When you see how small the open kitchen is it is hard to believe it.  The cooks are basically all touching each other in a very tiny space.  
,,,,,The beer was good and the food was good.  This was our third time here.  I would recommend it.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"My favorite place in the city. This place is a foodies heaven. I've been here so many times but there's a few things I always have to order: the bone marrow, calamari (cold dish) and the braised milk pork shoulder. Everything here is good- never had a bad meal. Good place for sharing. Tapas style"
,,,,,"My favorite place in the city. This place is a foodies heaven. I've been here so many times but there's a few things I always have to order: the bone marrow, calamari (cold dish) and the braised milk pork shoulder. Everything here is good- never had a bad meal. Good place for sharing. Tapas style."
,,,,,"So I'll start off by saying that the wait was atrocious and their open seating policy for the bar is aggressive and awful and that's literally the only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5. It killed 30 minutes of my time and was just super unpleasant. Of course the aggressive guys got seats before me even though they got there after me. Also, it's generally just rude to have people staring you down as you're finishing your meal. NOT a fan -- they are way too popular to have this arrangement."
,,,,,"That said, the food was amazing! My friend told me to get the broccoli and I was suspicious but the recommendation really held up. It was the best broccoli I've ever had. I also had the pork belly and it was literally perfect. Definitely recommend but expect to have a long wait."
,,,,,Oh my god.
,,,,,"Whenever someone recommends a popular restaurant in a new city, I always get super hyped up but get disappointed afterwards, but..."
,,,,,Oh my god. 
,,,,,The purple pig. was. effing. amazing.
,,,,,"First of all, you can't book a reservation, you just have to show up and wait, which was AWESOME because I always forget to make reservation ahead of time anyways. The fact that I get to eat at a super popular restaurant by just waiting for an hour or so is perfect. "
,,,,,"Second, holy moly, the food was MIND-BLOWING. I don't think I've ever had food with such amazing flavors. Each dish was more amazing than the last. We started off with the octopus which was perfectly seasoned and cooked, super tender with a nice touch of acidity. The orecchiette pasta had this AMAZING marinara sauce that I've never tasted anywhere else, the pasta was also cooked EXACTLY al dente and not chewy. I've been to tons of Italian restaurants that don't even cook pasta this well. I've been to ITALY three times in my life and haven't had pasta that was this good. Last but not least, the pork jowl. Oh my god, the pork jowl. You know how in food competition, the judge says, ""Wow, this dish made perfect sense, every single component of this dish is very well balanced. There's a bit of heat, acidity, salt, sourness...etc."" and you have no idea what they're talking about? The pork jowl IS THAT DISH. To be honest, I was super sick and had a stuffy nose that blunted like 50% of my taste but I was STILL blown away by all the flavors.  It just makes me wonder how it would taste if I wasn't sick...Hmm.. definitely gonna find out next time I visit Chicago..."
,,,,,I'll start by saying the review is not based on the food.  It's based on the experience I had last night at the restaurant.
,,,,,"They don't take reservations or wait lists.  I understand that about a place - not that I love it b/c it's then hard to get in.  Last night - a little before 5 pm, we were five blocks from the Pig and called to ask how long a wait would be for two people.  If it was too long, we were going to veer directions and walk to another dinner place."
,,,,,"The person who answered the phone told us, there was no wait and they could seat us now - subject to us arriving.  She repeated that twice to us.  So - we walked the five blocks there.  We were there in less than 7 minutes from our phone call."
,,,,,"We get there...and we're told it's 35-45 minute wait for two people.  I look at her (and I'm pretty sure she's the one we spoke to on the phone) and ask her ""how in 7 minutes, it went from no wait to almost 45 min?""  I was guessing a 10 min wait tops.  She said ""we had a line out the door.""  Why didn't she tell us that on the phone???  What did she hope to gain by lying to us on the phone?"
,,,,,We will not be back.  We've had the food before and it's not worth that frustration.  So many other restaurants in the city with just as good as food and a much better customer service.
,,,,,"The interior is decorated nicely. The space is a good size-doesn't feel overcrowded. Didn't love the overall aesthetic-some of the decor doesn't go well with each other, but regardless if the food was great it is easily something that could be looked past. With that said, the food was TERRIBLE and the service was below average. To start, we ordered the pig feet, Brussels sprouts, lamb, and the octopus. The pig feet were extremely salty, to the point where I felt I needed to chug my entire water glass. I could not finish it. The Brussels sprouts were good. The lamb was not good at all with chunks of cartilage that my boyfriend literally was spitting out at points. The octopus was too chewy and the sauce was not tasty. "
,,,,,"Now this may just be one women's opinion, but I feel as though others would agree with me if they tasted these dishes. I was pretty surprised to only see 4 and 5 stars on this page. I have also heard rave reviews about purple pig so have been excited to try it for a while. I was sorely disappointed, but perhaps my palate is simply not accustomed to these flavors/dishes."
,,,,,Wow. This place is pretty incredible. I have never been to a place that keeps you smiling from the moment you step in to the moment you step out (apart from when you see the prices on the menu!). 
,,,,,This restaurant works in a bit of a tapas style. You order mini dishes for the table and you all share it. I thoroughly enjoyed the roasted cauliflower. The seasoning was amazing- I wish I had asked them what was in it because it was just that good. 
,,,,,The lighting was dim and gave the place a very fancy kind of vibe. Our waiter was amazing and treated us very well. 
,,,,,"All in all, this is a perfect dinner time area for date nights or large groups."
,,,,,"Was visiting Chicago, my favorite City, for a Bachelorette weekend. Amongst the funfilled events of complete debauchery I had to carve out sometime to eat at a resturant I've wanted to eat at for sometime now but have never had the chance during my former business trips to ChiTown. "
,,,,,"Located at the center of the Magnificent Mile, The Purple Pig is a must visit. It's small and you might find yourself sharing a table with strangers but if you're open minded it really is a cool vibe and totally worth getting aquinted to new people."
,,,,,I got lucky and was able to get seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen where all the magic happens.  Being able to watch the team put the flavorful plates together was an added bonus to my experience. Voted one of  America's best restaurants in 2010 the Purple Pig exceeded my expectations.  
,,,,,"My party of two ordered the smashed potatoes, octopus a la plancha and the Turkey leg confit. Please note the plates are meant to be shared and OMG it was more than enough food. Let's just say each plate just got better as they came. It was as if my friend and I were making music with our yums and oh's and ah's and wow's of how delicious everything was.  Minimal talking was had as we were too busy stuffing our faces with such deliciousness! "
,,,,,I was still a little hungover from the night before and had a flight to catch so I chose not to have a hair of the dog but they have an extensive wine list that I will absolutely try the next time I'm in town.  I will certainly be back!
,,,,,"If you're looking for delicious reasonably priced food and a good time with awesome service, you must try the Purple Pig. One of my all time favorite restaurants in Chitown."
,,,,,"Great service from their staff! Food was out so quickly and was delicious. Anything you get from here is phenomenal. We ordered the pork shoulder, ham croquettes, octopus, pork belly, broccoli, and salmon!"
,,,,,Food was good. Pastas were my favorite but the duck was a close second. Salmon was fine did not stand out. Bone marrow was fine as well but there was a lot of bone. Dishes are probably shareable among 3-4 people but less so among 5-6. Interesting diner type vibe which I understand is different than before they moved. Lots of hard surfaces which made things seem a little loud. Good observance of COVID precautions though it was cumbersome to put on our masks mid meal for the server to bring each of our 10 courses.
,,,,,"If you're in Chicago, you really need to stop by. They don't take reservations so plan ahead. The food they serve here is quite the experience! Everything we ordered was amazing. Everyone at the tables next to us looked like they all were enjoying their food as well! (The tables are quite tight here)."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"It's so easy to miss this place because it's kinda tucked in from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave), but it's so good! "
,,,,,"Based on all the reviews on Yelp, it seems like there's always a long wait. However, I lucked out and only had to wait 15 minutes on Lolapalooza Sunday (around 5:30PM!!) I saw that they had a post-it note estimating how long the wait would be based on what time of day it is, so don't give up when the host tells you that the wait is super long! Be patient, and walk around magnificent mile while you're at it! "
,,,,,"My party of 6 got sat down 15 minutes after we signed in, and we were seated at the high top communal style table. It was pretty crammed, but not going to complain since we barely had to wait. The waitress was very nice and talked us through the menu, WHICH CHANGES TWICE DAILY (according to her anyway)!! So don't be surprised if you see something on Yelp that you want to try, but isn't on the menu :3"
,,,,,"The 6 of us shared an octopus asparagus dish, duck confit, pork malnati, a pasta dish, and the bone marrow. The bone marrow and the duck were to die for!! The bone marrow wasn't too oily, and it wasn't overcooked. The duck was juicy and tender as if it would melt in your mouth! The octopus wasn't chewy at all, and everything tasted great. "
,,,,,"I'm so glad I got to check this place out while I was at Chicago, and this place definitely lived up to its expectations. 10/10 would recommend!"
,,,,,"The purple pig was such a interesting place and I was glad to be able to try it. The crispy pig's ear was indeed crispy and after I took the picture I sliced the yolk open and mixed it with the pigs ear and kale. To be honest my favorite thing about this dish surprisingly was the kale and I'm not a huge veggie guy. The bone marrow was cool to eat because you get a piece of bread, add a little bone marrow on and spread it around the bread then add a pinch of salt that they provide you and a few herbs on top. I could probably do without the capers that they provide for this dish, but make sure to add some of the greens to cut out the fat from the bone marrow. The chicken thigh kebabs were huge and served with a tzatziki sauce. I thought the skin on top was too salty for me. The fried smash potatoes on the bottom of the kebabs were delicious though. I like the idea of what this place is trying to do and I would honestly come back and try other things they have to offer!"
,,,,,"The best. Must come here if you're visiting. My second time in Chicago, which means it was my second time at the purple pig. "
,,,,,"The pork neck bone gravy is rich, flavorful, and comforting. The pig platter is also a great choice! A good variety and esthetically playing. Also... Best broccoli ever... The sauce is creamy and tangy. "
,,,,,I can't wait to come here again the next time I visit to Chicago!
,,,,,"So I'll start by saying the restaurant was super busy.. We were told 20-40 minutes wait for a table which was accurate. We sat outside and were offered a beverage menu, that was a nice amenity."
,,,,,We were seated and our server was nice and engaged. We ordered our food and didn't have to wait long for the cheese platter!
,,,,,"Promptly after, our first shareable entree (half duck) arrived. It was so good!!! At first I didn't think it was plated attractively, but that's because there was a yogurt sauce that blended in with the plate so it looked like the duck was off center. The yogurt balanced out the sweetness of the duck skin. I didn't partake any of the roe."
,,,,,"We asked that the second entree be cancelled since it never came out..We were told that luckily another table ordered the lamb ribs so they could give the dish to them instead. My concern was that, the timelines of the dish was not communicated to us beforehand. I don't know if it takes longer to prepare or if it was never put in, or if there was a mistake in the kitchen.. It just seemed like had the other table not ordered it, we would be charged for a dish that came out 30 minutes after the other two plates.. "
,,,,,"We ordered dessert- a chocolate, lime +matcha, banana bombe and a Sicilian Iris. They were both mediocre. The lime was too strong and the Sicilian Iris had an excellent exterior texture..but the inside was undercooked..I don't know if it was the dough or the cheese..but there was something stringy in the filing. "
,,,,,"I would go again to try the other entrees on the menu, just not for the desserts!"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was the restaurant I was most excited about coming to Chicago. I absolutely love tapas/small plates restaurant, all the more reason to overeat delicious foods!"
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I got here at around 4:50 pm on a Sunday evening before a Second City Show, and there was no wait. We got seated at the end of a communal table. Our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and efficient. She came over and took our drink orders and then answered a couple of questions we had about the menu. We ordered The Pig Platter, the salt and vinegar fried beef tendon chips, the bone marrow, the octopus, and the pork jowl. "
,,,,,The Pig Platter: I loved all the different meats and the pickled veggies it came with. The pickles were delicious and went so well with the meat. I loved it!
,,,,,"Salt and Vinegar Fried Beef Tendon Chips: It was salty, fried goodness. My boyfriend LOVED it. It was good, but I also felt like I was gaining .5 lbs with every bite."
,,,,,"Roasted Bone Marrow: One of my favorite dishes. It was prepared perfectly, and I loved the bread it came with. It was toasted, buttered, and too delicious. The greens that came with it was a great complement to the rich bone marrow. "
,,,,,"Octopus: When it first came out, it looked like sausage, but damn was it good. The pesto had great flavor, I was a huge fan. The potatoes and the green beans were delicious."
,,,,,"Pork Jowl: Our favorite dish. The pork was tender, salty, and so good. We loved the sunny side egg on top, the runny yolk was a great sauce to the salty pork."
,,,,,"Some of the dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but nothing the garnishes couldn't help with. Yum. We also decided on getting dessert (even though we didn't need it, but we were on vacation...) He got the affogato and I got the caramel poached pear dessert. We are huge desserts people. He loved the affogato (I'm not a coffee person at all), the poached pear was STUNNING. It looked gorgeous and tasted delicious. I definitely did not need to eat most of it, but that didn't stop me. I love the flavor of the poached pears, and the ice cream was a delicious nice touch. "
,,,,,"It is communal seating, but that just means you get to check out what everyone else is eating and start some friendly conversations (aka get some awesome recommendations!). Everything was prepared well, service was AWESOME, and it's a fun atmosphere. I can't wait to come back here!"
,,,,,"Amazing food! It's tapas style and meant to share. I don't think they take reservations but we went Sunday ~2pm and there were a few available tables. We had the crispy pig ears which was absolutely delicious! The peppers provided a nice tangy acid that complemented the fried ears. It pretty much tasted like crispy bits of meat! Delicious! We also had the cauliflower with cornichons which was probably the best tasting cauliflower I've ever had! The octopus was good, delicious, soft but maybe a bit oily from the sauce. The gnocchi was amazing. This was not vegetarian since the ragú sauce had meat in it. This was rich and delicious. To end, we had the loukem...... not sure how to spell it but the Greek fried dough with honey. Best donuts. Better than beignets ;-)"
,,,,,Overall I recommend coming here. It's a great place to have wine and tapas and be a little adventurous!
,,,,,"What a wonderful meal we had at The Purple Pig.  We waited at the bar and managed to get a couple of seats in about 20 minutes.  The service was outstanding, even as we were waiting a couple of servers took our drink orders and gave us some olives to munch on.   The menu is so interesting and each item has a recommended wine to go with the meal.  The wine list is so large, I heard over 500 types of wine and very interesting and fairly price.  Congrats to the Beverage Manager.  While we were ordering, we met the Alan the Beverage Manager and received some great ideas on wine to have with our order.  What did we eat?  We had the Salt-Roasted Beet that come with Whipped Goat Cheese + Pistachio Butter and the Lamb Ribs.  Both were terrific in taste, presentation and combination of flavors.  Don't miss desert.  We had the Sicilian Iris that I was told they are know for; a roll full of ricotta cheese and dark chocolate that is baked and melts in you mouth."
,,,,,We met a few people at the bar and had a great time getting to know them and get other recommendations on things to do and places to eat in Chicago.  The meal and people just made it a wonderful experience.
,,,,,Not so fast! 
,,,,,"Before reviewing The Purple Pig, let's have some pig poetry, shall we, just to get into the mood? It's also likely that you'll be waiting a long time for a table, so I'm sure you won't mind reading this to pass the time. "
,,,,,The Pig
,,,,,BY ROALD DAHL
,,,,,In England once there lived a big
,,,,,And wonderfully clever pig.
,,,,,To everybody it was plain
,,,,,That Piggy had a massive brain.
,,,,,"He worked out sums inside his head,"
,,,,,"There was no book he hadn't read,"
,,,,,"He knew what made an airplane fly,"
,,,,,He knew how engines worked and why.
,,,,,"He knew all this, but in the end"
,,,,,One question drove him round the bend:
,,,,,He simply couldn't puzzle out
,,,,,What LIFE was really all about.
,,,,,What was the reason for his birth?
,,,,,Why was he placed upon this earth?
,,,,,His giant brain went round and round.
,,,,,"Alas, no answer could be found,"
,,,,,"Till suddenly one wondrous night,"
,,,,,"All in a flash, he saw the light."
,,,,,He jumped up like a ballet dancer
,,,,,"And yelled, ""By gum, I've got the answer!"""
,,,,,"""They want my bacon slice by slice"
,,,,,"""To sell at a tremendous price!"
,,,,,"""They want my tender juicy chops"
,,,,,"""To put in all the butchers' shops!"
,,,,,"""They want my pork to make a roast"
,,,,,"""And that's the part'll cost the most!"
,,,,,"""They want my sausages in strings!"
,,,,,"""They even want my chitterlings!"
,,,,,"""The butcher's shop! The carving knife!"
,,,,,"""That is the reason for my life!"""
,,,,,Such thoughts as these are not designed
,,,,,To give a pig great peace of mind.
,,,,,"Next morning, in comes Farmer Bland,"
,,,,,"A pail of pigswill in his hand,"
,,,,,"And Piggy with a mighty roar,"
,,,,,Bashes the farmer to the floor . . .
,,,,,Now comes the rather grizzly bit
,,,,,"So let's not make too much of it,"
,,,,,Except that you must understand
,,,,,"That Piggy did eat Farmer Bland,"
,,,,,"He ate him up from head to toe,"
,,,,,Chewing the pieces nice and slow.
,,,,,"It took an hour to reach the feet,"
,,,,,"Because there was so much to eat,"
,,,,,"And when he'd finished, Pig, of course,"
,,,,,Felt absolutely no remorse.
,,,,,Slowly he scratched his brainy head
,,,,,"And with a little smile, he said,"
,,,,,"""I had a fairly powerful hunch"
,,,,,"""That he might have me for his lunch."
,,,,,"""And so, because I feared the worst,"
,,,,,"""I thought I'd better eat him first."""
,,,,,"So how was the Purple Pig? Delicious. We had the eggplant, octopus, broccoli and lamb ribs. Eggplant and octopus were the best. Many good wines by the glass too. Red and white Lambrusco? That's ridiculous but wonderful. "
,,,,,"There were many tourists here and that reputation wrongly kept us a way for a long time, but it's busy for a reason. It was very good!"
,,,,,Came here for a quick bite and drink after we had already eaten dinner.  I couldn't leave Chicago without trying it once.  
,,,,,-Roasted beets were good.  
,,,,,-Duck prosciutto was so good but they give you so little!
,,,,,-I can't remember what cheese we got but I asked for something that would be the most similar in consistency and taste as gouda.  I really liked what he chose for me!
,,,,,"We were too full for food but I'm glad we still got to try it.  If you only have time for one thing Purple Pig or Girl&the Goat, go to Girl&the Goat."
,,,,,"My favorite Restaurant of all time!    Love you all, you are going to make it through this Mess.  I would suggest doing at home, delivery, I will have all my friends on board"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Wow! This place is good. It's also super busy, even on a Wednesday night. "
,,,,,"I am often in Chicago and love this city for so many reasons, especially its terrific food scene. We were staying at the Intercontinental right across the street, which I highly recommend. I've heard a lot about Purple Pig but haven't made it to the restaurant before now. A few things you should know:"
,,,,,"They don't take reservations, so it's first come, first served. Be prepared to wait. "
,,,,,Waiting for a table isn't bad because you can grab a drink and enjoy it in their patio area. 
,,,,,"They have an extensive wine list, so if you're a wine drinker, you will have lots of options. But note that their wines are pricey by the glass, so if a few of you are having wine, just share a bottle. "
,,,,,"Okay, back to the review. We arrived around 7 and put our name on the list. They take your phone number so they can text you when the table is ready. They give you a 10-minute window to get to the restaurant, so you could check in and then visit some local stores. We were just starting a second glass of wine and beer when they texted. We headed to the host stand and while we waiting in line to get our table, a woman went to the front of the line and was very rude to everyone. She was clearly angry and was saying she was in line before everyone and we all cut the line. The host handled it perfectly, telling her that she would help the folks in line then would assist her. I hope she was embarrassed because she made an a$$ of herself. "
,,,,,"We were at a two-top table and were quickly greeted by our server, who explained the menu and made some recommendations. Their menu has so many great options!  We opted for a variety of dishes to share, including chorizo-stuffed olives, deep-fried egg, fava bean purée, crispy pigs ears, secreto (smoked pork dish), and lamb and pork kefedes."
,,,,,"Everything was great!  Little touches elevated each dish...pickled okra with the fried deviled egg, microgreens with the chorizo-stuffed olives, cayenne in the kale with the pigs ears...I'm making myself hungry!  "
,,,,,"If you haven't tried the Purple Pig, go now! You will have an awesome, memorable and crave-worthy meal."
,,,,,"In the 5 nights that we stayed in Chicago, Purple Pig was by far our favorite meal! We got seated right away at a community table. Neither of us have any problems sitting with others and we angled our chairs to keep to ourselves anyways. "
,,,,,"We started our meal with some local beers and the olive appetizer. Oh, em, gee. The olives were warmed/charred with shaved celery, a mustard type sauce and grilled bread. We both were just in awe of how delicious these olives were. We knew right away we were going to love everything on the menu. We had such a hard time choosing what we wanted next. The octopus, the panini, the cheese boards all sounded so heavenly."
,,,,,"We ended up going with creating our own charcuterie plate. We opted for a smoked goat cheese, a sharp cheddar, and then we let the waiter pick our third. We got two meats that included duck prosciutto & air cured beef. It came with a few accompaniments like olives, and spreads. We both loved it and it was the perfect portion for the two of us to share. I think we could have sat here and ate all night trying everything on the menu but we had plans that we had to get to. "
,,,,,"Yes it is pricey, but the food quality is worth the price you are paying. The wait staff was friendly, helpful, and quick. I was in love with this place."
,,,,,"If you're into trying never before seen dishes then this is the place for you. There is usually a long wait, but you can bypass that by going to the bar and ordering food there. I enjoyed the food and I'm a  picky eater."
,,,,,"Definitely a great experience.  We were visiting Chicago and this place was highly recommended and I can fully understand why.  The place was very busy when we got there with no reservation but we were seated immediately at a shared high top.  The service was great, even with a crazy crowd."
,,,,,"The food was nothing short of amazing.  We ordered the bone marrow, scallion garganelli (chicken bolognese), grilled octopus and affogato for dessert.  Every single plate was practically licked clean.  Since we had shared seating, I got a chance to see other patrons choices up close and everything looked mouth watering."
,,,,,Can't wait to come back
,,,,,"Great spot! We stumbled into this establishment around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon and were able to grab seats at the bar. We were lucky as I've been told it gets really packed here and it is first come, first serve. As we were leaving, more people were beginning to come in. "
,,,,,Service was awesome. I wish I remember the name of the lady who waited on us at the bar. She was very helpful and gave us great recommendations. We were eye hungry and wanted to order many different plates but she told us to just pick 3 and after those 3 plates if we're still hungry then we can order more and she can get those plates out quickly for us. I'm so glad she told us that because after 3 plates we were STUFFED. It would've been a waste of food had we ordered more. 
,,,,,"Fried pig ears 4/5 - Crispy and yummy. It is definitely a greasy dish so it's easy to get sick of it, but still very good. "
,,,,,"Bone marrow 3/5 - You really can't go wrong with bone marrow, but I didn't like the mixed greens and onions they paired with the bone marrow. The sauce was almost sour so it overpowered the bone marrow. "
,,,,,Braised pork shoulder 4/5 - Yummy! The pork shoulder lays on bed of purée potatoes. The meat just melts in your mouth. 
,,,,,I forgot the name of the drink I had but it is a petty color green(see photo) and it was so refreshing. My boyfriend really enjoyed the beer he had as well. 
,,,,,Overall we had a pleasant experience and would recommend this to anyone!
,,,,,"4 star only because the price is high for the small food. It is highly recommended place by my friends who are in the area. My bf does not like pretentious food, but I brought him and my brother here and they thought it was phenomenal! "
,,,,,Roasted bone marrow 5/5 it was so buttery and melted in your mouth.
,,,,,"Crispy Pig ears 5/5  $15 worth EVERY PENNY, the fried egg really made it."
,,,,,Chicken Thigh Kebabs 5/5 
,,,,,Housemade Meatballs 4/5 it was like any other meatballs
,,,,,"They are small tapas so it is great place to share multiple plates, seating is very small, we went here on a saturday evening and it was packed, the wait was about 45-1 hour, we walked around and got drinks at some bar. I highly recommend this place the wait is definitely worth it!"
,,,,,"Amazing dining experience. Seating is first come first serve. I was solo on a work trip, and even on Valentine's Day, I did not have to wait for a table and was seated right away. Josie was my server. She was hospitable, well informed. She gave fantastic service and fantastic recommendations. I love tapas, but am often left wanting more. This WAS NOT the case here. Portions were extremely generous for the style. The only downside to this was I was hoping to taste several more things, but I was stuffed! I asked for a dry acidic white wine and Josie recommended the Albariño, which was fantastic. I am not capturing the full names of menu items, but I had the tongue, the artichoke, and the Spanish octopus. It's hard to choose a favorite, but I think it'd choose the tongue. Each dish has a rich flavor profile and was presented beautifully. The Purple Pig served as an excellent dining treat!"
,,,,,"As you can see I have been here several times before where I enjoyed my prior lunches. My party of 4 decided to return here again for lunch. Because this place is noted as a tourist trap, I really don't mind being trapped here in this particular restaurant. We knew to arrive here early around 11:30am when they first open because there is always a line outside to enter this restaurant for lunch. We waited inside the adjacent office building. We were seated almost immediately again in the adjacent tented area."
,,,,,I started and enjoyed my rebel scum cocktail for $13 and my speckled hen draft beer for $8. A 8 ounce glass of Tasca Leone is an expensive $19 each. My guests enjoyed 4 of those glasses. 
,,,,,"My #1 favorite shared plates here is the Saganaki seafood for $22, (which I enjoyed last time). This time we also enjoyed the shared Caesar salad for $10 and the calamari for $14. I felt the pizza for $14, bavette steak for $20 and meetballs for $13 were not as unique or as tasty. We all felt the saltimbocca for $16 was tough and our least favorite shared plate. The four of us agreed."
,,,,,Heriberto served our table needs well. My total bill was $244 less gratuities. We will definitely return here again for some more of our favorite shared lunch plates.
,,,,,"This place was highly rated on Yelp. It was my first visit here for lunch. I did not have a reservation. The inside was packed with customers, when we arrived around noon time. I was able to get a table for two outside on the side of the restaurant, which was covered and shielded with clear plastic from the elements and well heated. "
,,,,,"We shared the calamari for $10 to start, which was tasty. I also enjoyed my seafood Saganaki with shrimp, mussels, sepia, striped bass, tomato and feta cheese for $22. I also ordered a bottle of their #140 Sicilian 2015 Tasca d' Almerta, Leone for $46."
,,,,,"Jake served our table needs nicely. My total bill exclusive of gratuities was $108. We both enjoyed our lunch and service. As a result I returned here a second time with my larger family party of four, which was just as enjoyable as my first visit. I will definitely return here again for lunch. This review is mostly based on my first visit, but, I was just as satisfied with my second family of four visit for lunch."
,,,,,This place is pretty good i tend to bring my guests or friends who visit here for a consistently above average meal. I will always suggest the 
,,,,,- bone marrow
,,,,,- Spanish octopus
,,,,,- pork jowl 
,,,,,Ive heard their vegetable dishes are also very good but i have yet to try.. because i would rather eat more bone marrow!
,,,,,You can not go wrong with any of their offerings.  Every plate my GF and I ordered was delish.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,This place is awesome. The only thing I can saw is to get there before 6pm if you don't want to wait an hour and a half to get seated.
,,,,,I'm not usually the type to like Tapas or small dishes but I loved The Purple Pig. The whipped fetta cheese dish was amazing and the bone marrow was delicious. I highly recommend getting either or both. 
,,,,,It's a very lively place and has good ambiance.
,,,,,"The server suggested 3 dishes for 2 people.  Clearly you underestimate our eating abilities. We ordered 6: octopus, bone marrow, Berkshire shoulder, broccoli, goat cheese with honey and the lemon bar.  "
,,,,,"The two best dishes were easily the broccoli (I know, right?!) and the octopus, which was not only crazy tender, but had the most perfect char  on it.  Honestly, those two dishes alone would be enough for me to re-visit.  The broccoli had this addicting sauce that coated every inch of it and it was just as good as Girl and the Goat's broccoli. Vegetables really stepped up their game lately."
,,,,,"The only criticism is that the restaurant was a little too loud for me to hear my friend comfortably.  And because it's on Michigan avenue, it's also extremely busy, even for a Thursday evening.  We ended up having a slight mix-up with one of our dishes and didn't get it until much later.  But it was the octopus dish and well worth the wait!"
,,,,,This place was yet another example of good food but bad service.   I was so excited to come here given the sheer amount of reviews and news articles I've read.  And while the food was actually pretty good I did not like the service. 
,,,,,First we sat at the table for quite some time without being greeted by the server.   I mean long enough that we knew exactly what we wanted by the time the server came and we were debating over the menu. 
,,,,,Second she gave us her speech about the restaurant and the way you should order which is fine but you could tell it was rehearsed and not genuine especially when you hear it exactly the same verbatim at 2 other tables.   She also definitely had a smile but wasn't smiling with her eyes and the moment she was done speaking she would looked upset or like she she didn't like us or was annoyed by us. 
,,,,,"We also almost never saw her again.   When I asked her for salt she rolled her eyes at me!   However,  the sever assistants"
,,,,,This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Everything we ordered tasted amazing!
,,,,,"I definitely recommend the pork blade steak. The meat was so juicy and tender. It literally melted in my mouth! We also got the bone marrow dish. It was my first time trying bone marrow and I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a small portion, but it was the perfect appetizer. It also comes with bread that you eat it together with."
,,,,,"The third dish we got was smashed potatoes. I was expecting something like mashed potatoes, but it was the actual potatoes with skin on it. It still tastes good and it went well with the steak. "
,,,,,We went around 4pm on a Sunday and got seated right away. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and I would go back to Chicago just to eat at this restaurant again!
,,,,,"I was quite surprised that we scored a table on the patio right away on Monday afternoon. I came here a few years ago when I first visited Chicago so I was excited to be back. We skipped the cured meats and pork dishes this time around since we wanted a lighter lunch but it's a must if you are a first timer. We decided on the calamari, grilled octopus, and pig's ear. "
,,,,,"- Calamari: very refreshing, more of a salad type dish. I really like the fregola and the pistachios added a nice texture."
,,,,,- Grilled octopus: perfection! the octopus was very tender and the salsa verde had great flavors.
,,,,,"- Pig's ear: it was a bit oily and too salty for me. It came with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and a fried egg on top. The pickled peppers did help tone some of the saltiness down."
,,,,,"They have a great wine list and food here is excellent. Like everyone has already mentioned, be prepared for a wait if you coming during the evening but it's definitely worth a visit!"
,,,,,"Oh yes, the famous Purple Pig that's oinking up patrons in the heart of Chicago among high rises and a lengthy river. Was it everything and more? Certainly!"
,,,,,"As one of then city's staples, Purple Pig is one of the more affordable options comparatively, but it'll still leave a dent in your wallet. Thus, best practice is to come with a small group of friends (4-6 people) and agree on splitting all the items so that everyone can have a piece of the goodness. We came on a Saturday morning right as they opened and managed to snag a table within a couple of minutes."
,,,,,Some of our highlights:
,,,,,- Duck Pate ($12) was very impressive! Smooth and buttery with just the right amount of saltiness spread over some toasted bread. Definitely one of the best pate's that I've had.
,,,,,- Octopus ($17) was killer delicious. Charbroiled to perfection and not overly chewy. This was my kind of seafood
,,,,,- Roasted Bone Marrow ($15) came with two cuts of fatty bone innards. Also accompanied with toast.
,,,,,- Tom & Jerry Steak ($25) was arguably the best bang for your buck. Plate was full of flavor and enough portions to get everyone on the table filled up and ready to go.
,,,,,"Everything that we had was delicious and certainly an experience. I wouldn't come here all the time but if you have friends willing to get together for a great casual but upscale dining experience, squeal on over here."
,,,,,The wait is finally over! We finally got a chance to dine at this wildly popular restaurant in Chicago. It was definitely a good experience but personally I don't think it's a five-star experience.
,,,,,"Being a typical tourist, I practically ordered everything that were recommended and most popular. We started with the beef tendon chips and some rose sangria. The chips were crunchy and savory; rose sangria was refreshing and perfect sweetness. Truly 5-star experience and great for Happy Hour. "
,,,,,"Then we had the pig's ear and Pork Jowl JLT sandwich. Though the ingredients and names are interesting and creative, we didn't the food lived up to the expectations. 3 stars."
,,,,,"Lastly, we had the grilled octopus and it was quite good! The octopus was tender and juicy... Probably best entree out of everything we ordered that night. We also wanted to get dessert but none of the options on Yelp was available then."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig is always busy and with good reason.  The drinks are tasty, the servers are knowledgeable, the atmosphere is lively, and the food is crafted with care; even if it's heavy on the salt and sugar for my palate. You'll want to come with a small group as the menu is designed to be shared.  "
,,,,,"You had me at hello--beets, goat cheese and pistachios are favs of mine, so I definitely enjoyed the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter.  The beets were tender, and the tangy creaminess from the goat cheese paired with the nuttiness of the pistachios was great.  "
,,,,,"If you ever thought broccoli was boring, the roasted broccoli with toasted bread crumbs and anchovy vinaigrette will change your mind.  The roasting add great texture to the broccoli, the breadcrumbs added a slight crunch, and the anchovies put it over the top with a salty umami flavor."
,,,,,"For a larger plate, the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes is a top seller.  The pork has been cooked until it's fork tender.  The potatoes have been passed through a ricer for the ultimate smooth, light texture, and the gravy is salty and rich."
,,,,,"If you have a serious sweet tooth, the sticky date cake with orange frozen yogurt is for you.  The moist cake is covered with a very sweet pistachio butter, bites of pistachio sugar candy and tangy orange frozen yogurt.  "
,,,,,"The Purple Pig has bar seating, regular tables and communal tables.  Go with good company, be patient with the wait time, and enjoy!"
,,,,,"Let me preface this by saying that I came for breakfast, so I can only speak to that."
,,,,,"You go inside and order at the register and then find a table and they bring you your food. I asked for a cappuccino, and ordered the French toast with berries and pecans. Deliciousness!! My mom ordered eggs and avocado and a parfait. My cousin ordered a parfait and a latte. My aunt custom ordered eggs and veggies. Everyone loved their meals and coffee! "
,,,,,Great place for a casual but filling breakfast!
,,,,,"As visitors to Chicago, this place was on our list but we were nervous about the no reservations set up. We decided to try a late afternoon time and were rewarded by a short wait! Our small group was shown to our ""assigned seats"" at the communal tables and we started to review a menu that everything sounded tasty. With the help of our neighboring diners and the knowledgeable servers, we started our selecting our items."
,,,,,"We started with the recommended roasted bone marrow with an herb salad. We were provided 4 pieces of crusty bread. The bone was large and we used our provided bread quickly and were soon offered more which we happily accepted. The herb salad was perfectly seasoned with a  light, tangy dressing which perfectly complimented the marrow. "
,,,,,Then we moved on to the Ricotta Gnocchi with neck bone gravy. The light fluffy Gnocchi was a favorite dish. Grilled broccoli and Octopus a la plancha rounded out of feast of favorites. 
,,,,,One dish which wasn't a favorite was the eggplant caponata with goat cheese. This is usually a favorite dish of mine but this version was a little sweet for my preference.
,,,,,The Purple pig has a nice selection of wines and beer. Be prepared to wait if arrive during the dinner hour and get ready to share your table with some new friends!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"This spot is amazing! A friend had been before and made us a reservation, I wouldn't otherwise have ever known about this place as it's located inside a larger building off Michigan Ave! A great place to grab lunch or dinner while you shop. The purple pig has Mediterranean small plates - we tried the whipped feta (incredible), corn salad, anchovy bread crumb broccoli (wow!), and salmon and pork tenderloin dishes. Everything was so great! And with those 5 dishes us 5 girls were full! The staff was super friendly and were very cautious with health and safety during these COVID times! I would recommend this place to anyone!"
,,,,,An extremely popular restaurant on Miracle Mile!
,,,,,They do not take reservations.  I recommend coming on a weekday because I can imagine the wait on the weekend to be horrendous!  We dined on a Monday night & waited 45 minutes. 
,,,,,"Friendly customer service & good food.  They have indoor or covered patio seating & the patio was nice because we got a warm, summer breeze."
,,,,,They recommend getting 2 dishes per person because their dishes are tapas styles.
,,,,,"3 cheeses:  We love Brie cheese & our server recommended 3 very light, delicious cheeses.  They were served with crackers & a variety of jams."
,,,,,Roasted Bone Marrow:  I typically shy away from bone marrow but this was delicious.  Salty & creamy.
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder:  We opted out of getting another dish because we saw how large this dish was.  We could not even finish it!  The meat was juicy & tender.
,,,,,"Once in awhile you find food nirvana. This place was recommended by a foodie friend and I only wish I'd come here with more people because I wanted to try everything!  To make matters worse, I sat at the pass bar and watched, in wonder at the symphony of movement and timing as five quick as lightning staff members, under the baton of the lead, moved deftly to compose each plate. One seasoning, handing it off to the grilled, another checking each bone of marrow, as another painted flavor and color across a plate. A final inspection by the lead just as a server swept by to take it to an eagerly awaiting patron. Each dish, more tempting than the last. Each person, more impressive in organization, skill and presentation. I highly recommend. Bring friends, order everything, and enjoy!"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig restaurant is reason enough on its own to visit Chicago. We're from Los Angeles but find ourselves in Chicago once a year for a couple nights ahead of a nearby conference we attend. We discovered the Purple Pig by accident during our first visit when we attempted to visit a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant across the street that happened to be closed for remodeling. ""The Purple Pig"" sign across the street was inviting...""Let's see what's over there"" I said to my wife after it became a reality that we wouldn't be eating at a wine, cheese and chocolate restaurant. We have returned every year and The Purple Pig has become the one given thing that we will do on every visit to Chicago."
,,,,,"On this particular visit, everything that came out of the kitchen looked gorgeous, like super artsy yummy comfort food, and the looks of joy on people's faces when their food arrived at their tables were pretty universal."
,,,,,"They have extensive wine, beer, aperitifs, liqueurs and cocktails (classic and house) menus. I had the Green Acres cocktail (egg white, chocolate bitters, tequila.) It had extraordinary texture and was very well mixed."
,,,,,"I also opted for ""3 cheeses"". These folks really know what they're doing with cheese. I don't remember all three that I had, but I'm fairly confident that from now on, if it's not the 10 Year Old Cheddar, they served me, it's not as good as it can get."
,,,,,"One dessert item we didn't order, but which we saw walk by several times was the ""Sicilian Iris"" was a brioche ball with ricotta and chocolate chips, covered with powdered sugar. It looked like it would kill you dead with its awesomeness. Some day Purple Pig...some day."
,,,,,"There are many options for vegetarians, and drinkers, and people who just love food in general."
,,,,,"The place is also always super crowded...at least the five times we've stopped in over the last several years. But we've never actually had to wait for a table despite this...just lucky, or maybe most people waiting were standing by for outdoor seating."
,,,,,"On a side note, years after we first visited The Purple Pig, we discovered it on a list of America's ten best restaurants. What an incredibly happy accident discovering this place."
,,,,,"I came here a few years ago and remembered how amazing it was. We decided to come back since we were in town, and it's just as good as I remembered!"
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow, which was delicious. Comes with toasted bread and an acidic herb salad. There's also salt to season yourself. The combination is amazing. We also had the octopus, which was super tender. The best part of the meal was probably the milk marinated short rib. It's creamy on the inside, and it completely falls apart when you stab into it with your fork. "
,,,,,"Everything here is rich and flavorful. The only downside is that everything seems a little fatty and heavy. But if you don't mind gaining a little weight, it's worth it!!"
,,,,,I came here with 5 of my friends to have dinner on Wednesday night. We went during a busy hour (around 7pm) and they were fully packed. We had to wait for over an hour and a half (which the host told us about as soon as we put our name on the waiting list). I think the wait will be shorter if you come with a smaller party. 
,,,,,"Overall, I had a great time! The waiter and the staffs were very nice and came by several time to ask if we needed anything throughout the night. I ordered the Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder for dinner. I was expecting a small portion since the waiter told us that two entrées will fill up one person. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the size of the pork. It was juicy and melted in your mouth! I loved every bit of it. However, I do wish there was a bit more potatoes and less salt on the pork. For dessert, I ordered their chocolate cake and it was very rich and the sauce that came with it was a bit sour. If are thinking about getting this for dessert, I highly recommend some coffee, tea, or red wine to go along with it."
,,,,,Not even sure how I knew about this place but it's just one of those places that everyone seems to need to try and I'm very glad I did. Came on a Tuesday for a late lunch and the place was still pretty full. Luckily I was dining alone so I immediately got a seat at the bar right in front of the kitchen action. Service was very polite and attentive the entire time.
,,,,,I got 3 items for my lunch:
,,,,,-Manchester cheese w/ fig jam: This was a spreadable double cream cow's milk cheese recommended by my waiter and it was absolutely delicious. It paired well with the fig jam but I could easily eat it alone. It was almost like a creamy cheese fudge. Absolutely would get this again or try one of their other cheese options (5/5)
,,,,,-Burrata Cannoli: The cannoli by itself was a bit bland and getting the various garnishes and sauces on it is quite the task but when you do get it all together it creates a tasty bite with a variety of textures & flavors. The burrata is whipped I believe so it was very fluffy and light. The dish only comes with two medium sized cannolis so it's definitely not a filling appetizer and its a bit pricy for the amount you receive. (4/5)
,,,,,"-Ricotta stuffed gnocchi w/ rabbit ragu & nettle pesto: Gnocchi is always a hit or miss dish for me but for the first time this is somewhere in the middle. I would've loved a different textural element because the whole dish was just kind of soft. However the flavors for the most part were excellent. The creamy, light ricotta paired very well with the slightly gamey rabbit ragu and the nettle pesto gave everything a delicious tanginess. That being said I did find the ragu just a bit too salty and I would've loved a bit more of the pesto (3.5/5)"
,,,,,"Overall, the dishes here have been unique and delicious and I definitely would consider returning."
,,,,,"Came here for a birthday celebration and really enjoyed it. For me, 5 stars requires every item to be delicious and worthy of its price point, and the Purple Pig delivers. Everything is thoughtful and creative. The dishes are flavorful, balanced, and elegant. We ordered the smoked pork tongue, roasted bone marrow, pork jowl, crispy pig ears, and summer green beans. Pork tongue was cooked well, with a good bite but still quite tender. I'm a sucker for bone marrow, and this was well balanced with tossed herbs/capers on the accompanying bread. Crispy pig ears were delightful and crispy. The only complaint I had about these was that the pig ears were cut so thing that the pig ears themselves tasted mostly like breading. However, the overall dish was absolutely delicious with the fried kale, pickled peppers, and egg. Green beans were really interesting with hazelnuts, peach, and basil. This somehow all worked, although not sure I'd get it again. The pork jowl was messy and difficult to eat but tasted quite good."
,,,,,"I also really like this place because of its commitment to high quality food. On my previous visit, the chef wasn't satisfied with the cook on a plate of bone marrow for another table and a server asked if we wanted it for no charge. I couldn't believe it because even the rejected bone marrow was SO good. "
,,,,,Definitely worth a visit!
,,,,,"So glad we came! Heriberto took good care of us. He was very attentive, he had great suggestions for food and desserts, and he one when to bring stuff out since we ordered around 11 plates or so. We were really happy he took the time to chat with us, despite it being super busy on a Friday night."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"We had lots: Beef Bavette, Duck prosciutto, prosciutto de Parma, grilled broccoli (the sauce is to die for! It's no anchovy-ish at all I think), manchego cheese(The cheese itself was amazing but the sauce is a little on the sweet relish side) "
,,,,,The standouts:  
,,,,,Pork Shoulder- holy *%#]}{* that was good. Like really good comfort food. Fall off the bone tender. Wonderfully made with Gravy and mashed potatoes and these little crunchy things on top that were just perfect. 
,,,,,"Turkey leg confit: I don't know because my husband ate it like a Flintstone.  For the young people, I mean it was huge turkey leg that is probably meant for 2-3 people but he just sat there happily eating like that old cartoon... anyhow! The sauce. It was magic. "
,,,,,Octopus ala Plancha-grilled octopus Oh so good. It's so smooth and the sauce is what makes it. 
,,,,,Bone Marrow- Bread with a dash of sea salt and the most deliciously dressed cilantro was KILLER! 
,,,,,Desserts: 
,,,,,Get the Bone Marrow Pound Cake. So good! Doesn't taste like marrow -and it's honestly one of the best pounds cakes I have ever had.
,,,,,Oh man. What can I say about Purple Pig that hasn't been said before?? This was hands down my favorite meal in Chicago! I liked it a lot more than the other super popular restaurant in Chicago with over 6000 reviews. 
,,,,,"All the dishes are served tapas style with a Mediterranean flare, so try to come with at least 3-4 people! They recommend about 2 dish per person and that was more than enough for us. The seating here is a bit strange though. We got seated at a communal table outside but instead of having us sit 2 on each side facing each other, we had 2 on one side, 1 at the head, and 1 on the other side. That made talking to each other a bit awkward."
,,,,,"The service here is phenomenal. The servers were very friendly, personable and attentive. Additionally, when my friend forgot her credit card at the restaurant, they called us less than 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant."
,,,,,"We ordered the chicken kebabs, braised pork shoulder, razor clams, pig ears, beets with goat cheese, and cured meat platter. Everything was super delicious and I would not mind reordering it again. Other than the food being slightly saltier for some dishes, I had no complaints. "
,,,,,I would definitely come back here if I'm ever in Chicago!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"I came here for a dinner with my team, after wanting to try this place for years. I finally made it! We shared a bunch of plates and everything they made was delicious. The sauces honestly make half the dishes here."
,,,,,"That being said, the below rankings are mostly for future me to reference when I go back."
,,,,,Would Not Hesitate to Order Again:
,,,,,"1) Pork Shoulder: I blinked, and then it was gone like a dream. That's how quickly it melted in my mouth."
,,,,,2) Roasted Bone Marrow: beautifully flavored and well accompanied with capers & greens
,,,,,3) Grilled Broccoli: coated in an amazing tangy sauce
,,,,,Would Consider Again:
,,,,,1) Pork Belly (w/ Ginger Glaze): cut through like butter
,,,,,"2) Scallops: fresh, tender, and served over a delicious creamy orange sauce"
,,,,,3) Fried Brussels Sprouts: the generous drizzle of lemon juice makes all the difference
,,,,,Slightly Underwhelming:
,,,,,"1) Pigs Feet & Pheasant: good, rich flavors, but small portions"
,,,,,"2) Turkey Leg: it looked impressive on the plate, but otherwise it was just a normal turkey leg. It probably didn't help that Thanksgiving was just a couple weeks ago."
,,,,,"This place was EPIC. We enjoyed the food very much! The presentation was very elegant, to the point where you question whether wearing jeans was suitable. We had three distinct dishes and the next we are in Chicago, we will definitely visit again. Thank you for the great evening!"
,,,,,The Purple Pig is a perfect gathering spot if you can get a table. Seating is first come first serve. The food and service were excellent! 
,,,,,"The seating encourages interaction. The communal tables were perfect for sharing tapas and interacting with your neighbor. We sat at a small table in a corner, next to another couple. The open kitchen allows you to peer into the chef's bustling kitchen. Large amounts of natural light illuminates the clean lines and marble tables. "
,,,,,The roasted bone marrow ($16) came in such generous portions! Two bone marrow on a platter. I loved the pickled cilantro and fennel that went with this dish. The bone marrow was a little bland but the salad and salt helped a lot. The sheer amount for the price was worth it! The crunchy toasted brioche bread was delicious!
,,,,,"Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder ($19) was tender, slightly dry but well seasoned. The mashed potatoes and puffed farro were sweet, creamy and delicious. "
,,,,,"The Burrata and Poached Lobster Cannoli ($19) was a great idea! I loved the creamy milky burrata in the thin crispy cannoli. I was a little disappointed that the lobster was scattered around the dish and not incorporated inside the cannoli. The poached lobster was perfectly done, but only had a few pieces. "
,,,,,"Overall, the food was great! The waitress was very friendly. I would definitely come back to try more items on the menu!"
,,,,,They did a great job. Went there for brunch without a reservation and was lucky enough to get a seat quickly. Loved the ambiance and the food was delicious. Highly recommend the truffle sausage and French omelette. Would definitely go back for dinner. They do have a revolving menu.
,,,,,"What  fresh and delicious food! Plenty of unique options while still offering classics that we grew up loving such as a nice juicy pork chop with melted butter. The food is very tasty, and I really can't think of any issues. It's awesome, ill be returning very soon!"
,,,,,"My first stop after landing in Chicago and checking into my hotel. All my fellow Yelpers had raved about this place and it was even mentioned in a food magazine left in my hotel room. The place was kind of hard to find - my Uber probably dropped me off right in front and I still didn't realize it. The restaurant entrance is a pathway that leads into their patio, which has a door to the host stand. Once you notice the huge sign that says ""THE PURPLE PIG"" it becomes pretty obvious though."
,,,,,"It was quite a busy afternoon when I went in; it was Mother's Day, so I decided to sit at the bar. I started out with a sangria and it was delicious. I knew my meal was going to be on the pricey side, so I had a charcuterie plate with blue cheese and duck proscuitto, as well as a small plate of some type of fried mozzarella. I don't remember what it was called, but it was really good! The one thing I wish is that it was described as a sandwich, not fried cheese. Since I was already getting a cheese plate, it was a heavy meal. "
,,,,,"All in all, the meal was super tasty and unique! I wish I had the opportunity to go back and try more. A bit on the pricey side, but I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
,,,,,"Wow! No reservations taken, so we went early and were seated immediately. Service was amazing, detailed and quick. What an interesting menu!! Our choice - a beef selection - melted in our mouths. Yummy! Highly recommend The Purple Pig."
,,,,,"This restaurant not only has poor customer service but their food also tastes like nothing but salt. There were only a few tables when I came in but it took the server forever to come and take my order. I ordered the chicken for the main dish and it was undercooked but nobody came by to check on us. We had to communicate through the busser the whole time. Eventually, I was told that a new dish would be brought out but what I received was the same dish instead only  it was burnt this time. Please be aware of your customers safety during this pandemic."
,,,,,"Purple Pig sits at a whopping 5000+ reviews, so mine will most definitely be lost. Regardless, I am here to say that Purple Pig is quite a delicious restaurant/bar. Even upon opening, lines can get quite long; so unless you're a party of 2, do expect to wait. There're outdoor seating, bar seating and regular tables to suit all the types of diners."
,,,,,"Purple Pig is a tapas kind of place (so be nice and share) with very unique menu items. The most popular dish to get is the milk braised shoulder, it's very tender and flavorful. Roasted beets were a surprisingly good dish with the pistachio butter being a great complement to the beets. Crispy pig ears were a bit of a disappointment though; they tasted more like fried onions that were oversalted and the kale, egg, and whatever else didn't help with the taste either. To top it all off (or to start it all off), we got a pig platter of cured meats since we love prosciutto or chorizo sausage and the like."
,,,,,"While there were so many more items to order, these prices are nothing to laugh at. Each dish is between $10-30 so budget accordingly, or splurge. Either way, Purple Pig is a great place to stop by once in a while."
,,,,,"Wow. What an amazing culinary experience. My boyfriend surprised me with reservations for our anniversary. Service was a 10 out of 10. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers to our waiter were so warm and welcoming. We had the salt roasted beets which were so flavorful and the goat cheese tasted so fresh. I also recommend the octopus which was cooked perfectly, not too chewy with the right amount of acidity. And of course you have to have pork. The braised pork shoulder is so tender, you don't need a knife. Can't wait to go back to try out more dishes."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Great spot on the river! Unique menu items that are always interesting. Highly recommend!
,,,,,"Really one of those special restaurants that don't come around too often. Super original menu with options that you won't see in your everyday restaurant. Every single thing I had was amazing, highly recommend the crispy pig ears and the bone marrow is one of the best things I've ever tasted. Have been planning a trip to Chicago ever since just to eat here again."
,,,,,"Amazing Taste the Purple Pig how can I describe but when I taste there the first time, I thought how can make much best food then I think that I give the good review the purple pic. Thank you for the good food."
,,,,,The lady at the front desk said it was a 30-45 Minute wait.  She texted me
,,,,,"In like 10 Minutes!  Score!!  We ordered the beets, bone marrow and ribs.   First of all I loved the beets - it was delicious!  Best beets I ever had with the pistachios and goat cheese. So yummy!!  The bone marrow was"
,,,,,Good too.  Not used to the fatty marrow and it was still
,,,,,Good. We had to order something pork - so we got the
,,,,,Ribs.  It was nice but I like back pork ribs!   Anyways still a nice restaurant.
,,,,,"Oh my gosh sums it up pretty well. I traveled for work for years, so I've become a bit of a food snob over time. This place is amazing, and definitely one of the best meals I've ever had in Chicago. It is SO busy though, so come during an off time. We showed up around 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday and our wait was less than 5 minutes. By 5:00, the wait was somewhere between 30 - 60 minutes. If you're waiting, it's a bit awkward hanging out outside (weather permitting) or in the back hallway, but the food is so worth it. "
,,,,,"Since pig is in the name, we tried the fried pig ears and the shoulder (pictured). The ears were awesome, but our favorite dish of the night was the prosciutto stuffed calamari -- just incredible. The shoulder was solid, but it was pretty standard fare, especially when compared to some of the other dishes. The scallops were tasty, and the cheesecake was great too. Some people might not like the tight quarters / communal seating, but the ambiance is awesome and the service is solid."
,,,,,Would have been good if they offer 50% of their menu not fried.  Everything is fried. 
,,,,,"Too fatty that surprisingly I could not eat much.  Usually, I could eat a lot more.  It seemed to be all similar.  But battered and fried is the theme.  Or doused with oil including the roasted vegetable.  I thought I like heavy foods!"
,,,,,"I came here to eat with family and friends for my birthday and we had a wonderful experience! The servers were on top of it. I never had to ask for a refill, they explained in quick and precise detail, each dish on the menu and gave great recommendations. The food and service were both superb. I'd highly recommend this if you have not gone here before."
,,,,,I wish all pigs were purple after my dinner at Purple Pig! I went on a day trip with some family members to downtown Chicago and our decision to eat at Purple Pig made the day! The food was amazing! 
,,,,,"My favorite dish was the turkey leg... The meat fell right off the bone! It would have paired very well with the roasted beets, however we gobbled those up as soon as they came out! I also loved the half duck! It was superb and substantial. Of all of our plates, the duck, the turkey, and the beets were the most substantial size-wise. The spare rib was tasty, but a bit tart. The lobster cannoli dish was very good, but the issue was it was too small of a portion. We decided to share a bottle of wine at the table, because the price of individual glasses were quite high. "
,,,,,"The ambiance was nice, but the high-boy group seating wasn't ideal (imagine sharing a table for 16 and rubbing elbows with people you don't know all dinner long).  Their low tables were separated though, so I guess we got unlucky with the seating. "
,,,,,"The service felt a bit rushed, as soon as the last pieces of food were scooped up from the plates, the plates disappeared. "
,,,,,"Overall, I had a great time though, and would definitely look forward to returning again next time I'm in Chicago, which is why I give 5 stars."
,,,,,"Worth every single minute of waiting. We came on a Thursday night and had to wait roughly 85 mins before we got a table (they text you when it's ready), which we thought was still a long time but well worth it. Luckily this place is near many stores so shopping was a delight and definitely killed time. I tried the Spanish octopus which was tender and flavorful with a great balance of salt, sweet, and acid. My husband had the milk braised pork shoulder and was amazed on how tender the meat was. For a place that has been praised and highly reviewed it did not disappoint and deserved every star it has received thus far. If only it was closer to where we live....either way definitely a must visit if you're in the cities."
,,,,,"Terrific food, always need to get a reservation. We had the lobster gazpacho. The gazpacho was sooo good. The fried broccoli was nice as well. "
,,,,,The pasta was so simple yet so good. Pappardelle..
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Fantastic!! My food met so many expectations. I was traveling alone and managed to snag a seat at the bar with no wait (when the wait for a party of 2 was almost 2 hrs, yikes!). "
,,,,,"I love the fun items on their menu; I ordered the duck prosciutto, roasted bone marrow, and burrata cannoli. My favorite was the duck prosciutto - sliced incredibly thinly and truly melted in my mouth! The bone marrow was also stellar, so much umami! The burrata cannoli, while still good, was my least favorite of the three. Most of its pricetag is probably the osetra caviar, otherwise it was small for the price and I actually prefer the texture of fresh burrata over the whipped burrata in the dish."
,,,,,"Seating and service was a bit more of a struggle. With the crazy crowds, the seats (at the bar, at least) were cramped and tightly packed. It was impossible to get a menu in a timely manner with our server running around, but luckily everyone at the bar was super polite and we ended all sharing/passing around a copy of the menu. (In fact, by the time my server came to give me a menu, I already looked through and picked all the items I wanted.)"
,,,,,"Overall, great meal! It's so busy and cramped, but still worth the visit!"
,,,,,"Octopus and Hanger Steak, AMAZING. Forgot to take photos of the sweet corn and desert. "
,,,,,Vanessa the manager and Julian the bartender both AMAZING customer service. Jimmy the chef/owner came to check on us which I really appreciated. Cocktails were all delicious. 
,,,,,"Phase 4 this is the place to be in Chicago, all necessary precautions taken, so friendly and comforting, bus boys also extremely attentive. Host very friendly takes your temp at the door. I haven't been out since March this was my first time and have 0 regrets. Highly encourage"
,,,,,Seriously the best food I've ever had in my life!!  The two other people I dined with (and myself) could only describe the food as life-changing!
,,,,,"Don't let the odd name fool you, this is definitely a spot to try but is a little more on the pricy side. Of course being a tourist in the Windy City, I just had to try!"
,,,,,"This is definitely a hot spot and expect a long wait. I came in at 7pm, got sat around 8:10. Yes, over an hour and I was contemplating whether I should ditch this place or be patient. Glad I waited because I absolutely thought the food was amazing. Like something out of a Top Chef kitchen! Their plates were much smaller, something you see only boujee people eating. Yup, I was proud of it! Haha. The plating was gorgeous and the food was interestingly different and yummy. "
,,,,,"Be mindful coming in... the way they designed the place is totally not meant for people who are claustrophobic! Seriously!! There is an outdoor tent area for you to wait but once you head through their poorly designed tented door/make-shift hallway it's chaos. My cousin and I were sat at a table where the layout of it is long and rectangular. So I was sitting next to another woman and her girlfriend. Idk, maybe I'm being too much of a complainer but damn I'd like my own table! "
,,,,,"Anyway, if you have an open palate you won't be disappointed! The layout of the restaurant was it's only main flaw to me but I still enjoyed my experience."
,,,,,Came here with a friend while I was in Chicago. We had already mapped out what we wanted to for the day and Purple Pig made the cut. I was intrigued by the name and had briefly browsed their menu. I thought it would be good for snacking while out drinking. 
,,,,,"We came on a Friday night, so we knew we would be waiting. It just happened to be raining that day. When we walked up we could tell they were busy, we put our name on the wait and decided to stay to wait they had a tarp we off area with heaters; perfect for a cold rainy night.  I think we were quoted 30 minutes, but didn't even wait half of that.  "
,,,,,"I was a little grown off by the seating, but it ended up being a pretty concept. We didn't have a preference on seating and were seated ""outside"" where they have long tables.  The seating is communal. We got sat and made ourselves comfortable. We each ordered our drinks and cottonwood cheddar plate to snack on. I ventured out and got the Colombian old fashioned. I wasn't very thrilled with my drink of choice, but tried to drink it anyway. The cheese plate was great. Our server, Mauro checked on us and noticed I hadn't drank much of my drink. I told him I didn't really care for it, he took it off our ticket and asked me what else I wanted.  How observant and sweet. "
,,,,,We ended up ordering the morcilla and lobster and the spare ribs.  Everything was delicious and we got to try a new spin in yummy food. 
,,,,,The communal seating allowed us to chat with the couple in front of us and the people next to us. We all chatted about different foods we had ordered. Pretty neat. 
,,,,,"I highly suggest trying this place out. Great for a friends night out. Service and food was great. For a couple of Colombian girls, we were thrilled that our server was Colombian as well.  Make sure y'all ask for Mauro when you visit!!"
,,,,,Came here because of the hype.
,,,,,"It's a pretty good place to day drink and eat Mediterranean food. I got a roasted broccoli with toasted bread crumbs and anchovy vinaigrette. It tastes exactly like roasted broccoli with a thick sauce. I got this because of the Yelp reviews. I honestly do not think I tried the right dishes at the Purple Pig because $40 down, I still don't understand why people are super crazy about this place. The table next to us tried a lot of dishes that seemed more interesting. One was a bone marrow smear dish and many tables got the beet (antipasti?). "
,,,,,"We got the cured meat pig-platter for $34 and split it. It was cute and came on a pig shaped platter. The platter came with 7 different types of meats as well as some crackers and pickled cucumbers in a gooey mustard seed sauce. I wasn't my cup of tea. The platter had hamón, prosciutto, Spanish chorizo, 2 more pepperoni looking things, and one bologna looking thing with pistachio in it. My personal favorites were the ham and Spanish chorizo. I'm honestly not sure of the names of everything, but everything on the platter was chosen by the chef and they were good. This place is pretty intimate despite it being crowded. There is some outdoor seating if you're into that. "
,,,,,"The waiters pour wine really skillfully and are always walking around to check  that everything is okay. The Purple Pig is always busy, so be ready to wait."
,,,,,Nice restaurant and good service. Food was good and creative. The pig ear is amazing and surprised me with its texture. Pork rib is so tender and flavor is awesome.
,,,,,"Fantastic flavors! Every single dish was mouth watering. We lucked out and did not have to wait- we were sat right away. Service was good, our waiter made some great recommendations. We started with a cheese board, which was delicious. We were able to custom choose various cheeses. Of course wine selection was wonderful too. We licked our plates clean."
,,,,,"I know there is so much good food in Chicago, but if you are looking for a casual warm environment with good cookin'- I definitely recommend this place."
,,,,,"We came here for a late lunch to avoid the crowd, but the place was still extremely hectic. I could only imagine what it's like on weekends. We grabbed seats at a long table which was interesting because we could see what everyone else ordered!"
,,,,,- Pig's Ears: A little bit too oily and salty but the pickles gave it a good balance. The crouch of the fried pig ears and kale were good though.
,,,,,- Duck Liver Pate: One of the best pate I've had. It had a good balance of savory and sweet due to the jam. It went well with the bread. 
,,,,,- Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: Highlight of the meal. The meat was falling off tender. The flavor was amazing and the mashed potato was so creamy as well. 
,,,,,"They definitely have a lot of interesting dishes, I'd check it out if the wait isn't too long!"
,,,,,"This place is awesome!!  If you're looking for a nice restaurant downtown Chicago, this is one that I highly recommend!"
,,,,,Came here on a work trip and arrived relatively late (8PM.. that's late for dinner for me).
,,,,,"The ambiance is very much a wine bar (amazing) with tall tables in the middle and nice smaller tables around the edges.  They had a really large party seated at the tall tables, but this didn't distract from service for us."
,,,,,"The wine selection is pretty great!  A bit pricey, but the servers are very knowledgeable and were helpful in selecting a glass.  "
,,,,,Now the food:
,,,,,"We were told to order 1-2 per person as it's ""tapas style.""  The choices we made were rather large so we could actually have taken one away as we were overstuffed with deliciousness."
,,,,,Pork Liver + Bacon Paté (4.5/5)
,,,,,"If you love bacon and pates, this is for you!!  I love pork liver pates, and this straight-up tasted like a bacon spread.  The liver taste wasn't too strong and overall this just worked.  With so many pieces of bread they give you for this, it's quite filling (which isn't a bad thing!)."
,,,,,Ricotta Gnocchi (4/5)
,,,,,I love gnocchi and will order it whenever I see it on a menu.  This was very fluffy and delicious!  The order is large enough to be a meal in itself if you aren't that hungry.  
,,,,,Half Duck Confit (5/5)
,,,,,"OMG!  This was by-far the best thing we had in the evening.  The brioche buns we were expecting to be small (like the bao buns), but these were almost the size of a burger bun!!  The dish comes with 4 of these buns which is crazy!  Between two people, you could order just this and two glasses of wine and be very satisfied with your meal."
,,,,,Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder (4/5)
,,,,,I couldn't appreciate this as I was so full from the half duck confit!  It's very tender and succulent and worth trying... just not when you're already full!  
,,,,,"Overall, I appreciated this restaurant very much and will be coming back!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Solid place to eat weird parts of the pig. If ur into fried pig ears and stuff like that you'll enjoy it. If u think you aren't don't worry you probs are and will enjoy the food if u pretend to not know what's in it
,,,,,"I think it's safe to say that you can't really go wrong with any restaurant that has the word ""pig"" in it...  The Salty Pig in Boston, Pig 'N Whistle in LA, The Pig in DC, the Wooly Pig in SF. Chicago's Purple Pig is the quintessential new American, foodie-centered, trendy-casual, hyped up, hour-long-wait restaurant serving unique and fun creations ranging from crisp Brussels sprouts to pig ears to cured meat and cheese boards. With the motto ""Cheese, swine, and wine"" and a branded gate entrance alongside the river, it's difficult not to be captivated by the restaurant's charm."
,,,,,"They don't take reservations, but there is a decently sized covered tarp with heating (!) and tall tables where you can order appetizers and drinks. You can also go for a walk and check out downtown (including the impressive candy store), because they have a nice texting system that gives you 10 minutes to return and claim your table."
,,,,,"My biggest issue with the Purple Pig is the perpetual first world problem of the difficulties deciding what to order. The menu has a large selection of interesting offerings, and this is one of those places you want to return to multiple times before officially crossing it off your bucket list."
,,,,,"(++) Assortment of locally foraged mushrooms ($15): In my mind I had the image of a purple pig on a leash foraging for truffles and rare mushrooms. While the mushrooms where less bouge than truffles, it was a satisfying dish with the variety of succulent mushrooms. The hearty, earthy taste paired with the tart (purple!) berry sauce was a subtle surprise. "
,,,,,"(+++) Pork spare ribs with BBQ sauce + farro ($18): Omg this is possibly the most meticulously fine-tuned ribs I've ever had. The meat is so tender it appears to fall off the bone spontaneously, and the flavors are robust with prominent smokey tones, with hints of bacon and ham. I thought the thick overlaying sauce would be overwhelming, but the mix of BBQ sauce and creamy yogurt-like drizzle added dimensions of familiarity and novelty. Not sure if I could go back to plain old BBQ ribs now."
,,,,,"(++) Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes + puffed farro ($19): This was a fascinating dish with the pork so tender and mashed potatoes so creamy, it is of molten consistency that melts in your mouth. It is rather indulgent but not too unbearably rich, because they creatively use pork shoulder infused with milk rather than fatty pork belly. Intriguingly, the only contrast is the topping of crispy puffed farro."
,,,,,"Portions are surprisingly big, and the food is quite filling. Although Yelp classifies it as tapas, I wouldn't go trigger happy and go on foodie spree while ordering. (3 plates for 2 hungry people was plenty, and we could barely finish the food)"
,,,,,"The ambiance is lively and hip, and the details such as the marble tables, branded water carafes and silverware, and stellar food presentation make for excellent photogenic touches."
,,,,,"It's definitely of gastropub caliber, and the Purple Pig would land squarely in the realm of fine dining if they halved their portions, doubled their prices, and placed half of its customers in a quadrupled space at 1/10th the noise level."
,,,,,"Great place for unique and tasty modern tapas! The Purple Pig is located right on Michigan, the dining space is actually a bit smaller than expected but the interior is cozy and inviting, with the kitchen in full display. Came here with my girlfriend for an early valentine's day and had a delicious meal. Their menu is surprisingly varied, with cheese/charcuterie, a couple pastas, meat and seafoods, veggies, and even a section for offals (organs!). We decided in the crispy pig ear (apparently a popular item), the butternut squash, octopus cavatelli, and cuttlefish."
,,,,,"Crispy pig ears - a big portion of crispy fried pig ear bits, mixed with fried kale, chopped pickled cherry peppers for a nice tart kick, and a runny fried egg. The pig ears were fried perfectly and super crispy, but could've been seasoned more"
,,,,,"Butternut squash - a couple slices of tender squash with what I think was a rich, sweet pea puree and szechuan peppercorn foam.  Refreshing and delicious, the components worked together surprisingly well!"
,,,,,"Cuttlefish - my favorite dish there. The slices of cuttlefish were tender, with a thick and super savory squid consomme that complemented the creamy pepper aioli"
,,,,,"Cavatelli - the octopus ragu was thick and full of savory seafood flavor with just enough of a spicy kick from the peppers. Unfortunately, it was too salty."
,,,,,"Walnut caramel tart - packed full of caramel coated nuts, served with a delicious pear sage sorbet that took it to another level."
,,,,,"While some dishes were better than others, I enjoyed every dish here and appreciated how experimental and unique they were, but with the flavors all complementing each other well. This is not just any old tapas place, but a destination I would recommend for any Chicago foodie looking to expand past steakhouses or Italian food. Looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes!"
,,,,,"Had a great time here! Stopped in on a whim on a beautiful day and got sat outside immediately, which i was shocked about because the place was extremely busy. We really enjoyed the whipped feta and the milk braised Berkshire shoulder! This is a great spot for a group and super interactive."
,,,,,"I ordered from the Purple Pig for a special birthday celebration and the food was absolutely incredible and very well packaged.  It made for an amazing meal; I would highly recommend them for pick up and can't wait to go in person at a different time!  Favorite dishes included: pork belly, spanish octopus, roasted bone marrow, braised pork shoulder, and chicken thigh kebabs."
,,,,,"What can I say, this restaurant is amazing! I've always wanted to come here but my first attempt was a fail due to their relocation. Anyways, I came not long after and finally tried it out! "
,,,,,"Food: Amazing. We tried out around 6 different dishes and all of them were amazing. I personally love the octopus and pork shoulder. They were both so memorable and tasty! The portion was also pretty standard for 5 of us and they came out relatively fast. Definitely get the octopus, my favorite!"
,,,,,"Ambiance: I've never been to the old location but this new one is really nice. It's located inside an office building (I think) and is pretty spacious with great lighting. The restaurant itself is pretty bright and has a nice, modern, decoration that compliments the dishes well. "
,,,,,Service: Our host was very attentive and helpful in providing recommendations of how many dishes we should get and what's popular. He was very knowledgeable and friendly too!
,,,,,"Price: For the quality you're getting, I think it's well worth it. Each dish cost somewhere from $15 to $28 so it was relatively standard for these kind of restaurants. "
,,,,,"Overall, I'm very happy I tried this. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in Chicago and getting their octopus for sure!"
,,,,,Excellent food as usual. The bone marrow was my favorite dish. Huge bone. The grilled broccoli was tasty.  
,,,,,"I've noticed the small plates have gotten larger & more expensive, so hold back your initial order if you're used to the Purple Pig of the past.  "
,,,,,I'm glad they moved next door. Now you can wait in line indoors vs in the elements as before.
,,,,,This place was highly recommended by everyone. I'm glad the food lives up to the hype!
,,,,,Lucky for us this place was right across from our hotel (the Intercontinental). Came by this place around 5:30pm. The hostess said it would be 1-1.5hr wait. We decided to sit outside since it was open seating and we had a play to catch at 7:30pm.
,,,,,"No surprise, but it was cold outside. I would like to give a huge shoutout to JOSIE for being an amazing waitress!! She casually approached my friend and I and gave us some wonderful tips. She told us the wait time is actually quicker than it is and we should just put our name down on the list. She also made the effort to try to get us seated inside by the bar. She was very attentive towards us and exemplified quality customer service! She started off with a bottle of wine as we waited. She was not our server when we got seated inside, but she was very sweet towards us while we were waiting outside. You're the best, Josie!"
,,,,,Food wise was quality as well! All shareable. I wish someone told us the half duck confit was massive! Haha my favorite was the MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER. Definitely a MUST if you come here. So freakinggggg tender!! I also enjoyed the assortment of cheese we got too..I just wasn't sure which was which. I love cheese either way.
,,,,,-1 star because I'm not a big fan of sharing one long table with other people. And definitely did not wait hours for the individual tables lol. Very crowded/popular place.
,,,,,"Other than that, everything was great! Would definitely go back."
,,,,,Came here for dinner at our bachelorette party outing. I wish my group did not attend Ribfest the day before as we were still stuffed from that event. The food is very nicely presented and my favorite dish for the whole evening was the pig ears. I am used to the Chinese style braised pig ears and having it shredded and fried left quite the impression.
,,,,,My only complaint about this place is how the seating is. It is just so crowded and a simple tip of the balance will have food falling all over customers.
,,,,,Delicious! Great service. My waiter asked me about my preferences and we built a charcuterie board accordingly. My cocktail was so refreshing. Good ambiance. I can't wait to go back!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"This is a nice restaurant, just a few steps from Michigan Ave. We came for lunch, and will definitely be coming back many times more."
,,,,,"The service is great: wonderful presentation of food, and the food was very tasty. We got the bone marrow, scallops, and meatballs. The bone marrow was very interesting. I've never had bone marrow before, but it looked very impressive and the balance of flavors and textures between the cilantro, bread, salt, and bone marrow was excellent. The scallops looked great on the plate, one of them was a little over cooked, but the other two were perfect. The polenta and garnishes were great complements to the scallops. The meatballs were just amazing. They were soft, with nice mild flavors, and the sauces and garnishes complemented them very well. "
,,,,,"Overall, the food was amazing. The presentation of the food is so colorful, and the flavors and textures were contrasting and balanced. The only downside is that the tables in the restaurant are very close to each other, and the restaurant can be loud when it's busy... but hey to some people this might be not be a downside"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was everything and more. INCREDIBLE. If you like cheese, swine, and wine, this is the place for you. Every plate I've tried has been outstanding and filled with unique flavors I had not experienced. The menu is also always changing, which is something I both love and hate in a restaurant, simply because sometimes my favorites are taken away. "
,,,,,"It is a super fun date spot too because a lot of the portions/appetizers are perfect for sharing, meaning you can try a lot of new things together. It is also conveniently located in the heart of downtown, making it a fun place for dinner before a night of drinks. All in all, just amazing. Words were lost my first time going, and they still are! I now fully understand why it is on the Michelin guide. "
,,,,,"Food I've tried: The Purple Pig platter (the ultimate meat and cheese heaven!!), grilled broccoli, pork tongue, octopus a la plancha, and fried manchego"
,,,,,Drinks I've tried: Verdant and Pastoral gin cocktails
,,,,,"When a spot has over 5500 reviews, I make it a point to check it out. The roommate and I walked in on Monday, December 4th around when they opened at 11:30am. Luckily, there were only a few parties seated, so we got a table for two right away. The restaurant filled up fairly quickly, so I suggest getting here early as they do not take reservations."
,,,,,"*Pig's Ear: Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers + Fried Egg ($13)"
,,,,,"*Octopus: Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes + Salsa Verde ($20)"
,,,,,*Ribeye Lunch Special ($18)
,,,,,"*NV Montsarra, Brut, Cava, Macabeo/Xarel-lo/Parellada ($10 for 5oz glass)"
,,,,,"We started with the octopus. It was tender with a good chew. And I adored the salsa verde. The whole dish was a touch salty though. The pig ears were my fav. Crispy and chewy. The fried egg, kale, and peppers went well with the dish. The ribeye was a special they were offering. Meat sounded good, so we decided to get it. This dish was salty as well, but the ribeye was cooked to a nice medium rare. I'm more of a rare girl, so this was too cooked for me. I think they pre-cook the steaks as our server said they couldn't do rare. "
,,,,,"The restaurant itself is cute. Has a lively cafe type of vibe. I didn't watch much of the action in the open kitchen as we were seated in one of the tables along the wall, but I can imagine it being entertaining if you were seated at the bar. Our server was nice and attentive. Recommended the glass of bubbly for me."
,,,,,"I'd love to come back and try more dishes. Since we were on an eating marathon of sorts, we only tried three things. There was so much more I wanted to sample. The Purple Pig, I'll probably be back!"
,,,,,"One of my favorite places in chicago. The braised turkey leg and the bone marrow are a must. Long waits, but well worth it."
,,,,,"This place is a gem on the Magnificent Mile. I've come here twice (separated by 8 years), and was blown away by the quality of food and service on both occasions. "
,,,,,"This is a super popular place, expect a wait of 1-2 hours easily, as people usually stay here a while. Its a small plates and drinks kind of place, and if the weather is bad outside (like it was when I went) people won't be any hurry to leave!"
,,,,,"We started with the bobota greek cornbread (loved the honey and cheese on top of the bread), and the 3 cheese selection (Manchego, La Retorta & Brigante). We also got a bottle of MACEDONIA, Kamara Estate, Assyrtiko from Thessaloniki, Greece which was fabulous, it was an orange wine!!"
,,,,,"For the next round of food we got the Octopus a la plancha, some of the most tender Octopus I've had ever! Next we had the deviled eggs - fantastic again. And we had also ordered the Chicken thigh kebabs which were some of the juiciest kebabs I've had in the US! Our order of the kebabs was delayed a bit so they gave us a complementary fried Manchego cheese which hit the spot as well. "
,,,,,"Overall, don't miss dining here if you're ever in Chicago. And you can't go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu, so order away!"
,,,,,"The place was incredible. I came in as a solo diner and sat down at a packed bar. The restaurant was slammed, especially for a weekday. Regardless of how busy it was, the service was still very good, even at a packed bar with swamped bartenders. I ate the Bavette Steak and English Muffin with Truffle Sausage and both were amazing. This place is easily one of my favorite places."
,,,,,"Not as good as I expected. The vibe in the place was very good, lively and loud. That's to be expected on a Friday evening. The smells from the kitchen were fabulous. We could not wait to eat."
,,,,,"Unfortunately the two entrees that were ordered were only okay. The charcuterie we ordered was the best part. Cuts of Orange walnut Salami, duck prochutto were wonderful. The Gorgonzola, pecorino and brigante al tartufo was equally delicious cheese pairing along with the mustard, pickle and sweet relish sides."
,,,,,"The pork belly & tenderloin, and Blade steak was just ok. Flavor profile by itself was good but the combinations were far from what my nose and mind (mouth too) were expecting. On the blade steak, the Arugula was over dressed and sobrasada +honey needed to be creamier."
,,,,,Even the crunchy pork ears were not all that. This dish needed two eggs not 1. The egg is what makes the dish come alive as it provides a good contrast of flavor between the crispy ear and fried kale.
,,,,,"I must admit though that I may not have ordered the right dishes, or even signature dishes. So I am willing to try the place again."
,,,,,"Everyone knows the children's story: ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".  Hans Christian Anderson, wrote the story over 180 years ago, but I think it applies to The Purple Pig.  Four Stars and over 5,500 reviews?  I don't get it.  "
,,,,,"This restaurant has been on my bucket list for years.  Yesterday, (December 30th) I was finally able to check it off my list.  My wife and I stopped-in late afternoon, and luckily only had about a 10 minute wait.  The place is tiny, and tables are shoehorned in.  To that point, if you are a large person and your table is toward the back of the restaurant, you might have an awkward moment getting to your seat.  "
,,,,,On to the food:  
,,,,,"I was eager to try the bone marrow (I love bone marrow).  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.  It was very rich, yet bland, (is that possible).  It was accompanied with some greasy toasted bread.  The marrow is greasy enough, why was the bread greasy?  In fairness, it probably would have been better, if we were a party of 4 or maybe 6.  It was too much for two people and became a burden to eat.  "
,,,,,We also ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes + Puffed Farro.  It tasted like corned beef.  I don't like corned beef.  The cornbread was good.  The cheese platter was average.  
,,,,,"Service was fine.  The crowd appeared to be mostly tourists and shoppers.  I'm glad I finally dined here, but I highly doubt I'll ever return."
,,,,,"I was visiting Chicago and decided to try out this place since it was very highly rated and close to my hotel. We came right when the restaurant opened so we didn't have to wait, but the seats filled up very quickly afterwards. "
,,,,,"All the dishes were nicely plated, but unfortunately they are all super salty - at least for my taste. "
,,,,,"Broccoli: Nice texture, but has an interesting sour taste from the vinaigrette. This helped smooth out the salty taste from other stuff we ordered."
,,,,,"Pig ears: almost every table ordered this and it seemed like their ""must get"" item on the menu. The pig ears were fried so it tastes almost like chips...they were good, but again too salty. "
,,,,,"Pasta with homemade meatballs (forgot the exact name): this was SUPER salty, I think mainly from the meatball. "
,,,,,Milk braised pork shoulder: this was good as the meat was super tender. Unfortunately this came really late and we were already full (of salt). 
,,,,,"Overall, I think the place is too salty for me, but I do think they have a creative menu. Maybe it's just not for me."
,,,,,"We have been wanting to come to The Purple Pig for a long time now!  We finally made it out, and the food did not disappoint! We really liked the ricotta gnocchi - they were amazingly tender and the red sauce was so delicious! The grilled broccoli was super yummy, and even a 9 year old picky eater approved them! The octopus a la plancha was very tender, and my wife loved it!  The only downside were the prices and what you get for them. I think the tapas concept has lost its real meaning of small, inexpensive plates that allow diners to taste many different items for the same price as a traditional dinner entree. The tapas concept in Chicagoland is basically the ability to charge entree prices for appetizers, and the silly patrons still pay... so the real winners are the restaurateurs... sorry - rant over. Also, for faster seating, please be ready to be seated at a communal table - this was unusual for us, but worked out just fine. "
,,,,,"Even though I am disappointed with the prices, we really enjoyed all the food, and were completely stuffed when we left - and the food rather than the prices and ambiance really earned the 5 star rating!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Great takeout. Everything was packaged nicely. Had the broccoli, whipped feta, and orecchiette with sausage. All three were great"
,,,,,"I don't know why, but my favorite item here is the broccoli. There's just something special about it. I also enjoy the pate here. This place is great to hang out and catch up with friends, as the plates are for sharing!"
,,,,,"The good is very good, with high quality ingredients prepared with care. The front of the house, however, is awful. Poorly trained, in attentive waiters who reach cross the table, drop utensils on guests and get defensive when asked qualifying questions. Don't come here in a date or if you are trying to impressive your guest; you will be disappointed by the third rate wait staff."
,,,,,"Absolutely love this place! And well worth the wait, although I always plan ahead to have the 1-2 hour wait. I highly suggest smaller parties to go with to have a smaller wait time. The place is semi small so it definitely gets crowded quickly and all the time. Also there always seems to be a line for the restrooms. "
,,,,,What I recommend:
,,,,,"Pig ear - super crunchy, with kale, and pickled peppers. It's even great two days later just microwaved and soggy! The flavors just blend so well together"
,,,,,Bone marrow - this is super rich so I recommend splitting it between multiple people. The added salt is a must
,,,,,Pork shoulder - so tender you don't need a knife 
,,,,,Broccoli - a simple dish done just right with a great amount of flavor
,,,,,Pretty much am obsessed with this place. Definitely have to plan ahead for the wait time especially in the summer when everyone is out enjoying the great weather. Would recommend going with 2-3 people as it's a shorter wait time.
,,,,,"The pig ears, broccoli, and pork shoulder are to die for. Also their kale is A-MAZE-ING! Service is great too, but due to the size and how crowded it gets, you definitely won't get a full table to yourself unless you have a big party."
,,,,,"Ok, my eyes were way bigger than my belly. "
,,,,,"While everyone raves about the pork, my favorites were the antipasti. The beets. I want more beets, more cauliflower. All the veg. Trust me. "
,,,,,I'll definitely be back!
,,,,,"Great! The food is top-notch, great variety, and plenty of vegetarian options. The ambiance is pretty cool. So glad to have them in our neighborhood. Will frequent this spot for sure."
,,,,,First and foremost I'll answer the question you're here for. They do not take reservations or call-aheads.  
,,,,,"Tucked on the corner of Michigan and Illinois, this spot kept popping up on Yelp so we had to give it a try. One of our favorite places in our home city was a tapas restaurant so this was perfect for our first dinner in Chicago."
,,,,,"Reason for the 4 star: It's a small location. I felt cold because the door kept opening and closing. I know it's Chicago and to deal with it, but it got a little out of hand and made it uncomfortable for the second half of our dinner. The host was not as friendly and made it seem like us coming a little after 10pm as bad. "
,,,,,"The good: We loved our server Ty. My husband and I nodded after the first time he spoke to us in agreement that he was so hospitable. He recommended his favorites so in turn this is what I recommend to you: Gnocchi, Broccoli, and Pork Shoulder. Absolutely delicious, fresh, and came out fast! We did the short ribs too but we would've survived without it."
,,,,,Thank you for letting us stay a little past you being closed!
,,,,,"Wow! I had always heard about the purple Pig and it did live up to its reputation. We went at an odd time on a Saturday so we were luckily able to be seated straight away. Our waiter explained the format of the menue that most things you share a few plates. After some debate over what to get as everything looked so good we choose three main items. We started off with the pig ears, ricotta gnocchi with pork shoulder, and stuffed squid. They also have a cheese menu and we were super close to choosing a braised meat that looked amazing! They also had plenty of veggie options to choose from. To our surprise the squid came out first and it was beautifully plated. The squid was stuffed with this amazing creation and served with mushed favas and thr most amazing pesto. Each bite of the squid was cooked to perfection. The pig ears were served with egg and kale. Also very good and would be better with beer. Those two items came out super quick. However, it took a much longer time for our gnocchi to come...so much so we thought they may have forgotten it. Eventually it did come and was well worth the wait. The most tender and tasty gnocchi is the most favorable sauce and meat cooked so tenderly. We loved our meal so mu h we actually ended up ordering dessert which we never do. Amazing menu with several different items to  choose.  We went with the brown sugar cheese cakes topped with pomegranate. This was so rich and decadent. Very well done! I really hope we can come back again."
,,,,,Disappointed. I had high expectations since I've heard so much about this place and had it bookmarked for years.
,,,,,- They don't take reservations and the wait was about ~30min on a random Tuesday 5:30pm
,,,,,"- The bone marrow, brussel sprouts, and pig ears, and pork shoulder were all nothing special. Tastes just like any other restaurant that serves these dishes and I think I was expecting more of an elevated experience. Instead, I felt the brussel sprouts were too limey and the pork shoulder was too bland. Same with the pig ears.. like crispy onions with less flavor. The ingredients they paired with bone marrow was nothing out of the ordinary... just salt and some arugula. "
,,,,,"- The beets were really good! Light, fresh, and delicious. Not sure what that creme was that they served it with, but complemented the beets perfectly! Would order 5 plates of beets instead of everything I ordered."
,,,,,"Updating to 4 stars based on my last experience. I'm sure that the standout dishes that I've loved before are still great, but my most recent visit was lackluster and left a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively). "
,,,,,"I had a mushroom raviolo with honey and truffles, which was not good - way too sweet and not balanced with the savory. Would not order again. I also had the smoked pork tongue, which was easily the best bites of the night and something I would definitely order again. But then the meal went downhill - for my entree, the server recommended the pork blade steak, which was served with nduja sausage and a small arugula salad. This was the saltiest dish I've eaten in a long while, it was unbelievable. The pork was salty, the arugula salad was saltier, and to top it off the nduja sausage was extremely salty as well. No balance whatsoever, I probably had at least 5 water refills during this course alone. And - I wasn't able to finish (I actually felt sick); anyone who knows me knows this never happens, as I usually finish everyone else's food. "
,,,,,"Anyway, will stick to the classic orders next time. But it will probably be a while before I return, there are so many good restaurants in Chicago and there's no reason to wait or come at an odd hour for Purple Pig (for me at least, since I've been multiple times now)."
,,,,,"Just an update - food is still amazing. Service this time was bad, but whatever. "
,,,,,"The foie gras torchon is so good, as is the grilled octopus. The salt cured beets was one of my favorite dishes of the night - so simple but so delicious, and a good sized portion as well."
,,,,,"Also tried the bone marrow, and purple potato chips with potato ice cream and caviar - these were tasty, but not on the same level as the three mentioned above. The desserts I would skip next time as well (ordered a chocolate cake and a panna cotta)"
,,,,,"We liked our meal so much we tried to return the next night of our visit, but the wait was 2 hours long...maybe time for an expansion or second location?"
,,,,,The Purple Pig was one of my favorite meals recently. I loved it and will definitely return to try more.
,,,,,"It is popular/pretty small, and crowded - there wasn't much room but I squeezed in at the communal table. Service was pretty good, server was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided a couple spot on recommendations that I wasn't planning to order."
,,,,,Foie gras and pork terrine. Amazing. This dish was so good and started the meal off perfectly. I should've ordered two of these for myself. 
,,,,,"Fried brussels sprouts - loved the texture. Great flavor too, but I thought this dish was a little too oily and over salted. "
,,,,,"Octopus with salsa verde and green beans. Delicious, perfectly cooked octopus, great flavors in this dish, perfect portion. So good. "
,,,,,"Gnocchi with oxtail ragout - gnocchi was perfectly cooked and fluffy. The sauce/ragout lacked flavor and there was barely any oxtail. My least favorite dish of the night (the others were pretty exceptional), but still enjoyable and had no problem finishing."
,,,,,"The server recommended 2 to 3 dishes. 4 was definitely a lot of food, but I got through it all. Good price for what you get."

,,,,,"Never in my life have I gotten as pissed and I did at the bartender here.  I asked for a drink suggestion -- I told him I wanted something fresh (like with mint, lime, etc.) , he gave me a weird look, laughed in my face, and talked about me to his coworker behind my back.  "
,,,,,That's why I hate these gimmicky places with a million Yelp reviews because people like this dude work there who think they're hot sh*t.  
,,,,,I walked out with my wife. 
,,,,,Never stepping foot in here again.
,,,,,This is the third time we have been here and it is a must go every time we are in Chicago!! We love the crispy pigs ears and ham croquettes!  We can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu!
,,,,,"So I know there is a HUGE hype around this restaurant but I just don't think it was worth the 2 hour wait. I get that this is Tapas so the plates will be small, but it is very highly priced and my group of 3 got 5 plates and were still hungry. We each paid around $40 for these 5 plates. My friend thought he had ordered a $15 glass of wine but instead was charged $30. He asked about it and the waitress said he chose the $30 one so it was a bit suspicious. The service was not great at all. My friend was horrified by the asparagus because it was like the thinnest pieces ever of asparagus however I loved the flavors and wish there was just thicker pieces. Flavor is good on the dishes but if there is a 2 hour wait I'd say pass on this restaurant! I'm sure there are much more affordable tapas places!"
,,,,,outstanding! last time we visited Chicago was 10 yrs ago and food is still amazing.
,,,,,"Deliciousness! The ambiance is inviting and there's beautiful European culture and design seen throughout the restaurant itself. The restaurant does not take reservations and is first come first serve. Luckily we walked in and we were greeted by a friendly face and sat immediately. The menu itself is divine and we look forward to coming back and trying more items. The service was informative, passionate and friendly throughout our dining experience. We took our servers suggestions and ordered 3 shareable menu items. The cauliflower Caesar salad, Octopus ala plancha and 1/2 duck. Each plate delivered flavors and textures that were new, exciting and beautifully executed! This is a must do when we visit Chicago again and we cannot wait to come back!"
,,,,,"Came here a minute after they opened on a Saturday and there were people seated already. Goes to show how popular this touristy ""tapas"" spot is! "
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,- Roasted Bone Marrow: 4.5/5. Mm smear that marrow on perfectly toasted bread with some herb salad & throw in some salt bae action. Bam. Delish.
,,,,,- Octopus: 4/5. Cooked perfectly! Only qualm was the salsa verde... so salty...
,,,,,- Braised Pork Shoulder: 5/5. Omg mouthwatering; highly recommend. You know it be good if the meat falls apart with a tiny touch of the fork. Also bias because I'm a lover of mashed potatoes. So this dish did it for me.
,,,,,SERVICE: Quick. In and out in an hour. We inquired about how much to order and the waiter was spot on. 
,,,,,AMBIANCE: They have indoor and outdoor seating.
,,,,,"Absolutely phenomenal. Amazing wine list with great variety. The Wagyu beef, half duck, and squid were delicious. I would recommend doing the meat and cheese board. Great selections! My new favorite restaurant."
,,,,,"Can be pricey, but totally worth it."
,,,,,Let's get the (2) negatives out of the way......
,,,,,"Dumbest wine menu you'll ever come across!  Don't believe me?  Take a shot at trying to figure it out, and get back to me!  Immediately upon questioning the waitress how it was organized, she immediately asked my name, and asked that I hold on, as she wanted me to speak to the guy who put it together.  That there tells you that I'm not alone/there is an issue.  The guy was an arrogant @#$hole BTW."
,,,,,"Next- $168 opening price point for a bottle of California Cab....I'm down with a good wine, but cut me a break!"
,,,,,Ok- now to the good stuff!
,,,,,- Food
,,,,,- Food
,,,,,- Food
,,,,,- Unique selection!
,,,,,- Great for sharing!
,,,,,- Small but fun atmosphere!
,,,,,"Best dish, the broccoli- yes, crazy right!  Order it, order two, order three!"
,,,,,"Cheese plate, yes please!  Anything and everything we had was amazing!  Oh dessert too!"
,,,,,"One caution- no reservations, so unless you got some pull, expect a wait."
,,,,,Did I mention the wine list layout?  :)
,,,,,"The food was delicious, and service was great. There were a lot of people when we arrived so we waited a while (even though we had reservation) and it was very loud in the restaurant. We were also sitting very close to the people beside us, so it was hard to get intimate. That being said, the playing and taste of the food is top notch"
,,,,,"Easily the best and most enjoyable meal I've had in the city. Apparently the wait here is notorious for being, on average, 1-2 hrs long. No reservations taken. But on both attempts that I've visited, I've either been able to sit right away (for 2) on a Saturday night at 5pm, or like last night, was told it would be a 1.5hr wait and ended up being 15mins (for 3) at 7pm on a weekday. "
,,,,,"Seating ranges from private tables to communal to barside and standing room only. Theme is Mediterranean tapas but some of the seafood, pork and beef dishes are full-sized entrees. Price points are more than fair and reasonable for the quality. Perfect location to impress a date or friends visiting from out of town."
,,,,,"Ordered the Buttersquash Empanadas (black truffle oil, squash, cheese filling with apple sauce demiglaze and the cutest melted marshmallow pillow on a cinnamon stick), Pork Ossabuco, Red Snapper on red cabbage sauce, Octopus with potatoes and asparagus, and a Fried Hash & Chorizo dish I cannot remember the name of."
,,,,,"Aside from that last dish, I would order any of the dishes again. Food comes out promptly in no particular order (per host) and piping hot. I broke my pescetarian fast and had some of the Ossabuco - it was heavenly! The meat pulled off the bone so easily and the goblets of fat melted in your mouth. It was generously doused with tomato and polenta sauces. The Octopus was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Extemely tender and meaty inside but nicely charred on the outside. Red snapper was fresh, nicely charred and delish with a red cabbage sauce that was tart and sweet at the same time (looked and tasted akin to poi, lol). The Empanadas were also yummy, just consider this a dessert rather than an appetizer. "
,,,,,It was fun to eye all the orders next to my party bc every dish looked amazing. Only regret was not being able to try the dessert menu bc I was stuffed. 
,,,,,"Aside: I rarely comment on the service of an eatery bc it's about the food, not having my ego stroked. However I would like to say that it was my last meal in town, and I had brought my luggage bag with me. The host was kind enough to store the bag in a discrete corner during my meal. However, the manager/person walking the floors in glasses took one look at my bag in that corner, sneered and asked what it was doing there. Host said it was a luggage piece, manager sneered again and said ""I know, what's that doing there?"" And I was right in front of him the whole time. Way to make me feel low and ashamed of being a tourist trying to squeeze in a last good meal before heading to the airport. He was rude and ""acted like he owned the joint."" The good food and company of my party washed away that horrid encounter  early on in the night."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Overall very worth the hype! Food is creative and generally good, although the ambiance and service could use a little improvement. "
,,,,,"We were lucky to be seated right away at 7 pm on a Wednesday. Although the place is packed, inside the little room and on the patio. The overall turnout of food and service was not too slow at all."
,,,,,"Food: all of their dishes are going extreme. They're great creative and tasty ones, don't take me wrong. But their spice use and flavor level is very extreme. Like the Chilled Calamari, the calamari itself was so salty that your tongue would go numb for a few seconds if you have 3 bites in a row. So does the Eggplant Caponata, the mixture of sourness and sweetness is the only thing you can taste of the bite. You can't even tell there are eggplants there. Roasted Bone Marrow, same thing. It's like eating warm fat. It's like, the cooks punch you with the pure flavors in the face. I'd appreciate if I can taste some of the textures of food more with lighter flavors. "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Service: The lady at the front door was very cold and unwelcoming. So does our waitress. You can tell that they are busy and trying to juggle with all the people they have to serve. But come on, at least try to pretend you mean it when you ask ""How's everything"", instead of dropping the question then leave. But the Manager, I believe, is very attentive and nice. "
,,,,,"They have an extensive drinking menu. So if you like spirits and wine, you would for sure appreciate their 30 something page drinking menu. "
,,,,,"Overall a good place to eat and give it a try, but is it worth 2 hours of wait? I don't think so."
,,,,,Came here early on a Thursday (430pm) and the place was already getting packed! Sat at the bar. Was kind of confusing at first to figure out who the server was but we ended up with a great one (Flint). 
,,,,,"The wine list is a bit overwhelming. There are tons of by the glass options but no tasting notes or info about the producers. I was disappointed that they didn't have any natural or organic producers or skin contact options. Took a while to figure out what I wanted but ended up trying several: a pet nat white blend, a Lambrusco Bianco, a floral rosé and a bone dry rosé. "
,,,,,"Food was good but heavy. Even the apps. We got the fried pork ears with crispy kale and runny egg (10/10), smoked pork Jowl with a potato/pasta salad (6/10- was too mayo-y and vinegar-y) and grilled broccoli tossed in garlic anchovy (9/10- would have liked the broccoli a little crunchier but the sauce was spectacular)."
,,,,,Bland food to go along with poor customer service. I don't understand why this place got so many good reviews maybe because the tourists don't know what better food they can get.
,,,,,"Order: Octopus, Crispy Pig Ear and glass of Pinot Grigio"
,,,,,"This place was highly recommend to me. A MUST for my first time visiting Chicago they said. And boy am I glad that I listened. This place is DELICIOUS! I went out of my comfort zone and ordered the octopus and crispy pig ear and it was an explosion of flavor. Really it was. The atmosphere is lively and staff are friendly. They don't take reservations. But I didn't have any issues as I sat at the bar. They serve the full menu at the bar. Prices are not cheap but definitely worth the price. They also have a full selection of wines. So you won't have any issues finding something that goes with your meal. And when in doubt, just ask the bartenders for their recommendations."
,,,,,"Conclusion: A MUST if you're looking for food with FLAVOR and a hip, lively place to meet friends or just go by yourself."
,,,,,"I am really amazed with this The Purple Pig Restaurant, their food is so great, and their store has an awesome ambiance. Their service was so lit! Even all of them are so busy they can still manage to treat all of their customers so well. All of them are so accommodating and nice, they all know how to serve all the customers and make them comfortable. Their place is so clean, bright, and decent. Lots of decoration around, great atmosphere, and very impressive place. They also got the perfect location, it is easy to go to, and they are near to other landmark in the city. I give this store a 5-star because of their phenomenal food, great customer service, pleasant atmosphere of their place, and such an enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend stopping by and try their foods here in Chicago. I will invite all of my friends and family for them to join me next time I visit. Thank you Purple Pig! Keep up the good work. Thumbs up!"
,,,,,"Came here on Tuesday for dinner (5:00) and had no wait for a party of two! The waiter recommended around two plates per person, so we decided to get two meat dishes, a veggie, and seafood dish. My favorite was definitely the bone marrow! The dishes were a lot bigger than expected, so we were stuffed after 3! We got the bone marrow, milk braised shoulder, calamari, and salted beets. My favorite was definitely the bone marrow; the balance of fresh onion/veggies with the rich marrow was amaazing! Our waiter was also SO wonderful, and overall the experience was great but it IS quite pricey."
,,,,,Everything here is so over the top and rich- which is exactly what I came here for.  The bone marrow and duck were our favorites.  Walked a couple miles afterwards on Michigan ave.  5/5
,,,,,My best friend and I split tapas at their bar. Nice inside but the wait to get a seat was an hour and a half long but the bar is first come first serve.. we lucked out and got a seat at their bar. They have a big bar lots of seats! Bartender was great and attentive .. Fabio looking with long hair .  He was nice and gave us suggestions. We went with the fried manchego which was delicious! Melted with such good flavoring in your mouth came with a jelly type sauce for sweetness but we were not a fan of that.. then out to the scallops and clam dish so yummy! Great combination and we ended with the best dish pork belly and pork tenderloin. Both cooked to perfection and let a great pig flavoring in the mouth. Overall very pleased and would come back
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,Yum yum yum! 
,,,,,"We ordered the ribeye, blaze steak, and turkey leg and all three were insanely amazing. "
,,,,,"This place was packed when we went around 4pm on a Saturday, but we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes which was great. "
,,,,,"Communal style seating, which is cool. However, the seat I sat at, which is not designed great at all - high table near the window, three of us were at the end of the table. This meant every time someone that was sitting in the inner seats had to get up, I had to stand up to let them out because there wasn't enough space behind the table. (4x I had to do this and this is why I subtracted 1 Star) "
,,,,,It's very loud in the restaurant as well FYI. 
,,,,,The service was wonderful! 
,,,,,"Overall, I would go back here as I definitely want to try more on the menu, but I will definitely opt to sit in another seat."

,,,,,"We waited 1 hour and 20 minutes in anticipation for this place because of such great reviews and my sister's friend who just ate there said the food was good. However, it was a big disappointment. Here is what we ordered:"
,,,,,Bone marrow: the herb salad was a little salty and you don't need to add any more salt. It was okay.  
,,,,,Broccoli: flavor was okay but it was also a little too salty. 
,,,,,"Octopus: octopus was very chewy, flavor was okay, and the green beans was too salty. We ate a few pieces and then couldn't eat any more. "
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"The main reason this very cool place get's 5 stars is that for desert they have an amazing panna cotta. On our great trip to Chicago we were hoping to find it at an Italian place, but couldn't."
,,,,,To our surprise this cool joint had it and we loved it.
,,,,,All the food we ordered was great. The only thing I wish was different is that ricotta gnocchi were in light cream sauce instead of tomato one.
,,,,,"Otherwise, every dish was very tasty and we enjoyed them all."
,,,,,"The milk braised pork shoulder is one of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. Bone marrow is also a must, the presentation was incredible and makes for a fun food-sharing experience. At least 3-4 dishes for two people."
,,,,,"Being in town from LA for a work conference, I attempted to splurge on one big time dinner spot (that attempt failed, but that's another story) so after careful consideration opted to try this place. Upon showing up without reservation, I soon realized what the reviews said: one of the trendiest restaurants in Chicago's River North/Loop area. "
,,,,,"It's tucked away in a little corridor area between an overpass and a hotel. For a table of 2, I had to wait at 7:45pm for 45 minutes. However, there's a nice foyer area with heat lamps and chairs where one can enjoy a variety of drinks while you wait. And let me tell you, they have a MASSIVE selection. They are known for their pairing and they have a wine list from ALL over the world from prominent power house countries (France, wine country) to obscure cuts (like Bulgaria lol). I enjoyed a Spanish wine, which is my soft spot."
,,,,,"The ambiance in the restaurant is vibrant, and very tight quarters but it's done deliberately I feel. It's loud, especially inside but it's part of its charm and vibe. The waitress was incredibly kind and knowledgeable with the pairing of each wine and food item on the menu (appetizer or main dish). She was also incredibly understanding, as my coworker lagged for 40 minutes and I delayed the ordering process. "
,,,,,"The food is SPECTACULAR. I had the Housemade 'Nduja which was amazing. Paired perfectly with the grenache that they recommended, and portioned well. My main dish was the pork belly, and DEAR LORD. It was juicy, yet texturally sound with a crunch. The garnish of pickled carrots give it a tart sweetness to supplement the Smokey and meaty flavors. It was a hearty yet light dish, definitely the best pork belly I've ever had."
,,,,,"I ended up destroying my bank account with no regard for my finances by proceeding on a full scale food crawl of Chicago the following days but overall (decor, ambiance, service, food quality) this was my best stop in Chicago. HIGHLY recommended."
,,,,,"I make sure to stop by The Purple Pig anytime I'm in town. Unfortunately both times I've been there were in the winter lolol. However, their waiting area was actually very cute and cozy. My friends and I were seated at the bar both times. I'm going to highlight my second time there because it's more fresh in my memory. My boyfriend and I ordered four dishes and a desert to share. We definitely utilize some of your helpful reviews on here & the waitress's recs :)"
,,,,,"We ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears, Grilled Broccoli with Anchovy Vinaigrette, Pork Belly, Octopus a la Plancha, and Sicilian Iris. We LOVED the broccoli and octopus the most. It's a perfect balance of flavors: salty, tangy, full of umami. We really want to know how to make those broccoli ;) The Pig's ears dish was admittedly a bit underwhelming because it was the most hyped dish based on other reviews. It was still unique nevertheless and I would highly recommend trying it anyways. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. Finally, the desert (Sicilian iris) was really unique and rich. Overall, very satisfied with the food we got. "
,,,,,"Service was also wonderful. We were seated right in front of the cook and the head chef was literally standing next to us. It was definitely a wonderful experience! There's still a lot of dishes we wanted to try, so we will definitely be back. In the meantime, I would recommend for you to try it out. Definitely worth the wait & the hype, and if you go a bit earlier like 5pm, you'll be seated pretty fast."
,,,,,Great experience here at the purple pig.  I really enjoyed the food here and the wait time was around 20 minutes despite being told it would be around and hour.  Here's what we had :
,,,,,"Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers + Fried Egg - I liked how satisfying this was to eat with booze.  The fried kale was a nice touch."
,,,,,"Ribs - I thought this dish was inventive due to the use of balsalmic vinegar as a replacement for bbq sauce.  Given that, I'm still a bbq sauce kinda guy."
,,,,,Razor clams - The best dish I had at Purple pig.  The clams were sweet and dish was packed with flavor.
,,,,,"Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes + Salsa Verde - I enjoyed this dish.  The octopus was as tender as can be."
,,,,,All of these dishes were really good.  But I think I really like this place because they have a fantastic wine selection as well as really well made cocktails.  Ask me how many rye-whiskey Manhattans I had?  It was just that well-made.  
,,,,,"Braised pork shoulder: this was actually good and not salty like the other dishes. So I would recommend this dish. However, didn't justify the wait time. "
,,,,,"Btw, we were pretty hungry and they were already at an advantage since we probably would've thought anything was good at that point, but it wasn't. I  wouldn't go back again and wouldn't recommend this place. However, service was excellent and atmosphere was nice. If you want to try this place, go on an off hour. But with a lot of good food places around, I would recommend trying other places. Definitely not worth the wait."
,,,,,4 stars.
,,,,,Worth the wait!!
,,,,,"Although this place doesn't take reservations, we dropped by relatively early to put our names down and strolled around some shops. "
,,,,,"The food here was absolutely amazing. We ordered the crispy pig ears, pork shoulder, manchego cheese, cuttlefish, and the recommended ricotta/chocolate stuffed dessert. Everything was great, but the cuttlefish and manchego definitely stood out with unique flavors that just came together so well."
,,,,,Service was also great- we felt like family and even got free refills on our wine when we agreed to move down a table to make room for new guests. 
,,,,,I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Chicago :)
,,,,,"I ordered takeout through the Tock app and it's one of the best deals I've ever taken advantage of in Chicago. The order came with a salad (greens, beets, and asparagus), pasta with meat gravy, and chicken cacciatore. The flavors were all good but the real shocking part was just how much food we got for $20. It was literally enough for 6 comfortable meals (the two of us ate 3 separate times). It was a great opportunity to try Purple Pig food at very reasonable prices. I would definitely suggest you check out some of their to-go options if you get a chance!"
,,,,,One of the best meals I have had in years. Hands down. 
,,,,,Unbelievable food. 
,,,,,Great drink options. 
,,,,,Fantastic service. 
,,,,,My wife travels to Chicago for business on a regular basis. This restaurant has been on her list. I am so glad we took the time. 
,,,,,"We arrived at the Purple Pig at slightly before 2 on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was full (which, to me, is always a great sign early afternoon). We put our name on the waiting list and sat down outside. We had barely sat when a very helpful server (Alexander) offered us cocktails. Of course we obliged. Both of our choices were expertly crafted. We were off to a good start. "
,,,,,After an approximately 20 minute wait we sat down at a small table inside. Just walking from the front door to our table exposed us to dozens of mouth-watering plates. 
,,,,,"We ordered another round of drinks and decided to start with a combination of meats and cheeses. For meat we went with Blood Mortadella, Lingua and the Salumi. For cheese we went with the Grayson, a french triple creme and another that escapes me. We paired this with the marcona almonds in honey. Everything was simply superb. "
,,,,,"We then had the Crispy Pigs Ears. The pig is sliced thin and long and mixed with kale, peppers and topped with a fried egg. It is salty, crunchy, savory and everything that is right with the world."
,,,,,"We then had the Grilled Octopus. While this was my least favorite item, it was still quite good. The octopus is prepared with fingerling potatoes and green beans with a salsa verde. For me this was a texture thing. Most cooked octopus that I have had is charred, while this was seemingly sauteed. "
,,,,,"After switching to glasses of wine we ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. Dear sweet baby Jesus is this fantastic. The pork was preposterously tender - we barely touched it and it fell apart. Had it been more socially acceptable, I would have licked the plate. Utter perfection. "
,,,,,Overall it was an outstanding meal. I look forward to returning soon.
,,,,,"Reading about how long the wait could be, we decided to have an early dinner and arrived at The Purple Pig at 5 pm and were seated immediately. Despite the waiter mentioned their dishes were tapas style and meant to be shared, the portion size is not what you may think about tapas."
,,,,,"We ordered hummus, grilled broccoli, deviled egg, roasted cauliflower, seafood Saganaki and braised pork shoulder. They were all good but we preferred the veggies dishes which were all quite unique over the seafood and the pork. The seafood Saganaki was similar to bouillabaisse or cioppino in a tomato based sauce with Saganaki cheese cubes, not too special. The braised pork was a little dry."
,,,,,The place was definitely busy and service was good. It is definitely worth a try.
,,,,,Vibrant ambiance and good service. 
,,,,,"Ordered grilled octopus (way too salty and dry inside, and looks nothing like the website photo) but the purple yam was tasty. Bone marrow, HUGE, and yum. Hotdog, tasty but a bit too salty. Extensive wine list."
,,,,,This place is more like a 3-dollar-sign place. Had a glass of wine and 3 plates for over $120. 
,,,,,Will come back to try other items next time.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. We stopped here for lunch after our time at Millennium Park and Cloud Gate and we were NOT disappointed. The place was packed which just shows how great it is. Their dishes are high quality, the service is good, and it's great to sit outside on the patio when the weather is nice. There are individual tables but they have more communal tables which can be fun. "
,,,,,"We started out with some drinks and decided to go for a charcuterie board to start. You can have one cheese selection for $9, three cheeses for $24, and I believe 5 selections for $35. The meat choices are individually priced but you could get a whole platter for $50. We choose one of each type of cheese (gran pecorino, cremeaux di citeaux, and a mushroom cheese) and then two meats (prosciutto and spicy chorizo). Their meatballs are very popular here and we didn't get to try them because they ran out! Definitely will need to come back here. A true gem. "
,,,,,Instead we ordered the mussels that came with bits of chicken or turkey sausage - not sure. It was absolutely delicious and sufficient to share. 
,,,,,"Overall, this is definitely a place to go and if you have time, nothing wrong with going twice!"
,,,,,"Chicago has quite the food scene and it's easy to see why when you eat somewhere like the Purple Pig, a restaurant serving Mediterranean-inspired cuisine.  Its no secret that they serve up wildly delicious food because at lunch time it was bustling.  They don't take reservations so you might have to wait but it will be worth it.  I would also avoid coming here with a big group because the dining room is kind of small."
,,,,,Food here is served tapas style and if you are two I would recommend ordering 3 to 4 dishes.  My friend and I ordered 5 and it was a little much but we were just so tempted by what we saw on the menu.  The highlights for me were the milk braised pork shoulder and the ricotta gnocchi.  First off I loved the sauce that they served the gnocchi in and they were so light.  In my experience most restaurants make gnocchi too dense but the Purple Pig got it right.  Sadly we were too full to order dessert but believe me when I say I wanted to so badly.  
,,,,,One cool thing that they do here is that on the menu next to every item they suggest a wine pairing for the dish.  Having some guidance when trying to select which wine to order is always appreciated.  The wine list by the way is extensive and they have many options should you only wish to purchase a glass.
,,,,,Considering its prime location on Michigan Ave and the quality of the food I felt that the prices were reasonable.  Lunch for 2 was $100 and that included tip and a glass of wine.  My friend and I left feeling satisfied and full at the end of that.  If I were to find myself in Chicago again in the future I would most definitely make an effort to come back here.
,,,,,"At first I wasn't going to eat here because they said it would be a 2 to 3 hour wait. I thought to myself, forget this.  But my Wife convinced me to stay and we ended up at the bar right next to the grill; best thing that could've happened. "
,,,,,"We had the opportunity to watch as the staff worked together as a team, everyone being selfless, and the cooks having a great time preparing the meals for everyone. It was like watching a play. "
,,,,,"Now for the food: we had 3 of the cheeses, the salami with truffle butter, pickle and apricot jams, and a specialty mustard that were all fantastic!"
,,,,,I had the pork belly and tenderloin; it melted in my mouth. The Pork Belly + Tenderloin was seared and the fat was crisp in the outside and soft in the inside; cooked to perfection.  The tenderloin was so tender I could cut it with my fork. 
,,,,,"My beautiful Wife, who is almost always right , had the Orecchiette.  The pasta, sausage, and vegetables were cooked to perfection.  Everything was fresh and homemade.  "
,,,,,"Then there was desert. We shared the Sicilian Iris.  OMG... a pastry stuffed with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips, then deep fried and covered with powdered sugar; Superb!!! Definitely will be back and definitely recommend to anyone!!!"
,,,,,"My wife and I recently visited The Purple Pig for dinner. We tried a Cheese Selection, Crispy Pig's Ears, Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder, and Pork Belly. The Cheese Selection came out first with a trio of delicious cheeses. My favorite dish of the meal came out next, the Crispy Pig's Ears. Addictive strips of crisp and salty pig ears were packed with pork flavor, complimented by sweet peppers and flavorful kale, and topped with a yolky fried egg. The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder was a tender mound of pork shoulder which sat on creamy mashed potatoes. The Pork Belly was tender with a nice fattiness and topped with crisp radish slices and a sweet ginger glaze. The restaurant also has a large drink selection including an extensive selection of wines, spirits and a decent selection of local craft beer options."
,,,,,"Moved location but food is still great. Also more seating available. The bone marrow is to die for, a must get"
,,,,,I cannot recall a time I had a plate full of broccoli put in front of me and after the first bite I willingly decided that I could easily make myself sick from eating too much broccoli but that's the decision I'm facing. 
,,,,,"Yes, the smoked pork tongue was crazy delicious but this broccoli is out of this world! I would come here just for a plate of broccoli and a glass of wine. "
,,,,,The staff are crazy wonderful and the bartender knew his game. 
,,,,,Do it! Come here! Eat broccoli! And some pig!
,,,,,"Although the food is good, I feel that it wasn't worth the wait.  This is a tourist trap for sure.  I prefer a bit more upscale and intimate setting when dining out."
,,,,,"This place was so good I had tears in my eyes. I would highly recommend the bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, broccoli, smoked pork tongue, and the scallops. Each dish was amazing and showed astounding culinary talent; as a home chef I was amazed. The bone marrow was a perfect combination of grease, bread, herb, citrus, and salt. The broccoli was so suprisingly good and the scallops did not disappoint. The milk braised pork shoulder was the star of the night: the melt in your mouth meat combined perfectly with the mashed potatoes. The smoked pork tongue was good, and so was the lamb. You could tell the meat was very high quality. Overall, would definitely come here again, but the price tags are something to be careful of."
,,,,,Absolutely outstanding food here.
,,,,,The salt-roasted beets is a perfect starter. With whipped goat cheese and an amazing pistachio butter you will get an array of awesome flavors and textures.
,,,,,The chicken kebabs are unique. They use thigh meat instead of breast meat. The fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki that come with it perfectly rounds out the dish.
,,,,,We finished with the housemade meatballs with green garlic and toasted brioch. Lots and lots of flavor here. The meatballs were perfectly cooked.
,,,,,Nice beer and wine list. Service was great.
,,,,,We were lucky to get seated at the Purple Pig quickly as the place got way busier at 6 pm.
,,,,,"Following the yelpers, we started off with the bone marrow appetizer. It comes with buttered pieces of bread and you spread the bone marrow with salad and sea salt. It was unique and buttery. 4/5"
,,,,,"Next, we ordered the grilled octopus, which came with fingerling potatoes and green beans in a pesto sauce. The octopus was soft and had a slight charred crispiness from the grill. Delicious! 5/5"
,,,,,"My favorite was the milk braised pork shoulder. When they brought it out, I wondered where the knife was. But turns out, you don't need it, because the shoulder is so tender, it falls apart as you scoop it out withe a spoon with the mashed potatoes. 5/5"
,,,,,"Of course, even stuffed, we couldn't resist trying the Sicilian Iris dessert which is a lot like a donut with ricotta and chocolate inside. It's rich, but still tasted pretty good. "
,,,,,3/5
,,,,,"Service was decent, but the atmosphere is a little too loud and like a bar for me. A great place to try, if you want something unique!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,I know I am late to the game but I made it to The Purple Pig. I really enjoyed the food and the ambience. I wish I came here sooner. Definitely come here early because people line up before it even opens. Luckily we came right at 11:30a and didn't have to wait at all for a table. There are a decent amount of seats. A lot of communal seating for the larger groups and a lot of single tables for couples. We decided to sit inside and it was nice and cozy. I know it would be a great date spot for you looking for a date spot. 
,,,,,"Server helped us with some recommendations and we went with the beets, cauliflower, turkey leg, pork shoulder and the bone marrow. The beets were excellent. The pistachio sauce had a funny color but it was amazing. The flavor and the texture of the sauce was unexpected and memorable. The whipped goat cheese was smooth and it enhance the plate. The beets were perfectly cooked and not too crunchy and soft. I would highly recommend this dish. "
,,,,,"The cauliflower was good. The flavor was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The bone marrow was pretty good. I haven't seen a bone that big! It was nice to see and a really good portion. The herbs on top was nice and enhance the flavor. The bread was perfect, not to crunch and each to bite into. I would definitely get the bone marrow. The pork shoulder was great. Sooo soft and had the nice meat flavor. The mashed potatoes that came with it was like smooth and really blended. It was interesting. Last we had the turkey leg cooked in fat. It was amazing how the meat just fell off the bone. It was very tasty. I would recommend the shoulder over the turkey leg. "
,,,,,There is some street parking along Wabash if you are lucky. You can also do Spot hero. I was able to get a spot right across Eataly for 10 bucks. It's a nice short walk. The service was excellent and friendly.
,,,,,Customer service is great. The food is even better. If there were 6 stars I would've given it.
,,,,,"Overall: quality food, quality environment, unique taste. Do not pass on this if you're staying in Chicago. Portions are quite heavy and big for a tapas restaurant: 3 dishes is perfect for 2 people. "
,,,,,"I ordered the crispy pork ear, octopus, milk braised pork shoulder, and chicken skewers. Cooked very well - the meat was so tender I could pick it off easily with a fork, and the sauce and veggies that accompanied it had strong tastes but didn't overwhelm the main part of the dish. The crispy pork ear was alright - I personally believe it was too fried, which made it honestly taste like nothing more than fancy potato chips. Maybe that's your thing, but especially compared to the flavors of the pork shoulder and the chicken skewers, it was nothing to write home about. "
,,,,,"tl;dr: must go. Meat insanely tender, dishes overall flow well. Great service, great ambience. There's a reason this place has so many reviews and is so popular!"
,,,,,Have to come back for the salt roasted beets.
,,,,,"Salt Roasted Beets - 5/5. Perfect. Pistachio butter is the star of the delicious. Great beets, nice dabs of goat cheese. "
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - 4/5. Melt in your mouth pork flavor. Very nice mashed potatoes. Good but doesn't quite live up to the hype.
,,,,,Lamb Ribs - 3/5. Dish just didn't really work. The lamb didn't have that fall off the bone feel. The supportive flavors were meh.
,,,,,"Unbelievable experience! I didn't know much about this place before arriving in Chicago, other than it was highly rated... then to find out how popular this place apparently is and that it is a Jimmy Bannos, Jr. restaurant. Tucked away in an office building on the Magnificent Mile, this venue promotes ""Cheese, Swine & Wine"". Although we had no wine from their grand selection, there were wine pairings with almost every item on the menu.  The exotic menu, itself, was a good size, neither too large nor too small.  Having already looked at the menu prior to arriving, I was intrigued and excited about trying out certain items. I was not once disappointed. In fact, It was amazing from beginning to end. "
,,,,,"Our wait time to be seated was less than a couple minutes, and our server arrived promptly at our table for our drink order. During our meal, we were then greeted by another server, Corie, who engaged with our table very well and even offered some great recommendations. She was very friendly, always had a smile on her face, and made the entire experience that much better."
,,,,,"Our first course that arrived was the Whipped Feta. Not knowing what exactly would show up at our table, it was a beautiful display of complex flavors, which included four pillows of light tasty feta, topped by wild greens, which was a wonderful addition for texture, and drops of puréed dates.  The entire appetizer (""Snack"") was wonderful and beautifully presented."
,,,,,"Then arrived what might be the most surprising course of the entire meal... the Grilled Broccoli.  Recommended immediately by our server when prompted, it was, quite simply, one of the most life-changing experiences I've ever had with a vegetable. In fact, it might have ruined broccoli for me forever if I have to have broccoli prepared any other way. It was warm, slightly charred, slightly drizzled in an unbelievable Anchovie Vinagrette, and topped with what were clearly some type of magic breadcrumbs for texture. It was, simply, unforgettable. My only regret was that it came out very early near the same time as the Whipped Feta and it took every ounce of discipline to not devour the entire plate before the main courses arrived, so it was near room temperature by that time."
,,,,,"The first main course that arrived was the Wagyu Steak and artichokes. They were accompanied by a dollop of caramelized onions, and fava beans.  The steak portion, prepared medium-rare, was sliced and also slightly blanketed with an accompanying sauce. From the first bite to the last, it was absolutely wonderful. In fact, tender enough to slice with a butter knife."
,,,,,"The last course to arrive was the Pork Belly and tenderloin. Three slices of pork tenderloin topped with carrot strings, radish shavings, and an absolutely wonderful Ginger Carrot sauce - and all sitting atop a bed of almost-candied 1/2 inch slice of pork belly that I will never forget. It was beyond even my grand expectations -  from the first bite to the last."
,,,,,"Overall, despite the number at the bottom of the final bill, the meal was unforgettable. I'll be talking about the broccoli for years to come and comparing this experience to the best I've ever had. In fact, I may stop in again before I leave Chicago!"
,,,,,"This is my third time here and it's becoming a Chicago tradition every time I visit downtown.  I love the cool vibe, the communal tables and the friendly staff.  There is usually a wait but if you get lucky sometimes you can get a spot by the bar. "
,,,,,"This time we actually had reservations for a different restaurant and just dropped in for a drink.  The bartender was super helpful and we both enjoyed our choices. My sister had a cocktail and I enjoyed a smooth Malbec from Argentina. I always end up striking up conversations with other patrons here because the food is so interesting, so everyone wants to share and discuss. "
,,,,,Our neighbors cheese plate inspired us to order the same and we also opted for their world famous (it should be) bone marrow appetizer. The bone marrow is buttery perfection served with toasted bread and a refreshing  cilantro salad. I obviously spoiled my dinner and consumed way too many calories but it was worth every bite.
,,,,,"Ok, I am in LOVE with the Purple Pig! Situated in the heart of downtown, the Purple Pig boasts a fabulous tapas-style menu. While they take no reservations and can subject their guests to quite a wait. Miraculously, at 5pm on a Thursday, my sister and I were able to be seated right away."
,,,,,The Purple Pig offers communal seating and is a hot spot for tourists. Everyone at my table was very nice and friendly and chatted with us for a bit. 
,,,,,"I had an old fashioned to drink, which was definitely on the strong side, but no complaints here. My favorite dish was the sweet potato polenta because the blend of flavors was sheer nirvana. The milk-braised pork shoulder is also fantastic and basically falls apart as soon as you dive in. I did order the broccoli but thought the portion was way too big in comparison to the sizes of the other dishes. Definite broccoli overkill--I'd try the beets next time. The desserts are all pretty darn godly. Looking forward to my next visit!"
,,,,,I was super excited to try The Purple Pig for lunch and I was mostly impressed! I got to the restaurant about 10 minutes before they opened to ensure that I would get seated.
,,,,,"The Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad and Sicilian Sea Salt was delicious without being too greasy. The large bone was served with several pieces of thick crunchy bread, some greens, and sea salt. A spoonful of that bone marrow with that bread, and I was in heaven! We were basically fighting over the last pieces of that bone marrow!"
,,,,,"The Fava Bean Spread was pretty average. A few pieces of bread with some spread, which basically tasted like hummus. I would not get again."
,,,,,"Crispy Pig's Ears wasn't my favorite dish. I thought the entire dish was too greasy, but I did enjoy the blend of veggies (kale and peppers), along with the perfectly fried runny egg. I would not get again."
,,,,,"The Grilled Octopus came with Fingerling Potatoes, Green Beans and Salsa Verde. The octopus was super tender and perfectly cooked, though the entire dish was too salty. All of the individual components were salty, as was the Salsa Verde, which made everything too salty."
,,,,,"The Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Puffed Farro was absolutely incredible! The meat was so tender and basically fell apart in my mouth. As a lover of mashed potatoes, I was happy that these were creamy and not lumpy."
,,,,,"I'm generally not a big fan of desserts but knew I had to try the Sicilian Iris, which was a fried donut stuffed with ricotta and chocolate chips. Cutting open the dessert was glorious, and the taste matched the appearance just as well. I loved how creamy the filling was without being too sweet."
,,,,,"Purple Pig is so close to 5 stars for me, but some of the dishes were just too salty and oily for my liking. I would definitely come back for the Pork Shoulder and Bone Marrow!"
,,,,,"This restaurant is outstanding!! The service is good. The food is excellent. I had the squid ink pasta that was spicy, yummy and excellent. It was perfectly balanced with a glass of the Janis Picpoul. My husband  had the pork shoulder which was melt in your mouth . The appetizer was excellent - The bufala mozzarella and for desert bread pudding. Everything was spectacular. We be back next time we are in Chicago"
,,,,,"Went for a date night,Food was amazing! Great wait staff. Definitely will be back again."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Came across this place on Yelp and saw it had many reviews and the name was pretty cute so we decided to come for dinner. Our friend said this place was good but quite pricey but we still wanted to give it a try. There were plenty of seating outside and inside. So we chose to sit inside. 
,,,,,"We decided to order the roasted bone marrow ($18), Cavatelli Pasta ($14), Milk Braised Pork Shoulder ($19), and 1 selection of the Brigante al Tartufo cheese platter ($8). "
,,,,,"The roasted bone marrow was probably the best dish that we ordered. It was recommended by our friend and definitely enjoyed it. It came with some baguettes and arugula. The pasta was probably the most unexpected dish. It was basically ravioli wrapped with a goat cheese filling. The goat cheese was overpowering and extremely creamy. It was definitely one of the worst dish that we had. The pork shoulder also took forever to come out. We were done with our dishes and the pork shoulder was still not out yet. The pork was alright. It was a bit dried but paired with the mashed potatoes, it was manageable. Lastly, the cheese platter was great! The cheese was light and refreshing. It came with some cracker bites and jelly. The combination was to die for! "
,,,,,"Overall, I would recommend the bone marrow and the cheese platter. The pasta was the worst dish we had. And the pork shoulder was just alright. We were looking forward to our experience here and it just didn't meet our expectations. Our waiter also wasn't very nice. He seemed too cool to answer our questions and seemed to smirk a lot when taking our order."
,,,,,"First to review Pandemic Purple Pig? Gladly! They are offering curbside pickup or delivery through the Tock app. You can also order wine in the app too. Curbside pickup was super fast as Nick ran out with the food as I was pulling up on Michigan Ave. Chef Jimmy's Italian Feast includes a mixed green salad with beets and asparagus, rigatoni with pork neckbone Sunday gravy, and Jimmy's chicken cacciatore. As you can see from my picture, this was truly a feast for 2! The salad was crisp, and the beets were amazing. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly, but that shredded pork sauce/gravy was out of this world. The chicken cacciatore was rustic and delicious. This is a great way to support your local restaurants during this pandemic. This meal was seriously the best takeout food I've ever eaten!"
,,,,,"First off, this place is an office building. I walked back-and-forth for quite a bit before I saw a small stenciled sign on a window that said Purple Pig. I sat at the bar, since I was by myself. It was a Sunday afternoon and they were busier than I would have expected. I looked at the menu and wanted to try the gazpacho salad. When I asked about how big the salad was, the bartender said it was  small to medium salad, so I thought I would grab something else. He recommended the scallops. Ok, way too much food, but very good. Love the salad, but a little over-dressed. The scallops were cooked to perfection. A bit on the pricey side, but it is Chicago. Great wine list and lots of G&T concoctions that I would love to try!!! Will be back!"
,,,,,"Not my style. Expensive, hard to get to location without a great ambiance  and the menu items aren't appealing to me. I think you could find better for the price."
,,,,,We went on a Monday during lunch (around noon-ish) and got in right away. Very special place and very interesting menu.
,,,,,Some of our favorites were (as shown in order by photos):
,,,,,1. 10 year aged cheddar & duck prosciutto 
,,,,,2. Pig ear 
,,,,,3. Pig tongue
,,,,,4. The bone marrow
,,,,,5. Milk-braised Pork shoulder with mashed potato
,,,,,Beautifully designed place too.
,,,,,"Friday night, super busy. Luckily we got in right away, as we just a party of two (i.e., dont let the line of people waiting scare you,  if you have a small party maybe there is an open table). "
,,,,,"First time there, we ordered summer squash ($16), the grilled sardines ($15), and the english muffin/truffle sausage ($16).  The sardines and the muffin sausage were super excellent, but sadly the summer squash was a bit bland and pededstrian. Smaller portions, btw.  The wine selection seemed pretty good, but i was in no mood to drink, I wanted to focus on the food.  Wait staff were super helpful and professional.  For sure would return."
,,,,,"Great place for a casual sit down or a night out with friends! The food is absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. The style here is small plates and shareables so you get plenty of variety through out your meal. Our server was occasionally a little difficult to get ahold of, but they also were absolutely packed so that makes sense. "
,,,,,The only negative that I can say about this place involves the front of house and their quoted wait times. This is the second visit in a row that has been quoted at an hour wait and we've been seated in less than 10 minutes. To me this is a negative because it means they don't have a handle on the system and if it flips the other way it will lead to a great deal of upset patrons. 
,,,,,"When it comes to the food, we ordered everything from cocktails to dessert and it was all exceptional. Their cocktails are balanced and well thought out. Some of them are unique creations, others are variations in classics but all of them are delicious. "
,,,,,For food we ran through a bunch of items on the menu. The top was absolutely the bone marrow... what made this dish stand out was not the perfectly cooked bone but the bright citrus and parsley side with capers and onions. It brought a wonderful brightness to a traditionally rich and heavy dish. 
,,,,,"Desserts were also wonderfully creative and well thought out. They had many different layers of flavor but also texturally they were quite different and well executed. Only down side is they do rub out so if you're really set on something for dessert, get there early!"
,,,,,The purple pig is a top notch place off Michigan that specializes in pork of course good selections of entrees and I highly recommend there pigs ear also there fine wine list

,,,,,"Way overrated for food and ambience. Feels like eating in a cafeteria  with the service to match.Food expensive and the portions are small.( One oz or less  bone marrow -$25). Pig ear is deep fried and taste like cicerone.Pig tongue -nothing special - Tastes like corned beef or pastrami.Small portions of food should come with small price.Calling it ""Tapa style "" is just a fancy way to overcharge, No plan to return."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Tried most of popular dishes; pig ear, milk braised shoulder, octopus and felt extremely UNDERWHELMED.  Pig ear crispy tastes like chips but missing taste.  Milk braised shoulder meat is like mom's pressure cooker quality and on the salty side.  Octopus is slightly undercooked. "
,,,,,"Overall, taste/texture unimpressive. If there's lineup for this place , I would recommend try other places."
,,,,,Love both the atmosphere and the food.
,,,,,- Food: I came alone here twice when traveling to Chicago. Their food is tasty and delicious. The presentation is also excellent. I'm personally satisfied with the portion and price. 
,,,,,- Atmosphere: This place has modern look. It's more upscale than the average but you wont feel too formal over here. The restaurant is vibrant . The noise is neither too loud nor too quiet.
,,,,,"I love The Purple Pig. I love this place so much that I still wear their souvenir t-shirt to sleep when I bought it five years ago during my first visit to Chicago. Although the server waiting on us could have been better at acting like he wanted to be there, and they could have opened their door a few minutes early especially when they can see a few of us were literally standing in the torrential downpour, I'll excuse their behavior because their food was that good. Below is the breakdown of our order:"
,,,,,"- Beef Tendon Chips: 5/5; strong salt and vinegar dusting made chicharron-style. So, so good!"
,,,,,- Grilled Broccoli: 5/5; light and creamy anchovy vinaigrette really brightened up this dish.
,,,,,-Neck Bone Gravy: 5/5; tasty meat sauce with creamy ricotta served with toasted bread.
,,,,,"-Grilled Octopus: 4/5; love the salsa verde and crunch of the green beans, but we preferred the firmer part of the tentacles versus the spongier part of the body that was served. Just a personal preference I suppose."
,,,,,"This place gave me a foodgasm! The service was good, the decor and ambiance also good, and the food was incredibly good. Every plate we tried was cooked and presented masterfully and the taste- memorable. It's no wonder they have so many positive reviews- If you're in town and want good food and pleasant experience I highly recommend you check this place out!"
,,,,,"If you must have a Chicago dog during your visit to the Windy cities, make it the homemade hot dog at the Purple Pig.  I  am going to take it a step further and say it is the best hotdog I've ever tasted!  Served on a delicious homemade roll finished off with a truffle butter and accompanied by excellent smashed/fried potato's it was beyond compare."
,,,,,There for lunch we enjoyed a cheese and charcuterie plate and a tremendous grilled Kohlrabi salad.  I will be going home and Grilling more vegetables
,,,,,"The wine list is superb, the staff excellent and Chef Jimmy Bannos sitting next to us made it a special lunch."
,,,,,"This is the #1 recommended must go to restaurant every time I mention to someone from my hometown that I'm going to Chicago. For the past three recent trips, I've been wanting to make my way here to see what is all the hype about and  this time, I finally got to find out. Let me tell you, The Purple Pig has lived up to that hype and so much more. We came with great expectations and excited to say that we left being so satisfied that I am now one of those people that can't stop and won't stop recommending the next visitors to the Windy City to come here. Even on a Friday night, packed out, they made sure we were kept 6 ft. distanced away from other parties so that is very much appreciated in a time like this. My favorites were just about everything we ordered, can't think of one thing we did not like... From the crispy duck, to the melt in your mouth pork belly, tasty little charcuterie board, and the unforgettable buttery bone marrow, it was all so delicious! Possibly some of the best dishes I've ever had."
,,,,,"The service and staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, seated us quickly  and met our many requests. IE bought drinks for another group and celebrated with ""new"" friends on their anniversary. The food was exceptional, the presentation wonderful.., a go to place for fun and great service and food."
,,,,,This is a hot spot for tourists and we were lucky to be seated right away at a community table with other strangers. The restuarant is located right next to the river with lovely views from where I sat on the patio. Service was good.
,,,,,"We decided on the grilled octopus (my personal favorite!), turkey leg confit, and grilled broccoli. The octopus was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. It was paired with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. The broccoli was really tasty because of the anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic, and toasted bread crumbs on top. Such a unique and exquisite way to eat broccoli! The turkey leg was probably the only item that didn't wow me as because it didn't seem much different than the turkey leg I can get at a fair. It was drenched in a sweet sauce, topped with lentils and came with bed of cabbage. I like the tapas style of this restaurant and there are other items on the menu I'd come back to try like the roasted bone marrow."
,,,,,"Interior - Cute, cramped, warm. Patio seating is warmed up also."
,,,,,"Service - Slow, took several requests for water and refills to get anyone's attention, all seemed annoyed and ignored us every now and then. "
,,,,,Wait time - Last party to get seated on Friday at12:20PM before the restaurant was entirely filled up. 
,,,,,"Grilled octopus (fingerling potatoes, green beans, salsa verde) - Best item. Octopus was very soft, fluffy, and light. The dish was oily and salty. "
,,,,,"Crispy pig's ears (kale, pickled cherry peppers and fried egg) - Also greasy. The kale chips were salty and delicious. Best kale chips I've had. Pig ears are crispy and salty. "
,,,,,"Salt-roasted beats (whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter) - Generous portion, delicious thick pistachio butter. Combination worked well. Again, rich and salty. "
,,,,,Chicken thigh kebabs (fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki) - Can't get any saltier than this. The chicken was average. The potatoes and tzatziki sauce is interesting but didn't work so great for me.
,,,,,"The Purple Pig has been a longtime favorite spot of mine and after many years it continues to impress. In fact, my latest visit was my best yet. I went here for lunch with a group of four and we split a bottle of rosé, and one order of the salt-roasted beets, whipped feta, chicken thigh kebabs, and octopus. It was the perfect amount for four people, and we were all silent when the food it the table because we were so busy eating. Though we thoroughly enjoyed each dish, the table favorite was the Chicken Thigh Kebabs - the combo of the crispy smashed potatoes, and deliciously creamy Tzatziki sauce was to die for. "
,,,,,"This is a GREAT spot to share small plates with friends, just arrive early and plan to wait for a table - they do the whole ""we'll text you when we're ready"" deal so you can shop while you wait for your turn."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,I think this is my 3rd visit here - and it was definitely my favorite visit! Maybe it's because we had expert guides with us this time ;)
,,,,,So we were stuffing our faces in Chicago and didn't have space for the charcuterie and cheese... but next time right?
,,,,,"We went with the fancy Egg Muffin (so good!), the Whipped Feta (fancy looking!), the broccoli (nothing special here), and the braised pork shoulder (terrific!). Simply put, everything was super good - and can't wait to come back :)"
,,,,,"Came recently with the BF on a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We probably waited around 20-30 minutes in total. They texted us when our table was ready, so we were able to spend the time walking around Michigan Ave. I remember when we came 3 years ago, we had to wait FOREVER. So the lesson is: come earlier if possible!"
,,,,,"The waiter recommended 3-4 dishes for two people, but I would recommend 4-5 dishes if you want to feel more full. The BF and I decided to have whatever sounded good rather than what everyone else gets. I enjoyed my food much more than during my previous visit, so I guess the strategy worked. They seem to rotate out their menu items but the following two things that we had are still available:"
,,,,,Eggplant caponata -- lovely flavors and amazing bread. My critique would be that there was a bit too much of the caponata topping so it weighed down the dish.
,,,,,Milk braised Berkshire shoulder -- delicious though slightly salty for me (BF didn't have a problem with it and it was his favorite dish)
,,,,,My personal favorites were a quail egg ravioli and a steak dish (not sure if it's Bavette Steak). We also got a roasted caulilini that was yummy. I hope they rotate those back in on the menu!
,,,,,"In conclusion, I would happily come back to the Purple Pig and you should too. If you want to visit, though, prepare to go early or wait a long time."
,,,,,"Wasn't sure if this place was a tourist trap or actually had legit food! Stopped in on a Monday afternoon around 3 pm. It was bustling with tourists but we were able to be seated right away with a party of two. We went for a few of the yelp highlights: bone marrow, octopus and pork shoulder. The food did not disappoint!! The bone marrow was a generous portion with a side of perfectly toasted bread, herbs and capers and salt. They even provided us with extra bread after we ran out! "
,,,,,The octopus was perfectly cooked with a soft texture on the inside and slight char on the outside. It was served with green beans tossed in a pesto sauce. The pork shoulder was amazing! The pork was incredibly soft and tender and just fell apart as we ate it. It was served on top of the creamiest mashed potatoes! 
,,,,,"Overall a solid choice but definitely popular with tourists, but for good reason."
,,,,,"Came here on a Monday during lunch and got lucky with no wait because I found seating at the bar. Even at 2pm this place was crazy packed. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the amazing aromas because of the open kitchen layout. "
,,,,,"FOOD IS AMAZING. I highly recommend fried pig ears salad, turkey leg confit, and spare ribs. All three dishes were soooo flavorful. Portions are also huge! Definitely get a bang for your buck here. Bartenders were very attentive even though it was crowded at the bar area. "
,,,,,"If I ever come back to Chicago, this would be my top pick. I highly recommend you try this place. Even if it seems packed, put your name down on the waiting list, go exploring around the area and come back! The food is worth the wait."
,,,,,"Let me start by saying the food is really good. The service at least due to our server, Heriberto, was abhorrent. Rude doesn't begin to describe him. He rushed us through ordering drinks and appetizers. Then we didn't see him for a long time to order our dinner. Once again rushed us through ordering. For example, as he went to each person to get their order, dare we pause for a thought because good ol' Heriberto didn't skip a breath to ask, "" Do you need me to come back?"" He asked every single one of us this. "
,,,,,"Then I ordered a glass of wine and about 10 minutes later he brought it by and sat, more like flung it before someone else. He dropped it off so fast I don't know how the glass didn't tip over. "
,,,,,"Then, as different servers brought our individual plates they just places them in the center of the table not caring to state what it was they were dropping off so we knew who it went to. For the price you'd think you'd get better service. Though the foos was good, the service was so bad it left a nasty taste in my mouth."
,,,,,Great food and awesome service.  Corn salad simple but so fresh and delicious.  Beef tongue was stellar just maybe a little lighyrt on the mayo in the macaroni salad.
,,,,,"At 10pm on a Wednesday, the Purple Pig was still bumpin. The ambience is fun and lively.  The menu is drool worthy and it was hard picking an entree. I had the pork belly and tenderloin with a ginger glaze, carrot and espresso, and boy, was it good! One of biggest slices of pork belly I've ever had served with 5 slices of tenderloin. It was beautifully plated and absolutely delicious. My friend had the milk braised berkshire shoulder, and was equally satisfied. The wine pairing suggestions are also a nice touch. Can't wait for the next time I'm back in Chicago to try more dishes!"
,,,,,We ordered the tuna tartar and the turkey leg as well as goat cheesecake and they were delicious! The tuna tartar was the best I've ever had. The turkey leg was so juicy and tender and it came off the bone so easily - it was just a bit too oily for us but it was still quite flavorful. This is the first goat cheesecake I've had and I absolutely loved it - it went perfectly with the ice cream; soooo yummy!
,,,,,"So really this is a 4.5 but I have to give them 5 stars as it's Jeremy C's fave place in the city.  Food here has been consistently excellent, we often recommend this place for out of town guests, partly because of the excellent location. It's on Michigan Ave, not far from the Chicago River, and you can walk to Millenium park if you're up for it."
,,,,,"There's no parking, I'd recommend spothero if you're driving, there's a few underground garages nearby. Otherwise Uber/Lyft/Taxi or use public transport."
,,,,,"Onto the food!  The menu is constantly changing but one dish we ALWAYS order is the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with smashed fried potatoes and tzatziki.  So much yumminess!  Their veggies are also surprisingly good, and the grilled octopus we had the last time we went was also very tasty. Food is served tapas style, so it's technically smaller, shared plates, but priced a little higher than typical tapas.but it's so good it's worth it!"
,,,,,"It can get very busy, with a wait.  And they have both outdoor and indoor seating available.  You may find yourself squeezing into a table with other people.  It's definitely an experience!"
,,,,,"Anyways, come here, enjoy the food, and then take a walk and enjoy the sights of downtown Chicago."
,,,,,"Omg,  this restaurant is the bomb.  I ate here during 2015 during October and the food and service was off the chain!!!!!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"My nth visit to this place and ofcourse it never disappoints. The news things I tried this time around were broccoli - fantastic, crispy and slightly. And their version of Foie gras, it was pan seared, surrounded by a delicious almond butter layer and nuts. The combination of flavors was superb!"
,,,,,"So came back here, cause why wouldn't you if you've tried it once. "
,,,,,"Tried the pork shoulder, beet salad and gnocchi in their infamous neck one gravy this time."
,,,,,My favorite was the beet salad. We got half a bottle of a red wine that our server recommended.
,,,,,Love coming back here. My absolute favorite place in Chicago
,,,,,One of the places you have to go to if in Chicago. Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations and there's always a huge queue outside. However definitely worth the wait
,,,,,"We got the cauliflower, mind blowing my delicious "
,,,,,"Octopus- all right, was prepared in pesto sauce"
,,,,,Pork belly- to die for
,,,,,Gnocchi - delicious
,,,,,"We also got a dessert that delicious, unfortunately I can't recollect the name"
,,,,,Their wine collection is pretty exhaustive too and the servers are well informed to guide you into getting a good bottle.
,,,,,"We got a bottle Hedges Red mountain vintage wine, that paired well with our food."
,,,,,"All in all, a great dining experience"
,,,,,"When I told my friends I was visiting Chicago they ALL recommended The Purple Pig and now I know why. I would've probably enjoyed it more if I ate red meat, but even their vegetarian options were so tasty!"
,,,,,"As expected, the food is dElicious. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The pork shoulder is a definite. It's so flavorful and tender and juicy and amazing. "
,,,,,Getting here early is a must. We came here about 15-20 min before the restaurant opened and we were apart of the first batch of customers.
,,,,,"The 6000 Yelp reviews are what brought us in to dine at The Purple Pig. Although they claim to be tapa style dishes, the portions are big and one dish can definitely satisfy one person. I got the sweet corn polenta (they seem to switch up the vegetable for the polenta depending on what's in season). The flavours were great and everything complimented one another very well. The cherry tomatoes were the sweetest and freshest tomatoes I've ever eaten! The grapefruit purée was really overpowering, which was the only downside to the dish. I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because I think the price is a bit much considering the taste of the food: great, but not worth the price point associated with it."
,,,,,"If you're coming during peak times, be prepared to wait! We put our name down and our wait was supposed to be 1-1:15 hours. The wait was cut a bit short because we indicated that we don't mind sitting outside. Although the wait was long, the service did not disappoint. We had a super bubbly waiter, and he was really helpful with walking me through the vegetarian options on the menu. The atmosphere is also very cozy at night, with dim fairy lights strung around the patio."
,,,,,"Verdict: You should definitely check this place out, if only to be able to say that you did. Worth the first trip, not sure if it's worth further trips after that."
,,,,,"With 6,000 reviews and a 4/5 rating I thought my experience at The Purple Pig would be much more satisfying than it turned out to be. Don't get me wrong my meal was good, but it's not worth it to wait for a long time since they don't take reservations. If I lived in Chicago and recommending friends on where to eat in a short amount of time, this would not be in the top 5 places to eat..."
,,,,,"The place is super cramped everywhere. We walked in around 5pm on a weekday and got seated in 15ish minutes. They have several large communal tables, seating at the bar, and regular tables. We got seated in front of the kitchen area/bar because those were the only seats left. Pretty cramped and loud but it was fun to see the chefs making the food. "
,,,,,"My friend and I ordered 2 cocktails off of the menu. She ordered a basic Old Fashioned and I ordered a House Cocktail (can't remember the name of it but it was vodka based). Our drinks were pretty standard in taste, and the presentation was nice but one of the main reasons why I gave The Purple Pig 3/5 is that if I'm paying $14+ for a drink I expect more than half of my glassware to have liquid in it. The large ice cube they put in my cocktail literally made up half of my drink (see picture). I was pretty shocked because I've never ordered a cocktail where most of it was just pure ice."
,,,,,***The menu changes pretty often and I believe the menu I ordered off of back in June has already changed*** Most of the dishes are 'tapas style' so the waiter recommended we ordered 2 dishes each.
,,,,,"We ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow (3.5/5 one of my friends favorite dishes and she said this was just standard- but the portion was very large), Roasted Pineapple (4/5 pretty interesting flavors), Asparagus (5/5 the best thing I ate here, it tasted like pasta but the whole dish was just tiny cut up asparagus), and the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder (5/5 the meat melted in your mouth and the mashed potatoes were delicious)."
,,,,,"Came here for lunch. Good service and fabulous dishes. The wait was about an hour or so, but worth it. The restaurant is casual and gets really crowded. "
,,,,,"French, Spanish, American, European inspired fusion creations....we were impressed and satisfied. "
,,,,,"We ordered the Spanish Octopus, Greek Salad, Calamari, Milk Braised pork shoulder w/mashed potatoes, Fava beans-hard boiled eggs-leeks-crispy prosciutto, the Crispy pig ears (with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, fried egg), Roasted Bone Marrow, Scallop Spiedini, Foie gras & membrillo, and the Salt Roasted beets."
,,,,,"Sooo hard to decide which dishes were my favorites. I pretty much enjoyed them all. If I had to pick, well...the milk braised pork shoulder was especially memorable. Had a great time here-what a gastronomical experience with great friends!! Would definitely come back when I get the chance!!"
,,,,,"So so delicious! They open at 11:30 on the weekends. We got there at 11:20 and there was already a bit of a line. Right at 11:30, they started to seat people. I was so impressed by the organization. They had waiters lined up ready to sit people!!"
,,,,,"The staff was nice, a little slow to come around and check on you. We ordered the pig ears, the broccoli and then cheese/meat. All were exceptional. "
,,,,,"I was nervous to taste the pig ears but I actually really liked it! They had a macaroni salad in the middle of the two pieces which really balanced the flavor. On to the broccoli, this was soooo good. The sauce on top was something that I'd never tasted before. The broccoli was also charred which gave it such a great flavor. "
,,,,,Definitely will be back next time I'm in town!
,,,,,Purple Pig is adorable! Good fun drink spot but also great food/shareables! I had the Cava sparkling wine (so good) and the Tuna Tartare and I would definitely recommend. Our waiter was very nice and helpful.
,,,,,"Literally my family's favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Whenever they're in town, they make sure to get a hotel nearby so they don't have to walk far to eat here. Be warned, even before they open on the weekdays, a line forms, so be prepared to come early or wait a bit."
,,,,,"There are a couple must-have dishes in my opinion. They are the Pig's Ear, the Pork Shoulder, and the Charred Cauliflower. The ear is a crispy appetizer with just a bit of juice and flavor per piece that every single bite is packed with tasty goodness."
,,,,,"The pork shoulder is my personal favorite entree. The sauce it comes with and the tenderness of the pork is really something you should try. Finally, I'm not a big vegetable person but the cauliflower is a must try."
,,,,,"The style of this restaurant is family-style so be prepared to fight your siblings or significant other for the last bite. I've always ordered a lot when I come here, and just a quick tip. As shown by the name, they specialize in pork dishes. I am a red meat fan all the way but the pork dishes here are far superior."
,,,,,Awesome restaurant!
,,,,,"Pros: delicious flavors for food, great menu, good service, and overall lovely atmosphere, the bread you can ask for with the food is so yummy. "
,,,,,"Cons: slightly pricey for the amount of food served, presentation could be somewhat improved"
,,,,,"Loved the place, definitely worth a visit"

,,,,,"The daughter suggested the Purple Pig for dinner. Purple Pig? The name brings to mind the, ""Pork. The Other White Meat."" advertising slogan from the mid 1980's. It makes me think that things may not have turned out the same with, ""Pork. The Other Purple Meat."" In advertising, tag lines are important. Just sayin."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig sits toward the back of the lobby of 444 Michigan Avenue. We arrived and were greeted by two friendly individuals who informed us the wait for a table was about 90 minutes. Undaunted, we put our names in and went for a walk outside. It was a beautiful night and we had a little time on our hands. Returning a little over an hour later we sat in the lobby outside the front door of the restaurant waiting patiently for our name to be called. When it was our turn we were directed through the restaurant toward the rear of the dining room. The combination of wood and decorative tile in the bar area was charming. We studied the menu and decided on the Whipped Feta, Grilled Broccoli, Eggplant Caponata, Hamachi Collar, and Burrata Cannoli. For dessert we chose the Pink Guava with Formage Blanc and the Raspberry Tart. The whipped feta was excellent with the whipped feta teamed up with heirloom tomatoes, honey, and cumin served with pita crackers. Yum! Plenty for the four of us to share. The grilled broccoli was the favorite dish of the ones we ordered. The brocolli was grilled to a perfect consistency and combined with roasted garlic, bread crumbs, and an anchovy vinaigrette that was superb. We all loved this dish with its garlicky anchovy goodness. The eggplant caponata was marvelous with the grilled bread topped with goat cheese and then layered with the eggplant, chick pea, celery, tomato, and herb combination. A really nice rendition of this traditional Sicilian dish. The hamachi collar was a first for several of us. It was served with yellow tomato BBQ and romesco and sweet pepper salpicon. The meat was exceptionally tender and flavorful and accented nicely with the sauces. The burrata cannoli had a crisp pastry shell filled with the burrata and surrounded with apricots, olive caramel, and heirloom tomatoes. A delightful dish to finish our dinner with the light pastry shell cracking to reveal the delicious burrata inside. Our deserts to follow were equally special. The pink guava and formage blanc was a luscious guava sorbet surrounded by thrilling sweet accents. The raspberry tart was the raspberriest! A refreshingly satisfying end to a truly memorable dinner. This was a genius recommendation by the daughter. Next time we are in Chicago, the Purple Pig will be high on our list of places to visit so that we can try more of the tempting items on the menu."
,,,,,"Amazing! We were recommended that 3 dishes would be a good amount for two people and we weren't disappointed. We ordered the crispy pig ear, scallops, and pork belly + tenderloin. Everything we ate was simply delicious! "
,,,,,The crispy pig ear had a really nice crunch to it while they balanced the salty flavors really well with the peppers.
,,,,,"The scallops was so soft and delicious, easily some of the best scallops I've ever had. I really liked the creamy corn sauce that paired with it although there was some pickled baby corn in there that was so sour it was kind of jarring."
,,,,,"Then there's the pork belly and tenderloin. I think this was my favorite dish there. The pork belly by itself was so tender and full of flavors I wasn't sure if it needed the tenderloin. Then I ate them together. I honestly had to let everything settle for a minute after I ate it, wanted to savor every bite. The tenderloin by itself isn't impressive but together the texture works so well with how soft the pork belly is."
,,,,,Totally worth the wait (ours was like 30 mins) if you ask me. A total must in Chicago!
,,,,,"Went back with Brian and have all new faves! The chicken thigh skewers are classic but also just the very best. The foie gras was so well balanced and so good we ordered a second one! The butternut squash veggie was also utterly fantastic. Well paired with rich, fresh, and flavorful flavors!"
,,,,,"I finally got to @thepigchicago and boy does it live up to the hype! We had cocktails while we waited for a spot on the patio to open up. We had great service and got to know the couples at the tables beside us (and ask all about what they ordered). Our favorites were the beets with pistachio butter (do not miss this!), polenta, and marshmallow fluff-peanut butter mille feuille. The pics didn't turn out great, but it was worth it to eat on the patio in perfect weather. Can't recommend highly enough."
,,,,,More than Mu Shu
,,,,,"I'm not an expert in pig cuisine, actually a newbie to it. I thought pulled pork came from playing tug of war with a pig. "
,,,,,But the purple pig on MIchigan Avenue has a terrific reputation and a line. There are even chairs outside the restaurant to people can wait comfortably. 
,,,,,"I wasn't going to wait in line for a crowded restaurant. But when my meeting let out early and there was no line between lunch and dinner, I decided to give it a try. "
,,,,,"I get it now!  Great food, reasonably priced. Everything has some meat, sauce and shredded something.  I sat at the chefs table and got to see 8 people crammed together push out amazing food quickly. The chefs table were all tourists who came because of a guidebook, many mentioned the James Beard award, all tried different dishes. "
,,,,,"I had the porkchetta, Korean themed pork sandwich, and was very impressed. Loved the sauce, the hard role and whatever was on top of it. "
,,,,,"The wine book was intimidating. I asked the waiter to bring me a full body fruity red that would go well with Korean pork sandwich, and he brought out a nice 16 dollar glass of wine. "
,,,,,"Dessert was surprisingly excellent. The guava white chocolate mouse was light, sweet and had a wafer that made the flavors linger. "
,,,,,It is worth waiting in line for this place. 
,,,,,Going alone and sitting at the kitchen table was a fun experience. Going with a group and getting pig tapas to share would also be great. 
,,,,,Looking forward to coming back here!
,,,,,"I'll start with the drinks. They were crafted so well and they were delicious. Frankly we had too many, but I blame them for making them so good. The octopus was outstanding. Definitely try it. The flavor was unbelievable. The duck was crispy, juicy, and sweet. I can't wait to go back."
,,,,,"I can't say enough about this place! The food combos are different and delicious. I could eat several portions of the beat salad myself, no problem. Wine selection is amazing but I am a mixed drinks person. Don't miss out on visiting this superb restaurant!"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was my favourite food experience in Chicago! Despite the hour-long wait to get seated, it turned out to be worthwhile."
,,,,,"Myself and a couple others shared 5 plates, which filled us up! Ranked in order from best to worse, we tried: Bone Marrow, Octopus, Pig Ears, Neck Bone Gravy, and Sausage. The first two were to die for but you could probably skip the latter 3. Also, space was really, really tight."
,,,,,"I came here for lunch with my gf and her friend on a Saturday and got a table inside at 11:30.  5 minutes later, all the tables inside the restaurant were filled.  There were still lots of tables in the patio, but it was about 40 degrees outside. "
,,,,,"The food here was great.  We started the pork chicharrones, grilled broccoli, the cubano, and the stuffed squid.  The chicharrones a bit too crispy - the girls didn't like it.  The cubano was tasty and the spices did not make it too salty.  The grilled broccoli was damn good and the stuffed squid also came with this green sauce, which I adored.  My girlfriend loved it, so I gave her most of my piece - there were only 4 squids in the dish."
,,,,,"Upon getting here we checked in  with the hostess and she quoted us a 45min wait, we then went to the small waiting areas with the amazing outdoor heaters. Someone greeted us and we ordered some wine while we waited for our table. We were seated within 30min. "
,,,,,"I highly recommend the beets with whipped goat cheese, the octopus and the croquettes. Each were simply amazing and flavorful. Definitely put this on your list if you're coming to Chicago!"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was our first lunch spot in Chicago; we were visiting from LA. We didn't have a reservation, but stopped by during lunchtime on July 4th. Surprisingly, we only had to wait 20-25 minutes for a table. I was definitely excited for this restaurant after reading so many great reviews on Yelp. However, both my partner and I didn't really enjoyed our meal. "
,,,,,"-- Pork Belly w/ Ginger Glaze, Carrot + Espresso: the meat was cooked perfectly, but the sauce was just too sweet, almost unbearably so. "
,,,,,"-- Lamb Chops w/ Sheep's Milk Yogurt, Anchovy Brown Butter, Fava Beans: this dish was okay. Again, I didn't think the sauce compliments the meat very well. "
,,,,,"-- Pork Jowl w/ Asparagus, Mushrooms and Duck Egg: this had a surprised sour/tangy taste that took me by surprise. It was probably my favorite dish out of everything we ordered. "
,,,,,I think we ordered another dish but I totally forgot what it was.. didn't get to take a picture of it. 
,,,,,"In addition, they had a long list of beer/wine/cocktails. That's always a plus! The venue is modern and hip, but noise level was way too loud. It was difficult to have a conversation."
,,,,,"Our server was super weird, at the point of being pretentious. He made us feel very awkward when we were ordering and when we asked for our check at the end. Uh, what is your problem? "
,,,,,"Overall, this place is not my cup of tea."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Booked a late reservation here for my 30th birthday. A group of my closest friends and I My first time in the city and this restaurant was recommended by more than one person, so I was excited to give it a try. My party was caught up on the red line getting to the restaurant and had trouble finding the entrance. The host on the phone informed me, ""well, you're running late. We stop serving exactly at 10pm, so I don't know what to tell you."" "
,,,,,"This made for a stressful experience for everyone involved. The event turned into a race to sit down and order. Halfway through dinner, the waiter let us know we would be fine to continue ordering past 10pm. The host sat on his phone while we ate, and looked as if he was ready to clock out at a moment's notice. The food was great, and all it took was one person to turn an important milestone into a negative experience. The next time we make it to Chicago, we will not be visiting The Purple Pig. The front of house staff is a position management should not overlook or take for granted."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig Restaurant is worth visiting and such a perfect place to go to. Everything there is so delicious, from their meats that is so tasty, really soft, and juicy. And also their desserts were really good. Their customer service was prompt and friendly, they all know how to treat their customers in a right way, all of them are so decent and professional. When it comes to their place, they got the perfect location, it is so big, nice, clean, and bright. It is so near to other well-known stores around the city. They have a great atmosphere, decorated inside and outside, and also most comfortable place I have ever been. Overall was a good experience. The Purple Pig Restaurant gives a right portion, delicious plating, and healthy food. You will definitely be satisfy once you try some of their dishes, you can also explore their big menu if you want, and you can buy anything you want there without breaking your pockets because they are so fair and their prices are so reasonable. Everything there is so phenomenal, and the world needs more places like Purple Pig Restaurant. Thank you Purple Pig for such a wonderful experience. Will go back there again soon when I am nearby! Thank you!"
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was initially hard to find, and made even more difficult considering that Uber directed our driver to drop us off on Illinois St.  The restaurant is in fact located on Michigan which is a staircase up and away and is located inside on the first floor of a corporate building."
,,,,,"We came on a Thursday night around 9:00pm, no reservation, and was told that there would be a 45-60 minute wait.  Well, we came all this way and proceeded to wait."
,,,,,"Their menu is tapas style, so we ordered the Pork Jowl ($18).  Surprisingly, it was more like an open faced bacon-lettuce-tomato (BLT) sandwich, topped with an over easy duck egg.  The bread was also really firm.  Everything was just so extreme, flavorwise.  I was barely recovering from the sourness and hardness of the bread that when I reached the stuffed squid ($18), my lips and tongue were numb.  Overall, their food seems to be on the sour end, at least from my experience.  This is a pretty well-sought out restaurant in Chicago, but perhaps it just wasn't for me."
,,,,,"Also, getting requesting to be picked up by Uber after the meal provided the same jarring experience."
,,,,,"Yum. Several people recommend I check out this place when visiting Chicago, and I'm so glad I had the chance to drop by before leaving!"
,,,,,"We came here about 10 minutes before their weekday opening lunch time and were the first in line. Soon after, the restaurant began filling up with lunch patrons - a mixture of families and business people."
,,,,,"As many others have mentioned, all of the plates are meant to be shared tapas-style, so bring a dining buddy or five so you can try more dishes! My friend and I shared:"
,,,,,"+ Salt-Roasted Beets: FAVORITE DISH, no questions asked. All-caps because it was really that good. The presentation was lovely, and the flavors & textures all worked together so well - sweet, savory, a little acidity; tender beets with some crunchy pistachio bits and creamy, fluffy whipped goat cheese... Okay, maybe I just really like beets, dairy, and nut butters, so this was like the perfect dish to me haha. As long as you don't outright hate all of the above (or even if you do, have someone else order it and snag a bite - maybe you'll change your mind), give this dish a try!"
,,,,,"+  Eggplant Caponata: close runner-up to the salt-roasted beets. Again, all of the flavors worked really well together; the bread was delightfully crunchy, and the olive oil added a nice freshness."
,,,,,"+ Octopus a la Plancha: this was highly-rated by a lot of people, but honestly I've had better octopus elsewhere. Nevertheless, it was nicely grilled and very meaty. Green beans were meh. I didn't really like the salsa verde; it had a strong mint flavor."
,,,,,"+ Milk-Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder: the meat was super tender for sure, and overall this was a good dish but it didn't wow me like the beets and eggplant caponata. My friend commented that it reminded her of Thanksgiving dinner flavors, especially with the mashed potatoes."
,,,,,"Also, I'm not sure if it was just our table, but the service was pretty brisk for it being a pricier restaurant. Is shoving aside plates and water glasses upon bringing a new dish typical? At least the guy refilling water smiled. Not basing this review on the service, but it would be a 3 or maybe even a 2/5 when I look at our meal's bill."
,,,,,"I'll still recommend this place to others because the beets and eggplant were ah-mazing, but perhaps not the octopus or pork shoulder. The scallops at the table next to us did look tasty though (and the two ladies raved about how good they were)!"
,,,,,Amazing from the dishes to the service.
,,,,,Incredible coordination and presentation.  Went for lunch and split a 1/2 bottle of wine.  Dishes were excellent.
,,,,,Coming back for dinner
,,,,,AMAZING!! I really wish my fiancé and I had the stomach to try the whole menu. If we could we would. About 4 dishes is recommended for a table of 2. Although we were stuffed by the 3rd dish!! 
,,,,,"If you're not a pork lover, don't fret. There are so many options seafood, veggies, and other meats! I would definitely try the pork belly & tenderloin though, but honestly everything we tried and everything the other tables had looked amazing! "
,,,,,"Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is super busy! We also had to wait 30 mins for a table for 2. However, we did find our service from our waitress really rushed, so fast that the menu and highlights were just blurted out. (The reason we decided 4/5). Maybe it was our particular waitress, who just wanted to accommodate guests really fast and have people go in and out? At one point we saw her bringing guests who were waiting outside to have them seated (mind you, there are 2 other hostess at the front). It was just odd towards the end of the meal as she didn't realize that we actually finished all 3 dishes by the time she came back to check in on us and asked how our first dish was?"
,,,,,"I came back here after 6 years and it's still just as good, if not better, than I remember it. In the past 6 years, if I ever met anybody from Chicago I'd beg them to try the Purple Pig if they hadn't already. I'm so thankful to be back. Do yourself a favor, seriously, eat here! I'm only hoping they finally open one up in Los Angeles."
,,,,,"The most legit octopus dish I've ever had, and I mean ever!!! I usually don't eat seafood in land locked states, but the pictures from my fellow Yelper's made me try this dish, and I'm so glad I did. "
,,,,,"Decor-first this place is located in the Magnificent Mile which is a super cool location. One other note, location is not easy to find, but that makes it fun. Large bar, large outdoor eating area, and communal tables describe this place. Upscale everything and I loved the open kitchen so you could see them cook your food. "
,,,,,"Service-I sat at the bar, and staff behind bar were great! They were attentive and seemed to live working there, which is very important to me. "
,,,,,"Food-only tried octopus dish and was amazing!!! Super tender and fresh. Seasoned with a pesto and oil sauce that was packed with flavor. Asparagus and baby potatoes complemented octopus perfectly. Honestly, you could've put this octopus in cardboard and it would've been amazing! Staff mentioned they marinated octopus in wine for 36 hours and then seat it on stove for maximum tenderness. Simply amazing, well done guys!!"
,,,,,Can't wait to come back and try this dish again along with others.
,,,,,"MMMMMMM I'm so glad that my sister found this place because the food here is absolutely DELICIOUS! There was a wait to sit inside so we opted to sit outside (which wasn't bad), a little bit chilly but they had warmers which helped (especially since I went during the winter). The staff are friendly and they really know their stuff which helped with ordering our dinner. we got the pork belly, the duck, and the octopus for three people. the pork belly was SOOO juicy and delicious and the duck was HUGE!! we couldn't even finish it! the octopus we could have gone without though (nothing special). we all were licking our fingers because the food was so good! the meat literally melted off the bones and we wanted more ~ haha. definitely recommend, all around an amazing restaurant (just on the pricier side)."
,,,,,"Their website mentioned they accept walk-ins, and they turned us away at the door because they claim to only take reservations at this time. Really didn't make much sense since there were plenty of empty tables At least update your website if you're going to turn away paying customers."

,,,,,"Always a pleasure to have the chance to stop by the purple pig whenever I'm in the Windy City. Seriously a must-eat spot, and personally I think it's worth whatever wait you encounter. "
,,,,,"We had the most scrumptious bites of gnocchi filled with cheese. Idk if we were biased bc we were starving and it was first warm bite of food, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of those bites. We then ordered two entrees, the esteemed milk braised pork shoulder and the tasty pork belly entree (forgot the name of it.. not the taste though!) and finished it all off with some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. Words cannot do the flavors justice, you'll just have to eat them for yourselves to find out the magic! "
,,,,,"They recently moved their location to an indoor, more corporate feel location. Because Chicago has varying degrees of tolerable to intolerable weather, I think it's a good move. I do miss the more rustic feel of the older location though.. "
,,,,,"Though it may seem pricey, I always feel the portion sizes are spot on and I never leave hungry! "
,,,,,A MUST TRY for any Chicago visits!
,,,,,I have nothing but good things to say about The Purple Pig. The food was great and the service was even better so I left there happy and full. 
,,,,,"The food is tapas style and I split three dishes with my sister and it was more than enough for the both of us, I was struggling to finish my half of the last dish. We ordered the cornbread, grilled octopus, and pork shoulder. We started off with the cornbread and it was alright but nothing special. The octopus and pork shoulder however tasted amazing! The pork shoulder was my favorite dish and is a must get. Very filling and great flavors! I would recommend both of those dishes if you ever stop here. "
,,,,,The entrance is down an alleyway but the sign is out near the street so it's easy to find.
,,,,,"This restaurant was very close to the hotel I was staying, so I decided to check it out. I was not particularly hungry but still went because we were seated immediately on a busy night and shared the Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder. It was alright and fails to meet the expectations of all the reviews raving about this dish. Sure, it was marinated decently, but it was nowhere near ""melting"" or ""tender"". There were rough patches and pieces that were particularly dry. For a signature dish, I was really expecting much more, especially considering the above average price point."
,,,,,This restaurant is what everybody raves about and more! 
,,,,,I was in Chicago to attend a convention and finally got the chance to eat at The Purple Pig. 
,,,,,"The restaurant is always packed and they do not take reservations, so scoring a table is almost impossible but with some perseverance I finally lucked out - twice in a week to boot!"
,,,,,The first time I ordered the octopus salad and the pork shoulder - both were delicious! 
,,,,,The Sicilian Iris dessert was the perfect ending to a superior meal and still has my mouth watering every time I think about it.
,,,,,"The second time I ordered their wildly popular bone marrow (a winner!), the beets and the spare ribs. "
,,,,,"The servers are friendly but extra busy, the prices are very reasonable for a restaurant located in the Magnificent Mile."
,,,,,"This was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time. Such unique, rustic flavors!!! Sadly the ambiance, music and server  do not compliment the caliber and uniqueness of the cuisine. But get over it and go anyway."
,,,,,"Great food options and new location! The cocktails were smaller than before. Great service, as always."
,,,,,"Five stars for the food, 4 stars for the service and 2 stars for ambiance. We came on a Sunday evening around 5:30 and it took 45 minutes to get a table for 3. We're seated in the patio and at a big communal table. We're seated close to other guests and barely have any elbow room. The noise level is very high in the restaurant. It's very loud and it's not a place to have a nice quiet dinner and chat. "
,,,,,"Our friendly server took our order and the food came in a reasonable time. We ordered the grilled cuttlefish, pork and charred cauliflower. All of the are delicious and impressively flavorful with nice combination of Teton each dish. The cuttlefish was grilled perfectly and the charcoal bread added a nice sweetness to the dish. The Coppa pork was cooked perfectly and greatly seasoned. The shishito peppers, lentil and pomegranate gave a nice flavor and texture to the dish. The cauliflower dish are delicious as well. It's tangy with a hint of charred flavor."
,,,,,"I don't brag about a lot of things, but I'm quite proud of my restaurant selections when it comes to group culinary adventures. We were at a convention and hungry for lunch. It was finally time to leave the two-block radius and take a Lyft to Magnificent Mile. Originally we wanted Lou Malnati's but the wait was too long. I've had Purple Pig bookmarked for awhile, so we headed there."
,,,,,"Because it was a late lunch in the middle of the work week, there was no wait. Whew! I totally expected at least a 30 minute line. The four of us were seated at the high top communal table on the outdoor patio. Gorgeous Chicago weather, and perfect for hanging out on the patio, especially since it was covered."
,,,,,"We shared our food family style, and ordered quite a bit: "
,,,,,* Cornbread
,,,,,* Chicharrones
,,,,,* Caprese Salad
,,,,,* Calamari Salad
,,,,,* Garganelli Pasta
,,,,,* Chicken Thigh Kebabs
,,,,,"The cornbread and chicharrones were my favorites. I could eat them forever. This restaurant -- both food and service -- lived up to everything I expected. Totally worth the trip out here. While I took a Lyft back to the hotel, some of my colleagues walked around MM for some sightseeing... great area to go for a walk and just check out the beautiful, historic sites!"
,,,,,"Love the new location of the Purple Pig! Super cute place! They have a HUGE wine selection. Their menu is definitely super different! But very delicious! Happy hour is Monday-Friday with select wines for around 8$/glass, a 4$ beer, and a 12$ burger. Very basic burger for sure! "
,,,,,"Grilled Broccoli is the best thing ever! It had an anchovy sauce on it! Sounded so weird, but it was the best broccolis I have ever had! DEFINITELY get this! It was out of this world! My NUMBER ONE MUST GET! "
,,,,,Chicken thigh kebabs were so flavorful and the chicken was moist and cooked to perfection. 
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder is a must! So tender and melt in your mouth good!! 
,,,,,"I heard that their pig ears are also the bomb, however the group I was with, didn't want to get that adventurous! This was a top recommendation though so maybe try it!"
,,,,,This place is AMAZING 
,,,,,One of the best meals that I have ever had. Their bone marrow was just perfect combined with greens that will make it fresh and enhanced the flavor 
,,,,,We also had the pork shoulder which was delicious as well as the duck.
,,,,,The service was impeccable as well.

,,,,,"We loved coming here. Despite ordering vegetarian, the dishes were excellent. The customer service was great, respectful and the food was clearly prepared fresh. The food was very satisfying and the portions were generous."
,,,,,If it hasn't been said before the wait is up there 2+hours.  Put your names in then have a drink somewhere. But be prepared to run.  You get 10 Minutes to get there after you get your text.  The service is spot in a large rotation of different staff taking care of you.  All the food we had was amazing!  Tapas style plates however the brussel sprouts are a meal themselves.  It will take probably 5 to 6 visits with a sizeable group the try the entire menu. And I would be excited to do so.  Very well prepared food thought and designed amazingly!
,,,,,Came here at 4 pm on a Sunday in a group of 3 and was seated immediately to our surprise. The foie gras was amazing - paired with ice cream to go against the fattiness. 
,,,,,The octopus was surprisingly good - great flavor and seasoning that was unexpected from a restaurant that specializes in all things pork. The shoulder was great and we literally scraped every bit of that plate. 
,,,,,The sicilian iris is a definite must. It's basically a deep fried donut with nutella filling (though they call it brioche). Came served warm with the filling oozing out when cut. If I could do so without the lines I would go back just for that!
,,,,,"Just had dinner today for my 5th wedding anniversary.  Was really excited to eat here as this was our first time despite being in chicago for the last 4 years. We were seated promptly and the place was very clean with nice soothing music in the background. We ordered the crispy pig ear, the bone marrow, roasted beets, half duck and milk braised pork. To be honest, the crispy pig ear almost tasted like nothing. We couldnt tell if it was actual meat and the crispy kale that it comes with was seasoned quite heavily with salt. Hats off to the chef on understanding what works with what. If you eat the fried ear, fried kale and egg in one bite, the whole dish kinda makes sense, but the dish on its own wasnt worth the hype. The bone marrow and roasted beets were brought next. I was actually incredibly excited to try the bone marrow and for 25 bucks it better be worth the hype! I was thoroughly disappointed  the bone marrow comes with slices of toasted bread and some parsley with capers salad. The bone marrow had 0 flavor which was really disappointing. On top of that, the pickled capers were super salty so the salad itself did not taste that good either. What actually caught me by surprise were the roasted beets. Wow! I cannot compliment the chef enough for putting this dish on the menu. The beets had a nice sweet flavor and were paired with goat cheese foam, pistachios and peanut butter. I really realpy enjoyed eating these and my wife doesnt really like beets and she ended up loving this dish! 5 stars for the roasted beets! We then had the milk braised pork and boy was this a big fail  the meat was really tender but SO salty. The pork was served with mashed potatoes and gravy and i guess really salty pork with mildly salted mashed potatoes and gravy kinda works but man, this dish definitely did not live up to all the comments. I think the pork was brined in too much salt since the meat was salty in and out. I actually ate the pork with some of the roasted beets to offset the saltiness. Wouldve imagined that at least the pork dishes would be perfectly seasoned since the restaurant has a pig in its name! Finally had the duck and boy oh boy, im so glad we ate that as our last dish. The duck was seasoned perfectly (a little more salt wouldve turned it really salty) and its combination along with yoghurt and fish eggs turned out perfectly! Duck skin is one of the most heavenly things out there and this dish didnt disappoint for sure. We really enjoyed it a lot. We also ended up ordering the panna cotta as this would be our second time having panna cotta in our lives. Im not too experienced with this but the panna cotta here isnt really jelloey. It was kinda condensed and didnt taste as milky as i thought it would but didnt really taste bad either. All in all, the food was just ok in my view. I again would like to compliment the chef for coming up with the combination of ingredients in each dish because they really seemed to work but the over seasoning really killed it. The kitchen staff should really keep a look out for over seasoning such expensive dishes. Not really sure if the regular customer enjoys their food this salty and at $20+, the dishes should be more palatable. I really loved the service we were provided. We told our server that it was our 5th anniversary and she went ahead a got us a candle to make it extra special for us. So definitely 5 stars for the service but probably just 3 for the food. My advice would be to definitely AVOID the bone marrow and the milk braised pork. You could try the fried pork ear for fun but its nothing to rave about. Definitely get the beets and the half duck as you won't be disappointed."
,,,,,Great place awesome menu. Service is fantastic. Hope they can get back to pre COVID customers bc this place deserves to be around for a long time.
,,,,,Absolutely the best. Everyone needs to go here and support this restaurant. They have been doing it for a while and they need your support. Food is extremely good and they have new dishes even with everything going on!
,,,,,"It's good but not that amazing. Come here for a brunch at around 3pm, environment is a little noisy but it's okay since there are many people dining. Service is passionate and helpful."
,,,,,"I choose the fixed price menu for $20 including the broccoli as a starter, ricotta gnocchi as main dish and affogato as dessert."
,,,,,"Dishes are not so surprising as I thought, all of them are too salty for me. But the meat and broccoli are creamy and the dessert is really a nice one. The non-alcoholic beverage is made up of ginger and lemon so it's really fresh!!"
,,,,,"It's a really popular restaurant in Chicago and appears in many restaurants recommendations. But actually I don't feel it really impressed me, maybe I'm not a meat lover...? It's just an average restaurant that is suitable for lunch/dinner/brunch for me, nothing really special. Maybe next time I'll try their signature dishes with pork"
,,,,,"Food is beautifully decorated and placed and also tastes delicious! Came on a Saturday afternoon. Tables were full, so we sat at the bar."
,,,,,Received excellent service from my waiter. I don't remember his name. But he was super helpful and knowledgeable with the menu.
,,,,,Delicious food! My boyfriend and I went here for our first date and had a great time. Will definitely go back.
,,,,,"Probably one of the more upscale places I wouldn't have imagined going to. I came across this place a few days before my friend and I took our trip to Chicago. It ended up becoming one of her friend's recommendations for must try places. So, one nigh we decided to just go for it since we were in the area. The wait time for a table of two was about an hour. To kill some time, we ended up walking around before indulging. We got seated promptly and the atmosphere was dimmed, but made it feel like a very lively outting- in. The waitress let me sample 3-4 different types of wine just to figure out my preference and she was more than accommodating in helping me select the right one."
,,,,,We got the corn mash to start and it was so flavorful! The portion was a good amount for two ladies to share. 
,,,,,"Then, we got talked into ordering the duck. This was a dish I didn't intend on ordering but the server said that they braise it for days/hours. I guess we couldn't say no. haha. It ended up being amazing. There were giant pieces of duck meat, unlike many other places that have ducks with more skin than meat. You put it in a fluffy bun and the white sauce on the side really compliment the entire entree. It's a mix of fun and umami flavors all together."
,,,,,"Finally, we had the bone marrow because that was the most ordered item around. I've never had bone marrow before, so I had a high expectation for this. It was huge!! Very fatty tasting, but it didn't make me feel ""greasy"". So that was great. Slap it on the crunchy/ soft side bread and top it with cilantro, and well enjoy! "
,,,,,"Definitely on the pricier side, but a good type of pricey and I would say it was worth it."
,,,,,One of the BEST spots in Chicago! Ever dish was amazing. Perfect combinations. Make sure to get the focaccia and grilled broccoli.

,,,,,"The Purple Pig - need I say more? Regardless, here's another review that more or less, echoes the majority of other reviews found here. "
,,,,,"Because of the ongoing construction, the restaurant relocated to another building not too far from where it used to be. "
,,,,,"We ordered bone marrow, pork tongue, octopus, and lamb ribs. Although I have always enjoyed eating bone marrow, other people in my party were not too excited, nor shared the same enthusiasm. So unless you have a prior experience eating a bone marrow dish, be cautious - it certainly is not for everyone. "
,,,,,"Pork tongue was simply marvelous. It comes in a bit size, covered in tonnato sauce, and simply melts in your mouth. "
,,,,,Octopus was very tender and not rubbery. I especially enjoyed how salsa verde complemented the octopus. 
,,,,,"Now, as for the final dish: I liked how it was paired up with fregolas. But the bbq sauce was a bit too much for me - though my friends seemed to like this dish the most."
,,,,,"I have been here twice and it never disappoints. Brought friend here from out of town. And she couldn't stop raving about it! She said it was the best place I have taken her in the city  everything was cooked amazingly, fresh, and just enough. "
,,,,,My only complaint was the temperature inside was so cold. We were even sitting by the door. My friends nose started running and she wasn't sick.
,,,,,"This was my first meal after landing in Chicago. My friends and I came by on a Saturday for brunch. We placed our name, walked around, and was called to our table in a little over an hour. Luckily since The Purple Pig is so centrally located, we were able to walk around and explore the city during that time."
,,,,,"The restaurant is crowded with a lot of communal tables. The family-knit atmosphere follows with the family-style of sharing multiple dishes though. Between the four of us, we shared 6 dishes, which was the perfect amount. My favorites had to be the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder ($19) and Chicken Thigh Kebabs ($17). The pork shoulder was perfectly cooked and just fell off the bone. The tenderness of the meat paired so smoothly with the pureed mashed potatoes for this divine consistency. As for the chicken kebabs, they came in huge pieces grilled on a skewer on top of beautifully roasted potatoes. The potatoes were so crispy, yet soft that just made every bite so heavenly. I'd definitely get these two dishes again."
,,,,,"We also ordered the Crispy Pig's Ears ($15), which is one of their most popular dishes. It comes topped with a sunnyside egg to mixed into the crispy pig ears and veggies. This was a nice dish with a sour twist, but didn't stand out as much to me. The Grilled Broccoli ($13) was a very unique take of the vegetable with a crispy yet creamy texture in a hint of sour taste as well. This was a favorite amongst our table."
,,,,,"Our last two dishes were the Olive Oil Poached Tuna ($12) and Stuffed Squid ($16). The tuna was so vividly colorful in a beautiful presentation from the purple potatoes, green beans, red peppers, yellow quail eggs, and of course the pink tuna. This was a fun and tasteful dish to try! Now although the squid was good, it came with only 3 pieces. It was also stuffed, so made splitting between 4 people a bit of a mess."
,,,,,"Overall, delicious and unique spot on various types of menu items. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of tapas, I'd still recommend coming here and living its hype. I'd definitely be back for their meat menu items though, especially that pork shoulder!"
,,,,,"After calling Chicago home for the past 8 years, I finally had the opportunity to dine at the ICONIC Purple Pig. Not going to lie, I always had a stigma about this place being a tourist trap and somewhere only Mag Mile shoppers go. Boy did I eat my words! "
,,,,,"While yes, I am sure many of the people who dine here are from out of town, that doesn't make their food any less amazing! I was blown away by their extensive menu and the dishes we got. We arrived about 10 minutes before opening on a Wednesday, and there were already people gathering. The space is beautifully lit and I loved their rustic French decor. We ordered the smoked pork tongue (my favorite), crispy pig's ear, lamb's rib, and the caviar & ice cream. Nothing disappointed. "
,,,,,"The pork tongue is served in thin delicate slices with a creamy white sauce. The tongue was so tender, and had a real smoky/peppery flavor I  loved. The crispy pig's ear was also tasty. I've had cold pig ear before, but this was my first time trying it fried and I loved it. Almost like onion strings but way better. The lamb's rib was HUGE! We couldn't finish it all, but no less tasty. It was fall-off-the-bone tender. And we can't forget the caviar and ice cream. Served on this wafer thin waffle fry chip, it was gorgeous and tasted as good as it looked. The ice cream was whipped to perfection and made a nice compliment to the salty caviar. "
,,,,,"Our serve was super attentive and patient with us as we carefully purussed the menu, trying to make a tough decision. I finally understand the hype, and I am anxiously awaiting my next visit!"
,,,,,"An update is due, since it's been years since my last review and I still make a point to go to The Purple Pig when I'm in Chicago. I always come back for the Crispy Pig's Ears, and stay for every single other dish I can get my hands on. Also, they relocated since I was last here! The space is now just a couple doors down on Michigan. It has a little less character (in a residential or commercial building), but a lot more covered space while you wait!"
,,,,,"So yes, I always get the crispy pig's ear here. I just can't get anything like it elsewhere, and the crispiness of the ear batter and the tang from the banana peppers is absolutely addicting. Lol @ ""ear batter"". Be sure to break the yolk and mix it all together. We also got the smoked pork tongue, which was so tender, smokey, and a little sweet. I loved that it was finished with some char. The lamb ribs were ridiculously rich and tender, and I liked the citrus notes in the garnish. Last but certainly not least, the potato ice cream with caviar is truly a treat. The ice cream is not too sweet, and the pops of salty fish roe is an innovative and delicious pairing. Get this, please!"
,,,,,"This place is always busy, but always well-staffed with efficient crew. I love it."
,,,,,"This is a Chicago staple. It's right on the Magnificent Mile, and it's god damn delicious. And reasonably priced! *sold*"
,,,,,"I've been here about 3 or 4 times, and have always loved the experience. Like most places in the area, they do not take resos. But feel free to add your name to the list, and then they will serve you cocktails as you wait on the patio. "
,,,,,"Their menu is expansive and rotates. But I usually start the meal with a satisfying cheese plate. Their dips are surprisingly largely portioned, accompanied with big pieces of buttery toast. But save room for their inventive dishes like fried pig's ear, sweetbreads, and house-made pasta with ground fish. Yes, those sound like totally random and possibly unappealing words but I assure you the dishes are packed with close-your-eyes-and-shake-your-head heavenly flavor. If you catch their meatballs on the menu, give those a shot too. I'm so sad those balls aren't in my mouth right now!!"
,,,,,"Pros: Location, Service, Food, Drinks."
,,,,,"Cons: Space is a little tight, pricey"
,,,,,This would make a great date night spot if you make a reservation which I would advise you do.
,,,,,The Bad - 
,,,,,Had to wait an hour to be seated
,,,,,"The highly touted milk braised pork shoulder is visually appealing but bland! It was heavy and had no spark in flavor. Try Cuban Mojo Pork Shoulder with pork rind skin instead on a bed of sweet plantain, garlic & bacon mash. Thank me later..."
,,,,,The Good-
,,,,,Knowledgeable server
,,,,,Great variety of options
,,,,,The Nero D'Avola was delicious - Nice to have on the menu
,,,,,The Pig Ear with Fried Kale and Fried Egg - Amazing
,,,,,The Octopus Was Super Tasty and Tender
,,,,,The Brussels Sprouts were Super Tasty and Creative
,,,,,The Bone Marrow was Amazing!!
,,,,,The Chocolate Caramel Tart was very very good! 
,,,,,Overall I would return easily but would avoid the pork shoulder.
,,,,,On a scale of 1-10 I am giving The Purple Pig a 9.2!
,,,,,Great service and food. I believe the restaurant is aimed towards a younger crowd ( under 70)
,,,,,"Review for BRUNCH: Delicious food and great service. Except salty and meat-heavy dishes, but the salads are actually quite tasty too! If you love prosciutto you will love this place. The inside restaurant is nice and has big windows that overlook the city. "
,,,,,"Very interesting and varied wine list (they have awards for it), with some rare greek wines, etc. "
,,,,,"Do NOT recommend their new outside seating - it's literally in an alley, and next an alley. Plus it looks super shoddy and like they set it up last week (because they did). They've set up a port-a-potty outside for people eating outside (uhh.....). And there's like a highway in the next block, so the ambiance score is about 0."
,,,,,"As someone who doesn't eat pork, I was hesitant to visit the famous swine forward restaurant that everyone raved about. BUT as I looked at the menu I saw an entire section dedicated to veggies and a Mediterranean inspired menu with flavors to entice all types of eaters. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic - ready to answer questions and make lovely recommendations. "
,,,,,"The Brussels sprouts had a conglomerate of flavors that made a symphony of flavors, and the chicken thigh kabobs had a tahini/shallot sauce that reminded me of my Persian mother's home. With a taste of old Mediterranean cooking yet a fresh perspective, I can see why this spot is such a classic spot. "
,,,,,"I was able to get a table for two without a reservation on a Sunday night but reservations are highly recommended. In a great part of town, it is the perfect place to eat then explore the riverwalk and all the Michigan Ave shopping has to offer."

,,,,,"I was in Chicago over the weekend and looking for a good place to eat around 9 p.m.  I went on yelp and found the Purple Pig - with four stars and over 6,000 reviews, it looked promising!  I was not disappointed, and this is why I love Yelp!  I can always count on fellow yelpers when I'm in a different city."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was crowded even around 9 p.m., and we had to wait 15 minutes for a spot at the bar.  There is a patio area, and the main dining area consists of a good sized bar and several high tables.  It looks like they have an extensive wine list and a good number of beers, but I just wanted a quick dinner.  I ordered the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes.  The pork was so juicy and tender that I didn't need a knife at all during dinner.  The pork was well seasoned, and the mashed potatoes underneath had a perfect creamy consistency to round out the dish. "
,,,,,"The servers were all great, and the bartender was recommending drinks and wine to patrons around us.  He definitely seemed knowledgeable, and I'll have to come back next time to try some of their other dishes and drinks!"
,,,,,"Love love loved my experience at The Purple Pig! I don't even know where to begin...we came to here for a spontaneous lunch on a Friday with my cousins.  I'd heard great things, but never really took the initiative to try it out.  But boy am I glad that I did!  We waited about 5 minutes for a table for our party of 6.  They expanded this new location which is conveniently right next to the old to provide more seating, that's how busy they are! "
,,,,,"We ordered a 2010 Spanish wine for the table, and it was absolutely delicious! I have to say their drink selection is quite good with a great variety.  We decided to try a bunch of different dishes for the table.  I can't even tell you what I liked the best because it was all just amazing.  What I will say is don't miss out on the Pig Ears...didn't sound appetizing at first, but it's a must have on the menu! Everything else came out in great portion to share across the table.  Service was great, my water was always full, empty plates cleared immediately, and we may have had a bit of a spillage accident which was taken care of right away.  "
,,,,,"Loved the environment, while it was quite busy it wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear each other across the table.  The restaurant is in a great location to take a stroll down Michigan Ave afterwards to try and digest some of that yummy food.  I will definitely be returning next time I'm back in town!"
,,,,,"Great menu, great service, unique food! A real treat! Will be back! This is an innovative, very creative menu."
,,,,,"We had a birthday celebration at this place. Cool place and nice dishes. Hard to get reservation, especially with limited seating now. Wine collection is good, so are their cocktails. Ordered Pig's ear and Fried Brussel Sprout Leaves. Pig's ear were a little salty for my taste, but Bruss was incredible. Chicken Kabob was good, nicely cooked and juicy and the side of smashed potatoes was really good. Gyro and Pork belly glaze were just okay. Overall I would say nice place to dine and good food."
,,,,,"I love the Purple Pig. Definitely a go-to spot in downtown Chicago. The line can get really long so get there early if you're going on a weekend. Regardless, it's worth it. We got seats at the counter/bar and got to watch the chefs prepare each dish. The vibe was pretty chill and low key but the food was mind blowingly good."
,,,,,"Grilled Broccoli: This is possibly the most amazing broccoli I have ever had in my life. It was juicy, tender, and had so much flavor. Presentation definitely wasn't the best but the flavor made up for it. Order it. I'd honestly come back just for the broccoli."
,,,,,Crispy Pig's Ear: Alright app. Probably wouldn't order again. Didn't feel that this dish was particularly special but it did come with an egg on top!
,,,,,Octopus: Crowd favorite. The octopus was tender and flavorful. Cooked to perfection. Great app!
,,,,,Milk Braised Pork Shoulder: So juicy and tender. Highly recommend ordering if this is the only meat dish you order.
,,,,,Roasted Bone Marrow: Hefty cut of bone marrow with yummy toasted bread! Would recommend if you're a bone marrow fan. 
,,,,,Half Duck: So much meat. Would not order this again because I've had better duck elsewhere but it's definitely a good dish for a large group to share. This also came last so we were all stuffed by then. 
,,,,,"It isn't often I see a menu and want to order everything off of it. With a group of four, the six dishes we ordered was a bit much. I'd recommend five dishes for four people if you want to try a bit of everything. You can't really make a wrong choice here though. Great food, great vibes (although it does get loud and oily), great experience overall."
,,,,,The SWINE!!! Why would you rave about the SWINE?! Let alone a Purple SWINE!! Because it's absolutely delicious...DUH!! 
,,,,,"Prior to my Chi-Town Trip the suggestions kept pouring in about how The Purple Pig was a must visit...a ton of people I know were just raving about this place, for good reason! Amazing DELICIOUSNESS!!"
,,,,,~ Crispy Pig ears - 5/5 
,,,,,"Didn't realize it came with a Fried Egg on top. My server told me to mix it all up and eat it...so I took his advice. But first, I had to try a few of the Crispy Pig ears by themselves. Amazing! I'm not sure if this dish was suppose to be an appetizer or a main course. Either way, I'm just glad I ordered it...Crispy, Crunchy, Flavorful...FRIED!!! There's nothing bad about this dish! "
,,,,,~ Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder - 5/5
,,,,,"Another absolutely amazing dish! Tell tale sign...this was something special; it was served with a spoon! NO KNIFE!!! My thoughts at the time: A piece of Pork Shoulder on the Bone served with a SPOON?! Hmmm...are they nuts?! Where is my KNIFE?! Did they make a mistake? Nope. Nope. Nope. They got it right! The meat is so tender, it just falls of the bone...no knife required! The Pork was just PERFECT! Tender, Juicy, full of flavor, complemented brilliantly with the Lentils & Mashed Potatoes. I could find no fault...just wish there was more. #LifeOfAFatty"
,,,,,I will endeavor to stop by here every time I am in Chi-Town! Brilliant!
,,,,,"FOOD: This was second dinner for me, so we ordered just a few items. Everything is tapas style, and some of the dishes are actually quite large, making it more affordable. We each ordered a glass of white wine which we enjoyed with our meal - their food is fairly rich so would recommend a refreshing beverage. We started off with three cheeses (the cremeux di citeaux was amazing), pigs ear (a classic - have ordered this every time and not regretted it. I can eat them like chips), and the 'nduja (we didn't expect the bread to be covered in melting cheese). They got one of the cheeses wrong and we unfortunately found a long hair in the pig face - so deducted some points for that. "
,,,,,SERVICE: The service was decent. The waitress was friendly and offered to help us with our selections (although I didn't love her wine suggestion). 
,,,,,"AMBIENCE: This place is ALWAYS packed. My friend and I went on a Tuesday night around 10pm, and I would say it was about 90% full. Hence, it is noisy but lively if that's the vibe you are going for - their music is also quite loud so I would not recommend for large groups."
,,,,,"This place is excellent. However I hope you like pork. What I love about this place is that they let no part of the pig go to waste, and it creates some really neat combinations. The tapas are excellent, and the menu has wine pairings. I'd strongly suggest going here!"
,,,,,It was difficult to get reservations here during lunch and dinner times on the weekend. Ordered the  lMilk Braised Berkshire Shoulder which was delicious - soft and full of flavours. The BBQ Pork Ribs was good but it was on the sweeter side and the Crispy Pig's Ears were my least favourite because it was salty and honestly it tasted like fried batter. The restaurant was pretty loud and it was difficult to chat.
,,,,,"Holy smokes was this place delicious! It over exceeding my expectations. I ordered their octopus with green beans, fingerlings potatoes and green salsa. Literally the best grilled octopus I've had in my life! It was perfectly cooked not chewy and the flavors were amazing. I literally had a foodgasm. I also ordered their roasted bone marrow with herbs. Wow! That little lemony salad was the perfect balance to garnish on top of the bread w/ the bone marrow. My mouth is watering thinking about this dish as well. Customer service was fantastic one of the bartenders made made sure I was well taken care even with the high volume. The bar area is first come first serve so be prepared to wait a bit. This is a must if you come to Chicago!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Really excellent Mediterranean food - authentic flavours and perfectly seasoned. And a good wine list. Lively atmosphere but new location is a bit of a shame - fine once in but arriving isn't quite as charming.
,,,,,"This place never disappoints! This is my must-have every time I am in Chicago. The bone marrow wasn't as good as I remember it pre-COVID (I think it's a lot smaller), but the rest is just so delicious. We got the pork tongue which is really really good melt in your mouth, the paté was tasty but not salty, and the duck is to.die.for. Like the best duck we have ever eaten in our lives. The oreo cheesecake with sorbet was also a hit!"
,,,,,1/11/18
,,,,,"Located on Michigan Ave, you'll probably have to take Uber/Lyft/taxi or public transportation. Interior is very cozy and modern. Waiter was knowledgeable and polite. I just walked in on a weekday afternoon so I can't speak to how busy this place can get but it's one of the most famous (tapas) restaurants in Chicago so I would look into reservations. "
,,,,,I started out with bone marrow and finished loukoumades - favorites. Pigs ear was crazy salty and pork shoulder was a little dry. 
,,,,,1. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad + Sicilian Sea Salt
,,,,,"2. Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers + Fried Egg"
,,,,,3. Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes + Puffed Farro
,,,,,4. Loukoumades - Mini Greek Fried Dough with Cinnamon + Honey
,,,,,My fiancé and I came here around 6:30 pm for dinner and didn't have reservations. There was a 45 minute wait for a table ( way better than the two hour waits at other restaurant in Chicago!!). We ended up being able to find a spot for two at the bar within 5 minutes of waiting so decided to sit at the bar! 
,,,,,Of course we started off with some drinks and appetizers ! I ordered a cheese board to pair with my wine per usual ;) we also got the grilled broccoli which was amazing!! 
,,,,,I love broccoli and this one was soo flavorful! I couldn't get over how good it was! 
,,,,,For entrees my fiancé ordered the pork shoulder and I got the chicken kabobs with grilled cauliflower instead of mashed potatoes( had to try to keep it a little carb friendly ;))
,,,,,My fiancé knows couldn't stop talking about how moist and soft the pork shoulder was. It came with mash potatoes which he liked! 
,,,,,"The chicken kabobs were very flavorful, tender and juicy! I thought the cauliflower was a little too salty for my taste but good!"
,,,,,"Overall, great customer service! Everything on the menu is delicious! Can't wait to go back to Chicago to eat here again"
,,,,,"Jugo (spelling ) has attention to detail like crazy , true workhorse . Josie was amazing recommending great food. Let's be real the whole menu was to die for ... I wish I lived here to try it all... thank you for producing amazing food and having amazing people who work for the company , please come to Arizona . Again gracias to dos senors for all your help, cleaning up !!!"
,,,,,Love love this place!
,,,,,"First, they dont take reservations and it can get pretty crowded. If you stop by when they open and put your name down they will call you when your table is ready. They have all sorts of plates ranging from pork (as the name may suggest), other meats, pasta, veg, and seafood. "
,,,,,"Tapas style, so order a bunch of plates to share with your friends. You can also select your own cheese or charcuterie board. My favorite dishes are"
,,,,,#1 - Roasted Bone Marrow: You haven't lived until you've tried bone marrow here. Its so rich and decadent that it literally melts in your mouth. You spread the deliciousness on a baguette and top with some sea salt and pop it in your mouth. In love. 
,,,,,"#2 - Pork Belly: Seasoned with ginger glaze and espresso (!), which gives it a unique flavor that is a good balance of sweet and savory. Love the combo of textures of the fatty lard and the tender meat. "
,,,,,"#3 - Fried Brussel Sprouts: One of the best vegs, flavored with thyme, lemon and chili flakes. Lots of flavor and healthy too. "
,,,,,"The menu is very diverse - some other unique plates that I am dying to try next time I go, beef tendon chicarrones, truffle sausage, cuttlefish, pheasant and pigs feet, etc."
,,,,,"Fantastic atmosphere, food, and service. Great for date night! I love the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder and the Roasted Broccoli. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of vegetables but he raved about the broccoli for days!"
,,,,,"OMGGGG the food here is AMAZING. Came here last night with friends - it was my first time dining at the Purple Pig. I always thought this wouldn't be a good place for me as I don't eat pork at all, but my friends really wanted to go so I tagged along. "
,,,,,"If you don't eat pork, don't worry. There's plenty of other great options on the menu! We had the bone marrow (beef), salmon with potatoes instead of the quinoa (that's cooked with bacon), and also the chicken thigh kebabs. Everything was AMAZING. "
,,,,,"Besides the food, our waiter was so friendly and nice. He actually went back to see if the quinoa that comes with the salmon could be made without bacon, he then recommended subs for us since it couldn't. Honestly, I loved the service here, the atmosphere, and the food itself was just amazing. "
,,,,,100% would recommend this place to non pork eaters as well as of course those who do.
,,,,,"This place had by far the best Grilled Octopus dish I've ever tasted. It comes with fingerling potatoes, green beans, and a delicious salsa verde, which adds a herb-y/citrus-y flavor to complement the slight char and savory flavor in the octopus. The texture was also perfect - soft and meaty, without being rubbery or slimey. It was perfectly executed and the portion was just right. "
,,,,,"The Crispy Pig's Ears, on the other hand, intrigued me initially, but I found this dish to be disappointing. (First off... they were not purple as one might expect per the restaurant name!!) While all the pieces of both pig's ears and kale were crispy, the overall dish tasted flat (just like fried oily crispy stuff), with only the pickled chili peppers adding any dimension to the flavor profile. The pig's ears were cut so thin and were breaded so heavily that I felt like I was merely eating strips of fried dough. The portion was decent, but the lack of substance made me feel it wasn't worth the $15. "
,,,,,"Pig's ears aside, my overall experience was great. Although I came in on a busy night, I was able to find a seat at the bar pretty quickly and service was good. I forgot which white wine I ordered (something French), but it was also very good! Overall, this is a restaurant I will return to for the Grilled Octopus, and perhaps to try some other menu items!"
,,,,,Food is so good. Service just okay. Cheese and cured meats are must haves. Love everything we ordered.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,We came on a Friday night and were surprised to get seated right away. 
,,,,,Our server was phenomenal. Super knowledgable and was able to help me navigate the menu and even help with certain requests like a glass of wine from a woman winemaker (impressive!)
,,,,,"The Salt-Roasted Beets were amazing and such a HUGE portion. So many beets, several dollops of goat cheese & super nutty, rich pistachio butter. Superb!"
,,,,,The Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder literally fell off the bone. The Mashed potatoes were perfect and I love the crunch from the crispy lentils. Perfectly balanced dish. 
,,,,,Perfect date night for the hubby and me!
,,,,,"This is sooo long overdue! The aunt took the gf and I because she was raving about her favorite app, the BEETS!!! They should be called ""heartBEETS""  instead because they not only tug, but yank! on your heart strings and surprise you throughout each bite! The whipped up, fluffy,  goat cheese, and the slightly sweet pistachio butter complement the roasted beets so well!! "
,,,,,By far one of the tastiest veggie options we had whilst in CHI!
,,,,,This place is so delicious! We stayed at the International Hotel across the street so we were able to come back again the next day to try more dishes. I need to come back a few more times to finish the rest of their menu. Everything.. I mean everything was delicious! 
,,,,,"I wanted to lick the plate clean after devouring the foie gras with ice cream but since I'm fancy, I used the toast to clean it instead haha. "
,,,,,"If you love pate, you got try the Pork Liver Pate. We kept thinking of this dish the entire night and next day decided.. we need it again. "
,,,,,"Service was great both times. If I come back to Chicago again, this place is definitely my first stop."
,,,,,*Used to be good place* to chill and enjoy the food in Chicago. My last visit turned out to be the last time I will go to this place. 1/2 of the pork shoulder that I ordered is almost rare. I told the server and she instantly responded that it is perfectly cooked. I then asked her if you would have it at the stage. She said no way. Eating raw pork is very dangerous.
,,,,,I suggest coming with a group of 4-5 people so you can try a bunch of small plates. There is always a wait (no reservations) so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes or 1.5 hours on the weekend. It's more on the pricey side but it's worth giving it a try. Each plate is very tasty and flavorful and I don't think you'll be disappointed with anything on the menu. The food here is more on the salty side and it pairs well with wine. 
,,,,,"Grilled broccoli-yes, it's surprisingly good. Don't read the ingredients on the menu and just try it. You will be wondering what you are eating because it doesn't taste like broccoli at all"
,,,,,Roasted bone marrow-just get it. They are know for their bone marrow.
,,,,,Octopus-they only give you three pieces and a lot of asparagus and potatoes. Savor the octopus as much as you can. I wish they gave more octopus.
,,,,,Milk braised pork shoulder - melts in your mouth
,,,,,Crispy pig's ears-interesting but wouldn't recommend getting it
,,,,,"Festa di Santa Lucia crema - it's like a huge version of a puff but yummy filling inside (chocolate, ricotta). It is airy and a little hollow (wish there was more filling). It is also crispy on the outside. Overall, it was pretty good."
,,,,,Blood orange cake with goat milk ice cream- yeah it was worth the try but there was too much going on the plate. The flavors kinda clashed. 
,,,,,"Their dessert menu changes, but the festa di Santa Lucia crema is always on there!"
,,,,,This was a great small plates place for a late night dinner. The staff is incredibly friendly & helped us find it because there is currently construction outside so the door was hard to find. But once inside everything was perfect. Espresso martinis were on point!
,,,,,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! My friend took me here when I visited, and this became the highlight of my trip. We came on a Friday night at around 7pm, and the wait was an hour. "
,,,,,"It was very cramped inside. We sat in the corner of a shared table with 2 other parties. We ordered two glasses of rosé wine with Crispy Pig's Ear, Octopus a la Plancha, and Chicken Thigh Kabobs. "
,,,,,Crispy Pig's Ear - this took me by surprise! It's vastly different from the Asian style pig's ear with chili oil. It almost tasted like zucchini fries (I would've never guessed that it's pig's ear). It was fried with kale and topped with a sunny side up egg. The kale was SO good which totally blew me away because it was savory rather than bitter.
,,,,,Octopus a la Plancha - this was worth trying. The octopus legs was so tender it tasted more like fish. I prefer octopus that's chewy so I probably won't order this again. It was super flavorful nonetheless! 
,,,,,"Chicken Thigh Kabobs - this was divine. There were two skewers of chicken thigh. The meat was super tender and juicy, and the skin was perfectly crispy. It was so refreshing to eat it with tzatziki sauce. It came with a lot of roasted baked potatoes. Yum!"
,,,,,"The food was so good I didn't remember what the service was like. Overall, The Purple Pig is an attraction of its own. I'll definitely be back and I highly recommend eating here when visiting Chicago!"
,,,,,"Highly recommend this place! Came here for a simple dinner around 6pm (was barely getting packed, started becoming busy and packed around 7pm) and walked out blown away! I didn't expect the restaurant to be inside another building but it worked out as we got a table by the window. The place is a bit cramped inside so it all worked out with my big jacket and all."
,,,,,Service: Our server was great! He was very nice and came back multiple times to check up on us and we did not feel rushed at all even though we were there for an hour. All of the staff was very nice! 
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,-Half duck confit: MUST GET. The flavor was amazing due to the sauce (sweet and savory) and the yogurt sauce complimented perfectly along with the fish eggs. The meat was very tender and there was plenty of! The 2 tables next to us ended up ordering it after us as it looked irresistible. *drool*  
,,,,,"-Braised pork shoulder with kale: Delicious! Melted in my mouth... very tender, juicy and broke apart with a spoon. A huge portion of meat with mash potato and kale. I wished there was a bit more kale to balance out the the amount of meat. But overall another must try! "
,,,,,"-Roasted broccoli with anchovy: OH.MY.GOSH. Don't skip out on this. Super tasty!! It was a bit too salty for me to eat alone but it paired very nicely with the meats. I can eat the entire bowl myself. My bf LOVED them. I can see why everyone got this, because it's AMAZING. "
,,,,,-Drinks: (the cocktail list was different from the one they listed online as of Nov 2019)
,,,,,My bf got a wine/whiskey mix and he absolutely adored it. He had his fair share of drinks before and he have never had a drink like this. 
,,,,,I had the Elder mixed cocktail which was amazing. Perfectly balanced with the ginger and florals :) 
,,,,,"Overall, if I was in Chicago again, I would DEFINITELY come back here again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,"Purple Pig serves Mediterranean food in tapas style. With Yelp's recommendation, I got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder while my boyfriend got the Scialatielli al Nero. The pork shoulder was perfectly cooked; it was juicy, and it tore apart so easily. I enjoyed the crispy lentils that came with the dish. However, the meat can be a little overwhelming as there wasn't enough greens to pair it with. Scialatielli al Nero was full of seafood like mussels and shrimp. There was a hint of spiciness which made the dish more flavorful."
,,,,,"Wait can be long, so I suggest making a reservation beforehand."
,,,,,I'd recommend ordering 2 entrees or an entree + an appetizer per person.  
,,,,,"All in all, I had a great experience here and I can see myself making a visit here again."
,,,,,"We didn't have a reservation but were lucky to grab a couple of seats at the bar. I prefer that anyway because I like to be near the action sometimes and a good bartender can give make the experience so much more fun. We ordered the Ham Croquettes (I'm a mustard lover and this dish has mustard seed and a mustard aioli), the pork belly and tenderloin, and the lamb ribs. Delish! In my opinion we could've done without the ham croquettes because everything we ordered was very rich. I would have preferred the beets with goat cheese to add a little veggie to the decadent meats but I compromised. "
,,,,,We finished with the vanilla gelato and espresso and chose the drink pairing suggestion from the dessert menu and ordered the port wine to accompany. Perfection.
,,,,,Everything was delicious and the service was great. It was very crowded but it was a fun lively atmosphere and we had a great time!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Honestly giving this a two star because we received SO MANY recommendations to come here and after three weeks in Chicago, this was the worst meal we've had. We got the chicken thighs, the pork shoulder and the broccoli. The broccoli was ok but the main dishes were so salty, they weren't edible. I couldn't finish my dish and my boyfriend was starving so ate his. Honestly we just had higher expectations and this was a pricey place! They also took our dinners we hardly touched, didn't offer to pay for even one, or to wrap them. Not that we wanted them but like clearly they weren't good so make it right in some way. They did get two stars was because the staff was nice and attentive and we got in with no problem. Also very clean. Edit**** one star because we were both sick for the next 24 hours."
,,,,,Monday night was jam packed. I knew it would probably have a lot of people but this was busier than I anticipated and for good reason.
,,,,,"I'm not one to normally wine and dine but the menu made it so easy to order a glass! They have recommendations for wine pairings with each dish and as someone who doesn't usually drink, I needed all the help I could get. The pairing was perfect. I surprisingly really liked the white wine paired with my octopus dish."
,,,,,"My husband and I went here for his birthday dinner and it was worth the almost 2 hour wait... Yes, 2 hours! Luckily, we were able to get on the waitlist and walk around for a bit before coming in. Once we were seated, it made sense why this was a hot spot to be on a Saturday night. The restuarant looked really chic and elegant although seating was a bit tight to better accommodate more guests."
,,,,,"We ordered the Crispy Pig Ear, Roasted Bone Morrow, and the Pork Shoulder. The Crispy Pig Ears were a pleasant surprise from what we expected. It had kale and runny yolk to add a creaminess to the crunch of dish. The Bone Morrow was so delicious. It was served with bread, salt and capers and was unlike anything I've ever eaten. You could just soak up the flavor of the bone Morrison the bread. And lastly, the pork shoulder was served on mash potatoes with this delicious sauce! I could have used an extra side of the sauce by itself. So delicious!"
,,,,,Absolutely amazing food and Thr nee space allows for better dining experiences.     They've worked out any kink they had  and are full steam ahead
,,,,,"Good place for foodies and a place to try.  Do not like their obscure liquor choices, but the vino selection is pretty darned good.  "
,,,,,The wait...so obnoxiously long...it can take the wind out of your sails. 
,,,,,"If the hostesses and over abundance of floor staff moved more efficiently, the seating times and turn over would be a thousand times better.  "
,,,,,"Not a good first date place because of the extended wait times, but third-fifth, absolutely.  $$$"
,,,,,Very very very disappointed. For the amount of money we spent and considering the chef was a James beard recipient was beyond disappointed.
,,,,,"Everything we had was over salted and a couple items were almost inedible bc of how salty they were. The sauce with the octopus had why too much lemon, locked our jaws and over powered everything else. Service was terrible. Would not recommend to anyone who remotely enjoys food."
,,,,,"Some of the best things I have ever put in my mouth was at The Purple Pig restaurant in Chicago. This isn't just food, it's an experience. I'm convinced that each dish here is created by a magical culinary wizard that put countless though in everything cooked here. I had the pigs ear starter which gave my tastebuds a wonderful ride of flavors. Then came the milk braised pork shoulder... Best. Thing. In. The. World. "
,,,,,Tender/Juicy/Flavorful. It fell apart like fish but tasted like pork. Holy Sh*t sooo good. 
,,,,,"Finally I got the pork belly accompanied with a ginger carrot sauce. The sauce was amazing and the pork belly was fatty and flavorful without being chewy at all. The cherry on the sundae was my waiter, Hebert. He was extremely passionate and knowledgeable about everything on the menu and made my dining experience very pleasurable. In my opinion, this is one of the restaurants in the Chicago area."
,,,,,"This restaurant is fantastic. Came here on the recommendation from a friend and I am glad I did. I started with the salt roasted roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter.  This app was the perfect flavor combination, I love beets and the whipped goat cheese was airy and light the pistachio butter was an unexpected treat not the most appealing visually but the taste was the perfect pairing with the beets and cheese.  I had the roasted bone marrow with herbs, capers, onions and maldon sea salt for my entree.  So decadent and delicious, I wish I came here with other people so I could try more items.  I left here absolutely stuffed!"
,,,,,"Located in what appears to be an office building, it's surprising to find this very cool restaurant. Delicious cocktails and a good wine list can be found in this upscale modern bistro that's filled with working locals. The food was solid, the artichokes stealing the show. Interesting meats like pork shoulder were tasty and homey, service was attentive. Really enjoyed my late"
,,,,,"lunch here, it was relaxed and yummy!"
,,,,,Amazing appetizers! The arancini and the salted beets were a huge hit at our table. The entrees were excellent as well. Some of the best food to be had in Chicago. Totally worth it!!
,,,,,Yes! Yes! I will come back and you're definitely worth the wait. 
,,,,,In the chances that I get hangry I was still at a state where I could wait. When we were told it's a 30 mins wait we felt lucky as all the previous wait times said 2 hrs or so on average. Ended up being a little over 30 mins but for a friday night at a place like this? Probably a score!
,,,,,Atmosphere: it's a cute place where I could see people coming on dates. The tables were close so that you'll have to leave into talk ;) it reminded me of a few cured meat wine bars in Italy and had a cute homey feel. 
,,,,,Service: was pretty quick for orders to be loved and food to be out. Once the seating had occurred it was actually not bad at all
,,,,,Now for the food: one word in summary: amazing
,,,,,There were things more up my alley and things I didn't have minded trying but may trying something else the next time. 
,,,,,1. My favorite had to be the cuttlefish: when the dish was over I was wanting more! The cuttlefish was cooked to perfection where you had a taste of chat on the outside but was so soft and tender on the inside! Paired with charcoal bread (which was ok) and a perfect blend of what seemed like mostly salty bean sauce and a citrus yellow sauce all meshed to form a Harmony in my mouth 
,,,,,2. Butternut squash: I am not a huge veggie person but this I didn't mind it. It was perfectly cooked with a thin layer of celery on top that gave it an interesting fresh kick. It was good just not worth the value for me.
,,,,,"3. Roasted bone marrow: this wasn't pretty good. Well.cooked.and spread on a perfecy toasted piece of bread topped off with a green citrousy salad that wiped the oiliness off. One of my friends can't really eat cilantro and this salad had some in it, which for me added a lot to the flavor palate. However if you can't eat the salad it may be a tad too oily for you."
,,,,,4. Last but not least: the infamous milk braised pork shoulder With mashed potatoes and gravy
,,,,,The pork was so tender and the potatoes were so creamy. The combo in your mouth was just the perfect balance of melting in my mouth. I could see why it was one of the most popular dishes to be ordered! I would definitely get this again
,,,,,Me and my friend were eyeing a dish on the way in which I have now learnt is the duck confit so that will be the next thing to try when I go back :)
,,,,,There were 3 of us and given we were not too hungry to start with these 4 filled us up pretty good. If I was hungry it could have been maybe 5-6 between the 3 of us which is how many they recommended :)
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,I ordered the salted beets as an appetizer and for my main dish I had two orders of the chicken kebabs. 
,,,,,Both of the dishes were absolutely amazing and my entire family who I dined with... was very impressed with the food. 
,,,,,The staff was extremely friendly and willing to go above and beyond to ensure that we had a great time. 
,,,,,The ambience of this place is absolutely amazing and I will definitely be back. I wish I would've asked my servers for their names because they definitely deserve the recognition.
,,,,,Pork
,,,,,"Chop was great but the squid ink pasta was just ketchup sauce, really disappointing, eww, really??"
,,,,,"We won't come back here,"
,,,,,Found this place by accident. How lucky am I? Outstanding food. Great service. Can't wait to go back.
,,,,,"I went here three years ago and gave it 5 stars. I was raving so much to my bf about how great this restaurant is and finally I set a reservation for us on Saturday at 630. I ordered exactly what I did three years ago cause even to this day I remembered how delicious each dish was. Dishes ordered were the bone marrow, octopus, pork shoulder. My bf ordered the a pasta dish. Each of the orders were a complete let down. The marrow was extremely small that we could only use two pieces of bread. The octopus was covered in lemon and you could not taste much else. The pork should which I was extremely excited for since it was the most tender piece of meat I've ever had, was a bit dry and lack luster. The pasta was good but nothing to write home about. Although, the drink I ordered was delish, it was a mezcal drink but I can't remember the name. I also ordered the espresso with ice cream but it didn't come out til my bf was done with his drink, I almost forgot about it. Are server was great though. Unfortunately though we both left dissatisfied and disappointed. We even heard a guest as we were leaving that said it didn't taste as good as last time she came, not sure what she was eating though. Sucks after talking it up so much.. most likely will not be back."
,,,,,"Great service! Was actually able to get a seat right away. I got the bone marrow to start. I've never tried it before and it was amazing. i got the octopus and it was tender and delicious. The pork shoulder was so juicy and literally just fell apart, no knife needed. All in all small portions but crazy good flavor. I will be back!"
,,,,,One of my favorite places to eat in downtown Chicago -never fails to be delicious! There is a bit of a wait but the text system works well and gives you time to shop or chill out with wine before your table is ready.
,,,,,"We were inside where it is a bit fast paced and loud, but has a European feel and upbeat energy. Our waiter helped recommend a perfect wine for our meal. We are vegetarians/vegans but always find tasty options here."
,,,,,My highlight is the beet salad followed closely by the cauliflower and then the olives. My husband lived the gnocchi which was light and yet filling.
,,,,,We will be back for sure! I highly recommend coming here whenever in Chicago!
,,,,,Place has changed. Used to wait in line for PP. Food was inventive provoking. 
,,,,,Bread a simple important base here was crusty chewy now more like soft Texas toast. Menu has really changed and it's too bad
,,,,,This is another one of my favorite spots in Chicago that I am a little late on reviewing that definitely warrants some good attention. The Purple Pig is one of the more well-known food establishments off Magnificent Mile that we knew we had to try going as walk-ins. We were there on a weekday in May and were hungry for some good food after a 90-minute long boat tour.
,,,,,We ordered a few different dishes as their portions were relatively smaller. 
,,,,,"DRINKS 5/5: I ordered a fancy Spanish gin and tonic with tarragon and this adorable stainless steel stirrer/straw. We also ordered a non-alcoholic soda which had flavors of pink guava, sage and peppercorn; 'twas interesting as well. "
,,,,,"FOOD 4/5: Overall, everything was delicious but not something I'd go out of my way to try again. The food was presented beautifully but in general, it didn't click. Some dishes were too salty for my liking and didn't have enough flavor. Others were excellent. The milk-braised pork shoulder was my favorite and it was fantastic from beginning to end. The crispy pig ears weren't that great, but fun to munch on. The mussels and the robust tomato sauce were alright as well. I also enjoyed their pasta with the ground pork mea; I was unable to find the name of the dish on the online menu. "
,,,,,What I'm trying to say is that the food was a hit or a miss for me. The ambiance was very classy yet casual. The wait for the restrooms was unfortunate as there was only one or two for customers and employees to use. The place offers indoor and outdoor seating which was beautiful for a sunny day like the one we visited. The service was top-notch as well. 
,,,,,PARKING
,,,,,Not sure. We took an Uber everywhere
,,,,,"Great spot - the food was delicious and wine incredible. Thanks to the sommelier's recommendations on the menu! The Beets we're beautifully plated and easy to eat. The humus was the scene stealer, garlic smooth and on toasted bread. Service was attentive and great atmosphere."
,,,,,Amazing food! It can get pretty crowded around the peak hours but the food was worth it

,,,,,As always.  My favorite place in Chicago. 
,,,,, Drafts  beer and octopus was perfect lunch for me. My friends also loved pork shoulder Bucatini pasta and Bone narrow.
,,,,,Pasta was little salty. sliced bacon makes it more salty.

,,,,,The bone marrow is stand out. Will be back next time we're in Chicago. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"Came here on a friend's recommendation. We stopped by between 3-4pm on a Monday and didn't have to make reservations or wait for a table. Since it was a rather random time to eat, we just ordered a few items: pork belly, chicken kebabs, fried manchego, and pig ears. The star of the dishes was probably the pork belly since the taste was a little more complex, but the chicken kebabs is a good and safe runner up. While I'd come here again to try other items on the menu, I would not recommend the other two dishes."
,,,,,"Such a fun time. The long tables are so communal, and the place is purple and dimly lit and everyone is talking and having a good time. The food is spectacular and creative, but funny enough, the best thing I had on the menu wasn't pork - it was duck! The drinks were good, and everyone had a good time. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago ."
,,,,,"5 stars for food, 1 star for service "
,,,,,"The food was outstanding! Everything we got was so flavorful and there are many satisfying veggie options to balance out the meat and seafood. I'd love to come back to try more, except..."
,,,,,"Service started strong and then fell off a cliff when an entitled, oversized ""VIP"" table sat next to us. Suddenly our server was nowhere to be found, our glasses sat empty, and staff kept trying to clear the plates we were still working on. As more people joined the already-full table, they hovered inches away from us and glared at us. We distinctly felt that we were being pressured to leave and give up the table--despite the fact that we had a reservation, had been there for less than an hour, and were still trying to order more things (if and when the server checked in again). The manager spent considerable time and attention to going over wines with this group, seeming not to notice or care what was happening at any other tables on a busy Saturday night. Special treatment is lovely but shouldn't come at the expense of all the other customers."
,,,,,Actually I changed my mind. Sometimes it takes time to learn what true greatness really is.
,,,,,"I was really looking forward to going here for a long time because I saw that the reviews here were all praising this place so much. We were actually seated super quickly which I was surprised at because another night I came with a friend and we were told that we'd have to wait for three hours. It's really not all it's hyped out to be here. What you're really doing is vastly overpaying for mediocre food that is really quite small portions unless you want to dish out enough money to actually be able to be full after eating at this restaurant. Our waiter was actually really helpful--I don't recommend getting the desserts here though. They were nothing special at all. The only dish I would go out of my way to have again was the fried polenta appetizer. Other than that, you can definitely go somewhere better and cheaper to have a more appetizing meal that's better for your wallet overall. Glad I finally went though, so now I know and can tell other people not to believe that it's one of the best in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Busy place, but good service. I had the Pork Shoulder, my friend had the Chicken kebabs. Both were perfect. I will be back."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig would fit right in to the NYC food scene. Once we were in and seated, it really did remind me of a hip tappas place in NY. We visited on a Monday a little after the typical lunch rush. We were seated at the bar that literally looks straight into the kitchen so you can see exactly how dishes are put together. "
,,,,,"Believe the hype in the other reviews and definitely try the fried pigs ears! So much richness with the slivers of fried pigs ear and kale, but the pickled peppers counter it nicely. We shared the braised pork shoulder, and it was phenomenal! Their cocktail list is fabulous too. I can't recommend it enough. "
,,,,,"The service was excellent, and while we were discussing the crystal clear ice cube in one of our drinks, one of the managers (I think) helpfully offered that they make it in a big block and then cut out the clear parts. I love tidbits of knowledge like that! They bring out the food when it's ready so you aren't going to have everything at once. Small plates are the way to go. You get to try some of a few different dishes, and you leave completely satisfied!"
,,,,,"Not gonna lie, I'm normally a non-believer in fancy cuisine, but my friend who was visiting wanted to come here, and now I can't wait to go back. We came early and enjoyed being the only guests for brunch. It's a beautiful restaurant with great service. All three dishes we tried, we liked."
,,,,,"Today was my first day here and I am honestly at a loss for words. This experience has been one for the books. From the food, to the drinks & service, everything was absolutely perfect. "
,,,,,"Our server Julian and the GM Vanessa showed the best hospitality I have experienced in a while. From the moment we walked in, Julian and Vanessa welcomed us with great care and respect. They recommended amazing drinks, (Ederly Axl & Negroni) and it was to die for. "
,,,,,We ordered the Hanger Steak and it was made to perfection. This is a must place to visit when visiting Chicago!
,,,,,Overall rating: 3.5 stars
,,,,,"I had to come here during my trip to Chicago a few months ago after seeing all the positive reviews and recommendations for this place. This place was already so packed even around 5:30pm, with a wait time of well over an hour. Luckily there are a lot of shops nearby so you could walk around while you wait (we actually did this before going to the restaurant because we didn't expect it to be so crowded). When we arrived the waitress said if we were okay with patio seating, she did have 2 seats available immediately. At first I wanted to wait for indoor seating because it was so cold outside, but she emphasized that the patio was heated, so we agreed to be seated there. "
,,,,,"Unfortunately the table we received was right next to the door so we had a lot of people walking by or standing next to our table waiting which was kind of awkward. The overhead heaters were also laughably weak. I could barely feel anything and was cold during my whole meal, which made it hard to enjoy. Granted I'm from SoCal but even our patio heaters are much stronger and we don't even need them most of the time. I think if you sat more towards the inner part of the patio it might have been a little warmer there. Or they could put down the plastic door flap that serves as the patio entrance, in order to keep more heat in. Because it was cold I also felt rushed to eat our food before it got cold. I think in the colder months waiting for indoor seating would definitely be worth it. "
,,,,,"Food-wise, everything we ordered was delicious, with my favorite being the roasted bone marrow. However, prices were pretty steep. $14 for gnocci and $13 for potatoes was not worth it in my opinion, for such a small serving size and for something you can do easily make yourself. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. I'd say get 3-5 because I was still hungry after 2. The bone marrow was worth it though in my opinion - so rich and melts in your mouth! "
,,,,,"Overall, I liked the food here but didn't think it was worth the price and wait. If you come when it's not busy then I'd recommend checking it out especially for the bone marrow, but I wouldn't wait hours to be seated here."

,,,,,"Got lost as my last time here was 2018, and it's moved to a new location, located within an office building. "
,,,,,I had the:
,,,,,Pappardelle--yummy!
,,,,,"Grilled Portuguese Sardines--disappointing as the cook allowed the oil smoke to envelope the fish, so it had a burnt oil flavor. Was tough to compete with what I had in Barcelona. "
,,,,,"Lamb chops--tasty, but a little to dry in parts"
,,,,,"Blueberry sorbet--was quite tart, unfortunately not in season"
,,,,,"Both times, went to sit at the bar, where it's first come first serve versus waiting an hour+. This second time though, felt that the food wasn't as good as it was when it used to be all about the food. Caveat is that I purposely ordered different things this time around. "
,,,,,The overall star rating reflects the bill ($65) versus the food quality.
,,,,,"We didn't have reservations so sat along the kitchen bar. This place was a delight! Our favorite dish was the whipped feta, though each of the three we ordered was very tasty. Easy to find enough for a vegetarian also. Service was excellent!"
,,,,,"Almost 3 years later, The Purple Pig was just as good as I remember so A+ for consistency. TPP also makes my FAVORITE version of bone marrow & I've had bone marrow all over the states at this point & even make it at home. "
,,,,,"This time, my dining companion & I had the: "
,,,,,"*Roasted Bone Marrow (Herb Salad + Sicilian Sea Salt) -  as mentioned above -- seriously the best prep of bone marrow I've ever had. Yes, it's $19 for one bone marrow + some bread + herbs, but it's worth it. "
,,,,,"*Whipped Feta (Date Crackers, Saffron Pickled Leeks + Snow Peas) - the date crackers are so unique and add a sweetness to balance the savory & tangy feta. The feta texture was SO luxurious. I wish there were more date crackers because we had a ton of feta left."
,,,,,"*Bavette Steak (Black Garlic A1, Sweet Potato + Bone Marrow-Pear Butter) - THE BLACK GARLIC A1 was out of this world - so much umami. It was perfectly balanced with all the elements on the plate & of course, the steak was PERFECTLY medium rare. "
,,,,,"*Secreto (Red Pepper, Meyer Lemon Relish + Scallion) - this followed the bavette steak so it's hard to complete when the flavor of this is so bright & light. Regardless, it's rare for restaurants to have this cut (like the skirt steak of pork) and it's PERFECTLY cooked. Not a dry piece of meat in sight. "
,,,,,I let our server pick the wine & he picked an awesome Sicilian red (Nerello Mascalese) that went with everything since we picked a smattering of dishes/flavor profiles.
,,,,,Long overdue review! The Purple Pig is one of my favorite restaurants in Chi-town. I liked it better than The Girl & The Goat. 
,,,,,It was packed but we came a little after 1pm so we were seated relatively quickly. 
,,,,,"*Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt: One of the best bone marrow dishes I've had - hands down. The herb salad helps to add a freshness to the rich, decadent marrow. Add a dash of Sicilian sea salt and you're good to go. "
,,,,,"*Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg - In LA, The Church Key makes something sort of similar (Pig Ear Cheetos) but this is way better. The runny egg adds some creaminess to the fried deliciousness. The kale & pickled cherry peppers also help break up the swiney-ness. "
,,,,,*Foie Gras - Beautifully plated dish & wonderful consistency. 
,,,,,"If you can, sit on the patio! Because the place is packed, it's incredibly loud inside. I enjoyed Summer CHI weather + being able to hear my then boyfriend! "
,,,,,"Now that I'm much closer to Chicago, I definitely need to make a trip up to the Windy City for The Purple Pig."
,,,,,"I was a huuuge fan of the previous location - even though it was small, it was intimate and the ambiance was just amazing. I didn't know they moved half a block down to their new location, so when I finally found it, I was surprised at how big it was! I don't think the ambiance measures up to what it was before, but it was still pretty nice. "
,,,,,"Even with the bigger space, the wait seems to be just as long. I got lucky and got a seat at the bar (by myself) within 15 minutes. "
,,,,,"I asked about some of the favorites and ordered the broccoli and pork belly. They were both huge portions, which personally I would prefer smaller portions (as tapas should be). I could barely eat half of the plates I ordered, and was disappointed I couldn't try any other dishes. "
,,,,,"The broccoli, although seems like such a boring plate to order, was so delicious. It had this sauce on it that was creamy with a crunch factor - I'd definitely recommend this! The pork belly and tenderloin were cooked very well and super tender. Some of the items it came with, like the pickled carrots, helped balance out the flavors nicely. "
,,,,,"Go here for a drink, for a couple tapas, bring your friends to try everything - whatever way it is, just go."
,,,,,"I think I've written a total of 2 review in my life, but I felt I needed to for this restaurant. Came here for my birthday because I heard it was a good spot. The food was tasty, but our server was unfriendly and a little rude. Didn't seem to want to answer questions about the food and hardly paid attention to our table-- which is weird because he seemed friendly and talkative enough to the table next to us."
,,,,,"Honestly wish we had a different server (the other server working seemed really friendly), as unfortunately, this ruined the experience for us and we ended up going somewhere else for dessert because we wanted a more positive experience. Literally bare minimum of answering questions and a smile? If the service was better, I most likely would have given 5 stars. I don't think I'll be back."
,,,,,"More like 3.5 stars. The name Purple Pig certainly caught my attention. This place is known for their cheese, cured meats and wine. Many of their dishes are more like tapas where you can share."
,,,,,"The first thing we noticed right away was how noisy and crowded the place was. There are only 2-4 table seating at an outside enclosed patio. Inside, the same, 2-4 table seating and then a large communal table. They sat us at the communal table with tall, unstable and wobbly barstools. You're practically sitting elbow to elbow with the person next to you. Same goes for the table seatings. Not my favorite way to dine. You have those awkward moments where you try not to look at the other patrons."
,,,,,"When you take the time to look through the menu and finally decide on the dish you want and then they come back 10 minutes later telling you that it's not available, you get bummed. Then you quickly look through the menu again and chances are, you'll make a hasty decision. And yeah, that's what happened. We chose the Ricotta Gnocchi filled with tomato sauce to replace the homemade meatballs. I didn't love the dish and the tomato sauce overtook the pasta. I found myself wiping some of the sauce off before eating them. Nothing special."
,,,,,"Since the place specialize in all things pork, we decided on the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. The meat could have been more tender, it was tasty but again, it didn't wow me but was enjoyable enough. We also had the Crispy Pigs Ears with kale and fried egg. This dish was quite nice. "
,,,,,"Maybe it was the noise factor, the crowded seating and the fact that they ran out of the item I really wanted that made for a mediocre dining experience. I really wanted them homemade meatballs."
,,,,,Amazing and very attentive staff. Our waiter kept coming over multiple times to make sure everything was good and asked if we liked the food.
,,,,,"Literally nothing you can order here will let you down. Loved our experience and the food and the drinks, and appreciated the owner (and chef) checking in on all the tables to make sure the food and experience was meeting our expectations."
,,,,,Great service and great food. Get the bone marrow or some charcuterie. Or both. Our server had a Gucci shirt that said Gnochi instead. COME ON!!!  how cool is that? Also he was a great server. Especially since COVID has made it so difficult for the servers and bartenders in the industry. I would highly recommend it. Actually an old chef of mine suggested we go there after we already had. So that means chefs like it. Just go.
,,,,,"Wow the three of us really enjoyed our dinner last night. Crispy pig ear, seafood squid ink pasta, pork belly, tuna tartare, and pork blade steak were all delicious.  Service and ambiance were both good. One of our favorite meal during our one week visit."
,,,,,The decor of Purple Pig was pretty and elegant. They didn't take reservation and we came here before they opened so we didn't wait for long. 
,,,,,Most of their dishes were delicate and great. Our favorites were their roasted bone marrow with herbs and fried pig ear. The roasted bone marrow was awesome with grilled brioche came with order but kind of greasy if you try it alone. Fried pig ear with fried kale was crispy and amazingly delicious to dip in egg yolk before eating. We didn't recommend their milk braised pork shoulder since it was little dry inside. 
,,,,,"One more of our recommendation was their dessert. Sicilian Iris was definitely a must try! When you cut the Sicilian iris, cream and chocolate flood out, you would feel satisfied with both vision and taste."

,,,,,"With its sit-down ambiance and meat-forward menu, The Purple Pig was not really on my radar until a couple of weeks ago when I noticed the chalkboard signs for take-out drinks and tacos. Sold! I spontaneously stopped in here last Friday for carry-out. As other reviewers mentioned, the restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Corner Bakery. It was awesome to see the transformation and I had fun looking around at the wine-related quotes on the walls as my order was being prepared. The day I visited, the carryout drink specials were an aperol spritz and a house red wine, both for $10. I probably would opt for the aperol spritz, or other creative cocktail, next time around. The tacos were awesome. I went with the carnitas and highly recommend. The pork was expertly braised, without any fatty parts. A steal at $9 for two tacos, both a bit larger than street taco size."
,,,,,"If you are craving for Mediterranean and American food or even Tapas, The Purple Pig restaurant is perfect for it. You can choose various dishes in here. If you want vegetables, they have grilled broccoli, salt roasted beets and Greek salad. For snacks they have whipped feta, pork liver bacon plate and crispy pigs ears. They also have pork jowl, pork blade steak, bone marrow and more if you want meat. You can also have handmade orecchiette and ricotta gnocchi if you like pasta. Grilled squid calamari, scallops and more for seafood. Additionally, you can also choose your drinks and desserts. These foods they have has a good plating making it look attractive and the taste are all delicious. The place is clean and has a cool ambiance and good customer service."
,,,,,Meh. Our friends raved about Purple Pig when they visited Chicago and they even came back to back days. It did not meet my expectations at all. We came for a late dinner with no reservations but they were able to seat us pretty quick. 
,,,,,The waiter recommended us to order 3 dishes if we weren't super hungry. We decided on:
,,,,,"- Milk braised pork shoulder: it was ok, the meat was soft and fell apart easily. Definitely a strong milk flavor. "
,,,,,"- Octopus: was the most excited about this dish since it was what our friends came back twice for. The dish was delicious BUT it only came with THREE pieces of octopus and the rest were potatoes and green beans. We felt so ripped off, we ended up texting our group chat asking if their portions were just as small. She said there was no way it was only 3 pieces and ended up sending us a picture of her dish when she dined at purple pig. There was probably 5x the amount of what we got. "
,,,,,"- Bavette Steak: wasn't a fan of the flavors, I think it came with a sweet cranberry like sauce with sweet potatoes on the bottom. We ordered this medium and it came under cooked. At this point we didn't feel like sending it back"
,,,,,"Overall, didn't really have a pleasant experience. Not sure if I would return."
,,,,,I always love the food. So many great choices and excellent presentation and preparation. You have to try it!!
,,,,,We came here after a quick visit to cloud gate at millennium park nearby; it did not disappoint.
,,,,,"There was a heated seating area as it was quite cold outside (for May) and a cozy interior that was on the verge of cramped on the interior of the restaurant. The food here is aggressive and hearty in a more tapas style, plates can definitely be shared."
,,,,,"The multitude of pork products we ordered was the crispy pig ear salad, pork liver pate, pork tongue, pork sausage orecchiette, milk braised pork  shoulder. These weren't the only dishes we ordered, which also included the bone barrow, whipped feta, and three desserts. All the savory dishes were excellent I had no real complaints of them as I feel they were executed well and had a multitude of textures and seasonings that felt great on the palette. "
,,,,,"I will have to deduct a star on the desserts as they were somewhat lazily prepared. The loukoumades didn't have any particular care put into them as they were kind of plopped on a plate with a lazy pool of honey. The vanilla panna cotta was precisely that; the texture was that of a firm tofu but nothing really made me think ""WOW"" while eating it. Also, the trio of gelato and sorbet were decent, the roasted white chocolate being the standpoint as it had a depth of layered flavor which we both appreciated. "
,,,,,I would definitely come here again and even give another try for the different desserts if I am in Chicago again. Cheers!
,,,,,"Delicious!  I visited this restaurant when it first opened years ago and it has held up!  Delicious food and great wait staff. We had the pate, burrata, crispy pigs ears and ribs. Everything was delicious except the pigs ears which were bland and unseasoned."
,,,,,"Great service. Wonderful food. The taste of everything is phenomenal, outstanding quality and taste. The presentation of every dish is beautiful, the belong on the four seasons or the Ritz. Highly recommend, must do when visiting Chicago :)"
,,,,,"Friendly and helpful staff. Clean restrooms with good smelling soap and very moisturizing lotion. Although street parking is available, walking or public transportation are better ways of getting there. This restaurant is located near a lot of stores for those who are interested in shopping nearby. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. I did feel, however, rushed to eat and get out even though I was only a table for 2 eating at 4:30pm.  "
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"An an appetizer, we tried the Whipped Feta with Date crackers, saffron, pickled leeks, snow peas, and watercress. This appetizer was fresh, light, clean and delicious!"
,,,,,We also ordered salt-roasted beets served with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter. The beets were seasoned just right and the lightly whipped goat cheese complimented this dish very well. 
,,,,,"For lunch, we ordered the Milk braised Berkshire Shoulder served with mashed potatoes and crispy lentils.  The pork was tender and the crispy lentils were a nice surprise; it provided great texture. There was an additional flavor on the pork that didn't compliment it, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped to."
,,,,,Kyle was our server and he provided great recommendations!
,,,,,"Reviewing as someone who doesn't eat meat. I recently stopped eating meat but wanted to try this place because of all the amazing recommendations from friends. My friends did however order the meat dishes so I will pass on their reviews for it too. I enjoyed all of the dishes we chose! Mushrooms 3 ways was basically 3 diff types of mushroom made differently in one dish. It was a grilled mushroom topped with some type of truffle purée and a cold pickled radish/mushroom salad on top of that! Next best was the ravioli. It's just one ravioli and the cheese was so creamy! This dish is very flavorful with truffle all over. The cauliflower was a basic dish but definitely not bad. I was basically eating bougie veggies here  now for the meat: One of my friends ordered the turkey leg and I think that was the best thing at this restaurant. I tried a small piece of it and it was so tender and slid right off the bone, not to mention the sauce that was all over it, really made it delicious. Another friend tried the bone marrow and said it was amazing and one of the best bone marrow he has ever tried. They also ordered the grilled octopus and orecchiette which looked really tasty! We ate everything we ordered and were all really satisfied with our meal."
,,,,,"TL:DR - Service was great for me, despite what other people said. The food is top notch. Noteable is the hotdog and duck prosciutto. Serving size is larger than tapas sizes, but a tad smaller than regular entrees. I'd budget about 1.5 plates per person in your party. Place can get a bit tight and loud."
,,,,,"O man, this place is delicious. It's tucked away inside of a office or residential building, which is kind of weird. But whatever. A lot of people have docked stars for bad service, rather than issues with the food. But I just wanted to start by saying we had a great server and the wait staff that brought out the food were all super friendly and informative."
,,,,,"My big question coming to this place was whether it was a tapas place or not. It's really an inbetween. Like just off portion sizes, it's much bigger than tapas sizes, but not really enough for a single plate to fill you up. We ended up getting 3 plates and some charcuterie for two people and while we finished it, we were STUFFED."
,,,,,"Food wise, we got the meatball special, which had three types of meat (wagyu, veal, and I forget), duck prosciutto, bone marrow, and their hot dog. I personally have never had marrow before this, and wasn't super impressed with it. It honestly is just fat that makes delicious food more delicious. Like it came with some garlic toast, cilantro salad, and salt. I could have just eaten the bread and salad with salt by itself and been happy. So I won't comment on the marrow. The hotdog was easily my favorite though. This could and should really be a one person entree. It's a full hot dog and literally smashed roasted potatoes. But the hotdog came with a sweet mustard topping with pickled green strawberries, and each ingredient brought something different. Warm sweetness from the mustard, picked sweetness from the strawberries, salty meatiness from the hotdog, and a super soft bun made for an amazing experience. Easily my favorite of the night. The duck prosciutto was also new to me. The depth of this meat was ridiculous. It first hits with that familiar fatty duck flavor, but then keeps going with a very very deep ummami flavor. So hard to describe, you just need to experience. The meatballs were good. They were soft and paired with their whipped cheese and salad was good. But no where near the other two."
,,,,,"Overall, this place was good. The ambiance was a bit loud. The tables are really tight together, but I'll put up with it for the food."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,One of the best meals we ever had.
,,,,,The drinks were great.
,,,,,"The food was delicious. We ordered three sides, each larger than expected. Two of the three were recommendations from the waiter -- a broccoli dish and tuna tartare -- and they were great, no complaints."
,,,,,"Dessert was a feta/Oreo cheesecake -- as good as Junior's in Brooklyn which is to say very, very good."
,,,,,"On the way out, we spoke briefly with the owner who gave all credit for his business to his kitchen workers, and we can't disagree!"
,,,,,"By way of background, we discovered this place indirectly. We searched Apple Maps for tapas near us and went to our choice. We arrived and were told that even though the place was literally about 90% empty, they were not taking walk-ins til hours later. So back in Maps. Maps' listings tend to reference Yelp rankings; Purple Pig instead was noted as being cited by Chefs Feed, that is, IMO, more impressive than a Yelp ranking by definition. And we were not disappointed-- and appreciate the rejection at the first place."
,,,,,"I was hesitant on trying a tapa restaurant for dinner because I wasn't sure if it was going to be filling for the price. Boy, was I wrong! We got about 5 plates, including dessert and I was stuffed! There was definitely a wait (around 2 hours for us), so get there early and put your name down. "
,,,,,"Once you get inside, it is busy! Every single table was full and sometimes it is a tight squeeze, yet the staff make the wait seem less with ordering and food coming out fast. I believe they are also expanding since I also saw coming soon Purple Pig signs at other locations. "
,,,,,"Full menu to choose from, but I definitely recommend the stuffed squid and pig ears - it's hard to have a favorite since everything is delicious and exquisitely made, worthy of the Michelin Star name."
,,,,,"I LOVEDDDDD this place! Everything was so delicious, from the fried manchego to the whipped feta (THE BEST), and the broccoli. The broccoli doesn't sound so exciting, but it had so much flavor that we loved it! "
,,,,,"We were worried that we would have to wait a long time, but we ended up not having to wait! We did walk in at around 4:30 on a Friday though. Go early, I highly recommend! "
,,,,,"The drink was fantastic too! It wasn't as expensive as I expected this place to be, considering all of the high reviews. "
,,,,,I will definitely come back again if I ever come back to Chicago!
,,,,,Amazing. Shout out to ambrosio (spell check). He is the backbone of this restaurant. 
,,,,,Fried Pig ears were very good. 
,,,,,Eggplant capanota 
,,,,,Pork spare ribs AMAAZING 
,,,,,I enjoyed everything here. Oink oink.
,,,,,Most of the items on their menu are novelty dishes. You want to try each once. But none of them are particularly memorable. It's great to have a restaurant like this to take out-of-town visitors looking for something unique. Certainly it's better than having yet another steak house or pizzeria.
,,,,,We had a fantastic time here.  Long wait but put our name in and returned when we received the message.  The service was great!  He had pork belly- which was phenomenal.  The shank was delicious.  They even made me Parmesan fries - off the menu.  Definitely try this place .  Hope we return.
,,,,,A great place to stop by in Chicago. Try to reserve a table ahead of time to make sure you don't have to wait an hour or more. Definitely great service and good recommendations. Will definitely come back to try new things next time!
,,,,,I came here back when indoor dining was still a thing. I had heard the food was absolutely delicious here and they did not disappoint. We got their crispy pig's ear and potato ice cream and caviar with a bottle of riesling. Everything was delicious and the flavor combinations were so unique! Who thinks of potato ice cream let alone combining it with caviar?? But it all ended up working really well together. The riesling was also really good and paired well with the food.
,,,,,I came here for dinner after a show during peak dinner hours and the wait was actually a lot shorter than I expected. I left my name and walked around and I got a notification about 15mins that my table was ready. The atmosphere is casual and loud. The seating was a bit tight and my table was very close to the tables beside me. 
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,"In terms of food, I enjoyed most of the dishes I had. My favorites included the octopus and the bucatini. There was one dish that I didn't like which is the milk braised berkshire shoulder. The item seemed interesting so I decided to give it a try. The pork was tender but I didn't love the flavor profile of it. "
,,,,,OVERALL:
,,,,,I enjoyed most of the foods that I had and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
,,,,,Love this spot! Always a great time! Service is always impeccable and the food is always amazing.

,,,,,You must do yourself a favor and dine here at Purple Pig!
,,,,,"In terms of service...The staff was incredibly attentive, anticipated our requests and I was literally unable to get my water glass more than half empty the entire meal."
,,,,,"The food was spectacular and cooked perfectly; and the kale on the pig ears was, hands-down, the most fantastic kale I have ever had."
,,,,,I would not even hesitate to say that this was the best service and dining experience I've had...even including non-Covid dining experiences.
,,,,,"Went for Sunday brunch. Honestly, the food is very salty. I liked the broccoli and pork belly the most. We ordered the jowl, bone marrow, pork shoulder, and a few other items. None really stood out flavor wise. The cocktails were divine though."
,,,,,"Additionally, one server wore a tie-dye hoodie with joggers and sneakers. Not exactly high standards for a fancy restaurant in my opinion. They were careful when it came to COVID standards and I appreciated that. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd come back."
,,,,,"This restaurant is my favorite one in Chicago. Great ambiance, amazing dishes. What gets me is the sheer consistency of their food and how good it is. Broccoli dish is amazing, pork shank is amazing. Highly recommend The Purple Pig. I've lived in Chicago for almost a decade now, and is by far the best restaurant downtown!"
,,,,,Braised pork shank was amazing amazing amazing. Their broccoli is also great. Highly recommend those two items. Can't say everything was perfect; waiter was kind of slow. But otherwise those two dishes were just fantastic!
,,,,,TAPAS! 
,,,,,The warm olives are a delightfully salty bite that goes perfectly with a glass of wine. 
,,,,,"The whipped feta-I could eat it everyday. Tangy, crunchy, fresh. The perfect plate. "
,,,,,"The octopus is filling without being heavy, light pesto and roasted potatoes. "
,,,,,Big fan. We'll be back!
,,,,,Phenomenal tapas and extensive drink menu. They have experienced staffs climbing up the ladder to get your wine because there are  SO MANY WINES. The new location follows a lot of the old layout with an open kitchen. I didn't see any outdoor seating which is a bummer as they're now located in a commercial or residential building. I ordered a very simple meal - charted broccoli and dry rose. (I had went to pequods right before and wasn't so hungry after stuffing down a personal pan deep dish).  
,,,,,The charred broccoli while sounds simple I promise it's anything but that. So flavor with the pairing sauce and the char that was done beautifully. 
,,,,,They don't take reservations so you have to go put your name down but general waiting time is about an hour. I was lucky to grab a bar seat and didn't have to wait at all. Highly recommend this spot if you're in the area.

,,,,,"I always thought restaurants like these were overrated, giving tiny portions for exorbitant prices. Given how these plates were tapas style and meant to be shared, I knew the price was high. My friend and I came around 4:30 on a Monday, when you think the crowds would be low. But, in fact, I was wrong. The whole restaurant was close to packed! "
,,,,,"We were looking for a small snack before dinner so we went with the fried manchego and the duck. We were in for a shock when the waiter brought out a HUGE plate and buns for the duck. There was no dinner for us that night! The 1/2 duck was a large portion definitely meant for 2 or more. If only I had taken a picture to show just how big it was! It came with hot buttery buns that you were meant to put pieces of duck and yogurt in. The duck itself was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. It practically melts in your mouth. The outside is so crispy, it likely traps all the juice inside. Whether you eat the duck on its own or in the bun, I guarantee that you will never want to stop eating it. "
,,,,,"The fried manchego was also worth getting, especially as a cheaper and smaller item. The outside was very crispy while the inside was a melted and gooey cheese. It is placed on top of a jam that adds a hint of sweetness to the salty and savory cheese. "
,,,,,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. If it weren't for the prices, I would come back as often as I could! There is a reason this restaurant is so highly rated so make sure you stop here when you are in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Having been multiple times, the food is consistently decadent and the service is always great. I've gotten the pork shoulder (extremely tender and well flavoured) and bone marrow (I think about this dish once every other day) each time I've gone to Purple Pig, as well as tried other different dishes with their wine pairings. Only complaint was that the last time I went, their entrance was locked and no one was there to quickly open it - which made trying to get in awkward and confusing."
,,,,,"A consistent Bib Gourmand recipient, the Purple Pig recently moved into a new bigger space and hasn't missed a beat, delivering the same amazing food and service in a great new space!"
,,,,,"The restaurant offers an extensive list of tapas style small plates that are great for sharing. Paired with a huge wine list and a selection of classic and unique cocktails, you can't go wrong with a visit here."
,,,,,"On the Mag Mile, some consider The Purple Pig a ""tourist trap"", I think of it as a ""tourist hot spot"". Unfortunately, as a result of how busy they are, they don't take reservations, so expect to wait for a table. I got to the restaurant at around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and was lucky enough to get the last two seats at the bar, but from when I was there till when I left at 8:30pm, there were people waiting for both floor tables and bar seats."
,,,,,Most definitely worth a visit!
,,,,,Food average and service below average. 
,,,,,I went for my birthday Andy friends apparently ordered some shots for me which never came...
,,,,,Pricey Plate Plight at The Purple Pig
,,,,,"The Salt Roasted Beets are raveable, as is the Mushroom Agnolotti, however, I would've appreciated a large bowlful of these and therein lies the plight. The menu says ""tapas"" portions, the price says ""entree"". I wish I didn't have to feel that asking for bread was an inconvenience and recommend that the music be more reflective of a Mediterranean atmosphere being a Mediterranean restaurant. There was a 30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. Overall the food was extremely flavorful, I just wish there was more of it for the price. After sharing a plate of the beets, mushroom agnolotti and morcilla sausage, for two people and $100 later, we still left hungry."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"My FAVORITE restaurant in all of Chicago hands down! The menu changes often but always features delicious, unique flavors. All the ingredients are so fresh and crafted together so perfectly. If on the menu- the broccoli, hot dog, and duck have been some of my all time favorites! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though. For the quality of food, it's very reasonably priced and worth every penny."
,,,,,"Purple Pig, I finally tried you and you did not disappoint! The key is to come during off hours... say, 3pm on a Friday, when you only have to compete with the tourists for a table, not with your fellow Chicagoans who're still at work. They don't take resos, but there were plenty of seats."
,,,,,"Highlight for us was the Potato Ice cream which are potato chips topped with savory flavors (caviar, salmon roe), with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream. The harmony of the sweet & salty will surprise and delight you! The sardine dish was okay ... not the juiciest or freshest, but then again we're in Chicago not Lisbon. "
,,,,,Their menu is ever-changing and every dish is beautifully plated. I'll definitely be back!
,,,,,This was walking distance from our hotel so we decided to try it out since we were in the mood for pork. At first when we went in we were afraid we wouldn't get a table since it was so full and they told us at least a 2 hour wait but thankfully we were able to seat by the chefs corner. It was nice to see the magic of the food being made by the staff as they signaled and announced the orders in such a cool flow. The tuna tartar was the best i have ever tried in my life and I loved how it looked on its homemade circular chip. I had a pork belly which was delicious and so juicy full of flavors. My friend had the ribs and the fact that it came so easily right off the rib with the tenderness had me obsessed. I normally always have room for dessert so we decided to try the cheesecake with guava sorbet and the combination was perfect! I haven't had such a nice tart sorbet like this but we ate it all up. My group enjoyed every plate they ordered! I wish we could have gone a second time before leaving but this is definitely a must eat if you're ever in Chicago!
,,,,,"The Purple Pig is absolute tapas heaven. Their dishes are sophisticated and exciting. What I love about the menu is that every single item comes with a wine pairing suggestion. With a line out the door at 11:30 AM, you know this is the place to be. "
,,,,,"We ordered a few dishes between the 3 of us and it was plenty. When the food arrived, the server suggested the best way to eat it which I thought was a nice touch. We had:"
,,,,,"Heirloom Tomato Fritters with Squash Blossom, Saffron + Egg Yolk"
,,,,,"Crispy Pig's Ear with Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers + Fried Egg"
,,,,,Eggplant Caponata with Grilled Bread + Goat Cheese
,,,,,"English Muffin + Truffle Sausage Membrillo, Foie Gras Butter + Fried Egg "
,,,,,"Roasted Bone Marrow Herbs, Capers, Onions + Maldon Sea Salt"
,,,,,Pork Kabob Skewers with Bacon Wrapped Figs
,,,,,Duck Proscuitto
,,,,,"Brown Sugar Cheesecake with Lavender Caramel, Blueberry Sauce and Lemon Gel"
,,,,,My two favorite dishes were the Crispy Pig's ear and the English Muffin with truffle sausage. The flavors were perfect and each bite left me wanting more. 
,,,,,I can't wait to return to the Purple Pig and try a whole new round of incredible Mediterranean inspired tapas.
,,,,,"Fantastic, delicious food, and our waitress, Angela, was charming, knowledgeable and professional. Our second time visiting Chicago from Montana, and our second time here. We'll be back!"
,,,,,"Our company had a small corporate party (just around 8 people) and we've decided to check out the Purple pig. And it was absolutely awesome decision as the food is very delicious, pork was crispy and tasty. They also have a good  wine menu. Everyone got satisfied of that evening."
,,,,,"And what is also important, the staff wear masks"
,,,,,"What an awesome lunch in a very safe environment. The tuna tartare was amazing. Just the right balance of nut, fish and citrus. The Squid Ink Tagliatelle had an amazing sauce and PLENTY of seafood perfectly cooked. Service was attentive and kind. You have to try the pig"
,,,,,"First time being here at Purple Pig and it was quite the impression, they have a wonderful atmosphere, their place is so huge, clean, nice and bright. From outside to inside is so nice, well-decorated, organized, and it has aesthetic vibes. Their customer service was so amazing, they have so great and caring staff, they will greet you once you enter their restaurant, and even guide and escort you to the vacant spot. Everything there was so perfect. You have to try their pork belly, it is so soft, and it can literally melt in your mouth. Plus, they are creative regarding to how they plate and serve the food, all the food they have on the menu is extremely delicious. I would eat again at this restaurant whenever I go back and visit Chicago. Will definitely continue to explore their menu. Thank you Purple Pig for such an amazing experience. You are the best! Thumbs up!"
,,,,,"Came from California to visit Chicago and almost everyone recommended to try the purple pig so naturally we made a reservation a couple weeks in advance. 1 week before our reservation the restaurant contacted us and said they they decided to close on July 4th and our reservation was cancelled. Naturally we were upset and there were no other reservations available on any of the other days we were here so we called to see if they could squeeze us in and we were so thankful that they were able to offer an alternate time because this is really a must try restaurant. We got the Burrata and the orecchiette which were both amazing. Neither were too heavily seasoned and the combination of flavors was delicious. We were already so thankful that they fit us in but to top it off, they served us their cheesecake on the house to make up for the cancellation! Service is top notch and we were surprised they even remembered! Will definitely be recommending this restaurant to everyone who comes to Chicago."
,,,,,I was super excited to visit this restaurant after seeing all of the great reviews. 
,,,,,I got the whipped feta cheese appetizer.  It tasted sour.  
,,,,,The service was great so I didn't give it just one star. 
,,,,,"Perhaps, I needed to explore more items on the menu."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Loved my meal here! The dining was very clean and followed social distancing guidelines.
,,,,,We ordered various dishes to taste and share. The chocolate cheesecake was good with the crumbles and blueberries as a topping!
,,,,,"The spanish octopus was so tender and well seasoned, along with the vegetables that came with it. The ricotta gnocchi was also really yummy! The best, my personal favorite, was the half duck. The duck was so crispy on the outside yet moist and tender on the inside. There was a sweet glaze to it that was so well-paired with the greek yogurt on the plate."
,,,,,Definitely want to come back for the half duck!!
,,,,,Great selection of pork parts. 
,,,,,Crispy Pig ear was phenomenal. You won't regret!
,,,,,Wine pairing would be a good choice for dinner as well.
,,,,,"I was really excited to come try the Purple Pig after all the rave reviews I've read about it. Plus, look at all those accolades - Michelin Bib Gourmand, James Beard Rising Star Chef, etc. "
,,,,,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I feel like Purple Pig just fell a bit flat. "
,,,,,"While the food was good, there were plenty of dishes that I felt were just whatever. "
,,,,,"-Crispy Pig Ear: There was no pig ear taste to this at all. It honestly just tasted like fried little chips. Is that why people rave about it? Honestly, the best part of this dish ended up being the KALE. That's not something I'd ever expect to admit in my life...but there it is. "
,,,,,"-Pork Belly: This was a good dish, the sauces were good, and everything tasted great in a single bite together. "
,,,,,"-Octopus: This was just normal? I don't know, do people not eat octopus or something? It tasted like most Octopus dishes I've had. "
,,,,,"I think we had a few other dishes, but honestly, those weren't even memorable. For our first meal in Chicago, it was pretty disappointing. Also, the restaurant is a bit hard to find. It's located within an office building, so it's easy to miss and walk past. "
,,,,,Make sure you bring your wallet - the $$ builds up fast.
,,,,,They told us they were offering Mediterranean food so some of their menu tasted unfamiliar to us maybe to much olive Oil fravoured but not bad overall.
,,,,,Their portion was not generous so we felt a bit pricey.
,,,,,"First things first, this place stays open late! This was a saving grace after a travel hiccup had me stranded in Chicago. "
,,,,,"Chicago hardly fails when it comes to good food. This is a nice upscale restaurant, friendly front desk staff and server. The ladies seated beside me were having the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes and Tzatziki and raved about it so I ordered it. My only critique is that the top was over salted, tapped the skewer on the plate a few times and it was ok. "
,,,,,"Also got the Pork Belly + Tenderloin with Ginger Glaze, Carrot, Radish, Watercress because who doesn't like pork belly, unless you just don't like pork. I just wanted to taste it and packed it up. It reheated well. "
,,,,,They also have a pretty great wine selection and the menu pairs every dish with a wine. Enjoyed it.
,,,,,Amazing secret spot! All about the pigs
,,,,,Must try the 3 ways mushrooms and the pig ears
,,,,,Heriberto was a great server
,,,,,Really great wines variety
,,,,,"I have an excellent experience here at Purple Pig! Their staff is so attentive, helpful, and decent. They served my orders so right and the food plating is so creative. All of their dishes here are so delicious and phenomenal, their portion is so good, and all of the food is worth the price. Their pricing is so fair and reasonable. You can literally order and try everything on the menu without breaking your limits and your pockets. This place is so easy to find and to go to. They are located in Michigan and they are so near to other well-known places around the area. Their place is so huge, so clean, and nice. Very welcoming and relaxing place. Perfect to treat yourself and even bonding with friends and family. Purple Pig is exceptional! Thank you for giving us such an amazing and unforgettable experience and also for showing us how great and outstanding your customer service is. Thank you Purple Pig! Will definitely visit again soon! Also will recommend your place to all the people I know. Thank you! Please keep up the good work! Kudos to all of you!"
,,,,,"This place was absolutely amazing!!! Delicious in so many ways. The only thing that threw the experience off was our waiter Troy.. we asked to have him bring the boxes with our food and he rudely replied ""well this isn't a fast food joint) and stomped away like it was the end of the world."
,,,,,The food is very salty for every single dish I ordered.  Disappointed with the 7k review with 4 starts
,,,,,The menu is super eclectic and delicious! Ambience is also beautiful highly recommend checking it out
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"I just stopped by for a quick lunch in their new location just across from the old spot. Service (Hediberto) was great, friendly, efficient and quick. I ordered a corn salad with walnuts and fresh heirloom tomatoes . It was a Perfect lunch: healthy and tasty. I'd come back for sure when i can chow on a great meat dish"
,,,,,"Got several things here and would say it was all pretty decent. The roasted bone marrow, the pork shoulder were all definitely pretty good."
,,,,,This is definitely a very be-lated post and long overdue. I went last fall with my boss and almost forgot I had this review stored. 
,,,,,"Even on a rainy day this place is bustling and busy as ever! My boss took me here since it was my first time in the city. The restaurant is located at the side of the building  in Downtown with both interior and outside seating. If you're looking to sit inside, you might have to get used to being packed at the same table with other parties. "
,,,,,We ordered a few dishes:
,,,,,1. Milk braised pork shoulder
,,,,,This was the most tender I've ever had for a pork shoulder. The meat was tender enough to just use a simple spoon to split the meat apart. Definitely a must-try!
,,,,,2. Broccoli 
,,,,,"This dish although good, had a little too much vinaigrette for my taste. "
,,,,,3. Spanish Octopus
,,,,,A little salty for my taste but the octopus was tender to a point where I didn't even think it could have been. Full of flavor and one of my favorites at this place.
,,,,,Beware: MAY BE VERY SALTY 
,,,,,Ordered the:
,,,,,- Bone Marrow (most OK dish)
,,,,,"- Truffle Oil Ravioli (TINY square portion, also salty)"
,,,,,"- Scallop Seafood Pasta (EXTREMELY SALTY, had to ask the kitchen to remake, & the 2nd try was still very salty...do not recommend)"
,,,,,- Pork Shoulder 
,,,,,We went on my brother's birthday...but regretted it because the food was not up to par :(
,,,,,They gave us a chocolate cake ... but charged us for it on the bill. So disclaimer: nothing is free for a birthday/poor experience.
,,,,,"We had gotten the purple pig recommended to my fiancé and I and he got a $200 gift card from work to this restaurant, so we were really excited for a nice dinner. We couldn't have been more disappointed with the flavors and quality for the price. We started with the crispy pig ear and fried mozzarella. The pig ear dish was bland and just tasted like the fried skin on a chicken wing with cut up banana peppers and crispy kale with entirely too much oil. The fried egg on top was fine but kind of an odd addition. The fried mozzarella was fine but the portion was extremely small and nothing special. I also ordered the cauliflower which was okay but there was just so much oil that it took away from the flavor. Texture was good but too salty and oily. We ordered the ole yeller cocktail and the paper planes cocktail which were actually pretty good. We then ordered the Sangiovese red wine and piquette sparkling wine. Both were absolutely awful and tasted like the wine had been watered down. We did not finish them and told our waiter that we didn't like them and would prefer a different drink. We were still charged for the wine even though we didn't drink it and didn't like it at all. Finally, we ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. It was fine, meat was cooked alright but flavor was flat and gravy was bland. Tasted like something you might get at Cracker Barrel. Thank goodness we had a $200 gift card because the meal was exactly that much including tip and we would have been even more disappointed if we had paid for this meal. Our server was nice but even some of the most casual places we have been will not make us pay for a drink we don't like. We were so underwhelmed by the quality and the flavor we will absolutely not be returning. Cannot believe this was a $200 meal. There are so many other delicious restaurants in Chicago to try, save yourself the time and money!"
,,,,,"Only came here for happy hour, but had a good experience.  My friends and I sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.  It was quiet when we arrived, but filled up after work (this was pre-COVID precautions).  Their happy hours specials were a good deal, and also tasted good.  The food menu looked good, so I would love to go back at some time to try a good meal (or at least happy hour with some appetizers)."
,,,,,One of my favorite places to grab a meal in Chicago! We went during lunch on a random Wednesday and we were surprised to learn that it was quite busy. Luckily a table opened up so we didn't wait for it too long. 
,,,,,So a few things to know: 
,,,,,"1. Tapas/shared plates -  A lot of the plates were quite large and between the two of us, we ordered three dishes and found out we were quite full. We realized that 2 dishes would have been more than enough but it gave us an opportunity to try more dishes. "
,,,,,2. Get ready for some serious creativity! 
,,,,,"We are blown away by all the dishes and all the flavors that typically wouldn't go together but definitely work in the best way. We ordered the house made hot dog with foie gras butter, passion fruit mustard, and black truffle, the hamachi collar with yellow tomato bbq ,romesco, and sweet pepper salpicon, and burrata cannoli with peaches, Olive Carmel and heirloom tomatoes. Every single dish was absolutely delicious and unique in its own right. The hot dog meat was really satisfying with quality meat paired with some serious flavors. The hamachi collar was served in fried form but it was still very light as an overall dish. The burrata cannoli was a nice balance of whipped burrata balanced by the peaches and tomatoes. "
,,,,,"3.  If you're going for dinner - make a reservation. Even though we went for lunch and there was hardly a wait, I've heard that it can fill up for dinner so if you know in advance, a reservation never hurts."
,,,,,The pork belly and tenderloin was definitely the best out of all the items I chose. It is in a orange citrus glaze sauce to that compliments the salty pork belly and savory tenderloin. 
,,,,,"The turkey leg was flavorful, but very rich for such a large portion. The crispy lentils, which cover the leg were a nice touch. "
,,,,,"The rabbit and dumplings were good as well, but nothing to rave about. There was not much rabbit at all in the dish. "
,,,,,The Sicilian iris was fantastic and a great way to end the meal. 
,,,,,Many different beer and wine options available. 
,,,,,The atmosphere is very modern with many high bar tops. 
,,,,,Service is always great as well.
,,,,,This place is out of this world. It has to be my new favorite restaurant. I've been told by many it is a must try and I am disappointed it took me this long.
,,,,,I ordered from the bar and the service was great. The pork belly and steak came out within about 15 minutes from me placing the order and it was cooked to perfection. The steak had the thinnest crisp on the outside and such a tender middle. The pork belly was tender and flavorful. The sauce was very interesting. Almost like an Asian zing/orange sauce. 
,,,,,"Lastly, for dessert, the Sicilian iris was a brioche bread filled with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips, topped with powdered sugar. It was delicious and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the meal."
,,,,,When there during lunch break with colleagues and got seated right away without reservation. The music was a bit loud so we kinda had to shout at each other so wouldn't recommend for business meetings.
,,,,,"They offered various categories of food including seafood, meet and vegetables, tapas style. The presentation of the dishes were nice and I enjoyed everything we ordered. However, all of the vegetarian dishes we ordered were desserty and too sweet for my taste. More focus on the flavors of the veggies themselves were definitely preferred or maybe recategorizing some of them as desserts?"
,,,,,"This was my second visit to the Purple Pig and it was even better than I remember.  I was here with my brother and sister-in-law for lunch on a Saturday.  It was packed, so we ate at the bar (where the seats are comfortable, but tight).  "
,,,,,They have a great wine list and I love the fact that have a wide variety of wines available in half-bottle size--I picked a great Cab Franc from France.
,,,,,"The food is meant to be shared.  You cannot go wrong with the cheese plate.  We decided on three cheeses and then added the prosciutto di parma.  This was incredible.  All the cheeses were excellent and then the dips that came with them were really good (particularly the fig jam).  They do a great job describing the cheeses to help you make a selection, but imagine all them are excellent.  The prosciutto was really great also."
,,,,,"Next they brought out the broccoli.  This was grilled and covered with an interesting anchovy vinaigrette and then covered with breadcrumbs.  It was original and tasty. We also ordered the orecchiette.  The pasta was really fresh and the rapini was really good.  The sausage was also good, if a bit on the spicy side."
,,,,,"Next was the chicken thigh kebabs.  They were really good, grilled and seasoned just right.  The potatoes that came with them were very good also.  "
,,,,,"For dessert, we had absinthe fritters that came with sheep's milk ice cream.  They were both unique, but good.  Overall a really excellent meal."

,,,,,"The Purple Pig ranks among the most popular and most reviewed restaurants in Chicago. Its food, drinks, and service ranks somewhere between OMG and Lard Tunderin' Jaysus! "

,,,,,"The Pork Belly may have been the softest meat to ever enter my mouth. Of course, I swallowed. Meanwhile the Tenderloin was soft and supple the way pork should be ... Loin, the other soft meat"
,,,,, ** Roasted Bone Marrow ($23 - 5 stars)
,,,,,aka the Richie Rich of spreadable meats ... was so rich and dreamy ... it might actually be served with a $100 bill 
,,,,, ** Pork Jowl ($18 - 5 stars)
,,,,,"A huge Duck Egg over easy is beautifully delicious, but don't let it distract you from the tender, oh, so tender pork cheeks"
,,,,,"By the end of the night, I was a stuffed little piglet ... Oink, Oink ... but, it's ok to Purple Pig out every once in a while because there are just 3 questions relevant to this popular Chicago legend."
,,,,,1. As good as advertised? 
,,,,,Yes!
,,,,,2. Worth the wait? 
,,,,,"Hell, yes!!"
,,,,,3. What to order?
,,,,,All of it. Order it all!
,,,,,"The purple pig was such a fun place to go for a date night! The tapas style food was perfect. We ordered 4 dishes for the 2 of us. 2-3 definitely could've been enough, depending what you order. A few of them were surprisingly very big and filling. First, we each ordered a glass of wine & got the whipped chickpea hummus spread with focaccia bread. It was amazing & had little roasted chickpeas mixed into it. Then we had the ahi tuna & avocado dish which was phenomenal. The third one was the ravioleta, which was also very good but super rich so wasn't my favorite. The last one we got was the slow braised pork shoulder which I'd highly recommend. Such a fun restaurant to go to! Definitely not an every week type of place but a very fun occasion. Our waiter was very nice, but we were at a little 2 person table and we were extremely close to the table next to us. We could hear their conversations & they could hear ours. Didn't bother us much, but something to note."
,,,,,"Excellent! Pork belly, chicken kebabs, broccoli, beets and panna cotta for dessert - everything was amazing! No complaints here."
,,,,,Anytime we're in the city we make it a point to stop at The Purple Pig.  The JLT is to die for.  Everything is so good and we love the atmosphere - very cozy.  Always great service and food.
,,,,,"The Purple Pig has been on my list for a LONG time. But every time I come to Chicago I automatically default to one of three things: (1) deep dish pizza, (2) burgers, or (3) hot dogs/Italian beef. Well, sometimes you gotta take the time to change it up and hit a spot that has been on your list for a LONG time."
,,,,,"Honestly, I must have been fortuitously lucky. Came here on a Thursday night around 7 pm and was worried about how The Purple Pig has no reservations. Nevertheless, I think I got the last open table available so I literally did not wait at all."
,,,,,"So Yelp lists The Purple Pig as a tapas place. Not sure how accurate that is given the size of some of the food on offer. With that said, I get the idea...every plate is intended to be shared. Ordered four items, which I'll list in order below:"
,,,,,"1. Scallops: A good way to start off our night. Great sear on the scallops, which had added flavor with the apple cider nage."
,,,,,2. Roasted Bone Marrow: This is easily the biggest piece of bone I've ever had for a bone marrow! Came with salt for added flavor.
,,,,,"3. Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder: Even though this was one of the most popular dishes according to Yelp, my friend was hesitant on this originally until our waiter said he recommended it as well. Ended up being possibly the best dish we had all night! The pork was extremely tender and the ginger glaze added extra zest. Definitely sold on this one."
,,,,,"4. Half Duck: Every time I see duck on a menu, I have to get it. And this duck did not disappoint. Roasted REALLY well with tons of meat. The Greek yogurt was alright, but the sweet and sour sauce on the other side more than made up for it."
,,,,,Service here was great. Our server was more than helpful with his recommendations and we had a great time here.
,,,,,Finally glad to have made it to The Purple Pig! Definitely a great place to go to if I want to have a nicer dinner in Chicago.
,,,,,"Wow, this place totally surpassed my expectations, even after I peeked at the menu before we actually got here. We ordered the burrata cannoli, crispy pig ears, milk braised pork shoulder, and lamb ribs. After tax/tip it came out to about $100."
,,,,,"The burrata cannoli was interesting to me because I've only ever had sweet cannolis. The burrata was really light and creamy and the sauce dollops and sprouts and seeds added a wonderful nutty, tart, sweetness to the creamy burrata and crispy fried shell. Great contrast of flavors but I thought it was a little pricey since you only get 2."
,,,,,"Crispy pig ears was good as well. This platter was HUGE. I mean like you could easily share this with 3-4 people and be full considering it's a bunch of fried pig ears. There's also kale and pepperoncini as well as a fried egg on top. Honestly the fried egg didn't really add anything for me, but boy the crispy, lightly porky ears + the sour crunchy pepperoncini was AWESOME. And the kale gave it a bit of fragrant veggie crunch which was really good as well. Definitely would recommend."
,,,,,Milk braised pork shoulder was great too. The contrast of the savory tender pork and potato with the vegetables was great. I thought this dish was really well balanced overall although some parts of the pork were a bit dry. Also this is a really big portion so definitely share!
,,,,,"Lamb ribs were also tasty and a good portion size as well. Not a huge fan of the barbecue sauce as I thought it was too sweet, and then adding the creamy lime sauce was just a little strange to me. However the tomatoes on this thing were soooo scrumptious and the meat was fall off the bone tender. Despite the sauce I still really enjoyed this dish"
,,,,,Overall this place exceeded my already high expectations. There's honestly no point spending $250+ on a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant when you can get really delicious flavors and ingredients at a fraction of the price.
,,,,,Treat yo'self and come here at least once!
,,,,,Tip: go early or at a weird hour because the line gets long fast. Kind of a weird location but at least you get to wait indoors if the weather's bad.
,,,,,"The milk braised pork shoulder was AMAZING!! The meat was so juicy, tender and full of flavor. It was an explosion of joy to your tastebuds. The gravy and mashed potatoes were so delicious and creamy as well. Please order this, you won't regret it it!"
,,,,,"Overall, the service was great even though the restaurant was packed. We were lucky to find seats at the bar otherwise we wouldn't have been able to wait to be seated. Despite being a tight schedule, the staff were pleasant and accommodating to our needs. The food and drinks were served quickly and we even ordered a pork shoulder to go, because it was so good."
,,,,,"We also tried the pigs ear, octopus and broccoli. The pigs ear was my second favorite. The strips were crispy tasty little treats that complemented the sunny side egg well. The octopus was tossed in a great seasoning that tasted delightful. The only let down was the broccoli. It tasted as if it was fried in old oil, the flavor was off and the quality of the dish was not comparable to the others."
,,,,,"Overall, please visit and order the pork shoulder! It's a must. This restaurant is a solid 4.5!"
,,,,,"The purple pig, this place is definitely one of the best to go to whenever you want a chill day, maybe with some friends or even just by yourself. but for my own personal experience, i recommend going in here with your friends just to have and feel the entire hype of the place! The place itself is already a neat view and very pleasing to the eyes, the staff would greet you once you go in with bright smiles and for a person like me, it definitely brightens the mood even more if I'm the one to talk! They would guide you to your chosen seat with you circles and proceed to give you the menu, and discussing it. There are very professional to their works yet also very friendly, very casual and simple. And their menu is highlighted with such delicious and neat foods and drinks, foods like fingerling potatoes, their fresh and well cooked meat and many more, also some drinks to go with! I definitely recommend this place a lot, especially the vibe of it. For a next time hang out, this is surely our pick again. Keep up the great work!"
,,,,,"This was actually my second time at the Purple Pig. Maybe it's because the memory of my first time (about 5 years ago) was so good that my expectations were high, but I cannot say that I enjoyed my time nor that I will ever go back."
,,,,,"I went on a Friday evening, and waited about 2 hours, which was to be expected. Their new location does have an area indoor where you can wait, but there is VERY limited seating area, and the security in the area does not allow you to even lean on their wall or crouch down on the floor. It was therefore a very tiring 2 hours. "
,,,,,"When we finally sat down, I was very excited because I remembered how good the food was when I last visited 5~ years ago. The ambiance was busy but not toooo noisy. The seats were pretty close together, but not overwhelmingly so. Food all came out pretty quickly, and the service was great, though the explanation of different foods were hurried and apathetic. The wine also came out only after several dishes were served, which was disappointing because I thought the whole point was the pair the food with wine. "
,,,,,"Spanish Octopus: 3.5/5 the octopus was quite delicious and soft, but the overall dish was too salty. There was a lot more potatoes than octopus. "
,,,,,"Roasted bone marrow: 4/5 I remember really loving this dish when I had it 5 years ago, so I was eager to recommend it to my guest and try it. It was indeed quite delicious but the ratio of bread to bone marrow did not quite match, and it was lukewarm in temperature. it was definitely still good, but not worth the cost or hype. Maybe it's only good the first time you try it?"
,,,,,"Cured meat house platter: 1/5 oh gosh please don't anyone else waste their money on this dish. This was $50 but most of it made me wince as I ate it. Sure there was a variety of different types of meat, but 1) the server was not able to even name all the meats and only pointed out a few and said ""and those are the only ones I know"". What is the point of getting a platter if even the server does not know what they are feeding us? Most of the meats were very, very, very salty and a couple tasted downright terrible. I was very glad that we had other dishes to wash this down with. "
,,,,,"tongue dish?: 4/5 I forget whether it was pork tongue or beef tongue but it was served with a salad that I thought would be more delicate but in reality tasted just like Hawaiian style mac salad. it was good, but not worth the cost. "
,,,,,"gnocchi pasta: we ordered this dish but the server came out and said that the Chef was not happy with the way the dish was coming out that night, so it wasn't going to be served. It was disappointing, yet the restaurant wasn't very apologetic. "
,,,,,"Also, perhaps because they are very busy, the servers kept on trying to take away plates that weren't empty yet. For the amount that we pay, I feel that we should be able to take our time to eat instead of being rushed. "
,,,,,"Overall, none of the items we ordered left us feeling satisfied. At around $200 for 3 people (for 4 items plus wine), I feel like we should have been awed, not underwhelmed."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Went for lunch.  Service and food were great.  Food came out quick.  The meals are shared so we got to try many dishes.
,,,,,"My husband and I decided to go to the Purple Pig for lunch on a Saturday afternoon in Chicago. When we arrived, the wait was around 30 minutes so we decided to grab coffee next door as we wait."
,,,,,"Luckily, the Purple Pig does text notifications. We were notified in about 10-15 minutes that our table was ready. It is always nice when the table is ready before you expect it to be. "
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,The Purple Pig is similar to a tapas place where you order several dishes to share among the group. This is easy to do when it is just my husband and myself. We got three dishes to share:
,,,,,The Burrata Cannoli - This is savory cannoli that is stuffed with burrata instead of sweet cream. This was delicious albeit a little difficult to share as the cannoli shell does when you try to cut into it.
,,,,,"Squid Ink Pasta - The pasta came with a tomato sauce that was tasty. The pasta was homemade, which is nice, but the pasta was too thick for our preference. "
,,,,,"Scallops - The scallops were cooked well and were delicious. The accompaniments were okay. This dish came with cranberry beans. and the beans were cooked with bacon. As someone who doesn't eat bacon, this was annoying to find out. Also, bacon is NOT listed in the menu description."
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"Our server was very kind. He seemed very enthusiastic about the food on the menu. When I tried ordering the tuna dish, he knew right away that it may be out of stock. To which, he asked me if I had a back-up dish I would like in place of the tuna if they were indeed out. "
,,,,,Note to the management: please list out the key ingredient in each dish on the menu. I would not anticipate bacon in a seafood dish if it wasn't stated. 
,,,,,TL;DR - Good food with excellent service. Order multiple different plates to share with your party.
,,,,,What is there not to love about purple pig? Amazing choice of dishes - every time I dine there I struggle to decide of what to try. Every time I visit chicago PP is on my list. Their new location is spacious but deep inside I missed their cozy small old place. I loved seating at the bar and watching their masterful chefs creating dishes right in front of you.
,,,,,This is my 3rd time to the purple pig and I have enjoyed it every time.  It's the perfect place to take friends and family that are visiting from out of town because it's right on Michigan ave and has killer good.
,,,,,"They recently moved locations.  They're now across the street from their old location.  I personally liked the old spot better because of the outdoor seating area, but they did a good job with the inside of the new spot as well."
,,,,,"As for the most important part, the food, I always get the grilled octopus and beets.  The grilled octopus is cooked perfectly with a tangy pesto type sauce.  It's accompanied with roasted potatoes and green beans.  It's awesome.  The beets are accompanied with a whipped cheese and pistachios butter.  The pistachio butter is so good, I wish it came with more.  We got the half duck and broccoli as well this time.  Both spectacular.  The broccoli is hard to describe, but highly recommended.  It has a nice roast, but is soft due to a sauce.  It says the sauce contains anchovies but I didn't taste that.  The duck is huge.  It's super tender and has a really nice crust.  The yogurt it's served with tastes good, and whole thing is better on the brioche it's served on."
,,,,,"Perfect example of how poor service can ruin an otherwise excellent dining experience. The server was rude from the start. When I requested he walk through the menu and highlight some of the popular dishes, he replied ""Everything is good"". .. followed by a snarky stare. Food was dropped off without explanation or a follow-up to see if we enjoyed. He was annoyed to pour water. .. "
,,,,,"I had to flag him down multiple times to request refills and to send an item back for being too salty. Initially I thought maybe he was just having a bad day until I heard him thoroughly reviewing the menu and specials with a smile to the couple next to us. The food was pretty good overall, but the service ruined it for me."
,,,,,Purple Pig has been on my list of bookmarked restaurants to try for a long time. We came on a Monday for lunch and there was no wait at the time but it seemed like most of the restaurant was pretty full. 
,,,,,Service was great and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. Our waiter recommended that we order 3-4 dishes to share and that was plenty. 
,,,,,"We started off with the burrata canoli (apricots, olive caramel, heirloom tomatoes) which was pretty good. The burrata was lighter than I expected and it worked well with the canoli shell. We also had the milk-braised pork shoulder (mashed potatoes and crispy lentils), pork belly tenderolin (ginger glaze, carrot, espresso) and stuffed squid (black eyed peas, prosciutto bread crumbs, chermoula). The stuffed squid was our favorite out of the dishes that we tried. I thought the pork belly was just okay and preferred the braised pork shoulder. As crazy as it sounds...I loved the mashed potatoes that came with the pork shoulder."
,,,,,Amazing flavor combos and superb service! The grilled octopus and the broccoli were my favorites!
,,,,,Its good to go in a small group and share some of the plates! The food comes out one at a time as it's ready!
,,,,,"What an experience. We were celebrating our anniversary and this place was recommended by a good friend! The food was amazing and the service on point! Pork liver pâté, the pork belly, the bread and meat and cheese plate were all so good! And....how can I forget the strawberry panna cotta! A perfect way to end a great experience"
,,,,,"This restaurant came highly recommended by a lot of friends who have visited Chicago, and I can see why. It's fancy and they do not discriminate on portion size."
,,,,,"We came on a Friday during lunch, since we figured that there would be a long wait for Friday night dinner and they don't take reservations. "
,,,,,"We sat by the bar/kitchen area so we can see the chefs in action and it was impressive! Our waiter recommended 3-4 tapas to be shared between 2 people, but I'm glad we only chose 3 dishes because they are filling. "
,,,,,"We ordered the bone marrow, lamb ribs and half duck. The bone marrow just melts in your mouth and goes perfect with the bread and arugula, but it was a bit salty. The lamb ribs come right off of the bone, but was a tad too sweet, so the yogurt on the side helped to bring down the sweetness. Finally, the half duck is a lot of meat! There were some parts of the duck that were a little too dry, and it isn't like Chinese Peking duck. You need that bread to go with it. "
,,,,,"If I were to come back, I would definitely get that bone marrow again and try some other dishes."
,,,,,"Every time I come here it's a great experience. The pesto octopus is simply amazing, and wine is always spot on"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,The food was absolutely divine. I ordered the roasted salmon with fingerling potatoes with piquillo pepper purée. We also had the whipped chickpeas which were divine and far better than any hummus I've ever had. The focaccia was also fabulous. I can't recommend this place enough. Great ambiance and friendly staff.
,,,,,*GLUTEN FREE REVIEW*
,,,,,"This was a really great find. I have celiac (a serious gluten allergy) and asked if they could clean the cast-iron pan / equipment prior to serving us. They took great care of us! We ordered turkey leg, salmon & cauliflower ""small"" plates and all 3 were AMAZING. My favorite was the salmon, my friends fave was the turkey leg. They even brought non-gf lentils on the side for her.  I did not get sick :) Very accommodating, great service, atmosphere on point and amazing food!"
,,,,,Received some of the best customer service. Unfortunately our food was over cooked and very dry.
,,,,,"A friend suggested this place for our visitors from Denver and our first jaunt into the big city since the pandemic. Service was impeccable and the food was out of this world. It sounded strange to mix odd tastes and textures, but it worked. "
,,,,,"We had the pigs ears (really, must try) the Brussel sprouts, braised ribs, duck, and the most incredible gnocchi I have ever tasted."
,,,,,Heriberto the bartender was amazing. Creative and refreshing cocktails. Try his la porpora!!!He was delightful and knowledgeable.Highly recommended. Food was delicious!!!
,,,,,Amazing. This was my 2nd time here and can't recommend it enough!! Fave is the octopus and pork shoulder. 15/10
,,,,,Divine!!
,,,,,We were so excited to go for the family style goodness that is the way of the Purple Pig. 
,,,,,"With an expansive menu, we were a tad overwhelmed at where to start initially with so many great options to choose between. Our server was able to help us narrow down some great options. As a party of 5 we ordered 5 plates in addition to to a board. We did one item from each section (veg, seafood, etc) but got two under pork (if it's in the name of the restaurant, you know it's the right way to go)."
,,,,,Here's what we got:
,,,,,Mix of meats and cheeses 
,,,,,Milk-braised pork shoulder
,,,,,Salt roasted beets
,,,,,Grilled artichoke
,,,,,Ricotta gnocchi 
,,,,,Scallops 
,,,,,"Everything was phenomenal. I worry I will never eat gnocchi, artichoke hearts or beets that are this good anywhere else or ever again. My only regret was not being in town long enough to come back to try other goodies on the menu."
,,,,,"I will say we came pretty early which got us a table fast, but it does look like it gets busy closer to dinner time, even early in the week. If you have any questions the staff does a fantastic job. "
,,,,,I'm a huge fan!!
,,,,,"I had a great time at The Purple Pig. They recently opened the outdoor so I decided to give it a try. I was lucky to get a reservation spot on Tock. The reservation does require a $20 fee which will be applied to the check, but sometimes they might forget, so you want to check the final bill. The outdoor area was very small- maybe 5-6 tables, but it was fenced off and had its own trailer bathroom. "
,,,,,"We ordered the duck, pork shoulder, pork belly, broccoli and sweet corn. They were all really good."
,,,,,The drinks were good as the portions were generous and there were a lot of alcohol in them- which is a plus!
,,,,,"All the meat dishes were very tender and the vegetable dishes were really nice too. It was one of the best broccoli dishes I have tried! The pork belly was a bit fatty, but it was soft and well cooked. The pork shoulder was meaty and the gravy, mashed potato and meat all went very well together."
,,,,,"The duck was massive, but still very soft and juicy. "
,,,,,Some reviews mentioned that the portions are small but we had more than enough food and walked out very full.
,,,,,"I am not sure if this is worth the hype or the wait in the pre-covid period, but I thought the prices are relatively reasonable for the quality of food and there are many good options. Perhaps not the best in Chicago, but definitely the best in River North around Michigan Ave :)"
,,,,,"Heard about this place a few times before, so I stopped in. At the door my temperature was taken. I was immediately seated. Every party was given a generous amount of space for Dine-In service which made me feel safe. "
,,,,,"Browsing the menu I HAD to order the cheese plate which came with a yummy date jam. (Cheese: Stilton Blue, Robiola..). "
,,,,,"Regrettably, I did not continue my meal after ordering a sangria (that was sadly watered down) and for the fact that the waiter, Heriberto did not seem too fond of me inquiring about the drink selection. Instead of receiving a suggestion he was cold and dismissive. It made me feel uncomfortable/uneasy, so the next time he came to get my order I asked for the check and left. "
,,,,,I probably won't be returning.
,,,,,"OMG, my sister and I went on a Chicago Foodie Trip in 2019.  This restaurant was one of my favorites.  The pork was so delicious.  If you love pork (all of their side dishes are great, too), you must come here."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"We dropped by on a Monday night without reservation and we were seated right away. Staff is super nice and welcoming. It was our first time here and they gave us some recommendations. We picked 2 from the recommendation and 1 of our own. It is tapas style, after our first dish we thought we would be leaving hungry, but by the end of our meal we were satisfied, 3 dishes was the right amount of food for the two of us. Each dish was full of flavor with a unique taste. Definitely a must try. We will be back next time we visit Chicago."
,,,,,MUST eat here  when in Chicago!  Food  is  just  fantastic!  Choose the broccoli as your vegetable - it  is excellent!
,,,,,Innovative Food!  Every plate we had was fantastic.  Broccoli was excellent! Try the deviled eggs- delicious. Pork was wonderful.  A must.
,,,,,"Delicious food and fun cocktails! One of our favorite restaurants. Every time we visit Chicago, this is a must hit on our list. Gotta love their cured meats made in-house. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Really loved this place and would definitely go here again."
,,,,,I decided on a whim to go to this restaurant for late lunch early dinner.  I arrived around 3:30 and was surprisingly more packed then I expected.  They also had a good turnover. 
,,,,,The theme is Mediterranean.  The interior is really nice and the music selection was on point! Shout out to the dj or whoever curated the playlist! 
,,,,,"I ordered the whipped chickpea, mushroom 3 way and the mushroom agnolotti, as well as the butternut squash creme brûlée.  The whipped chickpea (6/10)  is just a fancy way of saying hummus but they added parmesan and rosemary.  It was good, not great, but good.  The mushroom 3 way (9/10) was very good and I really enjoyed it.  The mushroom agnolotti (12/10) was the star though and was one of the best pasta dishes I've had.  The stuffing tasted like a creamy mushroom soup, the agnolotti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect match.  I would definitely recommend it, especially if you like mushrooms.  The dessert (6.5/10) was also good but not what I expected.  When i read creme brûlée, I assumed it would have a sugar coating on the top that has been caramelized.  This was not the case.  The condensed milk gelato was interesting and it kind of tasted like a sweetened labneh - popular in Levant/Middle Eastern cuisine.  I would recommend you to try it if you aren't expecting a brûlée but nonetheless enjoy these flavors."
,,,,,"Overall, the experience was good and the other stuff on the menu looks good and would recommend you give it a try.  The waiters were also friendly and helpful."
,,,,,"The service and food was amazing. Good sized and filling portions, with unique and delicious flavors. The restaurant has a great style, and it's in a fun location. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"The food, the service, the variety of the menu- even their beer selection- five stars!"
,,,,,"I highly suggest this restaurant, it was an amazing experience. Everything from the service to the decoration and the vibe that this restaurant has, was phenomenal."
,,,,,"When we got to the place they took our name and phone number and later on they text me to let me know when the table was ready, it was ready 20 minutes after the time we register and they have told us initially that it will take like 40 minutes."
,,,,, Any wait you have to do for this restaurant is worth it because the experience will be fabulous. 
,,,,,The server was always checking on me because I told him that 
,,,,,I am allergic to shellfish so they made sure with the chef that the food was good for me. 
,,,,,"The pork meat plate that we order was on point, was crispy,  juicy and tasty. The presentation of the plate was simply astonishing as you can see in my pictures. "
,,,,,Later came the pasta that I order with truffle oil and some pork chops. It was so delicious.
,,,,,"Then we order dessert, it looked like regular cheesecake but there was nothing regular about it, the taste was phenomenal melting in my mouth, with lavender on top you could smell and taste the aroma all over. "
,,,,,"This was a wonderful choice for a New Year's Eve dinner, I hope I can go again."
,,,,,"A good place to hit with friends from out of town. They have a very eclectic menu with items and animals you wouldn't be able to find in most states or cities. You should avoid if anyone in your group is a vegetarian, not as many options for them."
,,,,,"Went here with a reservation and had a great time. At first glance, it was a bit confusing because the restaurant is located inside another building, but we managed to find it. Ordered many things to try the menu and my favorite was the Pork Tongue. My dad ordered it on a whim and boy was it worth it!! Definitely will be returning when back in town, especially after learning they are switching to 'reservations needed' after it worked out so well during COVID."
,,,,,Came here with several friends and had a great time! We ordered a bunch of plates and shared everything. Their menu is pretty much set up in a way for you to order and share a variety of their dishes instead of each getting individual entrees. The waiter was extremely helpful in giving us recommendations as well. It's a little on the pricey side but it's definitely worth the experience!
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,This is a good restaurant.  The wait is not bad if you are visiting the city.  The pricing is fair and the service is fast.
,,,,,TL;DR
,,,,,What to order:
,,,,,"- Italian Feast - unfortunately it looks like they've moved onto the ""Greek Feast"" :( - $18 per person + tax + tip"
,,,,,What to watch out for
,,,,,- we specified 5:30 as the pickup time but they messaged us way earlier around 4pm to come pickup the food; when we got the food it was still somewhat warm but I don't understand why they didn't stick to the specified time...
,,,,,=====
,,,,,"Ordered the Italian feast for 2 a couple weeks ago using Tock and it was really good! It comes with chicken cacciatore with potatoes; a salad with goat cheese, beets, and roasted asparagus; and a baked pasta with cheese and pork neckbone gravy. "
,,,,,"The highlights were definitely the chicken in the cacciatore, the asparagus in the salad, and the pasta was really good as a whole! The chicken fell off the bone and was extremely tender, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and everything in general was very flavorful. The portion sizes were fine and we spread out all the food across maybe two-ish meals each. They give you one salad box per person but everything else just comes in one container."
,,,,,"Some lowlights were that in the 2-person portion we got maybe 3 or so pieces of chicken and a lot of potato. The salad's dressing was also quite sweet, but as far as salads go, I mean, it was fine (I don't eat salads for the taste, I'm afraid)."
,,,,,"Overall I would love to try their other takeout options! ~$20 per person for the Purple Pig is a pretty darned good deal compared to their normal prices, and for the quality of food you get. Only docking a star for the pickup time snafu."
,,,,,"I wouldn't waste your time or money at this restaurant. I honestly don't understand how it has this many good reviews. My family ordered 3-4 of the ""most popular dishes"" (lamb shank, Gyro, Duck, Crispy Pig Ear) suggested by the waiter who came to our table once for less than 10 second. Never picked up our bill. Maybe the duck was good. Service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. "
,,,,,Girl n the Goat or RPM are much better choices for anyone in Chicago.
,,,,,"Fantastic experience!! Wish we could have eaten more than we did but were absolutely stuffed. Enjoyed the bone marrow, ahi tuna tartar and the beets! Everything was out of this world. Just wish we had more space to try the pastas and perhaps some dessert :( Service was nice and the ambiance was wonderful. Definitely recommend making a reso outside of peak timings!"
,,,,,The truffle ravioletti is perfection. It's rich and creamy and cheesy with amazing flavor. I had a few more dishes to share and everything was really good. The service could be a little better. Always slow at the start.
,,,,,"2nd time here and once again another great experience, I arrived in midday and it was already packed but still got sat fairly quickly, our order was took almost instantly and the food arrived in courses all in appropriate times, this is a upbeat fast pace restaurant, noise levels are moderate in my opinion, great wine and dine. "
,,,,,I got a variety of dishes that I crave almost everyday now the food and service are all elite level I will absolutely make another visit.
,,,,,"FOOD: Tapas with a heavy emphasis on MEAT. The COVID menu is a bit smaller than what I remembered from my last visit, but they had a great cheese/charcuterie selection (including a prosciutto duck!) and fan favorites pork shoulder and belly. The food is rich and full and the flavors are certainly not what you would expect from typical tapas "
,,,,,SERVICE: Prompt service with great attitudes. No issues here
,,,,,EXPERIENCE: The new location has multiple indoor seating options as well as a patio out back
,,,,,"VALUE: Deceiving large portion sizes. Between two people, we had two appetizers and two entrees and had enough for a full meals worth of left overs. Appetizers are about $10-15 and entrees $20-35"
,,,,,SUMMARY: Amazing meats and intriguing menu. This place is a classic and well worth the wait. Have come back multiple times and will continue to do so in the future
,,,,,"Best meal I've had in Chicago. I've never been to a restaurant with over 7K reviews and felt accomplished snagging a reservation for lunch. As the main suggests, the focus is pork so maybe don't drag your husband there like I did if he doesn't eat pork... but there is still plenty on the menu for those individuals to choose from. We shared a mushroom stuffed pasta topped with truffle and it was scrumptious. I had the pork belly recommended to me by our waitress and it was the best I've ever had. Usually when I order pork belly it's the size of a bird dropping and crunchy. This was perfectly cooked sous vid and complemented by a side salad of carrots and green with a sweet purée. For dessert, we shared a bread pudding and it was excellent. We were able to remove the orange peel from top as we're not fans. I can't wait to return to try more from the menu. Overall very reasonably priced for large portions and great service!"
,,,,,"Very cute place! Great service and ambiance. The portions were a bit smaller than we expected, especially for the charcuterie plate. A bit of a tourist trap and overpriced, but still good food!"
,,,,,I have had many people tell how good this place is so I had to try it. We were lucky enough to get a kitchen table  where the cooks are cooking directly in front of you. Ordered the grilled octopus and ribs. The food was tasty but way too much salt for my liking. I thought it was just me but the people I went with thought the same of the food they ordered.  Ease off the salt and the 3 star would be a 4.

,,,,,"First time I went there was in 2018 during a business trip. Fantastic dining experience there, my foodie Italian colleague was marveled at this restaurant's innovative cooking and handle of variety of meats. Probably the best memory I had with Chicago. Went back again in 2021- after the pandemic, they changed the location to the opposite side of the river and to be honest; either they changed their chef or my taste butt or personal dining habits changed, it was a mediocre experience. If solely based on the first time experience, yes I would give a rating of 10, out of 5. But now? I'm not sure. 4 is the most I could rate for their current performance."
,,,,,"Nice clean restaurant. Staff was attentive & we received wonderful service. Thank you Tr. We ordered the bone marrow, salt roasted beets & the pork shoulder, affogato. Highly recommend the bone marrow, the salt roasted beets & the affogato (dessert)."
,,,,,"Great food! Service was great also. We shared basically everything that we got and were still full by the end of it! Absolutely recommend the whipped feta, it was SO GOOD. Our server was very informed about the menu and great with suggestions."
,,,,,"Hands Down ... it was my best meal in Chicago. I tried to get reservations but a no go. So we popped in after our boat cruise in hope to get a spot. The bar was open and so it began. The beet salad was on point, that pistachio butter underneath was unbelievable. Next up the charcuterie board to continue my lunch journey. My eyes drooled over the Pork Secreto, the dish was so tender and moist. To finish it off,  pork ribs that fell off the bone. I needed to stop eating but I couldn't. Top notch wine list and great service added to the best time here."
,,,,,"We have been meaning to try this restaurant and decided to for an early V-day dinner. We ordered the pigs ears, ricotta ravioli (special), milk braised pork, and half duck. We were expecting to still be hungry given it's considered a tapas/small plate restaurant, but before the duck (last dish) came out, we were actually getting full. Truthfully, maybe it's just us and we're not good critics and don't have a golden tongue, but we thought it was just OK. Atmosphere was nice. Our waiter could be more attentive, felt that we saw the worker who cleared our plates and swapped clean plates more than him. Everything was presented beautifully. The pig ears lacked taste/salt, but the crispy kale and diced Korean daikon radish was a good touch to the grease from the fried pigs ears. Ricotta ravioli was an interesting taste, combination of sweet and savory. Milk braised pork was good, tender and started to fill us up. The duck was wayyyy tooo salty, we only ate 1/4 of it. We ended the night with the pear tart, which was the highlight of our night. Everything was paired perfectly that made us considered if we should've ordered our own. I would return for this dessert."
,,,,,"I rarely mark places as a five star but this place pace deserves the accolades.  Deliciously good!  They took us in at last minute even thought they were full that evening. We ordered the 5 different dishes and they came out almost together, in perfect synchrony. Each wine pairing was remarkably well planned, and we walked out feeling like we had our best meal in Chicago."
,,,,,A friend recommended the Purple Pig. The ginger glazed pork belly is the absolute bomb. It just melt right in your mouth. It's so amazing that I decided to learn how to make this myself.
,,,,,"The smile says it all. Great place for small plates. The ribs were amazing but they mix well with the pasta. So, if two are dining,  one should order the pasta with sausage and the other should order the ribs and share. The taste combo will blow your tastebuds to the moon."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig is a highly recommended place here in Chicago! If you are here in this city and looking for amazing place to eat, relax, and spend quality time. You must visit and give this place a try. Purple Pig is amazing! You will be surprise with their menu, it is so big, nice, and you can see how huge is the selection they have. They will offer you their best sellers and really affordable dishes. You will absolutely love their appetizers and their desserts. Their dishes here are truly delicious. They offer so many great deals like discounts, promos, and others. You can really save a lot here. They are so fair and reasonable in terms of pricing. You can order anything you want, try the food you want to try, and believe me that it will not break your pockets. They are cheaper than other restaurants around. This place is so easy to find, very near to other well-known place, and very accessible. You will absolutely love the whole place and the ambiance of it. Purple Pig is exceptional! Great foods. Good prices. Awesome staff. Amazing service. Good place. Thank you guys for awesome experience! You all did a really great job! More customers to come guys! Thank you for wonderful service! Kudos to all of you! Cheers!"

,,,,,"Ambience/Service: bustling upscale pub vibes, no outdoor seating but super cozy environment and friendly staff! Reservations highly recommended this place fills up!"
,,,,,"Presentation: so artsy and colorful, from the drinks to the food!!!"
,,,,,"Taste: the ravioletto is something to behold, if youre a truffle lover you really get the bang for your buck, the taste is INSANE, especially when mixed in with ricotta. The tuna tartare is quality and a HUGE portion, amazing with the cracker ring and avocado! The corn salad veggie option is SO fresh and crunchy, love the basil in it! The bone marrow pork chop was cooked perfectly and was so buttery and amazing, I was obsessed with the onions it came with! The Greek salad was a solid starter (we preferred it without the olives they added a bitter aftertaste), and their hibiscus spritz was beautiful and tasted refreshing and fun!! ALSO, their wine list is amaaaaazing! We tried the Croatian wine it was chef's kiss!"
,,,,,Price/Quality: $$-$$$ but SO WORTH IT SERIOUSLY. If you havent been this is your sign!
,,,,," Standout factor: come here for amazing food AND wines! This spot has been one of my top 3 restaurants in Chicago for as long as Ive been dining in Chi, a major reason being everything I've ordered has been a delicious and solid choice, nothing disappoints EVER! I find myself wanting to come back again and again to try the entire menu AND re-order the same food, which is very rare for me! The chef adds such a unique twist to his dishes that you just can't find  anywhere else !"
,,,,,"Food & wine pairings here were fantastic. Truffle offerings were unreal. Loved the wine recommendations near each entree. I don't believe in making a restaurant lose their stars on yelp, but it did seem like there was a huge disconnect in this restaurant when it comes to team work. Bartender was slammed and it seems like there was no bar back in sight to help him. My entrees were dropped off without silverware, and when I asked for a fork the expo dead ass told me to ask the bartender who was obviously drowning. I looked at him shocked and then he came back thirty seconds later with a fork lol. Sometimes its easier to just do the thing instead of delegating."
,,,,,"Absolutely amazing.  We went here because of the strong reviews and we were not disappointed. Every menu item was fantastic and unique. King crab, pork belly, ribs, tuna tartar, beets, mushrooms, whipped feta - all were fantastic.  Service was timely and informative. Lively atmosphere but not overwhelming.  The only drawback is the setting walking into what appears to be a business center but once inside you might as well be right on the Mile.  A member of our party said it was the best meal she's ever had!  It is that good."
,,,,,"I came here with my family, and we were uneasy because the inside was hot and humid. Though the food is good, the service is slow, so we stayed for less than two hours."
,,,,,"This was the best place we went to in Chicago! The drinks were unique and amazing, especially the espresso martini. It is family style and every food we got was just as good, if not better than the last. You can't go wrong here which makes it that much better. A must go if you're in the area."
,,,,,"We celebrated our anniversary in Chicago and one of our favorite spots was the Purple Pig. We were sad that it was just the two of us, because we wanted to order one of everything on the menu, but that would turn us into the purple pigs, so we went with a few favorites. The wait was minimal, and gave us a chance to sample some cheese and wine before we dined."
,,,,,"The dishes are rich and full of flavor, but we would have licked the plates if it wasn't rude to do in public-ha!"
,,,,,"Some of our favorites were the Spanish octopus, pork jowl, pork liver pate, salt beets, and scallops. We kept seeing the turkey leg go by, but were so full, we couldn't make it work. Oh well, I guess we have to go back."
,,,,,My husband and I really liked the food at Purple Pig. It's a restaurant that's much better for groups because the portions are huge and you want to be able to try a lot of different things. We ordered a lot just to try. My favorite was the duck and the fried pig ears. All flavors were delicious though. Be sure to make a reservation because this place is packed by 11:30 am.
,,,,,Wow wow wow. This has easily shot to the top of my list as one of the best restaurants in the city. Every bite was absolutely delicious and beyond well done. I can't even pick my favorite bite because everything was delicious although I would say you can't leave here without ordering the crispy pig ear. We enjoyed the Babic wine which was a suggestion as a great pairing on a lot of the dishes we ordered. I thought I was full and then saw the dessert menu had a goat cheese cheesecake and so I made room. I can't wait to come back here to try their meat and cheeses and another wine. A perfect date night spot.
,,,,,"Our go-to place when we're downtown with friends and want to splurge (otherwise, we hit the Goat below)."
,,,,,"They weren't a place to go during the pandemic, because you're crammed in shoulder-to-shoulder, but that's also the fun of it. Feels like the beerhalls of Germany, but with shared plates. "
,,,,,"They discontinued our favorite, the beef tenderloin, but they still have the turkey drumstick, the roasted beets, and the squid ink tagliatelle. "
,,,,,Great place.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Came here for the first time because it's one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, but it's really disappointed me! We ordered three dishes and each of them is way too salty. It's overpriced and not worth the rave reviews. We drink a lot of water after dinner and throat feels so uncomfortable. Not recommend it, I would rather eat Chick Fill A close by."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"We loved the food ambiance and service, make sure to visit this restaurant while you're in Chicago and make your reservation weeks in advance to enjoy delicious food and great cocktails !!"
,,,,,"This flavor experience may have been the best I've ever had. I enjoyed watching Chef Bannos and his team send out plate after plate - a feast for my eyes. Here's a tip: if you go to the host, you may be told the wait is over an hour...don't worry! All seats around the bar are first come, first serve, and a majority of them were open when we arrived at dinner rush on Monday night. Seat yourself and someone will be right there. We picked the few spots in front of the kitchen, where you can watch the magic happen. Everything was timed flawlessly, so that when we finished one dish, the next came right away. Our server was also EXCELLENT at suggesting wine pairings, just ask! This spot is known for delicious food AND fabulous wine. We started with the Grilled Broccoli, creamy and bright, I am confident these were the best greens I've ever had. Next, the Burrata Di Puglia: after figuring out how to cut into it, this was the most interesting dish I tasted, balancing sweet, salty, creamy, acid, loved it. The Ricotta Gnocchi came next, and it melted in my mouth - as did the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder. If I had to recommend anything on the menu, it would be this pork shoulder as our whole group couldn't get enough. We didn't have room for dessert, but we ended our night with the blood sausage: I don't see this on the menu anymore at the time I'm writing this but if it comes back I would absolutely recommend as a starter or an ender!"
,,,,,"I had high expectations for this one, ambience in a hotel/office building lobby is less than desired, the place was packed but the shoes for me was mediocre. We got a variety of everything, the dock was less than desirable trying to pick it apart, everything else was just average and taste and not pleasing on the eye."
,,,,,"Honestly was pretty disappointed with this place. Everyone used to rave about purple pig being a good restaurant but all of the food was very average. All of the food was basic. Whatever you do don't order the octopus. Biggest waste of money, the consistency was gross and no flavor. Tasted like cheap frozen fish. Our server was nice, no issues there. Just really really mediocre food for the $200 we spent"
,,,,,We went to Purple Pig for our wedding anniversary based on a friend's suggestion. We loved it! Service is excellent! Food was as delicious as their cocktails.
,,,,,We are new to Chicago and had heard of this place from our realtor.  We came in for lunch and it was packed. We were lucky to find two seats at the bar. The food is delicious and very nicely plated. Portions are a good size. My favorite was the beets.  The beets came with a pistachio cream that was delicious!. The atmosphere is very lively... busy. Space is limited and just very tight! Not a place to go with large groups. Not a romantic date night type of place either. Expect to sit very close to others...
,,,,,"10/10 on drinks- We got the ol' yeller and the london mule. Of those 2, we liked the ol' yeller more. "
,,,,,"For food, we didn't get too much since we weren't super hungry. Pricing is fair."
,,,,,"Crispy pig ears came with dino kale and banana peppers. It is good to share with more people, but between 2 people, it was bit too oily and salty. Luckily we had the drinks to help cut the fat"
,,,,,Pork Belly- SO GOOD. very flavorful. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It went well with the side salad. Recommend for sure.
,,,,,Amazing food and ambience.
,,,,,"1. Food: The tapas here have huge servings, so I ordered 2 items from the ""Snacks"" list since I came here alone. It's best to come with a big group and share a few dishes to taste what you want!"
,,,,,"- Crispy pig ears with kale (7.5/10): They were good at first, but hard to finish. Towards the end the ears and kale became a bit too salty/greasy, and it started to taste like an overcooked breakfast with the egg."
,,,,,"- Scallops (9/10): The scallops were cooked nicely, abd the sauce that came with it paired well with them."
,,,,,"- Pomegranate and caramel cheesecake (9.5/10): Personally I love all of these flavors and textures, so having them together was like heaven!"
,,,,,2. Ambience 10/10: The vibe is a bit more formal and the servers are very attentive and friendly. As a party of one I sat at the bar and it was easy to get the servers' attention. At the same time they tend to squeeze people onto edge of the bar so I noticed some people didn't have much room to eat.
,,,,,"3. Wait: Anywhere from 1-2 hours. When I came as a party of one I was seated right away, but plan ahead if you're coming as a group. They don't take reservations."
,,,,,Will definitely come again if I ever visit Chicago!
,,,,,"This place was a total black horse for our group of San Francisco Bay Area tourists. The ambiance, service, and food were ABSOLUTELY incredible -- I'm still dreaming about the duck and squid ink tagliatelle. We had made reservations and were seated immediately. Our waiter let us know that most of the plates were intended to be shared and will be served as the kitchen completes them -- so family style! We were able to try a lot of dishes this way!"
,,,,,"- Roasted Bone Marrow Smear: fatty, delicious, and lots of bread! We were surprised at the amount of food this came with! Definitely on the pricier side of smears though, but that makes sense."
,,,,,"- Salt Roasted Beets: Great flavor! Really brings out the sweetness of the beets, and the presentation was AMAZING! I liked the whipped goat cheese, but personally did not think the pistachio butter complimented the beet flavors. The butter by itself was totally yummy though!"
,,,,,"- Squid Ink Tagliatelle: A MUST! I am STILL craving it after traveling back to San Francisco. The visual presentation, the complexity of flavors, the subtle presence of squid -- TALK ABOUT YUM!! Please get this. You won't regret it!"
,,,,,"- Ricotta Gnocchi: Honestly, compared to the tagliatelle, this was just so ... average. BUT it was definitely a good dish -- I just can't recommend this pasta over the tagliatelle. I probably had one bite and then went back to the tagliatelle. Oops."
,,,,,"- Chicken Thigh Kebabs: Very juicy!! I loved the potatoes in this dish, they were out of this world! I would say this is probably one of their more basic meat plates, but our table liked it anyways! Hand held food is always fun :D"
,,,,,"- Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder: SUPER TENDER! Literally fall apart at the prodding of a fork. And the combination with the mashed potatoes and gravy? An elevated Thanksgiving dinner experience -- consider an alternate universe where this was the household meat of choice for the holidays, instead of turkey. Revolutionary. Peak cuisine."
,,,,,"- Half duck: WOW, this was SO good. You get a little bit of the gamey duck taste but it is so mellow and fits so well with the greek yogurt, it's kind of sinful. Makes you almost think you can never eat chicken again because this is the superior poultry. I would highly recommend getting this! Side note: this came with brioche buns but honestly if this came with soft baozi it would truly elevate this dish. However, this is not an Asian restaurant -- I get it. But think about it, will you, Purple Pig?"
,,,,,"Service was also AMAZING and the staff was super on it! Our plates were cleared whenever an empty plate was noticed. Our water glasses were filled whenever one was half full. Loved the attention and prompt decision making skills that made our dining experience here so easy. We were really able to just focus on the quality of the food, the company of the people eating with us, and the wonderful city we were visiting."
,,,,,"Also side note: the person who sat us down was SO lovely to make conversation with. She had complimented my BTS phone background and we talked briefly about ita bags! We even heard dynamite play during our meal, LOVE THAT. Thank you for being such a wonderful start to our Purple Pig dining experience!!"
,,,,,This place is fantastic and I will definitely be back. We had reservations for 5 and were seated promptly. Our server was attentive and had a positive attitude! 
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,- Roasted bone marrow
,,,,,- Crispy pig's ear
,,,,,- Ravioletto
,,,,,- Ricotta gnocchi 
,,,,,- Pork belly
,,,,,- Half duck
,,,,,"Everything was delicious and so so flavorful. I highly recommend the half duck, it was my favorite dish of the evening. I still have dreams to this day of the duck. Perfectly moist and melts in your mouth."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,The place was pretty crowded and our waitress was very helpful in selecting the dishes. We started with the Pumpkin carrot soup which was a special item. It tasted pretty good. Next item that we ordered was the hummus and focaccia. The portion size was pretty large. The focaccia was tasty and was dripping with butter/olive oil. I think it was a bit too much. Then came the fried manchego which was presented beautifully and tasted good. We then ordered the salt-roasted beets which was again a decent portion size. It was topped with pistachios and was served with delicious pistachio butter. 
,,,,,"By the time we came to order pasta, we were pretty full. Hopefully, I try their pastas the next time."
,,,,,"For dessert to-go, the pear tart had a good flavor combination and the roasted white chocolate panna cotta was delicious and creamy."
,,,,,I would recommend this place.  Would be better if they had more vegetarian options.
,,,,,"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This place is known for long wait times and not allowing reservations. Not luckily, but luckily because of COVID, they are currently doing reservations. So we're able to walk in with our reservation and get a table right away. I will admit, this place was very casual and I felt like we were over dressed. They were very professional throughout the night and did really great explaining every dish and giving directions on how to eat the food so you can get the best taste out of each dish. Jimmy Bannos Jr. even stopped by our table to talk a little bit and made sure we were enjoying our night. "
,,,,,"We started off our night with a couple of drinks. My wife ordered their ""Paloma"" and I was feeling rich and magical that night and ordered their ""24 Carrot Magic."" The Paloma was a simple classic made with Espolon blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. It's really hard to get this one wrong. Definitely tasty. The 24 carrot Magic was something different. This one came with corazon reposado tequila, ancho Reyes Chile liqueur, carrot juice, lime juice and ginger syrup. A drink with a kick of heat, thanks to the ancho Reyes Chile liqueur. Never heard of such liqueur and is now on my list of things to buy! The carrot juice was overpower and made the drink taste healthy. I just wish they had the wider selection of drinks, the at least the drinks we both got were fantastic. "
,,,,,We started off with their Crispy Pigs Ear and ended up with a total of four entries plus dessert. 
,,,,,"Crispy Pigs Ear-This seems to be a very popular dish. It's served with salty crispy pigs ear, mixed with kale, and pickled banana peppers and topped with a fried egg. You must break the yolk so it serves as a dressing to the pigs ear and mix it all together. If you just eat the pigs ear by itself, it will be too salty. The egg, kale and banana peppers helps balance all the flavors. Not sure if I'd get this again though. "
,,,,,"Chicken thigh kebabs-You get two perfectly seasoned chicken kebabs on top of four fried smashed potatoes with Tzatziki sauce at the bottom. The chicken was very tender and went perfectly with their tasty tzatziki sauce. The potatoes we're good and worked as a starchy filler. The dish was tasty but $20 for two chicken kebabs was a tad bit much. Wouldn't mind ordering again, but would probably try some other plates next time. "
,,,,,Whipped Feta- This dish was tasty. It came with toast and plenty of whipped feta to spread on the toast. The whipped feta came with cucumber and marinated tomatoes. The tomatoes were very tasty and tasted sweet. I would definitely order this dish again. 
,,,,,"Roasted Bone Marrow- This dish was my favorite dish of the night. It came with herbs, capers and onions with a side of Maldonado sea salt. You spread the bone marrow on the toast, grab some of the salt and sprinkle it on top, and then you top it off with the greens. A perfect bite every time. I would order this dish again and again. "
,,,,,"For dessert we opted for their popular ""Sicilian Iris."" I will admit by dessert time, we were already stuffed, and whenever we're completely full we skip dessert. But since it was our anniversary and since it's the Purple Pig, we had to try a little bit of everything. The Sicilian iris, was tasty. It came warm and the fried ball was huge. It came stuffed ricotta, and chocolate chip. It reminded me of a warm gooey ball version of a cannoli. I wouldn't mind ordering this again. "
,,,,,"Overall, The Purple Pig hype is real. Everything was phenomenal. Flaw customer service, delicious food. Will definitely be returning."
,,,,,"This place was hyped up immensely to me and while it didn't completely miss the mark, it did not reach my lofty expectations."
,,,,,"The portions are tiny, so don't come here too hungry. All the plates are meant to be shared amongst the table, just to get a little taste of multiple plates."
,,,,,"The one thing that was out of this world great was the whipped feta appetizer. That had incredible flavor, however the dipping bread to whipped feta ratio was way off, not anywhere near enough bread. They did bring us more bread upon asking and later charged us $1 for it which is a little silly. "
,,,,,"The pork blade steak I would highly recommend as well, high quality tender meat. The same cannot be said for the braised pork shoulder, it was dry and lacking flavor."
,,,,,"The service was a little dry and didn't seem to be up to the standard of comparable restaurants. Overall it definitely has its bright spots, but it isn't worth the hype in my opinion."
,,,,,"Okay when I die, please bury me in the whipped chickpea focaccia- please and thank you. Also the mushroom agnolotti was perfection- I will say the presentation of the dish didn't get me too excited until I tasted its goodness and I took all of my judgments back. My husband is obsessed with the smashed crispy potatoes- he has dreams about them."
,,,,,"The food here is okay, but to be honest not sure why the ratings are so high. We are visiting and came here last night with a couple of friends. First off, getting on the waitlist is sort of confusing. You basically can't call to get on the waitlist but they don't tell you that outright. So if you want to walk in your best bet is to go in person to put your name down. Wish they could be more clear about this. I called twice to check on wait times and they were also unclear about how wait times would be like, plus the second person who picked up was sort of rude and unhelpful. Luckily we came around 8 and were seated after about 15 minutes."
,,,,,Dishes we tried:
,,,,,Broccoli (3/5). Meh. The server (who btw was super friendly and attentive) recommended this but I can make better broccoli at home.
,,,,,"Bone marrow (4.5/5). Probably my favorite dish. The bread was nice and toasty and buttery, marrow was flavorful, and the parsley and capers were a great addition to cut the richness."
,,,,,Crispy pig ear (4/5). Surprisingly better than I expected. Crispy and flavorful with good contrast from the pickled peppers.
,,,,,Tuna tartare (3.5/5). Average. Fish was fresh and flavor was alright.
,,,,,"Pork belly (4/5). Texture was great, the fruity flavor of the sauce/glaze was good but just a bit too sweet. "
,,,,,"Half duck (4/5). Solid dish, not amazing but flavor and texture was nice."
,,,,,"Pork shoulder (4/5). Pretty good dish as well, the meat was tender and came apart easily and the potato mash was good. I think at this point I was kind of tired of all the pork though."
,,,,,All in all this place is alright but for the price point and given all the hype I was disappointed. Plus since we came near closing time they were kind of rushing us towards the end. If you are visiting Chicago you can skip this place unless you don't get to eat good food often lol.
,,,,,"This place has over 7k reviews and has 4.5 stars on Yelp so I was beyond excited to make reservations for my friends and I. We came hungry and eager to try a plate from each category in the menu. We are big foodies and have been traveling all over Chicago going to expensive spots, hole in the walls and hyped restaurants. From Alinea to Portillo. I have to say this was the worst place of them all. The food was salty and unbalanced and unimpressive. The worst part was there was hair in the food . The tuna tartare had a long hair and we didn't want to make it a big deal but we let the staff know and they took the plate asked if we wanted another and that was it. The meal was not compensated let alone the tuna tartare plate. That was wild to me. I would never make a costumer pay for a plate that had a hair on it. Anyways I don't recommend this horrible place. "
,,,,,Tuna tartare -had a hair on 
,,,,,Bone marrow - yummy
,,,,,Milk braised shoulder - salty and umimpressive 
,,,,,Octopus - chewy and lack of flavor 
,,,,,Ragitoni - not bad flavor but how do you mess up cheese and pasta but no texture . Just one flat mushy texture. 
,,,,,Chicago is a town of amazing food so don't waste your time here. I've been to over 22 spots in the last couple months and this is the lowest rating. 3.3/10
,,,,,"THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT AT IN CHICAGO!!!! Wow!!!! Everything was AMAZING!!!!! My mouth waters still thinking about it. My favorites were the Burrata and the Ravioletti. The wine was delicious, server was fantastic and overall atmosphere was a 10/10"
,,,,,"Service was good. And food was okay. Their portions weren't very impressive & the cost is quite high. I noticed they move their restaurant. I've heard such great things about this restaurant and although food was good; it just wasn't THAT good. They have a $20 non refundable deposit to reserve a table. I assume it's cause of the pandemic and they don't want to hold a table for a no show. Everyone was socially distanced and staffs were wearing masks so it looks like they're honoring the safety guidelines. They also checked our temperature upon arrival. I definitely don't regret coming to try the food but don't think I'll go back just because the price is too high, portion size isn't too impressive, & food was just average."
,,,,,"My partner and I went to and were blown away by the food quality as well as the service. For the snacks, we had the Whipped Feta and Pork Liver Bacon Pate. Then for the meat, we had Pork Ribs and Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder. This is, without a doubt, one of, if not the finest, meals we've ever had. They have the nicest staff, they are very helpful and welcoming. The interior is superb too. I was amazed at first sight. I can't say enough good things about this place! Such a pleasant and inviting atmosphere! This resto truly deserves a five star. Even though the price is a little bit pricey, it's still worth the money and effort to drive here. And next time, I will bring my friends here. Like, maybe I'll suggest this resto for our reunion next month.  Because they will definitely love this place for sure"
,,,,,"For was very good and creative. Some of the portions are a little small, even for tapas. Will definitely be back next time visiting Chicago"

,,,,,"Delightful dinner with attentive friendly service. The menu is strong with attractive bits and bites and an extensive wine list. The pork and bacon pate was creamy and flavorful, loved the grape mostarda. The octopus was delicate and roasty. The soecial of the evening was a succulent cut of tender pork - perfectly cooked. Absolutely pleasurable dinner from start to finish."
,,,,,"The service was literally the best!!!  And the food was really good as well. The best things were absolutely the pork belly and the octopus, both to die for!! We also got the pig tongue and pig ear which we both could have done without, but the service was absolutely top notch"
,,,,,Love the vibe and the foods 
,,,,,"The service is ok, but the location is perfect for company's event "
,,,,,Definitely will be back
,,,,,"In the Magnificent Mile where many businesses and restos abound, I found Purple Pig just walking by the nondescript 444 office building. Then my Yelp reviews confirmed by decision."
,,,,,"A group of 6 of us came and shared many dishes together, below are some of the things we really liked. Everyone found dishes that they were really excited about on the menu."
,,,,,"The pork belly in particular stood but because it was so tender and flavorful but not too heavy. Every dish was very tasty, nicely presented and perfect for sharing. "
,,,,,Service was very fast and the waiters always came at a good time for plate changes and to offer more coffee and drinks - highly recommend!
,,,,,"We were just amazed at everything. Thankfully, we left koi in Evanston which is a clown car wreck. Didn't think it would be so hard to have some soup that tastes like soup, unlike that awful stuff at koi. Sushi is on point. Would totally recommend this place for any occasion!"
,,,,,"I've heard quite a bit about the Purple Pig,  but never found the time to go. This morning, we decided to go to their brunch. I am glad I did as it was one of the best brunches I have ever had in the city. "
,,,,,"I started out with a Paloma which was expertly made. We decided to go with the charcuterie board with sopressa and duck procuttio . Both are made in house. I thought the sopressa was excellent and the duck was ok. I think I'll go with another meat next time. The cheese was outstanding, but expected. The surprising Star was the bread....mmmmmmm. This board was the real deal. This seems like the thing to get with wine! "
,,,,,"My group shared three dishes: Chicken and Waffles, Avocado Toast, and French omelette. The omelette was expected, but excellent. A solid dish! The surprise was the Avocado Toast  which was a guacamole with the acid coming from the olives and cucumbers. It was a weird combo, but it worked! The chicken and waffles were the best I've ever had! The waffle was more savory than sweet which I loved. The chicken was pretty epic too! "
,,,,,"Yes, this place is pretty pricey, but well worth the price! I knew it was good, but I never imagined it would be THAT good! One of the best brunches I've had in Chicago, no question!"
,,,,,"This review is way overdue!  When I think about memorable meals in Chicago I think of the Purple Pig.  My fiancé and I went last year in September and had the best experience.  The food is just wonderful!  We ordered a charcuterie board, the milk braised pork, and the duck.  Everything was just fantastic!  I know the milk braised pork is a favorite and I understand why now!  The pork was so tender and full of flavor.  The duck was wonderful as well, again full of flavor and very rich.  We paired everything with red wine like you should.  Our service was perfect.  I know it's been a while since I've been back but I'll be taking a friend that is visiting town in September, can't wait."
,,,,,"Walked in on Labor Day weekend and half-expected it to be packed, and it was, but due to timing (early afternoon) was able to get a table in relatively short time. "
,,,,,Service was less than desirable but staff was apologetic and did the best job they could. These days it's hard to be upset when people are serving you. Our table wondered if they were short-staffed. Hope everyone is well. 
,,,,,Food was absolutely amazing! Had the beets and it's quite possibly the best implementation of beets I've ever had. Salt roasted with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter. That last component takes the beets from really good to great! Would kill for the recipe. 
,,,,,"The other thing that was off the charts was the mussels dish. They were really tiny ""payoffs""inside the shell, but in a red sauce with pork belly bits? Wow! Never had mussels cooked in this style and can't wait to have it again. "
,,,,,"Everything else was really good - tuna tartare, the octopus with its delightful green beans, great shrimp dish, and a wonderful ravioletto. Amazing selection of wines including something Croatian with a funky smell which definitely was different. As a seasoned wine drinker, the smell of this wine was weird at first, but with all the amazing food it went down just fine. This is how you discover new things!! "
,,,,,Already looking forward to my next trip here. What fun and amazing food! Bravo!
,,,,,Great customer service! COVID protocols are in place. Staff and patrons are wearing masks. Waitress was sensitive to my alleges. Gave me of menu of what I could have without onions. Very warm and welcoming. Went here for a drink and lunch. Many different options. Definitely try this spot.

,,,,,"To me when I go to a restaurant it's all about the entire experience of the meal, and as soon as my party of five arrived we were greeted with very unwelcoming faces and a lot of attitude from the host and staff, first telling us that we had to be out by 5:45 because they had a reservation for that table, (it was 3:00 when we arrived) I definitely don't think that we ever would've stayed almost three hours and even if I wanted to the place was empty I'm sure they could've accommodated us, immediately I was upset due to the rudeness and stern attitude of the man and woman who seated us, our waiter was attentive and friendly but I had already been ticked of from the rude welcome I really couldn't relax my entire meal, which turned out to be very good. I enjoyed every plate that came out, but because of how we were treated I do not think I will be returning."
,,,,,"On my 35th birthday I finally got to try The Purple Pig after all these years. Every time I've gone in the past, I haven't had any luck because they usually don't take reservations and the wait was always so long; however, because of COVID-19, they are now taking reservations!"
,,,,,They definitely lived up to the hype after all these years and I was super happy with all the menu items we ordered. My favorite dish was the crispy pig ears with kale. It was like having elevated Chicharrón with crispy kale. The pickled banana peppers added the proper amount of acidity and the yolk from the fried egg soaked up all the flavors perfectly.
,,,,,"If you're looking for comfort food, the milk braise pork shoulder provided all of that. The gravy was mind blowing! Throw in some great cocktails and wine pairings and The Purple Pig is the perfect casual-chic restaurant for tourists and locals alike! You can't go wrong with any menu item here!"
,,,,,"This place is for sharing! We ordered several plates : tuna tartare, burrata, pork belly, pork shoulder, and cauliflower. We enjoyed everything we ordered but will say that the plates were very small portions and not ""big"" like they claim. The burrata was my favorite!! Would come back for that any day!"
,,,,,"Came to chicago to feast because this is a city filled to the brim with good restaurants. Of course purple pig was on that list and I had to see if the hype was worth it. We ended up getting delivery since we didn't have time to go in person. I'm sure food would've been much more palatable in person; therefore, take this review with a grain of salt."
,,,,,"We ordered three items: crispy pig ear, pork shoulder w/ the mashed potatoes, and the chicken thigh kebab. Now, I thought all three things were pretty delicious but I also didn't think they were phenomenal. We paid good money and received a good meal; I am glad we tried it but this isn't something I'd go back and eat again. "
,,,,,"The crispy pig ear was a little overly salty. I've eaten so much pig ear this past month....thai style and chinese style; it was interesting to see a mediterranean take on it. My favorite part of this dish was honestly the crispy kale underneath. The pickled banana peppers were TOO salty and took away from the balance of flavors. The milk braised berkshire shoulder was cooked well; I really have no complaints about it except I can probably make it at home. The chicken thigh kebab had a great tzatziki sauce that I couldn't get enough of, otherwise the kebab itself was quite uninspired. "
,,,,,"Overall, nice meal and happy with the experience."
,,,,,If you are looking for a good wine and tapas place in Chicago this is the way to go!! 
,,,,,We came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30am and it wasn't too busy. The service was great and our server told us how it works here as it's mostly shared plates so about 5 plates was good for the 4 of us. 
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,crispy pig ears - these were way too salty for my taste but I liked the crunch
,,,,,ricotta gnocchi-so cheesy and decadent but definitely heavy!
,,,,,the bacon and liver pate-this was my absolute fav!!! It was so tasty
,,,,,the pork belly-so tender and fatty with a really good sauce
,,,,,The rib hash off the brunch menu-I loved that it came with an egg and the rib meat was tender.
,,,,,Really good shared plates and they had a good selection of wine and cocktails!
,,,,,"We had an excellent meal at the Purple Pig. It had been on my ""list"" for years and I'm so happy I finally made it. "
,,,,,"To start, our server was fabulous - she let us know which items were the most popular, which were her favorites and those to stay away from because ""they're not super special."" We really appreciated her honest advice and her desire to make our meal as great as possible. "
,,,,,"This is a tapas restaurant, so they suggest that you stagger order items throughout your meal. The servings were larger than other tapas places I've visited, so we ended up ordering less dishes. "
,,,,,"We started with the whipped feta and toast. The feta was topped with cucumbers and sautéed tomatoes and the toast was super buttery and flavorful. Next, we tried the broccoli, which our server said was the ""best broccoli we'd ever have."" It was really good - dressed in a Caesar-like sauce and sprinkled with breadcrumbs. The favorite of some of our party was the pork belly - if you're a meat eater, you should order the pork belly! Another hit was the ricotta gnocchi - topped with pork ""gravy."" The gravy was more like a red pork sauce. This was the most light and fluffy gnocchi I've ever had (our server said, unlike most gnocchi, it was made with 80% ricotta and 20% wheat). We also tried the whipped chickpea spread that was served with toasted focaccia. The bread was very similar to the toast served with the whipped feta dish. "
,,,,,Tuesday they have a special where all the still rosés are $9. 
,,,,,"They also have an extensive wine list, charcuterie options, and a short beer list. The only thing that I'd give lower than 5 stars for was the ambiance. Since it's located in an office building, some parts of the restaurant feel less comfortable and welcoming than others. Ask to be seated closer to the back of the restaurant- away from the glass windows that look out into the lobby."
,,,,,Absolutely loved this place! Pricey but the octopus was sooo worth it. Super tender and flavorful. The hummus dip was also great with the focaccia bread as an appetizer. The chicken kebab was probably my least favorite but the smashed potatoes that came with it were a chef's kiss!
,,,,,"One of the best meals I ever had.   The presentation and varied options were good.  But the food was unique in every dish, rich in flavor and beautifully presented."
,,,,,"One of the most amazing experiences! The ambiance was perfect, and the dishes were executed in an innovative fashion. Each dish is shareable, and what a better way then to enhance the romance on our anniversary. The servers are not constantly interrupting your experience. Their approach was perfect. Set down the dish and tell us about it if need be, let us observe the dish and taste it while watching from afar to see our reactions, reapproach and inquire how the dish is and if we need anything and then leave us to finish before the next comes out. All the dishes are served one at a time so not to get cold or warm while sitting. This allows the chef to prepare and serve the dish in the way it was intended to be experienced. Also this allows for each guest to not be overwhelmed by all of the dishes."
,,,,,"Every time I am in Chicago, I stop by Purple Pig. This place has a great atmosphere. The food is delicious and the service is superb. I was seated within 5 minutes. The server constantly check up on me if I needed anything and all of the food that I ordered were great. I ordered the bone marrow, pork liver pate, pork belly and mussels. Out of all of the dishes my favorite is the pork belly and bone marrow. The pork belly was so juicy and tender and just melts when you take a bite. There is also a ginger glaze on it which makes the flavor pairing so well. I also enjoyed the bone marrow with a pinch of sea salt on the bread makes the perfect flavor. I would recommend this restaurant every time you come to Chicago."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,This place was so delicious. I absolute liked everything. Cannot recommend it enough. The salt roasted beets were amazing. From the main dishes I loved the duck and octopus the most. Would definitely go again. Everything on the menu sounded incredible.
,,,,,"Everything we had was amazing! Pictured are the Ravioletto, Ricotta and Mushroom Agnolotti, and the Osso Buco. We also got the fried manchego but forgot to get a picture! Looking forward to going back and trying more of the menu!"
,,,,,"The restaurant has a really nice ambience with great looking tiles and right amount of lights. Service was great and the servers were all attentive and knowledgeable. We had the roasted bone marrow for that Instagram pictur, the milk braised Berkshire shoulder so we don't have to use teeth at all, and the honeynut squash to help balance out the heaviness of the pork dish. The rich and butter-like marrow paired well with the refreshing lime+parsley+cilantro salad (toast was great too). The soft meat and the mashed potatoes well complemented the bacon-bits-like, crispy lentils. Overall, the food was very well balanced. Would definitely come again and try the suggested wine pairing with the food!"
,,,,,"What a fantastic last dinner during our latest trip to Chicago! From the artistic plating to big bold flavors, all with special attention to vegetarian inclusion, you nailed it Purple Pig. The three of us vegetarians at the table ordered 5 dishes to share and found that to be the perfect volume (could have potentially added a 6th if ravenous). The whipped feta was a perfect balance of salty creaminess with accents of diced cucumber and juicy tomatoes. The whipped chickpea and focaccia smear was a standout--the focaccia more brioche style, acting as a perfect vehicle for the rich purée with pops of well-paired rosemary. The burrata (sans prosciutto) is a show-stopper with the crispy wheel floating above pillowy burrata elevated by sweet roasted butternut and peppery arugula. The salt-roasted beets are a must order, with this preparation exquisitely highlighting the deep beet flavor, enriched by the goat cheese and pistachio accents. And closing out the meal, the agnolotti. Perfectly cooked al dente packets bursting with creamy ricotta and tangy balsamic, with a nice brown butter glaze. Will be dreaming about this meal for some time!  Can't wait for our next visit."
,,,,,Cute restaurant. Tuna tartare presentation was amazing. Also was so delicious. The beets were all very tasty. Milk Braised Berkshire Pork Shoulder was a little salty but very good as well. Service was good. Staff was all very friendly. Great place.
,,,,,"Wanted to try here due to the popularity and reviews. Made reservations two weeks in advance. The service was good and the food was good as well. Tapas style plates that can be shared. The portions are huge! We only had three items and one drink each. We were too full for dessert. My favorite was the roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and pistachio nuts with a peanut butter smear! What a combination of flavors! Next was the octopus it was grilled to perfection, the salsa verde accompaniment was ok with the potatoes, asparagus, and green beans. The crispy pig ears was my least favorite. It was ok.. the fried ear pieces were like onion ring pieces and I did not enjoy it as much as I was hoping. I really wanted to try some other items but was stuffed! Would definitely return here to try some of the other items if I'm in town."
,,,,,"Everything we had was delicious! Pig ears with kale ! Noodle ,pork shoulder mash potatoes,  broccoli, steak! Everything was amazing! Went there twice in five days!!!! Can't get enough of it wish y'all had a location in California!"
,,,,,"Yes, it lives up to the hype! My family of three shared the crispy pig ear, chicken thigh kebabs and braised pork belly for lunch. Every.single.ingredient in each dish was well thought out and complimented each other to pack in the flavor. Our LO could not get enough of the crispy pig ear dish, especially the kale.  The chicken kebabs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the pork belly was the best pork belly I've ever had! Honestly, I've been craving it since! Herberito was our waiter and he was super friendly and informative. They didn't have sangria in the drink menu, but he did his best and it was good! Everyone was wearing a mask (besides diners at their tables) and they even took our temp upon arrival.  They also made sure to space out the customers. It was a memorable foodie experience and I can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,"Busy at lunch time, octopus is ok, not the way I like, but pork belly is fantastic, the best pork belly I've never had."
,,,,,"Came here for the first time yesterday and the food and drinks were great! Service was understandably a little slow given COVID and shortages in help. We ordered the burrata, fried manchego cheese, and the Spanish octopus. All very yummy!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,I loved the service at the bar-- my tender was even better at describing the menu than expected. The super helpful and inviting staff added to the very good experience here.
,,,,,"I'm not one to hate on hyped restaurants for the sake of not being mainstream.... but wow, I was really disappointed by Purple Pig. Personally, everything just seemed bland. We ordered the crispy pig ears, the pork shoulder, and ravioletto. The crispy pork ears had us in the first half, but gradually became a sodium overload over the course of the meal. I wish there were more egg or pickled vegetables in the dish to offset the saltiness. The pork shoulder was incredibly bland from the gravy to the meat to the mashed potatoes. I'm a huge pasta fanatic and was let down by the ravioletto, which again tasted very plain despite its rich ingredients. I personally wouldn't take any friends here if they were visiting."
,,,,,"With nearly 7.5k reviews on Yelp, many of them glowing with stellar praise, plus a prime location on the Magnificent Mile, The Purple Pig has a reputation that certainly reaches beyond Chicago. "
,,,,,"My friends and I had both heard good things about the restaurant and decided on a whim to add ourselves to the waitlist. While we were told the wait would be 2.5 hours at our call, we were texted a mere 10 minutes later telling us that if we could make it to the restaurant within 15 minutes, we would have a table. So off we sprinted into the 93 degree heat of the Midwest summer, that enticing promise of ""cheese, swine, and wine"" like a carrot on a stick propelling us up stairs and with blatant disregard for traffic laws. "
,,,,,"The Purple Pig is a well-lit restaurant with a cheery ambiance, a bright bar and red booths creating an atmosphere both airy and comforting. We were seated at a high table next to the bar area, giving us a central location to ooh and aah over what everyone else was ordering."
,,,,,"Immediately after seeing it carried past our table, we knew we had to start with the tuna tartare [$24]. Its unique, eye-catching presentation revealed a generous and tasty portion of tuna, with an uncommon touch of pistachio adding texture to the dish. We also tried the popular crispy pig's ear [$19]. From sisig to liang ban mala zhu er, pig's ear is one of the most underrated portions of meat, and definitely one of my favorites due to its addictive taste, so I was excited to see The Purple Pig's interpretation. I had mixed feelings on this dish- it worked well as a snackable item and was objectively tasty and fun to eat, but I felt that perhaps something was missing, and I wish that there had been more textural contrast between the crispy-fried texture and the slightly crunchy yet gelatinous texture of pig's ears. In the end, it was tasty but this preparation didn't knock my socks off. "
,,,,,"For entrees, we ordered the squid ink tagliatelle [$22], ravioletto [$19], and milk braised Berkshire shoulder [$23]. The tagliatelle was delicious, with the cherry tomatoes a perfect complement to the seafood flavors. However, the pasta was cooked slightly over al dente, not a major fault. The ravioletto was okay; given the ingredients, I was anticipating to receive a greater shock of flavor, but it seemed to have more of a one-note profile- a rich and warm single note, but could have benefited from more complexity. The pork shoulder was incredibly soft- I could have eaten the whole dish with a spoon. It was hearty and satisfying, but again I found myself wishing for a tiny hint of brightness or sweetness to further elevate the dish (something with fruit would have been fantastic!)- especially since, as previous reviewers have commented, it was on the salty side. As someone who has long since come to terms with my eventual spiral into hypertension, however, I didn't mind the level of salt. That being said, we generally enjoyed all of the entrees, and the portions and quality were generous for the price and location. "
,,,,,"We finished with the Sicilian iris [$11]; we had hoped to order the bombalone as well, but the kitchen ran out. The iris was a satisfying end to our meal, a crispy brioche filled with a mixture of ricotta and slightly melted chocolate chips akin to that of cannoli. Not transcendent, but certainly delicious and very dangerous. If they started selling these more commonly in stores, my waistline would certainly be in trouble. "
,,,,,"To drink, I had the Wallflower [$15]. My friends had the Paper Plane [$15] and a glass of the Picpoul [$13], the latter of which was the recommended pairing with the tagliatelle. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, and found that they went well with the dishes we ordered. When combined with the pork shoulder, I found that the Wallflower provided that brightness I was looking for! "
,,,,,"Service was okay- dishes came out quickly, and front of house was very sweet. Our waiter was a bit mercurial, fluctuating between helpful kindness and mildly pretentious standoffishness, which threw us for a loop a few times when trying to order. However, our experience at The Purple Pig as a whole was greatly positive- pricing was very fair all things considered and the food was creative and thoughtful. I was slightly underwhelmed (expectations perhaps being inflated due to the many positive reviews), but I would love to return sometime to try their other dishes."
,,,,,"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The food is incredible, but the presentation is out of this world. My best experiences at the Purple Pig have been with groups of around 4-6 because you can order many things on the menu and try everything out. The only thing that threw me off was the restaurant itself is in a corporate office building, so it was not the ambience I was expecting, but I would still go back time and time again for the food!"
,,,,,"A super popular joint so we had to try it. Cool ambiance, pretty hipster. I loved the roasted beets, so good! The squid ink pasta was bland for my taste. The cheesecake was huge! Can definitely share with 2-4 people depending how much you want to eat. It's different, it's made from goat cheese and you can taste it. I still don't know how I feel about it. Service was extremely fast. Their menu is meant to be shared, tapas style except the portions are pretty big. I'd come back."
,,,,,"Have wanted to come here so many times when I have visited Chicago and was very excited to finally go. One of my favorite meals ever. The bread might have been the best ever--the focaccia and cornbread were amazing and the truffle butter was perfect. Also had the burrata, tuna tartare and the pork chop. Everything was tasty and beautiful."
,,,,,Can't wait go back.
,,,,,If you're ever on #michiganavenue try to stop in @thepigchicago !
,,,,,"So many delish, unique dishes. I recently stopped in for a quick bit and cocktails and sat at the bar the bartenders have always been solid. They can make you a specialty cocktail in case nothing floats your boat off the menu. A+ effort and service."
,,,,,"In photo: Burrata Di Puglia -Prosciutto, Arugula, Fig and Grape Mostarda"
,,,,,"Absolutely great experience here. Although the wait was long, it was well worth it. We had a couple of cocktails at the bar. What we thought was casual conversation with one of the bartenders, ended up being a very attentive manager who listened to what we had to say and even sent a drink over on the house. No, it's not about a free drink, rather the point that he listened and showed interest in what we liked. The food was ALL delicious. Can't really go wrong. Although I'm a fan of steaks and protein, the broccoli was beyond words of explanation. Great service, reasonable pricing and great cocktails!!"
,,,,,"Super yummy food, great service and cute atmosphere. Visiting Chicago and wanted to try it out. I would recommend making a reservation if your coming later on, but during the day you can probably get a seat without one. Gnocchis are amazing along with the broccoli. Also good lighting for cute pics! Xoxo"
,,,,,"This has long been one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, and it did NOT disappoint on a recent trip back home.  Hubs and I met fellow foodie friends for an early dinner.  Of course we got the pig ear (1 for each couple!) and a nice collection of several other sharing plates.  Tuna tartare, bacon wrapped shrimp (prob my least favorite, TBH), Cauliflower and beets.  Probably the star of our visit (at least for me) was the Ravioletto.  Just enough for each of us to have a bite, but the memory lasted with that savory creamy truffle-y goodness--I was still thinking about it several days later!  Pork belly and ribs finished up the meal and even though I was full, could not resist, especially the ribs.  No to-go boxes needed. "
,,,,,Service was fantastic as always--we asked for a wine recommendation after we ordered and our server picked a great red for the table (of which we had two bottles).  The new location is bigger and nicely spaced out.  
,,,,,Purple Pig never disappoints! And I can't wait to go back for more of that ravioletto.. .
,,,,,"One of the best dinners I've had in Chicago. There wasn't a single thing I didn't enjoy. We got mushrooms, pasta, octopus, and a 1/2 duck and finished it all between 2 people. It was so much food but it was too good not to finish! I'd come back in a heartbeat because I'm sure everything on the menu is good!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO!
,,,,,Reservations are hard to come by but luckily ours were made a month or so in advance.
,,,,,The concept here is farm to table and everything is meant to be shared. 
,,,,,"It was everyone's first time at the restaurant so we asked the waitress to recommend a few dishes, which we all ordered, and everything did not disappoint. Our favorite dish of the night was the duck; not a single morsel was left behind."
,,,,,100% recommend to snag a reservation if you're in the area!
,,,,,Here for the ~memories~
,,,,,"Our order: squid ink tagliatelle, foie gras mousse, pork shoulder, grilled broccoli, roasted bone marrow."
,,,,,"Purple pig is where my partner and I had our first date, and we've made a point to dine here every time we visited Chicago, until we moved out west. Didn't have a Yelp account back then haha. I was sad to see the location change and consequent change of interior design, as I loved the previous wooden walls, dark ambiance and quirky art. We were here for a quick lunch before our flight, and I'm happy that they have kept majority of their menu. I'm happier that the dishes were just as great as I had remembered them, maybe a tad saltier but overall consistent from four, five years ago. Still the best roasted bone marrow I've had and a truly amazing pork shoulder that melts in your mouth. Grilled broccoli is tart snd tangy so skip if you're not into that! Perfectly cooked scallops with the tagliatelle, could use a little more marinara though. Can't go wrong with foie gras - creamy and buttery. "
,,,,,"Busy busy, the servers and staff worked tirelessly to ensure the seamless experiences of all their patrons."
,,,,,"After all the hype from everyone, we were truly disappointed with the food. The bone marrow tasted much like spreading butter on toast, very soft and an interesting texture for those who has never had it. We felt like it could've had more flavor, as it tasted very bland and had way too much cilantro. Also definitely not worth the price. "
,,,,,The pork Berkshire was so so so salty that I could not take a second bite... so my partner ate most of it. If you're worried about hypertension this is not the dish for you. 
,,,,,"The worst part was the octopus, which was so incredibly acidic that it wasn't edible. It was like eating a lemon. Every component of the dish was acidic, there was no balance in flavors. Our waitress was very nice and sent it back, giving us the option to have the beets instead, which ended up being our favorite dish. The pecan butter that came with it was honestly my favorite part of the meal. "
,,,,,"Overall, the service is excellent but I will not return for the food. It's just hard to understand how such a well-rated restaurant could over-season and under-season dishes to such extreme."
,,,,,"We had the BEST experience at The Purple Pig! It was myself and three friends and we ordered a number of dishes to share. We really liked every dish we ordered and were assured by our server that we made great choices. We each ranked the dishes we had from best to worst - but even the ""worst"" was delicious. The tuna tartare was my favorite. My least favorite was the bacon wrapped shrimp, as the shrimp tasted a bit overcooked, but again it was all still delicious! I would definitely recommend this place for those visiting Chicago and wanting a place for tapas!"
,,,,,"Amazing restaurant right in Michigan Ave, perfect girls night or date night spot. My 2 besties and I were able to share all of the dishes we ordered. We asked our waitress for suggestions and her picks were delicious, the burrata, the beets and wow the pork belly was amazing! Great drinks, tasty desserts, pricey but we split it 3 ways. I will definitely go again, the next time I'm in the city!"
,,,,,"Came with my friends and even though I trash talked the food we got a little, it was well done and gave me some new recipe inspirations. I think it was around $120 for four different dishes."
,,,,,Milk braised pork shoulder - 4/5. Milk braised to tenderize and drenched in gravy and served atop mashed potatoes. This was very tasty! Will definitely be finding some copy cat recipes online to add this to my food rotation
,,,,,"Gnocci - 4/5. Was told by our server this is 95% cheese and 5% flour, it tastes the part! Tasted like a a cheese stuffed shell. Very soft and the sauce was delicious!"
,,,,,"Spanish Octopus - 4/5. Braised in red wine to gently, served with green beans and some green sauce. This was very tasty! Would definitely try to make this in the future for my own food rotation."
,,,,,"Fried pig ear - 3/5. Deep fried pig ear, served with kale and diced banana peppers. This was tasty, but I didn't feel like I got any pig ear taste, it could've been deep fried anything. Otherwise, the banana peppers gave a nice brightness to the dish that contrasted well with the slightly fatty/greasy pig ears and the slightly bitter kale"
,,,,,"Came for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon, and there was no wait. We were seated instantly, and our waitress was super sweet and gave us a quick rundown of the most popular items. Service throughout our meal was spot on."
,,,,,"To counter some of the other reviews, the food we received was not too salty; maybe a bit on the saltier side, but nothing that was unpleasantly salty. Portions were a bit on the smaller side, but I've seen worse at other places. "
,,,,,"We got the daily special, which was sort of like a breakfast sandwich with a pork and truffle sausage - this was the best dish we had for lunch. The sausage was juicy and tender, and the truffle was subtle but present, not overpowering at all. I would order this again just for the sausage."
,,,,,"The next dish we were served was the bone marrow, which was honestly a bit on the disappointing side; it's hard to justify paying $25 for a piece of bone marrow with some toasted brioche and a parsley salad. Maybe my expectations were too high before trying it, but I won't be getting this again. "
,,,,,"Finally, we got the milk braised Berkshire shoulder. It was a solid hunk of meat, and they really focused on the quality of the pork; the pork came with a rich gravy and some pepper, but the pork was the star of the dish. (The wine pairing, a Babic Riserva, went well with this dish.)"
,,,,,"Overall, the place is a bit overpriced, but there are some solid items on the menu. Service is fantastic! I would give this around a 3.5/5 because of the price and portion size, but it was a pretty nice experience."
,,,,,"I've waited a along time to come here, it's never seemed to work out with my schedule when i have been in chicago.  I was definitely not disappointed.  the staff was attentive but not overbearing.  I ordered several of the recommendations of the waiter.  the squid ink pasta was very good, the hanger steak was excellent, and i'd absolutely recommend the beets.  Can't wait to return here."
,,,,,Playful twists on classic dishes. I'm so impressed by the cocktail/wine menu. A ton of care clearly went into it. 
,,,,,Probably worth a reservation a few weeks prior to dining. Go hungry and be prepared to share plates.
,,,,,"Forget Chicago deep dish pizza. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go straight to The Purple Pig."
,,,,,I didn't expect much from this place -- I knew almost nothing about it. My daughter picked it. We went for lunch and it was one of the best meals of my life. Not exaggerating.
,,,,,"We had the Potatoes & Tomatoes, the Tuna Tartare, and the Mussels. Everything was delectable. Might be the best mussels I've ever had. And I'm 53 years old. I want to go back and try everything on the menu."
,,,,,The wine list was also phenomenal -- great list of wines by the glass; very affordable. Service was fantastic.
,,,,,A bit noisy due to all the hard surfaces but we did not mind. The music was really good. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"OK, I'm still gonna get deep dish tonight. But don't miss The Purple Pig."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,My friends and I had dinner at The Purple Pig and it was amazing! Their tapas style dishes were a perfect way to try everything. My friends and I ordered:
,,,,,Tuna Tartare - perfect in every way and very good portion. Highly recommend 
,,,,,"JLT - such a good blend of flavors with the pork jowl, egg, and arugula! I loved it!"
,,,,,"Orecchiette - my first time trying it and I was so good! A little on the salty side,  but would totally get it again!"
,,,,,"Mushroom agnolotti - if you love butter, you'll love this dish! Very rich in flavor, but nice and light "
,,,,,Service was great and very clean! Post COVID has limited capacity so make sure you make a reservation!
,,,,,"I've heard about purple pig from my friends who live in Chicago and was wondering if it lived up to the hype! Sadly, for me... it didn't quite live up to its name. "
,,,,,The ambience/vibe of the restaurant is bustling with an upscaled pub-like feel.  The service was great. The presentations of the food was splendid.
,,,,,It was the entrees that left me feel a bit disappointed. It just didn't quite fit my taste buds. With that said... the crispy pig ears is a must-try. It's certainly crispy! Definitely do not expect this dish to fill you up though. The Spanish octopus was a bit disappointing - there was a fishy odor to it that made me not like it. The pork ribs is a bit salty for my taste but the sauce is quite zesty and each bite melts in your mouth. 
,,,,,"Overall, it's a pretty good restaurant, but considering it's price ($~25 per entree) and reputation, I'm just not sure it lives up to its hype. I would have given a 3.5, but given that there's no option in Yelp for that, I'll round it up to 4.0."
,,,,,"It is hard to get a reservation here if you don't plan in advance but we were able to get a table without a wait at around 7pm on a Wednesday night, even though there were no spots available when I tried to reserve online. I imagine Friday nights and weekends are a longer wait. "
,,,,,"Our waitress was very friendly and eager to give us recommendations. We ended up getting the crispy pig ears, pork shank osso bucco, and squid ink tagliatelle. The pig ear came out first. It was crispy, and it came with crispy fried kale, and some sort of pickled vegetable. The fried egg on top was much needed to offset how heavy and salty this dish is. I was surprised since this was probably the most ordered thing on Yelp but it was difficult to finish since every component on the plate was fried and salty. It was okay but wouldn't order again, I would try other apps. "
,,,,,"The squid ink tagliatelle was our favorite dish. The pasta tasted house made and it came with a generous portion of shrimp and scallops. The cherry tomato sauce was nice and sweet, we enjoyed this dish best and we almost didn't order pasta! The pork shank osso bucco had highs and lows. The actual pork was amazing, fork tender, and in a tasty sauce. It came with what I think was collard greens and beans. The beans were fine but the greens were so salty! We couldn't take more than a few bites. Maybe the sauce was reduced too much and concentrated the salt but we were disappointed that we had to leave some behind on the plate."
,,,,,Great wine great food and great service!
,,,,,"If I need to say anything bad about this restaurant, it would be that the food were just too delicious that I could not stop eating!!!"
,,,,,I loved all the food I ordered and I could not stop checking out other peoples food at the tables nearby and everything just look amazing!
,,,,,Update: came back 3 years later and still love it here. The broccoli still is the star of the show. Service is quick and friendly and the food is exceptional.
,,,,,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT! So sad I was living too much in the moment and didn't get pictures of the lamb chops. So I remember the octopus, broccoli, and lamb being amazing. There's a really good wine selection too. The service is great and the overall vibe and ambiance of the spot were awesome. This meal was one of the highlights of my first trip to Chicago. Can't wait to come again!"
,,,,,"The purple pig is one of the most reviewed restaurants, but also ironically onem alot of people dont know about. Maybe because its in this building thats kind of hidden, or maybe non pork eaters stay away. The food is pretty special here pork or not. Infact the tuna tartare was one of the best i ever had. We also had the pork shoulder and pork belly, all great! The Sicilian Iris was a little disappointing. Really wish the restaurant was in a stand alone building. But other then that pretty solid.."
,,,,,As you might've heard they started taking reservations because of COVID. Highly recommend you roll through!
,,,,,"Service is amazing with the recommendations the waiters give. Decor is awesome, ambience and lighting are great - especially on a cold Chicago night. "
,,,,,"The place encourages you to order dishes however you like - total freedom to choose, no getting boxed in with appetizers and mains and getting looked at like you're a freak when you order too many apps. Crispy pig's ears are as awesome as advertised, Spanish octopus is exquisite (so tender!), and the meat - pork belly, pork jowl, and gyros - are the best thing to happen since Devin White. Go Bucs."
,,,,,Each dish has a really unique texture and it can be really fun to deconstruct how they're cooked and check your guesses with the waiters. Give it a shot!
,,,,,Okay so I really wish that we could do 1/2 stars. This place is better than a 3 but not quite a 4 for me. 
,,,,,I came to Chicago for a friends birthday and she wanted to eat here. The restaurant is located inside of a building and it was decorated. It's def a vibe! The waitress was very nice and we ordered almost everything she recommended. This isn't the place you come to when you're hungry. The food was good but it's definitely different flavors and animal parts. Lol
,,,,,I would come back but only for like a boujee girls night. The prices are on the higher side but the portions are on the smaller side and I was hungry. Lol
,,,,,"Was the highlight of my Chicago trip. I was able to make a lunch reservation fairly easily by calling in on a Monday afternoon. We were seated promptly and the waitress gave us a rundown on what's popular and things to get. No surprise, she mentioned the Bone Marrow (which we were going to get anyway) the Grilled broccoli, and Crispy Pig Ears. We got all three of them. The Bone Marrow was LEGIT. Perfectly roasted, generous amount of salt, paired with herbs (believe they were parsley from memory), and nice toasted bread. It was like spreading butter onto the bread, so smooth and good! I would get this EVERY TIME."
,,,,,"The Grilled broccoli was also very tasty. Love how they could turn such a basic vegetable into something so full of flavor but not too overpowering with the vinaigrette. The Crispy Pig Ears were a little too salty for my taste but most of my party enjoyed it. In addition to these, we also got the Pork Belly. Was pretty good, the meat very soft and easy to cut through. The star of the show was definitely still the Bone Marrow though."
,,,,,I docked a star because the bus boys kept incessantly coming back and asking if we were done with our plates when I've said no for like the 5th time. I couldn't tell if it was because they were trying to be really attentive or just trying to kick us out of the restaurant earlier. 
,,,,,"Aside from that, great experience and definitely deserves the Michelin Big Gourmand in my opinion."
,,,,,James Beard award winning restaurant. It was one of Magnificent Mile's iconic popular dining destinations but has relocated just steps away. 
,,,,,The food is Midwestern Mediterranean with pork being the main theme here. Small plates which are recommended to share. 
,,,,,"The only downside is they do not take reservations. I recommend giving them a try on a beautiful day or night out, and you can leave them your name and number and explore Chicago and or go shopping and they will call you back when your table is ready. You can always call ahead to see how busy they are as well. "
,,,,,"Purple Pig has been around for a decade and it serves everyone. From families, date nights, tourists, and dining with friends. Portions are a bit small but does pack a punch of bold flavors. "
,,,,,"The cornbread was the best cornbread I've ever had in the city. The rest was a bit salty for my taste and for my liking. Will definitely be back if anyone else I know wants to go, but there are many other dining options in the city that takes reservations. I did like their wine menu though!"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"MY colleague and I had walked passed here a couple of times.  Then, on our last night tried it.  There was a 45 min wait for a table, but we found a couple of chairs at the bar, right in front of the kitchen.  It was really perfect."
,,,,,"For the next couple of hours we were entertained by the extraordinary staff preparing some of the most exquisite food.  We were able to see almost everything on the menu pass right by us, which made my choice really difficult.  "
,,,,,"Krystina was fantastic.  She's just taking food to tables, and .. well, it's not just that, because she knew everything on the menu.  The interaction we had with her was fantastic, and truly made the evening.  "
,,,,,"There wasn't one dish I wouldn't have tried, everything was awesome, but I did choose the ribs.  Incredibly tender and amazing flavor.  "
,,,,,The dessert choices were also great.  
,,,,,"I'm so impressed with the food, and the outstanding service that I'm disappointed we didn't come here sooner, as we would have dined more at least one more time during our work visit.  I'm bringing my wife here.  She will LOVE it."
,,,,,This was my third time at the Purple Pig and my family's first. Troy was an absolutely amazing server! He was great with our kids and very attentive. Loved him! The food was over the top!!! So amazing and so much selection. The wine selection is also amazing. Highly recommend and we hope to be back!
,,,,,Definitely delicious. Made reservations in advanced for a Saturday afternoon. Service was great - we were quickly seated and our server gave us a thorough run down of crowd favorites. We ordered pretty much everything she said. 
,,,,,1/2 duck - incredibly tender duck. Served with a sweet bread 
,,,,,Pigs ear - crispy and salty
,,,,,Bone marrow - delicious spread on bread 
,,,,,Cauliflower - pretty good 
,,,,,Spanish octopus - my favorite dish. Incredibly tender octopus (which is usually a pretty chewy animal). Loved the flavor 
,,,,,"Chickpea focaccia - pretty good, interesting texture "
,,,,,"The Purple Pig definitely lives up to the hype! Reservations fill up quickly, and it's a pretty affordable spot for some really great food."
,,,,,"Came here highly recommended by all my coworkers who recently visited Chicago. So we booked this place 3 weeks ahead of time, and came with pretty high expectations. And we were not disappointed! It is located inside the 444 Michigan Ave building. Staff members were not wearing masks. The place was packed and fully booked out because I tried to push my reservation back and could not find any openings. But I also came on Father's Day so not surprised. The staff members were super nice. We ordered a half bottle of the special red wine that was chilled - Podere Pradarolo Indocilis Emilia. It was unlike any red wine we've ever had and even had a slight fizz to it. tasted Very smooth, and apparently is free of any added sulfites. And I'm usually not a red wine person and I enjoyed it very much! "
,,,,,"We started off with the bread for the table, which surprisingly was very tasty, especially the butter they made that was infused with the perfect amount of truffle. We finished all the bread thinking that the rest of the dishes would be super tiny, so we needed to fill up on bread. But boy... that was a mistake. I would only recommend getting the bread for the table if you have 4 people or more. Being Chinese, and having eaten pig ears and pig tongue before, I was curious to see what their take on it would be like. The smoked pig tongue was the most interesting combination of flavors, but tasted so good. Did not think I was eating pig's tongue. Same thing with the crispy pig ears. Did not taste like pig ears at all. They fried it and made it so crispy that it made it nice combo with the kale and the picked banana peppers. "
,,,,,"We then ordered the pork belly, which had a great flavor and was the most tender pork belly that I've ever had. The portion size was also pretty big too. I was expecting like the tiniest pork belly slice ever. But was decently surprised. The half duck was also a very large duck! Did not think they would be giving us such a large portion. The duck was delicious as well, and was so tender and didn't have that gamey taste that duck usually has. They gave you bread to make sandwiches with the duck. But we were so full that we couldn't eat the bread. "
,,,,,"Overall, definitely lives up to the hype. Would highly recommend if you have a chance to make reservations and stop by."
,,,,,"I had a lovely dinner at the Purple Pig. I started with the pork liver pate and it was incredible. The texture was like fois gras, but the flavor had a smoky pork undertone. Truly unique and delicious. The bread and jam that the pate came with were top notch. "
,,,,,I tried the ricotta gnocchi with a half portion of beets. The beets were garnished with crushed pistachios and a pistachio butter and topped with a goat cheese foam. It was as good as it sounds. The pasta was handmade and light and fluffy; the Bolognese sauce was hearty and delicious. 
,,,,,"For dessert, I had the lemon tarte and it was a fabulous end to a perfect dinner. The Purple Pig will be my first stop next time I'm in Chicago."
,,,,,"Phenomenal place. Surprisingly easy to get reservations. The location is awesome just at the end or beginning of Michigan Ave, although parking hard to find. the place is cozy and always packed. Food items are amazing. Portions are definitely intended for sharing. Been here twice. Loved the beets, tartare, chicken, squid pasta, cheesecake. Service is quick and efficient. Prices actually reasonable. All in all, phenomenal place and of my favorites in the city. Highly recommend. Will defined come here again."
,,,,,I'm always a bit wary of going to restaurants that are hyped up so much as they usually fall short of expectations but Purple Pig was definitely not the case. The vibe the food the people all amazing.
,,,,,"It can be hard to get a reservation at peak dine in hours but there were definitely open tables when we were there at early afternoon on a weekend. Service was great, the waiter knew we were ready to fast and kept coming back to check in on us"
,,,,,"Pork belly (10/10): *get this* Mindblowingly soft and tender, the ginger glaze was sweet and zesty which paired well"
,,,,,"Spanish Octopus (10/10): *get this* Best octopus I've ever had, not chewy or rubbery, your knife will cut straight through. "
,,,,,"Crispy Pig's Ear (8/10): This one was a bit underwhelming for me, there wasn't enough egg to really coat everything but I love crunchy foods so was still lovely"
,,,,,"Bone Marrow (9/10): Was definitely sad there was only one bone on the plate, the parsley and the sea salt go so well with the fattiness of the marrow - don't even get me started on the brea"
,,,,,Squid ink tagliatelle (8/10): Wasn't expecting pasta to be so good at a restaurant specializing in meat. The seafood flavor really stood out and the scallops were so tender
,,,,,"You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, would recommended 10/10. If you're coming to Chicago and are looking for a more elevated dining experience but not one that feels stuffy check it out!!"
,,,,,"Good food, cozy environment and friendly staff! I'd recommend coming here earlier to avoid the line or make a reservation. Open your eyes widely to find the door. It is a bit hidden lol. We waited for like 45 mins so one star off."
,,,,,"Our meal at The Purple Pig had some pretty high highs, as well as some moderate lows. "
,,,,,"We started off with the crispy pigs ears, which were amazing! This dish was very different than anything I'be had at other restaurants, and the kale and pickled banana peppers balanced out the crunchy and salty pigs ears perfectly. Texture, flavor, and creativity were all there in this dish. "
,,,,,"The seared cauliflower was also very tasty, and uniquely served with cornichon. It was a combo I wouldn't have thought of or expected to like, but after trying it I'd get this dish again. "
,,,,,"We had pretty high expectations after the first two dishes, but were a bit disappointed by the Spanish octopus. The octopus was over cooked and not very tender, and the potatoes were also a bit overcooked and not as crisp as I would have hoped. This is not a dish I would get again. "
,,,,,"The bone marrow was tasty, but pretty standard and not terribly exciting compared to bone marrows we've had at other restaurants. However, the bread was beautifully toasted and made for a great base for the bread. This dish was overall a tad salty, but relatively tasty. "
,,,,,"The pork chop had a great flavor and was cooked very nicely, but wasn't particularly interesting and not terribly unique. It was a tad salty and towards the end of the dish it was getting a bit hard to eat without continuously drinking water. Given the price point, I also wish it came with some sort of starch or veggie, as this was the last dish served and we didn't have anything else to eat with it. "
,,,,,"As a whole, we enjoyed our meal and were happy to have tried a variety of dishes. There were definitely some mixed feelings at the end with dishes we would get again, and others we'd avoid in the future, but an overall good ambiance and and enjoyable experience."
,,,,,"Why only 3 stars because I am comparing it to the time I was there over 3 years ago. When this place was located on the other side of the river, the ambiance was much darker, cozier and felt more like a chicago restaurant feel to it. Now it feels like a you are in the first floor of an office building, oh wait you are. The other place made you forget that and that made the place feel special. Now for the food.  bravo on the bone marrow and bread as I remember the last time I ate there. My kids could not get enough of the bread of how soft and full of flavor it had. As for the rest, mussels, Orecchiette, calamari and Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder all good but nothing great. Will I be back, not anytime soon. Would I recommend this place, I use too but not anymore as I would suggest a more special feel to the restaurant. Fyi...No more water view"
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Due to the touristy location I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this meal but I was. We ordered everything to be shared: raviollo, cauliflower, feta dip, and salmon.  I wasn't a fan of the cauliflower dish for more then a bite or two but everything else was delicious. The Raviollo dish was hands down the best thing I ate in 2021 and would consider a quick trip to Chicago just to eat that again."
,,,,,"If you like pork, then come on over! I have never been to a place that had so many pork dishes. The pork belly is a must try and maybe the best pork belly I've had at an American restaurant. The portions are pretty large and are meant to be shared. I went to lunch here alone to try out the pork belly and gnocchi and was not even close to finishing. FYI bread for the table is $1."
,,,,,"Grilled Spanish Octopus and Agnolotii with brown butter sauce lingers, ugh, wish this place was near! "
,,,,,"Simply great inventive and well-innovative prepared food! Every items we ordered were excellent especially the Spanish Octopus, Pork Belly & Bone Marrow!"
,,,,,"I want to try the rest of the menu before leaving Chicago, OMG, I will surely wish they have one in DC! I say no more..."
,,,,,Great food. Review of all the items we tried:
,,,,,"Salt roasted beets - very sweet, not exactly a dessert dish, but too sweet to be an entre. Still very good"
,,,,,Mushroom Agnolotti - good. Classic pasta dish
,,,,,Ravioletto - too much truffle. But if you like that then it's fine. This is the only entre I personally don't recommend
,,,,,"Braised Lamb Shank - no complaints, very good"
,,,,,"Chicken Thigh Kebabs - the potatoes weren't great, but the chicken itself was very good"
,,,,,"I've seen rave reviews about this place so I had to check it out! We came for lunch on a Saturday and were immediately seated, but had to go with bar seating since we didn't reserve ahead of time."
,,,,,"Bread for the Table ($6): bread was nothing special (it is assorted breads, though). Truffle butter was rich and tasty with a generous sprinkling of truffle. It was a little too salty but still very good. For $6 it's pretty worth it if you don't want to get a heavier appetizer"
,,,,,"Crispy Pig's Ear ($19): If you're grossed out by ears, it's okay. it's cut into small strips and fried, so you wouldn't even know what it's made of. basically tastes like anything else that's been fried. pretty good, but also too salty. I like the idea of the fried kale and pickled banana peppers, but the saltiness just wasn't doing it for me. This was way too expensive to be worth it."
,,,,,"Pork Belly ($23): One of their signature dishes, and it almost lived up to the hype. The pork belly itself was very good and tender. The outside crust was caramelized and the inside had a good balance of meat and fat. The sauce complemented it very well. The rest of the dish didn't balance out the flavor, though. The other things on the plate are supposed to provide contrast to the ultra-richness/fatness of the pork belly, but the pickled carrots were a little too overwhelming. I liked the addition of some greens and radishes, but it wasn't enough. For the most part, the dish is good... but my standards are a little higher because I've had really good pork belly at other restaurants already. Plus, this was expensive."
,,,,,"Squid Ink Tagliatelle ($22): Once again, this was good but not great. The pasta was so-so. The cherry tomatoes were pretty good, though. At this price point, you could get some pretty amazing pasta in Boston's North End... so... still overpriced."
,,,,,"Service was very average. The waiter seemed rushed and wasn't very helpful (I was between a 3 and a 4, but the service rounded it down to a 3). All of the food is GOOD, but had some sort of drawback that kept it from achieving its full potential. That plus being really pricey makes this place a 3."
,,,,,"You can't go wrong with dining here! From the last time I visited they moved location, not sure if it's any bigger. Food was pretty good, but my first time I thought it was better. Don't get me wrong it's still good and you must try it still! "
,,,,,We got these items to share: 
,,,,,-Tuna Tartare: a huge portion actually! Love the crunchiness of the wonton like cracker
,,,,,"-JLT: delicious!! A must order. Perfectly tender and full of flavors. This or the pork belly, can't go wrong! "
,,,,,"-Mushroon Agnolotti: my friends love this but it was not a favorite of mine. It was too sweet. I think it's the brown butter, but it was distractingly sweet with the mushroom. I may have also gotten the end pieces or maybe the brown sugar didn't burn off. Did not enjoy. "
,,,,,"-Orecchiette: although a very good dish with the sausage and the home made pasta shells, it was extremely salty! The broccoli itself was also super salty. I think there was a heavy hand on the salt... and we ended with the orecchiette, so we had salty mouth. "
,,,,,Cocktails are a must because they can make a really good damn cocktail. I love their whiskey sour. Delicious.
,,,,,"Another place in Chicago where the wait is long, so here's my tip: GO TO THE BAR and see if anyone is leaving or is on their last course/paying bills and wait nearby for them to leave and get in contact with the server who is taking orders for the bar- she will help you grab those seats after! When you only have a few days to spend in Chicago- time is important- we saved an hour of waiting by doing this! "
,,,,,Wonder why the wait is so long? Because the food is marvelous. Yes- everything we had was delicious and we enjoyed it better than the 3 star Michelin restro in the area...and we pay a fraction of the price! 
,,,,,"We sat at the end of the bar where all the food were coming out. We saw how chaotic the kitchen was, but a beautiful chaotic where they all worked in harmony to spit out great food in a matter of minutes. The young chefs also tried everything that came out to make sure taste is on point. It was like watching Hell's Kitchen but no yelling! We got the pork belly, roasted duck, octopus and a couple of drinks. The portion fit the price, so you won't be getting ripped off here or leaving hungry. The pork belly was nice and crispy and tender. Perfectly seasoned. The duck... good style of cooking duck- it was by no means dry at all. Plenty of meat and literally fell off the bone tender. I also LOVE the trout roe on the yogurt-like sauce...so good. And the last... octopus with green beans, potatoes and this lemon, basil oil- like a chimichurri, went so well with the charred octopus. "
,,,,,Definitely worth the wait...and I can see why people wait!
,,,,,"Restaurant is worth the hype. We ordered three dishes between two people and it was plenty of food - full but not uncomfortably full. We had the Grilled Broccoli, Squid Ink Tagliatelle, and Pork Shoulder. Every dish was fantastic! Highly recommend each of them. The pork shoulder was so tender and juicy that we didn't even need a knife to cut through."
,,,,,"Our waiter was friendly and fine, though I asked him what he'd recommend for an appetizer and he kind of rambled off a bunch of items without any enthusiasm. It was a little odd to me, like isn't there something on the menu you enjoy? Ah well, besides that he was friendly and attentive enough."
,,,,,"What an extravagant dining experience! Our friends made our reservation for a party of five. We visited on a Friday evening at the end of May. This place was busy, but we were very well taken care of. Our friend who made our reservations, also took charge of our dining plans. After drinks were decided, he suggested that we order multiple appetizers and entrées to share among all of us. When the food eventually arrived, it just kept coming and coming! LOL."
,,,,,"The first highlight of the evening for me, was the meat and cheese trays! They always feel fancy and you just can't go wrong! They totally delivered! But I'm pretty sure that basically everyone else was the most excited about the tuna tartare appetizer. I have to say that the presentation was quite exquisite! Although the bone marrow felt particularly fancy as well! It was served with thick slices of bread that were quite toasted and crispy on the outside, but very fluffy and light on the inside. It tasted delicious with the capers and cilantro provided!"
,,,,,"The main dishes were just as impressive. While I was initially drawn to the pork, I have to say that it was the duck that really won me over! It had a sweet and sticky skin. And it comes with buns so you can pull it off and make yourself a sandwich!"
,,,,,"For dessert, most of my crew went for an affogatto. But that's not my style. I tried their bread pudding with Tres leches ice cream. Man did it deliver! The ice cream was creamy and not overly sweet. But the bread pudding was just about the most moist I've ever had and was perfectly sweet and delicious! I wish I could have more right now!"
,,,,,I really enjoyed my artichokes with fingerling potatoes -- they were simply perfect with a light dressing atop.
,,,,,"The turkey leg confit also satisfied, and one of our friends we had dinner with here simply RAVED about the duck with trout roe that she ordered."
,,,,,GREAT service.
,,,,,Top drawer views of the water!
,,,,,"This is my very Hubble opinion, but I'm very torn. I love the food, but miss the atmosphere of the old place. However, The quality of Chef Bannos's menu has not waivered. I miss the communal and intimate feel of the old place. I enjoyed sharing a table with other patrons and having good conversations and I miss how cozy it was. That being said, I completely understand the need for progress and expansion to fill the demand for his food, and with COVID that definitely wouldn't be happening. The atmosphere now feels just like an everyday eatery. I'm happy to say that quality and flavor has not been sacrificed."
,,,,,"Food comes out as it is prepared. So if you want to pace your meal, order a little bit at time. The staff will not rush you. Noise level is quite loud and at times it's difficulty have a conversation."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,So happy I was able to enjoy the cuisine here! I made reservations 2 days prior and snagged the last spot at 4:15pm.
,,,,,"Everything we ordered on the menu was absolutely fabulous. We ordered the tuna tartare which was so good, and an absolute must try if you are coming here for the first time. Next, we ordered the meat and cheese board with 5 options. The selection was good, I only wish there were more of the crackers that came with the board. Third we had the bone marrow smear which wasn't the highlight of the meal, but definitely worth trying. Fourth we had this amazing freshly made pasta! We tried ordering the special that was on the menu, but since they sold out our server recommended her favorite instead, which looking back I don't believe was listed on the menu, it came with a browned butter sauce (see photos). Last we had the bread pudding for dessert which was the perfect end to dinner. We were told the cheesecake is their most popular, opted for the bread pudding because our meal consisted of a lot of cheese already. "
,,,,,"Highly recommend, and worth making a reservation for if you ever come to visit Chicago."
,,,,,What more can I say that hasn't already been said -- The Purple Pig is phenomenal! It lives up to the hype! The food is extraordinary. Mind blowing. Make your reservation NOW.
,,,,,"Luckily, we were able to be seated at the bar without a reservation (thank you)! And our server Eddy is a superstar. He was charming and recommended the best items on the menu. He even let us sample a new potato appetizer that wasn't on the menu yet! Love him."
,,,,,"The food & drinks -- the cocktails are boozy and beautiful. My type of cocktail! For the food, we split three plates: the potato appetizer (not sure of the name), the tuna tartare and the octopus. Sheesh, everything kept blowing my mind. The potatoes are garlicky and savory... the parmesan sauce elevated it to a whole different level. The tuna tartare... it tasted as pretty as it looks! The tuna was soft, delicate and fresh... and the homemade circular cracker... I would buy it by the pound if I could. It was buttery, flaky and tasty... super addicting. And the octopus, order it. I don't think I've had octopus this well prepared. This dish is in a league of its own. Pesto sauce? The chef is a genius. Everything was amazing. I can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,"For lovers of all things pork, PP should be on your list.  There are a few dishes without pork elements (tuna tartare looks like a standout, as we saw several tables order this appetizer), but even the salmon entree has pork on it!"
,,,,,"Our bubbly server was Josie (""as in Josie and the Pussycats"" she told us.  She explained that dishes are really meant to be shared amongst our group.  She recommended the broccoli, the pork belly, the beets with goat cheese and the cheese ravioli in a brown butter sauce.  All were solid choices - not life changing like Josie sold them as - but I would order all of them again.  The only thing we missed out on what the aforementioned tuna tartare.  But these four dishes were more than enough dinner for our group of four."
,,,,,"We also took Josie's recommendation on desserts with bread pudding and something called the ""iris"" which is an egg shaped fried dough with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips on the inside.  Both were excellent and would order again."
,,,,,"Finally, we enjoyed several of their signature cocktails:  a Four Roses boubon with lavendar and lemon, a smoked mezcal (sorry I don't know their names).  Most drinks are priced at $16, so a good price for a downtown restaurant."
,,,,,"Simply put, we can have this meal over and over again  There's no mystery as to why The Purple Pig is deserving of accolades and hype. Well worth your visit! Friendly and attentive staff + tasty food = happy bellies. There are no wrong choices when it comes to ordering from the menu. One item that unexpectedly stood out from among the rest: Mushroom 3 Ways (Grilled King Trumpets, Shiitake Au Jus, Pickled Onion + Truffle and Mushroom Puree) Can't wait until our next visit! "

,,,,,"Pictured: Roasted Bone Marrow (with Herbs, Capers, Onions and Flaky Sea Salt) , Tuna Tartare (also with truffle in their housemade cracker) , Mushroom 3 Ways , Squid Ink Tagliatelle (with Scallops, Shrimp, and the sweetest, umami-filled tomatoes we've ever known) , Pork Belly (in a Ginger glaze and Espresso sauce), Pear Tart (Wine Roasted Pears, Candied Pistachios, Espresso Mascarpone, and Vanilla Gelato) , and Strawberry Guava Sorbet"
,,,,,I had my doubts because the portion sizes looked small in photos / not that yummy but boy I was wrong! The pork shoulder is probably the most perfect and beautifully cooked piece of meat I have ever consumed. Still dreaming about it days later. The food was served piping hot which I loveeee.
,,,,,"Also, bread is not free. Don't fall for that trap! :')"
,,,,,"Love this place. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. We made reservations online and were seated right away. Came for a weekday lunch, and the service was pretty good. "
,,,,,"- Crispy pig's ears (5/5): very savory dish, a bit salty but still delicious. Kale was a great addition to the dish, with an added crunch. Banana peppers added a sour kick"
,,,,,- Pork liver and bacon pate (4/5): served with toasted buttery bread and grape mostarda (like a jam) which complimented the pate well. Pate was tasty and not too salty
,,,,,"- Pork belly- very tender and fatty, cooked very well. Loved the glaze on top of the pork belly"
,,,,,Heard good things about this restaurant so decided to give it a shot!
,,,,,Went during the weekend at the end of the lunch hour and was able to be seated right away without a reservation. Menu is accessed via QR code and was told by the waitress that the dishes were meant to be enjoyed family style. Dishes came out once they were ready in the kitchen. 
,,,,,"The special that day was sausage with black truffle and egg, all on top of an English muffin ($23). This dish actually came out first (aside from the glass of Babic Reserve), and it was definitely my FAVORITE dish I had here. The sausage and the black truffle were so flavorful, and the egg was nice and runny. The dish was brought out with a knife, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork rather than as a sandwich because it was a bit messy. "
,,,,,"The next dish was the Roasted Bone Marrow ($15). I've never had bone marrow like this before; the wait staff instructs you to spread it in the bread, sprinkle on some salt, and finally top it with the parsley and capers. The bone marrow is like a less attractive looking butter; nothing about this dish stood out. It would have been better if this dish came out first since it's more like an appetizer than the first dish. "
,,,,,"The last dish to come out was the Milk Braised Berkshire Shoulder ($25). On the menu, it was recommended that this dish be paired with the Babic Reserve ($19 for one glass), thus that was the cup of wine for the afternoon. The meat was very soft and tender; no knife required! Overall a very simple, homey dish. Nothing crazy, no surprises. The mashed potatoes were the thinner variety; although this is not an incorrect way to make the mashed potatoes, I personally prefer them to be a bit thicker. But to each their own. "
,,,,,"Service was great and paced well. Bathrooms were also clean. The portions were smaller than I expected for the price of the items, which is why I am only giving this restaurant four stars rather than five stars. However, it was still a very solid lunch!"
,,,,,"I went there with high expectations... Well, maybe my expectations were so high that I set myself up for disappointment... The food was good, but nowhere near great, or anything more impressive than an average semi-upscale tapa place."
,,,,,"The first dish served was the GRILLED CAULIFLOWER which was excellent, and it probably set my bar of expectations another notch higher from that point forward. The cauliflower was so perfectly cooked that it was soft enough but still maintained a crispy texture. A hint of lemon juice gave it a refreshing dimension. (5 stars)"
,,,,,"The BRAISED BERKSHIRE SHOULDER was one of their signature dishes and the meat was indeed richly flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender. One bite and I could tell it was high quality pork. Unfortunately, it was too salty and added a tad of disappointment to an otherwise perfect dish. (4 stars)"
,,,,,"Their MUSHROOM AGNOLOTTI would have been delicious if it were not overwhelmed by the strong lemon juice flavor. In contrast to the cauliflower, where a hint of lemon enhanced the veggie; here the lemon flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered the mushrooms, which should have been the centerpiece of the dish. (3 stars)"
,,,,,"Again, the SPANISH OCTOPUS was completely overwhelmed by the lemon flavor. Moreover, the texture of the octopus was a bit soft and mushy, and it was probably not fresh. (2 stars)"
,,,,,"The average star rating of the 4 dishes = 3.5. Until Yelp has a half-star rating system, I will round it up to 4 stars, to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just an unusual off day for the chefs."
,,,,,This was a great experience! 
,,,,,The Duck was divine and ricotta gnocchi was very good! Great meal on a cold winters night.
,,,,,"Wow, their food is just incredible. It's no wonder their seats are always filled and folks are always raving about the Purple Pig. Every single thing we had was knock-it-out-of-the-park delicious."
,,,,,"I came here on a weeknight for a double date and we started off with some drinks. I had the ""Last Word"" cocktail made with gin and my partner had the ""Blood and Sand."" If you like bourbon, the Blood and Sand cocktail is for you."
,,,,,Between 4 people we had:
,,,,,Whipped Feta
,,,,,"Meat & Cheese Plate (Selection of 5; camembert, manchego, proscuitto, lomo, pancetta)"
,,,,,Pork Belly
,,,,,"Ravioletto (truffle lovers, this is divine. It is bathed in brown butter)."
,,,,,Filet Mignon Special
,,,,,Sicilian Iris
,,,,,Lemon Tart
,,,,,"The amount of food we ordered was perfect. Our server sold us on their Filet Mignon special that evening, served on top of whipped purple potatoes, and we were sold. Unfortunately they were actually out of bone marrow that day - we were told their shipment arrived mid-afternoon and the timing was too tight to have them prepared.  We were actually talking up a storm about how great the marrow was, since our friends we were dining with just moved to Chicago and was excited about the food scene. Even without the highly anticipated bone marrow, everything was 10/10."
,,,,,"I usually need a little extra convincing if a place is extra ""touristy"" especially if it's in the heart of downtown. But... I cannot find anything bad to say.  They have thousands or reviews on Yelp, Google, and Trip Advisor and with this much clout, the data doesn't lie. I can only add to the chorus of people who are in love with this restaurant. It is mediterranean style and the dishes are meant to be shared, so order to your heart's content. Or, you can sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of wine with really good meat & cheese."
,,,,,"They are located right on the Magnificent Mile and beloved by locals and visitors. When I dined here about a decade ago, they were in a different building just next door which has turned into a Chick Fil-A.  Now the food is even better than I remember. It's definitely a spot that can be for a special occasion and the food will be a bit pricier, but well worth it. I'd add the Purple Pig to anyone's ""must try"" while in the city."
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,Great staff and easy to get in. The bone marrow is the best in ChIcago here. Highly recommend going here with a large group.
,,,,,"What can I say that hasn't already been stated about THE Purple Pig.  The meal was absolutely outstanding. We got lucky enough during the evening rush to walk in and grab two bar seats.  The bartenders were attentive and made us several outstanding cocktails.  The whole meal was outstanding, from the pork to the whipped feta (best I have had) but the beets.  I can't say enough about the beet dish which I only ordered because half the bar had them, so they had to be great. They were a perfect dish, and honestly, I could have just eaten that as my meal, but I had to share it with my business partner :(.  Great experience, and I certainly will be back next time I am in town."
,,,,,"We strategically made a reservation to dine here after a 2 hour Gangsters and Ghosts walking tour. Famished and exhausted, we snagged the last 2 bar spots instead of a booth - that way we were able to engage and interact with Chef Effy and drool over the dishes coming out of the hot box. Mauro was awesome in keeping us hydrated with my default refresher - lemon drop martini and my hubby's Jameson . We very much enjoyed the following:"
,,,,,  
,,,,,"Tuna Tartare ($24): ahi tuna, pistachio, truffle oil in the super tasty cutie pie crispy cracker basket "
,,,,,Squid Ink Tagliatelle ($22): so generous with the scallops and shrimps and pasta softish but not soggy 
,,,,,"Mushroom 3 Way ($15): grilled king trumpets, shiitake au jus, truffle and mushroom purée equals OMG"
,,,,,"Pork Belly ($23):  So tender, tasty, flavorful with crispy skin. Totally earned high praises from the Mister"
,,,,,Every dish is beautifully plated and more importantly we SAVORED every bite and almost licked the plates dry.  Not surprising that it is a James Beard awardee and a Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand recipient. Truly well-deserving of the accolades and 5-star reviews.  Thank you Chef Effy and Mauro for a delightful dinner!
,,,,,Made reservations on Tock via Chase Reserve Dining. Conveniently located in the fabulous Mag Mile on Michigan x Illinois.
,,,,,"I had really high expectations for this place. We tried the sardines, the cauliflower soup and the skewers. Every dish was well executed but not particularly special. For example I found that the chicken skewers had a lot of fat and the tzatziki sauce was very sour (actually, it was not really close to the traditional tzatziki)."
,,,,,This place is absolutely amazing!! We did not have a reservation but was able to find plenty of seat at the bar. In my opinion I really like to sit at the bar because I feel like the service is a lot faster and they have the full menu available as well. Everyone was very nice and the food and drinks came out in a timely manner. The food and drinks were absolutely amazing!! and the ambience was great!! I really recommend checking this place if you get the chance!
,,,,,"What is meant to be, will be, and the Purple Pig was meant to be! First we stopped by Friday night and the 45m wait was not conducive to our touristy artsy fartsy plans for the evening. How foolish of me not to realize this was THE place to dine, so no we did not not have resys or even the slightest idea of the wait time. However, as the stars would have it, we were able to walk in for an early dinner on Saturday and be seated right away."
,,,,,"The Purple Pig was a treat! My friend has more of a vegan friendly diet than my everything-but-the-kitchen-sink lifestyle, so it was nice to have options that weren't fried and appealed to both of us, since everything is meant to be shared. We had 4 vegetarian friendly dishes for 2 + 2 drinks each and left satisfied. "
,,,,,"Can I just say that the beets salad was to die for?! Wow, wow the pistachio butter was everything a girl needed and then some. At first I was under the impression I was having peanut butter or tahini so don't think it tastes like butter at all, because it does not. Something about the tanginess of the beets/feta just works perfectly.  "
,,,,,"Next up was the Mushrooms 3 ways which were equally amazing. The king oysters ofcourse were ""meaty"" and the shiitake au jus really made me forget there was no meat on my plate. Like really I could've devoured 4 servings in one sitting."
,,,,,"Finally the star was the Ricotta & Mushroom Agnolotti, but of course! The brown butter with the luxurious whipped filling was just *chefs kiss.* I definitely was left craving more. They were the perfect pockets of love."
,,,,,We also shared the hummus which came with quite a nice serving of focaccia. This was our starter and honestly it's easy to get full off the bread alone. 
,,,,,The drinks we got were the penicillin and the Paloma which were perfect compliments to our meal. 
,,,,,"Overall, I wish I lived in Chicago to visit this place more often, but 5/5 would recommend and visit on the next trip for meat options!"
,,,,,"Plates are meant to be shared, which is great because you get to try more dishes! We were able to get a seat at the bar without a reservation."
,,,,,"The sweet corn was simple and refreshing, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Pork secreto was surprisingly delicious - the meat was lean but tender and super flavorful. The pickled watermelon that came with it was a little overwhelming. The pork belly was cooked well and also very tender. For dessert, we got the fig tart which was paired with espresso mascarpone. It was definitely an interesting flavor combo but wasn't bad! Not too sweet, which I liked."
,,,,,"Lots of hype going into this, and it ended up being a pretty good lunch. The mussels were great (my favorite thing) - lots of yummy sauce and the bread added a nice crunch. The squid ink tagliatelle was pretty good - I really liked the slightly spicy sauce but the pasta itself was a little softer than I'd expected. Would've liked it just slightly more al dente. The osso bucco was a HUGE portion - so much meat! The meat was so tender and very very saucy (almost too saucy and salty?) and honestly needed something else to balance it out. Maybe a heftier grain (not the beans that came with There were a few thinly sliced pears that added a much needed crunch and some acidity but there were not enough of them! Still a good meal overall!"
,,,,,"We went to the Purple Pig to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant has been on our ""to try"" list for awhile. We were running a few minutes late because traffic on State Street was the worst I have ever seen. Luckily, I called the restaurant when I knew we weren't going to make it and let them know. They were very nice and said that it would be ok. We arrived to dinner about 20 minutes late and they sat us right away! They were very accommodating. Our waiter greeted us and he was fantastic as well. He was so knowledgeable about the menu and what to get. He told us we were getting a lot of food... but we knew that. We wanted to take some home. First, we ordered our drinks, I got the Kentucky Mule and the Prickely Punch. Both were very good, tasty and delicious. For our first dish, we ordered the Pork Liver and Bacon Pate. I have to say that is was one of my favorite things we ordered. The bread was toasted perfectly and the liver was super flavorful. You may be put off by the fact it is liver, but the texture and flavor were awesome. Next, we ordered the crispy pig ear. It was actually just glorified pork rinds. They were super salty and didn't taste great. Even if you break the egg on top perfectly, it doesn't cover the entire thing. While this was the most popular and recommended item, it was my least favorite. Then, we ordered the ricotta gnocchi. It was amazing! The texture was soft and pillowy. The sauce was a burst of flavor that just makes you feel warm and happy. The Milk braised Berkshire shoulder followed. It was very salty, but overall tasted good. The meat was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were rich and creamy. Finally, we ordered the half duck with orange and ginger glaze. This dish was HUGE. We saved half since it was so big. Keep that in mind if you make this one of your choices.... And you should. It was very good. The glaze was citrusy and delicious. The skin was crispy and flavorful. The duck meat was tender falling easily off the bone. I would definitely choose this as an option "
,,,,,"Overall, I liked my experience here. I thought the food was overall very good. However, it was way too salty. I was disappointed with the crispy pig ear, but had some other great options. It was very expensive for what we ordered, but we had a good time with great service."
,,,,,The Purple Pig made our trip enjoyable! 
,,,,,"We went for lunch the atmosphere it's lovely, menu options and plates are awesome and delicious. Each plate presentation it's gorgeous."
,,,,,The only thing that topped the food was our server. I'm not sure exactly what his name was but I believe it was Tai(Thai)!!  Excellent sense of humor and kept us entertained the entire time.  
,,,,,Overall I would come back and try some other options on the menu. The menu definitely had some other interesting item I would like to try.
,,,,,444 N Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60611"
,,,,,"Had high expectations Bc this place is super popular and well known in Chicago but I felt it was pretty underwhelming. We ordered the tuna tartare, broccoli and Berkshire shoulder. The tuna tartare was so pretty in presentation and it was delicious as well. The cracker/chip was super flaky and crispy at the same time and the tuna tartare was flavored very nicely. The other two dishes were pretty heavy and were mediocre in my opinion."
,,,,,I enjoyed this place .. it definitely has choice! 
,,,,,However I was told when we sat down to order that is was really almost like tapas style... hmm.. it was definitely to me more then tasting portions. Not usually a complaint because more is better.. right !  
,,,,,I found the food ok! Flavours were simple and I recommend trying it. I liked it my friend didn't so worth experiencing it for urself. 
,,,,,The price it reasonable but I would love to see I little lower price point on some items with less quantity so I can enjoy more of different options. It's a place u want to hang out for a while. 
,,,,,I definitely recommend going as a group and share. 
,,,,,The marrow was delish but it's a lot for two people.. tuna tartare was dead on .i loved the presentation.. 
,,,,,This is a place to share a meal and have a drink or two or three  ;) 
,,,,,Oh and service was friendly and explained everything..
,,,,,Dined in again on a Sunday afternoon. Place is full as usual but with high turnover no wait. 
,,,,,We ordered the ravioli special of the day. The smell was awkward but the taste was great. 
,,,,,Pappardelle - very well executed dish but nothing special taste wise. 
,,,,,Pork ribs - well executed. I love ribs in general so this dish was my favorite but otherwise not mindblowing. Would order again though. 
,,,,,Duck - took the longest to come out. I thought it was okay but the rest of my party thought it was subpar. 
,,,,,"After eating here 3 times now for tourist friends' sake, I can safely say that overall the meat dishes except the ribs are all too salty. The pasta dishes are the most balanced taste wise but some aren't too special. In the future I will stay away from the meats except the ribs."
,,,,,"Probably one of the most if not the most reviewed restaurant in Chicago. Dined in on a Monday evening. There was no wait, however a line started forming around 7 pm. "
,,,,,Food (7.5/10):
,,,,,I would like to rate higher. The quality and taste is excellent for every dish. The one caveat my table noticed was after a few bites of each dish you start to realize the food is a bit too salty and rich when trying to finish the entire dish. We ended up needing to keep refilling our waters and wish there was bread or something on the side. 
,,,,,Pork liver bacon pate: a great starter. The bread was way better than expected with a balanced crust to softness ratio.
,,,,,Squid ink tagliatelle: a rich seafood aroma when tasting that is perfect for seafood lovers. Comes with shrimp and scallops.
,,,,,Turkey leg confit: huge turkey leg that reminds you of Thanksgiving. The meat is tender and just falls off the bone. Amazing. Comes on a bed of caramelized sweet vegetables. The richness will catch up to you as you work through this dish.
,,,,,Milk braised Berkshire pork shoulder: not as tender as the turkey but cooked well nonetheless. The mashed potatoes are delicious. I wish there was more to balance out the pork shoulder which is rich as well towards the end.
,,,,,Value (7/10):
,,,,,Fair pricing for the quality. I'd expect to spend about $40 per person. I'd recommend parties of more than 2 to share and explore the menu more.
,,,,,Ambience/service (8/10): 
,,,,,Tucked indoors like a restaurant in the mall. Spacious with adequate spacing between tables. Service is attentive.
,,,,,Defn worth the special occasion 
,,,,,Visiting from New York. Would come back for this!
,,,,,Must have:
,,,,,Tuna tartare 
,,,,,Pear dessert 
,,,,,Octopus was delicious but on the softer side (not enough bounce)
,,,,,Definitely going back. 
,,,,,Stopped by for drinks and had a dinner reservation elsewhere. Will be going back for a meal soon. Service was impeccable! Servers knew exactly how the meals are prepared and were very knowledgeable and attentive.
,,,,,"Beautiful restaurant, decoration and service on point, but food was unbelievable. Everything is to share, portions are great... FLAVORS ARE AMAZING. We love it and next time visiting Chicago will go again!"
,,,,,"After weeks of not being able to find a reservation, I finally made it to The Purple Pig!! Their drinks were excellent (I ordered a mezcal cocktail and my friend ordered the French 75) and the food was spectacular although certain dishes definitely stood out more than others. "
,,,,,"If nothing else, you should definitely order the pork ribs. We chose this dish at the recommendation of our waiter and it was perfectly done - fall off the bone, crispy glazed top, great balance of flavors and textures in this dish."
,,,,,"We also ordered the octopus and beets. Any combination of beets and goat cheese will get a round of applause from me and the pistachio butter was a very nice touch. However, after a couple bites I was kind of sick of eating this dish. Would be great to share between a party of 4 or so."
,,,,,"The octopus was cooked beautifully - genuinely probably the first time I've had octopus where they nailed the texture. However, I did think it was a bit heavy on the dressing as it was very salty and tart."
,,,,,"Overall, had a great experience at The Purple Pig. Can't wait to come back to try some more dishes!"
,,,,,Literally AMAZING! Hands down my favorite restaurant we ate at during our trip to Chicago. Be sure to call and get your name on the waitlist if you're unable to get a reservation. We got the octopus & the turkey leg.
,,,,,"The octopus was so tender and I loved that it came on a bed of potatoes and green beans in a herb-y sauce. The turkey leg was tender, but it reminded me of a turkey leg at Disneyland. Honestly, didn't care for it much and wouldn't order again."
,,,,,"For being on magnificent miles, the portion sizes were huge and entree prices were fair."
,,,,,I can't wait to come back and eat here again next time I'm in the city!
,,,,,"SOO GOOD! Now I understand the hype around this place! My partner had been to their previous location and wanted to try their new one. He got us a reservation a few weeks in advance for Sunday brunch. We were seated right away when we arrived, and the place seemed quite packed and lively."
,,,,,What we got:
,,,,,"- roasted bone marrow (herbs, capers, onions, Maldom sea salt): comes with crostini to top with the bone marrow. This is a must-get, especially for small parties (it's the perfect portion size for two - you can't have too much of it in one sitting, but it's also SUPER delicious.)"
,,,,,"- ricotta & mushroom agnolotti (brown butter, aged balsamic & parmesan): We got this based on a friend's suggestion. It's pasta wrapped around mushroom, comes in 4 pieces. Very rich in taste. We enjoyed it, but the taste is so rich that we could just have 3 pieces."
,,,,,"- poached pork belly & lobster (special item): I'm so glad we caught this on the menu, as this was one of my favorite dishes here. The pork was SO GOOD though. The skin is caramalized into a thick, crispy layer. Sweet and such a good crunch factor. And the pork belly was so soft and juicy! Went well with the big lobster pieces on top! Beautiful presentation, as well!"
,,,,,"- half duck (Greek yogurt, smoked trout roe, brioche buns): loooove! We were afraid we'd over-ordered, but honestly we have large appetites so no big deal. The skin was nice and crispy, and the duck gaminess was mellowed out by the yogurt. Such a nice and unique combo!"
,,,,,"- prickly punch (Sombra mezcal, vermouth, lemon, rosemary and prickly pear): loooved this cute little drink! a little on the sweeter side, but enjoyed it!"
,,,,,"We had excellent service here from beginning to end. Our food came out in a very timely manner, coursed out from the bone marrow and mushroom pasta to the two entrees. All with good spacing between each. And they were very attentive in switching out plates and utensils after each course. "
,,,,,Would love to visit again!
,,,,,I want to have a date with my girl. So I made a reservation for this place. This place was perfect for some romantic date. The place looks elegant. The light was pretty nice because of the chandelier. It's better to go and eat your dinner here. When we came here my girl was impressed by how good this place is. There are some people inside. The only problem you will encounter here is the price of their dish. And also the small amount of their serving of their foods on plate. They have nice and perfect plating. Their customer service was good. The staff and waiter assisted you well. And they help you with everything you need. I'm glad that I chose this restaurant.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,"Ahh This place is so good! The buttery crust is a must when you go. We had the cheese bread (GET IT) pizza and I tried my little babe's ravioli and that was so so yummy too! I definitely prefer Giordano's over this place pizza wise, but we wanted to try multiple places for Chicago pizza and this is my 2nd favorite forever!  "
,,,,,"A caution on service though. We went for lunch and our server just completely forgot to put in half of our food. So everything came with the pizza (apps, salad, kids fruit) which was 45 minutes later "
,,,,,Overall 4/5!
,,,,,Some of the best Chicago style pizza I've had. I tried the bbq chicken personal pan and bruschetta to start. The bruschetta was fantastic paired perfect with the pizza and had a Windy City sour to wash it all down with. Highly recommend this place over eating at the typical large chain pizzerias.
,,,,,Did lots of research to find the best pizza place in Chicago and many said this place. And I knew I was there when the line of people were waiting outside and even more people were inside.  There was an hour wait once I finally got inside and put my name down. 
,,,,,"They did have free pizza made and sitting on the counter for those who were waiting which is a nice touch.  They were also allowing people to pre order which is a good option. While I don't know how much longer it would have been if I didn't pre order, it's still better than waiting and hour for a table then ordering. "
,,,,,Got the deep dish option with the famous butter crust and a thin crust personal pizza. 
,,,,,"Th thin crust option was pretty good. It's crispier and more like a cornmeal crust which is different. The toppings I had were chicken sausage, mushroom, and the spinach mix which has garlic and onion in it. So good. "
,,,,,I know people like deep dish but I sure don't so I was very pleased with the thin crust option. 
,,,,,Only con is I wish the small was smaller honestly. It's meant for two people vs one like the menu said. 
,,,,,Worth a stop seeing as the whole town is there lol
,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Danielle! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your thin crust pizza and had a great experience with us. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,Best deep dish pizza in Chicago? I haven't tried them all but I think I'm convinced. The butter crust matched with the pizza is truly quite a combination!
,,,,,"The calamari fritti is a must! Unexpectedly it was a little spicy, I got this for our children but they couldn't enjoy it"
,,,,,"The stuffed spinach bread with the crusty loaf we got as it was frequently recommended. It was good, nice crust but spectacular? Not really. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere at d second floor seems spacious and modern. The downstairs where we were felt dark, old n moody... But one could call it traditional I guess. "
,,,,,"Verdict: it would be gluttony to have this regularly, but when friend come over, this is d place to go!"
,,,,,"Thank you for writing a review, Simon! I am happy to hear you had a great experience and enjoyed our food. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,"Cheers,"

,,,,,OMG.. best Chicago deep dish pizza ever! I've tried a lot of deep dish in the Bay Area and I can see the imitation Chicago deep dish in the Bay Area can not compare to the actual Chicago pizza. Now let's describe this piece of heaven. 
,,,,,First is the crust. The crust isn't your regular chewy dough. It's a thin crispy buttery crust. They first layer it in really good mozzarella cheese than the sausage. Now the sausage isn't your typical little round balls of sausage that most pizza place use. It's a diff type of sausage. It's actually a whole giant pizza size patty sausage that they layer it on top of the cheese. So there's sausage with every bit you take. The sausage isn't salty like most sausage we use here.  It's so much better than that. 
,,,,,Next the last layer which is ripen whole tomatoes made into a nice chunky sauces. Most deep dish I've tried is usually tangy but this was perfect. Not sweet not too tangy. It's the perfect pizza sauce from heaven. Combine those four and you get the perfect best Chicago pizza ever! The bonus part is that I microwaved it the next day and it is still as good with the crust staying crispy. 
,,,,,So my final input is ...there is such things as a happy place.  I think I came pretty close in moving here for their pizza. Lol.
,,,,,"I waited 11/2 hours for this pizza to be delivered to my hotel .... let me just say I wasn't impressed. The pizza was soggy , the dough looked like it was done cooking. Based on my personal experience I would say the hype is a bit too much !"
,,,,,"Gordiano's have a thicker body with more cheese, which a lot of my friends like better. I personally like Lou because it's the right proportion of crust, meat, and sauce. It's almost like eating a burger on a pizza (if you order the sausage, that is). They have good vegetarian options, too. "
,,,,,Do try the ice cream/ cookie dessert too if you have a chance.
,,,,,Well Lou beats out Gino in my opinion 
,,,,,Don't like Gino's crust
,,,,,Anyway 35 minute wait turned out to be 5
,,,,,Ordered ahead but had to wait lol
,,,,,Minnestrone was lukewarm
,,,,,I think they left off the pepperoni from my
,,,,,Pizza 
,,,,,And charged me for it
,,,,,Anyway pizza was still pretty damn good
,,,,,"Tried the ""Lou"" style deep dish pizza . Lots of cheese and veggies and was well worth the 45 mins wait time. I was pretty hungry so I ordered the ""small"" size for 2 and was able to finish it on my own . A little on the pricy side when considering this is a pizza for one but the quality was good"
,,,,,Best deep dish ever. Hands down. You've got to go with the Chicago classic of sausage & butter crust (even if you're not a huge sausage fan). I was never into sausage on pizza (or otherwise) until I tried it here!! 
,,,,,**Don't ever skimp out on the butter crust. Best $0.75 you'll ever spend.

,,,,,"The Lous on Higgins and Wells are the best. Maybe it is the cheeze baked into the oven walls? Who knows - but it always warrants a stop when I'm staying downtown for a trade show at McCormick Place. Straightforward working man's deep dish, unlike those that start with G that have gone a little too froofy and upscale with the works."
,,,,,Personally not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but this is the spot I take people when I have guests in town and they always love it. This place seems to be the Chicago local favorite spot. They also have good thin crust of you are not a fan of the deep dish.
,,,,,Lou has never let me down in my entire life. Reviews that say otherwise are likely bc someone didn't know what to expect with deep dish.
,,,,,The best Chicago deep dish style pizza I've ever had!! We ordered the signature Deep dish Pizza Large good for 3-4 people as they advertised. But i think even a 5 people would still feel full ordering the large one. We opt for a to go as our hotel is close.
,,,,,My heart is happy. Portions are large staff is great. My first Chicago style pizza experience went off without flaws. Lou's is SO good. Picture to prove.
,,,,,"WOW, Waited an hour only to be rushed through our dinner. The pizza was ok, typically deep dish. To be honest, I had better deep dish at Pizza Hut. The wings average, they were served room temp, with ""Barbalou"" bbq sauce poured over the wings just before they were served. "
,,,,,"Ordered salad, ummm It was salad. "
,,,,,"Not much on the upshot, for lou's average over-hyped chicago deep dish with an overly rushing waitstaff. "
,,,,,"Waste of time and money. Not impressed given the length of the wait, stupid preorder crap, and then being rushed out the fing door."
,,,,,"So..... how to say, what to say.   The best deep dish pizza I have ever had.  Me and my wife tried 2 different ones and the classic Chicago deep dish was the best pizza I ever ate.  The reason I give this place a 4 is solely because of the alcoholic drinks they have.  In my opinion only the price was extremely expansive for the quality of drink provided.  And to finish off the review we had an appetizer called the trio is also expansive but the quality is great! I loved it and could just lick the plate where the dip came.  The food and the atmosphere is perfect.  Also a heads up the pizza is made from scratch or to order, so it does take a wHile to cook, totally do not mind since is so good, makes it worth the wait."
,,,,,hmm was a little disappointed but probably just personal preference...
,,,,,"As a new yorker visiting chicago, I was actually very excited to once again try deep dish."
,,,,,"my friend and I shared the MALNATI CHICAGO CLASSIC and the ""LOU""."
,,,,,The Lou was just too soggy due to the too many veggies I think. The Chicago Classic was much better and enjoyable but I was still underwhelmed as the pizza crust was just not crispy enough.
,,,,,I'm sure lots of chicago natives vote Lou's as there favorite for deep dish but mine fave is elsewhere...

Our wait time to sit was about 35 min and our wait time for the pizza was about 55 min over the original wait time (ordered about 10 min after we got in queue), so this wait better be worth it! Service is definitely not at par and overall wasn't impressed. The pizza was pretty good, but that's it. After we finished our pizza, I asked for the half eaten only large pie to go and the one slice from the other pizza thrown away. Waitress comes back with a check and the one pizza slice in a box. I asked her she misunderstood and said - sorry sir we already threw it out. Well, she didn't provide compensation for her error. I was unhappy when she said - sorry can't do anything for ya. A man with a love for cold pizza gets told - sorry we threw your pizza away - a pizza that I waited just under two hours to get. The one star is for the pizza because it was fantastic, but everything else is a 0."

,,,,,I was in Chicago for a night on business and came here with co-workers. They all were saying that Lou Malnati's is better than Giordano's. I personally like Giordano's more as my last visit to Lou Malnati's wasn't great.
,,,,, 
,,,,,"As I was told that they don't take a reservation, we came here around 4:30pm and sat at the bar until other folks arrived. "
,,,,,"We told the staff that we wanted to have a table at 5pm, and they were able to accommodate our request."
,,,,,The staff called us and took us to the table where was on the second floor. 
,,,,,"We first started off appetizers: Malnati salad, mozzarella stick, buffalo wings, and calamari. Malnati salad was very delicious! It wasn't too heavy, so I could eat it all. Salad dressing was perfectly matches to the salad. Loved it.  Mozzarella stick was okay. Nothing special. I didn't eat wings or calamari. "
,,,,,"For pizza, we ordered Large The Malnati Chicago Classic and The ""Lou"" with pepperoni. We ordered right after we ordered appetizer, so our pizza came a little after we finished our appetizers. "
,,,,,"The Lou which I had last time wasn't great, but I had with crustless and personal size, so I was hoping this time was better, but no. It was the same. I didn't like it. On the other hand, The Malnati Chicago Classis tasted good which was good surprise. I wish I knew that at the first time. It had chunk of tomatoes and very flavorful. "
,,,,,"When we were leaving, there were so many groups waiting to be seated. I'm glad we came here early enough, so we didn't have to wait!"
,,,,,"The staff was nice, and the service was good. I'm not a big fan of pizza, but Chicago pizza is better than regular pizza personally. I may come back if others want to come."
,,,,,"TIP #1: on weekends (fri-sun), go before noon to avoid any waiting (your food will still take the 30-45 mins tho)!"
,,,,,TIP #2: sign up for their email/newsletter and get a free app as a welcome!! Saves you around $10 and an app and a medium pizza should be plenty (and more) for three people! Oh you have two weeks to use it tho!!
,,,,,"Reviewing just the food, we ordered the trio of dips and pizza chips (app) and a medium half old, half new deep dish (Malnati's and Lou's). The trio dip was actually really good- pizza chips were coated in a tomato, buttery spread and the roasted garlic dip was delicious! The artichoke dip was way too buttery (?) or oily for me."
,,,,,"The deep dish itself was beautiful. The Malnati's is basically a thick layer of mozz cheese, an equally thick sausage layer, and tomato sauce. The sausage is flavorful and the tomato sauce was chunky! The Lou's is perfect if you like a more vegetarian option- lots of spinach at the base, then mushrooms, sliced tomatoes, mozz, and cheddar. I liked the amount of toppings in both BUT they were way too cheesy for me. It was my first time having deep dish so it might be typical, but I'd be wary if you also don't like cheese. Lastly, the crust had a good crunch! "
,,,,,"LM's is a great place to try at least once, with nice servers, restaurant space, and tasty and original pizza, but I personally don't need deep dish anytime soon in my life (sorry!)"
,,,,,I've been to Lou's twice now and both times have been great.
,,,,,I recommend this business to family and friends.
,,,,,"If I'm in Chicago and looking for some authentic deep dish this is generally where I end up. The pizza is really good, it's conveniently located downtown and there are several locations too!"
,,,,,"I've had deep dish at 3 different places that were all recommended by different people I know who grew up in Chicago. If my experience at these different places taught me anything, it's that Lou's serves some legit pizza."
,,,,,Something I feel I should mention is that these pizzas are a lot of food. So far I have never been able to finish one in a single sitting. I'm okay with that because it's just more for later!
,,,,,I have ended up here every time I have been to Chicago and will keep coming back!
,,,,,"Was recommended by a few different friends who had been, or lived in Chicago, where they go for deep dish. Thank you Zza Gods for aligning me with this place. Everything from the salad, wings, and the main event, that incredible deep dish, were above what I expected. Skipped out on lunch just to have enough room for all the food here and it was still too much food! Will definitely be back."
,,,,,"Worth the wait! It was about two hours from the time we put our names down to when we got our pizza, but every bite made up for it. The place was absolutely packed, so I was thankful that we could pre-order our pizza and simply get a text when our table was ready. That actually gave us time to do more sightseeing along the river while we waited, which was nice! "
,,,,,"The ""Chicago Classic"" is the best deep dish I've ever had. From now on, Lou Malnati's is a Chicago-must-have every time I'm here."
,,,,,"Ok...talking to Chicago locals, many couldn't recommend a good deep dish pizzeria. One person said to go to Lou's and we're so glad we did! Here's the scoop: you go in and FIRST put your name in for a table. Then, you go order your pizza  so it's ready when your table is ready. The system works brilliantly. We ordered a salad, which was great! Then came the deep dish! We got The Lou and added sausage.  It was delicious! Expect a deep dish (lol), with a crust that's almost like pastry crust, but not sweet. It perfectly soaked up the juices from the sauce and the meat. The sangria was quite good, as well. Don't let a local steer you away from trying a deep dish. This was a great experience!!"
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's is now my favorite deep dish pizza place. I used to think it was Gino's East, but I was so wrong. We came to Lou's on a Friday afternoon and sat outside on their patio. My husband and I both had drinks and ended up splitting one of Lou's pepperoni deep dish pizzas and a ceasar salad. The combo was perfect and it was just the right amount of food portions for each of us. "
,,,,,"#1 reason why I love Lou's versus Gino's? The crust. Lou's crust is cooked perfectly, unlike Gino's that takes away the flavor of the pizza with their cornbread style crust. The pizza is also extremely flavorful and the service there is great. Plus, they have more than one location in Chicago, which I love. "
,,,,,"If you want real, authentic, delicious deep dish pizza, go to Lou Malnati's!"
,,,,,I had to put salt on my pizza. 
,,,,,The service was impressive-- they CHURN people in and out of here. I found the food to be extremely bland and disappointing.
,,,,,"Had this place at 4 starts for the deep-dish because I really enjoyed it.  It was some of the best deep dish I've had here in Chicago.  Went back to try the thin crust and that's where the 3 stars comes in.  The thin crust was disappointing, the crust tasted like it was just heated up frozen pizza and the pizza itself feel apart.  Overall, get the deep dish and avoid the thin crust"
,,,,,"My favorite. The first time I had it, I went into the restaurant and ordered and waited the typical 45 minutes or so. Totally worth it."
,,,,,"However, being the impatient person that I am, I appreciate the fact that they offer delivery of personal sizes with customizations so I can eat this alone in the comfort of my hotel room."
,,,,,I have had Pequod's and found it comparable. The number of locations and convenience of Lou Malnati's is why it gets 5 stars and is my go-to when I visit Chicago.

The salad was normal.., and the pizza was thinner than I expected in that the crust was still pretty tall but the toppings seemed less than other deep dish pizzas. I really enjoy the sausage that they put on the pizza. Absolutely delicious! And the customer service here was amazing. "
,,,,,"In summary, normal pizza, phenomenal sausage, and great customer service."
,,,,,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of deep dish, so my review is going to be at least slightly biased. This place gets extremely packed, so do not go if you are hungry already. They allowed us to put our name down and call/text us when our table was ready so we could go to a bar nearby to wait. We got summoned back to the restaurant, and we had to wait an additional half an hour after we got back, because they said there was a mix up with our table not actually being ready (we think they gave our table away). After we were seated we ordered some beers, calamari and pasta. Everything was had was pretty good, no complaints on the food. Although I'm not a deep dish fan, I did enjoy the pizza here. Overall I had a decent experience and I'm glad to have tried this place after so many high recommendations. I think the one visit has satisfied my curiosity."
,,,,,"My first deep dish experience wasn't great, I didn't eat at Lou Malnati's and now wish i had. The 40min wait went by quick with the ability to grab some drinks and enjoy a nice evening outside on the sidewalk. We elected to not pre order our pies as suggested, and figured we could enjoy some more drinks while we waited after we sat down and ordered. All 3 of us got a small pie (feeds 2 according to the menu). All were very tasty and renewed my faith in deep dish pizza. Definitely took some back the hotel. We asked to split the bill and the server was even able to split the appetizer 3 ways which was massively convenient to us. Overall a very pleasant experience, recommended if you have the time and patience to wait. We had both, would definitely come back."
,,,,,Originally I'm not a fan of Chicago deep dish pizza but this place is really good. My wife and I tried it while traveling to Chicago. It was amazing
,,,,,"We were recommended Lou's in our obligatory deep dish search and it did not disappoint! We started off with the bruschetta which was awesome!!!! Perfect toast - not too hard that the crunch makes everything fall off. It was a cross with a garlic bread bottom in a sense, but all freshly made and definitely recommend. Got the butter crust deep dish cheese. It's a 45 minute wait, but after reading all the other reviews and the bruschetta, we knew it would be worth the trip. It was quite good, but don't have anything to compare it to."
,,,,,"So...I really always thought of myself as a devout lover of NY style pizza that could never love Chicago style pizza as much. Well, I have never had Chicago style pizza before. And that is because I have never been to Chicago and never trusted anything deemed ""Chicago style pizza."" After extensive research and gaining approval from some locals, my husband and I settled on Lou's. We were not sure how much pizza to order because we can typically devour a large thin crust pizza. So we figured 2 smalls would allow us to indulge while having the chance to get a couple different kinds. We opted for plain cheese deep dish and the Malnati classic pie. The classic was by far our favorite but the cheese was so good as well."
,,,,,"In the end, we did not finish the two smalls but we came pretty damn close. The result was us being extremely full until bedtime that evening (lol!) It was definitely all that cheese! It was layer upon layer of thick, warm, gooey cheese and I do not regret one bite regardless of how large my food baby was. "
,,,,,"The service was quick, friendly, attentive, and honest. I say honest because they tell you that the pizza will take about 45 mins to cook (if you're ordering deep dish...and I don't know how you couldn't!) So, take that 45 minutes to drink a couple beers and build up the anticipation of great pizza to come. "
,,,,,"I loved everything about that pizza. So thick and unlike any pizza I've ever tried before. I am so sad that I've waited so long to try this style pizza but I am so glad it was at a place that clearly is doing something right. To make it clear, I am no expert on Chicago pizza but I am certainly an expert on pizza in general...and by expert I mean I eat a lot of pizza. Hehe. "
,,,,,"So if you're a newbie like me, give it a try and you will be surprised at how much you could love something you were so unsure of. I hope to try more Chicago-style pizza in the future and at least I will have a really great place to compare it to."
,,,,,PIZZA TIIIIIME!!! This was my first visit to Chicago so I'm no expert but this was the best Chicago style pizza I've ever had.
,,,,,"They've got their service down to a science to expedite your order and I appreciate that.  It's take about an hour for them to bake up the hottest pies north of the river.  So to minimize wait time they have you place your order while you're waiting for a table.  It was a 15-20 min wait for a table on Friday evening, not too bad. Once seated we we're served drianks ans appetizers/salad.  Shortly after our pizza came out. It was seamless.  You can tell they've been doing this for awhile, expertly executed. "
,,,,,"First up was the Malnati salad.  It was much more satisfying than your typical pizzeria salad.  There was these crispy bits of salami, mushrooms, diced tomatoes and a light vinaigrette dressing. "
,,,,,"We went with Stuffed spinach bread for our appetizer.  Even though  it took up space and left less room for pizza, this is a must order item.  The crust was covered in garlic butter and a sprinkle of Parmesan and the inside was loaded with gooey cheeses. "

,,,,,THE PIZZA
,,,,,"Malnati Chicago classic was  made with sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust.    I was expecting sausage crumbles but here was actually a layer of sausage. Very tasty and not too greasy surprisingly. "
,,,,,"""The Lou"" add pepperoni was bursting with flavors from the Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust PLUS I added those pepperonis.  This one was my favorite of the two.  Added just a bit of roughage in to break up the brick of cheese I was eating. "
,,,,,I must say that Chicago style pizza is not my favorite style but they executed it well and for that they must be commended.  Great work guys.  Your pizza and service is awesome!
,,,,,This place gets packed and for good reason.
,,,,,"On our last night in Chicago, a group of us decided we wanted some deep dish to close out our trip. This place was highly recommended, and by the look of the crowds waiting to get in, was popular among the locals as well."
,,,,,"One thing that's really awesome about this place is that they let you pre-order your pizza (because they take up to 50-minutes to cook) so that it's ready to be set at the table when it's finally your turn snag some seats. With our group of five on a Thursday night, it was a 45-minute wait even around 8PM, so we enjoyed each others company while grabbing a few drinks at their bar."
,,,,,"What I liked is that within a few minutes of being seated, pizza magically made its way to the tables and we were ready to eat. We got two medium sausage and pepperoni pizzas to share as well as a salad to break up the gluttonous amount of cheese we were about to indulge in. The salad was a great starter and that pizza was nothing to scoff at. The crust was super buttery and they didn't skimp on the meaty toppings."
,,,,,"Two pieces are enough for most, but because I was starving, I went for three. I felt like I was pregnant for the rest of the night, but didn't regret any of the bites I had to force myself to take."

,,,,,"I personally liked the pizza more than pequods because it wasn't as greasy, and the meat was spread more evenly throughout the pizza. It doesn't have that burnt crispiness that pequods had, but that's based on your preference.

,,,,,"My main issue is that we waited almost an hour during non-prime hours (3pm) only to receive a pizza that was cold.  Why were we waiting so long and starving when our pizza had clearly been sitting out and cooling off for quite a while? With all the cheese in this pizza, there was simply no way to really enjoy it at the temperature where the cheese has formed back into a solid hunk.  "
,,,,,"There were definitely service issues in this location as one waiter tried to drop off food that wasn't ours, and then our bill at the end reflected chicken wings (an order for only $9.99) instead of our pizza and drinks.  We were tempted to just pay the bill we received after the cold food and bad service, but moral values won out and we called the waitress's attention to it.  "

,,,,,"Ugh. I knew going in that I prefer NYC style pizzas (also true Italian pizzas!). However, I've heard SO MUCH about Lou Malnati's deep dish pizza that I decided I would keep an open mind. What a terrible experience!"
,,,,,"I came here alone, and I was told that they don't seat singles. So I decided to order take-out, which apparently takes THIRTY minutes. So I decided to walk around downtown and come back half an hour later, and lo and behold they went to the kitchen to ""check on it."" My thoughts? They want to remain exclusive so they tell me thirty minutes and make it in the ten minutes when I came back to ask about it. Not only that, the classic Lou's was... not good. It was like eating a very disappointing pie. There was a soggy bottom, and the cheese in a quarter of the pizza was quite enough for the ENTIRE pizza. Phew! What a waste of my time. I would recommend that you come here if you like deep dish pizza, but if you're from NYC or Italy just STAY AWAY!"

I skipped lunch after all for this.  She said it would be 40 minutes, but it was out in 30... they neatly serve up the first slice and off you go.  As advertised and expected --- nice thick, almost chunky tomato sauce, plenty of cheese and generous sausage.  They really promote ordering it ""your way"" which is a nice touch --- less sausage, more cheese, etc. "
,,,,,"Lauren kept my drink full and boxed up my last slice for a snack preflight. Give Lou's a try... I have had 'em all, and Lou's deep dish and even their thin crust is a good pie."

,,,,,"First time trying deep dish pizza in Chicago and I am so glad that we chose this place, because it was not only highly rated, but it was also one of the closest places to us."
,,,,,"Went for the classic, smallest size (because we literally just came here just to try deep dish pizza) and I was not disappointed. We ate the whole thing, including all of the butter crust. I also liked that you could customize the pizza to your preferences."
,,,,,"There is generally a wait, but definitely worth trying at least once."

,,,,,"A zillion years ago, I was a server.  And I still have bad flashbacks of parents feigning obliviousness as they let their angelic little moppets rip up sugar and cracker packets on the table. Or of desperately trying to be perky when I woke up feeling like I hated the world.  This is all to say that I have a huge amount of empathy when it comes to wait service issues.  But what we encountered here, definitely pushed that tolerance to the limit:"
,,,,,"Long story short, hubby, kid and I knew going in we'd need to wait around 45 minutes for our pizza.  But then an hour went by.  Then 15 more minutes, and still, no food.  We finally flagged down our server who mumbled something about the kitchen being backed up.  Another 20 minutes or so and we'd pretty much had it.  Hubby insisted we speak to a manager who finally got to the bottom of things.  Our server apparently had forgotten to put in our order.  Then when she finally remembered, she dropped our finished pies on the floor. She neglected to share any of this and kept trying fake us out."
,,,,,"In the end, it took TWO HOURS for our order to arrive.  The manager comped our meal, offering us an app and dessert, too.  We took her up on the former.  We were hangry by then!  "
,,,,,"In spite of the torturous wait, I cannot deny that I dug the pizza.  We got one with cheese and jalapenos, plus the Chicago Classic with Sausage.  The latter, in particular, was delicious.  For the three of us, we shared two smalls and still had leftovers."
,,,,,"Bottom line:  Ultimately, the manager redeemed the situation and the deep dish was good.  So four stars it is."
,,,,,"Was in town for the Chicago Marathon and of course, had to do all of the touristy things. Wanted a Chicago deep dish as part of my pre-race training. Spent many weeks reading all of the reviews of Lou's, Giordano's , Pequod's, etc. Also talked to many Chicagoans who all weighed in on their favorites. Took a shot a Lou's and wasn't  disappointed to say the least. We arrived on a Thursday night at the N. Wells location and put our name on the list. We were told it would take about an hour or so until we were seated. We were told that we could pre-order our pizza selections while we were waiting (which we did). About an hour later we were seated upstairs. It was close to 9pm, and Lou's was still packed. Service was attentive and we quickly had our drinks; followed soon thereafter by our pizzas. The pizzas were soo good! Many previous reviewers have talked about the butter crust on the pies- and they weren't wrong! Loved our experience at Lou's and will be my go-to pizza next time I'm in Chicago."
,,,,,"Best pizza in Chicago and best service . Thanks to Craig, manager on wells street for making my experience the best. Hands down beats every completion in Chicago. "
,,,,,"I'm a New York pizza lover but this place stole my heart. With waiting an hour or so, every second matter and I can't thank the amazing staff for all their great service. This is key to any business ."
,,,,,Ohhhh that buttery crust... lord
,,,,,Check out my last post on Giordano's..... very disappointed :(
,,,,,"The ambience, the decor, the great service, and the deep dish pizza was excellent. Wait time sucks. Also my waitress didn't get our order down properly, but it was great food and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,,,,"I'd come back here again but would make sure to have waitress read back our order just to be on the SAME page, would give it 3 stars tbh because waitress messed up our order(we were supposed to get two small dishes but instead she thought we said half of one personal dish and half of another, which doesnt make sense at all but idk man), but if we added another small dish it would have taken another hour to get our pizza. And that's not happening."
,,,,,"Traveled from out of state, wanted to see what all the hype was about for their deep dish pizzas.  Here's my outsiders perspective:"
,,,,,"Got ""The Lou Deep Dish Pizza"""
,,,,,"Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced Roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, Romano and cheddar cheese on garlic butter crust."
,,,,,"It was loaded with all kinds of things that the ingredients start falling off from gravity as soon as you pick it up.  The breading it not super high, what makes it ""deep"" was the insane amount of cheese and toppings they put on top.  "
,,,,,"We got the Large ($20.45) which is supposed to feed up to 4 people.  It came out with 8 to 9 slices and we were ALL full after ONE SLICE.  They pushed for us to get an appetizer since ""each pie takes an hour to make"" but decided to wait so we didn't spoil our appetite. We were STARVING by the time the pie came out, but believe me- one slice was MORE than enough. "
,,,,,"Glad we didn't waste money on an appetizer.  But don't come if you're wanting to try a slice quickly, they WILL make you wait! And that 1 Hour+ wait can test your patience.  We went on a Saturday night at 10:30 PM and the place looked less than half full and the wait was still an hour, can't imagine waiting if the place was actually busy. "
,,,,,"Parking was a beast.  Ended up parking in an open lot after driving around downtown for 30 minutes. All the parking in the area was about $15. Ridiculous, but night be cheaper than an uber going to and from downtown if you think about it. "
,,,,,"I tried it once, and that was good enough.  Definitely not a flavor I would crave but appreciate the experience. It was pretty good though."
,,,,,"It was a good pizza. Long wait (30 mins) got the Lou deep dish. Felt it was overpriced. Got the medium and it was big, but definitely didnt like the deep dish crust (soggy on bottom). Maybe a thin crust would have been better."

,,,,,I heard mixed reviews about Lou Malnati's but decided to give it a shot anyways. One of the must-eats for a first timer's trip to Chicago is deep dish pizza. I don't regret choosing Lou Malnati's for that at all. 
,,,,,"Yeah, there will probably be a wait. It's the famous Lou Malnati's. But that's okay because each pizza takes 40 minutes to cook, anyways. While you wait, you can preorder your pizza and they will text you when your table is ready. "
,,,,,What makes their pizzas good is the crust. BUTTERY. GOODNESS. You MUST get the Malnati Chicago Classic for the buttery crust - you can get it with sausage or pepperoni. The crust is a game changer. The tomato sauce was a bit on the tart side for my taste but it didn't bug me too much. Perfect amount of cheese. Decent amount of sausage. Also the Malnati salad was a good appetizer to get while waiting for your pizza to finish baking. It's light and refreshing and the sweet vinaigrette is the icing on top. 
,,,,,By no means did Lou Malnati's convert me into a deep dish lover. I am still a thin-crust lover through and through. But overall this was one of my top meals in Chicago.
,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Pauline. We are happy to hear you were able to dine in with us and you enjoyed your meal. We look forward to serving you again when you're back in Chicago!"
,,,,,"The best pizza in Chicagoland. No else compares. Being the best place that makes Chicago pizza, that would make this place the best in the world, being in Chicagoland. Skip the rest of the items, and go straight for the Chicago Classic. And if you're daring, try The Lou, and add it with the Malnati Salad. You'll want to look up copycat recipes for the Malnati Salad like I did soon after. "
,,,,,My family and I have been going to Lou's for almost 20 years now. It's insane how the taste has been the same all this long. I can't imagine going anywhere else for deep dish.
,,,,,"Can't go wrong! I have only had great experiences here! Indoor dining, delivery or carryout. Delicious"
,,,,,"I had hear good things about Lou Malnati's and even though I had DDP the night before, I didn't think I could leave Chicago without trying it here.  "
,,,,,"Perhaps my high expectations didn't help, but I was a little underwhelmed.  I had the personal Malnati classic (with lean sausage), and while the crust was as good as other reviews said, the pizza itself was just OK.  From the presentation, to taste (the sausage was a little bland and there was hardly any cheese or sauce), I was just expecting more.  I truly do believe that if I had gone with a group and ordered a larger pizza (baked and served in the skillet), I may have added a star.  On the bright side, their house salad with the creamy garlic dressing was very tasty, and service was good."
,,,,,"My first time ever trying deep dish pizza and of course I had to save it for when I was in Chicago. The wait here is ridiculous, which is always a good thing because you know the food will normally be delicious. The best part is that you place your order when you put your name down and then they take your phone number to tell you when your table is ready. "
,,,,,By the time you sit down your food arrives in almost no time. We came from California so naturally we ordered way too much food. We got the brushetta (would not recommend) the variety of chips and dips (was a fun one for the group) and then one large pizza with multiple toppings. The pizza was freaking delicious but be prepared to eat with a fork and knife! 
,,,,,For everything that we ordered the price was pretty affordable which was nice. It's a noisy and more casual atmosphere so most likely fun for smaller friends groups as the wait can be tough with larger crowds.
,,,,,Lou Malnati's Pizza is not only a clean and well-kept restaurant but it is also very thrifty when it comes to pizza making sure they can dish out what they promise in promotions and ads. They have some of the most well-mannered employees I have ever met and they are easy to talk to. 
,,,,,"When I lived in Chicago, my family and I always had Lou's pizza every Friday, and, boy, was it good. The waiters were always dressed well and always put 100% effort into cleaning a table after a family was done eating there. They were also so efficient to accidents like if someone dropping a pizza after getting bumped or a drinking spilling. I had friends back in Chicago tell me how they were doing and they explained that Lou Malnati's not only limited seats to keep social distancing but also made sure all workers had masks and gloves on. They suggested that guests wait outside where they can social distance more easily while waiting for a table."
,,,,,"Whenever my family went to eat at the restaurant itself, the workers there were so kind and easy to talk to. They are trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, cheerful, clean, and reverent to customers. The workers there before the pandemic always had a warm smile to greet you and that just made you feel right at home."
,,,,,I have never once taken a bite out of a slice of Lou Malnati's pizza and regretted it. The cheese is all melted and there are never any uncooked parts. The meat is cooked perfectly having a juicy tone to it with every taste. The crust is never burned and is always how you ordered it. The crust has the best crunch to it and smells phenomenal.
,,,,,"I recommend you head to Chicago, Illinois to have a tasty pizza with your family. You won't regret having a beer, if you're an adult, or pop, if you're a kid, with a large slice of Chicago-styled pizza."
,,,,,This place changed the pizza world for me. I had no idea about this place till someone took me here. I'm from California so I had clue that Chicago had pizza this amazing.
,,,,,"My first impression of the restaurant was it felt exactly like how a pizzeria should feel, it had that vibrant feel to it. I started to notice the at there were athlete signed clothes on frames on the wall so I kinda figured this place must be a big deal. "
,,,,,We ended up getting an all meat deep dish pizza and a salad as am appetizer. They informed that pizza will take up to an hour to be ready so we were in for a long wait. 
,,,,,"The salad, that I remember was good. More or less than the average salad you can have anywhere "
,,,,,When the pizza finally arrived I've never seen anything like it and it smelled sooo good.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it hahaha so this is what deep dish is. When I first bit into it my taste buds were all over the place with joy. Till this day I don't think I've had a better pizza. When I visit I'll be coming back to this place. Thank you so much for that beautiful memory
,,,,,"I came here by myself and got seated at the bar right away, by the time I was done eating the place was packed and lots of people were waiting outside. If I had to guess the wait time was probably close to 45 min. "
,,,,,"I ordered the personal size of the Malnati's Classic. Since this was my first time in Chicago, I have to get deep dish pizza. Oh man, the crust is out of this world. Its crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. I was certainly not disappointed, it exceeded my expectations. Perks of sitting at a bar: you get to meet other travelers. So great lunch place for solo travelers."
,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Jennifer! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your visit with us and enjoyed your deep dish pizza. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,No trip to Chicago would be complete with a visit to Lou Malnati's to feast on their specialty deep-dish pizzas. 
,,,,,"After a trip to Millennium Park to do ""touristy things,"" my friends and I decided to stop here for a quick dinner. We came at around 9 on a Monday  evening and there was about a 20 minute wait for seats. No biggie. Once we were seated, our server greeted us and took our orders. We settled for an order of fried calamari, Lou's bruschetta and the Malnati's salad. All 3 appetizers were delicious and were amazing to munch on before our deep-dish pizzas came. "
,,,,,"For the pizzas, we settled for the large Lou and a large sausage thin crust. Be warned that the deep-dish pizzas take about 30-45 minutes to prepare since they make everything fresh. Once our pizzas came, we all looked forward to digging in, and at the end, we weren't disappointed. The pizzas definitely filled us up and were delectable. We even had a few slices left over to take home. "
,,,,,"Overall, I definitely enjoyed my experience here and I'll definitely be back whenever I'm back in Chicago. Our server was quick and efficient and even had the patience to deal with 10+ rowdy college kids."
,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Henry! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your food and had a great experience with us. We look forward to your next visit again soon!"
,,,,,"Came to Chicago and had to try deep dish pizza. With tons of options, I did not know which one to choose. Eventually felt that Lou Malnati's was getting more recommendations than the others."
,,,,,I headed over to the location on Wells around 11:30am on a Saturday. It wasn't packed but it seemed like a tour group was heading in there around the same time. I ended up sitting at the bar since it was convenient and they have full service there as well. Didn't get any drinks besides water and chose the Malnati's special (personal size).
,,,,,"They were not kidding when they say it takes about 35 minutes but watching tv for a bit and chatting it up and the time kind of flew by though I kept thinking about the pizza. It finally came out and after a photo, I dug in (with a fork and knife. Fork and knife not required but helpful. When you first look at it, the personal size didn't seem too big but it was deep and heavy so it is enough. The crust was amazing. It was the perfect crispness and felt almost like a pie crust. As for the filling, I felt the cheese was too tough and not gooey at all. it felt like a block of cheese underneath the sauce and meats. As for the meats, it was overwhelming. The sausage was laid out over all of the pizza and there was no other flavor that permeated through. The tomatoes on top also leaked out some water so if I didn't let out the juices, I felt the crust would get somewhat soggy."
,,,,,"I love deep dish and I was definitely looking forward to getting some in Chicago. The pizza was decent but not as good as I expected. Overall, the service was decent as well but I felt a bit pushy in terms of getting a drink (even though I was sitting at the bar). I will have to try out the others to do a proper comparison..."

,,,,,"I have never written a Yelp review, but I felt obligated to create an account after my experience last night at Lou Malnati's on Wells St.  Never in my life have I witnessed such incompetence. We arrived at 7:45pm and were told it would be a 45-minute wait but they would take our order to get a jump start. No problem, as we figured that their deep dish pie would be worth the wait. Boy, were we wrong about that..."
,,,,,"When we sat down around 8:45, our server confirmed the order we already placed and said our 'Classic Lou's Pizza' would be ready shortly. Fast forward over an hour later, still no pizza. We sat there watching pizza after pizza walk by our table. At 10pm, our server finally said she was getting the manager involved and assured us our long-overdue pie would be out in a minute. "
,,,,,"Finally, an under-cooked, still-frozen, inedible large deep-dish pie was dropped at our table at 10:15pm, over 2.5 hours after taking the order. Truly unbelievable, even as I write this 24 hours later. The pizza-brained waitress couldn't even cut it because it was rock-hard, and yet served it anyway. Of course we showed her that it was still frozen, and she could only muster up a 'sorry' before running away to hide in the kitchen. My wife is pregnant, and you served her a plate of still-frozen, raw dough. Absolutely maddening!"
,,,,,"The useless manager did eventually show his face, proclaiming ""I have no idea what happened"" over and over again. THAT is literally your job...to know what happened!?! I am thoroughly embarrassed for the business owner who put such incapable people in charge. This shear level of incompetence had us convinced that we were part of a hidden-camera prank TV show for nearly 3 hours. "
,,,,,"At this point, we went all-in on on Mission Disappointment and asked how long it would take to get a cookie pizza instead...she told us we'd have one in 15 minutes tops. After waiting 45 additional minutes, we walked out in disbelief, having eaten nothing in over 3 hours. "
,,,,,"Aside from wasting 3+ hours at this dysfunctional establishment, my only regret is not finding out what exactly happened. None of their employees could even muster up a decent story despite our prodding. Maybe our waitress wolfed down our pizza on her break? Maybe our pizza went on strike and refused to go in the oven for a few hours before finally coming to his senses?  Unfortunately, we'll never know-"
,,,,,"Buyer beware, do NOT eat here unless paying high prices for frozen, cardboard pizza is your thing. Hopefully this will save others from the awful experience that is Lou Malnati's Pizzera."
,,,,,First time in Chicago and of course deep dish pizza was on my list. Lou's was recommended by locals and it didn't disappoint! The buttery deep dish crust and chunky tomato sauce with stringy mozzarella was like no other. First day in the city and I'm having a hard time thinking this place can be topped! Excellent food and customer service!
,,,,,"Let me preface this by saying the food is very good. If this is what I am to expect deep dish to taste like, I think I am off to a good start. My experience with the service was appalling however. Management, you really shouldn't allow your staff to diminish an experience that should be outstanding. "
,,,,,"To be fair I was one of a party of 13 arriving for a 9pm dinner reservation. I stress reservation, to point out that the purpose of scheduling one is to be prepared for guests. I digress. The restaurant was not ready. We hovered around the door for a few minutes, then escorted upstairs to two tables that would only accommodate a portion of our party. It wasn't until another table of two left that we were able to add our other three members to the group. Fine. No big deal. "
,,,,,"Enter our server, Tonya, or was it Terry? Right off the bat she looked stressed. Was she overwhelmed with such a large group to tend to? Who knows. She made it clear that she was in a hurry and not in any position to be polite. My colleague is Vegan so we asked if they had Vegan options on the menu. No, the pizza is not vegan. We then asked about the bruschetta. Her reply, and I quote, ""are you always this annoying, or is it just today?"" My head exploded! Because I was with work colleagues I didn't snap. I wasn't the only one who kept mum. Tonya/Terry really didn't want to ask about the bread. In a tone that was forthright, yet polite, I requested that she ask the kitchen about the Bruschetta, just to be sure. She did. Anyway, the bruschetta wasn't vegan. I forget what my colleague ordered. "

In a loud voice ""okay, I've got two Classic, where are they going,"" ""well hand me plates and I'll hand you the pizza!"" "
,,,,,"At this point everyone was bewildered at her tone, her body language and her hastiness. When we discovered we were missing two additional pizzas the team opted not to push with ordering them. Since it would take 45 minutes for them to come out. We were quite ready to finish our food and leave as quickly as possible. "

We ordered a small (serves 2) ""Lou"" which has a spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes on it.  It was very fresh (it takes a while to make) and filling.

We got there in the morning literally right when they opened (there's no shame in eating pizza for breakfast!) but we really wanted to avoid the line. I think overall it's good pizza but it gets a lot more hype than necessary. Try it once and then move on."

,,,,,After seeing Hamilton my husband and I worked our way up here for dinner. I was expecting a huge crowd but was amazed by the fact that the place was half empty when we arrived. We got seated immediately.
,,,,,Service however was very slow and took a while to get waited on. Although they have both deep dish and their Malnati's specials we decided to go with thin crust since we were pretty much worn out. Our waiter said it would take 45 minutes to prepare but since we ordered thin crust he said he would check on it and we would probably have it sooner.
,,,,,The main dining area is decorated with jerseys of famous people.  They have near the entrance a sign that says text message area. I guess they must use texting if there is a line. I noticed the place was a bit old and when I went to use the ladies room I had to wait since there was only one stall and it was in a small area.
,,,,,We did however get our pizza in 15 minutes. We ordered a small mushroom and green pepper.Toppings are extra on cheese pizzas and they do note that even if you order half topping then you pay the full price of the topping.
,,,,,I did see many people ordering for take out or doggie bags since you get so much. Place can get very loud at times.
,,,,,There were 6 generous cuts to the pizza. They were good but not anything that I would find spectacular. Maybe if I had the deep dish one that would have made a difference.
,,,,,There are other items on the menu besides pizza. Even for desserts my husband spotted a chocolate pizza but we were pretty full to go beyond the pizza we shared. You can eat either indoors or out. You can even sit on a high top or at a booth. The choice is yours. I

,,,,,"Came here on a Friday afternoon for what I was hoping was a quick bite. I sat at the bar, where a snippy bartender took my order. He ran off before I could finish the order, so I had to call him back and finish adding toppings. After 45 minutes I asked about my pizza, and the bartender brought up that I should've gotten his attention. Not like I spent 15 minutes trying or anything!!"
,,,,,"They didn't clean the seats, so unfortunately I also sat in some pizza sauce. Asked the bartender for some napkins, which he threw at me. "

,,,,,"The ""Lou"":  A vegetable based pizza on top of a delicious garlic Buttercrust.  So much ooey, gooey cheese.  Yum, yum, yum!  We ordered a small & that was plenty for us."
,,,,,"Also, you can get this pizza shipped to you nationwide!"
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's has super great pizza. My favorite pizza anywhere. There, I said it. For years I've ordered Lou ""to-go"" delivered to my house in CA just before Christmas. The 6 pizzas last until Super Bowl Sunday, and when they're gone, I long for my next order at the end of the year. So it's no surprise that my first stop in Chicago was Lou Malnati's for their great sausage pizza."
,,,,,"Being a native NYer that has newly relocated to Chicago, it seems like a casserole tbh, but wow, is it a delicious casserole!  How could it not be?!"
,,,,,"These deep dish pizzas are created with LOVE.  I cannot get over the simply delicious FRESH tomato sauce that bursts ""fresh picked from the vine"" flavors over every tastebud in tandem with the Fresh Wisconsin  Mozz melted to pure perfection.  Our one & only tweak from the classic deep dish is to make the crust ""well done"" as we like crust a bit crispy, and the addition of FRESH Basil.  That's it!"
,,,,,This household enjoys Malnati's so much that my husband & I have gone so far as to dub Monday's - Malnati Monday; as we have had it weekly since moving to Chi-town.  That should say it all.
,,,,,"We have sat in-house once, as this place is a total mad house.  There is always a rather long wait (think hours) and while the wait staff attempts to be efficient, and helpful, it's pretty difficult in tandem with the volume they have.  As a result, we choose to order take out from the Malnati's app, as their delivery charge is $4.  Ooof.  Just know that if you do order take out, be sure to arrive 10-15 minutes after their pickup time, as its wrong 99% of the time & you end up waiting amidst the crazy chaos."
,,,,,"Pro tip:  Try the amazing LIMITED EDITION ""Italian Combo"" while they still have it!  It's lean sausage, Italian beef, topped with ""Chicago Style"" spicy hot giardiniera & tomato sauce.  It's a happy place :)"
,,,,,"Overall: Go for it.  Try it at least once.  You'll never look back at your sad, unhappy tomatoes - from what used to be your go to deep dish pizzeria."
,,,,,Pizza was Very good. I'm glad we ordered a small. It is a lot of food. Beer is a tad overpriced. Do plan to wait at least 40-50 min for the pizza to come out. If you are a larger party they place your order before they find a table which means you wait a lot less once you sit. So if they sit you right away. Don't be suprised if ppl sit and get fiod before you do. I think they have just been Lobby waiting as long as you did. 
,,,,,I enjoyed my first chicago style pizza.
,,,,,"There's a clear divide in the city of Chicago when it comes to deep dish pizza -- Lou's or Giordano's? Well, let me tell you that this girl is Team Lou's all the way."
,,,,,"Lou's has the perfect balance of rich, melty cheese and sweet tomato sauce, that's all nestled in their signature butter crust. I'm a purest at heart, so I opt for the all-cheese pizza or their signature pie which has a layer of italian sausage throughout."
,,,,,A couple of tips:
,,,,,"- Lou Malnati's does not take reservations -- every restaurant seats on a first come, first serve basis"
,,,,,"- When you put in your name, you can actually pre-order your pizza -- highly recommend doing this so that when you're seated you don't have to wait an additional 30+ minutes for your pie"
,,,,,"- The Lou's Salad is highly underrated -- it's incredible, and a great way to put a light twist on the pounds of cheese/bread you're going to consume"
,,,,,"- Please, please, PLEASE do not order thin crust pizza -- you're here in the heart of the deep dish, order right!"
,,,,,"- If you fall in love, like we all do, remember that you can get frozen pizzas delivered across the country. It's a nice momento or a great gift for out of towners!"

,,,,,"The location was very busy at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. Fortunately you can place your order while you wait for the table, as it takes 30-45 minutes to make the pizza. Also, there's a full bar to make the wait time pass quickly. They use text messaging to let you know when the table is ready."
,,,,,"The pizzas were delicious. On our two visits we had three different pizzas. The Classic, with a full layer of lean sausage on top of the buttercrust, The Lou, basically a veggie pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and more on the buttercrust, and The Crustless, which amazingly has sausage replacing the crust. They form the sausage just like the crust, and it eats sort of like a sausage parmigiana. Incredibly good. All their pizzas taste fresh, and they use super sweet tomatoes. I love it."

,,,,,"I got to try three pizza places while visiting Chicago, and Lou Malnati's probably has my favorite sauce. The sauce is slightly sweet with a hint of garlic. We ordered sausage with the pizza and the way they flatten the sausage, you got sausage in every bite. I love that every bite is consistent with the last. "
,,,,,"Even though it's a chain, it didn't feel as commercialized as another competing chain in the area. I'm a fan!"
,,,,,"I've tried the pizza everywhere and nothing compares to buttercrust! Pick your poison, thin crust or deep dish, it all tastes better on buttercrust. Every salad dressings I have tried has been good too, but let's face it, that is all about feeling better about eating too much pizza!"
,,,,,"I had two plans in mind for coming out to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria.  I had heard about the long lines, so:"
,,,,,"1) Put our names down, go get hot dogs at Portillo's which was just 0.3 miles away, and eat them while waiting for our names to be called - also to pre-order the pizzas during our wait."
,,,,,2) Go during an odd time for a meal in the hopes of missing a line entirely - this is also known as the grazing through the day method.
,,,,,"We ended up heading to Lou's after the river boat architectural cruise, and thus unfortunately had hit prime time.  We were quoted over an hour's wait (1 hour 40 min?), but we put our name in because there didn't seem to be much around the area and where would we take a take-out pie?  So we put our pizza order in under the name on the reservation list."
,,,,,"After waiting for a bit, one DC suggested that we put my hot dog idea into play.  I checked in for the current estimated time and off we walked.  Ironically, we ended up finding the largest McDonald's I had previously heard of (the one with museum type exhibits) across from Portillo's."
,,,,,"As we waited for our order number to be called at Portillo's - this after having waited in a rather sizeable line to place our order - we heard numbers being called over and over again, and patrons being reminded to look at the number on their receipts.  But then, we got... the buzz.  Our number was up at Lou's and we had 5 minutes to get to our table!  We gave up on our hot dog and high tailed it back over.  Yes, we became one of those numbers... poor Portillo's."
,,,,,"One friend was stopped by a light, but she told us to keep going.  Two of us both made the next light, but then I realized that was alone, as yet another traffic light had caught my other companion, so it was all on me."
,,,,,But I made it and was told to check in inside to be seated. Yes!  New arrivals were being told of an hour wait at this point.

,,,,,"We had ordered two small pizza pies - The Malnati Chicago Classic $15.95 (Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust), and The ""Lou"" $17.95 (Spinach mix, mushrooms and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano and cheddar cheese on garlic Buttercrust), both well done."
,,,,,"Once we sat, it was 20 minutes to pizza, as they cooked it half way after we ordered it, and then the rest of the way once we were seated.  They looked rather wet, which disappointed us since we had ordered our pies well done.  But we started off on the classic and found a disk of sausage beneath the tomato and cheese layer - yes, that would keep the moisture from dissipating.  But we asked if the other pie could be run through the oven to dry it out some."
,,,,,"It disappeared for longer than expected - I became worried that it would come back burnt.  But it was fine - just a tiny bit charred.  And that did dry it out some.  I preferred the spinach pizza over the sausage, but then I tend to prefer veggies on my pizza."
,,,,,"Hot and fresh - they're really good!  But once cooled, they're not so good."
,,,,,"Service was iffy.  One friend asked for water and received a full replacement glass.  The server left too fast for me to ask for water as well.  When I did manage to ask for water, it was nearly the end of the meal before water was poured for me."
,,,,,I'm not quite sure what I was expecting upon coming to Lou Malnatis.  I did quite a bit of research of which deep dish I wanted to try in Chicago and had chosen this place.   It was solidified by the fact we have some friends in Chicago who suggested we meet there for dinner. 
,,,,,We get there and it's packed.   I mean PACKED!  The wait is 45 min to an hour but they text you and keep you updated as to your spot in line so you don't have to be close.   
,,,,,"We didn't order before hand which was a mistake because our server, while very nice, was overwhelmed.   She couldn't seem to remember what we asked for and wasn't around our table very often.  And she seemed super annoyed by us by then end of our meal (like she wanted us to leave) and we actually never saw her again (I think she left for the night without telling us.)"
,,,,,"The pizza itself wasn't that good.   It wasn't that hot when we got it and the ""buttercrust"" tasted like a dry undercooked cracker with no flavor at all.  I felt like I might actually need to add salt to my meal which I never do.  "

,,,,,"While visiting Chicago, I was told I should not leave without trying the deep dish pizza. A few of my friends highly recommended Lou Malnati's and so I ended up ordering delivery to my hotel on a Sunday evening. The online ordering was easy to navigate and the food was delivered right around the time that was estimated."
,,,,,"I ended up ordering a small build your own deep dish pizza (serves 2) as well as a Malnati salad. On my pizza I had pepperoni, cheese, and hot giardiniera. I wasn't too hungry and was able to eat the entire pizza without trouble. The pizza was decent, unique, but not great. I would come back here again in the future to get pizza in the hopes of having a better experience (maybe all the hype got my expectations up too high). The salad was a very artful creation. I loved the mushroom, bacon, and gorgonzola with a sweet vinaigrette dressing. It was a huge salad and I felt somewhat healthy eating it."
,,,,,The bottom line is I would come back here again next time I'm in Chicago. I think this is a cool experience that is unique to the area and that if you're visiting you should definitely try this out for yourself. I bet the pizza also tastes better fresh out of the oven rather than being delivered.
,,,,,I came back shared a large pizza.  It seamed a lot better than last time.  I think you lose a lot of the flavor with the personal size.  You end with a bunch more crust and less of the toppings.
,,,,,"This is my favorite deep dish pizza joint in Chicago.  Good sausage underneath, large chunks of tomatoes, and a buttery glaze on the crust.  Pretty tasty."

,,,,,"Not bad.  I got the personal sized pizza.  It wasn't too big.  Fairly tasty.  It took 40 minutes, which might be understandable for a huge deep dish, but I felt like this was a bit on the small side to take so long.  If you're into deep dish, everyone raves this is the best pizza in Chicago."
,,,,,"Did I really go to Chicago if I didn't get a deep dish pizza? After coming across many pizza restaurants, Lou Malnati's was one of the few that really caught my eye. I stopped by around 11:30am and it wasn't busy at all yet. It started to get busy an hour later, however."
,,,,,"I ordered The Lou in the personal size (~$12). It is filled with spinach, mushrooms, and sliced Roma tomatoes topped with 3 cheeses and their infamous butter crust! The personal size is supposed to be enough for one person, but I actually shared it. The deep dish takes around 35-45 minutes to make, and this was when they weren't busy at all."
,,,,,"I was getting a bit impatient while waiting around 40 minutes, so don't let that be a deterring factor. And if you're on a time crunch, save the deep dish for another time."
,,,,,I'm not a huge fan of regular pizza but I really enjoyed this deep dish! The butter crust was delicious and the toppings were great. It can get really messy but they do give you utensils and a plate in preparation of this.
,,,,,"Overall, this was a good first-time experience. If I do come back to Lou's, I would either make my own or try something else they're known for."
,,,,,Lou's is my fav local chain for deep dish. I have never had a bad pizza here. Both the deep dish and thin crust are equally great. Skip Girordano's and head here for your deep dish! The crust here is perfect. They also have an amazing salad that tastes too good to be healthy!
,,,,,They do an individual pan pizza which is great when you don't want a ton of leftovers. This location is convenient and gets packed on the weekends so be ready to wait for a table during peak hours.
,,,,,Not a huge huge fan of deep dish (sorry guys I'm not from here) but Lou's was delicious! We went there on a short trip to Chicago and it was a must go (well that's what we heard at least). So we went! and it did not disappoint. When we got the restaurant it was PACKED but of course since it was a Saturday. They were very organized and told us they we should expect a wait for 30mins but it was much less. Always a plus! We were sat and ordered beforehand when we put ourselves in line since the deep dish takes awhile to cook. Tables even pulled out to fit the huge pie on the table. We were happy we ordered a salad too to combat the oiliness.
,,,,,"This place is really good. We loved their Chicago style deep dish pizza. The place is good and clean, nice atmosphere there. Customer service is ok. Prices are ok, not expensive not cheap. Thank you so much."
,,,,,Pizza from Lou Malnati's Pizzeria really amazing and unique taste I eat much time but this shop taste never finds to another side taste.
,,,,,Everyone should have the opportunity to eat at Lou's. the pizza is a masterful peice of art. Yummy eat is slow and enjoy the flavors.. I will be back!
,,,,,This place is a solid 4 stars.
,,,,,"Visited Chicago last weekend and couldn't leave the city without having a Chicago deep dish pizza! I'll get quick to the point. A group of us arrived a little after opening and we were promptly seated. The staff was friendly and the ambiance is very casual. We started off with fried calamari which was good. Not spectacular or anything special, but if you want an appetizer I do recommend that. It was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, just how I like it."
,,,,,"The deep dish itself was also good. I wouldn't say worth the extra hype, but it was good nonetheless. Very flavorful, meaty, and cheesy and it came out faster than I expected. "
,,,,,Worth giving this place a try? Yes.
,,,,,"First off, deep dish pizza was never appealing to me.  Lou Malnati's is know for their Chicago style deep dish pizza.  We ordered a Large size deep dish that feeds about 4-5 people with 8 slices.  I could only eat 1 slice since I am not a fan of deep dish or sausage, which was the main topping.  We also added pepperoni which was and add on.  I felt the pizza was to cheesey and it wasn't like melted cheese it seems a bit hard.  The crunch of the crust was really good.  To be honest I don't even remember how the pizza had tasted.  "
,,,,,The best part was the appetizers we ordered.  We ordered the BuffaLou wings which came with 8 pieces of wings and a side of celery with ranch sauce.  The wings were very tasteful and a bit Spicy.  My group finished the wings and wanted another round of it!
,,,,,"We also ordered the Trio of Dips and Pizza Chips.  The dips were roasted garlic, artichoke and glardinier-topped hummus.  Pizza chips where crips and paired nice with the dips.  The best dip was the artichoke and wasn't to fond of the garlic one.  "

,,,,,"When we got seated, we did not get the pizza yet and we still had to order with the server."
,,,,,I am not sure if the pizza was the best. I had to try another brand to determine that. 
,,,,,"I thought it was a simple pizza, not too flavorful but the pizza got cold fast and the cheese hardens, so eat it fast!"
,,,,,Lou Malnati's deep dish = damn good. I've never had deep dish za before and am so glad that I got to try it at Lou Malnati's during a trip to Chicago.
,,,,,"We got into town pretty late but that ended up working out in our favor. I hear that there is usually at least an hour wait, but at 10 PM we had no trouble snagging a table."
,,,,,"The menu has a ton of pizza options, but because it was our first visit I knew that we'd have to go with the Lou Malnati classic. Sausage pizza with a butter crust... I mean, c'mon. We also ordered a house salad to go along with the pizza. The salad was the perfect precursor to the heavy pizza - light and refreshing with a ton of delicious toppings. But of course, the real star of the show was the pizza. A small pie is the perfect share for two and comes with four hearty slices. The pizza is incredible - the sauce is fresh and taste homemade, the mozzarella cheese is ooey and gooey, the crust is buttery and flakey. I'm still dreaming about this pizza. "

,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Sara! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your food and had a great experience with us. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,I was really looking forward to my deep dish experience on my trip to Chicago. We ended up choosing Lou Malnati's and probably won't be coming back.
,,,,,My wife and I got the The Lou and The Malnati classic in personal sizes. These were the two recommended so I had somewhat high expectations.
,,,,,Here's what I didn't like:
,,,,,-The crust had a straight up stale texture
,,,,,-The pizza didn't come out hot. Cheddar cheese wasn't fully melted on the Lou. What?
,,,,,-Expected more tomato sauce. Only the crust made it seem like deep dish. Without the crust it'd be a pretty normal pizza
,,,,,What I liked:
,,,,,-The tomatoes tasted fresh
,,,,,I wonder if getting the personal size pizza impacted the overall quality of the pizzas. I kind of wish we came in a bigger group to have tried a bigger size pizza. That being said I probably won't give it another chance since there's plenty of other deep dish pizzas to try the next time I'm in Chicago.

We ordered the spicy wings, calamari, and the Lou (medium size). The wings were realllyyy good! Me and my friends were really blown away by how good it was. It was buffalo sauce but not too tangy and it did have a little bit of a kick of spice! We got the 12 piece and wish we ordered another one! The calamari was disappointing. No flavor or salt and the sauce wasn't good. Now that was too tangy. The Lou was pretty good at first but as i continued to eat it, i got bored of the taste. It was really filling and the server said it was enough to feed 4 people, but we felt it was enough to feed 8! We didn't even finish the pizza and there were 5 of us. "

,,,,,"Got the cheese deep dish from their ""Ready to Go""'s. Not bad!!"
,,,,,"Man we can't even agree on Deep Dish pizza.  I know New York and Chicago have their issues, but apparently Chicago is confused on what is a deep dish pizza.  This is more like a pan pizza than a deep dish isn't it?  The crust was golden brown and crisped up nicely in the well oiled pan.  It had a nice pie crust raised up around the sides of the pan as well.  But sure enough like a skateboarder standing on the edge, I shouldn't be thinking that you can do a drop in.  It's like all the fillings sank in this pie and you were left with half a deep dish pizza.  We had sausage mushrooms and pepperoni, so there shouldn't have been a shortage of things to stuff this pie with.  I'd say it was only about 3/4 inch to 1 inch thick, which in the world of deep dish, really isn't that deep."
,,,,,"The best part of this pizza is the sauce.  That's where most of the flavor was coming from and I could have used a little more of it.  It's an excellent robust sauce.  I love the concept of an entire layer of sausage patty like a manhole cover that covers the bottom layer of crust and then layer mozzarella.  However the sausage was very mild.  It would be awesome if they had a hot Italian sausage option.  After the sausage lid, came the sauce and then the rest of the toppings were kind of thrown on very sloppily.  Someone couldn't be bothered to separate the pepperoni, so some pieces were actually 4 pieces thick, and others were just one.  Also the pepperoni lacked character and was pretty forgettable."
,,,,,"Basically the pizza needed some crushed red pepper and that helped a lot.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this pizza and ate every damn bite of it.  But I was expecting the best.  I don't know where the best Chicago Deep Dish pizza is, but some mom and pop in this city is making it.  These larger chains can only be so good because they aren't being made with love."
,,,,,"A few other notes.....It's great that you can order your pizza while you are waiting for a table.  It takes 40 minutes to make a pie, so this way you don't have to wait too long.  I also enjoyed the stuffed spinach bread, which had a nice crunchy outside stuffed with spinach, melted cheese, and garlic.  Again served with their excellent marinara sauce."
,,,,,Probably closer to 4.5
,,,,,"I had this pizza as a kid and wasn't terribly impressed, so over a decade later I decided to come back and give it another go. Lesson learned - kids don't know anything."
,,,,,"One thing I remembered was that the crust is thicker than ideal, and though this is still true, it is made up for by the fact that it's buttery and the right combination of crisp and tender. "
,,,,,"The sauce doesn't quite have that bright, sweet, tomato zing that I look for, but I do like that it's not quite so overly thick like some other deep dish places opt to do."
,,,,,"The cheese is of course of the star of the show here, and there is a lot of it. It's thick and gooey and velvety all at the same time. It's has a nice stretch/pull factor but doesn't cross over into tough or rubbery territory, which is absolutely vital to good deep dish and something that propels this pizza forward."
,,,,,"The pepperoni we had our pie topped with was tasty and though not exceptional, worked as a good complement to the rest of the pizza.  And that really is the story here; A bunch of different components working together to create something great. While some of the flavors weren't home runs, all the textures were, and the different components coming together made this a great meal."
,,,,,IM SO DISAPPOINTED ):  I came to Chicago wanting REALLY BOMB deep dish pizza and I didn't get any... Lou Malnati's was highly recommended by so many people except I had a group of friends who thought this place was a let down but I still wanted to try for myself.  With a solid 4 stars and over 4k reviews and many other locations.. I had such high expectations.. maybe too high.
,,,,,"Anyways, we came on a Sunday night and was quoted 45-60 min wait.  Doable.  We put down our names and preordered our pizza.  We ordered the Lou and added italian sausage.  The wait wasn't too bad, we managed to find seats inside.  Fast forward, we were seated and ordered a salad and couple drinks.  I was so shocked at how long it took the salad to come out... and even shocked at how long the PIZZA took to come out.  What was the point of preordering?!  It felt like it still took a good hour for it come out..."
,,,,,"Finally the pizza came out and it was HUGE.  I excitedly took the first bite and it was just EH.  Nothing special.. as I continued to eat more, I started to come across SUPER salty parts of the pizza.  It was as if they dumped a pile of salt onto the pizza.  At first I thought it was just me but my girlfriend experienced the same saltiness! I also didn't like how they just throw on huge slabs of sausage onto the pizza... like cut it up into pieces or something?!  Literally blocks of sausage on top of our pizza lol.  Meh... such a disappointed.  It wasn't bad, but I definitely don't think the pizza was worth the wait or the hype."
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's Pizzeria you are totally fantastic, I had a wonderful experience here yesterday. Location and service was great. Malnati Salad is one of their very best menu items, I love it, and I think you should try it too. Not to mention, the service was wonderful and the staff was really helpful. Thanks Lou Malnati's Pizzeria."

,,,,,"Overall, would potentially come back here? However, if they can deliver nationwide, I would probably try Pequod's next time."
,,,,,"I would give Lou Malnati's something closer to a 3.5, but out of the two deep dish places I tried in Chicago, Lou's was superior in my opinion. "
,,,,,"I was able to try the veggie deep dish and the meat one, and I thought both were pretty good! Most of my party preferred the meat deep dish, but I silently preferred the veggie one. It was on the soggier side, which actually made it easier for me to eat than the drier sausage one. The thin layer of sausage in the deep dish pizza versus it being randomly stuffed throughout was also a great touch. "
,,,,,"The ingredients themselves were good and the sauce was flavorful, but I could mostly just taste the thicc ass crust. The pizza also took an additional 30 minutes to come out despite us calling 30 minutes ahead to reduce the wait :-("
,,,,,"To be completely fair, I just don't think the deep dish style is for me. I prefer a more equal crust to topping ratio, and not such much of a carb bomb as Chicago pizza tends to be!"
,,,,,The pizza has lots of cheese and sauce. It feels very heavy and after the 2nd side I was stuffed. This Chicago pizza is very greasy. Give it a try if you are in Chicago and don't forget to go before 12 or else the wait is normally 1-2 hours long.
,,,,,I know this is left field but my brother put me onto this as they have a version of pizza known as crustless classic. 
,,,,,"Let me tell you, its delicious. It's exactly what it sounds like - it has no crust. Instead, the ""crust"" is the sausage patty of the sausage pizza. This is a meatlover's special or in my brother's case, a keto approach. "
,,,,,"Either way, give it a try! "
,,,,,"If you order a classic, ask for well done crust or butter crust (might be automatic for butter crust)."

I'm from New York, and if you asked me to compare the best NYC pizza to Lou's I'd tell you they're a separate category and can't be compared, but man Lou's gives any pizza place I've ever been to a run for its money."

,,,,,It was raining and way too cold for our tastes so we decided to get delivery. I was a bit concerned about how the delivery trip would impact the pie. It arrived at our room PERFECT! We were advised to order a small for 2 adults and it was the perfect amount. We had the pepperoni and lean sausage pie and it was beyond good. I almost never eat pizza and at alllllllllll of my share.  
,,,,,This is a solid pick. I'll definitely be back!
,,,,,"Our waiter, Carlos, made our out of town visit a memorable one. He was so energetic, positive and professional. If your talents take you to Lou Malnati's (805 S State Street) ask for Carlos!!!!"
,,,,,The pizza is not good. Over rated experience reviews for the deep dish pizza. I liked the wings and salad.
,,,,,"First experience with authentic deep dish pizza and it was good. Buttery crust, lots of  gooey cheese and toppings make a good pizza. The place had a real old school look to it. Place was busy though, so be prepared to wait for a table. You can preorder tour food at the register while waiting for a table. Definitely expedites the process. But the pizza is worth the wait."
,,,,,"The restaurant on Lincoln Ave. in Chicago has excellent take- out service and offers great value on its food. My recent order of an Italian beef sandwich was accompanied by a plentiful cluster of both red and green grapes (my requested substitute for French fries.) he sandwich was juicy, meat tender, and the bread roll was very fresh.Delicious!"

We got the Lou Malnati's deep dish w/ mushrooms added. The cheese was perfectly gooey, the crust was buttery and perfectly crispy. I loooved the amount of sauce. We walked in the pouring rain from our hotel just to check it out & it was more than worth it! "

,,,,,"I'll keep this short, because it should be obvious by now that Lou's has great pizza. They are always highly ranked nationally, because of their insane crust. It's so delicious... buttery, and crunchy. "
,,,,,"On my last visit, I took an out of town friend who did not think he liked deep dish pizza. Lou's changed his mind on the matter. He discussed this with the waiter, who also said he never liked deep dish before Lou's. "
,,,,,My only negative thing to say is that this particular Lou's location can be a little cold inside during the winter. Just a heads up. Still 5/5 food and good service though.
,,,,,I see why everyone talks about butter crust - that stuff is delicious!
,,,,,"I'm not from Chicago, nor do I live there, but I have tried a few of the more 'popular'/chain pizza places and I must say - I can't tell a huge difference (sorry!!!). They are all good in their own way."

,,,,,"I've visited Chicago a number of times, and I'm convinced Lou Malnati's is the best deep dish pizza. There are a number of locations in Chicago, and this one is a decent size. The service is also very good, and the interior is fun and inviting. "

,,,,,"I will say that I am from the NJ/NY area, so I will never believe deep dish is better than our pizza! But it was a wonderful and nice change (as long as its not permanent lol!)"

,,,,,The best deep dish in Chicago. I try others just to make sure Im giving a fair rating. There's still no doubt who is #1.
,,,,,"We were visiting Chicago from out of town and was told to go here (instead of Giordano's). There were four of us and we ordered a small Classic and Lou's, bruschetta, and garlic bread (with cheese!). The Classic was amazing! The sauce they used was so tasty, it didn't even need any of the extra seasoning some sausages have. The cheese was thick and the sauce was just the right amount. I would, hands down, recommend getting the Classic over the Lou if this is your first time here :) to me it was just the better pizza!"
,,,,,"I would also recommend getting the bruschetta. Everything was fresh and the bread was crispy, yet soft at the same time. "
,,,,,We also got an order of Tiramasu to share - delicious.

,,,,,"Vacationing in Chicago during the winter month has some drawbacks. Your face might get so numb because of the bitter cold that you may forget how many ears or noses you have. However, if you survive, you will get to enjoy some of the best deep dish pizza the city has to offer at Lou Malnati's. "
,,,,,Here are my ratings based on different criteria:
,,,,,"Quality of food: Great. We got the deep dish with cheese. I suggest ordering a size small for a group of 2 as you'll each get to have 2 slices. For a thin crust, 2 slices is not enough, however, for a deep dish this is more than enough. If one has never had a deep dish pizza before, it has basically a thick buttery crust with a lot of cheese and tomatoes piled on top. So...2 slices for lunch will have you pretty full. Lou's pizza is best compared to the competition as the sauce is not too tangy or sweet but seasoned just right. Also, the crust is not overly buttered up. The knife cuts through the crust with a nice pop proving that the crust is baked just right."
,,,,,"Decor: Kinda cool. Every location has a different theme but this one is all about baseball. There are all kinds of White Sox and Cubs memorabilia everywhere. From autographed team jerseys to baseballs neatly displayed in a case, this Lou's is a haven for Chicago baseball lovers."
,,,,,Cleanliness: No complaints. All the tables and floor were kept clean and crumbs free! 
,,,,,Service: Friendly but very busy. The place was absolutely packed at 1 pm on a Saturday. This kept the staff very busy and looking stressed. The entrance area had so many people hanging out that it was impossible to get in/out and almost made it a fire hazard.
,,,,,"Speed of food preparation: As expected...for a deep dish pizza. Something to keep in mind when ordering a deep dish pizza is that because of the thick crust and heavy amount of toppings, your pizza will normally take 35 minutes to make. If a restaurant claims to have a deep dish ready for you in 15 minutes then either they are reheating an old pizza or not serving a true deep dish pizza."
,,,,,Price: cheap. Our small pizza was $15. A glass of Root Beer with free refills for $2.75. A relatively cheap lunch for 2 if you ask me!
,,,,,"Everybody has their own favorite spot in Chicago for a true deep dish pizza. That's what makes this city great! For me, Lou's wins it hands-down when compared to the other 3 big competitors (Gino's, Giordano's, and Uno)."
,,,,,"Thank you for your feedback, Nisheet. We are happy to hear you were able to dine in with us and you enjoyed your deep dish pizza. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,"I came here with high expectations. When I walk into a restaurant, I feel like everything on the menu should be reflective of your skill, not just what you specialize. After all, if you only specialize in one thing and everything else isn't that good, why waste the money to keep making the other things. I came with a large group and most ordered the pizza. But the sight of ""homemade sauces made daily"" peaked my interest so I got the spaghetti. It came to the table with lovely presentation, however, it appears that someone's idea of making a meat sauce is simply taking your marinara, tossing it with some cooked ground beef, and calling it a day. The meat certainly wasn't simmered in the sauce and when I tried my friends pizza, I noted the similarities in taste. The sauce did not stick to the pasta and it came out somewhat lukewarm. No cheese on top. "

,,,,,"We ordered the Classic deep dish pizza, and sure enough it did not disappoint! The sauce on the pizza is definitely the star of the show. It was so tasty and it does not compare to anything we have had before. This probably ruined all the other pizza's we'll ever have again to be honest. The only thing that we have had better is the butter crust. It wasn't that great and to that my girlfriend actually didn't want to eat it. It tasted bland but the sauce or some ranch saved it ;) "
,,,,,The place had a very old pizzaria style ambience to it and it was new to us but we enjoyed it. It was clean and servers were more than helpful to us. 
,,,,,Would we come back and recommend this place? Yes! definitely a place we'd go to again and bring our family and friends.
,,,,,Decided to try Lou Malnati's as my first Chicago deep dish pizza experience. Had to wait about 30 minutes-not and considering how busy they were. The greeter told me 40-50 minutes. You can order your pizza in advance (when you put your name on the waitlist). 
,,,,,"Glad I waited! Had a personal original and a Caesar salad. The salad was enough for two, but I managed to work my way through it. Very good with shaved Parmesan. Make sure you mix it up when you get it. About the time I finished the salad, the pizza arrived. Buttery crust-crispy on the edges and firm in the middle. The sausage layer was mild and delicious and was topped with cheese and tomato sauce. The sauce was tangy and PERFECTLY seasoned. Too bad I was alone, as this is the perfect place to share the experience!! This will be a go-to place next time I'm in Chicago."
,,,,,Because it's Lou Malnati's. 
,,,,,Nuff Said!!
,,,,,"When I told friends that I was going to Chicago, I was recommended Lou Malnati's by multiple people. So, when it was time to try a deep dish pizza I knew exactly where to go!"
,,,,,The place itself is very cozy & warm. They have a cute little separate waiting room where my boyfriend and I sat and looked at the menu because there was about a 15 minute wait. They told us that it takes about 30 minutes to make the pizza so they suggested we order while we wait but we didn't end up doing that. 
,,,,,"When we finally were sat, we ordered the bruschetta, ziti and original sausage deep dish pizza. As warned, our server told us the pizza was going to take 30 minutes to come out so the bruschetta & ziti were brought out about 15 minutes before the pizza. "
,,,,,The bruschetta was very tasty. My boyfriend really liked it because the bread wasn't super hard and he doesn't like the super crunchy bread that's typically used for bruschetta. I liked it too. The ziti was also pretty delicious. 
,,,,,"When the pizza came out, it was intimidating and it was still bubbling from the oven! Our server cut it and served us which I thought was a nice touch because I honestly wouldn't know how to approach it to cut it myself hahaha. I'm really not a fan of deep dish pizza but I knew I had to try it while in Chicago and I'm happy that I did! The flavor of the pizza itself is very good & I loveeeed the crust. But I don't think I'll ever crave it again and that's simply because I don't prefer deep dish. "
,,,,,"If you're going in a group of two, I think you should absolutely get the small pizza. After sharing the bruschetta and ziti, my boyfriend and I didn't even finish half of the small pizza."
,,,,,"Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Period. Hot, fresh, delicious."
,,,,,Salad was great also. Really liked the dressing.
,,,,,A Chicago staple! This pizza place is fantastic! We came here while in town visiting and choose it because of the high praises it gets. 
,,,,,As soon as we walked in I loved the decor. It was unique and featured a lot of Chicago's past. We were sat upstairs in a nice open area that felt casual but had an air of sophistication as well. 
,,,,,Our service was super friendly and have us sugestions and information about each option. We ordered the large Italian salad and the traditional deep dish pizza to share. The salad arrived first and was fresh and delicious but the real deal was the pizza! 
,,,,,The pizza crust was crispy and flaky when I bit into it. The cheese was delicous and the pepperoni and sausage was very flavorful. I am a huge pizza fan and was blown away by how fresh everything was and how much flavor it all had.
,,,,,This place is truly outstanding and represents Chicago well!

,,,,,This place is the #1 best rated deep dish pizza.
,,,,,We arrived at 5:50pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. The beer selection was decent but the sangria was exceptionally delicious (see pic below). We put the order for a pizza right away because at takes at least an hour to make. An hour and a half later we got the pizza (see pic and yes granted it was a Saturday and extremely busy).
,,,,,"We ordered mozzarella sticks in the meantime which was a great idea since it took extra long for the pizza. I really enjoy all the food but mozzarella sticks and their homemade marinara sauce was my favorite. Was it worth waiting 1 1/2 hours for pizza, probably not but I really enjoy the authentic experience!"
,,,,,"The wait if no joke, but given how good their pizzas are..it's worth it. We went there around 6:30 (thinking we were 'going to be the crowd' HA) and then ended up in an hour long wait. They do allow you to pre-order your pizza so that when you are seated it doesn't take as long to get to your table. "

,,,,,"So the question is ""why 5 stars?!"""
,,,,,"The staff (takeout and hostess) were phenomenal!! These young ladies kept their composure the entire time I was there waiting for our order. They were polite and tried their best to keep things moving. We were finally able to get our online order after an hour of waiting inside, and I still had to compliment the young lady who finally handed us our pies. Great job!! You cant get customer service like from just anywhere..I mean that place was soo congested."
,,,,,"Our food was fantastic and actually worth the wait!! Oh...thats pains me to write that..but I truly understand the stampede at this place. We had the Malnati chicago classic (deep dish butter-crust pizza with with sausage and extra cheese), and a thin crust pepperoni pizza-both we delicious. Thank goodness I dont live out there, cause my waist line wouldn't stand a chance against those pies. BTW, this was my first chicago style pizza...and now I may have to give back my east coast NY pizza loyalty card...but we'll leave that discussion for another review."
,,,,,Overall..highly recommend!! Its truly worth the hype. 
,,,,,Pro tip: (this for my tourist folks)..place your order way ahead of time..and be patient during the dinner rush. Its worth it!
,,,,,"This place is busy but they let you pre-order your pizza while you wait for your table.. the Malnati salad was unexpected, and the candied bacon was a great touch. The malnati classic Chicago was heavy but delicious. One slice with half salad was extremely filling.. the small pizza left us both with a slice to take home. The stuffed spinach bread was a bit much after the salad and the pizza but I wasn't mad at the couple bites I had."
,,,,,"Mmmmkay. So I love pizza and I come from NYC which has the best pizza (don't argue with me on this). Compared to Giordano's and Pequod's, Lou Malnati's goes in the middle for me. Giordano's was a solid 2/5, Pequod's 3.5, and Lou Malnati's a 3/5."
,,,,,"My friend and I came here to watch the world cup and sat at the bar. This is random, but I have a thing for people-watching and I'd give a shout-out to the staff at this place. Everyone here is really nice not only to the customers, but I noticed the way they interacted with each other and they were really cute and seemed like one big family, which made me happy."
,,,,,"ANYWAY, so yeah the bartender was real chill and great. My friend and I got the deep dish cheese (as pictured below). And sadly though, it kind of fell flat for me just like Giordano's did. I don't know what it is, but why does the pizza in Chicago taste so bland?! It lacks flavor, it lacks sooomething that I can't put my finger on but it's a something that doesn't make my tastebuds go DAMN THAT WAS NICE GIVE ME MORE. Tastier than Giordano's but less so than Pequod's which was still even a 3.5/5 for me. I don't know ya'll, but deep dish in general just isn't doing it for me!"
,,,,,Long wait to sit inside so we just ordered takeout. The Lou Malnati's salad was excellent. I decided I am not a fan of the Chicago style thick crust pizza. Too doughy e. Next time I will order the thin crust.
,,,,,"Mmmm sorry didn't love it !!! It's good but the toppings kept falling off. I did like the crust. I tend to eat pizza until my stomach hurts, didn't do that with this one."
,,,,,"We were hyped to try this place out since all our friends told us that it's a place to stop by when we are in the city. However, it was beyond terrible. We understand that it is a pandemic season and we have to be extra cautious, but the cashier was unbelievably rude to us. They told us to wait outside until THEY were ready to take our order - we waited about 20 minutes to finally order our food when there was literally no one in front of us. I was informed that it will take about 35-40 minutes for our food to be ready & yes of course, since it's deep dish. But of course, it did not. We waited for an hour, and there it was. We hate to complain, but we had to express our dissatisfaction with the service. Instead, we got yelled at by the lady manager for not understanding their busy schedule during COVID. As you probably assumed, the classic malnati was not even warm."

I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza and compared to others I've had, Lou Malnati's deep dish is just the right thickness for my liking. The sauce has great flavor, and I personally love the slight crunch on the crust. I think their prices are fair and their service is excellent. They cut and serve your pizza to you by the slice, and package up any leftovers you want to take home for you, too. I'll be dreaming of the next time I get to eat at the iconic Chicago pizzeria!"

,,,,,"We have always enjoyed their food. Consistently good taste. Servers are usually hustling to give good service. Their ""Frozen Pizzas "" good at home too."
,,,,,I've had Lou Malnati's Pizzeria before but it's okay the cheese was soft and gooey... but my favorite pizza place is Ricobenes.... lol but the deep dish pizza was good
,,,,,"It's probably blasphemy as a New Yorker to say this, but I love Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. It's not better than NY thin crust... it's different. Kinda like spaghetti vs rigatoni... not better, different."
,,,,,"Was in Chicago on biz, and a stop at Lou Malnati's seemed necessary. Our group ordered several pies, all of which were delicious, with the sausage being a highlight."
,,,,,"So many times, a place that gets this much attention - especially from tourists - is overrated. Lou Malnati's is not. It's a slice of it's city and damned tempting to order via shipping to treat myself on occasion."
,,,,,"This was hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten. I don't even really like pizza that much, but I would come back here everyday if I lived in Chicago. Get the butter crust. You have to wait 40 min for your pizza to cook, but I would have waited even longer if I knew how incredible it was going to taste. Come and you will not regret it!! I just got the original/traditional with butter crust and pepperoni!"
,,,,,"This place never disappoints. West loop location is especially nice. Service is fast, so is delivery."
,,,,,"This pizza was a wonderful ending to our day! We had the Chicago special which was peppers, onions, sausage and mushrooms. The tomato sauce was spot on and homemade. It truly made the pizza spectacular. We also got a salad which is a great pairing with a deep dish pizza. The pizza was delicious and the small was big enough for two people. Definitely will be back to have this pizza again."
,,,,,"Of course, there was a line at the famous pizzeria when a friend and I arrived starving and wanting to experience true Chicago Deep Dish pizza. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait and that we should go ahead and order the pizza. Be warned it takes about 30-40 minutes to make the pizza, so don't expect it to come out quickly."
,,,,,"Luckily, we got seated right away. The decor is a mix of a hockey star's game room and a bar. We were seated by the kitchen which was annoying, since they kept banging the doors and scaring me as my companion and were trying to hold a conversation."
,,,,,"Ordered the spinach bread and it was literally a small loaf of bread filled with cheese. They give you marinara sauce for dipping, but it was bland. Would not recommend this appetizer. "
,,,,,"After what seemed like eternity, our pizza came out. We got a 2 person serving Lou pizza - sausage, tomatoes and cheese. They cut it for you, because it is a little hard to manage. The crust was really amazing! Crispy like a pie crust and the toppings were abundant. This was the best part of the meal. Service was fine and they were diligent about filling up our waters. "
,,,,,"If I visit Chicago again, I would probably want to try a different place just because the atmosphere and wait time wasn't that great."
,,,,,Lou's has multiple locations; we ate at the Wells street location.
,,,,,"We started with the house salad which was amazing, delicious and well done.  "
,,,,,"We ordered a small sausage deep dish.  The pizza was awesome, the crust was tasty; you can tell the ingredients were fresh. This is an excellent pizza."
,,,,,The service was implacable.  We enjoyed our visit!
,,,,,"Overall Lou was a great place. As I walked in I was greeted by a server, there was not a long for waiting and I proceeded to the bar immediately. The server took slightly a bit to approach me as I was just sitting on the bar and waiting. She recommended I try the Lou pizza and hence I agreed. "
,,,,,It took about 30 mins on a normal not busy day to get the food and I was really excited to try it out as I had heard a lot of Chicago style and especially Lou however I have to say the charisma did not last that long for me.
,,,,,The pizza which was supposed to be their finest creation seemed okay to me. The crust was fine however the raw tomato purée in their was making the whole thing very soggy. It was definitely worth a try but not worth the wait or the astronomical price that I had to pay. 
,,,,,Overall 2 out of 5 for the Lou style pizza 
,,,,,Advice: work on service on the very least

Let me tell ya, when the bill came we thought they made a mistake and charged $38 instead of $16 for that small pizza.  Turns out we chose our own toppings and were charged an extra $2.50 for each topping. Feeling bummed that this is NOT Blaze pizza, because they Don't  charge extra for toppings!!! It was an ok pizza but definitely not worth the price we paid.  Really disappointed  the server did not point it out to us. :("

,,,,,"I was visiting Chicago with my friend; we would park our car and visit the city on foot. So, we got lost going to a pizza place; when we checked to see the closest pizzeria, this one popped up. It was said to be the best pizzeria in Chicago. So my friend and I decided to check it out. "
,,,,,"Right when we arrived, we could get the cool vibe emerging from the place. First off, a few people were conversing outside waiting on their pizza. The conversations and laughter coming out the little crowd made us thing the we were off for a good start. We got in and put ourselves on the waiting list for a table. There is an option on putting your order in online while waiting on your table to reduce the wait time; however, since it was our first time there, we didn't want to risk it. So we waited about 30-45 minutes. "
,,,,,"Finally, we were sited in a little corner overlooking the street, but still offered privacy. Then we placed our order. Water came to my mouth when the waitress came in with our deep dish pizza. Let me tell you, it was worth the wait. They have this hot pepper flakes that I spread  over my pizza which give it this little spicy hint. Man!! that pizza was so juicy and  was melting in my mouth. I am telling you, I got much more than I was expecting."
,,,,,"I cannot testify as to whether this place is the best pizzeria in Chicago, but It's the best pizza that I have ever had in my life."
,,,,,"Thank you for your review, Aude! We are happy to hear you enjoyed your pizzas. We look forward to serving you again soon!"
,,,,,"I mean, we're talking history here. As a Chicago-native, I've sworn by Lou's for a long while now. Having recently returned to the city, I've ordered deep dish pizzas to-go and I can't say it's lost any of its luster."
,,,,,"Let's start with the tomato. Clear as day, thick as night, Lou's pours on tomatoes in a chunky fashion that's not for the faint of heart. They contribute to hefty pieces that get saucy when handled. On top is a thick layer of cheese which is so well-prepared, it could stand to be a meal on its own. I personally love the crunchy, moist, golden thin-crust option which, being a thin sliver, leaves room for more pizza. There are locations throughout the city and I've found the consistency to be rather reliable. Gino's East doesn't stand a chance, whereas Giordano's is something you'd have to determine for yourself. Dine in, take out, but please do try one way or another."
,,,,,The Last time Lou malnati's was good was 1979.
,,,,,"I don't know how Lou's managed to remove the flavor from pizza sauce it's naturally flavorful. But this was bland ,along with mozzarella cheese and Italian sausage that was bland  oh but the crust was good"
,,,,,"Hi Peter, we are so sorry to see you had a disappointing experience with us and that your pizza wasn't our best quality. Please send your feedback to "

,,,,,Michelle Martinez
,,,,,Lou Malnati's Pizzeria
,,,,,It takes a lot of effort and talent to remove the flavor from pizza sauce for mozzarella cheese and from Italian sausage but they manage to do this somehow
,,,,,Very excited to try deep dish Chicago style for the first time in Chicago. Got a caesar salad that was tasty and 2 pizzas. The DEEP DISH THE LOU (best item) tasted better than the DEEP DISH CHEESE. I think the tomato sauce was different if not it was the veggies giving the sauce more flavor. Don't hate me natives of Chicago but I prefer other styles of pizza. This is a bit too heavy for me. Staff is very nice. Very casual dining. It was busy the night I went.
,,,,,We couldn't leave Chicago without tasting the famous deep dish so we asked around and they told us this place had amazing pizza so after our ghost tour we walked over to this place and waited about 40 mins for our cheese deep dish and with the famous garlic crust amazing the size small feeds up too two people good size service was great I'll g back for more .
,,,,,"The boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town, and after some researching, decided to try out the lou Malnati's deep dish pizza. I hate waiting in lines, and the restaurant doesn't take any reservations, although you can order online ahead if time, so we actually came just right after it opened, at 10:40am. The restaurant was empty and we are quickly seated. We can were told that the pizza takes 45 minutes to cook, so we started with a salad, which was surprisingly tasty (I guess that's what happens when you put bacon into anything). We did indeed end up waiting 45mins for our pizza and ate at 1139, so despite coming super early, ate at a decent brunch time. We had a small (more than enough for two people as long as you're not famished) and they kindly did half ""the lou"" and half classic"". The pizza itself was ok- it seems like they are known for their buttery crust, which it was, although I found it a little hard. The flavors were okay. I've never had a deep dish pizza so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it wasn't terribly memorable."
,,,,,"Tip: if you want to avoid the line, just come between 1030 and 11, and it'll take an hour to make your pizza anyway"
,,,,,Prices weren't too bad. The pizza sauce is not that great in my opinion. I do love the regular pizza over the deep dish.
,,,,,"This is probably one of the best Chicago style pizza I have ever been to. I was hesitating to try this place out , however it ended up exceeding my expectations. The pizza tasted really good and was not soggy at all. The layers were very crisp and tasted great as well."

,,,,,"The calamari was good, it actually was just ok and nothing was special about it."

,,,,,Make your own pizza
,,,,,I made my own pizza and asked to include light tomato sauce chicken and fresh tomatoes . I really enjoyed the taste of the pizza and actually ordered another one as it was not enough.
,,,,,Two words: HUGE Portions!
,,,,,I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but I can't leave Chicago without eating it either. 
,,,,,Here is what we order and shared between three people.  
,,,,,The Malanti Chicago Classic (medium) $21.05
,,,,,The Lou (small) $17.95
,,,,,House Salad (family size) $12.95
,,,,,Calamari Fritti $9.95
,,,,,"I definitely enjoyed the Lou more than the classic because the classic had too much meat. I know what you are thinking, is she serious? I am. This pie is already heavy so the meat makes its 5X more fulfilling IMO. The salad was huge, like it totally can feed 6-7 people. The calamari was ok, it was a little cold and soggy when it got to us."
,,,,,"I've only had deep dish in Chicago twice and both times was at Lou's, even though it has been good I think I'll try a different place next time."
,,,,,Listen and listen closely if you are unfamiliar with Lou Malnati's. Block out at least three hours if you're truly down for eating the best deep dish pizza you've ever tasted.
,,,,,"We went here on Friday and the wait was an hour and a half. We were unaware of how crazy it can get here, so we had to pass to make it to our comedy show on time. We tried again Saturday night and the wait was even longer. We were 61st in line and it was barely moving. Again, we were way too hungry to wait that long, so we went and got gelato instead."
,,,,,"We decided at the end of the night to just order delivery from our hotel. We had the pepperoni with the buttercrust and my goodness, this was a phenomenal pizza. "

,,,,,"My girl and I deem this place the creme de la creme of Chicago's deep dish pizza! Yes, it could be arguable since we tried 2 previous deep dish pizza joints, but for us.. this baby is undoubtedly the best. This place have the classic Italian restaurant look from the inside and bunch of sport jersey's of their famous customers. Right from the get go, when we stepped in front of the door, the smell of their fragrant marinara sauce makes you hungry. Their customer service is top knotch because all of their staff are super friendly; it is like walking to an Italian family gathering. It really does feel so homey inside; great place to be food wasted with fam and friends :)"
,,,,,"The food is the best part, no doubt! My girlfriend and I just ordered one item on their menu because we're still pregnant from our deep dish adventures. We ordered a small Malnati Chicago Classic that serves 2 people. Their deep dish have the simpliest ingredients compared from their rivals, but it satisfied my taste buds so badly that I wanted to make love with this pizza lol. Their marinara sauce is well balanced with a little bit of after taste sweetness. The freshness of the ingredients are sublime.. this pizza might as well be deemed organic. And lastly, the most important information of all......"
,,,,,"I finished the pizza without leaving the crust. This pizza took the crown because I actually ate their crust, unlike the others. Their crust taste like a grade A butter bread. The price compared from their competition is unbeatable also; for only $16+ a small deep dish pizza that can serve 2 people is unheard off. Overall, I would come back to this city just to eat here.. that is how awesome it is :)"

,,,,,"Tried em' all, and this was one of the best deep dish pizzas I've had. Rich sauce, good selection of toppings, quality cheese. What else can you ask for?"
,,,,,Deep dish Chicago style with the patty sausage. World class in my book. Was once a die hard Genoa East fan. Recently I have been disappointed with GE. Too corporate and lost its identity. Too bad. Great memories. 
,,,,,Coworker bought Lou deep dish from the Midway area location for luncheon ---Wow. 
,,,,,Been ordering Lou deep dish sausage and cheese and absolutely love it.
,,,,,What else can you say except delicious? Make sure to get the special salad and of course the deep dish LOU :-)!
,,,,,We ate their classic Deep Dish pizza with sausage and added pepperoni (it was very meaty).
,,,,,"It was great, and great tasting. The sauce had zest to it and the meat had good flavor."
,,,,,"The service was fast. We got seated right away. Sean, our server, was very attentive and just right. Our pizza came quicker than we thought it'd be so that was another bonus."
,,,,,We'd definitely come back again.
,,,,,I'm a pizza freak and had never had deep dish before heading to Lou Malnati's - and now I cannot stop thinking about it and I'm dying to go back. 
,,,,,"I had no idea what to expect from deep dish - sorta thought it would be a sloppy mess. This was not the case at all. Ordered a small classic (with sausage) for two people. The waiter was amazing - he let us know a) the pizza takes 45 minutes and b) you gotta use a fork and knife to start. This pizza is so wild - unlike any pizza I've ever had. The crust is baked to perfection - buttery, thin and crisp just like a pie. Then we got the perfect layers of cheese, sausage, tomatoes and more cheese. The ratio is out of hand and the sausage is so good. "
,,,,,"Literally, cannot stop thinking about this pizza. Cannot wait to go back. "
,,,,,Ambiance is casual and a little loud. Also had the Caesar salad which was very good despite looking really generic. 
,,,,,Moral of this review - forget everything you know about pizza and dive into a very special slice.
,,,,,Chicago Style Pizza is a personal preference (I definitely am an ardent NY thin crust guy) but Lou Malnati's is the one place where you could convert someone - or at least get them to admit that deep dish is worth putting on the rotation... No trip to Chicago is complete without a Lou's pizza
,,,,,"Table for two on a Saturday evening was about an hour and a half wait. You put your name down and then go to the cashier to place your pizza order (if that's what you're getting), so that they can start making it in advance. "
,,,,,439 N Wells St
,,,,,"After the requisite hour and a half, we got texted back to the restaurant and was ushered to go upstairs where they have more seating. While waiting for our pizza (The ""Lou"" with Buttercrust $19), also ordered a plate of Buffalo wings ($10) and a pitcher of sangria ($30). Wings and sangria come out first - decently slathered chicken that wasn't overcooked. Standard celery and blue cheese to the side. Sangria wasn't bad - wish it wasn't a blend and just straight red wine, but strong nonetheless. Pizza comes out some time later - thick dough topped with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. Got to say, really loved the addition of the buttercrust; it gives the pizza an added bonus of flavor rather than dry bread. "
,,,,,"Service is friendly though it takes time for things to arrive (indeed a busy Saturday night). Although I've had better pizza, this is definitely a place worth trying."
,,,,,Excellent thin crust pizza.  
,,,,,If I had to choose one item from here it would be the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers. It was awesome !!!
,,,,,Chicken wings were good with a smoked flavor. I opted for the bbq.

,,,,,"Solid, delicious pizza. Went here by myself and got a order of bread sticks and a personal classic with pepperoni added. The bread sticks were so garlic-y and so was the marinara sauce, I loved it. The portion was definitely made for 2-3 rather than one but when in Rome."
,,,,,"The pizza: full disclosure I'm from NY and generally do not like deep dish pizzas but I really liked how this one tasted. The ingredients were spot on, but since I'm not a Chicago style guy, it tended to feel like cheesy tomato soup in a bread bowl at times (again its the NY bias). "
,,,,,There was a bit of a wait but they let you pre-order the pizza while you're waiting for your table. I'd still highly recommend it to anyone in the area or lovers of deep dish style pizza.
,,,,,"It takes about 45 min to cook the pizza, but they warn you about that when you sit down!"
,,,,,"I came here with a group of three and got a medium half classic/half lou pizza. The crust and the topping are pretty good, but I think deep dish pizza probably just isn't my thing. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind unhealthy food in general, but I think the particular mix of cheese and bread was too much for me. Just too dense and I felt gross before I felt full. I'd recommend this place if you like deep dish, but if you just want to try it because you are in Chicago, maybe share a smaller serving with other people and get other food as well."
,,,,,Order: Small Chicago Classic
,,,,,This was the second Chicago style pizza place that I tried on my first visit to Chicago. The place was jam packed when I got there and it had a 45 minute wait. Good thing is that they allow you to order in advance and they text you once your table is ready. This really helps otherwise I would have waited 45 minutes plus another 40 for the pizza to be prepared and baked. Was the pizza worth the wait? Yes and no. The pizza was definitely delicious but I've tried better Chicago style pizza in Los Angeles if you can believe it. (It's called Black Bird. Give them a try if you're ever in LA. You won't be disappointed!) 
,,,,,"In conclusion, this is a great place but just be willing to wait."
,,,,,"This was my first time trying deep dish pizza and when I told my friends I was going to Chicago, everyone suggested that we stop here. This is a Chicago staple and the place gets packed. You can pre-order your pizza with the cashier and get on a waiting list. This gives you the impression that your pizza will be close to ready by the time you sit, but we were on the list for about 30-45 minutes and it took an additional 30+ minutes for the pizza to actually reach us. Not sure what the point of pre-ordering was. On the upside, our appetizer of cheese sticks came in relatively fast so it curbed our appetite a little bit. "
,,,,,"We got the large classic deep dish pizza which was more than enough for two people. Looking back, we should've gotten a small or a medium. It was very good pizza and when we did eventually get it, it was very satisfying."
,,,,,"Last time I wrote my Lou's review, I was number 3,499! Over 5,800 reviews now. It's 3 o'clock and there's a 45 minute wait. There's no one better than Lou's.  I was able to snag a seat at the bar after 15 minutes. I was smart enough to order my pizza as soon as I came in! Same bartender - David- he is golden- Sunny chi-Town day & my Cubbies are winning too! "

I knew this location woud be crazy - perfect storm of the National Restaurant Show in town, a Friday night and the BEST pizza, hands down. Four deep at the bar.  I began stalking the people at the bar so i could snag a seat. Ordered my thin crust pizza and a cold Corona as soon as the bartender could see me (smiling). "
,,,,,"perfect timing: 20 minutes later, my pizza arrives as I was able to sit down and watch the Cubbies drop one game (but oh..my Cubbies!!). "
,,,,,This is a very healthy sized individual pizza and I make no apologies for eating the entire pie. It's not often I can get to Chicago and eat at Lou's. This place is incredible. 
,,,,,The bartenders work very very hard - wish they could enlarge the bar area though. 
,,,,,LOVE this pizza.
,,,,,"Not nearly worth the hype. The appetizers were all mediocre, the service was ehh, and the pizza was just slapped together with not much effort. I normally don't get sick or feel heavy after eating, but this pizza joint has me feeling sick and sluggish almost immediately after walking out."

This location is so nice because of their attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable employees. They all know how to properly perform their job and also to treat all of their customers so well. I remember, I ordered Pizza and I have to wait for about 40 minutes, it is for three to four persons, and it is 14 inches in diameter. That pizza is awesome, two slices were enough to satisfy and fulfill your cravings. Their pizza was so fresh and delicious, also really like the butter crust. Absolutely worth it. This has to be one of the best pizza I have ever had and also their place is so incredible. Highly recommend this Lou and try to stop by for you to grab some of their phenomenal food.

,,,,,"Before even getting to the food, we had one dirty fork and one dirty butterknife at our table. Additionally, there was a little black spec in my water. Cleanliness was an issue here."
,,,,,"According to their website, their regular crust is vegan, but not the buttercrust. We ordered the veggie without any cheese with their regular crust. I wasn't impressed. I've had vegetarian versions with real cheese and vegan versions with vegan cheese in the Bay Area that I liked much better. Maybe they just don't know how to make this version well. "

,,,,,"While in Chicago, I had to visit the famous Lou Malnati's. This was my first time having Chicago style deep dish, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Prior to visiting, I figured the wait time would be pretty long since it's a common place for tourists to dine."
,,,,,"I arrived around 5 pm, and the line was already out the door. The host said a table for one would be 50 minutes, so I took my chance and sat at the bar to avoid the wait time. I recommend you try to find a seat at the bar if you're dining solo or with 2. Once seated, it took 40 minutes for my small Chicago classic to arrive. They suggest you preorder with the cashier to avoid the long wait, but even so, the wait is still long."
,,,,,"The bartenders were friendly, and the atmosphere was cool. However, my expectations were high since the pizza took 40 minutes, and when I received it, it was just okay. Not bad, not stellar, just okay. I enjoyed the nice buttery crust, and I ended up taking the rest home."
,,,,,"I'm not sure if this is worth waiting in line for. There are tons of Giadornos across the city, which probably has a lesser wait time since there are more locations. This is the only Lou Malnati's in the downtown area, so all the tourists come here."

,,,,,This was my first time in Chicago and I had to try traditional deep dish pizza! Everyone I talked to said this was the place to go. There are multiple locations throughout the city. It was very good! The wait was 30 minutes at 1 PM - we went to get a drink at a bar next door and they texted us when our table was ready. I gave them 4 stars because of the service. Our waitress only came up to us twice - once to take our order and once to bring us our drinks and we never saw her again. Other than that it was an overall good experience!
,,,,,"Ah, deep dish pizza... what a love/hate relationship we have! I hate it because it takes forever to make. Like, you have to budget 45 minutes for it to cook... and then wait an additional 20 minutes to actually get it because there are a million people already waiting. But I love it because it's utterly delicious and the buttery crust speaks to my soul. I ordered a small Chicago Classic which has sausage, mozzarella, tomato sauce, and that sweet, sweet buttery crust. My god, that crust is divine."
,,,,,"I will always prefer New York style pizza but deep dish pizza is also spectacular. There's no need to debate which is better; New York is undoubtedly the superior style, but deep dish is also tremendously tasty. As far as I'm concerned it's a win/win. Lou Malnati's pizza packs a ton of sauce, sausage, and a bunch of cheese in every bite. It's sauce heavy, but the sauce doesn't overpower the sausage flavor. If you look at a slice's side profile, you'll see a beautiful layered portrait of bread, cheese, sausage and sauce (from bottom to top). It's a holy mixture that's sure to please."
,,,,,"Again, the pizza is phenomenal. The wait is horrendous and the restaurant isn't a terribly organized experience, but the food is completely worth it. You'll have a heart attack if you eat too many pizzas, but it's a must-have when you visit Chicago!"
,,,,,"I came here on my last day in Chicago to get the comparison between Lou Malnati's and Giordano's. And while different, there's no comparison: this place is the winner! "
,,,,,"Service was rapid and incredibly friend. The pizza was different than Giordano's, as it has more of a sauce on top layout to their pizza where Giordano's is more encapsulated. I got the sausage pizza (forget the formal name, but the famous one), and REALLY good. The sauce is complex and it compliments well with the meatiness. The crust was dense but flakey and well seasoned (Giordano's is dense like chicken pot pie, not as good). For starters, we got the bruschetta which had a lovely presentation and had fresh ingredients which sometimes you don't see."
,,,,,"I loved the sports decor too, being a fan of all sports. They had legends like babe Ruth and cubbies like Ryan Sandberg. Lou Malnati's pizza reigns supreme as the winner of my Chicago pizza crawl!"
,,,,,"Bottom Line:  Good deep dish in a casual, average atmosphere."
,,,,,"I didn't know much about Lou Malnati's other than that they are famous for their deep dish but I was imagining a heavy, glutinous meal in an overly decorated and very busy restaurant.  Lou Malnati's was much better than I was expecting."
,,,,,"To avoid the crowds, and knowing deep dish can take at least 40 minutes to bake, we went early on a Saturday about 4:30pm.  The restaurant wasn't busy and while I was expecting kitschy decor, it was rather plain with some various sports jerseys. It was nice to be immediately seated and to start hydrating after an unexpectedly warm early May day.  We immediately selected our pizza and placed our order to get that baby baking! I definitely recommend selecting and ordering your pizza first before deciding what else you want.  "
,,,,,"Next we mulled over the menu and decided on a salad.  We ordered the spinach salad which was fresh and delicious and took the edge off while we waited for our pizza. My husband and I split the salad and it was enough for two or three people. You can get it with protein to be more filling, but we just stuck with veggies."
,,,,,"Speaking of veggies - we ordered ""The Lou"" pizza in a small (four average sized slices).  The pizza was not nearly as heavy as I was expecting.  We each had one piece and took the rest to go in a very fancy cardboard box. Our leftovers made a nice breakfast the next day."
,,,,,"(As Seen on TV: Food Network's ""Guilty Pleasures,"" ""Throwdown with Bobby Flay"" and ""You Gotta Eat Here"" and Travel Channel's ""Food Wars"" and ""Food Paradise"" and Cooking Channel's ""Pizza Cuz/Pizza Masters)"
,,,,,"Not a Chicago style kind of guy, but when in Rome... Pizza came highly recommended. We were seated right away, but was told 50 minute cook time. No problem here. Got the traditional with pepperoni which was really good. I would come here again."
,,,,,"For as long as I can remember Lou's has been my place for great pizza.  When I found a long hair in my pie, yeahhhhhh lets just say that was a huge turn off.  Its been really difficult for me to over come and enjoy their pizza since.  However, still think they have the best in Chicago....just couldn't move past the hair.  If I rate the pizza alone its 5-stars, but this last experience....not so much."

,,,,,"First off I want to say the pizza wasn't bad at all. We were recommended to that place by a ton of people(we are from out of town), we enjoyed the pizza but everything else was TERRIBLE. Thursday night we check in at 6:50. They said an hour and 15 min wait. That was fine, we walked along the river, but the 1:15 turned into 1:40 wait. Then these guys walked in while we were waiting and asked how long it would take to be seated. The guy said 1:30 the group of guys then said we will do take out. As we were sitting down that same group got a table within 15 min. I called the manager over and told her what we observed. She said someone in their group had already called in ahead of time. And gave us some deep background about how a guy from Vegas made the reservation, We know that's false because we heard the guys upstairs saying they didn't have one and they didn't want to wait. We were also seated before these group of guys and somehow they got their food before us. We ordered two deep dishes and they ordered three deep dishes. Also we were there sitting at the table for almost an hour and our waiter visited us for a total of 3 times. We were also given straws that weren't even as tall as the cup. The food was good, but the service was terrible. They get two stars because the pizza was good. Then they get 0 stars for service."
,,,,,"Super delicious deep dish that is more cheesy and satisfying than the ones we have back in SF.  The tomato sauce is tangy and sweet, and the cheese just oozes into your plate.  We got a small and a bruschetta (highly recommended) for the two of us, and ended up with about 1/4 as leftovers. Root beer was a great accompaniment.  Our server was friendly and fast.  We really enjoyed the meal."
,,,,,"Now, this is more of what I imagined a deep dish should be. The crust was crispy and light, the meat covered the pizza, the cheese is nice and gooey, and the pizza sauce envelopes the pizza just right. My only suggestion is for you to ask some fresh basil in your pizza - I wish I had done that since after the first few bites, my palette wished for something fresh and light to cut through all that cheese and meat and sauce - ya know, something that brightens up your chew. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere was quite chilled, service is very professional, and the food came out a lot faster than I thought it would be (although they still ask for a 45 minute wait, and you cannot order ahead of time for dine in). "
,,,,,"Also tried the calamari, and I enjoyed the calamari itself, but definitely wished for a different dip. The dip reminded me of ketchup and wasn't too much of a fan. I asked for tartar sauce, and they don't have that at all. Oh wells."
,,,,,"All in all, super glad we tried this place after the disaster of a pizza we had at Giordano's. However, although Lou's restored our faith with the Chicago deep dish, I do believe NY style pizza is still where it's at. But ya know, if this is your first time in Chicago, do check it out!"
,,,,,"The pizza here is amazing! Def have to check out this place if you're in Chicago. Make sure to make reservations and order your pizzas in advance! This place is often packed, even during non-peak hours. I care with friends at 3 and it was an hour wait for seats. The pizza also takes an additional ~40 minutes to make."
,,,,,No wait and was seated right away for 2 around 7pm. Angelica was super friendly and attentive. I ordered the Lou and the significant ordered the Malnati. Hers was stuffed with sausage and she enjoyed it. Mine was for the vegetarian and the mushrooms and tomatoes were cooked perfectly. Our deep dish pizza were 9 inch personal sizes.
,,,,,The crust is so buttery and crispy! That is definitely what stands out about Lou's! We will be back. Probably order a small next time and do a half and half! 
,,,,,"Lastly, deep dishes take time to make so be prepared to wait about 45 minutes once order is placed. Angelica did communicate that to us so it's not an issue. Order an appetizer in the meantime :)"
,,,,,"I took my buddy from San Jose to experience Lou Malnati's and Chicago style deep dish pizza for the very first time; he had very high expectations as he saw Chicago as the foodie capital of the US. We made the mistake of attempting to drop in on a Saturday afternoon (4th of July weekend nonetheless) and was greeted with a swarm of tourists waiting at the front. The hostess quickly entered our names into the queque and the system texted when our table was ready. She also advised that we preorder our pizza ahead of time, so it would be prepared by the time we were seated (I think this was pure genius! :)). "
,,,,,"We had a vegetarian pizza and it truly met his expectations! The crust was done just right, with the right amount of crunch, and the amount of sauce was proportionate to the size of the pizza!"
,,,,,TL;DR: Phenomenal service suited for high volume rush periods with courteous service + delicious pizza. What more can you ask for??
,,,,,"Absolutely terrible pizza! This was my first time in Chicago and we had Giordanos, Gino's and Lou Malnati's. If you're going to a pizza place, the only one worth going to is Giordano's. At Lou Malnati's we ordered a deep dish and calamari. There was no flavor to the pizza whatsoever."

,,,,,"A lot of people in Chicago love this place, yes the pizza is good, but it isn't the best comparing to other pizza places in the city."
,,,,,First time eating pizza in Chicago so I had to give this place a try. Bottom line: pizza is 8.2 (Barstool pizza rating scale).
,,,,,"I met up with a friend for pizza on a Wednesday night. Wait time for a table was about 30 minutes and it was fairly busy when I got there. The inside has a bar area, dining tables in the back area, and a few benches to sit and wait on the first floor; the second floor is all dining area. You can order your food while you wait for your table which is expedites the  food wait time a bit. They also give you a link to see where you are in the waitlist. "
,,,,,"We both shared a medium Classic Malnati's pizza. With high expectations going in, I was fairly disappointed in the quality. It was good, but not spectacular by any means. The ground beef was menial, and tasted like it could have been baked just a little longer. The cheese was evenly spread throughout the pie, and the sauce was just okay. The crust was pretty good though, buttery crust and crispy on the edges. "
,,,,,"Giordano's over Lou Malnati's... good pizza, but not as good as its' main competitor. Both are pretty good deep dish, but I'd give the edge to Giordano's."
,,,,,Always my favorite pizza place to go to when I come to Chicago ! Never disappoints. Had the deep dish Lou malnati special with extra sauce. Yummm

,,,,,I have no reason to not give them 5 stars. Food was fantastic. Service was wonderful. Good ambiance. 
,,,,,I got the Malnati special (single was plenty) with sausage and pepperoni. I also go light on the tomato sauce and do extra cheese. 
,,,,,"Appetizer - I got the spinach stuffed bread. Some of the best garlicky, warm, perfect piece of goodness I've ever had. HIGHLY recommend. "
,,,,,My buddy got the mozzarella sticks. Would recommend as well. 
,,,,,Will definitely be back.
,,,,,I mean.... Anyone who says Lou Malnati's is less than 5 stars is mistaken.  Best pizza in Chicago.  No question.
,,,,,"Hmm I know that deep dish pizza is a Chicago staple. And Lou Malnati's is as well, but I simply wasn't impressed. Tbh, I've had better deep dish pizza in SF - yeah, I said it. "
,,,,,"The wait staff here was great. The appetizer came out in a timely manner. The waiter suggested their play on ""nacho"" app to keep us going bc the pizza would take 40+mins to make. AH. That's an absurdly long time. "
,,,,,"In the end, the app was okay...and he didn't warn for how large it would be so we chowed down and were nearly full by the time the pizza came. Again, the waiter was great allowing us to go halfsies on putting meat on only one side since I'm the only non meat eater here. With the small veggie (and added half meat), it came out to two slices per person. The immediate slice was good - not great. And within minutes, the cheesiness was no longer that ooey gooey goodness that I was hoping would last throughout my first piece at the very least. "
,,,,,"In the end, we each only ate one slice. Took the other two to go. They were really great about individually boxing our slices to-go too! "
,,,,,"Personally, I probably wouldn't return. It's just not my thing. But the staff is great. The food takes a longgg time. And the pizza was okay. 3 stars."
,,,,,"What I ordered: The Lou, large size (feeds 4-5)"
,,,,,Price:$29.25
,,,,,Rate: 8.5/10
,,,,,"Okay so I'm from California and I never really had OUTSTANDING deep dish pizza. Of course, when I'm Chicago, you HAVE TO get deep dish pizza. I stumbled upon this place on a bunch of different ""must-eat places to eat in Chicago"" blogs, and trust me, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The Lou has no meat on it but we didn't realize it until it was brought to the table. My family are huge carnivores but we were not disappointed at all with this vegetarian-friendly pizza. We still had so much different food to try in Chicago so we were actually quite happy to not have that ""food coma"" type of feeling after eating something heavy and greasy. The crust was honestly the star of the show. Super buttery and flakey, I could literally just eat the crust by itself and I would be happy. "
,,,,,"They are nice enough to let you order your deep dish while you are waiting for a table, because they usually take a while to cook. We got seated in about 15 minutes and waited maybe another 20ish minutes at the table."
,,,,,Excellent deep dish pizza and wings. The buttery crust stayed crunchy through whole meal.
,,,,,Nice crispy rust... 
,,,,,Nice place...
,,,,,You need at least 45minute just for get the pizza!
,,,,,But very crowded... still full a midnight
,,,,,"This was the first place we went once we landed in Chicago! We got The ""Lou"" which was the veggie pizza. So easy to over order! You may think you need a medium because you're hungry but you only truly need a small for 2 people. We had most of the pizza come home with us and ate over the course of our stay. "
,,,,,The wait for the deep dish pizza is about 45-50 minutes so don't anticipate getting in and out quickly. Well worth the wait. Plenty of delicious appetizer and drink options to hold you over. 
,,,,,Restaurant was well kept and staff very polite and attentive. Went on a Thursday evening and there was no wait and no need to call ahead to get on the wait list. We were seated immediately. Absolutely recommend!
,,,,,"Visiting Chicago and ordered takeout......my pizza was delicious beyond my wildest dreams.  OMG, the Hostess was beyond courteous, friendly and helpful, she is an positive asset to the establishment.  Keep up the great teamwork and one of the best pizzas I have eaten in a long time.  I ordered the thin crust crispy cheese pizza with basil and spinach. Yum Yum Yum!!!!!!'"
,,,,,Having friends from Chicago they always insisted that I check out Lou Malnati's as it was their favorite deep dish pizza place.  Plus having been  to Giordano's before it was time to finally settle the deep dish champion argument.
,,,,,Giordano's vs. Lou's is a pretty sensitive topic as friends from Chicago are pretty adamant on either Giordano's or Lou's being better and it is split pretty evenly.  
,,,,,"We arrived at Lou's and although there was a wait to be seated, they let us order our pizzas right away as they take some time to cook.  We just had some drinks at the bar and when our table was finally ready our food came pretty quickly.  "
,,,,,"We started with the calamari which was pretty good but the stars of the show were definitely the pizza.  We were a party of 3 and ordered 3 medium pizzas which was pretty much enough for like 10 people.  I had the Malnati Chicago classic but i added some pepperoni, mushrooms, and hot giardiniera.  All I can say is WOW so freaking amazing."
,,,,,"Although it is a deep dish pizza, it is definitely not as thick as Giordano's which has an extra layer of dough on top.  Giordano's is more of a stuffed pizza vs. Lou's which is more traditional.  I prefer Lou's as I don't need to be eating another layer of carbs.  Lou's crust is soooo buttery awesome as well.  "
,,,,,I let my friends take home the plethora of leftovers and they had pizza for days.  I was very jealous as I could have eaten Lou's for a week straight.  
,,,,,Overall Lou's did not disappoint and for me wins the deep dish crown.
,,,,,"I haven't been to Chicago in ages, so on my most recent trip it was decided that my husband and I must have deep dish pizza."
,,,,,"We had a reservation for 6:30pm on Saturday and still had to wait a good amount of time to be seated. The queuing and pre-order area was a mess (they really need someone wrangling this process and letting fewer customers into the front portion of the restaurant...the crowd I experienced was a fire hazard FOR SURE). I was tempted to turn around and walk out but I am glad I stuck it out. Once we were seated, things felt much more relaxed."
,,,,,"I was spoiled during the years I spent living in NYC, and now that I live in DC, I find our pizza to be sadly mediocre."
,,,,,"This was certainly a step up from DC pizza. Deep dish is not my favorite (no way could I eat it all the time!), but it was more about the experience. Our friend suggested the spinach mix as a topping and it was a solid recommendation."

,,,,,"We were in a time crunch to make our 7PM jazz performance. Our choice was wait 55 minutes for a table or get a take out pizza in 40 minutes. We got the small Malnati Chicago Classic $16.25 to go. Waited at the bar and scarfed our pizza as we walked the 4 blocks to the jazz venue. I'll just say that this was an awesome pizza and it changed my opinion about Chicago pizza. Crust, meat, cheese, tomatoes... it all worked well together. I still like thin crust pizza better but if you are in Chicago, you must eat here. Check it out."
,,,,,Listed in Drive Across America: 
,,,,,"Ordered for delivery to my hotel. Easy ordering, delivered quickly, was at the right temperature, and they even brought me a plate, silverware, pepper flakes and Parmesan! I ordered a personal deep dish and it was good. I highly recommend getting the butter crust because you can taste the difference. It came with lots of cheese and abundant toppings. The tomato sauce was bland though. It tasted like it's missing something like maybe some salt? That's why I gave it only 4/5 stars. Overall it was a good pizza and I'd highly recommend!"
,,,,,"Great Chicago pizza. The thin crust is delicious but I prefer the thick crust. Not as thick as some other Chicago places but solid. I prefer the sausage or sausage and mushroom.  It's not my absolute favorite Chicago pizza, that's Gino's East. But Lou's is still consistently 5-star quality."
,,,,,First pizza experience in Chicago. Early dinner got our party of five in minutes. On the way out there was a hefty line. 
,,,,,"We ordered a deep dish and cheese sticks to tide us over. Don't be in a hurry, deep dish took about 40 minutes...but worth the wait. Best. Pizza. Never had deep dish and here you are. So delicious. The sauce is on top and big tomato chunks, a layer of sausage, cheese and buttery crust. Large was 7 slices of amazing. "
,,,,,Great hostess and wait staff. 
,,,,,Can't wait to have a bite of cold pizza in the morning.
,,,,,"We were so impressed from our last visit to Lou Malnati's (state st location) that we came to this location to get more pizza a couple days later! No wait at 4pm on a Saturday, which was great. The restaurant is unique and charming. Before we got the pizza, we got the cheese bread. It's a little pricey (I believe $7.95?) but it was a little garlicky, and a good appetizer since the pizza takes 30-60 minutes to cook, and depending on how busy the restaurant is. It comes with a delicious tomato sauce that has really fresh flavors and balances out the cheese & bread combo. I'd recommend the bread for sure. "
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were once again impressed by this Chicago deep dish pizza. We tried the Malnati deep dish last time with mushrooms, so this visit we decided to get the Lou. We liked the Lou even more than the Malnati. It was a lighter pizza, and the crust is my favorite part. This deep dish is a little less deep than the Malnati, for reference. The sauce is super good, too, and you can tell that the cheese is fresh and excellent quality. It's no wonder why Lou Malnati's is famous! Great service, delicious deep dish pizza, and overall a satisfying visit at this location!"
,,,,,"Being a tourist in Chicago for the 3rd or 4th time it was important for me to really figure out the best Chicago pie this time around.  The two names I heard most often were Lou's and Giordano's.  Lucky me, both places were in walking distance from my hotel.  I decided to try Lou's first, and boy was I impressed."
,,,,,"I already had some pretty high expectations of the place and was doing my best to not get my hopes up too high.  Walking in mid-afternoon on a weekday the place was already very busy.  Asked to be seated and was also asked for my order ahead of being seated (genius really).  Picked the classic and waited to be seated.  Only waited about 10 minutes and then another 25-30 before the pizza came out.  It was fantastic, nothing showy or fancy, just simple ingredients that made the perfect pie.  I'd say the thing that really separates Lou's from the other is the crust, so buttery, cooked to perfection and really brings everything together.  Definitely the winner here."
,,,,,"I've been to all the well known pizza places in Chicago, but I have to say that this is definitely the winner. I highly recommend the Lou, it's one of their signature deep dish pizzas and tastes incredible. "
,,,,,"Make sure to make a reservation in advance. The wait for when I went was about 1.5 hours, but luckily my friends made a reservation beforehand."
,,,,,"Ok. First of all, this place always has a wait-so be prepared to WAIT! It can get annoying. But you can place your pizza order ahead of time so it doesn't take 45 minutes while you're there. "
,,,,,So we FINALLY get seated after lots of confusion (every 18 year old works here) and ordered a couple appetizers-the calamari and the spinach cheese bread (or something like that)... the Malnati's salad and they arrived fairly shortly after our order. 
,,,,,"I all of the sudden forgave them all for the confusion that we endured after my first bite of this perfect salad. It's so perfectly balanced. Then the calamari...they are delicious, not rubbery fried to perfection. But what's even better is that sauceeeeee....it's marinara with cocktail sauce...STOP AND BEHOLD! This is the sauce of sauces...I wanted to drink it! So here I am so happy thinking can it really get better than this....&"
,,,,,Guess what???? It does!!!
,,,,,The pizza comes out...piping hot with these crisp fresh veggies and ooey gooey delicious cheese. I mean this pizza is good! 
,,,,,Our Uber driver told us we picked the right place for the perfect pizza and I agree! I'm not a pizza lover...but this place can easily make me one!! Would have been 5 if it wasn't for the people who work here being so confused!
,,,,,Service was good. We did not have to wait to be seated. They follow all COVID19 protocols.
,,,,,We really liked the salad although it had a lot of dressing. We could have asked for the dressing on the side.
,,,,,Their pizza was bland. We have had Chicago style pizza before in Giordano's and we think Giordano's is better. This one lacked flavor and character
,,,,,"I really really really wanted to love Lou Malnati's, but to be honest, it didn't completely live up to my expectation!"
,,,,,"It was only a 25 minute wait when we got there around 5:45pm which I was extremely surprised about, but didn't complain! What I did appreciate is that you order your pizza ahead of time so that you're not waiting aaaaaas long when you get to your table."
,,,,,"We got the classic deep dish, bar-b-Lou wings and garden salad (all to share)"
,,,,,The wings were actually really good and the garden salad was as basic as they get.

,,,,,"When we arrived, we were seated promptly and our server came to greet us quickly. We ordered 2 blue moon beers, as well as a bruschetta appetizer. We placed our pizza order as well, since the pizza can sometimes take some time to cook. Our starters were relatively tasty, but I noticed that we were waiting quite a while for our pizza, which I could understand that it was a busy Saturday night and the pizza was also deep dish which can take some time. "
,,,,,"Our server helped us by cutting and serving our first slice of the pizza when it arrived and I rushed to take a photograph for the review before digging in. The overall flavor was good, but the crust was honestly somewhat bland. We ended up checking the menu to see if the pizza ultimately came with the buttercrust, which it did - but it didn't taste like that at all. The delicious taste of the cheese, sauce, and veggies were ultimately mitigated by the crust to our displeasure. "
,,,,,"Overall, our experience was good and we enjoyed most of it. I would question the flavor of the crust quite a bit, but everything else was decent. We wouldn't hesitate to return, but next time might order a take out pizza so that we can ensure the crust is flavored or add flavoring at home."
,,,,,"The deep dish pizza seemed overpriced & lacking in flavor, nothing to write home about. Staff were friendly though."

I heard Chicago likes there's pies extra saucy tomatoey ( I don't) so I pleaded with the waiter to do ""light"" sauce and even through they didn't want to make any changes he complied and I'm so glad cause it still had too much for my taste BUT it was very tasty and filling! Wow! It's unlike any pizza I have had before. Very fresh and pieish but worth it to try! I can see why they have so many locations now. Glad we skipped appetizers, we splurged and got a medium Malnati's Chicago Classic for two people and had a ton still leftover. (Could have went with a small like the menu suggested - but we were hungry ) Lesson learned and glad we tried some authentic Chicago Deep Dish"
,,,,,Delicious deep dish Chicago pizza. A.MA.ZING.
,,,,,"I ordered the classic Malnati's pizza and added Pepperoni. Also ordered the fried calamari to enjoy as an appetizer while the pizza was being made. We were told it would take 40 mins for the pizza to come out and it really was 40 mins. Worth every minute though. The pizza was not that cheesy, had a huge full layer of sausage and then topped with delicious pepperoni slices made for heaven on a plate. The service was also very friendly and attentive. I would come back the next time I'm in Chicago!"
,,,,,FIVE STARS!!  
,,,,,I think the current rating of 4.5 stars with over 5000 reviews should tell the story well enough but if you want more....
,,,,,"It was our first time here and our first true Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. Let's just say that Lou's did not disappoint.  We ordered the small classic pizza and a bowl of minestrone soup. Wow.  Great flavors. It's kind of a joke but expect a nice buttery crust with a hint of cornmeal, the restaurant's own proprietary recipe Italian sausage, industrial-strength cheese all topped with a bright and chunky tomato sauce that tastes like tomatoes off a vine. Mmmm.   The souped was rich and tasty.  My recommendations are whatever size pizza you think you need, buy the smaller one!  (It is really filling.). The second is take an UBER as the parking sucks. "
,,,,,Yummy!
,,,,,Yummy deep dish pizza! We also got the Malnati salad wish was also really good! You can get a smaller pizza then you think you want because they are obviously thick and hearty. A good spot for people wanting deep dish.
,,,,,"Not worth the hype. Came all the way from CA and I was told I must try the deep dish pizza that Chicago is famous for, yuck. Did not like it at all. Perhaps because it was the veggie is was SUPER bland and the crust tasted like dough. Would not come again."
,,,,,Yummy heavenly deep deep dish.  My first Chicago style pizza and it sure didn't disappoint.  Go early because the line goes out the door at 6 pm.

,,,,,Amazing deep dish. Definitely worth the wait!!!! I ordered the Lou and my husband got pepperoni. Definitely a must try in Chicago!!!
,,,,,"When in Chicago, do as the Chicagoans do and that means deep dish pizza! Lou's is a staple of Chicago and there are a bunch of locations throughout Chicago. If you're planning to come here, expect to spend quite a bit of time here because each pizza is made to order and takes anywhere from 45-60 minutes. If there's a long wait, you can place your order while waiting for a table so your pizza will come out as soon as you are seated."
,,,,,"We had a mishap when we went here. The runner delivering our pizza didn't cut it properly and when he was trying to serve us slices, it fell flat on the table. Luckily, the manager, Matt, came by and took care of us. He was apologetic and got us another pizza within minutes. We were apprehensive because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for a replacement pizza but he said he stole another pizza on the assembly line. It wasn't the exact same as our order but it was close enough."
,,,,,"Anyhow, the pizza was great! Don't be one of those people that eats deep dish pizza with your hands or you'll look like a total fool! We got the Malnati Chicago Classic and it was fantastic. The way the cheese just melts over the pizza is terrific. The Buttercrust was phenomenal and crisp! I didn't care too much for the sausage. They just stick a giant sausage patty over the pizza which doesn't really sit well with me. "
,,,,,"Aside from the serving blunder, Lou's always lives up to expectations."
,,,,,Oh the agony...
,,,,,What a wait!  
,,,,,"With a line down the block and maybe an hour wait until you're seated, you're going to get HANGRY.  So plan accordingly because you're also going to have to wait another 45 mins to an hour after you order because it takes some time to bake the pizza too."
,,,,,"With all that said, listen...you're in Chicago so you got to try some deep dish pizza and if you love pizza as much as I do, you'll wait and wait....and then wait some more....until someday and someway you'll finally be seated.  Idk if its the best ever, but its pretty good.  "
,,,,,"It comes out fresh of course, its fully loaded with all the toppings and ingredients, and it has a BUTTER crust....yummm.  So it is definitely going to fill you up.  Its different of course than your standard pizza and kind of hard to describe.  The crust is crumbly?  "
,,,,,"But anyway, this pizza is thick!  I've never had pizza with a fork and knife but thats what people do here lol.  Definitely recommend it for the pizza lover in you. "
,,,,,Buon appetito!
,,,,,"I mean.....you can't really go wrong here.  Maybe not the best ever or even in town, but so good there's really nothing not to like.  I would recommend if you do a salad to get the Lemon Garlic creamy dressing.  We had a Lou and a cheese with Olives.  Very different but both good.  Note it will take 35 minutes to cook your deep dish pizza and they are bigger than the estimate of how many they feed on the menu."
,,,,,Came in around 4 pm on a Sunday and was seated immediately with a party of two. We chose the small classic deep dish pizza. The waitress warned us it may take about 45 min to be ready and it did take the entire time! 
,,,,,"The pizza was very good! The crust was amazingly crunchy and definitely the highlight of the pizza. There is a thick layer of cheese, along with sausage and pizza sauce. I wish that it could have been a little warmer so the cheese would have been more gooey and maybe a little more sauce. The small was actually the perfect amount for 2 and we were incredibly stuffed afterwards."
,,,,,"Deep dish is a Chicago stable everyone tells you to try. Especially here with the buttery crust. The wait is always long, but I love how you can order ahead before you're even seated! When you check in for a table, you can order whatever you'd like ahead of time inside right after. The deep dishes usually takes at least 40 minutes to make! So crazy, but so worth it. The sauce is made from scratch and you can tell how fresh it is. The cheese could be more stretchy and quantity of that is pretty low even though we ordered the cheese deep dish. The waiters here are ok. They're too busy to come by to check on you often or remember to bring you something you've asked for. We had a waitress forget to bring us a condiment. She came to bring the deep dish when we asked for the hot sauce and that was the last time we saw her near us."
,,,,,Great pizza. I'm more of a New York style kind of guy. But it had great taste. Would go back for sure. I'm interested in trying more pizza and some other food they have. Coming back when I go back to Chicago.
,,,,,"I was blown away with how on top of their carryout game they are! Our food was fresh out of the oven and we didn't even have to leave our car! We ordered online and paid, so we only had to pick up. We were greeted as soon as we parked, the gentleman called in to let the inside know we were there and our pizza was right out! In these crazy times, it was really nice to be able to enjoy a fresh, hot, deep dish!"
,,,,,"This place was highly recommended and it didn't disappoint. Waited 2 hours here once you put your names down. Make sure you walk inside right away and pre-order your deep dish because it apparently takes an hour to make it. Once you sit down, it takes another 30 mins to get your pizza.  Not sure if it's really worth the wait because this wait time wouldn't fly in NYC. "
,,,,,"The deep dish here isn't as deep as we thought it would be. However, it was filling and the ingredients were fresh. Absolutely loved the crunchy crust. The pizza was good but not very mind blowing. Maybe I just love NY pizza and thin crust more. Lou Malnati's is definitely worth a try though."
,,,,,Our favorite pizza to get. We always order the deep dish with their salad and Lou's dressing!!

,,,,,Wait was a bit long and they could have done better about letting us know we can order ahead of seating. Waitresses were very nice and accommodating. Pizza was great! Expect a wait if you are just walking in. Definitely worth the visit!
,,,,,Stopped in here for a late lunch/early dinner while on a work trip. I know there's a great debate around who has the best authentic deep dish pizza. I'm no deep dish expert but Lou Malnati's seems to know what they are doing!
,,,,,I started with the malnati salad and that was a solid life choice. The blue Gorgonzola and olives were nice touches. It was a bit more expensive than other salads but totally worth the up charge in my opinion. You could possible share this with someone else (if you're into sharing) as an appetizer if you wanted. 
,,,,,Then I opted for a basic pepperoni deep dish pizza for one. It was kind of fantastic. Crispy on the outside and not at all soggy like other deep dish pizzas. Overall I'd come back next time I'm on Chicago so grab a beer and some pizza and maybe a salad and enjoy. These guys know what they are doing.
,,,,,First deep dish in Chicago-
,,,,,"Tip of the day: Go to the bar, find some seats, and order the deep dish at the bar! It'll save you that 1 hour wait! "
,,,,,"We did and didn't have to wait in that ridiculous wait right smack in the middle of lunch. We even got some beers in us while waiting for the deep dish to come out- which usually takes about another 45 minutes. So if you waited in that line, then ordered you'll be looking at 1.5-2 hours before eating..."
,,,,,"They have personal deep dish and some lunch specials. We both got personals just because I wanted my own and my own toppings. I got a pepperoni deep dish (no butter crust) and my BF got a sausage, olives with a butter crust and a side of those pickled peppers. We split half and switched it so we can try both. I just thought the deep dish was ok. The tomato sauce was too sour- like it wasn't cooked down enough, and cheese was pounded on (not completely melted- so you get big chunks) and not enough pepperoni. Few slices... Also the crust was super hard. Was not too big on their deep dish. Or maybe we ordered the wrong size and it was made differently? "
,,,,,Place is iconic for deep dish though since you have to try when in Chicago. We tried another Chicago deep dish place (Peqoud's) and that blew our minds! But still come here to compare! And it's like one of the godfathers of traditional deep dish. We don't regret coming here and enjoyed the atmosphere!
,,,,,"Yaaaaay Chicago deep dish!!! I was waiting for this and was not disappointed. My friend ranted and raved about it so we had to get some. We both ordered a personal size deep dish, I ordered the veggie pizza and he ordered the pepperoni ($32-ish). It was around 4:30pm when I placed the order online and the earliest pick up was 6:30pm. Sheesh! So we walked down from Springhill Suites at about 6:30pm. It was about a 10 minute walk, but I think we took the long way. "
,,,,,When we walked in it was chaos. People everywhere either waiting for tables or waiting for pizza. I couldn't even get a good look at the place but I did see that they had some outdoor seating in addition to tables inside. People dining in were being told it would be an hour wait just for pizza once they got a table. Wow! Glad we ordered ahead. 
,,,,,"When we got back to the hotel, he was shocked that the personal size was so small and the crust wasn't really that deep. I wasn't surprised, although my pizza seemed a little more deep dish than his, maybe because I had more stuff on mine. It was so good, the sauce, the veggies, the cheese! I will say although I ate the crust, it didn't have any flavor to it. Maybe that's why they offer a butter crust option? Anyways, I will be back here for sure!!!"
,,,,,"5 stars for this pizza that blew me and my girlfriend's minds away. We had previously come from NYC and California, so the whole ""who's got the better pizza"" debate was finally coming to a conclusion. We had tried some Lou Maltani's at a street festival the previous day, and were extremely impressed with not just the taste of the pizza, but also the INSANE cheese pull. We knew we had to go to the actual restaurant to try this pizza out."
,,,,,"We arrived around 6:30pm on a weekday, and already there was a massive line. We put our name down along with our order, and were told to come back after we got a message saying we would be seated soon. We walked around, came back, and then got seated upstairs. We were so hyped for the pizza - we couldn't contain our excitement. We had both had deep dish pizza before in another restaurant in Chicago as well as also other places, but none of those had left any impression on us. When the pizza finally arrived, our server cut the pizza into 6 slices, and served us each a piece. "
,,,,,"When we started eating the pizza, that's when we knew... this pizza was too good to NOT be considered as pizza better than NY style pizza. However, it was then and there in my mind that I knew for a fact that it was certainly better than California-style pizza. This pizza was just so rich and luxurious. The cheese was insane, nothing like I had experienced with eating pizza before. Nowhere had I experienced such a satisfying yet delicious cheese pull! My girlfriend and I left extremely full and content - we never knew that deep dish pizza could taste so good!"
,,,,,"Now, whenever I think of Chicago, I think of Lou Maltani's pizza. I was a doubter before, and I'm deeply sorry for that. I still don't think if the NYC vs. Chicago pizza debate will be settled, but one thing I do know for certain is that this pizza was AMAZING! I can't wait to be back!"
,,,,,Small pizza was enough for two!  Salad was fresh and delicious! We sat at the bar because still a wait at 830pm.   Very convenient location!
,,,,,"Delicious pizza, good atmosphere, and they handled covid precautions very effectively."
,,,,,"We arrived for an early dinner on a Sunday night and by the time we left, the crowd outside was bigger than the crowd inside. It takes 45 minutes to bake so I highly recommend ordering while waiting for a table so there is less wait once you are finally seated. We did order a Malnati's salad and all the ""stuff in it"" made for a very tasty bowl of roughage. "
,,,,,"Prompt and friendly service, plan your time accordingly if you're dining in. In this tourist's opinion between Malnati's and Giordano's, Malnati's wins. The crust is more flavorful and I think has a better texture - and less dry. Don't get me wrong, that stuffed pizza is good but if I had to choose between the two - BUTTERY CRUST #ftw"
,,,,,Buttercrust! BUTTERCRUST!!!!!!
,,,,,Excellent pizza in a pizza loving town.  
,,,,,Multiple pizzas eaten in Chicago.  This was my favorite.
,,,,,"When we arrived, the place was packed with people standing around the entrance, waiting to be seated. When we signed in to get a table, they told us we can preorder our pizza. We ordered the Malnati chicago classic, which is the deep dish with sausage and cheese. We waited 50 min to get a table. So when we got our table, we thought that since we preordered our pizza 45 min ago, it would be ready. But we waited another 45 min while sitting at the table before the pizza came. At first i was excited to finally try the famous chicago deep dish pizza. I love cheese. I was just hungry so first few bites, okay. After a couple bites, it's like chewy cheese on hard crust. The atmosphere is interesting inside the restaurant. Sports jerseys of famous players were framed on the walls."

,,,,,"Needless to say I checked the box with Lou's. Expect to wait. People wait, once your seated things rock and roll. "
,,,,,"Went on a Thursday around 6:30-7pm. Checked in at the host stand, put our name in for a table, told a 45 min wait. Went to the stand next to it and ordered our pizza in advance- we were advised that this is how they do it. This way the pizza has time to cook so you don't have to wait another 40 mins. It's timed with the table seating! Just pizza is preordered everything else is ordered through the waitress at the table. "
,,,,,Then we went to the bar to hang out and had a few beers. Thank god they have a bar. 
,,,,,30 mins later got a text that we were ready!
,,,,,"Seated, drinks, ordered a salad, then the pizzas arrive. For 3 people we got a medium classic and personal of the other go to one. PLENTY OF FOOD. One slice and we were full."

,,,,,I won't ever forget that you left everything you had in DC for Chicago to bridge the physical gap between us. I loved my once every three weeks excursions to the big Illinois city to visit you. You would always plan fun ways to show me around or we'd just keep warm inside and order pizza.
,,,,,Nostrano: 
,,,,,I had my hopes set high for Chicago Deep dish and would have done better at Pizza Hut. No seasoning on ANYTHING. Had to drench my slice in Ranch/Parm/Red peppers to be able to even finish a slice. Wow. Major let down. Only reason this got 2 starts and not 1 was we tried the wings as an app which were amazing. And also the service was amazing as well.
,,,,,Pizza was ok. I've had better. It was just disappointing 0verall. I've had lots of Chicago pizza from neighborhood places and they were a lot better. Don't waste your time with this overrated place.
,,,,,Deep dish pizza really isn't for every pizza lover. I love pizza. But not Lou Malnati pizza. It was my first time having deep dish and I didn't understand the hype. The long line at the door. Or anything. 
,,,,,"3 stars because the service is reaaaaally nice. Also, they let you order your food the same time they put your name down for a table. The pizza takes 40-50 minutes and that's how long the wait is for a table so it makes sense. "
,,,,,The curly fries were bomb. And the guy dressed as a dinosaur giving out the food was hilarious and the highlight of my dinner. 
,,,,,If I were a deep dish pizza lover I'm sure I'd like this place. But I'm not. So I don't. ‍
,,,,,"I thought Lou's Pizza, being all over the city, was something to revere. So much so that I drove everywhere across the greater Chicago area to try the different stores - possibly one was better than the other."
,,,,,"On Lou's Pizza, I didn't find anything worth the trouble. It's basically a flavor-dense disk fried in butter, then covered in too much heavy cheese to make any sense at all. It's basically a handheld casserole of very little flavor. There's no herbs, no richness of tomato, just crusty buttery dough covered in cheese - then veggie, then the meat, and finally the sauce. It's a cheese casserole plain and simple. I even exchanged one just to be sure, and they all taste the same. "
,,,,,Chicago is measuring up to be a pretty disappointing food town - save for Au Cheval. I was so disappointed that this flavor-deaf disk was so popular. I got no words.

,,,,,"We ordered delivery to our hotel. Pizza arrived hot with a layer of plastic wrap on top to make sure the sauce wasn't splattered or crushed by the box. The sauce had great taste, great texture on the crust. It was a Chicago style dee dish but the crust was still very crunchy. And of course plenty of cheese. Only complaint would be that the crust itself didn't have much flavor, but overall very worth it. This was a medium cheese and was plenty for myself, my wife, and her grandmother."
,,,,,"This place is so good!! It's touristy and worth the wait, but I'm so happy I got to try some on my weekend trip to Chicago. The buttery crust is awesome!! (I didn't say it's healthy) "
,,,,,"I got the veggie one, and it was awesome!! "

,,,,,"We went on a Wednesday night, it was decently crowded and about a forty five minute wait. No problem, you can preorder which is convenient. The atmosphere is fun, so it wasn't a bad wait. "
,,,,,We ordered the pizza chips and three dips - I would sell my second born for that garlic dip again. Phenomenal. Hummus was just hummus. Spinach and artichoke dip was pretty good too. 
,,,,,"We ordered a medium pizza - rookie mistake, it was massive. My husband is a big ass dude who can put away some pizza and we barely put a dent in it. We definitely hurt afterwards from trying to eat more than on piece."

,,,,,"Very traditional and epic Chicago deep dish pizza! One of my friends recommended that I try this and Giordano's while there and decide which is better. To be completely honest, they're neck in neck. They don't take reservations but you can join the queue and place your order so it can cut down your wait time to get food for when you're seated..which is a huge help because Chicago deep dish usually takes 45 minutes to prep and service generally. "
,,,,,The small pizza will feed two and I highly recommend their trademark butter crust! They definitely have the best deep dish pizza crust in town (and are less deep than Giordano's). You must try this place in Chicago!!!
,,,,,"Everything was perfection from when I arrived to when I left. The hostesses were all very warm and friendly and offered me a window seat. I ended up moving to the bar (where you have to be 21+ and they ID you if you look under 40) so that I could charge my phone. My waiter, Calvin, provided great service and made sure to check in on me the right amount but not too much.  He was clear about things like coke zero coming from a bottle and the possible wait time for deep dish pizza. I opted for a calamari appetizer which came fast and was very good. The calamari is rings only (no tentacles) and was crispy without too much breading. My personal Lou Malnati's classic was actually more food than I anticipated and after the appetizer, only managed to eat half. It may be that I've only ever had Lou Malnati's for takeout, but having it fresh in the restaurant was the best I'd ever had it. Can't wait to be back!"
,,,,,"The deep dish pizza is our ""go to"" for over 20 years. Pepperoni, onion and mushroom is the very best in the city! The butter crust is delicious!"
,,,,,"We are visiting from out of town and heard this place is a local favorite so we were excited to try. When we walked in, we're weren't really greeted which is fine I guess.. No ""hi"" or ""welcome"" not even a smile LOL. So We asked to order take out and the host/cashier said it was going to be about 30-35 minutes which was fine with us. After 35 minutes I asked if our pizza was almost ready and the host said ""10 more minutes"" so we waited another 10 minutes so I asked again and a different worker came out and said it's gonna be about 25 more minutes.. we were there for almost an hour waiting for a pizza, and mind you it was not busy at all. I'm not sure what was going on that day but no one really helped us out. The host/cashier was rude, I don't know if she was having a bad day or what but she didn't even apologize or acknowledge that they messed something up. And as for the pizza, it was good, nothing great."
,,,,,Lou Malnati's to me is one of Chicago's staple pizzerias. It has an original taste and stands out almond Chicago's other pizza options. It also tastes somewhat healthier and more so on the organic side although it isn't advertised as such--could be because of its consistently fresh ingredients! 10/10 would recommend if you're visiting the city and in the mood for deep dish.
,,,,,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant...the first time in 2019 my fiancé and I were not impressed at all! Not much flavor to the sauce and it didn't seem like much of a deep dish because of how thin the pizza was. Fast forward to today we decided to give it another shot because of all the 5 star reviews and endless google searches of calling ""Lou Malnati's #1""....still not impressed!! Service was especially lacking. We enjoyed the Buffalo wings more than the pizza! Definitely left disappointed and still hungry. Won't be back!"
,,,,,"Uhh... if you want Chicago pizza, you want LOU's!  Hands down.  The best 'za in the city for Chicago deep dish."
,,,,,"Chicago is a pizza dream.  There are plenty of thin crust, NY style, and even pan-places.  That's cool and all.  Those are great too."
,,,,,"But if you want REAL Chicago deep dish, it hast to be Lou's."
,,,,,Surprisingly good!! I say surprisingly because I've never liked Chicago pizza but I realize it's because I never had a legit one!!! I can now say I love Chicago pizza (if it's from Lou's). Super filling so come prepared! 
,,,,,"The flaky crust is delicious, the cheese then goes on top of that, then the sausage patty (literally covers the full surface of pizza), and then the chunky sauce goes on top.  The cheese is so stretchy and goey. Yummmm "
,,,,,The wait can take a bit but easy to order a beer at the bar and wait around. Makes it go by faster.
,,,,,"Service was great but the food was just ok to me. I was kind of disappointed to be honest. The wings tasted just like buffalo wings and there was nothing special that differentiated it from others. The Moscow mule was great and my personal favorite for a hot day in the summer. So refreshing! Onto the pizza, we ordered a personal deep dish pizza because we wanted to try more places in Chicago and didn't want to get too full. There was little flavor in the sauce and was not my favorite. I did eat here once before and got a medium sized pizza and there was more cheese in it so I could see why the personal deep dish sized wouldn't be able to hold that much cheese. Personally my favorite type of pizza is thin crust after eating both deep dish and thin crust. It was kind of disappointing since this place was one of the more famous pizza places in Chicago."
,,,,,"I only gave it 3 stars because the servers were friendly, but their pizza was subpar.  Maybe because I had high expectations from their reviews. I came in at 11am. The place was pretty empty. Ordered a small pizza with sausage and onions.  Waited about 40 minutes for the pizza arrive from my order (as expected). So now here goes my pizza critic: the pizza was not hot, so my cheese wasn't stretching. It was lacking sauce, as there was more cheese than sauce. The crust was hard and bland. Maybe because I didn't order the butter crust, but the it was dry and hard. Tasted like cardboard. Glad we didn't order a larger size."

,,,,,"I ordered the spinach one and my boyfriend ordered the classic one. I preferred the classic one with sausage compared to the spinach one. They were both good and the crust was my favorite part, it tasted like butter! So yummy! We ordered the personal size that way we could try each other's and still finish everything, which we did. "

,,,,,No contact delivery is fabulous!
,,,,,"If it was based on the deep dish pizza alone, Lou Malnati's would get a 3 for me. Despite this place being the OG and most popular deep dish spot in Chicago, I just wasn't too fond of it. For two, we ordered The Lou in small ($18.25) and the Trio of Dips and Pizza Chips ($10.50). I'd definitely recommend an appetizer since the deep dish takes about 45 minutes."
,,,,,"The trio of dips and pizza chips was the absolute best decision ever. Get this, you won't regret it! (Actually, your stomach might regret it when you need to unbutton those pants) But seriously, this appetizer is what I'd give Lou Malnati's a 5 stars for! The crispy pizza chip were like a soft pita chip that held all the dips very well. They were all topped with its own herbs, spices, and chopped tomatoes too. But the real winners here are these dips: roasted garlic, artichoke, and giardiniera-topped hummus. Wow, each of them were so delicious and flavored with my favorite being the artichoke dip for sure. I was honestly satisfied just having this dip and chips already."
,,,,,"As for the deep dish pizza, the Lou was a combination of spinach mix, mushrooms, and sliced roma tomatoes covered with blend of mozzarella, romano, and cheddar cheese on garlic buttercrust. I think the veggie toppings were not exactly my favorite choice, especially with sliced tomatoes on top so I was already a bit put off. As a cheese lover, I found that the cheese was too excessive and stringy as well. I only had one slice and had to call it quits."
,,,,,"When it comes to deep dish pizza in Chicago, everyone has their own preference and favorites. Lou Malnati's has the most simple menu with a more cheesy factor in theirs over the rest of them. But for what it's worth, I'd totally come back for the trio of dips and pizza chips!"
,,,,,Next pizza ever! Love it so much that I order it and have it mailed to Michigan!
,,,,,"THIS WAS THE BEST PIZZA EVER. I didn't know that Lou Malnati was a chain pizza restaurant. I thought it was going to be a pizza take-out. But no, it's a sit down."
,,,,,"The Malnati Chicago Class. Small. Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra cheese and vint-ripened tomato sauce on butter crust. We ordered a size small and each of us had a quarter of a pizza. The pizza was so thick! One quarter of a deep dish pizza was enough to make all of us full! The crust was so thick and crispy and crunch. The pizza was full of cheese. There were large pieces of sausage in there. The tomatoes were really fresh! Our waitress told us that the way to eat deep dish pizza was to eat with a knife and a fork. And so we did!"

,,,,,Best pizza I have ever had!! Travelled from Houston to Chicago and was excited to land and make my way to Lous. Crust is the best!!
,,,,,Nice staff.  Tried the Chicago Malnati pizza.  Very cheesy and just okay.  Crust was very buttery.  Interior was very nice with lots of seating options.  Easy half mile walk from The Drake Hotel.  Ended up giving my 3/4 pizza leftovers to homeless along walk back to hotel as wasn't my favorite.  Think I prefer Gino's East pizza better.  Granted for Chicago style pizza I've heard both Lou Malnati's and Gino's are very popular.  Even though it wasn't my favorite pizza it was a pleasant experience and would recommend trying a Chicago style pizza if in the area.

,,,,,"Began the night disappointed with the overall service provided. We ordered prior to being seated and did not receive confirmation of seating, so we made our way back to the hostess who informed us that there where some availability. Thereafter, our server neglected us which resulted in me having to speak to the hostess about getting service. I would have left but the food was incredible. The deep dish hit the mark and the calamari was crunchy and moist. The deep dish pizza was savory, salty, and the crust was made perfect to the crunch. I was incredibly impressed as I wanted to give this restaurant a negative rating for the service. However, Jose made up for his mistakes and picked up after realizing we were neglected.I would return even though I was shown no courtesy initially. The food speaks for itself and well worth it. Would highly recommend the deep dish pizza and calamari."
,,,,,Deep dish is savory and rich slices are really big . The thin is my favorite can't miss with either choice . Service is always good too.

,,,,,Lou's is the best deep dish in town. Why? The crust. The crust is second to none for deep dish Chicago pizza. Can't really go wrong with topping choices. 
,,,,,"The crust is better than the competition so if you want to try a Chicago deep dish and have to choose one, then choose Lou's. Hands down what most Chicagoans prefer."
,,,,,"Came here for lunch on our last day in Chicago and we were not dissapointed. I had been to another location, but this one was a bit better. They crisped the pizza perfectly here and it was extra cheesy. We ordered the classic deep dish, but also ordered a pepperoni thin crust which was also really good. To satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered their chocolate chip pizza which was so darn good. It was a chocolate chip cookie cooked in the deep dish pan, topped with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream (please note this is enough to share between 2-3 people). Overall, our experience was good and I would return to this place without a doubt."
,,,,,You must have a deep dish when visiting chicago.  You just must.  This is my favorite location to obtain the need for deep dish when in Chicago.  Place is super old school yet managed great.  You can put your name down and via a text be notified when your table is ready.  They also recommend you order your pizza so they can have it in the oven before you are seated to cut down the wait time.  Food tastes great.
,,,,,"First of all, be prepared for a long wait as this restaurant is always packed and even more so on weekends. "

He finally came to our table and we told him that there wasn't any pepperoni on it. He returned with his small notebook and said he didn't write it down. Instead of being apologetic for not taking the correct order, he made it seem that it was our fault that he didn't write it down and walked away. RUDE!!"
,,,,,"A very busy place. We came during what seemed like the busiest time of day (5p). You can preorder your pizza while you wait. When they call your name for a table, your pizza is started. The pizza making process takes about 30 min after its put in, so you don't have too long to wait once you're seated. We came here twice and we sat at the bar the first time. Each experience was great! The bar atmosphere was friendly and really busy. It's like being behind the scenes where all the action is."
,,,,,"The personal size is the perfect amount. My husband ordered a medium on our first visit thinking it would perfectly appease his appetite. Lo and behold his appetite was quenched with just one deep dish slice! Since we were in a hotel, we donated the remaining pizza to a very excited man in our way home. Everyone ate well that night. "
,,,,,We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and we obviously liked it because we were there twice during our short visit. So if you want to try some great Chicago deep dish look no further.
,,,,,The deep dish pizza with giardinera is the bomb! The Malnatis salad makes for a great side with blue cheese and bacon crumbles. You just can't beat the Lou's rich tomato sauce.
,,,,,Excellent service by Susan. Food was delicious. The namesake salad was delicious. I don't usually eat mushrooms but I loved this salad. The pizza was as great as the review said.
,,,,,"Excellent deep dish pizza!  This is my favorite Chicago deep dish pizza chain out of the major competitors (Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, Giordano's).  The pizza is saucy and the crust is delicious.  "
,,,,,"Just note that, like all deep-dish pizzas, the preparation time is quite long (30+ minutes).  You should definitely place an order ahead of time or be prepared to wait."
,,,,,"Smack dab in the middle of great restos in the River North,  Lou Malnati's (many branches in Chi-town and the burbs) does not suffer from a lack of a loyal following.  It helps that social media has elevated LM to star status and you'll see the throngs here: local and visitor.  After having eaten Lou Malnati's pizza for over 8 years, Ive gotten to feel the love maybe too many times,  but I still like it.  It's not my favorite deep dish pie and it's not the best in Chicago.  It's super popular though, crowded so plan for a 3 hour event. This time I tried something different which is to add sausage (made exclusively for LM) and jalapeño to their veggie pie and loved it ....immensely.  "
,,,,,"I like their distinctive cracker-crisp butter crust and their pies that hold an ungodly amount of cheese.  So if you don't like a typical pan/deep thick  crust you'll like this pie.  For a lactose intolerant person, I sure can plunge into a cheese  laden pizza like this without blinking. The flavors are solid, the sauce distinctly Malnati, not sweet but bold.  "
,,,,,You'd think after all this success LM would get it together with reservations management. 
,,,,,"If ya cant wait or live cross country and are craving LM pie, you can order online in packs of 2, 4 and 6.  They also carry a crustless pizza, (for the low carb crowd)  they place a sausage disk at the bottom of the pan instead of their classic crust.   I've tried the spinach mailed and it was really good.  "
,,,,,Thanks to Lady Tess of Yelp for the link:  
,,,,,Tip:   There's a long wait and people do.  There's no Yelp waitlist. They need to get it together because families with kids wait up to 1.5 hours daily.  Best time to come is when they first open or after 9pm.
,,,,,"I'll start off by saying, the wait is real at Malnati's! I arrived at quarter to 8pm on a Wednesday night needing just a seat for me. There was a 30 minute wait. Their process is innovative where you place your pizza order first while you wait, and by the time you're seated your pizza should be ready because of the long cooking process of the crust and pizza. "
,,,,,"I ordered a personal pizza and the chicken Marsala pasta. I am no deep dish conneissour, but the previous restaurant that I tried deep dish, I was not impressed. So, if I didn't like the pizza here, at least I'd be able to enjoy the pasta. I will say that $10.75 for a personal size pizza is a bit ridiculous as this is football stadium pricing, but that pretty much seems to be the norm. The personal pizza was good, better than the first I had at a competitor, but def not enough for dinner... more like an appetizer or snack. So IMO, even as one person for dinner I'd order a small pizza. The pasta on the other hand was loaded with chicken and mushrooms and super filling! Thankfully the chicken breast was cut up unlike other Marsalas where you're given the full breast. "

Chicago deep dish is somewhat of a cult classic with a cult following to rival it. Our wait for Lou Malnati's was 2 and a half hours long, in which we went for a walk, some shopping... it was long to be fair, and still undecided if it was worth it or not since there's lots of delicious deep dish in the city. However, the pizza we had was absolutely delicious and I would go again in a heartbeat, but maybe not for 2.5 hour wait again.  A must try if you're into deep dish pizza or want to try some classic Chi-town pie!"

The manager came to apologize, personally, with free deserts in hand and they even gave us a discount for that inconvenience. Also, Zach was phenomenal. The food tasted delicious!!! We got the family Cesar salad with chicken, very well done Buffalo traditional wings, & lemon pepper traditional wings. Do not hesitate to come here."
,,,,,"Ordered two pizzas for to be ready for pickup at 7:30. At 7:45 they told us there was a mistake and one of the pizzas had to be ""remade"", taking 20-25 minutes. At 8:05, they told us a mistake had been made again and the pizza would take another 20-25 to be ready, when it finally came out at 8:35.

,,,,,My favorite Pizza! Get the original thin crust for your first time ordering. Delivery is really fast too and easy to order.
,,,,,The best deep dish in Chicago! I love just the plain cheese and tomato but have enjoyed the sausage as well. The frozen pizzas are a great gift and bake well at home as a bonus.

,,,,,First off I do not read other comments so that it will never reflect in my own.
,,,,,"Now lets get the the nitty gritty, visiting Chicago from New York for the first time has caused me to look up the best pizza in Chicago. I came across this pizzeria where upon entering I was met with great customer service. A female by the name of Janine assisted me with my order and ensured that no more than i needed would be ordered. My son and I tried the bruschetta and personal pan cheese pizza for two. The bruschetta was very good however, the pizza was absolutely DELICIOUS. I am from NY and when visiting other destinations I try to food especially pizza. This restaurant has upped the standards when it comes to pizza outside of NY. I could never have imagined the brushetta let alone the PIZZA tasted so spectacular. It is a little pricey however, the price is commensurate with the level of satisfaction you will receive when trying to the food."
,,,,,"So, I urge you try this location and try the pizza. I give it a 10/10. Now I know why Chicago says their pizza is better than NY. With these ingredients this restaurant beats 9/10 pizzerias in NY."
,,,,,"Came here our first night in Chicago. The area was pretty quiet considering it was a Saturday night. There was a line to check in and the process was pretty easy, you give your name and number and how many in your party and they give you a wait time. Then the check in lady had us go in and preorder the pizza you want. We came in expecting to wait so that wasn't really an issue for us. We waited about an hour and a half before they text us that our table was ready. Since they text you there is NO REASON for you to be waiting inside the restaurant and we were baffled at how many people were inside when we got in there. Trying to find the spot to check back in was difficulty because of the amount of people that were crowded around for no actual reason."
,,,,,Once we were seated our waitress was great! We order drinks and an appetizer (3 cheese bread) because we were starving by that point. The bread was delicious. Took another 20 minutes for our pizza to arrive which was also delicious. Best part was the sausages. Left full and happy. Only complaint we had was their system. It's almost dangerous how many people were crowded in their waiting. It wasn't cold outside or raining or snowing so most could have taken a walk instead of hanging out like it was going to make time go faster

,,,,,"Lou Malnati's is such a Chicago staple and you can't go wrong with them. Deep dish, thin crust, it all tastes great. Just keep in mind, deep dish pizzas generally take 40 minutes minimum to make after you place your order. So if you're eating in the restaurant, it could be 40-60 minutes after you order until you get to eat. We typically only order deep dish for delivery and it's best to order straight from the restaurant for the best/fastest service. The portions they recommend for the size of your party are spot on. Even on an empty stomach, most people are not going to be able to eat more than one or two slices of deep dish pizza. Generally, for two people, we order a medium deep dish pizza, eating two slices each, and still have a couple slices left over. We opt for the low-fat mozzarella cheese with sausage and pepperoni for toppings. They had a promo for free chicken wings this past weekend, so we ordered some honey bbq wings. They were OK, but probably wouldn't order them in the future. Considering they were free, still a 10/10 experience. Of course there are endless options when it comes to deep dish pizza, but I definitely recommend Lou Malnati's or Giordano's to people visiting the city! Pequod's and Art of Pizza are a close second."
,,,,,"My husband and I love our pizza, and this may have been our favorite EVER! It's worth the 30 minute wait for the delicious deep dish pizza. We ordered the three cheese bread while we waited and it was good, but The Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza was amazing!"

,,,,,Pizza:
,,,,,"We ordered a medium Classic and a medium Lou's. Firstly, too much food (never thought I would say that) for 4 people even though we were all pretty hungry. The taste of the pizza was good, but not great. I felt like both lacked flavor and (don't reprimand me!) had way too much cheese. At one point, my crust was about an inch thick and sauce was only about 1/8"". That just didn't sit right with me."

,,,,,"The pizza was quite disappointing, but the Malnati Salad was seriously amazing. Probably the BEST salad I've ever had. A family portion costs you about $15, so it's pricey but very worth it.

,,,,,We had a great late lunch today at Lou Malnati's! The staff was friendly and welcoming. We felt totally safe being there and everything was socially distanced. The food was so good! We got the wings appetizer and the Malnati salad to start with. Both were really good with excellent flavors. We then had the Malnati's original deep dish pizza which was really good as well! Definitely recommend this spot! I just wish their Michigan Ave location had been open.
,,,,,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm to try some Chicago pizza since I'm not from the area. Luckily the wait wasn't bad when we came, and we were seated after 5 minutes. However, their pizzas do take roughly 45 minutes to make, so even if you are seated immediately, you will still have a bit of a wait. At times when there is no immediate seating available, they let you pre-order your pizza so that you'll have less of a wait once you are seated."
,,,,,"We ordered The Lou size small to share between 2 people. I felt this was a good amount of food to leave us feeling satisfied, but with a little room left over in case we wanted to try out some snacks in the city. Since The Lou does not have any meat on it, we also added the chicken sausage as a topping. I really enjoyed my slices and felt that the topping flavors worked really well together. I usually do not enjoy pizza crusts but I finished all my crusts. "
,,,,,"For anyone who wants to try Chicago pizza, this is the place to go. Just be prepared for a bit of a wait. I do wish the pizzas came out a little faster but I understand that they make them fresh so it does take some time. This probably isn't the best place to go if you just want a quick bite or if you're on a time crunch...you should probably plan for at least an hour and a half here (probably 2-2.5 hours on weekends and during peak hours)"

,,,,,Unfortunately this pizza just went very good. We go The Lou and it just didn't have much flavor and wasn't quite deep dish and definitely wasn't thin crust. The crust was very bland. The cookie pie dessert was phenomenal but super small so that was disappointing!

,,,,,"When I lived in Chicago, Lou Malnati's was one of my go-tos for deep dish pizza. I didn't order it often but a few times a year I went all in and got a cheesy pie to indulge in. So, when my husband and I were in town this past weekend and we decided to do dinner in our hotel room I suggested Lou's. A great call!"
,,,,,"Deep dish takes a long time to bake so it took about an hour for delivery, which I thought it was actually pretty reasonable for a Saturday night. They came right to our hotel lobby and we went down and picked it up. When we brought it up to our room it was still hot and just as good as I remembered it."
,,,,,"FYI-- they don't supply plates or silverware with delivery. They may have been able to if we called in the order but with an online order it wasn't an option. I anticipated this, however, and got some from the hotel, so it wasn't an issue at all."
,,,,,"Dudes. I don't understand how the system here works. Well... I do now, but it is absolute CHAOS. So, you put your name down on the waitlist with the hostess who will give you an approximate wait time (and you'll wanna double the number they give you, by the way). You'll need to expect a text from them, after which you'll have 5 minutes to check in at the ""Text message"" section. Now, right after you put your name down on the waitlist, you should get in the other line to pre-order pizza so that it's ""ready"" for you once you sit down. I'm not really sure how much time this saves you since once we finally sat down at the table, our server said the pizza was still not ready."
,,,,,"Anyway, the food was good! I was actually surprised how good the thin crust was. Not super impressed with the deep dish pizza, though. Feel like I've had better in SF, to be honest. "
,,,,,"Overall, glad that we came while we were in Chicago. But we definitely won't be back."
,,,,,"If you're a tourist wondering if you should come, I would say look elsewhere. Don't really think it's worth it."

,,,,,"I enjoyed the evening at the restaurant due to the company I was there with, which made up for the subpar service I felt we received."
,,,,,"Sadly the gluten free deep dish I was desperate to try was undercooked/raw. The cosmo was good though, hence the two stars!"
,,,,,I am from the NYC/NJ area so I can be biased oh what I think pizza should be like. I got the sausage deep dish (with sausage pieces) and just wasn't into it. The sauce was ok but it's just too much dough for me. One piece of this and I am all set. I'll stick to my thin crust pizza which I hear Chicago has a decent amount of. I hear this is the best place to go though if you want the classic deep dish Chicago pizza
,,,,,"I was recommended this spot for the best Chicago pizza, and I have to say I was very impressed. I showed up 20 minutes before closing and was treated with so much enthusiasm. Excellent service, excellent pizza, will be back next time I visit Chicago!"

,,,,,"My friend recommended this place to me for deep dish pizza. While I enjoyed the pizza, I wanted to talk about the overall experience waiting in line."
,,,,,"Arriving around 6:45pm, our wait was 45-60minutes long. You can pre-order the pizza you want first though other menu items will have to wait until you are seated. There are seats outside you can sit and wait in. Around 7:50pm, we were seated. I ordered the minestrone soup and our pizzas were expected to arrive in ~15 more minutes. Our waiter informed us pizzas take 45 minutes to make so it was good we pre-ordered while waiting in line. A couple next to us didn't pre-order and had to decide whether they wanted to be seated for an additional 45 minutes. These are things to keep in mind when coming here! "
,,,,,"We ordered the ""Lou"" and ""Chicago"" in a personal dish (feeds 1). The Lou had a lot more vegetables and was sorta breaking apart the pizza due to the juices in the tomato. The Chicago was meatier with loads of sausage. Both pizzas were cut in half, though I'd prefer it to be cut in fourths. I tried a bit of both but I prefer the Lou more because of how many vegetables there are in it. I ordered the minestrone soup in a cup rather than a bowl, but because the waiter forgot to include it in the order, I received the minestrone soup at the end of my meal in a bowl--very kind of her to do so. It also came with two saltine crackers, my favorite!"
,,,,,"Deep dish pizza isn't my favorite, but it is a delicacy native to Chicago and it's a must-try. I enjoyed Lou Malnati's because every pizza is handmade and represented well in a popular area (near the Magnificent Mile.)"
,,,,,Carry Out Review:
,,,,,Worth the hype! I ordered carry out for the classic and sat at home and enjoyed every bite! Perfectly cooked and seasoned and cheesy. The crust was perfect. I will be going back for more meals! I was happy to see that quality wasn't compromised bc this place was packed when I went to pick up.  
,,,,,Be prepared to wait even if you ordered carry out. This place is obviously very popular!
,,,,,"I like this place more than last time I came (7 years ago!)... Maybe cause I'm older now and don't want too much cheese. Felt the pizza was just the right depth... good protein, cheese, crust ratio. Also the crust was delicious. "
,,,,,Ordered 2 pizzas to bring back to NJ. Price wasn't bad at $16 for a 9 inch. Turned out well in the oven... almost as good as restaurant. Note though that the crust is different to the restaurant version.
,,,,,"I've been to Lou's, Giordanos, Uno, Due and Gino's East. "
,,,,,"Of the above, Giordanos is the best, but Lou's has to be my least favorite (although it was still decent). "
,,,,,"When I get ""deep dish"" pizza, I want it to be DEEP, but Lou's is relatively shallow. "
,,,,,I liked the sausage base though.
,,,,,"Oh what a pizza pie it is.    We live in Minneapolis but order Lou Malnatis pizza online.   This is classic Chicago Pizza.   We had a seminar with Lou's and I learned we build our pizza backward.  Put the cheese down and then the sauce.  The cheese helps protect the crust.   Also, hit the pizza pan with a little oil and once it's hot out the oizza dough in and it will give it a crispy crust.   "
,,,,,These are hallmarks of the pizza.  Order a box of six and you can have Lou's anytime!   Our favorites are cheese and sausage.  Cost is roughly the same as if you ordered takeout.    Love this pizza!   
,,,,,"I ordered Veggie Pizza ( Green Bell Peppers , Mushrooms , Green Onion ) . It was amazing  ."
,,,,,The moment I had my first bite it was pure love . The marinara sauce was fantastic. It was like it was made just now by blending the tomatoes.
,,,,,The taste of cheese was also amazing. 
,,,,,The overall review is the best deep dish pizza I ever had.
,,,,,Update:   Lou's has reached out and made this more than right.  Kudos to them for doing their customers right.   
,,,,,"Was excited to get some Chicago pizzas as a gift while social distancing out of town....   What I actually got was a mess.   Sorry, but the topping shouldn't all be on one side.   Both crustless pizzas arrived like that.  The regular crust pizzas arrived in good shape.  Huge let down"
,,,,,"This place is really hyped up, but failed to meet expectations. Garlic bread was hard and crusty, mozzarella sticks weren't hot enough and cheese didn't have the melted cheese it should have; it was tough. The pizza was most disappointing. Tried the Malnati and the pizza was thin, not very deep and the sauce was not that great. I have had better deep dish pizza in San Fransisco and they are not even known for pizzas smh. We asked for no whole tomatoes and they still put them in. Not worth the wait at all. Giordianos is WAY better. Two people and we quit on the first slice each."

,,,,,The decor in Lou Malnati's Pizzeria was really traditional and classical American style dinner. It would remind you of some famous scene in movies since it's a historical restaurant. 
,,,,,I am not a fan for pizza and this was my first time to try deep dish style. The deep dish pizza is totally different from other pizza and I fell in love with it right after I tried.
,,,,,We got the Classic and the Lou and the best parts were the heavy cheese inside and the crispy *dish*. We also tried their fried platter but it was not as surprised as pizza.
,,,,,I traveled to this location for one of the best mouth watering Chicago pizza ! There is nothing like Chicago pizza and this is one of the best there is! The deep dish crust is delicious ! The sausage is authentic Italian patties!

,,,,,"Once your table is ready, you check-in at the hostess station.  Once seated, you can order drinks and anything else from the menu.  It was another 15-20 minutes before our foods came out.  "

,,,,,Overall: will return! Great pizza. Great selections to choose from. Easy pick for pizza place!
,,,,,"I chose to visit Malnati's for the history and I had only heard rave reviews prior to dining here myself. It's a larger chain but I would say that you don't feel that way upon entering. Very reminiscent of any nicely decorated and cozy local Italian eatery. At this particular venue, I received great service, and everything was very clean.  "
,,,,,"Keep in mind, this is my first and only experience with deep dish pizza (West Coaster here) but I have to say that I thought it was delicious. Being from the thin crust coast, it almost isn't like pizza. It's kind of it's own amazing entree.... but in Chicago this is what pizza is meant to be!"

,,,,,"Chicago Deep Pizza is superb, and the Malnati Salad is like no other."
,,,,,"What to say that hasn't been said already? We knew we had to try deep-dish during our visit to Chicago, and Lou Malnati was the place. The pizza does take a while, but the apps come out quickly! The pizza itself was delicious: great toppings, and that buttercrust. So good!"
,,,,,"My wife and I flew into Chicago on a Friday evening. After checking in at Aloft Mag Mile, we were absolutely starving (all we got were snacks on our Southwest flight from San Diego)."
,,,,,"I knew the solution to our starvation situation: Chicago deep-dish pizza. But not just any Chicago deep-dish pizza -- I wanted the best. So, we jumped in an Uber and made our way to Lou Malnati's River North."
,,,,,Best. Decision. Ever.
,,,,,"When we arrived at almost 10pm, it was still packed. We got our names on the waiting list for a table and ordered our pizza right then and there. We opted for the The Lou, which is a meat-free combination of spinach, garlic, basil, onion, mushrooms, and sliced Roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on a garlic deep-dish buttercrust. My wife and I avoid eating meat whenever possible, so we were happy to see this option on the menu."
,,,,,More on that in a bit.
,,,,,"After waiting about 20 minutes for a table, a couple left their seats at the bar and I immediately snagged them. The good news is that you can order food at the bar and get all the drinks you would ever want. Our bartender was super friendly and attentive. My wife had a glass of wine, I had a local craft beer, and we ordered a caesar salad to gnaw on while we waited for our pizza. The salad was excellent -- fresh and well-dressed."
,,,,,"About 60 minutes after we originally ordered it (we had ordered another round of drinks in the meantime), our pizza arrived and it was simply stunning. So cheesy, so garlicky, so damn tasty. Every bite was an explosion of flavor -- a revelation. I've eaten a lot of pizza at a lot of places over the years, including Italy, and this was easily in the top-3 ever.  Perhaps the very best."
,,,,,"Despite our best efforts, we were able to finish only about half of our pizza. That turned out to be a good thing when we had it for breakfast in our hotel room during our last day in town."
,,,,,"If we ever get to Chicago again, Lou Malnati's will definitely be on our to-do list. An easy five stars!"
,,,,,"Seems that visitors in Chicago go for Lou Malnati's and Giordano's for their deep dish fix. Admittedly I'm not big on deep dish, but thankfully Lou does thin crust pizzas and amazing salads too. This location is a super crowded one so expect to wait at least half an hour for dinner. There are 2 floors with lots of tables and they have a nice waitlisting system: you get text updates when your table is ready and you can order before being seated!"
,,,,,"For food, we got the Classic & the Lou. Not a big fan of the Classic since it was so heavy but LOVED the Lou (spinach & mushroom helped with the heaviness of the cheese). Service was a little scattered and inattentive but likely since it's busy."
,,,,,"This place does not do deep dish pizza justice. If this is your first exposure to deep dish, you will have a poor impression of it. This is my second deep dish pizza attempt and I have to say, Lou Malnati's did not deliver. Very doughy on the bottom. Not crispy at all. Not delicious. "
,,,,,"Service here is INCREDIBLY slow. Yes I know the pizza takes an hour to cook. But it shouldn't take 20 minutes for someone to give us glasses of water. It shouldn't take another 20 minutes to get beer order. These people are working hard, but the service here is still incredibly slow. "

,,,,,"One word: redemption.  While in town recently, I realized that a friend (that was leaving in mere hours) had never had Chicago pizza.  That just wouldn't do.  Based on where we were and how much time before she scooted out of town, we made our way to Lou Malnati's.  Funny thing is that I didn't even remember that this is where I'd had a less than stellar pizza pie experience.  "
,,,,,"We got in just before the true dinner rush (thank goodness).  We were able to order our pizzas from the hostess stand while we waited on our table.  Brilliant to minimize wait times on the pizza! We shared the Malnati salad while we waited on our pizzas.  It was delicious.  The veggies tasted fresh the contrast of salty salami and the bit of the gorgonzola dressing were a match made in heaven.  Our pizzas arrived shortly after we finished with our salad.  It was hot and melty and exactly what my tastebuds needed!  I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic (Made with Lou's lean sausage, some extra mozzarella cheese and vine-ripened tomato sauce on Buttercrust) and added pepperoni, onions, and black olives.  It was the perfect combination!  The crust was flaky and truly buttery. It has the perfect amount of sauce and the additional toppings were just the right flavor combo.  "
,,,,,TL;DR: I'm not mad at Lou Malnati's anymore.
,,,,,This was such a disappointing experience. A trip to chicago requires deep dish pizza. All that ooey-gooey cheesy goodness!  It's the stuff dreams are made of! Amiright!? 
,,,,,"When your salivating pizza desires are crushed with mediocre pizza, it can nearly send you into a depressing downward spiral. That might be a bit dramatic, but only slightly. "
,,,,,"Let's start with the crust. I feel like Chicago pizza crust has hopes and dreams of stardom, but our crust somehow settled for middle management in a polo shirt. "
,,,,,"Our pizza lacked saucy goodness that demands you eat it with a fork and knife. If asked I'll deny this, but I actually picked it up in my hand and ate it like a regular piece of pizza. Gasp!!! "
,,,,,"This is merely speculation, but I am pretty sure our pizza was frozen. We ordered a sausage, pepperoni, onion, and green pepper pie. Our server said it would take extra time to cook with the extras on it. We didn't care. (We're wild and crazy) When our pizza arrived the pepperoni, onion, and peppers were cooked on top and the sausage inside. The sausage itself was one thin patty and the diameter of the pizza. It was weird, to say the least. "
,,,,,"Such a let down. If you are looking for good pizza, you can do so much better. Skip the touristy chains and go for the real deal!!!"
,,,,,Best pizza in Chicago. I recommend dipping it in a side of ranch.
,,,,,Who needs to visit this institution when they ship pies all over! We got two shipped to NJ. Everything you need to know how to bake it delicious golden is on the label. Probably the best deep dish I've ever had. Very fresh and excellent ingredients.
,,,,,Support local & small business!
,,,,,Came here on our first night in town. We placed a phone order and was told it be about 30-40 mins. We showed up at the 40 mins mark but still had to wait about another 10 mins.
,,,,,We ordered a large deep pizza and salad...total cost was about $55. The salad was good and the dressing was tasty. The deep dish pizza was also good and right up there with some of the other competitors. Nothing to really set them apart from the millions of other pizza places however our Lyft driver did say her favorite here is the thin crust pizza so I hope to try that next time.
,,,,,I was finishing up a day of work at the Merchandise Mart and wanted to grab some dinner before hopping the late train back to Milwaukee.
,,,,,My friend suggested Lou Malnati's. 
,,,,,"I had never had deep dish pizza in Chicago (I've had it elsewhere), so I figured it was about time."
,,,,,"You put your name on the list (they text you when your table is ready) and they'll hand you menus to peruse. Once you've decided on your order, there's a separate counter at which to place order prior to being seated. That way, once seated, other than your drink order, your order has already been taken."
,,,,,"It's a bit convoluted, but does streamline things and is probably helpful for the kitchen to get your order ASAP."
,,,,,I went for their classic with pepperoni added on their signature butter crust. 
,,,,,"It was rich and amazing. The six inch is plenty of food. Realistically, I was pretty full half way through. But, deliciousness spurred me to finish the whole lot. "
,,,,,Get to it!
,,,,,"I will fight you- this is the best deep dish AND thin crust in Chicago. It's great fresh, frozen, in the morning, afternoon, or evening. I dare you to name a better deep dish pizza."
,,,,,"It would've been a 5star. First time going there. Food was great. The pizza was fantastic but a personal pizza, calamari and 2 glasses of beer are not worth $93.59."

When I asked about the wait, the hostess realized she put the wrong area code and we jumped to the top of the list. "
,,,,,"Once seated, our waitress confirmed our orders and 20 min later our fresh hot just-made pizzas arrived!! They were everything Chicago style pizza should be: loads of toppings and cheese, deep-dish butter crust, lots of garlic and plenty of sauce. "

,,,,,"Waited about :40 for a deep dish Malnati's classic overflowing with sausage and with a buttery flaky crust. So good and totally satisfying. After ordering and eating some super tender calamari, we could only eat a couple of pieces each and took the rest on the road when we drove to Detroit. It was that good."

,,,,,"This review is on their mail order pizzas.  We ordered the 6 pack recently. Delivery went smoothly and was quick. They arrived flash frozen and ready to cook.  The only negative things are, they are expensive for what you get. Toppings, especially sauce, kind of skimpy. But the worst part of the experience was they were so freakin salty.  Geez guys.  Not sure what you are trying to achieve with the salt, but that part was horrible. There is potential.  But honestly, the pizzas we received look nothing like the pictures of pizza for in person dining.  Those pics show generous toppings and 3X more sauce than on the frozen pizzas.  Why when you are charging about $20 a frozen pizza? Reduce the salt, add a little more sauce and toppings, and they would be really good frozen pizzas.  But I dont think I will be buying them again unless I hear from someone changes were made. Honestly, there are better frozen pizzas for a much lower price."
,,,,,"Just moved to Chicago and LOVED this pizza. Definitely some of the best since I have been here. The Lou's is amazing and has the best crust. We have ordered from there about 3 times and it is as good as the last, even is better!"
,,,,,"So disappointed! Visiting Chicago, my husband and I carefully did our research to see where we could get the best deep dish. While competition seemed neck and neck we finally decided on Lou Malnati's to try the famous crust. We weren't surprised there was a wait (I think on a Friday afternoon we waited about 90mins). Luckily the system is very efficient, so we ordered our pizzas ahead of time and waited at a nearby Joe and the Juice. "
,,,,,"When we were finally seated, we received our salads and then pizza. Service was quick and nice. The salad wasn't bad, the dressing was yummy. Finally...the pizza arrived and we couldn't wait to dig in. We thought the first bite was nothing to write home about and kept eating, hoping to taste the what made this place so amazing for others. While we did enjoy the crust, the cheese and sauce was seriously lacking. The sauce I think was the worst, zero flavor and almost watery. "

Me & my husband got 2 personal pizzas and it was the perfect amount for us. I got the Lou & he got the Chicago Classic! Both we're good but we both enjoyed the Lou more. We also added sausage to the Lou."
,,,,,Delicious pizza! Salads just meh. Busy so check in on their website before going! Order your pizza while you're waiting for your table!
,,,,,"So my Fiancé and I came to Chicago for a wedding. Chicago is my FAVORITE city outside of places I've lived. I got some history here. This visit was my fourth one but my first one since I started making a list of restaurants I've seen on various television shows such as ""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives,"" ""Food Paradise"" and others. ""Food Wars,"" which actually doesn't come on anymore, showcased Lou's and Pizzeria Uno so I made sure to check out both on this latest journey to the Windy City. First stop on the deep dish tour: Lou Malnati's."
,,,,,"I enjoyed both places but Lou Malnati's was a little better to me because I enjoyed their crust more. It was tastier and didn't fall apart with all of that heavy, deep dish action on top of it like my pizza from Pizzeria Uno's did. My Baby and I got some cheese bread from here as an appetizer and it was spectacular. Cheese bread is one of those simple dishes that doesn't always get prepared with the proper love and respect it deserves but Lou's did just that."
,,,,,"If you ever get a chance, search YouTube for the ""Food Wars"" episode on deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's edged out Pizzeria Uno's and while both are excellent, I agree with their decision."
,,,,,We were expecting to be disappointed since we had never tried deep dish pizza before but didn't know how we felt about it....
,,,,,TURNS OUT ITS AMAZING!!!!
,,,,,I gave four stars because the wait for a pizza is 35-45 minutes however our experience with the pizza itself was a 5 star. 
,,,,,We got the personal size deep dish cheese pizza and added chicken sausage. It was amazing. Very flavorful and cooked just right. Service and staff (although we were switched to 3 different waiters) was exceptional as well.

,,,,,"I can't complain about the pizza.  It was definitely really good.  The service was reasonably attentive-- especially given how busy they were-- and they seemed to have a lot of personnel (taking orders, directing guests, cleaning tables, etc) The mozzarella sticks were your usual faire but the marinara was very good.  I think what was troublesome/irksome was just how overrun they were."
,,,,,"I'm happy they are so popular and busy, but it's Chicago, surely there is more than one great deep dish pizza place?  Or does everyone just go to the top result on Yelp?  "
,,,,,"Busy is one thing, but here they check you in so they can txt you and then you are required to go order your pizza(s) (only) at this other hostess station-- which had 3 people taking orders, presumably to speed along your dining experience.  When they buzz you, they tape a print out to your menu so your server knows about your pizza order and then takes the rest of your order.... I guess 5 stars for efficiency and table-flipping but it didn't make the experience terribly enjoyable or memorable-- unless perhaps waiting for your deep dish is something you'd prefer not to do? Next time, I'm definitely trying some place farther down the list of deep dish pizza places!"
,,,,,No trip to Chicago is complete without a Lou's pizza. We're enjoying the bar watching football waiting on friends. Then the good stuff. The amazing Lou's pizza. Glad to be back.
,,,,,Every trip to Chicago includes a trip to Lou's. Have been coming here for years and it's always over the top good. The pizza is uniquely different from NY pizza. It's in a class all it's own. Definitely worth trying. You won't be disappointed.
,,,,,"If you're visiting Chicago you have to try the pizza here. Seriously, one of the best pizzas I've had, ever.  I had the Garlic Parmesan wings and sausage deep dish pie and it was delicious. When I return to Chicago I'll definitely becoming back. Service was awesome too!"
,,,,,It was good but not amazing.
,,,,,"Coming to Chicago, there were two things I was determined to try: deep-dish pizza and a Chicago-style hot dog."
,,,,,"I ended up getting a small ""The Lou,"" which is basically your super cheesy version of a veggie deep dish. I definitely liked the buttery and super crunchy crust. As for the toppings and sauce themselves, they were all super flavorful. The toppings were many. But I'm not sure if I was blown away. I sadly thought that the deep dish I got at Blue Line here in CA was more impressive."
,,,,,Service was great from Kevin (?)...the tall guy with tattoos on his arm.
,,,,,Note: It's approximately a 45-minute wait for pizzas.
,,,,,"I'm no expert in deep dish pizza but whooooo-wheeeee was Lou's muy delicioso. On a road trip from VA to CA, my family and I stopped by Chicago to pick up a deep dish pizza. Given that we we're swinging through for a quick min (mainly because everything was pretty much closed), I had to make an audible for a location. Fortunately 6K reviews, 4+ stars average shows that Yelp kinda knows something about this spot. At least that's what recent studies show. We swung by on Memorial Day, so the streets were fortunately empty enough, and without anyone checking parking we just stopped curbside for our food. The windows were tinted so it was tough to see inside, but they had a note on the door informing customers to call if no one came outside. Luckily we didn't have to call, and someone came out lickity-split."
,,,,,Food - 5/5
,,,,,"For three ravenous fellas, we ordered a large Deep Dish Lou - Cheddar * Mushroom * Sliced Tomato * Spinach Mix * Just Right * Cut. This would normally be around $25, but I added pepperoni and Italian sausage on separate halves. This shot up the price to about $38. We also ordered their combination platter (~$12) - cheese sticks, cheese balls (I think), calamari, etc. All this became about 4 full meals for all of us. The pizza was generously topped with the above ingredients that I never felt I missed anything, and actually never needed more. While the original ingredients were wonderfully cooked, I'm glad I was able to add the meats to the pizza. As you may tell, the original ingredients don't necessarily provide a solid salt/seasoned taste, so the meat (aside from the additional protein) was greatly appreciated. I've realized with many pizza locales that appetizers don't quite make the cut, but Lou's combination platter added a nice balance to the entire meal and of course reduced the amount of meals we would get for the rest of our road trip."
,,,,,Service - 5/5
,,,,,"Again, when we arrived the employees popped out to check on my order and informed me that it would take a few mins. Unfortunately it took a bit longer. But because it did, Lou's added cookies and some soda free of charge. If that ain't service I'm not sure what is."
,,,,,Overall - 5/5
,,,,,- In downtown so choose a good time to pickup curbside with less traffic
,,,,,- Note on door to call if they don't pop out quickly enough
,,,,,- Submit order online! It takes awhile to prepare. We ordered about an hour out; you can also set the time for your pickup
,,,,,They don't need my review; clearly they've earned their stars!  This particular place has great ambience of a renovated old building and great service.  We got there last night around 6 and had a 4 minute wait.... we left about 8 and the waiting line was all over the sidewalk.  The pan pizza was exemplary and while we waited for it to be made longer than a dominos or Pizza Hut clearly the wait was worth it
,,,,,  Very generous toppings so be mindful of how many you add!   Of course we'll be back.
,,,,,The best pizza I've ever had!! Took a road trip from our home in NYC to Chicago just for pizza and a game at Wrigley Field. I love pizza and NYC has some pretty good pizza spots but I must say that Chicago pizza wins hands down. 
,,,,,I found this place on (where else) Yelp and we sat outside our a beautiful day. The service was great. The server was very informative and patient. My husband and son got the meat pizza and I had the Lou. Absolutely delicious!! This is a meal in itself. 
,,,,,This pizza is a reason to move to Chicago or at least visit regularly.
,,,,,"I asked a trusted colleague for the top restaurant that he would recommend for a first-time visitor to Chicago, and he recommended Lou Malnati's."
,,,,,I am really glad I asked him and appreciate his suggestion.
,,,,,The staff was friendly and welcoming. We felt totally safe being there and everything was socially distanced
,,,,,"I ordered butter crust which was just the best. They use delicious mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce with real pieces of tomatoes, our server was so great."
,,,,,I wish I could remember his name!! Our order came much faster than expected.
,,,,,Everything was made perfectly and was flavorful.
,,,,,This place is really worth the visit.
,,,,,"The infamous Lou Malnati! I came to Chicago hoping to eat the city's delicacy (deep dish pizza). After asking multiple people and researching, it seems this was the place to be."
,,,,,Food: 9/10
,,,,,"- No joke, food was really good. As for the deep dish pizza, we had the  Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza as recommended by our server. The core of the pizza was good and cheesy, though it was not as deep as I thought it would be. However, it could be because we had the smaller pan. The crust was ok, but I wish it was crispier. "
,,,,,"- What was even more amazing was their Stuffed Spinach Bread, which we got as an appetizer. It was honestly one of the best stuffed bread I ever had. It had a very soft and moist interior that was mildly cheesy with a mild crunch after biting into it."
,,,,,Environment/Service: 5/10
,,,,,"- In terms of this location, the restaurant itself felt like a nice pizzeria restaurant as it should be with a bar. There is nothing too special about it"
,,,,,"- What brought this rating down was primarily the wait. Luckily we were sat rather early, but we were told it could be much longer. They also recommended that we order prior to being seated because it can take up to an hour! We were about to order but was then sat, and the food sadly did that that long. "
,,,,,Overall: 8/10
,,,,,Recommendation: Lives up to its name. Would try the larger pan pizza next time and again get the Spinach Stuffed Bread
,,,,,My girlfriend and I decided to stop here while we were in Chicago last weekend to try their deep dish pizza. The ingredients were very fresh and the pizza did not leave us with the heavy feeling we usually get after consuming deep dish pizza. I prefer thinner crust pizza but their deep dish pizza was awesome.

,,,,,"First time trying deep dish pizza a couple of years ago. We were skeptical at first, but when we tried it, we were amazed!! This is some of the best pizza we've ever had. We get the Lou, and it is worth every single bite! The sauce, cheese and buttery crust are all perfect! Now, when we go to Chicago, we plan to have Lou Malnati's as our first meal, and this gives us a few days to have it again as our last meal. I've seen people walk in with their luggage straight from the airport. It is that good! "
,,,,,"Only complaints are that the wait is long, especially at peak hours, and you have to wait 45 minutes after ordering your pizza for it to be made."
,,,,,"This place was amazing! A true taste of Chicago! My wife ordered the penne pasta, and I ordered the classic deep dish pizza. We are advised that the pizza takes 30+ minutes to make so my wife and I had the penne come out first to split then split the pizza. Penne pasta is something I'd never choose to order myself but I'm glad she ordered it. It was very tasty. Then when the pizza came out, we were both blown away! Great flavor and gooey deep dish consistency! So good"
,,,,,"Amazing pizza, probably the best deep dish in the city! Maybe the best ranch too?! Get the butter crust and thank me later!"
,,,,,Boo...
,,,,,OK seriously the pizza here was garbage. We came to Chicago and felt like it was imperative to try deep dish pizza. I have better deep dish pizza delivered by Domino's in Renton Washington OK. It was terrible. They have this huge wait and snatch waiters working in there that are rushing you and having a bad attitude. Only for you to sit down and get served a sub par pizza. I'm really disappointed. When I come back to Chicago I will not be going to this place. Trash!

,,,,,Lou Malnati's Pizzeria
,,,,,"So wanted to try Lou's on my trip, and after our architecture boat tour, we came here on Sunday around noon. I appreciate you can place your order, and they text you with updates for your wait. We didn't wait as long as they said (30 minutes) but given a bar top table right next to the door, so it was really chilly everytime the door opened and closed."
,,,,,"Our server was great, though the pizza did take much longer than we thought since we placed the order so early. The classic was tasty, this was my favorite deep dish of the trip. It's not as deep and the crust is thin and crunchy. For 2 people, it was not overly heavy at all, and the perfect size for us."
,,,,,"This is the original Lou Malnati's Pizzeria location. That said, expect a wait because if you're like me, you just can't live without experiencing a meal with the charm of an original location (like many others in line). The good news is that, given it's crazy popularity for the deep dish pizza, they have a streamlined seating process which includes texting you when your table is ready and having you order your pie before you get seated so that it comes out in a timely manner. Deep dish pizza greatness takes about 45 minutes to cook!"
,,,,,"Because of the wait and anticipation, especially if you've never had true deep dish pizza, your eyes might be more hungry than your stomach actually is. I would trust the menu when it says a certain pizza size feeds X amount of people. One slice is already pretty filling if you're just moderately hungry. If you're still hungry afterwards, you have a good excuse to go eat something else delicious at another one of Chi-town's many tasty eateries."
,,,,,"As far as what to order, all you really need is a slice (or maybe 2) of the The Malnati Chicago Classic! If you're a purist, I wouldn't add anything and just appreciate it as the creators intended it to be! Munch on that butter crust and chomp on that amazingly sweet sweet sausage. Highly consider ordering a local beer to wash all that nomnom down."
,,,,,"If you only have time for 1 Chicago deep dish pizza experience, this is probably the best place to do it. Beat the crowd if you can!"
,,,,,Came in after a spending a long day at the Art Institute on 10.04.19. It was surprisingly packed for about 4:30-4:45 p.m. but it was a Friday.  
,,,,,"With a stroke of luck, my better half scored two seats at the bar.  We very happily placed our order for a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms, an order of calamari, and the Malnati Salad which had lettuce, crisp salami that was the consistency of crispy bacon bits, mushrooms, black olives, blue cheese crumbles with a slightly sweet vinaigrette. "
,,,,,"My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The salad was hands down the highlight of our dinner. Try it, you will not be disappointed!  I'm considering ordering the dressing online and try to recreate it at home- it's that good. "
,,,,,"The calamari was pretty standard fare.  The pizza was good, but I didn't really care for the crust.  It was crispy and buttery but it had the texture of dessert pie crust rather than pizza crust.  This might be blasphemy but I thought the crust was just okay and must be an acquired taste.  Sorry, Chicagoans! "
,,,,,"As soon as we finished up with dinner, this place was jam packed shoulder to shoulder to shoulder, we really lucked out with those bar seats. Score! "
,,,,,Overall a great dinner and happy to have gotten in our Chicago deep dish pizza experience.
,,,,,"As a Chicago native, Lou's is by far my favorite deep dish around. The Lou deep dish pizza is made with fresh veggies and packed with flavor. We also always order the Malnati salad which is a blend of salty and savory like no other! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but if you haven't tried either of these- they are a MUST!"
,,,,,"This is my first time to Chicago. I was looking for a great place to try deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's Pizzeria was recommended. It lived up to the recommendation. We called to see if we needed reservations, and at the time we wanted to go, they said we didn't. We sat down and ordered appetizers and the deep dish pizza. When the appetizers arrived, they blew us away. The pizza was as good as advertised. Our waitress, Natalie was very friendly and made our visit very enjoyable. If I come back to Chicago, I will come back. I highly recommend trying Lou Malnati's Pizzeria!"
,,,,,I was told between Lou Malnati's and Giordanos - these are the best pizza joints in Chicago. The number of reviews was impressive.
,,,,,"I was disappointed with both. This pizza reminded me of pizza I had in grade school. It was just purely boring. I cannot fathom the hype. I came to the conclusion that I am a fan of Chicago style pizza but not Chicago Pizza. The waitress was friendly, sociable and politically aware. "

,,,,,"There's no denying that Lou Malnati's is a popular Chicago pizza legend ... that has reached must-try pizza status. I'm glad I got to experience it with a couple foodies, but the consensus was that Lou Malnati's was just ok pizza ... best eaten as separate layers of cheese, meet, tomato sauce, and crust."
,,,,,"On the plus side, I LOVED the buttery crust. Seriously, this was some amazing thin delicious crust. Can I just get a couple pans with crust? No need on this visit since my wife is avoiding carbs and I could steal hers from her plate. Five stars for the crust."
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's Pizzeria is one of the most famous ... and popular ... Chicago pizza joints. The usual 40-minute wait works out because it gives diners a chance to order (after checking-in) so that pizzas are ready when getting seated. We lucked into only 5-minute wait, so, we got some drinks and hung out at one of the upstairs tables."
,,,,,"Overall, I'm glad I tried Lou Malnati's pizza, but I honestly like other deep dish and Chicago pizza joints more."

,,,,,The restaurant is open later on the weekends so that is a plus.
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"My husband and I each got our own personal pizza. I got a mushroom deep dish with their buttercrust. The pizza was amazing. I am not usually one for deep dish pizza, but this may have converted me. The crust was rolled out thinly (not to be confused with thin crust pizza) and filled with lots of cheese and topped with their delicious tomato sauce."
,,,,,"My husband got Malnati Chicago Classic. He is not a fan of pizza in general, but he enjoyed his pizza. He says he likes it better than regular pizza because the cheese is on the bottom."
,,,,,"We also got the combination platter to share. This platter was really made for definitely more than 2 people, but everything was delicious. My favorite part of the platter were the cheddar cubes."
,,,,,Service: 
,,,,,"The service at Lou's was pretty standard. Our server was kind and attentive. She made the suggestion of ordering an appetizer as those come out quickly while the pizzas take longer as they're made when you order them. Our appetizer came out quickly, and our pizzas followed around when we were about done eating it. "
,,,,,"TL;DR - If you're in Chicago, you have to get deep dish pizza and your first stop should be Lou's."
,,,,,We must have saved the best for last!
,,,,,"After three days of very underwhelming food in Chi-town, Lou Malnati's = Redemption!"
,,,,,We strolled in around 1:30pm on a Monday and were seated promptly.  No wait.  Off to a great start.
,,,,,"We ordered the spinach bread while we waited for the star of the show: the classic (small).   Both were friggin' amazing!   Loved the crust on both!  So light and crispy, especially for a deep dish pizza.  "
,,,,,"Make sure to bring your appetite.  The two of us could only finish half of the small, but that just means we have leftovers to fight over!"
,,,,,"Thanks to Colin, our server, who was awesome too!"
,,,,,I'm only going 3 stars because I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt and say that they were having a bad night. Received cold and dripping wet pizza just as others have complained about. 
,,,,,"Salad was pretty good. Boneless chicken wings and bread sticks were alright, but nothing to write home about. Ceasear dressing and ranch had a very heavy cheap mayonnaise taste.  "

,,,,,"I was on the hunt to try my very first deep dish pizza while visiting Chicago during my layover. This place did not disappoint. Service was great! Very nice staff. Although wait time for the food was long because they make all there pizza fresh I am happy I waited. I got the Express Meal which came with a Pepperoni deep dish pizza, A salad ,and a soda for only $12 such a steal. I dined outside since it was a nice day."
,,,,,"I was lucky enough to hit up some great Chicago eateries right before the pandemic. I knew coming into the city, a must have was a Chicago deep dish pizza. After lots of research and asking the locals, Lou Malnati's was the most popular choice.  We only had time for one pizza outing since we had other places to try, so we decided to come here. It was in very close proximity to our hotel and close to the Willis Tower which we did a night visit to. We were seated almost right away in the back room. Service was excellent from start to finish. "
,,,,,"Now to the food. Since we were eating all things Chicago from the time we landed, we weren't super hungry.  We started with some good ole garlic bread which is one of my favorite things in the world.  We munched on that and a Caesar salad.  We got the salad to cut through the richness of the pizza we were about to devour. Since we were visiting and our flight was the next day, we decided on a small Chicago Classic. We wanted to try what made them famous. This came with lean sausage, cheese and tomato sauce. Pretty simple but boy was it delicious!  First off, the buttery crust was nice and crispy but not too thick. They take the sausage and shape it into the size of the pizza to form one patty. Every bite has sausage and cheese. I love that they do it that way!  They serve the first piece and you get that awesome cheese pull you see in all the pics and videos. Amazing!  The small pizza was enough for two and filling. I'm more of a thin crust pizza kinda guy, but now I'm a deep dish convert. "
,,,,,Next time I'm ordering a frozen one to pack for my flight home. I know they ship them as well and I would also be willing to try that.  We're already ready to go back just for the pizza!
,,,,,"I went to this location on 10/11 and gave my number for a table. We were seated pretty quickly, and a hostess approached us and remembered us for the table instead of sending another text.

,,,,,Best pie in the city would have been 5 stars but got the order wrong. However the pizza was still amazing  just with the wrong topping.  It was a busy Sunday so don't worry we will be back!
,,,,,First time trying deep dish pizza... so must be the excitement. Great food... and service. Chicken wings were great. You get gluten free versions and also crustless options. So definitely has the choices for everyone. You cannot complete it cause it's a big pizza.
,,,,,WOW!! No need to look for another pizzeria in Chicago EVER again! Lou Malnati's Pizzeria's are truly the best! 
,,,,,"I came to Lou's because a friend of mine highly rated their restaurants, as a trusting friend, I went and was pleased with everything from beginning to end. "
,,,,,"THE PLACE: I went to two locations in the Chicago loop area. Both locations were clean and have a very cozy, welcoming environment. At one of the restaurants, we sat in and our waiter was so helpful and sweet. At the other location, we went only for pick up and our pizza's were ready at the estimated time with no problems at all.  "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"THE FOOD: For both of our visits, we ordered the same pizza with only one (regretful) difference. I ordered a pepperoni deep dish and my friend had tomatoes, basil, cheese deep dish. For our first time, our waiter recommended we got the buttery crust, as it made it crispy and flavorful. So we did, and wow! AMAZING!!!!! We were so delighted. The crust was garlic-y, buttery, crunchy yet still heavenly soft! However, for our call-in order we forgot to tell them to add it, and though the crust wasn't bad on it own, I wouldn't do it again, too plain and it didn't have as great of a texture as our first one did."
,,,,,"THE SERVICE: Great service, that simple."
,,,,,"Always great. Visited this location on the way taking my daughter back home to Chicago. We all wanted Deep Dish Chicago Pizza and she found this location online. Worked great. Very small location but we ate outside since it was a really nice day. Everything was great. Server was friendly and was there whenever we needed her, the food was, as always, amazing, and we had a great time chatting and watching the people go by. Just a really terrific casual lunch. HIGHLY recommended."
,,,,,"Was here last night with two others. Had small deep dish pizza with plain crust, pepperoni, giardiniera, and spinach, as well as boneless wings with barbecue sauce. Wings were particularly outstanding although deep dish was really good too. Would probably get pizza with sausage next time or with no meat as the pepperoni and veggies felt a bit weird together, but taste was really good."
,,,,,Had a really nice experience overall! Would definitely come back.
,,,,,"Ordered stuffed pizza with sausage, peppers, and onions. Overall, was quite good, but I'd probably get it in traditional deep dish format rather than as a stuffed pizza next time. Was here with 3 others; had a medium pizza, which we did not finish. Others in the party (from NYC) hated the stuffed pizza so they had like half a slice, meaning there were lots of leftovers. Overall, I think this is a bit better than Uno...Want to try Pequod's next time."
,,,,,"I was visiting Chicago and, like most tourists, I wanted to eat some deep dish pizza. I've only ever been to Giordano's which seems like a typical go-to for deep dish but I had many Uber drivers recommend me go to Lou Malnati's instead. I'm so glad I did!"
,,,,,"I find that the deep dish here is better - the crust is really buttery and the edges are crisped to perfection. My table also ordered a bruschetta appetizer, a few pasta dishes, and dessert. I found everything to be really delicious and the portion sizes to be very generous. The pasta is made in house! For $90 we were able to try 6 dishes (including pizza) which is a great value and I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. "
,,,,,"The deep dish pizzas take about 30-45min to create, so definitely come to Lou Malnati's if you have enough time for a longer lunch/dinner. Also, this place gets PACKED during peak hours. I recommend coming a bit earlier, even if you're not hungry, since you will have to wait for the pizza to cook anyway, and you can try to beat the lunch/dinner rush."
,,,,,I ordered a pizza and it never arrived. Called and Lou's promised a refund. I call three times and never received a credit and/or another pizza in exchange.
,,,,,"Personally my favorite deep dish in Chicago. The crust is super flaky and buttery, but still holds the structural integrity. I kind of prefer Zachary's in the East Bay a bit more, but Lou Malnati's is still pretty solid."
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's Pizzeria. If you would like to have a nice and neat, cool place to hang out that pair with delicious foods. this is definitely the best choice to hang out on. The place looks very neat, very organized and all as well as their staff are very professional about their works. and their Menu, it is all very organized as well. highlighted with such delicious treats and snacks that would please your cravings!

It is very crispy, and tasty and well-seasoned and cooked as well. The cheese in it is just perfectly melted and just great! I have no more words of this place than to just say that if you need a place to hang out and set your mood up, this is it! The place is neat, the staff are nice and the food's here is immaculate. I definitely would go back in here again with my friends maybe. keep up the good work!"

,,,,,We've eaten at several Lou Malnattis when in Chicago as well as ordered shipped pizza. Salad was TERRIFIC.  Tonight the crust was like a brick and when hit in the table did not crumble or break. The restaurant a little busy but no wait at the time. 
,,,,,"DEFINITELY disappointed after waiting through the pandemic and traveling 1,000 miles. "
,,,,,"What's just as bad is that NO ONE cared. Just said, oh sorry. Its NOT like it used to be. "
,,,,,Its my last visit to Lou's.
,,,,,"Lou Malnati's is one of the most famous places to have Chicago deep dish pizza, with several locations. The pizza is made to order, so it was actually at least a 30 minute wait once we were seated for our pizza to arrive to us. In the meantime, we had a caesar salad. We were expecting it to be a small portion, but the salad was huge. It was excellent and we finished the whole thing, which we regretted later as it made us too full for the pizza."
,,,,,"The pizza comes in four sizes: personal (for 1 person), small (for 2), medium (for 3), and large (for 4). The small size was more than big enough for the two of us. This was our first time having Chicago deep dish pizza, so we ended up being pleasantly surprised. With the pizza being deep, I had always assumed it would be mostly crust. It ended up being mostly cheese and sauce, which made the pizza extremely juicy and moist!"
,,,,,"Lou's was the perfect choice for our first time. Their pizza is fresh and delicious, with big portions at good prices."
,,,,,"Gotta say, I didn't have high hopes.  I will confess that my last experience with ""deep dish pizza"" was from that hut in which you get pizzas. "
,,,,,"Lou's knocked it out of the park with their classic deep dish pizza. The crust was crisp and tasted great.  The sauce was light, which let the rest of the pizza ingredients shine.   The sausage was really flavorful & the cheese was thick and stringy. And it wasn't ""heavy"", which is shows they really know how to provide a flavorful dish."
,,,,,Just had a second mail pizza   Cost is high but wow how delicious. Comes frozen and takes 50 minutes to bake. 
,,,,,Father John's treat. What a treat it was. 
,,,,,Certainly cheaper than flying to Chicago! 
,,,,,It's

,,,,,Thin crust pepperoni was amazing
,,,,,So was the deep dish vegetarian 
,,,,,1 small serves 1 good hungry person 
,,,,,Service was great too
,,,,,"My friend recently gifted my in frozen, shipped Lou Malnati pizza for helping her out during a busy month at work. Jokes on her because I would've done it for free because I love her but DANG I forgot how good Lou's was. To be fair, my family is full of Giordano's purists, but a blind taste test put them to shame. I think the sauce is slightly sweeter or maybe just not as acidic, which I enjoy. The crust is also very crumbly with good flavor. I am not describing it well at all ,but just take my word for it when I say its delicious. I also think its pretty cost effective having it shipped. I am in jersey, no where near Chicago so I figured it'd be very expensive, but if you purchase 6 you get each one for $20 - pretty good deal if you ask me. Keep in mind these bad boys feel 2-3 people."
,,,,,Best deep dish pizza! I love the chunks of tomato on the sauce. Would choose this to all the other deep dish pizzas!
,,,,,"I loved this place.  Service was great, pizza was fabulous and the place was so lively.  Staff was very conscious of your needs.  Always checking to make sure you are ok.  Pizza took quite a while to cook but when it came out it was well worth it.  It was sooo hot and irresistible.  I burned myself on my first attempt so I decided to wait.  We ordered a small pizza as was suggested for 2 people and my husband finished his half while I could barely finish my 1/4 slice of the pie.  In the end we ended up taking it go.  Cost is very reasonable.  One of our cheapest dinners.  Oh we got the classic deep dish.  It was well worth it.  Come hungry."
,,,,,"I love Lou Malnatis, and I'm a big time pizza person. I would not say it's the best pizza in Chicago, but it hits the spot. And, they have that deep dish stuff, if you crave it. They're always on time, and ready to go for pickup."

,,,,,We have loved Lou Malnati's for a long time - lately though (at least 3 times in the last few months) the pizza's have come with all the crust in the middle seemingly not fully cooked or something. You can't even hold a piece of the pizza to eat it...
,,,,,You may ask why we ordered again... because the first time we thought it was a fluke so we ordered again next time we were feeling like pizza. The 3rd time we just ordered quickly forgetting the last 2 times LOL

,,,,,"Went here to compare which was best between Giordano's, and I'd have to say this place is better! We got the wings, buffa-Lou and garlic parm style.. can I just say that garlic parmesan sauce is OUT OF THIS WORLD (Especially if you love butter)!? We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and added pepperoni and bell peppers.. a small was more than enough for 3 gals eating their way through Chicago! The crust was not too dense, and a perfect level of flakiness. Service was good and it wasn't too crowded around lunch time on a Friday. Will definitely recommend to any friends traveling to Chicago!"
,,,,,Carry out - Deep dish Pepperoni Pizza with Buttered Crust.
,,,,,Delicious. The sauce is very good.
,,,,,The wings and mozzarella sticks were pretty good. They were a good start. We got a deep dish pizza with Pepperoni with the butter crust. It was good. I ate it for like 2 days. It was good. The slices were a nice size. We got to eat in and they social distance well if you are worried about that. But its a good spot especially if you are not from Chicago. Must give it a try. Drinks were ok but don't expect to them to be overly strong.
,,,,,"Excellent pizza! If you want traditional Chicago style deep dish, this is your place! We ordered a small and medium for our family of 5, and we still had leftovers!! The pizza is so filling. I don't think I can ever eat pizza in Texas again. I'm officially spoiled to the best pizza in the world from Lou's!!!!"
,,,,,"I love this pizza!  I know my selection is not the traditional deep dish, but we ordered a thin crust with chicken sausage, spinach, mushrooms and onion and absolutely delicious!! The wait is definitely too long, so usage of a get in line app would be helpful to keeping people from standing in the cold. I wonder if they could make me one to bring home?"
,,,,,"So, I have always gone to Giordanio's, but my friend suggested this place was better. I will say the tomato sauce is so fresh and I truly enjoyed this establishment."
,,,,,I love Lou Malnati's pizza. I've ordered dine in and take out from here. I always get the Lou deep dish pizza and the Classic Chicago deep dish. Sometimes I also get pasta and a salad. Everything is always good.
,,,,,Being a tourist in Chicago I had to stop by and get a deep dish pizza and this place did not disappoint!! Surprisingly good also were the lemon pepper wings  and we got those to start as the pizza takes about 25-30 minutes but it is definitely worth the wait!
,,,,,The Lou is our favorite Chicago pizza!  Eating in and take out are great.  Great environment in the restaurant and friendly staff.
,,,,,"Ordered the gf pepperoni pizza Chicago style and my mind was BLOWN! I haven't had Chicago style pizza since I stopped eating gluten and WOW they have done an amazing job, my partner ordered a deep dish from Giordanos and said their regular deep dish tasted just about the same. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's I will be going back, ordering to get shipped and telling everyone! Thanks Lou!"

,,,,,"We came for deep dish pizza and they're known for their buttery crust which tastes like an overbaked biscuit. The crust is delicious and crunchy; however it's heavy on the cheese and very light on the sauce. We went on a weekday so it wasn't crowded and no lines. We were seated immediately. Deep dish pizza took about 45-60 mins to bake since it's a thick pie.  Our pizza was made incorrectly by accident so our serve informed us and offered us an appetizer on the house. We chose traditional chicken wings with 2 sauces: honey BBQ and garlic Parmesan, and OMG...they were delicious. The wings were small but they were fried to perfection!!! The sauces were to die for!!! The ranch was also super delicious and didn't have the heavy ranch taste. If you'd like a saucy pizza, Lou won't satisfy you. If this is your first time in Chicago, first time trying deep dish pizza, and in love with A LOT of cheese, go for Lou to experience it since it's so popular.  If you want a hearty and well balanced pie, go to Giordano's. If you want a pan style (thick crust) with caramelized cheese crust, go to Pequods. I like Lou's but I probably wouldn't come back because I like my pizza to be saucey and less cheesy. It'll come down to personal preference."
,,,,,"As a born and raised Chicagoan, lou's has been a staple deep dish spot. I usually have the takeout version, but this was my first time trying out this specific location. The whole experience was a little frustrating as I had called ahead to put my group's name down on the waitlist and showed up only to not have my name taken down. So our wait time was extended to about an hour. We took the restaurant's advice by ordering our pizza before being seated, but even then, we waited 45 min for our pizzas to come out. We ordered two smalls- the classic and the lou. This was the perfect portion for four of us to share and be full. The deep dish pizza from lou's is a chicago must, but this specific location may not be.."
,,,,,"In town and yelp suggested this place for a deep dish pizza. It was a Friday night around 8, it was a 45min wait. Fine I anticipated that. We sit down the waitress tells us if we want pizza to let her know soon because it takes 45min to cook it. So we ordered that first, with cheese break, and a salad, and lous chicken pasta. "
,,,,,"Bread was ok, salad was good. On to the main dishes. The pizza was subpar. Very thin crust, I almost didn't even know it had a crust at the bottom and not much cheese. Now the pasta. They said they make homemade sauce, there's no way! The creamy sauce tasted like a canned sauce with cheese added. It have zero flavor, not much chicken at all. It was horrible. "
,,,,,So glad the next night we went to Giordano's their pizza redeemed my deep fish pizza reviews.

The service at this particular location was excellent. Everyone was very friendly, accommodating, and more than generous with allowing us to try Chicago beers before deciding on one. We recommend the lemon pepper dry rub wings as an appetizer & the pizza of course! I know everyone goes for the deep dish, but the thin crust is excellent too. Whatever you do, don't forget to enjoy the delicious butter crust! This is a must!!!"
,,,,,Best deep dish in Chicago. Fresh ingredients separate this pizza from Gino's and Giordano's. The house salad is also outstanding and unique.
,,,,,Great to be spending a few days in my home town. Not much to say but we needed a day to relax after a late night wedding and a deep dish pizza was going to scratch that lazy hunger itch.
,,,,,"Pizza was a 3.5/5. Service was 0/5. We order before we got on the L for up north. Got there, had to wait in the rain, no worries, got drinks went back out in the rain. After waiting like 45 min since getting there we went back inside to check and they were like ""oh yeah it's right here"". After telling us they would call our name. I get you're a popular place but how about managing the place better. Idk if the pizza was worth it for the annoyance and hassle."

,,,,,I enjoyed the personal Lou pizza for a late lunch. I was sat promptly and the server was nice. I dined alone and she made sure I was comfortable. I think the personal size might taste a little different than the standard sizes (at least they look a tad different). This was my first Chicago style pizza. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed and the personal size could be a smidge larger. However I am so happy I could try a classic!

I got the gluten free option, it tasted like alcohol from the yeast and was doughy, undercooked. The sauce was flavorful and the only redeeming part of the pizza. The cannoli dip was bland and inauthentic, tasted like whip cream. The tortillas tasted burnt and were bland as well. Never coming back. Not worth the money."

,,,,,"Okay, I'm from NYC and the pizza and salad blew my expectations. My friends and I got a small deep dish and the Malnati salad and got it delivered to our hotel and I wasn't expecting much because it was delivered. "

,,,,,I've been ordering these Pizza's through gold belly for over a year and was in love with them. I recently ordered 2 of them online and something changed. They were terrible!!  So bad that I threw 1 of them away. I can't believe Lou Malnati''s would ship these to people. They obviously made a bad batch. The pepperoni pizza hardly had any sauce and was as thin as a pizza from Domino's. The sausage pizza was even worse. I hope they can figure out what went wrong and make good pizza's again one day.

,,,,,"We ordered the Malnati's Classic and added pepperoni. The hostess reacted to our order while we waited and preordered our pizza (that's a thing there...just go with it). She said, ""Good choice."" "

,,,,,"The crust was buttery and while firm in the outside, it wasn't overly tough or crunchy. I cut it with a fork, for reference. The sauce had enough tang but still a touch of sweetness. The balance of flavors between the lean sausage, pepperoni, cheese and, again, the buttery crust. "
,,,,,"Back to the experience, our journey started with a quick 30 minute wait (worth it), we were seated and the waiter proceeded to take the rest of our order. To make our mothers proud, we ordered a Caesar salad for some veggies. It was pretty good. Not the best and far from the worst. I'd say 8.1-8.3 on a 10 scale. "
,,,,,"Don't be fooled by seeing this Chicago institution all over the place and it's chain appearance, this is a local, quality food joint."

We did a build your own where you got to pick from a lengthy list of toppings as well as a choice of crust made it hard to decide but what a mouth watering pizza this was. Pizza takes about 30 minutes to cook so if you are just wanting to pop in and out I wouldn't recommend but if you have that extra time to spare, trust me and try it! You definitely won't regret it."

They were recommended by Llora who was a great server by the way and I'm sure glad I took her rec. I've never tried deep dish pizza nor did I care for it much thinking regular pizza probably tastes better, but I was proven wrong. The deep dish pizza is a different style of pizza so I don't think it's fair to compare the two, but I became a fan after trying it for the first time. Absolutely amazing and fairly priced! 100% would recommend to anyone who is a fan of pizza!! FYI there are multiple locations and copies of this place, so make sure to visit the one on WELLS ST!"
,,,,,Delicious pizza and attentive service. Spinach appetizer is amazing and marinara sauce was delicious.
,,,,,"My first ever Classic Chicago Deep Dish Pizza certainly did not disappoint. I had the Malnati Chicago Classic and WOW! it was very tasty. The sausage and cheese blended perfectly with the sauce, and the buttercrust was delicious, not soggy at all. The pizza was preceeded by a Chicken Caesar Salad: warm chicken, crisp greens, crunchy croutons with just the right amount of their delicious salad dressing. Of course, my waiter, Eddie, was extremely helpful in asking questions and making excellent suggestions. This gem certainly deserves a 5 star rating."
,,,,,"First time in Chicago, of course I had to try a deep dish pizza. Yelped it and decided to try this place. On a weekday lunch, got seated immediately outside. I had the smallest deep dish original pizza. They warned me it would take 20-30 minutes and I said fine. The best things in life cannot come easy."

,,,,,"Heard great things about Lou's when looking for the best deep dish pizza. This spot had better reviews than the one on Michigan, and indeed the pizza was fantastic. While waiting for the deep dish we tried the Minestrone soup, which was delicious. The pizza was incredible, and the ranch was bomb. "
,,,,,"Only problem was the service. The busers, hosts, and other staff were super friendly and helpful, except for our waiter Tony. Tony started the evening by neglecting to greet us for about 15-20 minutes, and when he finally reaches us, told us he was struggling with 4 tables and very busy. I understand Friday nights can be hectic, but this behavior continued. We gave him out order immediately, since we had read the menu thoroughly, but it took him about 20 more minutes to bring us water! He apologized for that as well, but seems pretty simple. "
,,,,,"The food came and definitely lifted our spirits, but not even into the second slice, Tony came by and handed us the check. We were planning on trying the tiramisu, but maybe next time! He did the same to the table behind us, who complained that they were not done, which we could tell even from our table. He did apologize after bringing back the check, which also took a while, but the damage had been done. "

You kinda expect some mishaps.  We were right.  Apparently, you have to be specific and request the pizza be cut!  We received a whole uncut pizza! I'm literally still trying to figure out why?!! They made up for it, the pizza was awesome.  Loaded with meat, cheese and the sauce was really good.  Not messy or too much sauce just perfect!  The salad was so fresh, well stocked with all the salad goodies.  I like the fact they had the sense to give you Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes!  There is nothing like a delivery of a pizza and they don't bring it!  Good job on the pizza.  I'd be back but I would ask for well done, the top crust was a little too hard and crunchy.  It was really good nevertheless!"

My wife and I pre-ordered our deep dish SMALL pepperoni pizza. We then waited in the bar for 45 minutes before we got seated. We then waited 45 minutes at our table before we got our pizza. While eating our pizza we ordered a small salad (mistake), that took almost 30 minutes to get out to our table. I asked our waitress were our salad was and we were told we didn't pre-order the salad it so it takes awhile. I thought the pizza was good, but by the time we waited to get the pizza we were starving so I'm undecided....Not sure I would go back."

,,,,,Wouldn't visit Chicago without having Lou Malnati's. Simply the best pizza I've ever had (lasagna was equally delicious).
,,,,,"I'm not too crazy about pizza, but this place is not your average pizza. Personally I've always loved thin crust pizza, but after having this deep dish pizza I may have to change my mind. They offer the option to split your pizza in half in terms of toppings/flavoring so I decided I wanted to try their top recommended pizzas. And I absolutely loved the Lou even though there was no meat in that pizza. The pizza takes about 30 minutes to make but well worth the wait. The crust and the bottom of the pizza is perfectly crispy, while the contents of the cheese and everything is full of flavor. It's just a really solid pizza and by far my favorite pizza place. I've had pizza in New York and in Texas, but hands down if I'm ever back in Chicago this is the place I'll be at for pizza."
,,,,,First time had deep dish pizza in Chicago. It was delicious. I liked the crispy crest a lot.
,,,,,"Excellent deep dish pizza! The Malnati salad was outstanding, with a bonus of having the dressing available for purchase, for our use at home until we can return!"
,,,,,"Ya this is the real stuff here. I came for deep Chicago pizza and boy did I get it. Great food great service. Just great great great. I mean damn, this isn't an option if you like pizza, it's a must go to."
,,,,,So good! Went here with the family during Christmas break and everyone loved it!! Great atmosphere too!
,,,,,"I was born & raised in Chicago and Lou Manati's is practically a religion there. If you like deep dish pizza, this is the place for you, absolutely. A Chicago tradition! You can even get pizzas frozen to bake at  home."
,,,,,"The food was so delicious. Our server Ryan was awesome. I will definitely come back for more if I'm ever back in the area. If you want deep dish pizza in Chicago, this is where you need to go."
,,,,,Lou's is definitely my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. The Lou is the best pizza... vegetarian and the tomatoes always taste so fresh.
,,,,,"Most locations also have the Sampler... I know it's all fried, but the sauces are incredible."
,,,,,Lou Malanti's will always get my vote for pizza.
,,,,,"My favorite spot for deep dish in Chicago. This is where I take all my out of town visitors. Delicious pizza and great menu options. Close to Michigan avenue and the riverwalk, making it a convenient place to end the day with dinner."

,,,,,"Classic and Lou's pizza was very good but filling.  Most of us thought we could eat 2 pieces and could only eat 1.  Service was slow but to be fair they were short staffed.  The waiters were good for as many people they were waiting on.  The Caesar salad was fresh and tasty.  Overall, I would recommend for a good Chicago style pizza!!!"
,,,,,My first night in Chicago I knew I had to try deep dish and luckily Lou Malnati's was right around the corner from my Airbnb. We got the Lou's without mushrooms.
,,,,,"The pie came out within maybe 30 minutes of being seated and 30 minutes of waiting on a table. The small was $19, but it makes sense considering the time and ingrediants they put into their pizzas. I thought the layering was great and the tomato chunks were a great touch. "
,,,,,The staff were accommodating for us first timers and the ambience was great for a date or just hanging out with friends. They were very clean and wore masks. 
,,,,,I can't wait for my next trip to Chicago!
,,,,,"My friend made a reservation online and he invited me to have dinner with him. At first I refused because I'm not a fan of pizza but he insisted that I come and he promised I would love the pizza too. And also there are other dishes that the restaurant serves. We sat near the window where we could see the view from the outside. He ordered Deep Dish Cheese Pizza, The Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza , Chicken Wings , Caesar Salad and Coke. I like the flavor of chicken wings and caesar salad is so fresh in my mouth. When it comes in pizza "
,,,,,I preferred Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza that was made in Lou's lean sausage with extra cheese. It has an intense flavor and there is a lot of cheese. Every bite of pizza has cheese on it. And I love cheese! Cheese is my favorite topping. And I had to try this again.
,,,,,"I really love the taste of pizzas from here, but I really wish that they would get a vegan cheese. That would really make it great for me and millions of other vegans!! They should partner up with Miyokos for some plantbased cheeses!"
,,,,,This was one of the most delicious meals we've had from a restaurant in a while! 
,,,,,We called in our order an hour ahead since we were driving through Chicago and it was ready when we arrived and still warm. The ladies at the front were very sweet. 
,,,,,We ordered the small Lou deep dish pizza and the medium Malnati salad to share. 
,,,,,"The Lou pizza was so full of flavor with the mushrooms, cheese and basil. "
,,,,,The salad was fresh and also so full of flavor. 
,,,,,We'll definitely be back to try the other pizzas and salads!
,,,,,Some of the best pizza in Chicago. Deep dish is the specialty here but I think their thin crust is a hidden gem.
,,,,,"Let me start this off by saying, ""thank goodness for good managers,"" as this was probably the worst experience in a restaurant I have EVER experienced. "
,,,,,"I'm writing this review as I'm sitting at my table, which I have been at for over TWO HOURS because the service is non existent. I understand the shortage of employees due to COVID but there are plenty of servers here. "
,,,,,We have been asked three times for our order - at first I thought he was kidding but wasn't. We then asked for Parmesan cheese and hot peppers - we were given two shakers and I sprinkled the cheese but I immediately discovered I had covered my pizza with garlic salt. 
,,,,,"We tell the server and he goes, ""oh, it is."" Are you sure it's not Parmesan? "
,,,,,"Our plates were cleared and then we waited for almost 20-25 minutes until my boyfriend stopped him and goes, ""we'd like to order a chocolate chip dessert cookie."" He writes it down - turns and grabs plates off another table and goes, ""so what did you want to order?"" "
,,,,,"We order AGAIN and then he comes back to our table about 15 minutes with pizza plates and appetizer plates and my boyfriend goes, ""you do realize we already ate - we are just waiting for our chocolate chip cookie pizza."" He tells us that they make him bring out plates to everyone who's ordering dinner. "
,,,,,"Before you ask, no, I'm not making any of this up. "
,,,,,"After that last interaction, he then comes out to our table and said the computer system shut off and restarted and he hadn't put in our order and asked us a THIRD time, what we wanted to eat. So again we said the cookie. "
,,,,,"By now we are approaching the two hour mark. One of the kitchen staff brought out our cookie and even though our server walked past us multiple times, he never stopped back at our table. "
,,,,,"And no, we weren't mean, we tried to be understanding but this was beyond ridiculous. "
,,,,,"I finally went up and asked for the manager. She came to our table and I shared to her that we had been in the restaurant for now, over two hours, and had a horrible experience. She sincerely apologized and said that was not acceptable and comped our bill. "
,,,,,I really hope this server gets more training. He was a really nice guy but obviously in waaaay over his head.

,,,,,---Pre-Covid Review---
,,,,,"My first Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, though not my last thanks to the Chicago Pizza Tour (seriously look them up, they're great)! Made this our tourist pick of the trip and came by on a Thursday for an early lunch. I really needed this to go well. I've tried deep dish pizza a few times out in California and they were all pretty terrible. "
,,,,,Ordered 2 personal pizzas which was about the right amount for a light/medium sized lunch for my friend & I. Between the two I preferred the Lou. The classic is good and I did enjoy the sausage but the Lou just has more going on. 
,,,,,General impressions:
,,,,,-Great sauce! I'm all about that acidity and they got it
,,,,,-Buttery cracker like crust around the edges that goes super well w/ the cheese that's gotten extra baked on.
,,,,,-There's plenty of toppings but not enough cheese. I am a cheese fiend and I want cheese pull in every bite.
,,,,,-Good sausage w/ great flavors
,,,,,"Overall I've concluded the California deep dish pizza is trash. I'm sorry for ever doubting that it could actually be good. That being said, is it better than NY pizza? Not for me at least. Between the price and the wait time and general ratios, I'd still go for a slice of NY pizza anyday but I do enjoy the more calm, sit-down experience of deep dish too and Lou Malnati's is a solid spot (big surprise there...)"
,,,,,"Great pizza. We ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic and it was so good. The crust was crunchy, the cheese was very cheesy, and the topping were perfect. My two friends and I split a large and were able to take some slices home."
,,,,,"I was a tourist in Chicago so take my word with a grain of salt, but my friend and I tried both Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, and Lou Malnati's was better! There was less overall cheese (still plenty though) and more sauce, and they made the crust nice and buttery somehow. Service was kind of slow, but I'm guessing it's because they make the pizzas fresh. "

,,,,,"If you've never tried deep dish pizza and can't decide if you want to go to Giordano's or Lou Malnati's, pick Lou Malnati's, they won't disappoint you."
,,,,,"We ordered the Lou -- Spinach mix (enhanced with garlic, basil & onion), mushrooms a,nd sliced Roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses, on a garlic Buttercrust. When the pizza came out, it was very watery. I'm guessing it's from the tomatoes. Be sure to pack your patience -- the pizza can take at least 30 minutes to prepare! "
,,,,,Tourists - You can ship pizza (and other Chicago goodies) to your family and friends 
,,,,,"Tried the deep dish pizza great atmosphere, good people, loved the fried cheddar cheese balls,"
,,,,,"This was recommended to us by a tour guy as a super place to experience Chicago deep dish pizza. There are several locations. Ours was in a basement setting near the river. OK is the best we can say. The service was quick and friendly. The pizzas (we're from California and had heard of Chicago deep dish pizzas as something special) were OK. Not nearly spicy enough (oregano, etc.) The small size was plenty of food to take back to the hotel. Atmosphere so-so. Service quick. The waiter said it would take 30 to 45 minutes to get the pizzas (about the size of a round cake pan), so because we were hungry, we ordered brushetta to tide us over. The pies came out right away. I we ever come back to Chicago, this won't be a ""must"" for us."
,,,,,"First time visiting Chicago and what a great city it was.This place was so great and the setting was so comfy to.This was a 12"" pizza and it was delicious.I should have go one to go lol.The Bruschetta was was just as good to.From the time we walked in the door until we left our service and food was 5 stars."
,,,,,Wayyyyyy better than my experience at the Wrigley location.This was my first deep dish pizza and it's was delicious but the sausage for us all tasted not bad but.Again it's not bad but I think we all expected a spicy sausage or something.
,,,,,"I appreciate that you can put your order in before you sit down. These pies take a while to cook so it is helpful to get a head start. Wings are delicious, staff is friendly, and they offer gluten free options- what's not to like?"
,,,,,First time in Chicago and everyone from friends to my uber driver were telling me to try this place if I wanted a good deep-dish pizza. Now I'm completely basic when it comes to pizza preferences so I will say coming to this place did not turn me into a deep dish fanatic but I definitely enjoyed my meal. There was a ridiculous wait but they allow you to order your food while waiting for a table. I was able to get my table pretty quickly because I was solo dolo. My pie consisted of half of the Chicago Classic & half of The Lou (only way I could do this is if I ordered the size up from the personal). Both were so good but definitely couldn't finish it so I took it back to my hotel for the next day (tasted better than the day before). 
,,,,,Overall I can say I've had Chicago deep dish pizza!
,,,,,BEST  PIZZA  EVER.
,,,,,I looked up several reviews for this place and all of the good ones aren't wrong at all.
,,,,,I drove out here on a food trip and it didn't disappoint. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for the following reasons:
,,,,,Cleanliness: they do a good job with social distancing by limiting the seating in doors and spacing the seating outdoors. All employees I saw had masks on and they encouraged me to wait outside for my pizza.
,,,,,Service: the time they quoted me was spot on (35 minutes) and the hostesses brought it out to me. I felt special!
,,,,,"Taste: this is my favorite thing to report on because the pizza was memorable! The crust was thick and buttery. The fresh cheese (from neighboring Wisconsin) was spot on! Hot and gooey. The sausage and other toppings were layered on next. Then the incredible tomato sauce. Savory, slightly chunky, and married all of the ingredients together."
,,,,,"I'll try their competitors one day I'm back in Chicago, but for now, Lou Malnati's is the BEST in my opinion. I highly recommend this place. #HastyFoodiePic"
,,,,,"Slightly off the beaten path from most touristy spots in/around downtown, so we didn't have to wait to be seated. As to be expected, great service, amazing Ceasar salad, and 'The Lou' (spinach, fresh tomatoes, and 'shrooms) with added sausage was excellent. I enjoyed it with the house Chianti. Next time, we'll try a different Chicago pizza joint, but would definitely come back to Lou's if given the opportunity!"
,,,,,"Awful pizza! I came to Chicago in hopes of trying some great pizza and was suggested this spot by my Lyft driver. OMG, he definitely set me up for failure. Zero flavor, so crispy as if I was eating glass and undercooked calamari. I will never be returning to this establishment. I definitely wasted my money and time."

,,,,,"We landed in Chicago today and our first stop was Lou! We were starving! We ordered a thin crust for my daughter and ""The Lou"". We also ordered the combination platter since the pizzas were going to take around 30mins. "
,,,,,"Service was fantastic! Our server was very attentive - checked in, refilled our drinks, boxed our leftover pizza. Thanks for the great service!!"
,,,,,"I recently ordered delivery via their web site...delivery was fast, hot, and nicely packaged."
,,,,,I read that they recommend that you do NOT have your PIZZA CUT at the restaurant so that it travels better....I followed the advice and completely agree!
,,,,,"I ordered the Spinach and Tomato thin crust pizza which had the same buttery taste as the deep dish pizza, was piled high with fresh, gourmet toppings and cheese....I cannot wait to order it again REAL SOON!"
,,,,,I also ordered the Buffalo Wings which were a mixture of pieces.  Moist and large in size.  They also came with celery and ranch dressing or blue cheese.
,,,,,I love supporting local businesses that are family run and this is definitely a true Chicago treasure!
,,,,,I ordered the Lou's Style Pizza which was amazingly delicious..the only problem is that whoever added the tomatoes put a couple of butt pieces of the tomato in which the core on the top was evident..and it was several pieces like this...pricey pizza should have quality tomatoes??????!!!!!
,,,,,Also the crust was burned around some of the pizza......bummer!
,,,,,The salad and salad dressing were delicious....
,,,,,Not bad however not the most amazing deep dish option. Just ok as a deep dish option.
,,,,,"Overpriced, somewhat lousy service for a subpar pizza.  I've even been let down by their takeout.  In this city, there are a lot of better pizzas to be had for under $40."
,,,,,Lou Malnati definitely has the best crust out of all the deep dish pizza joints in Chicago. The wait time here was not that long considering it is right in the middle of downtown Chicago. You have to get the classic Chicago deep dish pizza and wash it down with some good draft on tap. I could spend a whole week just eating Chicago deep dish pizzas here.
,,,,,"Enjoyed the bruschetta as an appetizer, Deep Dish with sausage, fresh basil, and garlic and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Also had a cookie cake with ice cream for dessert.  All of the food and drink was delicious, and of course the reason why you need to go here."
,,,,,"There was no wait for a table, but the dining area we sat in was lit a bit brighter than I would've liked for a dinner setting. The service was great - our server was attentive, thoughtful, and made great recommendations for drinks and dessert."
,,,,,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I feel there are other comparable pizza options in the city of equal quality for a lower price. I looked into the pay structure for employees in hopes of seeing that money go to higher wages, but it seems the employee industry matches up with industry standards."
,,,,,"Overall, highly recommend Lou Malnati's!"
,,,,,"Good food especially with a hungry 12 year old, who's belly was hungry for pizza and some dark soda!!!!"
,,,,,"A Chicago landmark, Lou Malnati's is a destination stop for pizza lovers! Their deep-dish pizza has reached iconic status and I couldn't wait to try it! Because of COVID, it was easy to get a seat. Ordered the bbq wings and the Malnati Classic deep dish pizza which was sausage, cheese, tomato sauce over their famous ""butter crust"". Added pepperoni for good measure. Was disappointed that meatballs was not a topping option. Pizza did not disappoint with thick layers of cheese and sausage and topped with a really nice marinara. The butter crust was good but wasn't necessarily a differentiator for me. Really enjoyed the pizza, wings were average. While Malnati's deep dish was really good, it didn't quite have the wow factor I was expecting. That being said, food was delicious and the service was solid."
,,,,,The pizza was okay. This is my first trip to Chicago and for years I've heard so many things about Chicago  and I wasn't to impressed. We have a Chicago pizzeria in Tucson and it was better than this. However we did get a free pizza cookie  and free ice cream with the meal so 1 extra star for that.

,,,,,Classic deep dish pizza spot in Chicago. Service was ehh but the food was so amazing. This pizza will very well be the best deep dish you will ever have. Love the sausage and the chunky tomatoes. Can't wait to try other items next time.
,,,,,we were in chicago and so were going to eat chicago pizza.  previously i had tried giordanos so this time i wanted to try lou malnatis - also lou has an everyday lunch special in which you can get a salad or soup + personal pizza or pasta; and this is a good way to try a couple of different dishes. 
,,,,,"we went to one lous but they said they had an hour wait, even after putting our name down online, so we looked online and there was this location on wells that had no wait so we went over there.  "
,,,,,"we were immediately seated and reviewed the menu.  while reviewing the menu and waiting to be greeted, we heard other patrons complaining about the time and the server saying ""there's no workers so everything is taking a long time"".  "
,,,,,"when the waitress came to us, they said that the food was going to take at least 20 mins so we ordered the lunch special and bruschetta to start with.  "
,,,,,"after about 15 minutes the bruschetta came which was nice with good chunks of tomatoes, nice seasoning and good flavor of cheese on top - but it was expensive as it was the same price as the lunch special"
,,,,,we were still eating the bruschetta when the food came in - we had ordered a cheese personal pizza and lasagna; they were supposed to come with soup or salad but the server forgot those
,,,,,the pizza was decent and had good flavor; the lasagna was alright but the marinara sauce on top was good; and when the soup and salad came the salad was basic but the vegetable minestrone soup was decent
,,,,,"overall, the lunch special was nice and the flavors were good but would i want to wait an hour for it - no! would i order the bruschetta again, no!"
,,,,,"I loved that it is in the historic Wrigley building. Our table was located in the basement. Waitstaff was efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. Our deep dish pizza was great and filling allowing us to take a piece home.  The restaurant, like many these days, has lots of hard surfaces and is pretty loud  but that is also because this business is busy. "
,,,,,Highly recommend this business. Please note that they have numerous locations in and around Chicago.
,,,,,"10/10 would recommend. The pizza was as good as people say, the service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere can't be beat. We'll definitely be back."
,,,,,"We tried this pizza place since it was the first pizza place that showed up in the results when we typed in Chicago Deep Dish pizza. The pizza isn't bad, but... nothing about it wowed us either. "
,,,,,"We had a The Lou as a deep dish pizza. It took about 30 minutes for the pizza to arrive at our table since they claim to make their pizzas from scratch. The pizza itself was over hyped: A ton of dough, small amount of meat, and an excess of tomato sauce. The chicken wings we ordered were better than the actual pizza. But that and the sauces were too salty. "
,,,,,"For tourists, it's better to just order online and have it shipped to wherever you live. Especially since they don't only have locations in Illinois. Try another pizza place that is actually exclusive to Chicago."

We had no idea in general it takes about 45mins-1hr for the pizza to cook, but when we did finally get it, very delicious. I recommend coming for a sit down rather than a take out because you'll be waiting a bit. They do take your name and number though so you could walk around until they call you letting know your food is ready."
,,,,,"I prefer Giordano's over this place. It takes 35-40 minutes to make the pizza, which is fine if you end up getting an incredible pizza. The pizza was just ok. We ordered a large half the Lou Manatí special and half the classic. The sauce was good, but the crust was not the best, kind of hard and chewy at the same time. The cheese was terrible. It stretched but was like rubber. I had hope this would be a good deep dish but I will have to keep looking!"

,,,,,I am stuck in Chicago for about a month due to a life saving surgery to remove a spinal tumor at Northwestern and to rehabilitate at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.  Whenever I call the Neurosurgery department at Northwestern they also mention the Lou and Jeanne Malnati Brain Tumor institute so it's nice to see the founder and his wife of this popular Chicago pizza chain are doing such great lifesaving work.  
,,,,,"We picked Lou Malnati's to be delivered to me and fiancé at Shirley Ryan for quite a sad occasion, a close family friend died from a series of brain strokes.  In her memory we ordered from here on her funeral day as this is her favorite pizza place and probably any restaurant as her favorite food was pizza.  We ordered something unique that we may try from other places too, an Italian beef deep dish tomato and cheese pizza.  It was delicious and could easily feed both of us.  Very well balanced with the amount of tomato sauce, cheese, crust, and toppings.  We also had a combo platter of appetizers that included fried mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks, fried mushrooms, and our favorite that beats Culver's, fried cheese cubes (or cheese curds as they are commonly called).  Sorry that I forgot to take pictures as this was an emotional time.  "

,,,,,"We wanted to visit Chicago last year but due to the pandemic, we couldn't. So a few days ago, I ordered from Tastes of Chicago and had six 9"" deep dish pizzas sent to me in California. I figured even though we weren't able to travel there, at least we could have a taste of what deep dish pizza is like from Chicago."
,,,,,We tried the veggie and pepperoni pizzas and the butter crust was very good! Someday I would like to try it at their restaurant but this will do for now.
,,,,,"David was our waiter - super attentive and friendly. We tried the garlic bread, calamari, and boneless Buffalo wings. All yummy. It was my first time trying deep dish and I really didn't think I would like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got a personal side extra cheese pizza-delicious! Not super saucy like I anticipated, it was actually super cheesy. The crust was great. Can't compare this deep dish to any other since I only tried this one, but I would definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,"When in Chicago... pizza is a must!! Lou Malnati's was great!! We could have been seated but chose to sit at the bar. Nick was having a good night... his 3rd night on the job actually. Friendly and cranking out the cocktails! We ordered a small deep dish cheese sausage & mushroom pizza... we were starving too, but it was worth the wait!! Crispy crust that was so scrumptious you wouldn't believe it, with sauce riddled with chunks of tomato and sausage and mushroom! Seriously, it was so good we might have to go back a second time on this visit haha! Blue Moon and Daisy Cutter to accompany this divine pizza pie! Cute decor and nice atmosphere... inside dining and outside dining. Perfecto!!"
,,,,,"Everything about my experience here was horrible. Worst restaurant experience in my life. The service was slow and rude, and the dough was barely cooled and raw inside. I expected amazement and walked out disgusted. Would never go back or recommend ever. 0/10."
,,,,,"AMAZING! Best garlic parm wings I've EVER had!! We came for the pizza obviously but wanted a side so we chose the garlic parm wings and I've been dreaming about them ever since. The small order comes with 8 perfectly sauced, perfectly fried, and perfectly sized wings. Then we had a small size of the Malnati's classic deep dish pizza with sausage and it was incredible. The cheese pull was to die for. I will say it got kind of cold quickly so the second slice wasn't as good as the first (temp and cheese pull wise) but still very tasty with awesome sauce, amazing cheese, and crunchy but soft crust. Only here for 4 days and will prob be back tomorrow :)"
,,,,,"I don't think you can really get a better example or experience of  Chicago deep dish anywhere. To meet the demands of fickle diners Lou's provides many ways of ordering their pizza. Don't experiment with non-buttered or thin crust OR God-forbid gluten free here! Get it deep, get it buttered, and if your getting sausage get it edge to edge! Persnickety dinners are likely to opt for many of the ""alternative"" preparations and not get a true experience. BTW these are the people that complain they didn't like their choice."
,,,,,We ordered delivery and it was fantastic! We had the Malnati's Classic and the Lou's. Both were exceptional. The crust was perfectly crisp on the classic and a bit soggy k.
,,,,,"While visiting Chicago, we definitely wanted to try deep dish pizza. Lou Manalti's was in walking distance from our hotel, so we decided to try it. When we visited at beginning of November, restaurants could only have customers eat outside due to CoVid which was great because the weather was beautiful. We went at lunchtime and luckily a table was available. "
,,,,,We started off with the garlic bread which was a nice appetizer while we waited for our pizzas to be cooked. I'm glad we did because the bread was soft and delicious with the perfect amount of garlic and butter.
,,,,,"Regarding the pizza, I liked that they offered personal sizes. This is perfect when you have a large group or when people have different preferences or dietary needs. There were three of us in our group and we each decided to order a personal size. I ordered the deep dish cheese with peppers and onions, and decided to pay extra for the buttercrust. To me, it was the perfect size, I even had left overs. The pizza was good, my only complaints were that I wish that it had more taste and the sauce seemed a little watery. Looking back, I wish that I had added a meat. This probably would have added the taste that I was looking for. Also, maybe if the onions and peppers had been cut a little larger, this probably would have added flavor."
,,,,,"So yummy! The crust was our favorite part - kind of crackery and thinner than some Chicago deep dish spots but sturdy enough for all the yummy cheese, sauce, and toppings"
,,,,,"I couldn't leave Chicago without having some of their famous Deep Dish Pizza. While shooting some street photography with a friend a native Chicago resident he suggested this place and I couldn't have been any more pleased. While there was a short wait to be seated due to covid capacity limits, the wait is with it. We had the Malnati Classic with Patti Sausage and it was amazing, along with toasted cheese bread which taste just as great as the pizza. Our server was amazing. The drink menu is amazing I had the Windy City Sour it was amazing. This place will be one of my go to spots when I come to Chicago. You won't be disappointed."

,,,,,"The bruschetta was so good, so was the personal pan pizza. So so good.  "
,,,,,Outside or inside dining. Excellent wait staff and it really wasn't as long as a wait as is rumored.
,,,,,"We arrived in Chicago late in the evening and starving. So hungry, I couldn't take a picture of the bruschetta without first taking a bite. I couldn't put my phone down fast enough - I needed MORE. Hands (and phone) down, this was the best bruschetta I have ever had. "
,,,,,"The pizza was excellent, as was the service. My only very slight critique of the pizza is one of personal preference and not any actual criticism - the house sausage was an entire layer on the pizza, and not smaller chunks. "
,,,,,Visit hungry and you won't leave disappointed.
,,,,,"We are visitors from the West Coast, but I used to live in Chicago and never ate here (the OG of deep dish). "
,,,,,"Came right after a huge snow storm, so guessing that kept people away. There was no line, restaurant was pretty empty, plus it was between lunch and dinner."
,,,,,"The service was outstanding. And she made it a point to let us know the pizza would take 20 minutes, and reminded us that it was on it's way a couple of times. Super nice and helpful. She helped us pick our personal pizzas. Checked on us several times."
,,,,,The pizzas were delicious. We liked the sauce (not to sweet nor heavy on spices) and the crust is buttery. Perfect. 
,,,,,"I do not think this type of pizza would do very well as a delivered item. You need to eat this fresh out of the oven. Maybe if you can heat it up properly at home? But the cheese (although not too much), was gooey and was melting, and it was a perfect layer of crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. "
,,,,,The personal pan size plus a shared salad was perfect for the two of us. 
,,,,,"If we had leftovers, would definitely have asked the best way to heat it up because the crust needs to be somewhat the same consistency."
,,,,,"Eating deep dish pizzas around the country, I can see why people may prefer their own city's style since it may be less flaky, or sweeter, or have heavier spices. To me, this classic is the foundation for deep dish pizza. As I am told by every native in Chicago, Lou's is the OG of deep dish."
,,,,,"So a visit to Chicago warrants a Deep Dish pizza consumption. A local friend chose this place as his earlier two suggestions were going to take forever to deliver, and Lou, he said, is good enough. And that sums up my experience- Good enough. "
,,,,,"We ordered a large deep dish ""Lou"" pizza for three people as two of us were vegetarians. First glances, pretty good! It looked like a good Deep Dish pizza. Taste wise, it was average. I would have liked to have more toppings. My friend observed that the amount of mushrooms and spinach was reduced. We aren't sure if that's a one-off thing. "
,,,,,"The Deep Dish aspect in itself wasn't bad, and that was the only aspect that worked for me. The crust is great. Also, it wasn't veryyyyyyy cheesy and had a good sauce flavor. However, I'm not into a plain Margherita style pizza so the lack of enough toppings didn't do it for me."
,,,,,"Unpopular opinion: reporting here from 2021's state with best pizza - NJ! Ya'll I was skeptical about trying deep-dish pizza, but I had to do it being in Chicago for the first time. My expectations were real low; however, I have to admit I was ever-so-pleasantly surprised. I was proven wrong by this delicious custom deep dish with butter crust. Heaven in each bite. Dare I say, better than many pies I've had in NJ. Not the best looking pizza, but boy does it hit the spot. My husband and I shared the bruschetta (amazing!) and a small pie with veggies and light cheese (still cheesy!) and it was filling! Keep in mind that the deep dish pies take approximately 45 minutes to cook, but believeeee me, it is worth the wait."
,,,,,"Such a a nice location, staff, and ambiance. The pizza was good and served with care, but I think it didn't live up to the deep dish hype. The crust was a bit soggy and without taste, and most of the cheese falls off as you pull a slice. I definitely recommend for the historic value, and quality since prices are fair and portions are filling."
,,,,,Best deep dish pizza in town! Keep in mind that it does take 30 minutes to get a pizza out since everything is freshly made. Definitely worth the wait for such a famous pizzeria! 
,,,,,I highly recommend the Malnati Chicago Classic Pizza. It comes with heaping portions of sauce filled to the brim with cheese. They definitely don't skimp on the sausage. Even a small size is good enough for two people. 
,,,,,"Overall, my experience here was fantastic. The food was great, and the server was such a nice guy! I can't recommend this spot enough."
,,,,,"Did a google search on best Chicago deep dish pizza and this came up. Seriously one of the best. We ordered the small deep dish pizza. Perfect for 2 people. The waiter was super funny, he was amazing. Love it indeed."
,,,,,"We came to Lou Malnati's Pizzeria on Saturday, September 4th at about 7pm with a party of four.  "
,,,,,"We tried this location five years ago, when we first visited Chicago together.  We knew this was going to be another busy holiday weekend, so we tried to not make the same mistakes as last time."
,,,,,"We joined the wait list at about 5:40PM and the wait was about 40 minutes.  In actual minutes, the wait ended up being about 70 minutes from the time we joined the wait list."
,,,,,"We were seated and the saving grace was our server, who was awesome, friendly and tried her best to make us feel comfortable.  However, the rest of the staff was just demoralizing and made us feel like we were unwelcome in the establishment.  "
,,,,,"The first thing the hostess says to us when we arrived is ""Did you preorder?"".  We said no, and she make it seem like we should have.  Before our true server showed up, someone else showed up to our table and asked why we didn't preorder.  It was so confusing.  Supposedly this is a thing; however, I went back again and looked on the website. There is no mention of dine in guests being given the option to pre-order.  When you place an order, the options are pick-up or delivery.  There is no mention in or around the wait list page that gives you the option to pre-order."
,,,,,"Anyway, we ordered by 7:10PM.  We ordered one medium deep dish (half sausage and half create your own), as well as a small thin crust."
,,,,,"I guess I understand why they ask you to pre-order.  It was 8:25PM and our pizza still did not arrive (1 hour and 15 minutes later).  We were never told it would take this long at all.  Finally, we inquired and told the server unfortunately we had to take it to go, so we were not late for our next engagement at 9:15PM.  "
,,,,,"We did get to eat the pizza later at about 11:30PM.  However, I am astonished at how terrible it was prepared.  The pizza was prepared with large chunks of tomato, hundreds of them.  I hate large chunks of tomato and only like tomato sauce.  The description on the menu says tomato sauce.  Some of the pizzas use sliced tomato; however, ours was described as sauce and not chunks of tomato."
,,,,,"Overall, just a bad experience.  I'm disappointed to say that I paid for this and was treated like crap -- like I didn't know what I was doing -- despite nothing on the website or during the process letting me know of the challenges I would be facing."

,,,,,"As visitors to Chicago, this seems to be one of three main pizza places that both locals and visitors enjoy visiting,  We tried two of the three and this was our least favorite of the two.  "
,,,,,"Now we know, people's opinions vary on the deep dish pizza subject in Chicago; however, this is our opinion.  "
,,,,,Compared to the other place we tried (see our other review) we found this pizza to be lacking in so many departments.  
,,,,,"First of all, what did we enjoy?  We enjoyed the fact that you could order ahead and then pick it up.  When we arrived at 8:15PM for our pick-up order on Saturday, September 3rd the wait was over 2.5 hours.  Not only was the sidewalk blocked creating a safety hazard; however, people were ordering to go and then sitting on the sidewalk outside and eating, creating a mini camp of sorts.  It was really weird."
,,,,,"Anyway, we picked up our pizza (a small) for two and then took a Lyft to Navy Pier and ate there.  "
,,,,,"We found the crust to be plain (compared to the other place we reviewed), we found that there was virtually no sauce, and we found the pizza just to be rather plain and not that great tasting.  "
,,,,,"Again, our opinion; however, not impressed."
,,,,,"My friend visited and wanted ""authentic Chicago pizza,"" so we went to Lou Malnatis-- the wait staff were perfectly nice, but I'll be honest that the food tastes like trash. Apps are meh. Pizza was left mostly uneaten. "

Personals are only available in the deep dish style pizzas. The small thin crust spinach was good as well. I'd recommend trying this spot out when in the area."
,,,,,"We came here after we checked into our hotel and was told that it was about an hour wait to be seated. It was Saturday around 2pm. So we decided to order a deep dish pizza to-go. It took less than an hour but pizza never tastes as good as it does when it comes fresh out the oven. By the time I got to eat it, it wasn't hot anymore. The cheese wasn't as melty. But my friends who ate it hot all said it tasted good. The crust was a bit too thick for me. I only ate the the toppings part."

,,,,,Cool restaurant for Chicago deep dish pizza.
,,,,,"The mozzarella sticks were nothing special, but the pizza was delicious.  Half the table ate the ""Lou"" which was spinach and garlic.  The rest of the table ate cheese.  Both were very good."
,,,,,"For deep dish, the pizza was a little smaller than I would have liked.  I wish it was twice as tall/thick.  That is the only down side, but it still was really good."
,,,,,There are signed jerseys on the walls.  We were seated by George H.W. Bush's signed Yale baseball jersey.
,,,,,"Do you also have that problem where one pack of ramen isn't enough, but two is too much? Because that's the exact problem I had at Lou Malnati's. It took me three years in Chicago to finally try the iconic slice (I know..) but yeah, I get the hype now."
,,,,,"It's not as overwhelming as I expected- truly a pizza ""pie"". There's plenty of filling, but wasn't a mouthful of tomato sauce. The dough is soft and chewy, and the cheese is perfectly melted. It's not the most amazing pizza I've tasted in my life, but no Chicago visit/life is complete without at least trying this famous slice/wedge!"
,,,,,"Be aware: it takes at least 45 minutes to make the pizza, so unless you're ready to wait, call ahead or order on the app!"
,,,,,"So I was forewarning about deep dish pizza not being so great, but I still wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Malnati Chicago Classic deep dish pizza in personal size, and honesty... I was not impressed. The pizza tasted a bit bland. Tomato sauce tasted very watery. The crust was probably the best part with fluffy breading and crispy edges. Nothing I would want to try again."
,,,,,"As a person coming from out of state, this cannot be ""the"" place to get a deep dish. Perhaps the shops expanded too quickly, cause the food was mediocre. I've had better deep dish outside Chicago. It was an average deep dish pie with above average pricing. Not worth the wait, nor the hype. Service was ok. I'd go somewhere else."
,,,,,"This is going to be an odd review because it's not about the pizza. We ordered only the Malnati's Salad and the Calamari ^.^ This is my second time eating the salad and it was just as I remembered it the first time. I think it might be the best salad I have ever eaten. Something about the lemon vinaigrette, salami bits, and fresh tomatoes that make the salad soooooo good!!!! The salami bits! I just want to eat it by myself but the medium definitely serves 2-3 person. The calamari was very tasty too with a splash of lemon. The breading was delicious. "
,,,,,I have tried the deep dish before and I remember it being good. I'm more of a garlic butter crust Pizza Hut kind of girl though.
,,,,,Good deep dish pizza but I'm specially in love with their house salad. Never had raw mushroom in salad before but it was delightful pairing with the delicious sweet dressing
,,,,,"When we where in Chicago last we got this pizza . Since then  I have had it delivered to me in Ca several times . We just absolutely love "" The Lou"" . We get it every time and it's the same amazing perfection of a pizza every singe time . The frozen pizza they ship out is also amazing and affordable. This is for sure our go to deep dish Chicago pizza ."

,,,,,"A classic Chicago pizzeria. Probably my favorite pizza in Chicago. We made reservations with a big party and were seated quickly. Our waiter was very friendly, but the food took a while to come out. Either way it was worth it for the quality and taste of the food. "

,,,,,- The Lou (5/5): love how buttery the crust is. Perfect ratio of bread to sauce to toppings. The veggies are so yummy. Pretty heavy but so good

,,,,,"Excellent Chicago style pizza! While, obviously, we came here for the famous "" Lou Manalti "" pizza, which lived up to its well-established reputation yet the lemon pepper wings were my standout! "
,,,,,"It was flavorful, fresh and excellent! I wished i ordered a second serving! The garlic parmesan was a close second! "
,,,,,"The waitress was so nice that when she scooped a slice of the  pizza to put on my plate before I could take a picture (for yelp, you know) I couldn't help but forgave her!!! She even dropped a portion of the cheese on the table and apologized for it---Ugh, because the pizza was great and the wings were excellent I can overlooked this mishap though I could have easily handed my 5 stars, which is achievable!"
,,,,,"I feel even bad writing this because I don't give such reviews. But I wanted to say what was on my mind. After a 21 hour trip I was thrilled when I finally got here. The actual restaurant was lovely. Clean. The staff was kind. They helped me choose between the 'Lou' and the Malnati special. I got the small special, around $22 (I was treating myself) and waited a little over 30 minutes. Which the staff had warned me about and I was ok with it. "
,,,,,"When I got back to my hotel room I opened the box and it looked amazing. Was still hot and had a cover over the top so the toppings wouldn't get stuck to the lid. I took my first bite and... Nothing. I took another. Same thing. This pizza had ZERO flavor. I felt like I was eating air. Was it me? I took a sip of my tea and it was sweet as usual. I had to ask for salt from the hotel. I ate this pizza but I have never tasted anything with nonexistent flavor in my life. I didn't eat it because I was enjoying it. I ate it because I don't throw food away. I apologize, but I would never recommend this."
,,,,,"You know, I'm not a fan of pizza, but I knew I had to try deep dish pizza in Chicago! Everyone talks about it being the best pizza ever, but I didn't know what they meant until..."
,,,,,"We walked in around 11am on a Saturday, and there was a 30 minute waiting list. We put ourselves on the list and then walked around. Actually, we got a Chick-fil-a salad because we (read: I) was already hungry. :P"
,,,,,"I got the personal-sized Lou: Spinach mix (w/ garlic, basil, onion), mushrooms, sliced roma tomatoes covered with three cheeses on Buttercrust. My partner ordered a drink for me because he knew I'd like it: Smoky Paloma - Casamigos mezcal, grand marnier, white grapefruit juice, splash of soda, lime wedge, pinch of chile lime salt. Just my kind of drink! "
,,,,,"But that buttercrust though!! I see why people love Lou's! The crust is crispy, leaving me wanting more. I even ate some of my partner's leftover crust :P The pizza itself was so cheesy, lots of stringy-ness! Coming from a non-pizza person, this was a surprise to me."
,,,,,"I also tried some of his personalized pizza - deep dish personal pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, sliced roma tomato, green peppers, onion. Also pretty good, although of course, I preferred mine!"
,,,,,"If I'm back in Chicago again, maybe I'll give the other G- pizza place a try! Or maybe I'll stick with Lou Malnati's for their ever-so-special crust :)"
,,,,,I tried this and I tried Peqoud's Chicago deep dish pizzas.
,,,,,And this place is by far a winner.
,,,,,We had the original and the veggie.
,,,,,"Beautiful tasty fresh, crispy with a chewy bite crust, fresh fillings. In my opinion, the pizza here definitely delivered on the Chicago deep dish hype. Definitely going back again"
,,,,,Deep dish pizza is a must try in Chicago and this place delivered! We got the classic pizza size small which was perfect for 2 people! It came out to about $20 for pizza and tax.
,,,,,"The sausage, cheese, and crust were so delicious and had the perfect mixture of soft and crispy textures. "
,,,,,"The pizza take about 30+ minutes to make so make sure to come in before you're hungry to account for the extra time. If you're already hungry, order an appetizer or other dish. The other dishes come out a lot quicker!"
,,,,,"Visiting Chicago and had to try the top rated deep dish pizza so Lou Malnati's was on the list! Our group of four placed an order for pick up not knowing how long the wait would be but there were plenty of tables available so we requested to eat at the outdoor patio, which they kindly allowed. "
,,,,,The small Lou's was a good size for a sample of deep dish pizza as we planned to have other small bites throughout the evening! The crust was cooked to perfection and tasted better than expected! The order was ready on time and the website was easy to navigate. Each pizza slice was quite filling so a small would be plenty for 2 for a meal! Very impressed with Lou's and appreciate them having so many locations making it easy to visit any time!

I had an individual cheese and my husband had the Chicago classic we were both so disappointed! They were both tasteless and looked like a Pizza Hut individual pizza. We went there cause there were so many great reviews. Pizza was bland and crust was tasteless. Definitely a one and done for me. Go to Giordano's, way better and drinks are cheaper."
,,,,,Worth the wait for some nice deep dish. Lived here a few years back but came back for a conference and I had to get my Malnati's fix.

,,,,,Late entry.  We decided on dessert.  The family agrees that the pizza cookie is a must have when visiting here.  It was delicious.
,,,,,"Had to try deep dish when in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed the personal sized sausage basil pizza from Lou Malnati's. We came in around midnight on a Saturday evening after catching a jazz show nearby, glad they are open late. Everything's baked fresh and nothing is pre made so be prepared to wait. We were told that it would take 25 mins for our fairly easy order to be ready but we didn't mind that. The sauce was so tasty and fresh and the crust itself had so much flavor. Service was excellent even though they were close to wrapping up for the day."
,,,,,"The deep dish here was the best I've ever had!! I got the standard cheese pizza but it was so much more than that. The amount of cheese, the stringiness of it, the flavors from the tomatoes and seasoning. It was a dream! Eating the pizza was like butter in your mouth in the best way. The crust was thin and crisp, the flavors of the pizza was on point. It was so filling and I'd definitely recommend coming here for pizza if you're visiting Chicago! The atmosphere was very welcoming and inviting and overall it was a great experience. There is also plenty of tables for those with large parties as well."
,,,,,"The pizza was delicious and fresh! I ordered from New York with Taste of Chicago and my ordered got messed up. However, this group went to great lengths to fix my order. THANK YOU!"
,,,,,"Yum!! First time trying Chicago deep dish and it was great! Really loved the sausage layer on the pizza - I like that they're not just meatball size and you have some in every bite. Just a heads up it takes about 30-35 to prepare the pizza so it'll be a bit of a wait. We got here around 12 and were seated indoors, not a lot of ppl in but by the time we left almost every table was occupied. "

,,,,,Our server Sean was friendly and attentive.
,,,,,"An out of town friend was visiting Chicago for the first time, so had to have deep dish pizza. Lou Malnati's does not take reservations,  but when we arrived on a Friday evening,  we were seated immediately.  The restraunt is decorated with many sports items, not Chicago related, but added a bit of character.  The restraunt has two levels and looks much bigger than you except when entering.  Our waiter Tony/Anthony was accommodating and provided detailed explanations of options. He thought we all were from out of town, so the explanations and helpful suggestions would have been useful if we had not eaten Lou's before. We started with the combo appetizer a variety of fried items.  It included zucchini,  mushrooms,  cheese curds, and mozzarella sticks. It included ranch and marina for dipping.  The variety was good .  The malnati salad is always my go to.  We always get the individual size, not family and it is more than enough for 4 to share. The sweet vinaigrette dressings is one of my all time favorites. For the pizza , we haf the Malnoti's Chicago Classic.  Tony/Anthony ( he introduced himself by both names) offered the option of the sausage as a patty or in pieces.  This was the first time we were offered an option even after numerous visits. The buttercrust is so good.  I often pick up the dough to make pizza at home, of course,  it never comes close to Lou's.   Overall, we were not disappointed and the food  remained consistent Lou's."
,,,,,"I got 2 frozen deep dish pizzas delivered through Goldbelly. It was well packed and nicely frozen. Compared to Pequod's pizza, these pizzas were lighter and faster to bake. Sausage pizza was my favorite. Pepperoni was good as well."
,,,,,"Delicious deep dish pizza!!!! We called ahead to give the restaurant a heads up that we were coming with a large group because they don't take reservations. When we got there, the place wasn't packed so we were able to get seated immediately. We took over three tables inside during lunch. The salad was delicious and the veggie deep dish was my favorite though I'm not vegetarian. I miss Chicago and the deep dish pizza there!!"

The Lou's, probably has something to do with the veggies. We did swap sausage for pepperoni on the Classic.  Delivery was great and we really enjoy the experience!"
,,,,,"Had my first deep dish pizza here! And as a New York pizza fan, I was surprised to discover how much I loved it. Two of us split a small with chicken sausage and pepperoni. The chicken was fantastic, and the sauce was seasoned well. Get the butter crust--it adds something special to the crust and keeps it crisp, when it seems like that much cheese and sauce would make it soggy. And we got it delivered, and it held up well. I really enjoyed this pizza (which is definitely like a casserole) and would order it again."
,,,,,"When in Rome...  This is like no other pizza we have ever had before. Whenever we travel, we always ask the locals ""What do you recommend?"" Word of mouth is what led us here. 1 1/2 hour wait time, and you wonder is this worth the wait? What else is in the area? All these people waiting, It mUst be good!?? So curiosity got the best of us, and we waited TESTIMONY TIME...Hot, heavy, Thick, lots of cheese, you could see the ingredients and didn't have to guess what they were. A mouthful!! If you love cheese, this is a MUST TRY! We really enjoyed the experience. Great food"
,,,,,July 2021 - COVID Review:
,,,,,"My first time having true, authentic deep dish pizza! "
,,,,,They were very understandably busy on a weekend and weren't accepting anymore dine in guests since they were a little over an hour from closing. 
,,,,,My husband and I ended up ordering takeout instead. The wait for a takeout pizza was at least 40 minutes though. So we ordered online before we left our hotel to be able to kill some time as we made our way over there. 
,,,,,We took our personal pizzas on a short walk over to the riverwalk and they were still nice and hot when we dug into them!
,,,,,"TBH I had no intention of coming here during my visit, but my coworker had strongly recommended this place and she's only ever tried the DIY goldbelly version. I love thin crust pizza so much, that the idea of deep dish sounded like a very soggy and un-crispy experience. I've never been proven more wrong in my life."
,,,,,"Wait time around 3pm on a Saturday for a table was about 1.5 hours, so we ordered it to-go instead. To-go also took a while - 45 min, but I read somewhere it actually takes 45 min to make/bake the pizza, meaning if we got a table we would've had to wait 1.5 hour + 45 min to get the pizza! We tried a Malnati's Chicago Classic, and built our own (double pepperoni). We ate this at some tables along the riverwalk (about 5-7 min walk)."
,,,,,"The crust was so crispy, and nothing about this pizza was soggy at all. The flavor and crust texture was out of this world! Thin crust is still my number 1 but this is a close second!"
,,,,,I also really appreciated that they had personal and small sizes so we didn't have to commit to a full size pizza and be left with a bunch of leftovers.
,,,,,The one thing I was looking forward to on my trip to chi city was THIS!!!!! I was so hyped up about trying this deep dish spot over the one I had years ago! 
,,,,,"We had about an hour wait since we didn't make Ressys! We waited obvi, who leaves without having deep dish pizza?  Amriteee?? So, we were seated in at corner table and our server did not come for about 20 mins! Ok fine. Then she comes and we ordered right away our soda and wings and pizza. We still have no water. There we other people being seated after us and getting their water and food! Okay. We get our soda about 30 mins after and still no food! At this point, I was starving like getting so hungry I was about to get up and leave! We asked another waiter twice to get our server but there was too busy attending others. We get our wings and have to wait another 15 mins to get our pizza. We ordered a kids size.... What the hell!  "
,,,,,"For a restaurant that's so well known, I def did not expect this! Very disappointed !"
,,,,,This pizza was absolutely delicious!!! I've had Chicago deep dish only at Giordano's and this is hands down 10 times better!! I got the Chicago classic and it was cheesy and so flavorful! I don't think I could ever go somewhere else! I got the fruity juice cocktail and it was also delicious and refreshing!
,,,,,This was the first place I ate on my weekend trip to Chicago and I was mostly disappointed by the service not the food.
,,,,,"First and Foremost, MAKE A RESERVATION. We added ourselves to the waitlist and it was a 40 min wait to get seated."
,,,,,"Secondly, Preorder your pizza on the weekends. Once we were seated they asked us if we preorder our pizza and of course we hadn't. As soon as we were seated our server told us the pizza were taking about 50 mins to come out. :| "
,,,,,We ordered a small pizza almost immediately and got a bruschetta in the mean time. The bruschetta was very good and it was a god serving size. We waited for nearly an hour and a half to get our pizza but it was hot and it was a lot of food for two women. I personally do not like deep dish pizza but this one was very good. They are heavy in the meat and cheese and much lighter on the sauce than other places.
,,,,,"It was after 10pm when we finished eating and we were ready to pay and our server was no where to be found. It took another 20 mins just to pay. When they  took are cards they ""misplaced"" them and we were accusing us of never giving them payment. They ""found"" our cards moments later. Very funky situation."
,,,,,"The personal pizza is great, restaurant feels a little touristy but the food is great."
,,,,,Been here in 2015 and finally making a review!
,,,,,Every time we come to Chicago we always stop by Lou Malnati's and bring their frozen deep dish pizzas back home to the Bay Area friends to share and try. When we bring home the frozen pizzas we put them in the oven to bake and head up and we add extra butter on the bottom of the pan. It just makes  the crust even more buttery. 
,,,,,"We choose our toppings for our deep dish and had pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and extra cheese! The crust is so buttery and creamy -- plus the cheese is so cheesy and creamy as well and has a good cheese pull."
,,,,,"Their pizza's are delicious, tasty, and authentic. You simply cannot go wrong with their deep dish pizzas and you will definitely be coming back and craving it!"
,,,,,We also tried some of their salads and it paired nice with the pizza since the pizzas were very hearty and dense.
,,,,,The last time we were here we had Lou Malnatis one day and the next day we ended up making a Togo order and bringing more pizzas back to the hotel because we were craving it.
,,,,,I cannot wait to come back to Chicago to eat here!

,,,,,"Beautiful exhibits with helpful and friendly staff. Great place to dodge the cold and learn something new in downtown. It's a short walk away from Millennium Park, it has interesting rotation exhibits from all around the world, and there is definitely something for everyone. Got through what we wanted to see in a couple of hour's time (all that we had, sadly), but you could have easily spent a half day-a full day in this museum, depending on your interest in art. Would recommend! The membership seems like a lovely thing to have, especially if you like modern and contemporary art."
,,,,,My mother brought me to The Art Institute of Chicago since I was a child. Memories of being among great art go way way back :-) it always seems like time standstill when you're walking the galleries. Must see for anyone who's visiting Chicago or even for people who live here and just need a day of fine art.
,,,,,Are you kidding me? One of the best museums I've ever been to anywhere in the world! And I've been to a LOT of 'em.
,,,,,"Lovely museum. I came here by myself while waiting for a friend, and blown away by the amount of content. They are open late on Thursdays (until 8p) and the price isn't too bad if you are a student. The cashier adds a $1 for the coat check when you buy the ticket, so no need to carry cash. Obvi no food inside."
,,,,,"The space is nicely designed and has a lot of rest areas, which my feet were extremely thankful for. I didn't realize there were a lot more modern and contemporary content upstairs; I personally would have started there. I was only here for a couple hours but the museum was sadly closing. Try to allocate about 3 hours."
,,,,,I was very impressed by the impressionist collection with works from Degas and Monet. I would have loved to see more representation of East Asian Art here.
,,,,,Definitely recommend if you are visiting Chicago!
,,,,,"I stopped by the Art Institute of Chicago in early March, so this review is long past due.  "
,,,,,"First of all, this museum is very large.  You really need to come on multiple days to see everything.  It's simply impossible to see everything in one visit, especially without being rushed."
,,,,,Their modern wing is simply amazing.  There is a wide range of modern art and it's all inspiring.
,,,,,"They have everything you can imagine, from ancient, Egyptian, sculptures, paintings, installations, experimental, marble sculptures, Roman era pieces, ancient Greek era, textiles, and a very expansive photography exhibit.  "
,,,,,"Honestly, this is one of the best art museums I have ever been to in my entire life.  They offer tours, which is very interesting and I may do one next time I visit."
,,,,,"When they open again from COVID, I will absolutely take another day and visit again.  There is simply so much more to see."
,,,,,"FYI, this museum is just steps away from THE BEAN, which I've gone to and it's just a great location, right in the heart of downtown."
,,,,,Certainly one of the top art museums in the world.  It is truly fabulous with easy access to many of world's masterpieces.  Be sure to wear your walking shoes.  The museum is huge and probably not the best place to show off those fancy new Jimmy Choo's (though he might even have a place here some day). 
,,,,,"We have been members here on and off for years.  It really pays if there is just one of the special exhibits you want to see.  There have been many for us over the years.  Most recently we went to see the Warhol exhibit.  If you have a chance it is really terrific.  Even if you are not a fan it is worthwhile.  I learned so much from the exhibit.  But here lies my little beef.  Now, you can listen to the audio guide through the app (no extra charge).  Unfortunately I don't think they have the kinks worked out of it yet. Four of us went and we all tried to use it.  Three gave up. I persevered and finally got the hang of it about half way through.  Even then it wasn't perfect.  It was difficult to navigate through the audio in order and also listen to the special numbered exhibits which required you get out of order on the audio map.  Software needs some work."
,,,,,Came for the Andy Warhol exhibit. It was awesome! And all the other art was cool too
,,,,,If you have a Chicago Library you can her passes for 2 adults and 2 children or come on Thursdays and it's free for all Illinois residents
,,,,,"Wow and WOW!  My draw to Art is not particularly strong, but I do like a good museum of just about anything. "
,,,,,We were in town coincidentally with the opening of the Andy Warhol exhibit. So off we went. The line was long but less than 20 minutes wait. Coat check is available. The are volunteers everywhere that will happily direct you. 
,,,,,"This Museum is huge. We had Pre-agreed to hit Warhol first. The exhibit is massive. I flew through it in about 3.5 hours. It deserves so much more, even from art Hicks like me. It is put together perfectly and includes all of his art forms. I learned all sorts of things from this Exhibit. "
,,,,,"There is 90% more  to AIC. I only saw the most famous of the pieces, being restless to see other sites. My biggest regret is not having 3 more days in town just to truly see AIC."
,,,,,"I had a wonderful time visiting the Art Institute yesterday! It's always so much fun seeing my favorite paintings on display there, in addition to appreciating some classic Hollywood history there. It's a delight to have so many beautiful pieces exhibited in the same lovely building. Moreover, I enjoy being moved by different works of art. Seeing prints and pictures of these pieces online just isn't the same."
,,,,,Wow! Wow! One of the premiere museums of the world. Masterpieces all around and even if you are not that much into art you'll recognize some of these gems. Situated right in mellinium park it is very easy to get to within downtown chicago via train or bus. The line to get in wasn't too bad and it flowed quickly. About 10 min. midweek in autumn.
,,,,,"The layout of the museum is great. Easily walkable to each exhibit and genre. The highlights for me were the Monet, Van Gough, Edward Hopper, and sculptures. Feel free to imitate your favorite Ferris Bueller scene. You'll definitely get a lot of amazement and culture from some of these great priceless works of art."
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"This is another one of those places that is so amazing, that I don't have enough superlatives to describe it. The place is so huge, and filled to the brim with incredible art, that half a day is barely enough to scratch the surface."
,,,,,"My only complaint, if I had one, is that even with maps I kept getting lost and had trouble finding the exhibits I wanted to see. Plus, I felt like the restrooms were a little too hidden."
,,,,,"Other than that, being able to see original art by the world's most famous and talented artists was definitely awe-inspiring. I love that I could get so close to the pieces and really study the details.  Another benefit to the place being so large is that no one area was so crowded that I couldn't take all the time I needed to ogle a masterpiece."
,,,,,"My favorite piece of all was the Chagall's America Windows exhibit. It was hidden in kind of out of the way place, but it is 100% worth it to find it.  Wow!"
,,,,,"It's sooo big...I regret not coming here earlier...if I had longer time to stay, we would have stayed longer...but we did this in 2 hours. "
,,,,,"The line is long...we got the Chicago Explorer Pass, so it counts as fast pass, go to the receptionist and he'll exchange it into tickets for you. Skip the whole line and save some time for some art! The ticketing lady did not tell us this and she was super rude. The guy who helped us was super nice though. "
,,,,,"There were many rooms and 3 floors. We initially took our time but noticed the time and had to go to dinner, so we started scanning through each room and couldn't read everything. The art work in here is cool- they had a Van Gogh room...we aren't art-loving people (but we enjoy seeing it) so we weren't sure if the paintings in there were the real deal because there's a Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam...do they share or something? Also the sculptures in the Asia exhibit were awesome...again we questioned the authenticity of it but asked a staff and she confirmed everything here is original and that just blew our minds!!! Crazy how well they are able to preserve it. We are glad we asked and came to see actual art!"
,,,,,"More photos from one of my ""Fav"" places to visit in Chicago ..."
,,,,,The Art Institute.  
,,,,,"Thursday evenings has free entry for Chicago residents so the place was quite crowded.  I explored the Greek Art , Asian Art , European Art , "
,,,,,"Impressionist Art etc. I took photos of exquisite mosaic floor tiles found in homes of the wealthy Romans. Took photos of Buddha , Hindu gods with many faces , Chagall's America's Windows ( stained glass ) , colorful Vases , "
,,,,,"The sculpture of the Pieta , Christian Art , Armored Knights jousting , and finally beautifully designed Cabinets in Black & White. Oh , and bad boy Cupid being spanked   "
,,,,,"Hope everyone enjoys the photo array.  If ever in Chicago , visit the Art Institute of Chicago.  It is world class.  You will find Monet and Manet ..."
,,,,,Henri de Toulouse - Lautrec ... Chagall ... Renoir ... Rodin ... et al. 
,,,,,Come see what I see ...  Chicago - City in a Garden ... 
,,,,,filled with Art & Architecture.  Welcome to Chicago !
,,,,,THE ART PALACE 
,,,,,"One of my ""Go to"" places in Chicago. This is a world class Art Palace. "
,,,,,We went there last week and the Palace was swarming with Art lovers. 
,,,,,I have been going to the Palace for four decades now and I still enjoy viewing world class Art. 
,,,,,"I must add however that back in the day, when it was just an Art ""Institute"", it was much more affordable.  Now that it is an Art ""Palace"" the plebes must pay the rent.  Everyone knows that the rent always goes up.  Now days it is quite high. There are also additional cost for Audio Phone guides and special exhibits.  Garage parking in downtown Chicago is an added expense.  It can be an expensive day, so get there early and make the most of it. "
,,,,,NOTE : Free Admission to Illinois residents on Thursday evenings between 5:00 pm and 8:00 pm. 
,,,,,"As for the exhibits, one could spend all day here viewing various forms and styles of Art.  There are paintings , sculptures, vases, TIFFANY glass, "
,,,,,"Modern Art, Greco-Roman, Christian Byzantine Art, Impressionist , Rococo , Japanese, Chinese, etc. "
,,,,,"Artist such as Van Gogh, Manet, Matisse , Monet, Picasso, and my fav,"
,,,,,"Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, et al. "
,,,,,"There is a dinning section for those in need of a lunch break and there is adequate seating scattered about for those in need of a rest.  Or, here is a thought, one could pause and be seated to just stare at a favorite work of Art for as long as on desires.  Well, at least until closing, harrumph !"
,,,,,I love the Art Institute!  Interesting collection.  Worth going back to again and again.  Everytime I do I notice new things.
,,,,,"Absolutely one of the best museums I've been too! Absolutely beautiful and a variety of artists throughout the entire world. Being a student myself and seeing the art I've studied in world history, and women in art- I was able to better connect to the artists themselves and recognize their pieces of art. Absolutely worth the entire experience from start to finish. Here are some of the current paintings! Enjoy"
,,,,,"Ah yes, a Chicago staple. I hadn't been here since I was a kid on a field trip, so a visit was overdue. "
,,,,,"Be warned that you have to pay to check bags, but I didn't mind that bit. "
,,,,,"The layout is confusing but there's maps available and pretty good signage to help you navigate your way. I was nursing an injury and had to sit frequently. I was very relieved with just how many benches there were, as that's not the case in all museums. "
,,,,,"The staff was a bit off putting. There were workers who were overbearing and lecturing to captive audiences, which was a bit much. Then there was the security guard who was breathing down the neck of anyone who was under the age of 40. Art museums are quiet, contemplative places. It's really uncomfortable to be trying to admire art in a small room with a dude just staring you down from two feet away. "
,,,,,"The piece I most wanted to see was on loan, which was disappointing but it happens with all the museums so, I understood. "
,,,,,"This is a place worth going to if you're visiting the city, or if you're a fan of art or history. Just be aware of some staffing issues; it's not a dealbreaker, but I hope you get a better experience with them."
,,,,,"What a fantastic museum.  It's located in Millennium Park.  It's Open daily 10:30-5:00, Thursdays until 8:00.  Buy your tickets online before going in order to avoid the lines.  They offer discounts for Chicago residents.  For those visiting from out of town, it's $25 for general admission or $35 for the fast pass (Fast Pass allows visitors to bypass the general admission lines at entrances and offers access to the museum's galleries and nonticketed exhibitions).  Fast pass was worth it alone to avoid the line getting into the museum.  "
,,,,,"The art is separate by genre and/or artist: modern wing, photography, mini rooms, Islamic art, textiles, paperweights, asian art, african art, american art, greek/roman/byzantine art, folk art, european art, medieval/renaissance, contemporary, modern...  The exhibits are fantastic and museum is artwork in itself.  The museum is gorgeous.  Additionally, we went on a Saturday and although there were lots of people in the museum, it was not overly crowded.  "
,,,,,Definitely recommend this museum.  It's one of the best I've been to.
,,,,,Saw the museum for about 1.5 hours. Just the right amount of time to see all the highlights at a leisurely pace. Definitely could easily spend another 60-90 minutes here just exploring the European Art section. 
,,,,,Interior is modern and spacious. Each gallery area has its own theme to go with the art. 
,,,,,"American Gothic, Monet water lilies, Nighthawks were definitely the highlights for me. "
,,,,,Purchased the Sky tower & Art Institute combo pass in person. Saves about $6 and includes fast pass to sky deck in Willis Tower.
,,,,,"The Art Instute of Chicago is a vast, intriguing, provocative museum that has something for everyone.  They have art from all eras, ranging from Impressionism to contemporary to  African art.  There is a neat medieval renaissance exhibit tucked in a back corner with horses, armor, and weapons. . There was a gorgeous collection of Middle Eastern and Muslim fabrics, jewels, and artifacts on display while we were there.  There are also sculptures, Greek art, oriental art, Indian art.  There is something for everyone.  There are also really good audio tours.  This is part of the Chicago City Pass, which is a great value:  the art museum, Hancock and Willis tower, The science museum, the planetarium, etc.  This museum is a must do."
,,,,,"Til this day, I am blown away at the collections this museum holds. It is completely under-appreciative of what treasures are displayed at this museum, if you have the chance to go - go."
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,I haven't been to the Art Institute in forever. It's sad that we don't take advantage of our wonderful city. FYI.... The museum is Free on Thursday's and it's a $1.00 charge to check in your coat and book bags or any other carrying items that you bring into the Art Institute. 
,,,,,"There are so many wonderful masterpieces all in one building. I was truly impressed with the exhibits and art pieces. One of my favs was The Deering Family Galleries of Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and Armor. The exhibit was well displayed."
,,,,,Memorable experience but a bit exhausting trying to absorb in so much in one day. Even though you are giving a guide it's still a little confusing trying to navigate yourself through the maze. I have to come back to finish off where I left. Very interesting and informative information.
,,,,,The only negative thing is that some of the staff's are rude. As your walking along the museum there is one of two staff members in each of the rooms. It's so sad that they just stare at you no hello welcome nothing but cold hard stares at people. But negative vibes and people don't steal my joy.  It's a wonderful museum with amazing collections and paintings  from all over the world. It's well worth the visit.  One of the most recommended museums in Chicago. It's a work of Art
,,,,,It's a shame that I don't take advantage more often of what Chicago has to offer.  As usual it takes an out of town guest (in this case my brother from Berkley CA) to go to one of the best art museums in the world.  What more can I say because if you've been to The Art Institute of Chicago you know exactly what I'm talking about.  
,,,,,"They have an awesome collection that has permanent residency in the museum, but they also change up exhibits so there is always some new exhibits.  The last time I was their there was an exhibit on Chinese art.  This time the same hall had an exhibit from The Japanese Ukiyo or Floating Pillow World was there in place of the Chinese Art.  We also walked through an exhibit that had a ton artifacts Arts of Southeast Asia that was interesting.  I wish we had a little more time, but tomorrow's another day"
,,,,,The Art Institute of Chicago is a world class art museum that houses one of the finest art collections in the world.  We are so fortunate to have this in our city and very few people ever take advantage of what we have myself included.  
,,,,,Yesterday we met some friends that we haven't seen in several years and had lunch in the basement cafeteria.  After lunch we had about 90 minutes peruse some of the works in the modern art gallery.  
,,,,,Now I don't pretend to be an art expert.  I found some of the pieces very interesting and some just plain bizarre.  I guess every artist has his or her own thought process when they start working on  their pieces.
,,,,,Very impressed how organized and adaptive museum is to not so easy times.
,,,,,Love the sms feature  - system seems to be working perfect ! I do have membership - so not sure if my experience different than someone who just purchase the single entry ticket .
,,,,,This was spectacular! There quite a few people in here but this was so great! So much to see and never a rush to get through! Will definitely visit them again!
,,,,,"It's a world-class art museum, one of the best in the world. The traveling exhibits are usually excellent, but the expansive collection is always worth a lengthy visit. Just wandering into a gallery and randomly coming across the original version of a painting you've seen copies of your whole life is pretty thrilling."
,,,,,"Absolutely one of the best museum experiences you can have in Chicago, and Illinois as a whole. So many masterpieces. It's definitely difficult to manage time, there's so much to see. So plan ahead do you know what you want to do/see before you get there. Buy your tickets in advance to save time! If you have kids, do a journey maker in the family room, then use the journey maker to decide what you see. I always love that the JOURNEYMAKER leads us to pieces that we haven't seen before, and we've been here many many many times!"
,,,,,Review for the Art Institute of Chicago
,,,,,"I've attended events at the Art Institute of Chicago while growing up in the West Suburb.  Revel as a world class art museum along Michigan Avenue, at the heart of Downtown Chicago!"
,,,,,This is always such a wonderful experience. Everything is just a feast for your soul and so inspirational. 
,,,,,My brother visiting from Cal. Was ever so kind and purchased a membership. So along with Mark and Phil S and Joji S. We went in our merry way and explored this magnificent world class art intituite it's very large and we spent around 4 hours on the first floor and had coffee in the members lounge before we explored the Greek and Roman sculptures followed by Chagall and the Asian art. . 
,,,,,I will have to bring my kids here soon and friends and take advantage of this wonderful gift. !!
,,,,,So amazing! We really enjoyed this visit. The only reason for it not being a 6 (just being silly) is because we couldn't see the special exhibit due to it being sold out. Boooo. We enjoyed every second.
,,,,,"Art institute of Chicago, this place is just perfect! I'm telling you all, for people that loves visualizing, or just simply view the beautiful arts created with such wonderful people, this is the best place for you to go to! And as an artist myself that had always been so fascinated by the neat and immaculate works of others, this is the place for me. The place is quite big and if you go inside, it is quite a quiet place, very calming and peaceful! The place itself is already a neat view, very organized and highlighted with artworks very pleasing to the eyes. I also have masterpiece for more than a century ago and this art institute brought that touch of beauty to the area it is in.  The masterpieces inside are truly a work of art, a true masterpiece. By far one of the best art gallery I had ever been to.! I definitely recommend this place very much and for those fellow artist like me, this is the best place, definitely! Thank you!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,What an amazing art museum we have here in Chicago!!! And it's mammoth! We spent 4 hours there and didn't even venture down several wings - so allow plenty of time and plan on returning. 
,,,,,"The Impressionist Wing here rivals d'Orsay in Paris. Their Monet collection from every period of his life could almost be it's own museum with Renoir close behind. So many classics from all the Impressionist masters are housed here. Then there's the Modern Wing with Warhol, Jackson Pollack, Dali, Picasso. The American Wing houses Early American furniture pieces as well as art and beautiful sculpture with an exceptional Remington collection. "
,,,,,"So much to enjoy, absorb & feast your eyes upon in here! Take your time and enjoy this beautiful treasure at our fingertips."
,,,,,"I've been to many of the world's best art museums from the Louvre and Musée D'Orsay (still my all time favorite) in Paris to the Uffizi in Florence, the Metropolitan and MoMA in NYC, several in San Francisco, the Warhol, the Picasso, even  Amsterdam (fabulous Van Gogh museum), the National in Taipei and so many more. You would think that with that much cultural stimulation I'd be a lot more refined. But I digress. "
,,,,,"It took me a year and a half after moving to Chicago to make it to the Art Institute. After visiting there for nearly 4 hours yesterday, I'm embarrassed to admit it took me that long. Wow. WOW. I knew it was huge but never dreamed it was that big and packed full of so many incredible pieces. And after 4 hours I didn't put a dent in it. Probably saw 1/3 of what was on exhibit. The Impressionist gallery is superb, the American collection of paintings, early furniture, and other pieces was incredible. From sculpture to modern art, contemporary art, prints, ethnic pieces, this place has it all. And it's all laid out in an incredible building that is itself a work of art. What an incredible resource this place is and to think it's so accessible. "
,,,,,"If you haven't been, go. If you've been, go again. I know for sure I will. Maybe that cultural infusion will finally take hold...."
,,,,,"Lovely, if not crowded, sites. During COVID expect wait times until full capacity is back. Special exhibits are hit or miss, but some under-appreciated gems like the Southeast Asian Arts hall are fantastic. Don't expect to see The Great Wave - it's on display like every four years."
,,,,,"The Art Institute should be ashamed of themselves for how they treated the volunteer docents  by firing them from giving tours and sharing their knowledge with visitors.  It is age discrimination plain and simple! Retired people have time to volunteer, while younger people have to work in hopes they can retire some day.  They will never see a dime from me again!  I've written to the Bank of America and Chase CEO's encouraging them not to give a dime to the Art Institute.   Anybody else we can complain too?"
,,,,,"Their collection is INSANE. Recommend allotting more than 3 hours at this museum just to scratch the surface on what artworks they feature. Crazy museum, you turn the corner, and see a masterpiece. 10/10 definitely recommend visiting."
,,,,,"Love coming here, don't come often but if it's an art exhibit worth seeing and or I  come on their free nights it's always a treat to explore and look around the the various exhibits to see paintings, sculptures, and or photographs! One of my favorite art galleries! Previously went to the Warhol exhibit and loved it!!"
,,,,,"Always a great experience here. I can never get through each exhibit in one visit. This museum is full of history and dedication to art. I love that educators can get in free. The museum gift shops are pricey, but that is to be expected. Be prepared to walk a lot."
,,,,,"What can I say about such a world class museum other than it is indeed world class!  I have been able to travel the world a fair bit and always love going to my ""hometown"" museum!"
,,,,,"I love this place. As an Illinois resident, I enjoy free entry on Thursday evenings. So much history and culture is housed in this building. "
,,,,,The art was collected with the public in mind. Why should only the wealthy and powerful have access to timeless art?
,,,,,Everyone should take advantage of this iconic Chicago landmark and institution.
,,,,,One of the best art museums in the country - with only the Met beating it out for the top spot.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"Too big. I FINISHED the art section, turn around and there is more art. I asked an employee where the bathroom was and they didn't know. They checked a map for me I didn't ask them to do that. $25 who am I Daddy Warbux, Get outta dodge."
,,,,,"We were disappointed to read that the Art Institute of Chicago ""let go"" of all of their 82 docents.  We don't think that this was very cool."
,,,,,"That's a really great place! they have a big collection of masterpieces of different epochs from all parts of the world. You can spend full two hours just roaming there, observing pictures, statues and many other things. The price is not low, though I recommend spending time on visit"
,,,,,A whole lotta art. Easy to navigate museum. Quiet and calm setting. Enjoyed seeing the art work.
,,,,,Everyone was extremely helpful with every question. Immensely friendly environment. The Obama and Michelle exhibit was a bit crowded which is completely understandable. Would definitely go again.
,,,,,"There's a reason that The Art Institute is considered one of the greatest museums in the world. Chicago, and it's Gilded Age aristocrats, were world leaders in American culture and the art scene. Thanks to benefactors like Bertha Palmer, we have some of the grandest Impressionist work outside of Paris. You could spend weeks here viewing art from all around the world in different mediums. There truly is something for everyone. There's special tours if you're limited on time, just ask for the brochure or look it up online. It helps you hit the MUST SEES in a short amount of time."
,,,,,"Whether you are an art lover or not, whether you are being dragged here against your will by your loved ones, I guarantee you that you will be surprised by how much you will enjoy spending a few hours here. The Art Institute of Chicago is a must-visit."
,,,,,"My son's favorite part of the museum is the medieval and renaissance period with armors and swords during the 1600 and 1700 century. I have a love for modern art and photography. And my husband enjoys interesting sculptures. I can't help but notice other people admiring and making comments as they walk around. Some look perplexed, some amused and some look like they totally get what the artist is trying to say. Take your time and explore this museum room by room and you're bound to learn something amazing."
,,,,,"As we exited the museum, my son realized that we did not visit the lower level which featured 68 Thorne miniature rooms. They allowed us to reenter the museum with our tickets. I am so glad that we didn't miss this exhibit. It happened to be all of our favorite. The miniature rooms are a sight to see."
,,,,,All the staff and security guards are super friendly. Coat checks are $1 a coat/jacket. A good idea if you don't want to hold onto to your jackets while exploring the museum.
,,,,,One of the best offerings in the city! Amazing gift store that you can access without paying for admission. Always have amazing exhibits that are a must see!
,,,,,"Absolutely love the Art Institute. They have one of the best impressionist art galleries in the US. I also love their special exhibitions, like the Monet and Obama Portraits. We have an absolute gem of an art museum here."
,,,,,A must if you're in chicago!
,,,,,Is one of my favorite museums now. Amazing collection. Can't wait to visit again
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,The institute should be ashamed of their racist tactics  against volunteers who have spent decades and shared decades of knowledge with art lovers.   Quit with the woke bullshit.
,,,,,You need 2-3 days tops to see everything.
,,,,,It is amazing and so much art.
,,,,,But my most favorite is the miniature section.
,,,,,I could spend hours in there. Everything is SO detailed.
,,,,,Love this place.
,,,,,A must visit when in Chicago. Usually for me it's an all day outing. Today I had about an hour and a half to kill so I just went for the current exhibit. This was a wonderful way to do it and I'll try to do that more often.
,,,,,"* I STARTED THIS REVIEW A LONG, LONG TIME AGO*. "
,,,,,Since then I've been back multiple times. This world class museum has so much to offer that you can visit a lot and still see new things. They always have wonderful special exhibits. They also have a very fine gift shop.
,,,,,A must visit when in Chicago. Usually for me it's an all day outing. Today I had about an hour and a half to kill so I just went for the current exhibit. This was a wonderful way to do it and I'll try to do that more often.
,,,,,"Definitely a very good art museum with a lot of famous paintings like American Gothic and Nighthawks. Not the best Art museum out there, but one to stop by in Chicago."
,,,,,"Go during the week when it isn't so busy.  Amazing collections.   A ""must visit"" place for tourists and locals.  Check out the gardens along Michigan Ave.  "
,,,,,They should reopen the members lounge.  How can it still be closed when every other restaurant and bar in the city have reopened (except the many that are gone permanently due to the city's clownish handling of the pandemic)?
,,,,,Locals in Chicago underestimate the value of having a worldly museum like this in their backyard. So many great works that you can walk right up to. Visitors and locals alike should prioritize visits to AIC. Look for coupons or discounts if youre on a budget
,,,,,"we are canceling our membership , no docents forget about it.  Nice job AIC board!"
,,,,,Absolutely a world class museum with some of the most recognizable works of art in modern history. Don't miss the miniatures gallery and the Monet exhibit. You can also use the app to have the guiding voices which maybe helpful for the first time visitors.
,,,,,The modern wing is also worth checking out. And if you have an extra hour go check out the Chagall windows downstairs with the miniature rooms which are just splendid.
,,,,,As I said this has to be one of the best art museums in the country. I was in there for three or four hours and I still didn't have time to see it all. I would certainly recommend this museum to anyone visiting Chicago. I took the train into downtown last weekend but noticed traffic was light so I think maybe during the pandemic driving is more manageable than usual
,,,,,"Great museum with lots of amazing pieces of artwork, including iconic pieces like: The one where they're sitting in a Waffle House after a long night of drinking (Hopper's Nighthawks); The one where people go to the beach wearing full-length formalwear for some reason (Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte); The zombie jammin' out to Zeppelin (Picasso's The Old Guitarist); The selfie from a dude with one ear using an old Nokia flip phone so that the photo is pixelated (van Gogh's Self-Portrait), and the old dude with a pitchfork who is gonna warn you not to try to raise your pet from the dead because ""sometimes dead is better"" standing next to his apparently once-dead wife (Wood's American Gothic). There's a modern wing as well, but I personally would recommend spending most of your time looking at the things that aren't in that area...well, except maybe to see the Abraham Lincoln sculptures because those were pretty cool. Just don't ride on the giant kitty cats outside the museum. That apparently is frowned upon in this establishment."
,,,,,Since it reopened after long closure because of Covid 19 and before full reopening they offer free ticket for the  limited period only to Illinois residents --We booked online and visited there.
,,,,,It was first time since the museum renovated the building.
,,,,,"We enjoyed lots of drawings, pictures,and the building itself."
,,,,,It is nice we again enjoy Chicago's signature museum again!
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,Art Institute is my favorite place to go. I just walk and enjoy art. I enjoy peace. 
,,,,,I love how campus looks. 
,,,,,I like to spend some time in gift shop because they are very creative and you can see and buy cute stuff. 
,,,,,Since I moved to US I keep my membership in Art Institute like a sacred. 
,,,,,I like to have some tea in members area while I enjoy my book. 
,,,,,Durin the nice weather there is a restaurant on the roof whit amazing view. 
,,,,,I feel very honored to visit all exhibitions that Art offers. 
,,,,,Love to take my time and peacefuly enjoy in it.
,,,,,The Art Institute was one of few remaining reasons for visiting downtown. I will never step foot in that building again! Their decision to fire all of their mostly white female volunteers is sickening. Can you imagine the experience going forward with an uninterested staff? Will this staff have the same passion? Will they have the same knowledge of art? I would suggest anyone considering making a donation to the Art Institute look elsewhere.
,,,,,"You have fascinating artifacts, history, beauty and thoughtful exhibitions. You have brought so much joy to my life that I nick named you ""my favorite playground"" because when I visit you, I get to play, wonder, and live in other worlds created by art and your curators.  As a major cultural institution renounced among the best of the best, you do carry an incredible collection and support other artists and communities with such care and dedication which makes you even more darling to my eyes.   I have been a member on and off since I was a young kid.  I never want to miss any of your exhibits and revisit your permanent spaces because each time I do - its like the first time!  I never know what emotions your walls will evoke."
,,,,,"I don't know how it's possible I haven't reviewed the Art Institute yet.  I was introduced to AIC when I studied at SAIC for post-bac work (students get a free memebership) and I went there quite a lot.  This was when there was no modern wing, so yes, years ago.  Since then I have been a paying member, on and off, three or so times.  That thing pays for itself!  "
,,,,,"I've lived in New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, and travelled extensively in the States and Europe visiting museums.  While NYC definitely has some great museums and Philly's PMA and NYC's MoMa/PS1 are up there among my favorite museums, AIC definitely comes in first.  The Hermitage experience was ruined for me due to the overabundance of rude tourists, and I have not been to the Louvre yet, but I've otherwise been to a lot of museums in Europe.  Albertina in Vienna is a close second.  "
,,,,,"Tourists do flock to this place, but not in the overwhelming numbers that you'll see at The Met, Hermitage, Louvre, et al.  Summers get busy and the featured works of Hopper, Wood, Seurat, Picasso will have crowds around them, but there is so much to see at AIC.  Having a membership provides the opportunity to visit weekly if I choose; each time visiting a different section of the museum.  Try and visit during non-tourist seasons, or at least arrive early."
,,,,,"They have all kinds of art here as well.  You can easily get lost in here an entire day if you're the art lover.. there's something for everyone.  The temporary exhibits change up often, so you can always go back to see something new.  I'm so happy to have a museum like this in my city by the lake."
,,,,,Spent hours exploring the Art Institute of Chicago. 
,,,,,"I was most looking forward to seeing the Monet, Renoir and Degas Collections, they are my favorite Impressionists, Monet especially. We were surprised at how many famous paintings were all housed under the same incredible roof. There were quite a few Picasso pieces, Vincent van Gogh Gauguin, Mary Cassatt, Cézanne, Grant Wood, Georgia O' Keefe and many, many, more. "
,,,,,"Some of the Modern and Contemporary Art and the American Art wings were a bit hard to find as some of the floors are not connected and a bit confusing. My husband was most excited to see Picasso's The Old Guitarist and Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, so glad we were able to find them as it was our last stop before leaving. "
,,,,,"Was bummed to have missed Hokusai's Great Wave and I regret not visiting the gift shop on the first floor, but after spending hours in the museum I didn't want to go back down to the first floor and missed it. Oh well, next time. "
,,,,,"If you're visiting Chicago for the first time as we did, the Art Institute is a must see. You will not be disappointed!"
,,,,,lol I love how the cover photo is of white on white lol very SAIC
,,,,,"I actually learned how to open and flip through books properly in the library here. Love the openness of the Modern Wing, the stuff in it ranges from contemporary to experimental. Some are super cool, and the collection do change often. The gift shop also has some gems (books or play things) you can't find online. "
,,,,,"There's also free entrance after 5 on I believe Thursdays? I could be wrong, go look at their schedule, I don't work there"
,,,,,"For a twist, this review is for their cafe.  They have a great selection and everything looked delicious.  Had roasted chicken, asparagus, and sweet potato.  The chicken was moist, the roasted asparagus was cooked the prefect amount,  and the roasted sweet potato was soft and sweet."
,,,,,"Suggest eating ""in"" and not leaving the building to get lunch at a restaurant.  Enjoy great food ...and the additional time you will now have to see the exhibits."
,,,,,First class art museum with spectacular impressionist collection and a new modern wing. Also has Chigall stained flass windows and many other period wings. This collection and its periodic exhibits are world class.
,,,,,"Being a child of the 80's this place has a special place in my heart... it was featured in that timeless John Hughes film of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" the Museum scene of Cameron, Sloan and Ferris ditch day, while ""Please, Please, Please let me get what I want"" instrumental of the Smith's tune plays beautifully in the background. "
,,,,,"I made a mad dash to Chicago during my trip to Madison, Wisconsin. Headed over to the Bean and noticed that the Institute was having the Manet Exhibit... Impressionism is my favorite artwork so I ran eagerly up the steps only to find that they were closing in 30 minutes and I wouldn't be able to do see the display. Please note you must buy tickets in advance and if you show up with 30 minutes to spare they will not allow you to begin. The structure was going through renovations but it was still breathtaking to behold and the gardens around it were complimentary to the city and the Lake it sits upon. "
,,,,,So there I was... with tears in my eyes kicking myself that I had not planned this better. I decided to buy myself a consolation gift. Ha! the gift shop has everything you might want to find for someone that needs a unique item. In fact I prefer these as souvenirs then the staple ones you can find anyplace. 
,,,,,"Parking was on Michigan Avenue below ground you can't miss it and it was about $22.00 you can park there and make your way up to see the Institute, Lake and Millennium Park."
,,,,,Respectfully Reviewed
,,,,,"Wide selection of artists, genres and mediums all in the city of Chicago. Visit the third floor to find modern art or the second for contemporary. One trip to the art institute is never enough... maybe even two. You may be able to see it all, but to really SEE it is a different story."
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"GREAT art museum in Chicago-- a must go for any local or tourist. The collections are endless! I have been many times, but I always see something new every time. The museum guides are helpful for getting you to the ""must see"" works of art. The outdoor garden is an especially lovely place to sit and enjoy when the weather is nice!"
,,,,,A beautiful icon sits on Chicago's Michigan Avenue welcoming visitors local to international. 
,,,,,The famous lions sit like super models guarding the front entrance. They are almost as famous as the museum itself. 
,,,,,Staff was very helpful. When we checked in the woman was very friendly and welcoming. Security staff throughout were very helpful with directions. 
,,,,,The members cafe is smaller than I expected so it was a bit crowded. It reminded me of the newly renovated United Clubs at major airports. There is complimentary coffee and water. But you can purchase beverages as well. My friend had a nice rose. The bartenders were very sweet and checked on us often. 
,,,,,We were so excited to see the Rembrandt collection. There are so many floors and rooms to explore. We took our time and enjoyed famous pieces as well as items from the local Chicago history. 
,,,,,I was pleasantly surprised that our visit on a Saturday afternoon during Spring Break felt comfortable and not rushed. Everything is set up so visitors can spread out comfortably.
,,,,,Visited on 08/23/21 after 4 PM. There was an employee on the first floor that was ridiculously rude to my 10 year old cousin.
,,,,,"She got too close to a sculpture, and he approached her by dramatically cracking his neck, putting BOTH FISTS up to his neck, and telling her ""THIS ART COSTS MORE THAN YOUR SOUL"""
,,,,,"This is not an acceptable thing for a grown man to say to a little girl. He seriously needs to work on his social skills, and absolutely not be PHYSICALLY aggressive towards little girls. His purpose was to physically intimidate her with his aggressive body language."
,,,,,"Very rude, disrespectful, awkward, and totally weird experience. No employee of such a fine institution should raise his fists and say outrageous things to children."
,,,,,I hope this is addressed with his supervisor. Not a good look at all.
,,,,,"I am a fan of art, REAL art. This museum is probably one of my favorites... up there with Le Louvre and Museo El Prado! "
,,,,,"I am a huge fan of Impressionist art! This place has a beautiful permanent collection which includes Renoir, Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and many more. There is also a nice amount of Greek and a Roman sculptures and that is really impressive. "
,,,,,"Modern art is not necessarily, but my favorite but along with a gorgeous collection Georgia O'Keefe, Picasso's ""El Guitarrista"" is there. For people who love Modern and Contemporary Art, there is a huge amount of artwork from those styles. Just not my cup of tea. "
,,,,,I also enjoyed the large section of Architecture and Design.
,,,,,"It was a bit disappointing to find some of the exhibit areas closed and also just a tip: if you are going here to see the Obamas exhibit, my suggestion would be to go to that section and get checked in first. On a Monday (not holiday) when we went we were #294 in line with and estimated wait time of 86 minutes. Had I known that, I would have joined the virtual line when we first got there. As is, we were not able to see the exhibit due to our flight time out of Chicago."
,,,,,"The Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Modern Museum of Art, and now there's the Art Institute of Chicago. These are just some of the wonderful art museums I've been to and I have to say I am surprised to say that this museum in Chicago can compete with some of the world's best known."
,,,,,"Impressionism lives on in this gem. So much of it. Monet, my favorite painter of all time, has an entire section to his work. This made me quite deliriously happy, especially considering that some of his work I was able to recognize in terms of location. It's amazing how traveling and art can expand your perspective, but I digress."
,,,,,"Except not really. There was a security guard named Barbara by Seurat's famous painting and she kept going on about taking photos. Have to say she had a point, as through the lens, you got more and more of the dots that perhaps we see but we don't see fully. She has been the most entertaining person I've ever met at one of these museums and she definitely made the experience all the more enjoyable."
,,,,,"In terms of art, you can spend your entire day at the museum and still not see everything. I think somewhere on the walls, it said that becoming a member easily is worth it with two visits alone and I have to say I agree. The museum is massive, and with the exception of the first floor, nothing connects. You will get lost in here. Guaranteed. If not lost because of the floor plan, you will get lost in the paintings as you wander on through."
,,,,,"I wish I had been in Chicago longer, but it was a short trip. Get the Citipass if you're a tourist and want to hit all the hot spots. You can get one at the museum. If you don't want to hit all the spots, know admission is usually $25 per person. Also, if you have a coat, leaving it in the coat rack is $1."
,,,,,As far as things you must see:
,,,,,-American Gothic by Grant Wood;
,,,,,-A Sunday on La Grande Jatte by George Seurat (this is likely their most famous painting; I even bought an umbrella in this design from the museum store);
,,,,,-The Bedroom by Vincent Van Gogh;
,,,,,"-Water Lilies by Claude Monet (because hello, it's Monet, and he is known for this and you will see beautiful paintings on his home in Giverny);"
,,,,,-The Old Guitarist by Pablo Picasso;
,,,,,"-And in general, anything by Andy Warhol, Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne, and any of the other great artists I'm forgetting!"
,,,,,"This. Was. Such. A. Joy. I can't even articulate the amount of amazement I was in going through all the galleries in this enormous museum. To give some insight, I've taken quite a few art history courses during my college years and it was indescribable to see the artwork that I've studied for a decade...right in front of my eyes. There was some work that I was anticipating to see such as the classic Sunday Afternoon by Seurat, but some that I had no idea were here at the Art Institute like the American Gothic and ""This is Not a Pipe"" by Magritte. "
,,,,,In the attached photos you will find many of my favorites that were either beautiful or I had studied their history as a student. The Art Institute of Chicago is a definite must if you're interested in art; it's not like any museum I've been to and it most definitely requires at least a half day to just go through all the paintings and other art work. You'll find a myriad of categories ranging from time periods centuries ago. 
,,,,,There are indeed different fees for the museum but we decided to use our CityPASS. See your options and prioritize which works well for you. If goes without saying that headphones are offered to follow along for tours and there are lockers for you to keep your belongings aside when you are walking through the arena. Everything was very organized. We were there on a rainy afternoon on a weekday and it was packed! I can understand why. I'd also recommend putting on comfortable shoes as you'll be walking a lot.
,,,,,"What's to decide?  You should not only go but become a member and load the card on your phone. It allows you to skip the ticket line and see the special exhibits early and hang out in the members lounge by the courtyard.  You can show your visiting friends the best time easily. The special exhibits are the best.  Chicago and Monet and the Van Gogh bedrooms (yes, there were three!) were stupendous. More to come I'm sure."
,,,,,"I loved the museum, so happy they brought the Bisa Butler exhibit there and the Obama portraits  was amazing !!!"
,,,,,Largest collection of Impressionist art outside Paris. I've never had the time to see everything at the Art Institute of Chicago. 
,,,,,"I highly recommend visiting the Art Institute as often as you can, choosing a different set of galleries for each visit."
,,,,,"The store is a terrific source for gifts - for yourself, or someone else!"
,,,,,The Art Institute is one of the jewels in Chicago's crown.
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"Excellent art gallery! I came here for the Monet exhibit and was surprised to find that it was a one hour wait (I had to sign up via text), but it was well worth it! I was able to enjoy about half of the museum during that wait. Very extensive collections here. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,Going during COVID was definitely a different world. They did an awesome job!! There were arrows to direct flow as well as having staff all over to answer any questions about the exhibit and make sure people were following COVID protocol. 
,,,,,"As always, the exhibits were amazing and, compared to other museums in the city, I feel there were very few exhibits that were closed. "
,,,,,"Only other note I have is that the Monet has a virtual line to enter. I was trying to save it until the end and didn't get to see it as it was a 60-90 minute wait. Would have been nice to have signs warning one of this (I don't recall any, but I also could have missed them), but it is something to be prepared for!!"
,,,,,Got tickets to go and loved being among the great art. A must go for anyone! I live in Chicago and try to go at least once a year. You can get lost so get the app before you go. Bring your earbuds to listen to the talks about certain art. So worth it. 
,,,,,The dining was closed due to restrictions so bring your own water bottle. No food allowed. 
,,,,,Make sure to check in to the special exhibit when you first get there! We forgot and it was over an hour and half wait. We had already been there two hours.
,,,,,A magnificent art museum located in the heart of Chicago.
,,,,,"The Art Institute of Chicago is located in the Loop of Chicago. It's a short walk away from other iconic landmarks in the city, most notably Cloud Gate (the 'Bean'). You cannot miss it."
,,,,,The Art Institute of Chicago holds treasures and cultural artifacts from around the world. It is impossible to thoroughly go through every exhibit in a single day. The place is massive.
,,,,,"Luckily, tickets are cheap enough that people can come many times. There are also many discounts and free-museum days that visitors can take advantage of. Make sure to do your research before you go."
,,,,,"By no means, don't try to cover everything in one day. You'll exhaust yourself if you do that. Focus on what you want to see, spend time exploring from exhibit to exhibit, find something that resonates with you, and enjoy yourself."
,,,,,"I would recommend coming on weekdays since the crowd is much, much smaller during those days."
,,,,,5/5. Must-see in Chicago. Worth every penny.
,,,,,"If you don't find something to love in this  museum, then you must really hate art!  My husband and I had a great  time, searching for the top 10 must-see, and then getting lost seeing  other fun pieces. We went to the Monet ""Haystacks"" and that was  excellent. I am a person who must read every ""blurb"" and they did not  disappoint. Whoever writes those, did an excellent job describing what  we should be looking for and thinking about. I was very happy with all Covid protections, and the museum was exceedingly clean and family-friendly. I can't wait to go back and see the modern art wing, as we did  not have time for that on this visit."
,,,,,One of the top museums in the world. So beautiful and soothing to walk around in
,,,,,Being that I am from Chicago and alumni of Fine at Arts at Columbia College a few blocks aware from the Art Institute I have spent countless hour in this iconic museums. It is truely world class and consists of sprawling galleries. 
,,,,,It's a little odd writing a review about a museum of this caliber since there is nothing else to say other than it defines splendid. Looking for inspiration or taking in special installation of a world class artist? You will not be let down by any visit as the curators build collections which are mind blowing here.
,,,,,"This visit consisted of viewing the Andy Warhol - FROM A TO B AND BACK AGAIN exhibit. It was truly amazing to me to stand in front of his works ranging from self portraits, celebrities to his later works. This is a must see exhibit and would highly recommend a visit to understand the complex Warhol life and take in his works."
,,,,,Now for some tips:
,,,,,Membership : highly recommend becoming a member. The benefits are worth it even if you visit once or many times in a year.
,,,,,app- get the Art Institute App for interactive maps and guides audio tours. So educational and helpful.
,,,,,"Take it slow- take  it in- get close - back off- squint your eyes,  appreciate each brush stroke- checkin with yourself about what each piece make you feel."
,,,,,I spent the entire day here with my greek g/f Terri Lynn who changed my life. First museum of art i had ever been to and it was like a dream. Great memories! I can't wait to return!
,,,,,"Beautiful museum of art that should be on your to see list if visiting Chicago.    You may remember it from scenes in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  From ancient artwork to modern day artists, you get an up close and personal look.  Unfortunately ""Everything woke turns to sh!@.""  Please take into consideration that the museum is using skin color and assumptions to run the place."
,,,,,"The Art Institute of Chicago is a must visit for anyone visiting the city and locals who haven't been there in awhile. It's huge! And there is something interesting for everyone's taste in Art, from famous classical painters to old ancient sculptures to ultra modern art. There's even a small diorama exhibit in the basement that is incredible."
,,,,,You could easily spend an entire day walking the halls and still not see everything! They also regularly have rotating exhibits that are always worth checking out.
,,,,,111 S Michigan Ave
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,one of the country's great art museums. definitely worth a visit anytime you have the chance. hopeful the city's residents realize what a gem they have here.
,,,,,"Highly, highly recommend! They do a great job laying out the museum. It's a pretty big museum so plan to stay for 3 hours or more if you want to make your way through all the sections without rushing. I always spend whole day here, there are so much to see and learn. It's amazing to come especially in snow or raining days! Great world class art collections. Impressive collection of arts from all over the world, including artworks from Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet, etc. This is a fabulous museum and nice cafe to rest your feet. Also the staff there are very friendly and helpful. It's a must go if you visit in Chicago or even locals. Due to Covid the operation is difference even there is often a line but it goes through very quickly."
,,,,,"Absolute all start of an art museum. I always knew it was great but it took me some traveling overseas and browsing of other world class museums in Europe to realize how amazing the Art Institute is. I'd be thousands of miles away from home looking at priceless works of art and it would feel like I never actually left Chicago, which was a pretty cool feeling."
,,,,,Checking out the Picasso's Room special event here a few years ago was really amazing and it was great to be able to see that in person and I thank Art Institute for offering that option when it had it.
,,,,,I'm not sure how they're handling things now with the pandemic but hopefully this place will be able to re host guests and art lovers for a long long time.
,,,,,"It's the bloody Art Institute of Chicago, people! What do you think! It's amazing. C'mon! Anyone who doesn't like this place is a whiner of Biblical proportions. If a whole room of Van Goughs, Monets and Picassos isn't good enough for you then check out the miles of renaissance masterpieces. What? painting isn't your thing? Then check out all the pristine Greek vases and sculpture. Still not impressed? then blame the American education system for not teaching you how to appreciate the aesthetic of art. I love it."
,,,,,"So, spoiler alert, I got my degree in art from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. That meant I went waltzing through the museum nearly every day. I've seen their best, studied it and seen the hidden works the public hasn't. Plus, I've been to hundreds of museums around the world. To qualify it as one of the best in the nation is easy. It has so many famous works (made famous by the board game Masterpiece). Plus, it rivals the museums on NYC and The Smithsonian. Chicago is an excellent, world-class city. The museum is so worth a visit. Or, maybe 1000. Plan to spend at least 5 hours there. The fish across the street will wait."
,,,,,"One of Chicago's most well known and beloved museums. You could come here for one hour or spend the entire day and still not see it all. It is truly massive. They hold popular works of art by renowned artist such as Vincent Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Georgia Okeefe, Warhol, Georges Seurat, Frank Lloyd and so many more. You can be Ferris Bueller for the day and examine the famous pieces featured in that film. "
,,,,,We loved the way this museum was set up. All the staff were beyond knowledgeable and helpful. We had a very short time frame and their brochure was very helpful as it had a guide to their top pieces. We were able to see a lot of them within a hour but I wish I had so much more time to just appreciate it all. It was still amazing being able to see so many iconic pieces. I would highly suggest going even if just for a small visit because seeing works of art in person is very special and unlike a lot of experiences. I also highly suggest getting the city pass because you save a lot of money and it's one of many incredible stops.
,,,,,"Loved the museum. It obviously has an impressive, diverse collection, but it felt like the perfect size to spend a day there without feeling either underwhelmed or overwhelmed. We went to a special Claude Monet exhibit and it was well worth it."
,,,,,Wow. This place is huge! It's like the TARDIS. It didn't look that big from the outside.
,,,,,"We went to see the touring Rembrandt exhibit but before getting to that room, we had to go through the Impressionism rooms...rooms, plural. IMHO the number of masterpieces, in those rooms alone, is worth the price of admission. "
,,,,,The museum is not just full of paintings but there is a huge amount of sculptures and statues amongst other art works and artifacts. Whew.
,,,,,Need to go back. I know I missed a lot.
,,,,,I highly recommend.
,,,,,"If you're visiting Chicago and you like art, this place is a can't-miss. One of the largest art museums in the world, the Art Institute has everything. I've been there a dozen times and on my last visit, I discovered a whole exhibit I didn't know was there."
,,,,,The museum can get crowded on the weekends. Tip: enter through the Modern Wing on Monroe (starting from the main entrance walk to your left and around the corner). That entrance is usually less crowded.
,,,,,Wow! This is a great museum to visit! I had no idea how many famous pieces were housed here and at $25 GA it was absolutely worth it. They had such a variety of art from different times and various styles.  This place is deceptively spacious! You could easily spend all day. I was lucky enough to visit while the Obama Portraits were being displayed while they're on tour across the U.S.
,,,,,Definitely check this place out if you visit Chicago!
,,,,,"This is the largest art museum in Chicago and is conveniently located right in the downtown, right near the Bean. We came on a Sunday afternoon and there was a medium sized ticket line, but it was less than a 10 minute wait to get in. This place reminded me a lot of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, except slightly smaller."
,,,,,"Like the Met, they have art from all over the world throughout history. The American and European sections appeared to be the largest, with a lot of paintings. However, there are still sections dedicated to Asian art, Native American, African, ancient Egypt, ancient Greek and more. We spotted a few famous pieces too, like ""American Gothic"" and ""Nighthawks"". This place is definitely a must see for art lovers in Chicago."

,,,,,"To just let volunteers go for over decades that have took time hard work and energy, I won't ever go back and spend my money there just over the color of your skin! Stupid and ridiculous! I have stopped all donations! Plenty of other places in Chicago I can spend my money"
,,,,,I think my school took me there on a field trip once... I would love to go back shortly and see what's changed.  
,,,,,Thank you for providing such a Wonderful place; nonetheless.
,,,,,Beautiful set up and much bigger than I expected. Make sure to have at least two hours to explore the whole museum. Definitely worth it since they have so many types of art work
,,,,,"We are so lucky to have an absolutely world-class museum in Chicago. With an already fantasic permanent collection (my favorite is the impressionist pieces), the museum complements this by consistently bringing in beautiful and thought-provoking exhibits regularly. You can visit the AIC repeatedly and never have an identical experience. The first time I went, I spent 6 hours there. While I don't have such lengthy visits anymore, I usually do find myself close to tears. The only thing better than the art is to see people of all walks of life thoroughly enjoying the pieces that some of the greatest minds of all time have generously given us to treasure. Life moves slower and is simpler at the AIC. It's nice to step away from the hubbub of the big city and escape into a world of art now and then. Nothing else matters when you're inside the AIC. It's a portal to another world where the only thing that matters is treasuring the the present and enjoying each moment when you're face-to-face with a Monet, a Manet, a Degas, or perhaps Caillebotte's masterpiece Paris Street, Rainy Day. Just writing this has made me want to go back to my happy place as soon as I can."
,,,,,"Absolute world-class collection of artwork. So lucky to have such a phenomenal gallery of art right here in Chicago. I've been a member for 7 years now, and I'm so happy. Great discounts in the gift shop and free admission for myself and a guest. Highly recommend becoming a member. Free admission to the special exhibits too. Check out the AIC ASAP. I recommend giving yourself about 4-6 hours if you're an art aficionado like me."
,,,,,Monet or Manet? This place has an impressive collection of both.
,,,,,"The Art Institute of Chicago is massive. You need more than a whole day to really see and appreciate everything here. This place has art from all corners of the world, pieces from the ancient era to the modern era, and not just paintings and sculptures but also photographs, ceramics, textiles, artifacts and so much more - spread out over four gigantic levels."
,,,,,"The wife and I visited two years ago (this review is way overdue) using a Chase Private Client pass to get free admission. Walking through this museum was awe-inspiring. There were 16th century European paintings like ""The Nativity"" on display unprotected. 5th century Byzantine stone mosaics hanging nonchalantly on the wall. And Roman marble statues from the 1st century just chillin' in the middle of the room. Georges Seurat's ""A Sunday Afternoon"" drew the most crowds, while the space in front of Marc Chagall's famous ""American Windows"" was not as crowded (granted, we saw the windows towards the end of the day)."
,,,,,"The museum is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but so many of their pieces are viewable for free on the virtual tour section of their website. What a great way of continuing to enjoy these treasures of history. Some of the pages on the website will give you even more information and background than what you'd get at the museum. And like with the museum, you'll really need more than a whole day."
,,,,,This is a review of the Art Institute online store.
,,,,,Kudos to the Store.  
,,,,,"I have had the best framed reproductions of art works here:  beautiful gilt frames, excellent quality archival paper prints."
,,,,,"The dimensions of the prints, it should be mentioned, are on the order of 12"" x 18"" and no larger.  Which is not as big a deal as one might imagine."
,,,,,"[Le seul bemol c'est qu'il y a une fois j'ai fait une commande pour le tableau de Fantin-Latour qui s'accroche au musee.  On m'a expedie, par contre, une reproduction d'un tableau d'une paysanne peint par Camille Pissaro.  Ca m'a coute beaucoup d'effort pour faire renvoyer celui-ci.  En fin de compte, je suis parvenu a faire envoyer le tableau souhaite chez moi]."
,,,,,"No,I don't see myself getting on a plane to go to Chicago just to go the Art Institute, despite the many treasures contained within its walls (including Seurat's ""Un dimanche apres-midi sur l'isle de la Grande Jatte"" or, in English, ""Sunday in the Park"" made famous by the Sondheim musical)."
,,,,,"It is because of the online museum store, however, that I am able to enjoy a decent reproduction, albeit photo-mechanical, of a marvelous painting by one of the most interesting, although not well known in the U.S., 19th century realist painters who was a contemporary of the Impressionists."
,,,,,"Compare to the museum stores of the Metropolitan, Philadelphia Museum of Art, National Gallery of Art (Washington) or European counterparts (Louvre, National Gallery (London), Courtland, Prado...)."
,,,,,"Membership is well worth it  Love bringing Plus Ones for free, the membership lounge downstairs as a great break in the day/visit, and the gift shop sketchbook paper is the BEST I've ever drawn with. Staff are also amazing and polite. The selection of art is immaculate. Love love love. Had to mention- Sketchbook paper is very very good! Acid free (so can take marker), can layer a regular pencil over/over for extreme darks.. I pick up a new one every time I go in. (And they're always on sale!)"
,,,,,"We have been members of the Art Institute for many years and have never been disappointed with all their is to see. Membership has allowed us to easily have short visits when under an hour is what we can have. Senju's Waterfall for Chicago is beautiful and we discovered some Japanese remainders from the Japanese Garden on the Wooded Island. Andre Kertesz: Postcards from Paris was delightful. The Barbara Kruger exhibit was a bit much for us, especially the pounding noise."
,,,,,"I always love going to the Art Institute. I had a memorable experience the first time I went, on my first trip to Chicago in spring 2001. Love some of the shows they come up with beyond the usual suspects and the biggies. This trip was specifically to see Bisa Butler, which is one of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen, regardless of the medium. Obviously, everyone else feels the same way, because I couldn't buy the book for her show, as it's in its fourth printing! I've gotten many books through the years of the thoughtful exhibits seen here so that I can revisit them later. This is a classic place, that continues bringing exciting and fun exhibits to Chicago. Always worth a visit!"
,,,,,"Fantastic to visit even if you're not an art buff. I have visited twice and I mostly enjoy the modern and contemporary sections, as well as the American artists. There are so many beautiful and famous works here. I was disappointed to see Nighthawks was out on loan on my first visit, so I was thrilled to see it this time! My husband is a Rothko lover, and they have five of his pieces!"
,,,,,"The visiting exhibits are always worth a look. I have seen a special exhibit on Impressionists and the current Monet. I do wish museum staff would better control the flow of people in that exhibit. They are managing it with a virtual line; you receive a text when it is your turn. But it was still very crowded and difficult to move around. While we enjoyed Monet, we aren't diehard fans, so we scooted through to spend our time in the other galleries. I think staff should let in smaller groups of people in 10-minute waves instead of a constant stream of people piling in on top of one another. Also, there was a couple in line behind us when we showed up for our time. They seemed distressed because they didn't have tickets and it was sold out online. While I was glad to see they got to view the exhibit (and were right behind us moving through the rooms), obviously, the staff let them in without a ticket. If they're doing that frequently, that bottlenecks the exhibit even more."
,,,,,"Bring your headphones for the audio tour! I remember them giving us a listening device on my previous visit, but now the audio tour is only available via their app, and you need your own headphones. They're doing okay with COVID precautions. Masks are required, the cafe is shut down, and they remind you to social distance, but that is not possible in the special exhibit due to the amount of people in that space."

,,,,,If you live in Chicago and can count the number of times you visit the each week on two hands then you're missing out.  I can't wait to come back.
,,,,,"Check and see if your company allows for free admission with their corporate sponsorship agreement! I feel blessed that my organization allows myself and a guest free admission upon request as there are so many exhibits worth seeing and not enough time to take it all in in one trip. What I appreciated most was that even amongst some of the more recognizable pieces (Nighthawks, American Gothic etc.), crowds didn't nearly gather as much like I've seen in other art museums. The museum does a fantastic job in providing an experience for all ages but also maintaining and environment conscious of keeping everyone healthy."
,,,,,I didn't know I could love a museum as much as I love here! I spent 3 hours walk through each exhibit and still wasn't able to see everything. I was really looking forward to the quilt series but textiles section was closed. Just another reason to go back.
,,,,,"The Impressionist collection here is not to be missed! The Art Institute is a world class museum, so plan to wear comfortable shoes and put in a lot of steps!"
,,,,,"The best collection in Chicago with touring collections only seen in NYC and Los Angeles otherwise. Pre and during Covid, the Warhol exhibit showed here before anyplace. If you're an Illinois resident, check their website, as there is free admission several days each month with your state ID. Also, most museums in Chicago participate in the program that allows anyone on SNAP/EBT free admission every day. That doesn't include special exhibits, but it's a very good deal a lot of folks don't know about. A must see if you appreciate fine art and you find yourself in Chicago. Easy location via transit. I'm unsure about parking, but everything is handicapped accessable. Go!"
,,,,,"Beautiful place, i had a city pass option checked out this place first. The place is huge, they are strict with masks, covid protocol. I spent about 4 1/2 hrs here. Take your time. I love the Impressionist and modern art sections.  5 stars."
,,,,,What a huge and spectacular place. I could not believe how massive it is. From the kind lady who provided us with free tickets due to our military veteran status to the people monitoring the museum.  I highly recommend going. Keep in mind it may take a whole day to see everything.
,,,,,"The Art Institute has a wonderful collection of paintings and sculptures, and has a modern wing east of the main building. The socials are well-attended and vibrant (although not scheduled recently) and the restaurant in the roof is excellent."
,,,,,Extremely racist organization. They do not like ambitious smart white skinned people. They don't realize that it is also who supports them financially.
,,,,,That's the end of that museum if Robert Levy doesn't backtrack.
,,,,,100% must see. It was glorious in every way. Highly recommend a full 6 hours or more as this place is massive. Staff is friendly and will answer any questions you have!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"The Art Institute of Chicago is a must-see if you live or are traveling to Chicago. My friends and I bought the city pass and had access to this museum. I would highly recommend getting the city pass, as it has multiple great attractions throughout the city. Keep in mind, if you are wearing a backpack, it is required to wear it in front. "
,,,,,"The cafe was closed during our visit, so I would recommend bringing your own bottle of water. "
,,,,,This was in august 2021. 
,,,,,The Museum is huge!!! I would recommend setting aside 2-3 hours at the minimum to have a pleasant experience. The museum is split up into multiple sections with stairs and elevators throughout. 
,,,,,I would recommend getting a map at the front so you don't get lost! 
,,,,,"All in all, this is one of the best museums I've ever been to and would highly recommend you add it to your checklist when you come to Chicago!"
,,,,,"This place was HUGE! I was very impressed with the layout of the building because there was plenty of space to accommodate the large amount of people visiting the museum (without feeling too crowded). This weekend happened to be ""Bank of America"" weekend so anyone who had a card with them, got in for free. This saved us $94 total for our group! There is a wide variety of art available for viewing so if you go with a group, there's probably something for everyone. The only thing I wish they did different was set it up so you were kind of guided through the museum on a path (like an IKEA) so you made sure you saw everything the museum had to offer instead of free roaming, making it more difficult to see every single exhibit/showroom. Plan on spending an hour or two here."
,,,,,I love this museum.  It has been a few years since I've been to Chicago and the first thing I always want to visit is the Art Institute.  I've discovered this place years ago and heard about the large collection they have of impressionist art.  This time around I accidentally discovered a miniature collection at the basement.  It was pretty amazing and what a discovery.  I wish I had more time to explore the newly expanded museum.  They now have an ultra modern addition in the back.  Love the Georgia O'Keefe painting in the back stairwell.  This place never disappoints.  Will be back again soon.
,,,,,"Way too much to see in one day , but my crew gave it our best shot! So glad we snagged tickets to the Monet and Chicago exhibit, it was our favorite part of the entire museum. Next time I need to find someone to be my tour guide because this place is MASSIVE and I don't want to miss anything. What a treat to be able to spend the weekend exploring a world class museum. Looking forward to the Obama portrait and Tiffany glass exhibits"
,,,,,"I went to the museum to see the special Monet exhibit. You must book ahead of time and on this day, they were sold out. Members get into the museum an hour early everyday. This is a wonderful perk and one of many benefits of membership."
,,,,,The exhibit is beautifully curated. You might want to bring ear bud because there is an audio you can access through your phone. 
,,,,,The flow of the work allows you to get a feel for his evolutionary process. The written explanations were great taking you into Monet's Life and challenges as well as his reflection on his work.  There were interesting videos that looked at various works using modern X-ray systems to look below the painting surface. You get to see what was painted and then changed in the final painting. The collection is large with works borrowed from Chicago collectors and works from the museum collection. You are allowed to take pictures but no videos.
,,,,,World class museum! Love the different house exhibits as well as the special showings they have. 
,,,,,Really recommend being a member if you live in the city of Chicago.
,,,,,This place is run by a bunch of racists who got rid of their very knowledgable volunteer docents
,,,,,"Thought sure I had reviewed this in the past, but if not here goes. This is one of the jewels in downtown Chicago."
,,,,,I love museums and love to visit them in many of the cities I visit. This was an absolutely fabulous experience. The layout if the exhibits were perfect and we were able to see many different genres of artwork from impressionism to American modern and many others...Many famous works were represented. The miniature rooms in the lower level were interesting as well!
,,,,,Kind of an awesome experience.   Rotating exhibits.  Great to spend a couple hours at.

,,,,,"Our family donates every year, management just asked us to cease all donations and tell our friend to stop giving money. Something about the color of our skin. Very weird, but anyway, we will listen and stop donating."
,,,,,Also you can take anything you want from their walls as long as it's under $1000. The city won't prosecute you. It's a great deal!!
,,,,,"Read their ""identity"" page of their website. They fired volunteers who have worked for the museum for years because of ""anti-racism."" So knowledgeable volunteers were kicked out to make way for novices. The payroll will be massive so you will be paying more to get in so they can continue their racial crusade. Do not come here if you aren't liberal."
,,,,,"Clean, climate controlled and curated, exactly what our humid summers and frigid winters call for. Happy to see more diverse perspectives represented this season. Went for Bias's quilts and the Obama portraits and were not disappointed. It was a weekday but still pretty crowded so plan to spend a couple hours and just enjoy wandering instead of thinking of it was ""waiting"". Appreciated the clean WCs and look forward to the cafes opening back up soon. Be sure to give your local zip code if you live in the city to get a Chicago resident discount."
,,,,,"Despite visiting throughout this years, the Art Institute never gets old. Its huge collection has something for everyone so that you can find your version of museum magic."
,,,,,"It is currently closed due to COVID, but you should definitely visit when you have the opportunity! Bring your kids, your adult friends, or just have a quiet day to yourself. This is a really special place."
,,,,,"Their Monet exhibit is an exciting current event, but there are many great classics here as well. Even without the exhibit, their Impressionist collection was significant."
,,,,,This review will be brief because everything about the Art Institute in Chicago is wonderful.  I could spend a whole week here and not get bored.  It is a complex of all kinds of art both new and old.  This is a real art museum with enough art to satisfy most art lovers.
,,,,,"Bisa Butler exhibit at the Art Institute is A-AMAZING!  I'm mean jaw dropping, exquisite tapestries on display. I snapped a few photos but really they do it a disservice. The level of detail in the facial expressions, the hands, the shoes, and clothing are astounding. The layers of fabric and interwoven history exude Excellence in artistry and pride of Black people.  And a Bonus for the Win - our hometown heroes the Obamas are on display. Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald are masterful capturing our forever first couple."
,,,,,I really enjoyed myself at the museum.  I went for a couple of hours.  I thought I was going to see the Obama paintings but got my weeks messed up.  One of the overseers of the rooms told me I would love the Bisa Butler exhibit and she wasn't lying.  I thoroughly enjoyed her exhibit and the overall museum.  I will be back it's very peaceful and thought provoking to be in there.
,,,,,"Great atmosphere, very clean, and while busy, still covid-friendly. It has something something for everyone to enjoy. We even stopped in the Monet exhibit, and that was incredible. We saw everything from his early sketches to his greatest works. We will be back!"
,,,,,"This place is truly world-class. Tips: join as a member and get in an hour early for an empty museum! I recommend breakfast down the street at Goddess and the Baker, then show up at 10 am for entry. So many incredible and famous pieces. Download the app and bring headphones for free audio tours!"
,,,,,"The Art Institute of Chicago ranks right up there with the great art museums of the world. They have a great variety of rotating exhibits, meaning the museum never gets stale. If you think you'll go multiple times in a year, I highly recommend getting a membership - it pays for itself within a couple visits."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60603"
,,,,,"I absolutely loved the art institute from start to finish. The building is huge in itself, so it would take multiple visits in order to be able to take in and see everything. Of course the most popular exhibits right now are the Obama Portraits and the Bisa Butler collection. I love the divided sections and the collections within them"
,,,,,Are massive. I had a grand time and it was worth every penny.
,,,,,"One of the things that was suggested as a must do in Chicago. Tickets were $20/person.  While I am not an art person, it definitely was a very nice art museum. A lot bigger than I thought, and very well put together. There are so many floors of tons of art everywhere. There's so much to see. We got to see the Obama portraits which was cool. They have you put yourself on a virtual line with a QR code and would text you when it's your turn to enter to see the Obama portraits since it's such a popular exhibit right now. There were a few Van Gogh artworks, as well as his self portrait which was kinda cool to see. "
,,,,,"Staff members mostly wore masks. There wasn't a ton of hand sanitizer available, which I would have liked especially after touching handles to doors and stuff.. Bathrooms were very clean."
,,,,,"Since early childhood I have loved it, but in such a strangely holistic and indiscriminate way that I think I love it as a place, more than for what's in it. "
,,,,,"It won my five-year-old heart with those shallow marble stairs, after I'd gotten tired of clambering up and down deep Victorian steps to the basement where we were renting and being told to stop whining about falling (a real risk, but not all parents care)."
,,,,,"It has an amazing Van Gogh Poet's Garden, which they keep moving and making it hard to find, and a gorgeous interior garden with a neoclassical fountain that is especially cool when you're a small child and everything looks huge, but nice even as an adult. Overlooking this is a gallery that includes a small, podgy, pugnacious satyr from ancient Greece. I sent a phone photo of it to an artist friend, who responded succinctly, ""what in tarnation""."
,,,,,"Chicago has some of the most incredible museums and the Art Institute is no different. This place is HUGE, it feels like there could be 10 museums in just this one big building. It's impossible to go through this entire institution in one day so I would keep that in mind when setting personal expectations. "
,,,,,Here are my favorite things at the Art Institute:
,,,,,"- I like how a lot of extremely famous paintings are just sitting there with other not-so-famous paintings. It almost makes the place like a huge scavenger hunt as you have to look at all the other paintings before you find the one you're looking for. These newly discovered paintings could then potentially become one of your favorites! Also, it's kind of interesting they don't particularly place these famous paintings on a special wall because there are so many of them all around. "
,,,,,"- I've studied so many paintings when I was really young so it was such a shocker to see them in person in this museum: paintings like The Old Guitarist by Picasso, American Gothic by Grant Wood, The Child's Bath by Mary Cassatt, and Two Sisters by Pierre-Auguste Renoir."
,,,,,"- I really liked the Chinese/Asian side of the museum, they have so many relics and statues that are all quite beautiful."
,,,,,"- A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte was beautiful because of how big it was but the funniest part was on the opposite side of the wall, there seems to be a small version of this with slightly different characters also by Seurat. It's kind of funny because the small version almost seems like his practice round before he drew the real thing."
,,,,,- The amount of Monet water lilies and haystacks the museum has is quite insane. I believe they have their own room.
,,,,,"Overall, I seriously cannot wait to come back. Hot tip, wear good shoes because you will be walking a lot and your feet will get tired. The museum will seriously convert you into wanting to be an art historian."
,,,,,This is THE ART MUSEUM of all art museums. The modest brown exterior does not give justice to how large and diverse the art is inside. 
,,,,,"Wear your most trendy outfit and comfortable shoes because you will be spending HOURS here. Whether it's your first time or your thousandth time visiting the Art Institute, there is always something new to see."
,,,,,"Look out for discounted tickets for college students, free days + times for Chicago residents, and more! Unfortunately the cafe inside was closed during our visit because of COVID, but everyone had their mask on and social distancing was enforced."
,,,,,"We took public transportation to get here and had no problem finding the museum. Street parking is pretty hectic since you are right next to Millenium Park and The Bean, so keep that in mind! "
,,,,,"That being said, there is truly something for everyone here. There are classic sculptures, world famous paintings, interactive exhibits, and more. I was pleasantly surprised by how many famous pieces there were. It felt like you were walking through a history textbook! "
,,,,,There are so many gems inside the gift store as well. Treat yourself to a shopping spree! 
,,,,,I can't wait to go back soon and see new exhibits. They switch them out every so often so definitely look on their website or social media for more updates. 
,,,,,"Your Instagram followers look forward to your breathtaking photos, trust me! ‍"
,,,,,What a great museum I mean it's well laid out and have the Obama photos was the icing on the cake definitely worth the trip!!
,,,,,"Went on a Saturday morning when it opened to see the Obama portraits. The line to get in, even though we had purchased tickets online, was at least two blocks long. We decided to wait a bit, and went back in 45 minutes and were able to walk in. There is a virtual line to see the Obama portraits and even though it estimated it would be 45 minutes,  we got in in 30 minutes.  It was organized and you were not rushed through. Of course,  everyone wanted pictures and selfies, but overall,  everyone was reasonable. The art Institute has all types of art to view from modern to impressionists. Be prepared for lots of walking,and,and  lots of stairs. The cafes were still closed due to Covid, so there are no food or drink options."
,,,,,Always one of our favorite places to go in Chicago. The rotating exhibitions are always amazing.
,,,,,I used to love this incredible space but their active choice to let go of docents specifically on the basis of their race and gender is egregious. White women are not welcome to volunteer here as they don't reflect what the institutes wants to
,,,,,portray. Check out the WSJ article. This is completely bigoted.
,,,,,"One of my favorite places in Chicago was of course the Art Institute-specifically the Monet exhibit! The miniature rooms were so fun to watch and made me imagine how I can tweak my home. The collection at the Impressionists exhibit was impressive, as well as the Korean Art exhibit which was very elegant. I wished the Koryeo & Chosun dynasty were more descriptive and extensive. There were beautiful pieces, but the course was not as extensive as the Chinese or Japanese art exhibits. Instead, I stayed in the Monet exhibit alone for 3 hours, and I could stay longer if I didn't get hungry!"

,,,,,What a fantastic museum. The best collection of impressionists I have ever seen.
,,,,,"I have appreciated everything I saw, enjoyed all the seating areas also."
,,,,,Would totally go back the next time I am in town.
,,,,,The Art Institute is my happy place.
,,,,,"Is there anything more to say? Okay, I'll go on."
,,,,,"First, the special exhibits are unparalleled. From the Obama Portraits to Bisa Butler to Barbara Kruger to the Hokusai/Hiroshige landscapes - they hit it out of the park every time."
,,,,,And that doesn't even touch on the mini exhibits they do throughout the institute. Go check out the Rothkos they have right now!
,,,,,"Even when there isn't a special exhibit, I'll go check out the impressionists, the miniature rooms (which are really special around Christmas time when they're additionally decorated), the Greek/Roman statues. Oh, it goes on and on. "
,,,,,"Be sure to download the app. If you see a number by a piece of art, you can listen to additional backgrounds and stories about that piece of art. "
,,,,,They also have a number of audio tours on the app - definitely worth your time!
,,,,,"Get your geek on for The Art Institute! Even if you don't know art well, I guarantee there is a room of cool stuff for you. "
,,,,,"When I first moved to Chicago, I visited every weekend and chose a different room/collection to visit. It was an awesome way to get to know the Institute and get exposure to artworks I don't know if I ever would have visited. "
,,,,,"Listing what they have here would be redundant to other reviews and exhaustive. Besides, everyone has their own favorite spots. Mine is the mind-blowing Impressionism section as well as Asian art. The large Andy Warhol Mao is a personal fave."
,,,,,"My 6yo son would tell you the armor collection is the best. (However, they significantly downsized and relocated it last yea so it's not a huge collection anymore. "
,,,,,"True story: took my 6yo last year. I insisted we check out at least one we collection for him. We walk up to a Jackson Pollack where a number of people are intently examining it. He exclaims (very loudly) ""This is NOT art"" and walks away. Couldn't agree more little dude :)"
,,,,,"Whether you live in Chicago or are just visiting, don't miss the incredible destination. Even if is to marvel at the stunning architecture of their modern wing addition, you're sure to find culture and inspiration here. "
,,,,,"Knights and armor!!!!! Amazing impressionism section, miniature rooms, asian art, contemporary (the large"
,,,,,"I knew I had to come visit this muesum during my trip to Chicago. This was quite the experience! Made sure to have enough time to thoroughly explore the Institute but honestly there's just so much to see. I wanted to take the time to read about & briefly discuss the pieces of art so I think for the future I would plan to focus on one floor/section per visit. With that being said, I liked that there was a ""short on time"" section in the guide. It listed all of the popular, ""must-see"" art that visitors should visit if they only have an hour to spare."
,,,,,"The inside is very crisp and clean. They require everyone to wear masks and all visitors were socially distanced for the most part. There were a few rooms that were very packed due to the popular pieces which can be expected. There are some exhibits where you are allowed take photos and others where you cannot, of course. It's always best to ask one of the security guards if you're unsure. "
,,,,,"Even with viewing this museum online, it is nothing compared to the experience in person. There was so much more I got to see that I wasn't expecting. From paintings to photography, sculptures to digital video, there's so much art to digest and appreciate. If you are looking to fill up your trip itinerary or looking for something to do on the weekend, you need to make plans to come here. I hope I can come by again soon!"
,,,,,Such a delight to visit here again and so much to enjoy.  Today's visit was spent mostly in the Modern Wing.  What a treasure we Chicagoans have here.
,,,,,"Yep, the Art Institute is still the #1 Thing to Do in Chicago per Trip Advisor.  And it's not surprising once you're reminded of what all is here.  However, I must say I haven't been here in so long that I can't even remember the last time.  It's a classic example of forgetting the treasures in your own backyard, but I made up a bit of lost time today.  I recently saw the non-member senior admission was only $16 and that sealed the deal for a visit.  For some reason I thought I recalled seeing (rightly or wrongly) an admission fee in the area of $35 and I thought that was kinda steep for an uncultured person, so I put a visit further down the list."
,,,,,"Anyway, any self-respecting Chicagoan would be remiss to not visit AIC at least once.  There's a lot to see and enjoy here.  The current premier exhibit is the Obama Portraits.  I liked and admired 'em both, but still thought this particular exhibit was overhyped for the content.  On a relatively quiet Monday visit, I still had a 45 minute wait with their QR scan e-queue, but it was no biggie as I could peruse plenty of other artwork while awaiting a text notification."
,,,,,"I could see where an interesting rotating exhibit would draw me and many others back.  I also have the luxury of coming here at a non-peak time, a big advantage I would say for enjoying the displays.  For today, I enjoyed just finding paintings I liked for whatever reason, admiring paintings of well-known greats Monet and van Gogh, and just taking in the vast and amazing diversity of artwork available in one place here.  I saw a lot but didn't see it all which I'm not sure is even possible in one visit.  I also enjoyed a little bit of people watching, ha.  Thumbs up, but that's not a very new message is it!"
,,,,,Have been going here all my life and it is always such a treat. It has one of if not the best impressionist art collection outside of Europe. The newer modern wing is beautiful and has so much natural light. 
,,,,,They do allow strollers but I found some of the evaluators to be out of service which meant carrying it up and down flights of stairs which was no fun. I also found it a little tricky to navigate the most recent time I went because we entered through the modern wing (as opposed to the entrance on Michigan ave). 
,,,,,You save about $7 if you are a Chicago resident. It's free to military families in the summer through the blue star program.
,,,,,Acclaimed art museum and a must-do for tourists and locals alike. Came here with a friend on Friday after lunch and bought tickets at the box office insider. The coat room is currently closed due to covid. You are allowed to carry backpacks and have water bottles; I love that there are water bottle refilling stations by the bathrooms so you can stay hydrated. The cafe was closed when we went (Aug 2021). Entrance is $25 and there are discounts for Chicago residents/students/members. Credit cards are accepted. 
,,,,,"The place is huge and I would suggest allowing at least two to three hours to explore all three levels. We were lucky to have caught the presidential portraits before they were gone. There are a number of famous pieces housed in the museum. There are both stairs and elevators for you to go around. Art aficionado or not, you'll have a fun time."
,,,,,"One of the world's best art museums, the Art Institute includes the largest collection of Monet outside of Paris. (In the 1880s, famous Chicago millionaires like Bertha Palmer (of the Palmer House Hilton Hotel) really got into Monet and bought a lot of it. The white marble building itself was built for the 1893 World's Fair and then converted to the art museum afterwards. "
,,,,,Fun fact: They engraved names of artists on the outside (look along the roofline when you go in) without even knowing what would be put inside!
,,,,,"I've been a member off and on for almost 15 years, so while the AI is a ""Must See"" for tourists, I'm a huge fan of residents having a regular pass. You love art a whole lot more when you can stop in regularly."
,,,,,"I have tons of tips for visits, but here's a few:"
,,,,,* Use the contemporary wing entrance instead of the traditional Michigan avenue entrance by the Lions. It's usually less crowded.
,,,,,"* Backpacks are sometimes allowed and sometimes not. It's really a crap shoot. On the website they will say, no, but it seems to depend on the entrance guard. If they do allow they will often require you to turn them around and wear them like a baby."
,,,,,* The app for your phone has free audio-tour entries on it. Art is a lot more interesting when you hear additional explanations
,,,,,"* Free daily tours are worth it. You often get curators or art instructors from the linked School of the Art Institute, and instead of being boring, they usually tell good stories and make the art that much more interesting. I know a lot of my stories about the art from making a point of going on these!"
,,,,,Experience Improvements
,,,,,"AI gets 5 stars just because of the magnitude of the institution and the amazing art. But, some complaints:"
,,,,,"* Some of the room guards can be unnecessarily grumpy. I realize they are bored, but still."
,,,,,* Would be way better if there were art ambassadors wandering around able to answer questions about the arts. Or hiring guards that are also volunteer docent level. (a few of them can! but only because they learn on their own I think).
,,,,,"* Restaurant experiences have largely been closed since COVID--too bad since most other eating establishments have been able to open safely. Even the Art Institute's outdoor seating was closed this summer, which is just a miss."
,,,,,"* Prior to COVID, the member lounge had really pedantic restrictions on not bringing coffee or food across the line of the lounge despite the fact that they were all adjacent and it was natural to do so. Hopefully in the next iteration they will think that thru and fix it."
,,,,,We originally went here to see Obama's portraits and ended up spending much more time than originally expected.
,,,,,There are tons of really great pieces here and you can simply get lost in the labyrinth of galleries. This is my first visit to the Art Institute but on my next trip back to Chicago I will be sure to go again and explore more!
,,,,,"Thought sure I had reviewed this in the past, but if not here goes. This is one of the jewels in downtown Chicago. For more than a century the Art Institute has brought a touch of class and beauty to the area. The grounds around the Institute are beautiful, but inside the building is where it really shines. "
,,,,,"The Art Institute has world class collections in a number of fields - Impressionism, Monets, etc., and a visit here really cannot take in everything there is. But we like it that way. Every time we visit we go off in a different direction - if we are not here to see a special exhibit - and always find something interesting and educational. Needless to say the Art Institute is a visual extravaganza.  "
,,,,,"Don't miss the newer modern wing, the old masters, the black & white photography, numerous sculptures, and remember they have a world class library also. While you can bring strollers, it is a bit unwieldy to schlep infants through the rooms. There is a lot of walking, so bring comfortable shoes. And walk up the grand staircase - they don't build stuff like this anymore. Highly recommended."
,,,,,"Beautiful collections, thoughtful and helpful staff, great shop. Eager for cafes and restaurant to reopen."

,,,,,"Love the small plates and sangria! Great spot to bring a group of friends or have a date night. I appreciate the variety of dishes they offer here, and it doesn't break the bank either."
,,,,,This place is great for celebrations and fun meals plus their sangria and paella are delicious and feed a whole group.
,,,,,"We tried a couple of times to book this place but since we were a lot of us, never got reservations. However one day, three of us tried our luck and walked in and to our surprise, we got a table."
,,,,,"The food was so good, drinks were good too. I loved my sangria. "
,,,,,"However, I have cut down one star here because the goat cheese tomato sauce was a let down. This is one of fav items when I go to tapas, but is wasn't good here. Other than that, I loved it all."
,,,,,"Great tapas place for a great price. Everything that is in red on their menu is delicious. The roasted chicken empanada just melted in my mouth- not to mention the mouth watering sauce it came with. Don't even get me started on their potatoes with spicy aioli. We got their sourdough bread and dipped it in everything- the garlic shrimp, the aioli, etc. honestly when I ate here I felt like an elevated version of my self- it was as if all my chakras aligned, taste buds bursting. The wagyu beef was also delicious."
,,,,,"Wow- yes, wow! We were lucky enough to stumble in for brunch and it was even better than we had hoped. We started with a breakfast combination that did not disappoint. The deviled egg, the yogurt bowl, the frittata were all good. The French toast and the waffle/chicken were outstanding! Two of us shared a pitcher of passion fruit sangria and enjoyed every drop. Both the macaroni and cheese and beef empanada were winners as well. There were many more things to try on the menu and I'm looking forward to a return visit."
,,,,,This is my first time trying out Spanish food. Pleasantly surprised by many tapas and passion fruit sangria.
,,,,,"You may not be a fan of salad . Doesn't matter, try this out. The item name is Brussels sprout salad."
,,,,,"Peri-peri Chicken thighs, deviled eggs , baked mushroom , garlic shrimp, chicken empanada, potatoes are all good."
,,,,,"Chicken satay , salmon are okay. "
,,,,,My pick:
,,,,,Chicken empanada
,,,,,Peri peri chicken thighs
,,,,,Brussels sprout salad.
,,,,,"Waitstaff was attentive and friendly, my table was bussed of extra plates quickly and by whichever staff member was nearby, and the food was very fast, cooked well, and tasted good. It's not a place I could afford every week, but I'm glad I went and will return again."
,,,,,My boyfriends family threw a party here and had all of us seated in a big round table which was nice to have. We were able to share all the tapas around and talk to each other face to face. We had some sangria and some wine as well. Both were great. We had tried almost everything and I don't remember anything I didn't like. We had paella as well which is something you have to try if you come to this place. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.
,,,,,"So good! Been here twice and I will definitely go back! All of the food is delicious, so you simply cant go wrong. We liked everything we got - especially the potatoes. I forgot to take a picture of the chicken empanada but it was so good. They also have a nice section with an open roof and large window (perfect for COVID)."
,,,,,"This place is so fun! We came here on vacation for breakfast tapas and it didn't not disappoint. It's tucked in a corner, so keep your eyes peeled! The paella is a must (creamy, runny yolk my egg on top) and the Cubano was delicious. It's such a fun restaurant with build your own Bloody Mary bar! I would recommend this place for tourists, but I know a lot of locals also indulge in this! "
,,,,,Would definitely come back again for more TAPAS!!!

,,,,,"Probably one of the best tapas places I've been to in chicago! The ambiance is perfect for both date night, or just a casual meal with friends/family. The staff were extremely welcoming and we were promptly seated. In regards to food, the portion sizes were bigger than I expected for tapas, which was a nice surprise! If you're feeling extra hungry, I would definitely recommend getting the paella as well. The flavor combinations for each dish were unique and complementary and I could tell a lot of effort was put into each one. My only negative would be that the service was extremely slow that evening. Not sure if they were understaffed that day, but our sever was balancing a table of 14 plus 3 other tables in addition to ours, so we ended up waiting a long time in between drink/food/dessert orders. Aside from the wait, the service was exceptional, and we even got a free dessert for the birthday boy! Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"
,,,,,"Came here with a big party, not expecting much at all being vegan and seeing that the menu shows maybe one or two basic vegan options. But was wonderfully surprised and had some incredibly tasty food."
,,,,,"My friend let them know ahead of time that I was vegan, and they made a totally separate vegan menu for me, including an amazing vegetable pallela, an incredible chickpea dish, and dessert. All of the dishes were on par with the non-vegan dishes, and some even tastier according to my friends. Overall very pleasantly surprised, really appreciate how much effort they put into not only making vegan options, but making them with as much concern for taste and quality as their other dishes. Now they just need to have a permanent vegan menu available! :)"
,,,,,Amazing food and atmosphere! My boyfriend and I came here after they finally opened back up for dine in and the service was great. The hibiscus and blood orange sangria was amazing.
,,,,,"This paella paradise has been hyped up by all my friends for a while. I went with a coworker after work and  when we arrived around 7 Friday night there was no more seating. Luckily we walked around for 10 mins and found seats by the stool. We ordered a variety of seafood and red meat plates to compliment our chicken paella. The service was really good and the generous portions left me with another full dinner. Would highly recommend to others for a date or friendly outing, would also recommend making reservations first!"
,,,,,"The food here was absolutely delicious! Although the nutella  waffles weren't anything special, you need to try the Citrus french toast! We were all a bit hesitant to try it because of the unfamiliarity behind the concept. Once we did try it though, we were hooked! It was perfectly sweet from the honey and savory from the goat cheese, yet still had a hint of citrus to it. One thing to note. There are a lot of nice tables in this restaurant  for brunch but there is a spot that is dark and dingy and not ideal. Because we didn't specify, we were taken to the back dark area. Make sure to tell them you want a seat in an area with natural lighting. They have plenty of it!!"
,,,,,I have lived up the street from Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! for over a decade and frequent the restaurant often.  It's one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and a place that I often take visitors from out of town.  
,,,,,"The menu has changed a little over the years, but the food has remained consistently good.  Tapas is always fun and the sangria is good.  The ambiance is great.  It has a good vibe and is always full.  In the summer you can enjoy the patio.  At the risk of giving away my secrets, if you can't get a reservation go anyways and just snag a bar table.  There are plenty."
,,,,,Always love getting this when in Chicago!! Obviously always better dine-in but me and my mom got take out and it was very quick and easy & still delicious. They took all Covid-precautions & handed our food through a window. Perfect tapas place for sharing.
,,,,,Fun tapas spot to take out-of-towners to.  Great happy hour deal with app and drink specials.  But definitely go here outside if happy hour as they have some delicious lunch and dinner options.  Have tried a variety of things but the paella and lamb chops were the highlights.  
,,,,,Paella Mixta: 4.5/5
,,,,,Brussels Sprouts Salad: 4/5
,,,,,Octopus: 4/5
,,,,,Lamb Chops: 5/5
,,,,,Chicken & Ham Croquetas: 3.5/5
,,,,,Patatas Bravas: 3/5
,,,,,Deviled Eggs: 3/5
,,,,,"Definitely a great place to come and enjoy pitchers of sangria- fabulous tapas choices. We enjoyed the potatoes, octopus, berry waffles, Brussel sprout salad, dates wrapped in bacon breakfast sandwich. All were excellent and definitely a fabulous place to experience. The server was great. ."
,,,,,Oooh so delicious. There's a wide variety of sangrias- we opted for the white passion fruit and it was so yummy. The small plates were great. 
,,,,,I would recommend making a reservation- we made the mistake of coming on a seekend evening and the wait was close to 90 minutes. We got lucky and snagged a spot at the bar but it was a little crowded. 
,,,,,Are favorites were the gambas and goat cheese for sure and our least favorite was probably the lamb empanada. It had a good flavor but it was really small and nothing about it was really memorable. The service and ambiance was also on point!

,,,,,Classic Chicago restaurant. Great for groups and celebrations. The paella is delicious and every variation is more than worth the price. Good wine selection too.
,,,,,"One of my favorite restaurants while living in Chicago. The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is probably the best goat cheese based dish I've ever had anywhere. This dish alone is worth coming here. I usually go with friends on a Friday or Saturday night, which is usually packed so reservations ahead of time is a must on those nights. The atmosphere is very lively and the food and drinks are amazing. I always order the sangria and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. I've tried a variety of other dishes such as the grilled octopus, bacon wrapped dates and empanadas and never been disappointed. Great place to bring guests from out of town!"
,,,,,"Great ambiance, pretty good tapas  Was there on a Thursday and they had live Flamenco performance.  It was great!"
,,,,,This place really surprised me! The food here is great although it's a bit pricy for the portion sizes. But good Spanish food doesn't come by often so I can't complain too much. One of my favorite dishes is patatas braves and the one here is great! However their best dish is definitely the seafood paella! Good paella is hard to find so I'm so glad we were able to stop by this place!
,,,,,"Lots of great choices for tapas and delicious sangria! We got the White Peach Sangria which is light and fruity, perfect for a hot summer day. For tapas we got the Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce, Fried Green Peppers, Grilled Hanger Steak, and Pork Shoulder Paella. The paella was my favorite dish and I'd highly recommend it!! The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was also very good!"
,,,,,"I have been going to Cafe Ba-Ba for years! It's great for small and large parties. They are very accommodating. I've asked for the AC to be turned up, for a fan to be turned on etc. they always go the extra mile for customer service and the food is always amazing."
,,,,,"Get the butterscotch pudding for dessert, it's a must."
,,,,,"The food here is incredible, but it's really a great place for the environment and the sangria. "
,,,,,I got absolutely ranked with a bunch of friends and had a phenomenal time. 
,,,,,"Sangria really isn't event my thing, and it was a super pricey way to get Schlitterbahned but it was fun as it gets. "
,,,,,"The restaurant is beautiful, and I'm sure if I went back with a smaller party I'd have a more discreet time but if you're trying to get casual rowdy it is not a bad place to get that train rolling. "
,,,,,Cool place for like a sunny day in the winter too because they have great light but it actually stays pretty warm in there.
,,,,,A cute tapas restaurant located in Lincoln Park. Love the surrounding neighborhood.
,,,,,Tapas that I tried:
,,,,,-devil eggs (5/5): one of the best deviled eggs I've had; love the crispy ham on top!
,,,,,-chorizo with pepper: (3/5)
,,,,,-potato and onion omelette: (2/5)  
,,,,,-spicy potatoes with tomato aioli: MUST ORDER loved this even though i don't like potatos (5/5)
,,,,,-wood oven veggies with pine nuts: (3/5)
,,,,,-bacon dates with apple and vinaigrette: (4/5) i've had better bacon wrapped dates
,,,,,-beef empanadas: GET THIS! love how puffy the pastry was and how decadent the beef filling was (5/5)
,,,,,"Order the deviled eggs, spicy potatoes, and beef empanada."
,,,,,"And of course, try one of their sangrias!"
,,,,,"I ordered a pitcher of the classic red sangria, and it was a bit too much for 2 people. But the sangria was strong and good."
,,,,,I love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! By far my favorite tapas place in all of Chicago. I've been so many times and will keep coming back!
,,,,,"Brunch and dinner are both amazing! For dinner, I'd recommend a sangria pitcher (so good!) and getting lots of tapas. I usually go with a group so we can try a little of everything! Their paella is sooo good but it's huge so I'd only recommend that with a big group, because you def wanna have room for tapas too!"
,,,,,Brunch is awesome too - they have a brunch menu and you also can pick lots of options from the dinner menu. There's usually a breakfast paella too which is cool! The French toast is so refreshing!
,,,,,"Cool vibes in this place, and they're always fast and friendly. Amazing cute little desserts too!! "
,,,,,Can't wait til I go back again! I'll try to snap photos but I always forget because I'm so excited about the food!
,,,,,"This restaurant was a great place to visit after a busy day of exploring the city.  We arrived in the late evening on a Saturday night. The restaurant was very busy, and there was a wait to get a table. Luckily, since there was only two of us we were able to grab a couple of seats at the bar. "
,,,,,"We started our feast with white peach sangria. This was an excellent choice, as there was a large amount of fresh fruit in the sangria that gave it a deliciously crisp flavor. "
,,,,,"We decided to split some of their tapas dishes, which I highly recommend doing when you visit. The spicy potatoes with tomato aioli were just the right amount of crispiness.  The spice level of the potatoes was manageable, but I do like spicy foods.  We each ordered our own beef empanada, and this was a solid choice.  The pastry crust of the empanada was just the right amount of flakey, and the filling was well seasoned.  My favorite tapas dish we ordered was the buttermilk fried chicken thighs with piri piri sauce.  The chicken and sauce paired beautifully together for a delicious flavor.  Cafe Ba Ba Reeba has a fun, lively atmosphere and I highly recommend checking it out."

,,,,,"I'd never been to a breakfast/brunch tapas place before, and was so intrigued by the setup! The menu is fairly large with a good selection of both sweet and savory items, with some all-day selections as well if you didn't want to do brunch. I love that their menu marks off the popular items - something that I am guilty of asking my server about on a regular basis. "
,,,,,"I'm giving Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba full points for the originality of tapas for brunch and the vibe there is so cool (I love the wall of bread), but some of the food was hit of miss. The sausage fried paella rice was super bland and the pancakes were just so-so, but the French toast (especially the butter) blew me away, and I usually never order a sweet option at brunch. "
,,,,,I've been here for dinner too and it's just as cool. You won't regret coming here but I recommend researching the menu ahead of time!
,,,,,"Always a go to when folks are visiting from out of town or to just ball out on tapas. Love this place. Best to go with a large group of people so you can try everything and share. But I've definitely gone with just my girlfriend and we'll indulge ourselves. Food is impressive, and delicious. Fun at atmosphere. Won't break the bank either. Can't think of another restaurant that has better value compared to price"
,,,,,Came into Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! on a Sunday morning to sort of wind down a great long weekend in Chicago. This was on a long list of recommended brunch places our friends picked so we ended up choosing to come here and I'm very glad we did! 
,,,,,"We got a table for six pretty easily around noon on Sunday. The layout of the restaurant is pretty fun and there are pretty deliberately sectioned off parts of the restaurant. We were ushered to the back right of the establishment. Just glancing at the menu I knew this was probably going to be a great brunch. That, and the fact that there is an ""!"" in the name of the restaurant makes me expect big things."
,,,,,"The menu was big. Like reallllly big. There were breakfast/brunch options on one side, and then more lunch/dinner options on the other. Lots of dishes to choose from. We split three pitchers of sangria between the six of us throughout the brunch and it was delicious. We got the regular house red and the white peach. They don't put way too much ice in their pitchers like you see at some places, for which everyone was thankful."
,,,,,"As for the food, you'd think with a menu so big, everything might be one note and taste the same. That's definitely what I was expecting going into it. That was not the case AT ALL. We probably sampled 12-14 dishes between the six of us and each dish was unique and had its own flavor."
,,,,,"Some standouts for me: The Pan Catalan, bacon mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and the patatas bravas. All of these were incredibly tasty, and something I'd recommend you NEEDING to get while you're there. I thinkt the patatas bravas was my favorite. I've had them done a dozen different ways by different Spanish restaurants, but the sauce they put on them here really stuck out to me. It had a nice spicy kick but wasn't too much for people who aren't a huge fan of spice. Just really well done."
,,,,,"The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp and grits and the paella. The shrimp and grits were a little bland and the paella I thought was just sort of ""Meh."" I'm not a huge paella fan so take that with a grain of salt."
,,,,,"With all the dishes we had and the sangria, I'm pretty sure we all got out of there for less than $40 a person which was incredible considering we all had our fill of drink, and were stuffed to the brim with food. It's probably not the first place you think of when you hear ""authentic Spanish cuisine"" but it's pretty damn good. Only my second brunch in Chicago but I'd say if you're looking for some great food and sangria, this is your place."
,,,,,"Best restaurant in LP hands down! Bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes and the butterscotch pudding dessert. Always recommend making a reservation ahead of time. Sangria is delicious."
,,,,,"This restaurant gets super busy so make sure to make a reservation well in advance! This was one of my favorite spots I dined at in Chicago - the food and drinks were delicious! It's tapas style here- some come ready to try different dishes. The standouts to me were the red sangria, octopus, croquette, goat cheese, and the paella. There is also a cute ambiance to this restaurant and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful in deciding which dishes to order."
,,,,,"Ordered takeout on my first 2 visits and everything I had was soo good and fresh! I had the chicken and beef empanadas, paella mixta, beef tenderloin and blue cheese, and peach sangria. Will definitely be back again soon!"
,,,,,The waiting time was 1 hours and 45 minutes so we decided to sit by the bar. We pretty much ate and had drinks there we didn't wait for a table. Tapas were delicious the Sangrias weren't the best but they were ok.
,,,,,This place is absolutely delicious and the price was not bad at all! The things that I loved were the chiorzo wrapped dates and the flan! The dates were so sweet like candy and the salty and savory chiorzo went so well with them- such a great bite! The flan was so creamy and the caramel was amazing and tasted like honey! (the flan is small/tapas sized as well).
,,,,,"I normally dgaf about service when it comes to reviews..I mean, I just want good grub!"
,,,,,"However, they charge prices that I would expect not to be rushed out once we ask for the bill. They cleaned the table while we were waiting for the check, very invasively so, like reaching into our personal space. Then, the waitress could not give me 2 more mins for me to look up my lettuce eats number!"
,,,,,"Really, it put a damper to the food experience."
,,,,,The seafood paella is good but not the best I have ever had. The deviled egg is pretty delish and they earned a star there. The free Yelp check in dessert was very yummy! Affogato with some sherry instead of coffee (maybe she brought us the wrong dessert?) but it was YUUUMMMMY! Two more stars for the dessert! 
,,,,,"Don't know if I'll return. Recommendations for good paella, anyone?"
,,,,,Oh! They sear some good scallops. Perfect searing.
,,,,,"We recently visited Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba twice in one week, and it has already become a standing choice for birthday celebrations or for impressing out of towners. "
,,,,,"You should definitely get a reservation, especially if you're visiting for dinner on a weekend, as we did. This place was packed and popping both times we visited, and I'd hate to imagine what the waiting times would be like."
,,,,,"Tapas are best experienced in a group setting, so be sure to go with at least 4-5 people. The menu design highlights crowd favorites/chef recommendations in red, and has at least 7-8 options for vegetables, seafood, lamb, chicken, and beef. Here are some of our favorites:"
,,,,,"1. The classic red sangria - we shared a pitcher among 4 people, and it was an instant favorite! A single class costs $7, so a pitcher for $26 is money saved."
,,,,,"2. Patatas bravas - delicious with just the right amount of spicy kick, with an addictive chipotle mayo sauce."
,,,,,"3. Goat cheese in tomato sauce - perfect comfort food! Super creamy, and perfectly paired with garlic bread."
,,,,,4. Buffalo fried chicken - another crowd pleaser! The chicken is fried and seasoned to perfection.
,,,,,"Paella - our server informed us that the paella is cooked to order, and would take 30-40 minutes to prepare. The paella came out just as we had finished the tapas, and we tried the required minimum 2 servings of the seafood paella and the chicken paella. I really liked the seafood paella but I was already really full and I couldn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked to."
,,,,,"Do not miss the super awesome Yelp check in offer. The free dessert is one per PERSON, not per TABLE, so we went nuts and had 6-7 dessert dishes, including the flan, the custard pudding, and the chocolate cake. The custard pudding was by far my favourite, and the dessert tapas are the perfect way to end a meal."
,,,,,"Service is great, and the servers are attentive, well informed, and spot on with their suggestions. If you want to split the bill amongst a number of people, please speak to the server beforehand and they'll happily accommodate you."
,,,,,"Both times, we split the cheque by 8, with reach person getting 2-3 tapas, a couple of glasses of sangria, a plate of paella, and a free dessert tapa, which is really reasonable!"

,,,,,second time here and had another great group meal. Waiter was super receptive and had awesome suggestions. They sat us 20 minutes after our reservation but made up for it with one of each of their delicious deserts. Have suggested this place to many friends- it doesn't disappoint!
,,,,,"One of the best spots in Chicago! We love their food and sangria. Tapas are so tasty. Batatas bravas every time, shrimp, brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and so fun for groups to share and try a little of a lot of things. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,Food is good. Loved paella mixta! So delicious! The atmosphere wasn't anything exciting but the staff was professional and attentive. The paella is what would keep me coming back again and again! Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the spicy potatoes; everybody raves how good they are but I was unimpressed. The potatoes seemed hard and flavorless. The aioli was ok.
,,,,,"Great tapas, always amazing paella. It's got classic, robust but authentic flavors that bring authenticity to Chicago."
,,,,,"We ordered the brunch tapas menu for delivery during Restaurant Week. Enormous portions, excellent food (the best flan and French toast were some of the best I have had in a while), and a complimentary sangria with each meal. Excellent value for money, delivered right to your door! We are looking forward to visiting in person once we're vaccinated."
,,,,,"I lived in Spain for four months so I have a pretty high standard for Spanish food. However, I thought this place was great! "
,,,,,"I came for a private party so I can't say much about the ambiance but the food was very yummy. I definitely recommend the potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, Caesar salad, white sangria, and chocolate truffle dessert."
,,,,,"Very convenient curbside pickup! Highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates, bread with goat cheese and tomato sauce, chicken empanada, and stuffed mushrooms! There are many tapas choices and their paella is full of flavor. Everything they say about the short rib is true. Do not skip trying it!"
,,,,,Yes!!!! So freaking good. Endless options. Huge restaurant. No wait on a Friday night despite being packed. Favorites were the potato salad and the dates! Food comes out as it ready as it's tapas style. Pitcher of sangria gave us about 6 glasses.
,,,,,"This is the kind of place where you bring people who are visiting you from out of town. That's how good it is. First of all, the ambience is really cool in there. The bar is beautiful, and the restaurant itself is architecturally pleasing and nicely lit. The hostesses all greeted us with warm inviting smiles, and then seated the three of us."
,,,,,"We got a pitcher of the CLASSIC SANGRIA which was delicious. For tapas we got the ANCHOVY TOAST which I found very good even with my disdain for anchovies! We got the PAPAS BRAVAS which were some of the best I've ever had, and we also ordered the FRIED CHICKEN tapa which was my favorite. For PAELLA, we got 2 of the small ones. The SEAFOOD, and the CHICKEN PAELLA. "

,,,,,A great tapas place!!
,,,,,A group of us chose this spot to start of our girls weekend on a Friday night. Well-known for their sangria; we started off with a pitcher (or two) while looking over the menu. 
,,,,,"The servers were extremely helpful and knew the menu inside & out. They were able to give great suggestions. Because the restaurant serves tapas, our group of 10 split into 2 groups of 5 when we ordered- to make for easier sharing. They do have a few vegetarian/vegan options on the menu- I had the moroccan chickpea stew which was so delicious. "
,,,,,Make sure to check in on yelp and redeem your offer for a free dessert! We did a few to share- each one was delectable. 
,,,,,This place was PACKED on a Friday- make sure to get reservations!
,,,,,"Favorite tapas restaurant! Never a disappointment. Tried almost all tapas from their menu. Last time we actually ordered sea food paella, it was very good! Sangria is one of my favorite drinks and at Cafe they do great job making it and have a good variety. Our server gave us great suggestion when it came to desert. "
,,,,,Only recommendation is to make sure you make reservations before you go in. The wait can be a pain in you know what 
,,,,,Love the fact that they have 4 seasons porch. 
,,,,,They offer brunch as well as lunch. Are children  friendly with kids menu. Also offer gluten free chooses! 
,,,,,Thumbs up!
,,,,,I went back to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and had the opposite experience! My server was attentive and offered so many suggestions. The food and drinks were great! 
,,,,,The manager reached out after my last my review but never followed up with me which is disappointing but I could not be happier with my last visit.
,,,,,"I appreciate this place so much for their Covid measures, they took our temperature upon entering and the tables were so spread out."
,,,,,"I love this place and was so upset with our visit. Our waitress did not come over once after taking our order until we had to flag her down because we wanted our check. Not to ask if we wanted another drink, ask how our food was, etc. Throughout our meal we had wanted to order another drink and more food but were unable to because of the lack of service. We were seated in a back room so I believe we had just been forgotten about."
,,,,,The food was good but unfortunately the awful service was what I took away from our visit.
,,,,,"Before you even get here, make a reservation as the restaurant is always super packed! It is also pretty loud, as this place is way bigger than it seems, so if you're looking for a nice quiet dinner this is not the place to go. "
,,,,,"To start off with, I got the pinxto platter, and I was such a fan of the Bacalao Croquette and the Deviled Egg. For our tapas plates, as there was only two of us, we got 4-one from each of the sections. We got the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, moroccan spiced lamb kebabs, seared sea scallops, and the chicken and ham croquetas. I was a fan of all of them, especially the croquetas and scallops. The croquetas practically melted in your mouth, and the scallops were just the right consistency. "
,,,,,"The only thing I will say is that they were sending our dishes out super fast at the beginning, and then we waited about 20 minutes for simply our scallops. It seemed like they weren't spacing the dishes out very well. "
,,,,,"Overall, I think it lived up to the hype, and I will definitely be here again to try everything else on the menu"
,,,,,"I would only recommend this place during happy hours because it's such a steal for the deals they do. I recommend any of the potato salad, empanadas, or sangrias. "
,,,,,"I definitely suggest ordering their specials as well. We had the fried squash, which I was hesitant about, but it was the best of the 4-5 dishes we ordered that night. Service is good, but definitely try and RSVP as they fill up quickly."
,,,,,"It took 7 years, a gift certificate from the boss and 20 years of marriage. Finally... "
,,,,,Cafe BA-BA-REEEEBA!! 
,,,,,"We ditched our resi in the main room and sat in the bar, then Maggie told us it was happy hour!! LUCKY, let's go! "
,,,,,"Well, it WAS fantastic. Laura chose the Bacon Wrapped Dates as her fave, Ron said the Scallops were AMAZing, Joanne commented the Stuffed Mushrooms hit the mark and mine was the Anchovy stuffed olive with a Piquillo Pepper. "
,,,,,"Paired with a pitcher of sangria and several other dishes, this was a great dinner and incredible experience "

,,,,,"The gripes that  I have were with the libation portion of the meal. The water was served lukewarm & the sangria was extremely watered down due to the heavy dose of ice. Most of the dishes we tried were good with the exception of the ""sausage rice"". It had no flavor & tasted no different than any typical fried rice. We started with the ""pintxos platter"" & while everything was virtually bite sized it was tasty. The ""shrimp & grits"" wasn't the tastiest version of the dish but I've had far worse. The chicken sausage was pretty damn good but get maybe two servings if you're hungry. The eggs Benedict with Serrano ham was good however the first time I had real ""jamón serrano"" I remember being wowed by the flavor however that wasn't my experience here. The highlight of my meal was definitely the ""sweet sherry flight"" as I love aperitifs as well as digestifs. The prices are fair but to get a hefty meal you'll spend quite a lot. On this Sunday morning parking was free."
,,,,,"My first observation of this place was that it is huge! They have several dining room sections and was packed when we went in for a 1:30 brunch reservation. Since we chose a later brunch time we were able to select from the brunch menu or regular dinner/ lunch menu. It also happened to be restaurant week, so there was a prix fixe brunch menu that included a drink of your choice (sangria, mimosa, or a trip to their Bloody Mary bar), 2 brunch tapas, and a dessert for $24. "
,,,,,We tried 8 brunch tapas between our party of 4 and were stuffed when we walked out! 
,,,,,- bocadillo cubano: English muffin Cuban sandwich served with their delicious (and a bit spicy) house looks potatoes. Not the easiest to split but very tasty! 
,,,,,- shrimp and grits: the shrimp were lightly bartered and seasoned well. The grits  could have used a little bit more flavour but I am also not a huge grit person in the first place 
,,,,,"- jamón serrano benidict: yummy eggs benny with thin cut jamon and a perfectly runny egg. Again kind of hard to share, but we made it work. Also served with the awesome house potatoes. "
,,,,,"- citrus French toast with goat cheese butter: I liked this dish but the table was divided on it. It is not very sweet and tastes very much like goat cheese, so if you are not into that maybe avoid it   Served with fresh fruit and a good choice if you don't like your French toast too sweet. "
,,,,,"- bacon mac: yummy creamy mac. The bacon is a bit of an after thought just placed on top and not very ""breakfasty"" but still a  crowd pleaser "
,,,,,"-sausage paella: pretty good paella, maybe a little greasier than I would like (most likely due to the sausage). The egg was perfectly runny. "
,,,,,- spinach artichoke crepe: awesome creamy aMd savory crepe but very difficult to share easily. 
,,,,,Everything we ordered was tasty. The brunch tapas were not really set up for sharing easily like typical tapas but we were still able to  share  everything. The red sangria was really good and pretty boozy. 
,,,,,Our waitress was very  nice but never could keep up with a what had been delivered to  the table so kept having to ask. 
,,,,,"Overall solid meal, but I would want to go back and try their traditional tapas as brunch is not their  primary forte."
,,,,,This is a classic spot and usually great for large parties. They even have a gluten friendly menu!
,,,,,So why 3 stars? I just really think there are better places to eat. I never leave here without a stomach ache. The food is all heavy and very oily. My parents LOVE this place (mostly because I think they are fans of the tapas style in particular) but coming here for me is preparing to indulge in food that I would not otherwise choose to indulge.
,,,,,Great tapas and sangria. They messed up our order had ordered the paella but the manager was kind enough to apologize and sent us complimentary desserts.

,,,,,"We didn't eat too much but what we did have made me want to come back for more! The enviroment on the patio is great (covid note- lots of space between tables and every team member wore masks and gloves). The staff was super nice and helpful in making our covid experience the best it could be. And I'm impressed by the size of menu they have for a tapas place. We started with drinks. Their sangria flight is a great way to try all of the sangria. The classic red was my favorite but the black raspberry was a close second. Austin had the mezcal mule which was delicious! They we had the brussel sprout salad which was full of flavor and freshness, along with the peri peri chicken which had a nice kick to it without being over powering. But the flavor there was unmatched! If you get anything get this plate. Although we didn't try any they did have vegan and vegetarian options available. We will definitely be back to try more tasty plates."
,,,,,"I hope they never close, as much as I miss eating at Cafe BaBaReeba, their delivery comes close second,!arriving at the right temperature and the ease of not having to wait for a table. The quality has stood the test of time, please continue to do what you Do!"
,,,,,"LOVE THIS PLACE! food is so great,sangria so great, service is spectacular and the price is amazing. You'll have a great time!"
,,,,,"I always love a good Sunday brunch, and Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is a great place to have one with a mimosa, bloody mary, or sangria (the've got red and white varieties)."
,,,,,"Tapas-style small plates are the way to go here, and some outstanding ones are the meatballs, eggplant, goat cheese in tomato sauce, beef tenderloin, and octopus."
,,,,,"A giant space divided into multiple rooms, it seats many. Often a destination for families with kids, but the hosts do a nice job of seating us in a quieter room when they can. "
,,,,,"Located in a heavily foot-trafficked area, this can be difficult to get to if you need your own parking. Uber and public transporation may be the better way to go."
,,,,,"This is hands down my favorite tapas place in Chicago. The waiters are always super knowledgeable, and the food is soooo good. I always always always get the croquetas and patatas bravas. I haven't tried a dish I didn't like at this place yet, and I try something new every time."
,,,,,"They no longer serve bread and butter with the tapas and essential part of tapas, take away one star. The tortilla was all burnt brown on the bottom and it was served warm not chilled , take away another star. The goat cheese with tomato sauce had no taste at all , minus another star. The overall experience was weak minus a star. The dates with bacon got them the one star they earned. Not going back for a while, till they improve their game. Have been eating there since the mid 90s, so I remember when it supposed to be like!"
,,,,,Oh man this place is good! I've been here many times and walk away each time feeling full but satisfied. This is great for a nice casual dinner with friends or loved ones but can even be a nice romantic place for a date night.
,,,,,The staff is always friendly and helpful if you have questions on the menu. The food is beyond delicious and brought out in a timely manner. Always make a reservation because this place fills up quickly.
,,,,,This is usually my favorite spot and where I take out of town guests. Had a 4:30 reservation on Saturday. Service was friendly and we were sat promptly. I was comfortable with the COVID measures as well. I felt that the food quality was lacking. Chicken and Vegetable Paella was over cooked and lacked flavor. The goat cheese and marinara sauce also appeared overcooked and on the dry side. The mango seasonal sangria was delicious.
,,,,,"Hi Heather, "
,,,,,"I'm sorry to hear of your recent less than acceptable experience with us, especially in regards to the Paella and some of our signature tapas you received. Customer feedback is very important to us and your comment has been reviewed with our culinary team. "
,,,,,We appreciate your time and look forward to making your next visit with us an exceptional dining experience. 
,,,,,Thank you!
,,,,,"The best tapas in Chicago. We've eaten here countless times when we lived in Chicago, including our wedding reception 6 years ago."
,,,,,This being a LYE restaurant is a bonus. 
,,,,,Everything on this menu is fantastic. Absolute favorites are;
,,,,,Brussel sprout salad - never would've imagined liking a brussel sprout salad
,,,,,Empanadas
,,,,,Garlic shrimp
,,,,,Scallops
,,,,,Chicken and ham Croquettes
,,,,,Sausage plate
,,,,,Lamb kababs (not a daily item)
,,,,,Wish they open one in Phoenix.
,,,,,THE PAELLA!!! THE SANGRIA!!! THE BREAD!!!
,,,,,"cafe babareeba is a spanish dream come true. the food is exquisite and a must-visit when one is in chicago. plus, the sangria pitchers (especially  the passion fruit sangria) are life-changing and enhances any of the plates that you order. you order plates tapas-style (plus the paella if you choose to get it, but get ready to eat fewer tapas because the paella is hefty and will very quickly fill you up) and there is a HUGE selection to choose from -- i personally recommend the patatas bravas if you've never had them. "
,,,,,"service is a little on the slow side because the restaurant is so busy during peak hours, but the tastes of the food make up for the slow service. plus, they give you unlimited free bread and honestly, this also makes up for it. "

,,,,,"Had a WONDERFUL meal here with my daughter when I was there dropping her for college at DePaul. We were STARVING- the day we arrived, after moving all her stuff into the dorm. Was so wanting paella as we can not get it in Nashville but the 45 minute wait and minimum of 2 orders when we wanted to try other things and we COULD NOT WAIT  45 minutes to eat.  So, we got garlic shrimp, shredded Brussel sprout salad and I forget what other amazeballs small plate that was one of the best things I ever put in my mouth.  The crusty bread and the olive oil worthy of drinking straight up were SO AMAZING! Can't wait to go back another time when I'm not ready to eat my own hand and wait the 45 minutes for the paella. It looked and smelled worth the wait. "
,,,,,Out server was SO KIND! And the ambiance is warm and fun! Loved it!
,,,,,Made reservations for Wednesday night at 9 PM. Didn't get to see all of the inside but I love the decor of the place from what I saw. 
,,,,,We ordered the following:
,,,,,"-Spicy Potatoes: For how many reviews I read that said these were amazing, I was expecting a lot more. It tasted like normal potatoes. I wish we passed on this and ordered something else more enticing on the menu. "
,,,,,-Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms: These were delicious and really flavorful. Favorite thing that we ordered. 
,,,,,-Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce: Can you really go wrong with goat cheese... yummm.
,,,,,I also got the blackberry sangria. It tasted like straight up juice. I like my sangrias a little more alcoholic. 
,,,,,In conclusion: I'd come again - they have a lot of vegetarian options that I want to explore.
,,,,,Posting this review late. Yelp was crashing on me when I was trying to do it originally. But absolutely delish! Atmosphere is warm and personal. The tapas are perfect for people who don't mind sharing food. The sangria is flavorful and refreshing! I wish the experience were fresher in my mind because I would love to add more details -- but a definite must visit if you are in town.
,,,,,"Spanish tapas & sangria? Count me in. It was our first time here and I'm sure there will be plenty more visits in the future. Don't forget to make reservations ahead of time, especially if dining on the weekends. We were lucky enough to get last minute reservations on a Friday night. The place was already packed even before 6 p.m."
,,,,,Right off the bat we got a pitcher of the white peach sangria. Had just the right amount of sweetness and was super refreshing. Probably could have drank the whole pitcher to myself it was THAT good.
,,,,,"For the tapas, we got a little too excited and ordered more food that our stomachs could handle. Between the two of us we ordered 6 plates and a dessert, which were:"
,,,,,- Chorizo wrapped dates (#1)
,,,,,- Deviled egg (#5)
,,,,,- Spicy potatoes & tomato aioli (#30)
,,,,,- Citrus cured salmon (#40)
,,,,,- Octopus (#43)
,,,,,"- Serrano ham, salchichon, & chorizo (#61)"
,,,,,- Caramelized banana
,,,,,"Very satisfied with all the items we ordered. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back and try more, especially the paella. "
,,,,,"They also have happy hour at the bar Monday-Friday from 4 to 6 and Friday/Saturday 10 to midnight, which includes $16 pitchers of the classic sangria, $1 pintxos, and select tapas for less than $3.50."
,,,,,*Don't forget to check in on Yelp to redeem a free dessert! Highly recommended the caramelized banana.
,,,,,"One of the best happy hours in Chicago!! The sangria and tapas are delicious, and everything is such a good deal. "
,,,,,The sangria pitchers are $16 for ~6 glasses which is a great deal. I love that it's not too sweet and also all the yummy fruit left in it.
,,,,,The tapas are also a steal for $1-$2.50 per plate. I'm vegetarian and loved all of their vegetarian options. The garlic potato salad was AMAZING and I usually never like potato salad. The crispy potatoes were delicious and the spicy sauce that came with them was the best! The chickpea stew was also super flavorful and great for the winter.
,,,,,"Overall, we had great service and a great experience! I will definitely be back."
,,,,,"Went here for Father's Day and it was the perfect celebration spot. Our waiter was extremely clear with the menu and very hospitable. Their sangria is to die for! We had their daily special (mango) and it was absolutely delicious. The food was out of this world. We had a few tapas while we waited for our paella (the paella takes about 30-45 minutes so order as soon as possible - it's worth the wait!) and while everything was fantastic, I can't rave enough about their bacon wrapped dates. It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. Even after all the food we ordered, I HAD to get a second order of the dates. I could eat those all day if I could. "
,,,,,The atmosphere was perfect for a celebration or just a nice evening out. The lighting was warm and gentle and perfect for sitting back and enjoying a nice drink and meal. 
,,,,,Definitely coming back here but until then I'll happily enjoy my leftovers - there's plenty of it.
,,,,,"It seems that covid has put a strain on the supply and menu at cafe ba ba reeba due to the shut down. They have revised and shortened their menu, and unfortunately some of my favorite dishes have not survived. The server that we had was very attentive and personable. Food came out hot and fresh and in a timely manner. The negatives that stood out were the following 1: the busser took dishes that we were not finished with multiple times. One of which was the shrimp that comes in delicious garlic oil. We told the server and she got us more garlic oil-- score! Except the busser came and threw it away again, without asking! 2. No serving silverware was provided, so we were forced to use shared utensils to divide portions to each other (during a pandemic) 3. We had to repeatedly ask for fresh plates, and we were left with the same dirty silverware the entire time. Overall the ambiance was nice and service good. It was pretty busy for a Monday night, and so we were asked to leave because they were getting backed up, to be fair they do notify you that they have a time limit, but for customers that paid almost $400 dollars for dinner, it seems a little crass to ask them to leave"
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! offers an amazing atmosphere and even better food. I've been for tapas and cocktails as well as sit-down dinner service, and both experiences were fantastic. I'd definitely recommend the paella!"
,,,,,"Excellent brunch! It's definitely a good idea to get more than one tapas item off the menu, and add some sangria to the mix! "
,,,,,"The bread is amazing to start off with. The brussel sprouts salad is also delicious and a great appetizer. I shared the veggie Benedict with a friend and loved this fish. Very flavorful, and the patatas bravas are tasty and spicy. I also had the iberco ham hash, which was pretty yummy as well."
,,,,,"Dessert tapas were great too. The flan was average, but it went well with the afogato, which is like coffee ice cream in a sherry float. "
,,,,,"The service was slow on this busy Sunday morning, but we had a great time! I am always up for some good tapas!"
,,,,,"Very crowded on a Saturday night, so be sure to make a reservation! We didn't mind sitting at the bar, and we enjoyed the fresh bread and red sangria. "
,,,,,"We weren't very hungry but needed to try some of these excellent dishes. We ordered the grilled octopus first- the best octopus I have had. The texture was so deliciously chewy, and the sauce flavorful and rich. Even the potatoes were excellent. We also ordered the cured salmon after seeing another party get it. It was like a Spanish version of lox, but tasty nonetheless. "
,,,,,"I would love to come back and try the other tapas on the menu. I also used my check in offer for the cherry streudel dessert- which was quite tasty too. I loved the tapas portions, good for people not too hungry but enough for the whole party to take a bite."
,,,,,"I was looking for a brunch spot and came across this place. It was busy, so make sure you make reservations. For those that enjoy tapas this is a great place. Here is the breakdown:"
,,,,,FOOD
,,,,,"The tapa selection was great. I enjoyed the deviled eggs, the pork belly lollipop, paella, burata and many other small dishes.

For drinks we order a sangria jar and we split with the table. Very refreshing. "

,,,,,"We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. I'm glad we had a reservation because there was a ton of people in line waiting for tables. The inside is divided in to separate rooms, so it is a more cozy/romantic vibe than a ""hot spot."" We tried a bunch of different tapas, all were pretty good, I'd give all the food 3-4/5 stars. We got a pitcher of sangria and that was 5/5 though! Tasty AND strong. Service was good and we would probably come back again sometime."
,,,,,"Everything tastes like it came from the freezer to be honest. I was excited to take my friend here from out of town because I had heard such good things about it, and we were both disappointed to say the least. I wanted to love this place, but I probably wouldn't come back sadly :/"
,,,,,What a gem of a place.  Came here tonight for the first time and it was such an awesome experience!  The food tastes good and the ambiance of the place is superb!  Will come back again for sure.
,,,,,I am really impressed with the service at this location. We had a private party and the service and the food was amazing. We had 25 people and everything was preordered and when we gave them the heads up we were ready everything came out on a timely manner. Wow.
,,,,,Ugh I love this place. My mouth is always watering. Tapas are the move here and I suggest if you're in a group everyone orders one thing and you all family style eat!
,,,,,My favorites:
,,,,,-Brussels sprouts
,,,,,-burrata (SO good ugh you won't regret it!!!)
,,,,,-charcuterie board
,,,,,-goat cheese in tomato sauce
,,,,,-rioja braised short rib (it melts in your mouth and tbh I didn't share this one because it was the best short rib I've had in my 24 years)
,,,,,-make sure someone gets PAELLA. So freaking good and it's mixed in front of you in a huge hot pan and served steaming hot
,,,,,"Oh, how we LOVE Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! The ambiance and service are amazing. We typically start with anywhere from 3-8 tapas between the two of us, staggering them between half pitchers of different flavors of sangria, and finishing our meal with a few servings of paella. Everything is delicious! We have not had a single dish that we didn't like. That said, the potato salad and ham & cheese croquettes are an absolute must."
,,,,,Absolutely love what Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has to offer. Every dining experience with them is excellent and I do recommend a number of the apps as well as the sangria. Cant really go wrong with any flavor.
,,,,,"Over the years, this has been one of our favorite restaurants!  The food is absolutely delicious.  The service is outstanding.  And the atmosphere transports you to a magical vacation ambiance, so you just want to linger and keep eating!  Our family recently enjoyed a delightful New Year's Eve dinner here, and I want to publicly acknowledge their wonderful front desk hostess, Anita.  She not only juggles answering the phone with genuine warmth, but also kindly and patiently accommodates the requests of customers coming in the front door.  Anita's smiling presence sets the tone for an enjoyable dining experience.  We also appreciated the excellent, attentive service by everyone.  For those who want a delightful meal, I highly recommend Café Ba-Ba-Reeba!"
,,,,,Amazing!  The best food I had while visiting Chicago hands-down. It appears that you cannot go wrong with anything your order because it was all delicious!  
,,,,,"For a party of 4, they recommended 2 dishes per person, we were skeptical and considered ordering more, but the 2 dishes per person turned out perfect - almost too much food.  "
,,,,,Some of the highlights include
,,,,,"- Red sangria,  very tasty, not too sweet and they give you a ton!"
,,,,,-Meatballs with Sherry Tomato Sauce
,,,,,-Chorizo-Wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese (Probably my favorite)
,,,,,-Burrata with Catalan Tomato Bread
,,,,,-Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli
,,,,,"-Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes"
,,,,,-Brussels Sprouts Salad
,,,,,"This is one of those places where you wish you were still hungry so you could order more food!  Everything was excellent, service was great, atmosphere was amazing.  Highly recommended!"
,,,,,"Pretty overrated in my opinion - I'll start with the ambiance, It is a cool restaurant but its HUGE! way bigger than I expected it to be.. The food was very sub-par. I ordered the Brussel sprout salad and it was very boring and dry. I also ordered the salmon which was very plain and the 'roasted veggies' it came with were almost non-existent and drenched in oil. I will say the olive oil they have at the table for the bread is really tasty - probably the highlight of my meal to be honest. "

,,,,,"This place does Spanish tapas right! With its moody Spanish atmosphere, big pitchers of sangria (from the tap), and delicious and fairly priced tapas, this place has become a new favorite for me. I went to this place for Happy hour with a friend and this was a great move as pitchers of sangria were 16$ (probably 6 glasses per pitcher) and they had about 10 amazing tapas on their HH menu that ranged from about 2-5 in price. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates (yes-do get), the beef empanadas (also yum), the patatas bravas (simple but done well and served with a delicious aioli) and the Spanish tomato bread with manchego (good but nothing special). We also ordered the garlic shrimp and the goat cheese in tomato sauce with bread. The goat cheese dish was recommended to me and though it was tasty, I didn't find it to be anything that special- also could have been that I was pretty full at that point ."
,,,,,With all this food and a pitcher of sangria- our bill came out to around $50 so a great value and a really fun evening! Definitely will be returning. Will say that for HH we were able to walk right in to the bar and sit down but around 630 it started getting super packed so probably will make a reservation if I go back at dinner time.
,,,,,"Great food, good atmosphere. Truly something different every time as there are so many options to choose from, and I really enjoy it mixing it up."
,,,,,"Service is a bit slow but the waiters are always friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoy coming here for dates / 1 on 1 dinners as opposed to groups, as I find the food coming out randomly a bit hard to adjust to when in a bigger group. Unless you're truly sharing with all people at the table, I often feel uncomfortable eating when others don't have anything yet. "
,,,,,Not everything on the menu is stellar but I always leave full and happy.
,,,,,Came to share tapas and it was a fine experience but I'd only reorder the buttermilk chicken thighs if I came back.
,,,,,"Deviled egg - 3/5. Decent bite, not so interesting"
,,,,,French toast - 2/5. Minimal maple syrup. Fine toast itself but nothing jumping out.
,,,,,Patatas Bravas - 2/5. Some crispy bites but not as good as other tapas places I've been. 
,,,,,Burrata with bread - 3/5. Healthy portion of Burrata.  But still not a ton of flavor so disappointing.
,,,,,Buttermilk chicken thighs - 4/5. Quite tasty. Really flavorful sauce for the chicken.
,,,,,Caramelized banana - 3/5. Nice crisp to the bananas.
,,,,,"Another great Chicago find with awesome open patio seating and spacing to accommodate COVID-19 changes. Our server took great care of us making recommendations when appropriate and checking back often to make sure we always had plenty of tapas on the table and on the way. We stuck with the half pitcher of classic red sangria, which was just right for our party of two.  Next time, I want to come back hungrier ;)"
,,,,,"4th time here!  This time - ordered the seafood paella for 2 and it was very tasty! My boyfriend also got the mango sangria. However, you couldn't really taste the mango. It had 2 pieces of apple, 1 piece of orange, 1 piece of lemon...so maybe that's why?? "
,,,,,"The paella took about 30 minutes to arrive at our table. Good thing we had some yummy bread to hold us over! The entree comes with a side of aioli and some lemon. Overall, the paella is super delicious and filling! $17 per person but they add a lot of seafood. "
,,,,,"As for tapas, my favorite is the potatoes!! 5 stars!! Sometimes it can be overcooked though, which it was 1 out of the 3 times i've gotten it."

,,,,,Amazing! Best spot ever! 10/10 love it! Amazing food and great service! Definitely get the bacon wrapped dates and sangria. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
,,,,,We arrived on a Friday evening right before a 1.5 hour waitlist started due to reservations (around 5:30). We were seated and the menu was explained to us by our server. Water and bread were brought to the table immediately - there was olive oil on the table with salt and pepper but no other spices or balsamic vinegar. Dipping bread in olive oil wasn't my jam so I left it to my partner. We ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria and absolutely enjoyed it throughout our meal. 
,,,,,"We ordered the Potato and Onion Omelette and the Goat Cheese Baked with Tomato Sauce. The omelette was served with what I believe was a garlic aioli, not bad overall but nothing to write home about. "
,,,,,"The Goat Cheese Baked with Tomato Sauce was served with crispy, thinly-sliced garlic bread - I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and once I ran out of the garlic crisps, I used the bread table to finish the remainder of the dish. "
,,,,,We ordered the chicken paella - their paella is priced per serving with a minimum of two servings to order. Kind of a bummer if you are interested in a different type of paella than other people at your table. The paella itself was a little salty but good. 
,,,,,We were there for a date and the servers were a little too attentive for my taste. I felt like we were being checked in on every 5 minutes - just a bit much for me but that's a personal preference. 
,,,,,"Overall, great atmosphere and good food. I would definitely return, probably not for the paella, but definitely for the tapas and sangria!"
,,,,,Nice tapas place.
,,,,,"Fun atmosphere and setting.  We ate somewhere that felt like it had a retractable roof.  When we were seated I felt like I was sitting outside, so I glanced around and noticed the roof looked like it moved."
,,,,,"Cool place to eat, drink, and have a good time.  The food was pretty good, but I've had better tapas at other places."
,,,,,Tapas and Sangria -- what's not to love? Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does spanish cuisine justice!
,,,,,"We've tried to make reservations here multiple times over the last couple of months, and have had no luck. Earlier this week, we were able to snag a reservation for dinner. "
,,,,,"The restaurant has a great ambiance that still feels intimate despite the size of the space. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and provided great recommendations re: food and drink. He also mentioned that everything comes out as it's prepared, so that he would stagger our order to give us some breathing room between dishes. "
,,,,,"We had the bacon wrapped dates, which are a must-have. Frankly, I could have told the kitchen to just keep 'em coming they were so good. We also ordered the seared cana de cabra -- this is like a seared goat cheese with caramelized onions and honey. It's the perfect balance of salty and sweet."
,,,,,"Other winners were the patatas bravas -- spicy potatoes with an tomato aioli. The albondigas were insane -- tender pork meatballs in a savory tomato sauce. And lastly, the ham and chicken croquetas are a must have."
,,,,,"We also ordered the beef short rib, which I thought was tasty, but would probably order something different the next time I return. I've got my eye on the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce.. are you seeing a trend here?!"
,,,,,"A Chicago staple that never disappoints! This was the very first restaurant I ate when I first move to Chicago, 8 years ago. And it still remains a favorite, and where I take friends whenever they visit. "
,,,,,"Last weekend, we had a friend visiting from Cali, and since I consider Ba-Ba-Reeba a true Chicago staple, we booked a reservation for Sunday brunch. This was my first time here for brunch, and it was just as good as ever. Ba-Ba-Reeba is a huge restaurant, but always super crowded, so highly recommend getting a reservation. For brunch they offered both brunch tapas, and some of their classic dinner favs. Awesome, because we decided to get a mixture of the two. Classics that always stand out are the grilled hanger steak, burrata, brussels sprouts, and octopus. We tried a few brunch items, like the shrimp and grits and sausage paella rice with egg, both excellent! There really isn't a dish I've had here that I didn't enjoy. "
,,,,,"The sangria is also out of this world! Go with a pitcher, because it's a great deal if having more than 1. My favorite is the classic red, but they also offer seasonal ones which are unique. "
,,,,,"Needless to say, Ba-Ba-Reeba knows what they are doing when it comes to tapas and the perfect environment for a group! Reasonably priced too. Highly highly recommend if you've never been here."

,,,,,Love this spot - my girlfriends and I always love coming here to get some food and drinks to catch up. Sangria flights are my favorite thing about this place. Their food is incredible -- I would never have tried bacon wrapped dates on my own but a friend recommended it and they were amazing.
,,,,,After dining here Saturday night I can see why they have such staying power in a VERY competitive market. Every thing was well done. 
,,,,,We had reservations & were seated immediately when we arrived. ;) 
,,,,,"The place was packed but service was great. Our server was excellent, made a great wine recommendation, all of their wines are Spanish & we weren't familiar with them but she led us in the right direction. "
,,,,,"They place bread on the table with olive oil, the water was filled before you ran out. Just great attention to detail. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious, we started with olives & deviled egg, yum."
,,,,,"Then we had bacon wrapped dates. Chicken chorizo skewers, chicken meatballs, cherry tomato sauce was awesome! Every dish was delicious. "
,,,,,Will definitely go again when in Lincoln Park.
,,,,,Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is my favorite tapas place in Chicago. 
,,,,,"I've been multiple times: my friend has his birthday dinner here every year, and I recently came with a large party for a work dinner. "
,,,,,The venue is a bit dark and lit mostly with candles. Great for a date! It's usually bustling as they have great happy hour deals as well. 
,,,,,"Pros: I've gotten almost everything on the menu... favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, burrata, heirloom tomato salad, grilled octopus, short rib, hanger steak, and the white peach sangria. They're also a Lettuce Entertainment You restaurant (probably one of the top options, too). "
,,,,,Cons: We got the vegetable paella once which was mostly like fried rice -- not worth it in my opinion and there are many other fantastic vegetarian options. Their food can be on the salty side and they are strict on checking IDs - my friend's license was taken to the manager.
,,,,,Ba-Ba-Reeba.... you rock!!!! This restaurant is spot on and we REALLY enjoyed it!!!! My girlfriend and I came here for supper on 01/01/18 for a New Years Day supper! Because let's be real... Tapas and Sangria is the perfect way to start the year off right. 
,,,,,"Okay... first this place gets BUSY... like really, really, really busy. With that being said, make sure you make reservations. We made ours through open table and it was a breeze. I think you can also make them through the restaurant website. There isn't a private parking lot, but there is limited parking on street (which we got) and there is Valet for $13. "
,,,,,"Now on to the fun stuff... the food here is just awesome. It's your classic Spanish tapas with some cool twists. We each got an glass of Sangria , Passion Fruit and Black Berry to start and it was awesome. Some of our favorite dishes were the goat cheese tomato sauce with bread, the cheese/spinach stuffed mushrooms, and the shrimp with garlic, oil, and red pepper flakes. These shrimp were REALLY REALLY good and I would get them again in a heart beat. We also tried a Moroccan Lamb dish with a mint cucumber salad and it was on point."
,,,,,The ambiance is really cool here. It's a very open restaurant with a nice bar area. The decor is great and the music is cool. Not too loud at all. 
,,,,,"I forgot our servers name, a little older with an accent, but he was a great server. Very polite, knowledgeable and fast. He knew the menu up and down and kept checking on us. "
,,,,,We were thrilled with our dining experience here and can't wait to check it out again.
,,,,,This is such a great spot for groups and the sangria is delish!!!
,,,,,"Finally got a chance to stop into the famous Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and I was impressed! The food was tasty and very reasonably priced, the wine was also inexpensive for the taste. I love how the menu is broken out by veggie options, seafood and meat, easy for me, a pescatarian to see what my options are without any grey area. Our server Ryan was super helpful and friendly as well. Also, I want to give a shout out to whoever makes the bread because it was delicious; fresh, warm, and soft. We will be back in the near future for our next Tapas fix."
,,,,,"Tasty but standard brunch spot. We started with $10 bloody marys from the bar. While this sounds like a great idea, I realized I have no idea what to put in (horseradish, onion spears, pickles, Tabasco etc available) so it was good but a little weird. The food was okay. We had some hits- the fried chicken bites and some misses- the Cubano. Everything was good and not a bad price, but it's not one of my favorite brunch spots I've been to. It is a lettuce restaurant so you get points for eating there!"
,,,,,"Gave my 76 year old mother and i ""window seats""  which is a joke.  Then bartender will ignore you for 20 minutes."
,,,,,"With over 3,000 reviews, there isn't much more for me to say that would be different from other reviews. "
,,,,,"I've been a few times and I really enjoy this place. The sangrias are awesome - I am a white wine fan, but love the classic red just as much. "
,,,,,"The service is great! Servers are quick to give recommendations of popular dishes. By being tapas style food, it's fun not to know what order your food will come out in. If you order paella, that will always be last because of how long it takes to cook."
,,,,,"I've had so many dishes here, but my favorites are:"
,,,,,Mushroom Soup
,,,,,Spicy Potatoes
,,,,,Burrata with Tomato Bread
,,,,,Bacon Wrapped Dates
,,,,,Seafood Paella
,,,,,This is one of my go to places when I have guests from out of town come to visit.
,,,,,"I was recommended this restaurant by a friend and I'm so glad I decided to go. The ambiance and food were amazing, and I loved the tapas style food. For drinks, we started out with a pitcher of the White Peach Sangria which was sweet and went a long way between the four of us. I also ordered the Rosemary's Niña, which wasn't my favorite but was decent. The tapas menu was expansive so we had to try a lot of items. The Warm Potato & Onion Omelette took a little longer to arrive since it takes a little longer to cook an omelette that thick, but it was okay. The Spicy Potatoes w/ Tomato Aioli were crispy and so flavorful; one of my favorite items. The Handmade Beef Empanada was fried to perfection. We had a few other plates with burrata, sausage, shrimp, beef, chicken, and they were all delicious. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food for four people, but once you start ordering you can't stop! I will say I thought our server kind of forgot about our table sometimes but the food made up for it, and I will be trying again."

,,,,,"On a Wednesday night at 21:00, a reservation luckily was not necessary.We were immediately seated on the left side of the restaurant that faces the patio, creating a very nice ambiance that embraces both casual diners and the sophisticated wine aficionados."
,,,,,"Alongside our glasses of red, we ordered three rounds of tapas:"
,,,,,- Patatas Bravas ($6.50) was divine! Loved the sauce they used over their home style potatoes.
,,,,,- Roasted Bacon Wrapped Dates ($7.50) were insanely yummy. Our plate came with seven pieces and it was a heavenly combination that you just need to try. Served over some small potato chunks.
,,,,,"- Octopus ($12) was a plate of tantalizing flavors. With tomatoes and chickpeas lining the sides, each bite of the grilled octopus became top notch."
,,,,,"For dessert, our Yelp check-in gave us two complimentary on the house. We went for the Banana and Ice Cream, as well as their Flan. Both dishes brought us down back to earth from a very tasty meal. Note that the banana is covered with nuts so be aware for those that have any nut allergies."
,,,,,Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was fantastic and hats off to such a great spot here in Chicago. I look forward to coming back here again to try more of their tapas.
,,,,,We were able to make a quick last minute brunch reservation. 
,,,,,"I started off with a peach sangria and I was not a fan of it. The sangria was watery and they added the lemon inside of the drink which I did not like. Also, I was unable to taste the peach. Honestly it seemed like something they just quickly put together."
,,,,,We ordered the Bacon Mac N'Cheese and I liked it. I expected smaller pieces of bacon to be within the Mac N'Cheese but it was two large pieces slapped on the top. 
,,,,,2024 N Halsted St
,,,,,The Buttermilk-fried Chicken Thighs were great! Another one of my favorites. I loved the sauce and it was the perfect amount. 
,,,,,"We also shared the Fried Calamari! This was my favorite dish and I would order it again in a heartbeat! Very, very delicious. "
,,,,,My boyfriend loved the Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli. They were just a bit too salty for my taste. 
,,,,,The Braised Short Rib was also one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes. It was okay. I probably would not order it again though.
,,,,,"The ambience was pretty cool. Our waitress was helpful. Overall, the tapas were okay. It was either a hit or miss for me."
,,,,,"I'm just a little bit obsessed with paellas, so as soon as I found out this tapas spot also offered brunch and that there was breakfast paella involved, I immediately added it to my list of places to eat at during my trip to Chicago."
,,,,,"It was very easy to make reservations, to my relief. I made my reservation for 3 a couple days in advance and the time slots were wide open. I'm not sure we needed reservations, as the space is very large (there are multiple seating areas) and there was plenty of seating when we got there a little after 10 am on Sunday. Even when we left, there was still plenty of seating open, though it was starting to fill up a little bit."
,,,,,"We ordered a breakfast paella to share for $24. This comes with rice, Spanish sausage, and scrambled egg crust and serves 2-3. Maybe if my friend and I had been hungrier, we could have finished it, but it was a pretty large portion and we probably managed to finish 2/3 of the dish between the two of us. I was a little bit disappointed by the flavor though, as the breakfast paella didn't have the flavor I typically associate with paellas (I think it's the saffron flavor?), and the sausage was super salty. I also wanted more egg in the paella; unless it blended in with the rice, I didn't actually see or taste too much of the egg. "
,,,,,"My other friend who's vegetarian ordered the veggie benefict, but he said that was disappointing as well, as the seasonal veggie that day was some kind of bean. He didn't like the combination of the beans with the poached egg and hollandaise sauce."
,,,,,"I really enjoyed the ambiance and decor, though. Despite the fact that it was 10 am and super bright outside, it was on the dimmer side inside the restaurant with strings of lights strung up in the ceiling so it felt very quaint and intimate despite the larger space. I can see this being a great date spot."
,,,,,"I would love to come back and try their other brunch items, or even at night for their tapas. If I'm ever back in Chicago again..."
,,,,,This place is amazing and the food was absolutely delicious!!! They are also very serious about keeping guests safe and even take your temperature when you enter and of course masks are required! I recommend 100%
,,,,,"When I'm Chicago there's two places I personally can recommend for authentic spanish tapas. One has drunken clams to live for, that'll always get you coming back for and the other is cafe babareeba might have spelled it incorrectly but the whimsical name will definitely get you to remember it when searching through random restaurant algorithms however you search for your own restaurants. It took me three or four times traveling to Chicago to finally be able to try this place out. And boy was I glad I had an opportunity. A fellow foodie friend asked what we should do to fill out our random trip with. I suggested Greek or Spanish tapas since goodness gracious who knows how long we'll be on the no fly list to Europe. I always attempt to scope out places that really attempt to transport you to a different city within the city you are visiting. Yes repeat visits won't be the same as your first one but we tried so many great dishes and random takes on dishes that most dishes were wonderful amongst the three musketeers. I'll post a few pics to hopefully get your appetite watering to attempt to try. If you found my review helpful, send a tip or pay it fwd. Help wonderful places like these stay part awesome. My only experiences in Spain are visits to places like Madrid and Barcelona each within their own city borders which have different dialects and cultural histories. Get to know your server and if time allows hear their stories from this great region in Europe. Tata for now... Have fun on your food adventures."
,,,,,"I have to say this place really deserves the rating they have on Yelp. During this whole situation with COVID they do have the systems in place to help people feel safe. Food was awesome! Our server Max was the best! He took the time to make us feel welcome and suggested some really good choices, since it was our first time. The Paella was really good! I recommend to try the grilled Octopus! I will be coming back. Thank you."
,,,,,"This place has a great happy hour deal with $1-2 tapas as well as pitchers of sangria. I would say that you get what you pay for here, and it's not a bad meal. But if you're looking for more quality than just a deal, this may not be for you. I enjoyed the Catalan tomato bread, patatas bravas, and Spanish omelet. The free bread was also delicious and freshly cut! The sangria wasn't very strong but had a decent flavor. "
,,,,,I definitely want to come back here to try the non-HH dishes as they all sounded delicious.
,,,,,I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while. It's very cute and busy on the inside but has a open atmosphere.
,,,,,"I mostly stuck with breakfast items. I liked the egg and potato small bite I had. The French toast stick bite and deviled egg were just ok. The Nutella waffle was good but I was pretty full by the time I got it (it came very late but the waitress apologized). I did not care for the chicken waffle stick, it was like a corn dog with chicken sausage, gross in my opinion! I checked in for a free dessert which I appreciate however my dessert was awful!!! It was passion fruit sorbet and it was soooo sour that it wasn't even edible and I'm not one to pass up dessert. I don't know how anyone could ever eat that, I think it was a poor choice by the restaurant. "
,,,,,I was really hoping that I would like cafe ba Ba Reba more Than I did especially because I'm from the suburbs and it took me an hour to get there. I'm hoping their dinner will be more impressive than their brunch. I do love the concept and I felt full and that their pricing was fair.
,,,,,"I've only been for happy hour but it is probably one of, if not my favorite, happy hours in the city! Came here with a group of six and we all loved their happy hour tapas and sangria. At $16 a pitcher, there was enough for about six glasses so one for each of us (what an awesome deal!). We went down the list and tried all of here happy hour tapas, which were all delicious."

,,,,,"This place hardly needs my review but for good measure, we'll post it anyway. I went to  Lincoln park high school down the street from this place and grew up always wondering what it was. Now that I'm a real life grown up, it took a friend from out  of town to convince me to go here and boy, I'm so glad I did. This is starting to turn into my own personal blog, so on to the food!"
,,,,,"I've been here twice now and I don't think it's possible for Cafe Ba Ba Reeba to disappoint. The place stays packed and there is often a least a small wait, and is worth it every time. "
,,,,,"My favorites are the goat cheese in tomato sauce, beef tenderloin with bleu cheese and the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms. "
,,,,,You can spend a pretty penny or two while dining here but it's really worth it (maybe go after pay day) to try all the different options.
,,,,,The restaurant is huge and the waiters have great insight and recommendations so make sure to utilize them if they aren't sure. My mouth is literally watering and I cannot wait to try their brunch!
,,,,,Probably the best tapas place in Chicago! Came here about 5 years ago for my Bachelorette party and just came back again for a date night - the quality was still the same as I remembered. Service was fast and friendly. Every dish had distinct flavor and texture. Try the appetizer platter (all 6-piece) and their jambalaya. You will not be disappointed!

,,,,,Looking for a place to be on a Tuesday night? This is it! 
,,,,,"So many great tapas style dishes to share, and so many vegetarian ones too!! I particularly enjoyed the Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce...because who doesn't love goat cheese? This was also the first place I've seen offer a vegetarian paella! "
,,,,,"They even have tapas sized desserts, which is the perfect to round out your meal since most people just need a few bites, and not an entire dish. I especially enjoyed the Marcona Almond-Carmel Bar. "
,,,,,"Big shout-out to our wonderful waitress, Maggie, for being the MVP of our outing. We ordered the paella, and it was bland for us. We asked her to bring some red chili flakes, but she came back with chili oil, and it brought the entire dish together!! Maggie was super friendly, very attentive, and was great at making recommendations based on our dietary needs. "
,,,,,"Definitely make a reservation prior to going. You can reserve a table for up to 4 people through OpenTable, but any more you'll need to call the restaurant. "
,,,,,"PS: For each person that checks in on Yelp, you get a free dessert!!"
,,,,,My daughter has taken me here before.  I love it! We order several different selections and share. The flavors have never disappointed.  The staff is always friendly and fast! I like the dark cozy ambiance.
,,,,,Delicious restaurant in Chicago. Decent prices for decent portions. Great Sangria choices. Mellow and relaxing ambience. They have a bar and a huge restaurant area. Good service. Friendly hostess and waiters. Food is delicious!!! Small bathrooms. Long lines to use stall.
,,,,,"This place is WAY overrated. The tapas are fine, but nowhere near as good as blackbull. I feel like people only like this place because they don't know what real Spanish food is."
,,,,,"To be fair, I have been to Spain multiple times and have very high standards for Spanish food -- which is nearly impossible to meet at most places in the US.  The food on it's own is fine. But if you are expecting authentic Spanish food, this place is not it."
,,,,,"Everything else was nice, the service, the drinks, the atmosphere, etc."
,,,,,"This place is SO YUMMY!!! Tapas style restaurant that specializes in paella. The menu here is diverse enough to find something for everyone and I have yet to have a dish that I didn't like. Some of my favorites are the dates, shaved Brussels sprouts, chicken thigh, and the potatoes bravas with tomato aioli. Fun place to get a bunch of different things and share with friends, and the sangria is good too! Love coming here when I visit Chicago. Oh also- they have breakfast tapas !"
,,,,,"The empanada was fresh, crispy, and meaty. The creamy garlic sauce (aioli?) it came with was just fantastic as well. While the garlic potato salad was great, my favorite were the patatas bravas, which were so crispy but fluffy inside, seasoned perfectly, and complimented  the garlic aioli so well. The seasoned chickpeas were tasty and filling, and the meatballs were so juicy and delicious, with a mild but tasty tomato sauce."
,,,,,"For $2-3, we were very pleased with the food and the super affordable sangria pitchers, and service was always prompt. I can't wait to come back for another happy hour or to try their full dinner menu!"

,,,,,"For brunch we ordered what seemed like the whole menu! Most of these dishes were actually from their lunch tapas rather than brunch menu. I will try to name a few but honestly everything was delicious! I particularly liked the deviled egg with bacon (they present it so beautifully! Check out my pic!) and roast dates with bacon. Other dishes that we tried and also liked were burrata with Catalan tomato bread (it could've used a little bit more salt I think but the texture of the cheese was great), spicy potatoes (comes with tomato alioli which is delicious), goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (good dish but i would've appreciated a hint of spice in it), and house charcuterie plate. "
,,,,,For drinks one of my friends tried the Bloody Mary bar which invokes making your own Bloody Mary. You order the alcohol you want then mix whatever you want in it. My friend didn't love his drink - thought his proportions for ingredients were off haha. Their sangrias are delicious!! One of my friends was able to get a mango sangria which was divine!
,,,,,Anddd the BEST part of the experience was the free dessert that you can get with Yelp check in! Most other places will just give you one item for the whole group for checking in but cafe ba ba reeba gave each one of us a free dessert! We were able to try their entire dessert menu by sharing!
,,,,,I loved my experience at cafe ba ba reeba. The atmosphere is so fun and vibrant! The place is bustling and full of energy. It's great for a group event because they do a great job of accommodating larger groups. At no point did our waiter seem

,,,,,Definitely will recommend to people around me & be back to try more things. 
,,,,,Our server was also very informative and friendly

,,,,,Ambiance here is excellent and it's such a fun place for a group.

,,,,,"It was SO hard to choose what to order. Those of you who are indecisive about food can empathize. My husband and I ended up splitting the fried green peppers, the beef empanada, the citrus-cured salmon, the garlic shrimp, and the fried calamari. We also checked in on Yelp and scored free desserts, the chocolate truffle cake and the butterscotch custard. Everything was delicious; I think our top favorites were the fried green peppers, the salmon, and the calamari. "
,,,,,I'm dying to go back just because their menu is so huge and I'm a sucker for tapas. Their drinks also looked spectacular. Hopefully those green peppers and I will be reunited soon.
,,,,,Came for restaurant week brunch and my favorite part was definitely the Bloody Mary bar! They gave a hefty pour of the vodka and allowed as many toppings as I wanted. Pro tip: think about what toppings you wAnt  before filling up the cup! I also suggest the gazpacho. 
,,,,,My favorite brunch item was definitely the bocadillo but the eggs Benedict was splendid as well. The service was quick and kind and I definitely plan on coming back.
,,,,,"For the most part, when I go out, I tend to focus on the positives of each experience. However, this one left me and the group feeling dejected and just overall very disappointed. I like to write reviews for places to help advocate for the business so that others will want to go try it and have the same wonderful experience as I have. When I visit places that are less than desirable, I typically don't leave reviews so that patrons will still want to go and maybe they'll have a better experience than I did. People and businesses can have ""off"" days and maybe that was just one of them so I want them to have the benefit of doubt. As my first ever 1-star review, you know that something went awry. "
,,,,,"We previously made reservations on Tock because we saw that they had a Flamenco Dinner Show. We made the reservations for 4 people and prepaid $60 or $66.90 with the 11.5% tax. Despite the chilly, subzero weather and the wintry mix that was going on, we still made the effort to go because we really wanted to see the show.  I had previously seen Flamenco dancers so I raved about it to my siblings and urged them do this together. Because of the snow and how slippery it was, we were about 10 minutes late. Our reservation was for 6 pm but got there around 6:10 pm.  Naturally, we checked in and gave our name with the hostesses (there were two) and the first hostess couldn't find our reservation. She asked the other hostess because she couldn't find us and the other hostess told her where to seat us. We go to the back room and sit while we waited for our sister and her baby. We ordered our food, got a pitcher of drinks, service was great and all was well while we waited for the show to start. Halfway through our meal, I got up to use the facilities and on my way back to our table, I noticed that the show was happening in the next room. When our server came by to check on us, we asked about the Flamenco show and showed her the Tock reservation. She got the manager and James came by to talk to us.  He said that we didn't check in, we were marked as a walk-in and that because we were considered a no-show, our table was already given to someone else. He proceeded to explain that there were two reservation systems so that's why ours was missed. He also said that Tock doesn't allow for refunds so he presented us with a $50 gift card for our troubles. Normally, our experience with Tock is that we prepay for our reservation and that amount is then credited towards our balance at the end of the meal. So when we got our bill and realized that this wasn't how it was, it just amplified my distaste for the entire experience. So no flamenco show, we were out $67 so a $50 gift card really seemed like a slap in the face. It made it seem like he didn't even bother to check the reservation and see that we paid for 4 people (we paid for the baby's seat) and he saw that there were 3 adults so we must have only paid for 3 people and that the extra $5 on the gift card was above and beyond. It was like kicking us while we were already down. I've been blessed to be able to go and experience various places and things aren't always the greatest but I've always looked for the positives. This experience left me with very little good to focus on and hold onto. The manager made it seem like it was our fault we were seated as a walk-in and we should've tried harder to make sure that we were seated where we were supposed to be. It had been years since I was there and a first time for my brother so we were inexperienced with how the shows worked and how checking in for reservations was supposed to occur. If you're thinking about going for a special event or using Tock for your reservations, I'd reconsider because if things don't go your way, the onus is on you and as the patron, it's your responsibility to know what you signed up for."
,,,,,Amazing place. Loved the food. Quite some vegetarian options. The staff was warm and pleasant.
,,,,,"came here for my bday brunch on a saturday! the dining room was very loud and crowded, but if you like lively atmospheres it'll be up your alley."
,,,,,some of us ordered the restaurant week menu and others did el la carte.
,,,,,the food was amazing and filling. got a red sangria which had a strong dry red wine background which i loved. for the courses I got the bacon mac and cheese and cubano sandwich. thee mac and cheese was creamy and bacon add a nicee saltiness. the cubano was savory with a nice sauce and delicious bread. it comes with potatoes that are flavored with some spices i also tried my friends' bacon wrapped dates and shrimp grits which were heavenly as well.
,,,,,"lastly, the dessert i ordered was almond caramel bar which tasted like a toffee bar. you get another dessert for checking in on yelp! so i got a butterscotch custard  which was delish. "
,,,,,overall good experience.  left with a nice food coma.
,,,,,Definitely coming again. The beef empanada and the pincho de solomillio was also very good. Oh and let's not forget dessert: truffle cake!

,,,,,"This is the perfect place to sample Spanish tapas. Everything comes in a smaller plate so it's recommended that you order at least two plates per person. The appetizers are individually sold so if you have a few people in your group, order more than 1."
,,,,,Service was good! The staff is attentive and came by constantly to ensure that we were doing okay. 
,,,,,The sangrias are good here and made with fresh fruit. 
,,,,,"There is plenty of seating within the restaurant including an outdoor patio, but it gets busy during dinner time so it's best to make a reservation beforehand to avoid the wait."
,,,,,Will definitely come again!
,,,,,"It's been years since I've been back. What a great experience. Delicious food and a very engaging staff. The place was hopping. We got seated and quickly had cocktails and the first of many courses started to arrive. Brussels Sprouts salad, cheese board, spicy garlic shrimp, roasted potatoes, chicken and sausage, roasted salmon and many more wonderful dishes. We finished with raspberry sorbet, chocolate cake, a salted caramel brownie and a butterscotch custard that was amazing. Loved every bit of it!"
,,,,,"This place lives up to the hype. It's been around for a long time, my parents used to go when they would visit Chicago! Tapas on tapas though. This place is great and So was the service. Don't think you're going to be able to split the bill though ;) "
,,,,,I got this delicious Brussels sprout salad with some fried chicken and the custard for desert. Absolutely delicious! Make a reservation!
,,,,,"Not really coming for the paella, but loving the tapas! Do yourself a favor and order the seared cana de cabra, this was out of this world, perfectly balanced flavorful! Plato de la casa and papas bravas are good to start it off. Manchego mushrooms are a MUST, even tho they are not selected as house favorites. Get them, no regrets. Not a sangria lover myself but I heard is really tasty. "
,,,,,"The sausage platter, yummy as well"
,,,,,"Ambiance is beautiful, reservation is always sugested"
,,,,,This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.
,,,,,"Great atmosphere, great food and great Sangria. "
,,,,,I highly recommend for bigger groups or even nice dinners.
,,,,,"I can't say enough about this place. Went with a group of six and started with Cava Sangria. It was light, refreshing, and not too sweet but was still strong. I tried a taste of my friend's peach sangria and that was far too sweet for me but still tasted nice. I also tasted the classic red sangria  which tasted like your typical solid red sangria. "
,,,,,"For food we tried a ton of tapas but I will touch on my favorites. My favorite tapa i tried that day was the goat cheese in tomato sauce. It comes with french bread with butter and herbs which perfectly complements the creaminess/sweetness of the cheese and tomato sauce. Next in line is the stuffed mushrooms. The flavor of the stuffing was creamy, salty, and crunchy---overall great appetizer. Rounding out my top three is the shrimp with olive oil and chili flake. There is nothing outwardly unique about this, but the flavor and the jumbo shrimp make this a GREAT option to appease anyone. We also ordered two types of Paella for the table: the seafood one and the meat one. Both were great, the meat was tender was flavorful, but overall this paella was a bit drier than the seafood. The seafood paella was moist and packed full of the most delicious seafood!  For dessert we got the carmelized apple which was light and refreshing and the pistachios on top added the perfect crunch! I look forwards to trying many more tapas in the near future because this might just be my new spot!"
,,,,,"My favorite place to eat in Chicago hands down! It's hard to go there and not get at least three orders of the bacon wrapped dates. So many other great options to choose from as well. Just make sure to book your reservation well in advance if you're going on a weekend, because they fill up fast!"
,,,,,"Set your weekend alarms; you won't want to miss this brunch place. Reservations accepted and highly encouraged. The place filled up by 10:00am. Tapas, tapas, TAPAS!"
,,,,,"The outside looks smaller than the inside. As we walked in, I saw a full make your own Bloody Mary bar, complete with crisp bacon and cheese skewers. Bottles of hot sauce and Bloody Mary mix accompanied the ensemble. The host greeted us and took us to our table."
,,,,,"Packed front of house, but still enough room to move about and be comfortable. We were seated next to an antique wall mirror. The inside has a rustic and warm feeling. "
,,,,,"Large brunch menu. This place has some of the best Spanish tapas in Chicago. We ordered the Waffle-Battered Chicken Stick, Deviled Egg, Citrus French Toast Stick, Shrimp and Grits, Potato and Egg Bite, and Ham Benedict. Portions are tapas (bite sized), and best enjoyed with a group or partner!! A lot of savory and mouth watering flavors! Amazing sangria, too!!"
,,,,,"I am counting down the days when I can come here again!! The service is about as awesome as the food. I look forward to trying the dinner menu, and adding another star to this almost perfect rating!"
,,,,,MY MOST FAVORITE RESTAURANT FOR LARGE GROUPS!! Such a fun place to go on a Friday/Saturday night. 
,,,,,1) PEACH SANGRIAS ARE BOMB
,,,,,"2) Start with a paella, because they take a while to cook. My favorite is the seafood. "
,,,,,"3) Order the crispy potatoes and bacon-wrapped dates. Just do it. Everything here is good, but you can't miss those 2. REALLY REALLY INCREDIBLE. Cannot emphasize enough. "
,,,,,"4) Oh yeah, and don't forget to order more sangria. "
,,,,,"5) Last time we went, our waiter brought us 3 complimentary desserts to try (thank you!!). The chocolate truffle cake was our favorite... really decadent and melted in your mouth. Will definitely order it next time. "
,,,,,GO TO BABAREEBA FOR YOUR NEXT EVENT... you won't regret it!
,,,,,"Come Here for a Lively, Fun Night in a Boistrous Environment, Surrounded by Great Food."
,,,,,"This is the toughest review I have written yet because the night was a blur. Ba Ba Reeba is a tapas joint and we just kept ordering small plate after small plate, pitcher of sangria after pitcher of sangria. I tried to keep up with pictures, but during a meal--a really good meal with fun people--you just have to let go and just be in the moment. I missed a couple dishes and I can't remember them, but know that they were delicious. You can create a meal with a variety of tapas, or choose a selection as an appetizer and enjoy one of their paellas as your main course."
,,,,,"We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Catalan Tomato Bread ($11); the bread was toasted crisp and paired with the cheese and sauce well. The Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli ($7.50) is a definite crowd pleaser with its tangy aioli and crispy-on-the-outside potato cubes and fluffy innards. The six of us had to arm wrestle for the three Bacalao Croquettes with Sherry Aioli ($2.50), but halved them and ordered more; this plate had a lot of flavor and good spice. Ba Ba Reeba's infamous ""Paella de Mariscos"" with Shrimp, Squid, Preserved Mussels & Fennel ($17) was spectacular--true paella, cooked perfectly; you have to order it first, because it takes a while to make and then magically appears. Their Rioja-Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Seasonal Vegetables & Rioja Wine Glaze ($14) was a show stopper; so tender and delicious, we tore into it before I could snap a picture. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes ($9.50) was a solid plate with fresh, firm shrimp. My favorite plate was the Seared Scallops with Red Kuri Squash Purée, Maple Vinaigrette and Candied Pumpkin Seeds ($14); I would have ordered ten of these plates and been a happy man."
,,,,,"My advice would be to make sure you leave room for dessert, which is hard to do because they have such a large, delicious offering of entree plates, you don't want to stop. But stop, trust me. We ordered the Caramelized Banana ($3.50), with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios; a great option to end a meal with a sweet, yet not-too-rich dessert. The Chocolate Truffle Cake ($3.50), with kahlua, whipped cream was rich and decadent--make sure your belly is ready for this delicous cake. Saving the best for last again was the Marcona Almond-Caramel Bar ($3.50) with whpped cream and a butter crust--YUM. This too was rich, so beware."
,,,,,"This is a great place for couples, large groups, families, everything. You can order lots of small plates for every palette and picky eater. My only recommendation to Ba Ba Reeba is to get bigger tables--we had so many small plates, it was a glorious mess."

,,,,,The food was tasty and served quickly. The server did little to make us feel welcomed. I expected to have plenty of social distancing in their indoor/outdoor patio area and tables may have been at least six feet apart but it was very full and it made me so concerned that I did not have a pleasant experience. It didn't feel like air was circulating very well and large tables had so many people that it made it too noisy to have any kind of conversation--which also say something about the distance between tables. This was my first visit to this restaurant and likely to be my last.
,,,,,"The restaurant has an area that is dimly lit and intimate, but also a room with open windows, and a frosted glass roof that allows in a beautiful amount of natural sunlight. We were originally seated in the dark, but our initial waiter was gracious enough to move us over to the brighter area. "
,,,,,"Between my friend and I we shared the paella (minimum serving is for 2) and a few tapas (small bites). Our second waiter didn't seem to know the menu very well. We asked for recommendations because there were so many tasty options, but he seemed to read over my shoulder to recommend the dishes already highlighted in red on the menu. "
,,,,,"-Paella with confit pork shoulder, crispy pork belly, chorizo, and chicharrones"
,,,,,"The description sounded bomb. The reality featured a dry yet oily, under-spiced rice with really dry meat. It was just very, very far from my idea of a moist, pleasant paella."
,,,,,-Grilled Octopus
,,,,,"The flavors of this confused me. I felt like the greens on the plate were frivolous. They did not enhance the octopus, and their texture didn't work well make one cohesive bite. The octopus on the other hand was cooked very well, but the flavors were subtle and a rather unidentifiable. The concept for the dish has so much potential, but the execution of it was too all scattered to be enjoyable. "
,,,,,-Short rib
,,,,,"If I had to relate this to something in terms of flavor, this reminded me a bit of the taste of a canned beef stew. It was tender and flavorful though."
,,,,,-Grilled Hanger Steak
,,,,,The highlight of this one were the mushrooms. There were seasoned so well and had great texture. I could have eaten a bowl of just these mushrooms. The steak was also delicious. 
,,,,,-Buttermilk fried Chicken
,,,,,"The sauce is a bit like a buffalo hot sauce, but more subtle. I'm not a huge fan of buffalo sauce, I find it to be a bit too acidic. The chicken was cooked very well though. Given my bias, it was just A-OK. "
,,,,,"The inconsistencies in the meal kept me from giving Café Ba-ba-reeba a higher rating, and although I had a lot of constructive criticism of the tapas, the tapas were tasty and deserving of 4 stars. Each one had great flavors that did not require any additional seasoning, even if those flavors were not to my preference. I would recommend it for a casual place for some small bites. Another con is that it is very easy to rack up a big bill here even though the smaller portions are expected."
,,,,,"The food here is terrible, the drinks are okay. This place is all about the HYPE if you want real tapas go to Valencia or any other spot. This place has the most bland food I've ever tasted. Everything was prepared fairly quick and tasted revolting."
,,,,,This review is for happy hour only! I will update when I go back for a whole meal. 
,,,,,"The happy hour is a good deal, $16 sangria pitchers and a bunch of small plates for cheap. We just stopped in for a quick drink but for a Friday afternoon the bar area had open seating available immediately. While brief, I enjoyed my experience there and hope to be back and try much much more!"
,,,,,Our server Kay was great .
,,,,,Food amazing.Once I tried I was speechless I had a log day a work and after I tried the food my mood changed . 
,,,,,Las patatas bravas tested delicious like the one that I tried in Spain lol
,,,,,Great place . Great vibes .
,,,,,Definitely coming back .
,,,,,Hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Ba Ba is so good my wife and I had our wedding rehearsal here on Aug 3 2018. 
,,,,,"The menu is of course tapas style and everything can be shared / ordered whenever during the meal. You must order the bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, sangria, and the short rib. Pricing is very generous considering the service and excellent food. Book well ahead to get a table. "
,,,,,-Yale Reardon
,,,,,"My go-to recommendation when folks ask where to eat in Lincoln Park. Everything is delicious, and the tapas style is so fun for groups! You get to try so many different things that way, and the menu has so many unique dishes to try out that you could go every day and have something new. Big fan!"
,,,,,"We had our rehearsal dinner here 3 years ago and have now made it a tradition to return each year for our anniversary. Each time the food, service and sangria are great. Bacon wrapped dates and the red wine sangria is the perfect combination."
,,,,,I love restaurants that spell out their name phonetically. 
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba (said as it's spelled) is a long time staple with consistently good food and service. They've got options for vegetarians, pescetarians, gluten frees, carnivores, omnivores, and liquid dieters."
,,,,,"I've always found the ambiance to be like a loud, happy, loving family dinner. It's always crowded on the weekends, but it's not so crowded that it's hard to have a good time. It's great for shindigs with friends or big family get-togethers. "
,,,,,"Everything on the menu is great, but if you have some time and you're feeling spicy, order the paella. It goes great with a couple of jugs of homemade sangria for a night you'll always remember (or completely forget depending on how hard you go.)"
,,,,,One of my favorite restaurants to enjoy some delicious tapas or paella. A group of us came in yesterday & enjoyed our time. Our server had a few mishaps but he was so friendly & attentive it didn't bother us. I was looking over our receipt & noticed we were charged for the plate that our server accidentally brought out. This has happened to me twice now at ba ba reeba...I partially blame myself & the sangria for not double checking the bill.

,,,,,Best tapas place I've been to in the city! I highly suggest making a reservation here because it was insanely packed when I went on a Wednesday evening. Even with reservations my friend and I were placed in a tight corner with other tables right next to us. The atmosphere is dark and cozy but so lively inside. The menu is huge and has something for everyone!! I wanted to try almost everything but obviously had to limit myself. I'll list the items we tried:
,,,,,Off the Pinxtos menu:
,,,,,Chorizo wrapped dates- OMG. SO. GOOD. An amazing combination of spicy and sweet.
,,,,,Bacalao croquette (Salt Cod fritter): A delicious fried bite. Perfect little fish fritter with a creamy sauce to go with it. 
,,,,,"Seared Cana de Cabra (Seared soft cheese with onion jam & honey): I love the combination of a soft cheese with any type of jam, preserve or honey so this was a great small bite on toast."
,,,,,Regular Menu: 
,,,,,Scallops- Perfectly cooked and seasoned so well. The corn relish that surrounds them is really flavorful.
,,,,,"Chicken empanada- Hands down my favorite dish of the night. Buttery, flaky crust with tasty filling. The sauce it comes with is to die for as well. I would've ordered 5 more of these if we didn't want to try a variety of items. This, or their other empanadas are a must. "
,,,,,"Shrimp: Again, another seafood dish cooked to perfection and had an awesome heat to it. I believe this is one of their specialty dishes & I can see why."
,,,,,Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli: Definitely the most filling dish! We could not finish these but they were crispy & lived up to the spicy description.
,,,,,Citrus cured salmon: My friend actually thought this dish was too citrusy. I disagree but it wasn't my favorite dish either. The crema is really bland and the salmon was just okay. 
,,,,,"Last but not least - the chocolate cake: I could use one word and just say, amazing. But honestly, it was really really good. So rich but not too much. "
,,,,,"Loved the experience here and loved the food even more. Tapas is the funnest way to dine, in my opinion. And This place did not disappoint. I cant wait to come back in the future!"
,,,,,"I can't complain about the flavors because the food tasted good, but the portions are a joke, very small, nothing to do with the photos.  I feel it was little of waist of money."
,,,,,"Had the most fun family dinner here! Lively (though cramped) atmosphere, so you will have a good time.  We loved the sangria.  For food, our party of 4 shared a variety of small plates.  They also serve divine table bread to nosh on while waiting for your next dish.  I love this place because you can get a variety of dishes so that everyone is happy.  Be prepared to share !"
,,,,,"I want to love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba so badly! The concept is cool, but the reality of it is just okay."
,,,,,"Tapas are great, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has lots of different tapas. Unfortunately, they're kind of hit-or-miss. The ""spicy potatoes"" (patatas bravas) are really good -- they definitely remind me of Spain! But the short rib is like a weird, mini-sized beef dinner. And this wouldn't be a Spanish restaurant without paella. There's a minimum of two portions, and they're each HUGE portions. Two portions could easily feed four without any tapas on the side. The paella definitely has a smoky flavor to it, but the first time I was here, it was straight up burnt. Again, kind of hit-or-miss."
,,,,,"Bonus points for having a gluten free menu! But with the tapas style, it's easy to over order at this place. Each time I've been here, it's at least $30 per person, and despite the fun cultural aspect, I leave thinking there's just better out there for the money."
,,,,,"Stellar. This place has been around for YEARS! I mean, last time I was here was 10+ years ago. Probably before yelp and social media. Sangria options galore. I had a black raspberry one. Once my"
,,,,,"Friend arrived, we ordered so Much. Octopus, Gambas, patatas, skewers, sprouts salad, I can't even remember it all! I was so deep in conversation but he (server) just kept bringing our plates one at a time. The vibe is so great! Tons of tables, good lighting. It was packed and it was just a Monday night. I will be back sooner this time."
,,,,,I lovvvvvve Cafe Ba-Ba-Reba.
,,,,,This is a be sure to have a reservation or be prepared to wait a while type place. It's super easy to make a reservation online so just make sure to be prepared for that. Also if you have a larger group be sure to give extra time to place a reservation. For 2-4 you can get in same day fairly easy but you may still have to wait a little. 
,,,,,I've been for lunch and brunch so my review is specifically for those time slots. Also important to note that the food is soooo consistantly good! I've been there with a variety of sized groups too. 
,,,,,The food is tapas style so it's all shareable plates and it's so much fun to do it that way! You get a bite or two of whatever you order and then If you still want more just order another plate. 
,,,,,I think the lunch plates are my favorite - the short ribs are possibly the best thing on the menu. They melt in your mouth and are soooo good. The mushrooms go really well with this dish so I recommend ordering those to go along with it. 
,,,,,The brunch plates are good with the Cubano (ask for the homemade sauce to go on the side) and French toast being my favorites. 
,,,,,As far as drinks go there's something for everyone. The build your own Bloody Mary bar is superb and the house made tomato juice is really tasty. The sangria is out of this world so if that's your style then I recommend ordering a pitcher to share. 
,,,,,"if you've ever wondered - wow, everyone keeps talking about that Cafe Ba-ba-reba place - there's a reason!"
,,,,,Is there anything better than tapas and Sangria? The answer is no.
,,,,,Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a staple in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and there is a reason why many guests have been over and over again.
,,,,,I've only been for the lunch menu but it is fantastic. 
,,,,,My second visit to the Cafe was the best. Each course came out in perfect time so we always had something to share. Every bite was perfect too and they all went together really well. 
,,,,,The service was fantastic! The sangria is always amazing too!
,,,,,I highly recommend going to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. Be sure to make a reservation in advance - they book up quick!
,,,,,"I can say without question, this is one of the best meals I've ever had, and my date agreed."
,,,,,A few TIPS before I dive into the specifics:
,,,,,- Get a reservation as soon as you know you want to go here
,,,,,- Get twice as many chorizo-wrapped dates as you think you'll want
,,,,,- Use the brussel sprout salad as a palate cleanser in between courses
,,,,,- Get the scallops even if you don't like scallops (I normally hate them)
,,,,,"- Skip the shrimp. Out of 9 dishes I tried, it was the only one that fell short, and there is too much other good food here to bother with these."
,,,,,"So I came here on a Friday night at 930PM with my partner, and the place was slammed (90 min wait). Luckily I had made reservations prior."
,,,,,"Upon getting our first course, it became very evident what all the fuss was about..."
,,,,,"The chorizo-wrapped dates were astonishing, with chorizo that ate far more like salami than anything I'd had before, and that had a far milder, less greasy, all-around better flavor than what I was used to. It perfectly complemented the cheese and the date that it held."
,,,,,"The grilled Iberico pork had a perfect char on the outside, and was as tender and juicy as any steak I've had. The red chimichurri that came with it was vibrant and herbaceous, but also creamy, lightly smokey, and layered with deeper flavors."
,,,,,"The fried chicken thigh was also excellent, with a crunchy yet fairly light breading that was smothered in a delicious sweet/spicy/vinegar-y sauce that gave way to juicy, flavorful meat."
,,,,,"Following that, the short rib came, and the Manchego mashed potatoes that accompanied it were among the best I've had. So rich and buttery. The short rib was quite tender and delicious, with a strong beefy flavor."
,,,,,"The scallops and shrimp were next. The shrimp were the one disappointing item on the menu, not really having a lot of flavor or packing anything special. The scallops, meanwhile, were cooked to perfection, with a nice sear on the outside, and a delicate, buttery texture that fell apart easily. They were perfect alongside the thick, salty, chowder-y sauce that came with."
,,,,,"The house meat plate was as sensational as expected (Serrano ham...), and the chicken empanada was very light and flaky, with a nicely flavored shredded filling."
,,,,,"Our brussel sprout salad was actually the first thing that came out, but the last thing we finished as we hopped back and forth between it and the more substantial dishes that came after. It was light and simple, making it the perfect thing to reset the palate in between courses."
,,,,,"This is definitely a place I will strive to come back to, as there was just too much amazing food that I want to eat again, and too wide of a menu for me to not strongly wonder about the amazing things we didn't get to try."
,,,,,"Came here for a brunch in the private room. So we had a tasting menu and dedicated waiters. I arrived a little later than my party, but the waiter noticed right away, took my drink order and brought me a little plate of what I missed. I was so busy scarfing the food down I didn't get pictures of the first few courses! My favorite was the French toast -- AMAZING. The brioche bread was perfect, and it was a good mix of fluffy and crunchy. I'm also usually not a huge fan of eggs Benedict, but the one here was yummy and had the right balance of ingredients."
,,,,,"Great service, and the food was delicious!!!"

,,,,,Got the white peach sangria to drink. Brussel sprout salad was so good we got another one. Also really enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and octopus.
,,,,,Always amazing and great to be back there in such a long time. Food was even better than I remembered (if that's even possible) and the service was 100!
,,,,,"Mmmm tapas~ this was the best spot to grab Sunday dinner with a friend to catch up. They had a phenomenal menu - pintxos to start with, a wide range of tapas, and of course paella!"
,,,,,"The pintxos were amazing - we didn't get all of them but the favorite was definitely the cabra (soft cheese with honey on crispy bread) and the chorizo wrapped date. I was expecting the chorizo wrapped date to be super sweet, but it was the perfect amount of sweet. The cabra is just so amazing - the cheese is super soft and slightly sweet and savory and I could've probably had a whole plate of it. "
,,,,,"Surprisingly I was way more impressed with the pintxos than I was with the tapas - the tapas was good too but just not as good as the pintxos. None of the tapas that we got (Brussels sprouts, cheese board, and the octopus) stood out to me really."
,,,,,"This place was the real deal. Multiple sangria options, tons of tapas to choose from, and a wonderful warm and cozy vibe, despite the fact that it's quite a large restaurant. "
,,,,,"My friend made a reservation, which she said is a must do since this place is really popular. And it was packed when we were there, so heed my friend's advice. "
,,,,,We went with a pitcher of the passion fruit sangria and it was so good! A perfect amount for two people--it ends up being about 3 glasses per person. 
,,,,,"We started with the bacon wrapped dates--delicious melt in your mouth salty sweet perfection! We also got the spicy potato wedges. Very good--loved the creamy sauce that accompanied them. We followed that up with the scallops, which our server said was one of his favorites. They were excellent. And finally we got the Brussels sprouts, which was basically a salad. Also good! "
,,,,,"If you check in on yelp, you get a free dessert! I went with the butterscotch caramel and omg, it was amazing! Highly recommend. "
,,,,,I really appreciated how our server let us take our time so we could really enjoy our food and drink and not feel like we were being rushed. 
,,,,,If you're in the area definitely try to check this place out if you can!
,,,,,I consider this place to be the best tapas restaurant in Chicago!
,,,,,"I went here for the first time for dinner with friends on my birthday back in February. It was a classic, windy, rainy, Chicago-weather type of day, and the restaurant was a welcome escape from that. "
,,,,,This is an ideal place to order a handful of small dishes and share them with the table. One of the things I remember ordering was the empanadas and they were awesome. For a drink I got the peach sangria was so delicious! 
,,,,,The place was very busy on a Saturday night and there were a handful of groups waiting to be seated. We had a reservation though and we were seated almost immediately. 
,,,,,On one side of the restaurant there's a dining area and on the other is a large bar. We were of course in the dining area and it wasn't terribly loud. 
,,,,,I definitely plan on returning here again in the future!
,,,,,"This is a very unique place. It's a Spanish tapas restaurant, meaning you have to order quite a few small dishes that you usually share amongst the table. As a party of 5, we ordered a lot of food and everything was delicious. All the food comes out as it is prepared, not all at once like a standard restaurant. "
,,,,,"The pallellas are very good as well, but these take about 30 minutes to prepare. The atmosphere is cool, and the place is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. "
,,,,,"Overall, I really enjoyed this meal, though it is slightly on the pricier side for small plates. I would go back."
,,,,,"I'm such a huge fan of Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!! I made a lunchtime reservation a few days in advance. The restaurant seems small from outside, but it actually extends super far into the back. I loved the natural lighting in the main dining room! My waitress was super sweet - I wish I had gotten her name. She offered great recommendations and checked up on me a few times. I got handed a huge basket of delicious warm sourdough bread and couldn't stop eating it haha"
,,,,,Starting with my favorite dishes -
,,,,,"Spanish-Style Garlic Shrimp (Gambas al Ajillo) - I loved this dish in Spain, so I knew I had to try it here.A small dish with 6 shrimp sauteed in lots of garlic and chili flakes. I ate it with the complimentary bread and it was a flavor explosion! Amazing."
,,,,,"Grilled Octopus - Tender pieces of octopus served with green salad, chickpea purée & pimentón vinaigrette. I wouldn't have thought this flavor combo would work, but it was delicious as well."
,,,,,"Chorizo-Wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese - I already knew I would love this, but I wasn't prepared for how big of a date it was lol. Or maybe I've only eaten small dates before? The saltiness of the chorizo perfectly complemented the sweetness of the date and tanginess of cheese."
,,,,,"Seared Cana de Cabra with onion jam & membrillo honey - A thick crostini topped with a large smear of creamy goat cheese, onion jam, and honey. The flavors worked well together too."
,,,,,"The only dish I wouldn't order again was the Buttermilk-Fried Chicken Thighs with piri-piri sauce & shaved vegetable salad. This tasted just like buffalo chicken, nothing special."
,,,,,"For the Yelp Check-in for a free dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Caramel Almond Bar, which tasted like a Twix! Super sweet though."
,,,,,"It's so rare that I can like 4 out of the 5 dishes I order at a Tapas restaurant. Wish I came with more people so we could try more dishes, especially the Paella and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce (omg)."
,,,,,One of my top 3 restaurants in Chicago! Love how I can try a variety of delicious dishes without breaking the bank!
,,,,,"We were looking for a last minute place to brunch and many of the common go-to spots were booked for reservations. Ba-Ba-Reeba had openings for us so we tried it out. We sat in the patio and it was absolutely beautiful with the indirect sunshine coming through.The Bloody Mary bar was totally worth it - the spread of add-ins was unbeatable! We ordered from the brunch and regular menu of tapas. My favorites were the grilled octopus, citrus cured salmon, and the brunch menu paella (photo attached). The bread service was top quality. I'm definitely coming back to try the other tapas options. One thing I wish was different - I wish the food came out all at the same time. "
,,,,,"If you check in on yelp, you get a free dessert tapa. PER PERSON!"
,,,,,It was absolutely delicious and our waiter was so sweet! I loved every single tapa I got and we had like 9!
,,,,,Bacon Wrapped Dates
,,,,,Beef Empanada
,,,,,Chicken Thighs
,,,,,Fried Calamari
,,,,,Patatas Bravas
,,,,,Piri-piri Fried Chicken Thighs
,,,,,Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli
,,,,,"After recently coming home from a trip to Spain, this tapas bar really met my expectations!"
,,,,,"I arrived on a Saturday night with a couple friends, the staff were very friendly when they informed us it would be around a 2.5hr wait for the 4 of us, or we could keep a close eye on the bar seating and snatch up a table when one became available. We opted for the later and had found a table within 15 minutes!"
,,,,,"Our server was very helpful, he offered us some suggestions to help us narrow down our choices from the HUGE menu (~70 different tapas choices). We decided to go with the stuffed mushrooms, spanish sausage plate, fried chicken thighs with peri-peri, hanger steak, and the garlic shrimp. Everything came out quickly after we ordered, so if you're looking for a slower paced meal, I would recommend ordering as you go. Oh! We also got the seasonal sangria (a pitcher, about 6 glasses, was $30 versus $10 per glass normally) which was a spiced apple and white wine version - delish and perfect for fall! Anyways, the food was all very tasty and reasonably sized portions for the price - perfect for splitting between 3-4 people. Our favorites were the hanger steak and the spanish sausages."
,,,,,"We also shared some paella! Note: order this at the beginning of your meal/when you know you want it because it takes about 20 minutes to happen. We opted for 2 portions of the paella mixta which had sausage and chicken thighs in it (they have a 2 portion minimum for paella). It was definitely enough food for 4 people after 5 shared tapas. It was enough for a small plate each, but the highlight was them mixing it at the table! The rice was well seasoned, but I like a bit more stuff-to-rice than I got (too much rice, not enough stuff). We finished our meal with a couple espressos for the boys, and my friend and I split a small dessert (free with yelp check-in!!!). We had the blueberry compote and goat milk ice cream which was a nice light way to finish off the meal."
,,,,,Overall this was a great meal though and a wonderful place to meet up with friends!

,,,,,100% go here- right this second! Super fun atmosphere and DELECTABLE food! The staff is all wonderful from their wait staff to their bus staff! We had a 11 mo old and the staff all treated her so nicely and were so helpful! The food is so different- I would suggest just getting a bunch of different things and sharing with the table! Such a fun culinary experience- can't wait to go back!
,,,,,Went for date night with my boyfriend who I met in SPAIN!!!! It was so yummy and a nice Covid experience. We got a pitcher of passion fruit sangria- super yummy and fruity!
,,,,,"For food we got the papas bravas, super tasty BUT much better on Barcelona ;) still danky dank!"
,,,,,We also had the green peppers that were super salty but not toooo salty! It was a big portion and would recommend!
,,,,,Next we got the burrata avocado which was yummmmyyy you can't go wrong but we definitely didn't need it with everything else. Big portion for 2!
,,,,,Lastly... the chicken paella!!!! Soooo good and tasty the chicken was awesome and the flavor was rich!!! Even ate leftovers it cold and it was still soooo good!!!
,,,,,Great night overall but nothing beats tapas in Barcelona!!
,,,,,Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! is perfect for special occasions. Prepare to spend a lot of money here because it's hard not to try everything on the menu and share with good company. And it's hard not to try the paellas (which serves 4). And it's hard not to order a pitcher (or three) the white peach sangria. The Bloody Mary bar is rad. The quality here is worth every penny.
,,,,,"Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is an iconic restaurant that is heavily recommended for people looking for a taste of Chicago tapas. I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of tapas (paying lots of money for small portions) because I'm a hungry girl and I particularly don't like it in large groups because it gets a bit hectic, but that won't taint the review of the restaurant itself."
,,,,,We went with a group of co-workers and they were very accomdating with the seating even when we had less people than the original reservation. 
,,,,,"We started off with the white sangria, it was good but didn't taste like there was much alcohol. "
,,,,,We put in an order for paella was good and very filling with two servings for 6 people.. It takes a while to come out so order first.
,,,,,We ordered a bunch of tapas... Some were unmemorable. The grilled hanger was good and the grilled calimari. I thought the Pata Negra was ridiculously overpriced at $20. The tapas all come out fast so dont order too much at the beginning and just order as you need it. 
,,,,,Loved the free yelp check in for a dessert. We got the chocolate cake one which was very rich and yummy.
,,,,,"All in all, I come here on rare occasions but I'd be back... with a smaller group."
,,,,,Ba-Ba-Reeba!
,,,,,Even the name is fun!   
,,,,,"We've dined at this Lincoln Park institution numerous times over the years, and have always enjoyed the experience.  Our most recent visit came on the heels​ of my daughter's college tour of DePaul.  It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. Come to think of it, every time I've been here its been busy.  We were seated right away, but by the time we left there appeared to be a slight wait. "
,,,,,"We typically come later in the day.  This was our first time here for brunch.  Everything was delicious, but two items were especially noteworthy: #91 Potato Egg Bites, and #82 Beef Tenderloin Benedict. "
,,,,,Service was flawless.  Prices are reasonable. 
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a large, loud, fun place to eat.  I can't wait for my next visit!"
,,,,,Can't go wrong bringing anybody here because there's bound to be something on the menu for everyone. Try different plates and share! 
,,,,,"The sangria is also great and really tasty. Pro tip: It's a great date spot--if the date's going well, you can keep ordering. If it's going poorly, you can end the meal at any time."
,,,,,Great variety of tapas and a fun atmosphere. The paella is definitely worth a try and it's consistently one of our favorites
,,,,,"I was visiting Chicago for the 4th of July weekend. My best friend recommended this spot and I'm so glad that she did! I made a reservation for Friday at 12pm, and we were quickly seated outside in the air conditioned enclosed-patio. It's such a low-key/unpretentious/cute date spot!"
,,,,,I recommend the following dishes:
,,,,,-- Seared Cana de Cabra with Onion Jam & Membrillo Honey
,,,,,-- Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce
,,,,,"-- Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes** a must! "
,,,,,-- Lamb Chops with English Peas & Mint Oil
,,,,,I didn't care too much for:
,,,,,-- Grilled Octopus
,,,,,-- Bacalao Croquette with Sherry Aioli
,,,,,-- Handmade Beef Empanada: I didn't like the sauce that came with it
,,,,,-- Grilled Hanger Steak: cooked perfectly but kind of plain
,,,,,Don't forget to order sangria! Highly recommend the mango one.
,,,,,"Absolutely everything we tried (which was a lot) was phenomenal. Never had tapas before and I think this might be one of the top restaurants I've ever been too. Everything from the food, atmosphere, and service was excellent. You HAVE to try the dates!"
,,,,,"Always the best!!! I miss some of the original tapas, tuna cannelloni, blackened rabbit legs with sherry mayonnaise, thin sliced roasted veal but I always manage to find plenty of delicious foods to eat!"

We got the patatas bravas with the spicy dipping sauce, the brussel sprout salad, the braised short rib, and two free desserts with yelp check in - the flan and the chocolate dessert. We also got the mango sangria which was tasty."
,,,,,This is hands down my favorite tapas restaurant in Chicago. 
,,,,,I have been here a few times (for many different specials occasions) and I still love Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! Anytime that I have visited the restaurant I have never left disappointed and not full with delicious food. 
,,,,,I would strongly recommend making a reservation no matter what your party size is because it expedites the time you have to wait. I have come here with a party of three and ended up sitting at the back bar because the wait to seat at a table was much longer than we wanted to wait. I still enjoyed myself nonetheless! 
,,,,,The inside of the restuarant is massive and it is always packed. You can literally come solo or with a large group of people (call minimum a week in advance if you want a larger than average group). The vibe inside the restaurant is very sexy so it is a great place for a date night or a night out with your friends. It is kind of loud though. 
,,,,,The price of food will quickly add up if you don't pay attention to how many dishes you have ordered. The serving sizes are the typical tapas sizes but you can easily get full without spending a ton if you think strategically when you order. 
,,,,,"My favorite dish is the buttermilk fried chicken, I always introduce new people to the dish because it never disappoints. It is nicely crispy and just saucy enough with a side sauce that makes you want to eat every dish with it. The dish is also highly recommended by the restaurant and reasonably priced. "
,,,,,"This is a must visit place, I have loved every time that I have visited Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!"
,,,,,Came here on a Friday evening for a happy hour drink. The front bar was packed so somebody directed us to the bar in the back. It was about 10 minutes before the back bar opened (530) but we were glad to have a seat. 
,,,,,We ordered the happy hour sangria pitcher (16 dollars) and several of the tapas. The bacon wrapped dates were AMAZING!  Other items were good as well but get the dates. We also had a dessert tapa which is how all desserts should be served.  Also saw you can get a free dessert tapa for checking in on yelp which I didn't see but definitely will next time!
,,,,,"With the pitcher, 4 tapas plus the dessert tapa (and free bread) our total with tip was around 40 dollars which is a great happy hour value in an amazing building. Can't wait to return"
,,,,,This is a great place!!! One of my favourite places for sure... ambience is great and love the sangria there menu has a lot of vegetarian options which is great and very well priced!! A must go
,,,,,"We have been faithful customers since the 90s! A little disappointed with our last visit. They have taken off several staples from the menu-chicken salad, carmelized bananas and bread for the table! They are packed and it's nearly impossible to get a dinner reservation but they are still charging a 3% fee for COVID? I am so confused. I hope they bring back their full menu. Service was very good, as always. And the food they did have was excellent. Just feels like a money grab..."
,,,,,Been here twice and every time it just gets better and better. The potatoes bravas are things I dream about in my sleep. And the bacon wrapped dates? Yes yum! Sangria is also fantastic and I love the different types. My service has been timely and attentive and the interior decor is so fun! We love the ambiance and often find ourselves wanting to bring our friends here when they visit. It's a must!
,,,,,Great place to take people who are visiting the city! Not typically a tapas fan but this place is unbelievably good!!Inside is huge and there's something on the menu for everyone!
,,,,,"Favorite place to go with a big group. Must orders: pitcher of sangria, bacon wrapped dates, patatas bravas (yes it's just potatoes but they do it very well), seafood paella, and the calamari. Shishito peppers, meatballs, tomato bread, and wagyu bites were ok"
,,,,,Name a restaurant that has better sangria or spicy potatoes. It doesn't exist. I've had Cafe Ba-Ba-Rebba take out twice since mid-March. The quality and consistency here are always so high. The flavors from the take out make me want to wait in line and be one of the first people in when they reopen their doors.
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. One of the things I like the most is the exceptional level of consistency. The tapas and pintxos are always a solid choice and the service staff is friendly, helpful and quick every time. In my opinion, this restaurant is a great place to have not only a nice casual dinner, but also to celebrate special occasions with friends or family in a laid-back but lively ambience. "
,,,,,"My personal favorite are the patatas bravas. I have eaten tapas all around the world, from Latin America to Spain, in amazing restaurants and tapas bars but I have to say Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba's patatas bravas are simply the best I've ever had."

,,,,,Great food and good service. Great for a group to come and order a bunch of small plates to share.
,,,,,"Let me start off by saying I am not Spanish but I DID study abroad in Barcelona for a semester so that makes me *super duper credible* hahaha jk. My great grandfather is Spanish though, but that also doesn't mean much, I never even met the guy... Anyway, I love this place! I actually may become a Sunday regular because of all their options, seasonal items, and it's proximity to my church. I love tapas style dining- sharing good food with others is one of my favorite things in the world. Okay, so the service here was pretty normal and positive. Nothing extraordinary but definitely had a kind server. Our order was messed up and we weren't going to say anything but he actually noticed, apologized, and brought it up himself which we were so impressed by! "
,,,,,"Food and drink wise, their fall sangria was so good. Their patatas bravas, some of the best I've had. The potatoes were so well seasoned and the sauce... ugh, amazing. Shrimp & grits... life changer. Those three things were honestly the show stopping, jaw dropping items. Their flavors were so on point and so delicious I could've eaten them twice."
,,,,,The french toast and the cubano were also really good but the other dishes by far outshined these. 
,,,,,"What I love about this restaurant is the authenticity. I've gone to other ""tapas"" restaurants that sell chicken wings, flatbreads, and just very American, definitely not Spanish things. But this place has very authentic options! "
,,,,,And I only got such a small amount of items compared to what their menu offers. I would definitely pay this place a visit if you're in the area. Their food was definitely 5 star worthy! I have so many more things to try here.
,,,,,"TLDR: Great atmosphere, pretty good food + amazing sangria -- but expect a long wait (even with a reservation). Free dessert with check-in on Yelp!"
,,,,,"I would recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to anyone who is looking for a place to grab a drink and some tapas, but I'd also advise to block off a good chunk of time when coming to eat here."
,,,,,"I got to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba early for our 9:30PM reservation, and was told that my party would be seated soon. My boyfriend and I made our way to the bar to get some blackberry sangria while we waited, which was incredible. We decided to get the half pitcher, which ended up being about a glass and a half of sangria per person. "
,,,,,There are three serving sizes when it comes to the sangria: 
,,,,,- 1 glass
,,,,,- 1/2 pitcher (the equivalent of 3 glasses)
,,,,,- 1 pitcher (the equivalent of 6 glasses)
,,,,,"We waited for at least half an hour by the bar, and then went to go check in with the hostess regarding our seats as we had expected to be seated closer to the time of our reservation. I was happy to wait as I wasn't in a hurry, but would have definitely been frustrated by this if I were on a tight schedule that night. It didn't feel as though a reservation helped us secure a table for the time that we had intended to eat around."
,,,,,"When we were finally seated, we had a hard time getting someone to take our order. Another party that had been seated around the time that we had were already starting to eat their tapas, and we still didn't have anyone come up to our table. I eventually had to let someone know that we were ready to take our order in order to get a waiter to our table. "
,,,,,"Our waiter was incredible and extremely helpful when it came to narrowing down our options. With his help, we decided to order the following:"
,,,,,- Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli (would recommend)
,,,,,- Bacalao croquette with sherry aioli (would skip)
,,,,,- Spinach & Manchego-stuffed mushrooms (would recommend)
,,,,,"- Buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, piri-piri sauce & shaved vegetable salad (would recommend)"
,,,,,"- Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes (would skip)"
,,,,,- Caramelized banana (for dessert)
,,,,,- Butterscotch custard (for dessert)
,,,,,Reminder to check-in on Yelp to get a free dessert!
,,,,,"I would recommend a max of about four tapas between two people (we underestimated the serving sizes of some of the tapas) -- especially if you are also getting drinks and dessert. The caramelized bananas were absolutely incredible as well. Overall, it was a great experience! "
,,,,,"I absolutely love the atmosphere of the restaurant and its exposed brick, hanging string lights, window ceilings, and beautiful paintings. "
,,,,,"The fact that we ended up getting seated half an hour after our reservation and had to continue to wait to get served after that -- knocked the experience down for us, however."
,,,,,My absolute favorite place for sangria and tapas! I love sitting outside and the passionfruit sangria is a must try!
,,,,,"Holy oh my god. This place is absolute fire. Sangria is typically too sweet for me but hot damn this one is perfect, and not too badly priced (go for the full pitcher). We ordered all tapas and everything we had was absolutely on point. Bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, piri-piri chicken, spinach and manchego mushrooms, and so much more (we ordered a lot). Wow. Obsessed. Also try the butterscotch desert because another 10/10 recommendation."
,,,,,Delicious tapas!!! Love the name of this place too haha. The service is here is impECCABLE. Our server kept checking up on us and refilling our drinks. He was super friendly and helpful. Don't forget to check-in for a free dessert tapa! Loved the decor and vibes here.
,,,,,"We started with a pitcher for Cava Sangria between 3 people. It was basically the perfect amount. About 3 drinks per person. It was fruity and delicious. We got Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Spinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms, Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego platter, and Grilled Octopus with mojo verde, potatoes, olives, migas. Everything was delicious and quite filling even tho they were small plates. I like how they indicate the popular items in red on the menu. For dessert, we got Caramelized Banana, Chocolate Truffle Cake, and Butterscotch Custard. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here especially the popular (red) items."
,,,,,Great service! The happy hour is awesome and the Sangria is a must have when you go. They have done a great job keeping people warm and safe with COVID guidelines
,,,,,"This place was amazing!  Everyone's favorite at the table was their Brussels sprouts salad. It was ""a to die for"" dish. The tables second favorite was the bacon wrapped dates; they were amazing! (We even ordered a second helping of these). Next their goat cheese with tomato sauce was Yum!  The seafood paella was delicious!  The steak dish was good but couldn't hold a candle to the other plates. Great service and atmosphere and very clean (I really pay attention to that with the pandemic on going). I have nothing but great things to say about this place!!"

,,,,,"This restaurant in Lincoln Park is definitely nicer than any tapas places in the Loop. Great atmosphere, beautiful restaurant, and a great spot for brunch or dinner. A large selection of tapas and its known for its Sangria, which was delicious. We had the shrimp with garlic, fried calamari, lamb, a couple empanadas, and the scallops. Small portions, but delicious. Definitely order a few dishes and then you can split them among yourselves since some are larger than others. "

I'm glad I made reservation because it was packed! Pitcher of sangria is something you want to start with. Bread is out of this world, I am from Europe and was missing normal bread in US but this one brought me to the other continent. Many great options in the menu, and prices are very very reasonable.

But the manager at ba ba reeba offered to move my 7 top table to sit at one of the bars that wasn't in use since she could tell we were having a great time! It was complete unexpected and unnecessary, but she made it clear she cared about our experience and it made our night. Thanks guys!!"

,,,,,Ordered takeout and the portion sizes were abysmal for the meat tapas. Paellas were solid but I couldn't get past the fact that I paid $50 for 3 bite sized dishes.
,,,,,So it's my first time trying this place out but I was a little disappointed. I went there with my friends that have been there before. We pre ordered the seafood paella before we got there so when we were seated it wouldn't take long. The paella was bland and salty. The texture was good but just wasn't flavorful.

,,,,,Highly recommending coming here for happy hour! The restaurant has one of the best happy hour menus/ deals in Chicago!
,,,,,"This place never fails to amaze me. I love love love the variety on the menu. I am definitely a ""grazer"" and love to have a little bit of everything, so tapas and small plates shared among a small group is perfect for me. This evening I shared patatas bravas (ALL TIME FAV!!!!!!!!), goat cheese and tomato sauce, Brussel sprout salad, and a beef empanada. While my friend said she felt the salad was over-dressed, I thought it was perfect. And the spicy tomato aioli that comes with the potatoes and empanada is outstanding...creamy, hot, and tangy. "
,,,,,"Best part, each one of us *Checked-In* on yelp and got a free dessert tapas and all of them were delish!"
,,,,,"We visited Ba-ba-reeba the other night. I took out my aunt who was in town visiting, my wife and my brother and my mom. The service once again has been impeccable, as it has always been with your restaurant. Yes, that was not my first time enjoying a beautiful evening at your establishment. Actually, it would also be fair to note that to maintain that level of service with labor shortage....is nothing less than remarkable. We ordered many tapas, pitchers of sangria and of course the Paella de Mariscos for 4 people. Everything tasted phenomenal, the freshly toasted bread used was out of this world. Dishes came in flying, presentation was beautiful yet simple. The only reason why I am giving it 3 stars, is sadly the experience we've had with Paella. I am a strong believer, that if you decide to put something very ethnic on your menu. Something that is known to require skill and quality ingredients to make. Something that is a pride of another culture....you gotta go all out and make it Spectacular. 10 stars. Otherwise don't attempt it at all. In the case with paella from your restaurant, which I've ordered for the first time, it was far from perfect. The rice was wet, the Cod used was most definitely living its last day before being tossed. There was no WOW effect! The portion however was insane, I mean it was a paella for 4 and it came out to around $75. However 6 people could've easily shared it with no issues. One last thing, even though it looked like the Paella was distributed table side, I am almost 100% CERTAIN it was not cooked in the pan but rather precooked before. Which is by Spanish traditions considered a crime. Point is, if you do decide to continue with serving Paella, and you are concerned about costs and still trying to keep the same profit margin as before. Just lower you portion size, to about half the size. Take the savings from that and invest it in the ingredient quality and preparation. I would pay that $75 but for the better product, and MUCH rather sacrifice the portion size. After all it is a European dish, it does not need American sized portion. I remember one of the things Rich said, back in the day. "" guests will always remain loyal to quality, not quantity""."
,,,,,"Love this place! pitchers are great size worth the money and every dish we tried was amazing! i would skip the olives and go for the calamari,bacon wrapped dates and of course the wagu beef with truffles! the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli were also so good! very filling place I would stick with their recommendation and get at least 3 plates per person. overall fun atmosphere and with the heaters and tents up it wasn't cold at all"
,,,,,"After hearing about this place for such a long time and trying to come many times I FINALLY MADE IT. Stopped by the day after Thanksgiving to have lunch with my family. The four of us ordered squash soup ($5), brussel sprouts salad ($7), the cheese plate($10), garlic shrimp ($9.50), squid ($11), beef empanada (6.50), hanger steak ($13), lamb skewer ($9), and we two desserts - chocolate truffle and Spanish affogato. There's free dessert with your yelp check-in!"
,,,,,"While all of the dishes we got were absolutely delicious, my three favorites were the garlic shrimp, squid, and the hanger steak. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and was a blast of flavor the moment you put it in your mouth, yet not overwhelming. I'm not the biggest fan of garlic, but the combination with lemon and the pepper flakes gave it the perfect kick of spice and tang. The same went with the squid, which was chewy and tender. While this seems simple, many places serve it way too chewy making it hard to tear apart and swallow. The hanger steak - nice and medium rare, tender, and full of flavor. "
,,,,,"I loved that the portions were just right. We left feeling full but not bloated.  8 dishes, two desserts for the price wasn't bad at all! Without a doubt, I would return again and will definitely be recommending it to friends and visitors!"
,,,,,"Cute spot for tapas. I personally liked the vibe a little better than the food. Low lighting, social kind of mood as it's always busy. Great spot for small plates, good drinks"
,,,,,"Awesome place - cool environment, great food, delicious Sangria!! We had the croquettes & the bread for an appetizer... you must try the croquettes!! For our main meal we split the seafood paella... also delicious and the right amount of food for 2-3 people. Oh and the dessert flight was to die for, especially the butterscotch custard. Lastly, make sure you get a pitcher of Sangria (also delicious and 5-6 glasses total)."
,,,,,"I know this place is already extremely popular and doesn't need the help of my review, but I feel like raving. "
,,,,,"I moved to Chicago this past January, and it was one of the first places my partner and I were recommended to go to. Am I forever grateful for that recommendation? Why yes, yes I am. "
,,,,,"We started our anniversary celebration with brunch here, I've brought my family and friends here, I've ordered take-out more times than I care to admit and frankly, if it wasn't for this global pandemic, I would've been here almost every weekend. Both brunch and dinner are a total success, the service is always so friendly, the sangrias are spot-on and the ham croquetas? Yeah, I'm the table with at least 3 orders. "
,,,,,"I've visited since their reopening and they've taken the necessary measures for everyone's safety. They've removed tons of tables so it only reaches 50% capacity, there's a limited time for seating, and staff is wearing masks and gloves. "

,,,,,"I can't rave about the chicken empanada here enough... is soo flakey and delicious is it a must-have and everyone should just get their own, no point in sharing bc you'll just want more after you try it!"
,,,,,the bloody mary bar is also really yummy. Great weekend brunch spot!
,,,,,"Ordered the pinxtos platter, red sangria, and paella mixtas. We really liked the nduja sausage & ricotta crostini on the platter. Red sangria had great fruity flavors and the paella was very savory. Waitress was nice and food came out fast. This is a good place to come unwind with friends."

,,,,,The food and service is always constantly good!
,,,,,It's too busy and crowded for a first date but great for parties group of friends excellent;)
,,,,,Great service and fantastic food! 
,,,,,I've come here both for dinner as well as for brunch. I would definitely recommend both very highly.
,,,,,The sangria is also quite good.
,,,,,The plates are served as small plates or tapas and are meant for sharing and you should order around 3ish per person depending on how hungry you are.
,,,,,"Came here to meet friends. Great service. The tapas are mid-range to pricey. I was very ok about the food, nothing was bad but I didn't find a dish I really liked. Quite heavy (everything sauced with aioli) . Maybe we just didn't order the right thing? We got the chicken paella and 4 tapas dishes, total was maybe $140-160 (friend paid, friends had a drink each). It's a cute place, but it wasn't for me, especially for the price."
,,,,,"Amazing!! From start to finish simply amazing! Paz was our server and she was great and very attentive. I can't say enough about their octopus and squid, simply stellar!!! This was the most tender and perfectly done octopus I have ever eaten, so evenly cooked! The paella, white, and red sangria were also so flavorful and worth it. Make sure you ask for your paella to come with the crust because that's where allll the flavor is!"
,,,,,"I came here to celebrate my 30th birthday with family. I couldn't have chosen a better place to do so. The food was amazing, especially the octopus and the potatoes!"
,,,,,"It's ""exotic"" cuisine for Midwesterners who think ketchup is spicy. Very overrated. "
,,,,,The sangria is good if you feel like getting white girl wasted.
,,,,,"This place was okay for a large group for a bday party. Our server was very nice and accommodating. Should describe the portion size better though because we ended up ordering way too much based on the recommendations. The food wasn't to die for. quality wasn't that good. Shrimp seemed as if they were frozen not fresh, and very small. Known for their paella but was definitely not impressed with it. Not crispy and slightly soggy. Even the presentation at table side wasn't very entertaining. He just kind of dumped it into a plate and left it. Didn't describe which was which or anything. Sangria was the best thing there. Most likely won't come again."

,,,,,Great service and amazing food. 
,,,,,Decided to visit before leaving Chicago after a wonderful weekend celebrating my birthday. It was definitely cherry on top of our trip because the food was absolutely fantastic. We ended up getting their popular items and a pitcher of sangria.
,,,,,This is our go-to place to take people whenever we have guests staying over in Chicago. The food is good and we always have a good time. The seafood paella is on point and the sangria is awesome. They do breakfast on weekends too and the portions are pretty big for the breakfast plates! Service is generally really good. I recommend making reservations ahead of time because they get really busy.
,,,,,Have been here multiple times and each time we come back we feel like we're experiencing this brand new amazing restaurant each time! From the spicy potatoes that are to die for to the seasonal sangrias... you'll be blown away by the food and drink. 
,,,,,The wait staff is always friendly and on point. I would suggest making a reservation especially if it's more than 2 people. We have only once walked in with a party of 2 and have got seated within 20 mins. 
,,,,,"It's a great place for birthday dinners as well. In the back of the side room, they have a few larger family style tables. "
,,,,,It's always nice to share some sangria with friends but getting your own pitcher isn't a bad idea either! :P
,,,,,"My favorite restaurant in Chicago! They always have the most amazing Sangria that is so fresh and no syrups. The paella is also soooo worth the wait and absolutely delicious. It is also soooo big can definitely eat between 3 people. All tapas are great, the spicy potatoes are amazing. I live so close which is dangerous bc I always want to go!"
,,,,,"Great place for good tapas! I've been here many times and always loved coming back. Some of my favorites include patatas bravas, burrata, shrimps with garlic, fried calamari. I really loved their paella too. Also, you must try their pinxtos - which are nothing but really small snacks. Their bacon wrapped dates, deviled eggs, croquettes and crostini - all were delicious."
,,,,,"let's see....I went for brunch and there was a mysterious hair in my food, and the plates and silverware were dirty. the service was also pretty bad. I added a star because the paella was good. I just don't think I can come back here in good faith."
,,,,,My second time at this restaurant and it was still delicious like the first time. The problem this time around was I wasn't as hungry so I couldn't eat as much as I wanted to but the food was still good. 
,,,,,We didn't order anything too heavy. We got a lot of tapas and enjoyed sampling them.
,,,,, 
,,,,,"We got several items but the one I always go back to is the octopus one. The sauce, to the texture and how it was cooked. It was nicely executed. The paella is good but we didn't get it time because it's heavier but it's definitely yummy."
,,,,,Do you love tapas and sangria? If yes then this is the place for you! Came here for brunch with some friends and you can order from the brunch and regular tapas menu!
,,,,,"To start, we ordered a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria which is about 4-5 glasses. Fruity and refreshing without being too sweet. If you like Bloody Mary's they have a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar with all the works including shrimp, bacon, assorted veg, spices, different tomato juices etc mixed with your choice of spirit. Personally not a fan of Bloody Marys - I feel like tomato's are incompatible as bevvies and should only be served in food or soup form. "
,,,,,Pintxos: bite-sized tapas popular in Northern Spain. Literally bite-sized and a serving for one. I tried the deviled egg which was decent. They have sweet and savory pintxos to choose from or you can get the pintxos platter with all of them for $13. 
,,,,,"From the brunch tapas menu, we tried the following: "
,,,,,1. Citrus French Toast - delicious fluffy French toast with the most delicious goat cheese butter! Thought the goat cheese butter was unique and gave the classic brunch item a special kick 
,,,,,"2. Cubano - favorite savory brunch item we tried. We ordered two orders of this classic sammie for our party of five. The bread kind of looks like an English muffin but tastes so much better. Rather than tasting like cardboard it was buttery and crispy on the outside and soft inside filled with tender pork shoulder, pickles, mustard aioli and manchego. What a combo! "
,,,,,"3. Sausage-fried Paella Rice with Poached Egg: paella was good but nothing remarkable. Everything does taste better with an egg on it though, especially if it's poached."
,,,,,From the regular tapas menu: 
,,,,,"1. Octopus a la Plancha - possibly the best octopus I've had, smooth texture and tender to taste marinated with vinaigrette. Not chewy or over cooked like some octopus can be. Also comes with some cute purple potatoes "
,,,,,2. Roast Dates with Bacon - if you are a fan of bacon and dates you must try this. It may sound like a weird pair at first but it's the perfect balance of sweet and savory. Much better than the date-glazed bacon!
,,,,,"3. Burrata - yum creamy melt in your mouth mozzarella, comes with some crispy toasted bread "
,,,,,4. Buttermilk-fried Chicken Thighs - more saucy and less crispy than regular American fried chicken but still tastes good and at least tastes like it's less atherosclerotic 
,,,,,Overall had a wonderful experience here! Don't forget to check in for a free dessert. Of the desserts the flan was my favorite :) will be back soon!
,,,,,"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! I believe it is a 5* place for food and service. I will endure the backed up traffic drive in and trouble with finding parking for the wonderful food and staff. Rachel, was the standout this time. She went over and beyond to serve us with a smile and efficiency. "
,,,,, I took off a star this time because I did not notice they charged a 3% added fee on the check. Stop it owners! It was packed on a Tuesday evening so there is no reason for it anymore. 
,,,,,"Besides our faves of the Brussel Sprout Salad, Fried Calamari and Goat Cheese with garlic bread, we tried a few new items. The Piri-Piri fried chicken thighs were excellent and the Meatballs had a spice like I have never tasted before, so good. We always get the red Sangria(like no other) and this time ended with a Chocolate Truffle for dessert. Everything was awesome!"
,,,,,"Was very busy but the service was outstanding and the food amazing as last time! Got our must haves of Brussels Sprout Salad, The Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread and Sangria. This time we tried the Fried Calamari which came with a spicy aioli which was excellent. We really liked the Sweet Potato Soup but it was a very small portion and could have eaten more. We did not care for the Chickpea Stew, filled with a lot of corn. Ended with a delicious chocolate truffle. Satisfaction."
,,,,,"Came here for an early dinner before it got crowded. The restaurant is comfortable, food was good, service was excellent but expect a pricey bill. We ordered the excellent tasting Brussels Sprout Salad. I would love this recipe. The Chicken Empanada was ok, I wasn't crazy about the crust. The Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread was excellent and a nice portion. The Salmon with root veggies was tasty but a small portion size for price. The Rioja-Braised Short Rib was our least favorite as the meat was tough and tasted more like pot roast then short rib. The Sangria was very good.  I would return to try other dishes."
,,,,,First time a tonight and I can't wait to go back! The atmosphere is welcoming and very spacious. Our server and the food runners were very tentative. Food was outstanding and the peach sangria is to die for! Highly recommend them!

,,,,,"What a great vibe! Love their tapas-style food, but their sangria is where it is at!! The pear-elderflower sangria was delicious. If you're a vegetarian like me, the stuffed mushrooms, patatas bravas with tomato ailoli, and brussel sprout salad are great choices. I was way too hungry for pictures :)"
,,,,,One of the best places to have tapas. I love the food. It's rich with flavor. The patatas bravas is the best.  The Sangria was delicious. I recommend it for date night. It's a nice quiet atmosphere with good music and people. Very diverse crowd.
,,,,,Holy cats!!! I am shocked at the value/ food quality and service. Everything was amazing and very affordable. Between the 2 of us we ordered 5-6 tapas. We were very satisfied and it came out to be $15 a person!! Wow! The service was quick and friendly. The food was delicious! Highly recommend!
,,,,,I'm gonna start by saying this has been my favorite restaurant for 12 years. But recently they have changed the pitcher size for sangria. The full pitcher looks like the half pitcher and the half pitcher looks like a big glass super disappointed and feeling like they are trying to get over on ppl.
,,,,,Hands down my favorite tapas restaurant in Chicago! Also my favorite Spanish restaurant.
,,,,,"This is definitely a splurge kind of place, but well worth it. Let's start with the drinks. Their sangrias are TO DIE FOR!! They are so incredibly delicious and dangerous."
,,,,,"Every time I come I get items that are starred on their menu. I always get their chorizo-wrapped medjool dates. Out of all iterations of this dish in Chicago, THIS one is my favorite. The date is so fat I usually need 3-4 bites to eat the whole thing."
,,,,,"Some other highly recommended dishes: buttermilk fried chicken, octopus a la plancha, hanger steak, short rib, bruschetta, and paella. I have yet to have a better paella dish in Chicago."
,,,,,"Service is so attentive and warm as well. The last time I was here celebrating an anniversary, and they brought us free dessert at the end of our meal for it. Another time we had a massive group (over 20) and they comfortably accommodated us. Can't wait to come back again."
,,,,,"I hate to give this place a bad review, because the service was great. The sangria was amazing and some of the food was delicious. Now why the bad review. Well first they seated us on a table outside and it smelled like garbage. They server kindly moved us as he can smell it as well. Next my wife ordered the spanish omelette and when she cut into it there was a plastic bag in it. While they did not change us for the replacement omelette. Still it is pretty bad to have plastic in the food."
,,,,,Came here last week with a group of 10 and met beforehand in the bar. We came here to honor my son. My experience as I've been here several times before is that the bar service is just too slow. Which is why I took off a star. They only had one bartender and it was dinner time and getting drinks for our group was slow. This is happened in the past so I don't know if that's just how they operate their bar area. We had pictures of the red sangria and the carve a sangria. My recollection of the cava sangria wasn't the same as what we were served. So I don't know if that recipe has been changed. You can't lose with any of the sangrias that they serve there. A few people in our group and individual drinks and they were quite happy with them as well.
,,,,,We were able to make reservations for our group and were seated rather close to our reservation time. I am not sure of the servers name but it was a gentleman that had our group. He was efficient and quick with bringing out the dishes. As always the food was delicious. 
,,,,,"When we get together we always order the bacon wrapped dates, the goat cheese, shrimp, scallops, patatas bravas ( potatoes) is always a hit, plus chicken and a few desserts. since softshell blue crab were in season we also tried a few of those!"
,,,,,"We ordered the paella which was the first time of me ever having it there. Since I've been to Spain I'm probably a little more particular about that dish and I would just say that I wouldn't order it again. But everything else as  always, outstanding. "
,,,,,The restaurant has a very large area and is good for groups or four smaller tables as well. The weight to just check in with the hostess can be long. But they must be doing something right to have so much business there.
,,,,,For me it's amazing that They are always able to serve so many dishes and it's always crowded and yet the food always tastes delicious. 
,,,,,"I'm sure we will be there again as the food is great, we will just have to figure out a better way to get service at the bar. If you are looking for a great tapas place this is it!"
,,,,,"A memorable place! Exquisite taste on food, beautiful design and lively atmosphere. Wonderful staff, gorgeous surroundings, delicious food!"
,,,,,"its always been a pleasure to dine here ....our family chose to come here instead of Pilsen restaurant week just because we weren't in a mood for anything new. We were no.1 on the waitlist @ 3.15pm and were seated in 5 minutes by the bar in the dingiest part of the restaurant, I was getting claustrophobic while the family was just happy to go ahead and order. I requested to be seated in the main dining area and Ava at the front desk (i think) immediately obliged. We were so much more happy in the new location and it enhanced our dining experience greatly."
,,,,,"We ordered the 1/2 pitcher of red classic sangria which is excellent, Croquttes, Chicken empanada, Brussels sprouts, lamb chops, chicken & Chorizo skewer, scallops. Desserts we got chocolate cake, almond bar, flan and some berry sponge cake with icecream. We also got a free dessert with Yelp Checkin. I love coming here and hope we always get seated in the main dining space!!!"
,,,,,Our friends hosted a b'day party in the Granada Room and I was thoroughly impressed with the different courses of tapas brought in by the unflustered waiters....it was tightly packed for a crowd of 50 including kids but the service was top notch with the drinks and all! certainly see why we all keep coming back here!!
,,,,,"Can i give it 10 Stars or 5+ stars? I came here to dine after nearly a decade and it was a sweet experience! Met up with some gal pals in this totally packed restaurant and of course started off with a pitcher of white wine sangria. Every single tapa we ordered was outstatnding. Spicy potatotes, something goat cheese, peppers, eggplant , squash, brussels sprouts i cant remember them all. The only thing we didnt care for was the paella and our server Danny quickly replaced it with other stuff and had the manager come and talk to us and apologize. Danny was phenomenal with customer service, very attentive and didnt get flustered with us constantly flagging him down. Also, we were given free desserts on the house along with taking the charge off for Paella.  It was one of the best enjoyable meals that i have had in a longtime which was also very inexpensive(literally, $20/person plus tip)."
,,,,,"Absolutely amazing experience! As other reviewers have mentioned, the ""Paella Mixta"" is a MUST. Other favorites: spicy potatoes, baked goat cheese, grilled pork with chimichurri, and the tortilla espanola. SO GOOD!! We followed our lovely server's suggestion to order 2-3 tapas per person and it was way too much food for us personally, but they were kind about our failure to finish our food and brought boxes. All dishes were excellent reheated the next morning as well."

,,,,,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! I took my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday and we had an amazing dining experience. The waiter, Chad, did a great job of recommending foods and making sure we were always taken care of. The food was phenomenal. We ordered patatas bravas, beef hangar skewers, seared txistorra sausage, shrimp with garlic, watermelon sangria, paella mixta, and the butter scotch flan. Every single dish was delicious and flavorful. The patatas bravas came with a spicy tomato aoili that complimented the potatoes well, and added a nice kick of heat to the dish. The potatoes were crispy and cooked perfectly. The beef hangar skewers were cooked to a perfect medium rare. They were juicy and tender and the horse radish sour cream elevated the natural flavor of the beef exquisitely. The sausage was similar to chorizo, but better! It came with a pickled mustard seeds that added a great zesty acidic element to the dish. The shrimp was by far the best shrimp I ever had. It was cooked perfectly and wasn't too chewy. The garlic and the peppers gave the shrimp a delicious unique flavor and the garlic was nice and sautéed, it was tasty too. We went with the waiters recommendation of trying the daily special of watermelon sangria and we're happy we did. It tasted like juice! It was very sweet and fruity just how I like. The paella was the best part of the meal. It had so many different layers of flavor with the soft green peppers, moist falling apart pork, juicy chicken thigh, and delectable salchichon. The rice was cooked to perfection and was full of flavor. We ended the meal with the butter scotch flan recommended by the waiter. It was the perfect ending to the meal and it was a good portion for 2 people. We ended the meal feeling full, but not hating ourselves for overeating and we felt like we tried so many different dishes and flavors as well. When it came time to pay for the bill, I asked if they offered military discount and they gave me 50% off my bill! I was shocked and ecstatic! I had an amazing food experience and I will make it a priority to always visit Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba every time I'm in Chicago. I highly recommend this restaurant to any locals or tourists visiting the city. It was great drinks, amazing food, and excellent service. The parking wasn't even that bad for being in the city. I will say you will need a reservation unless you want to be waiting a long time, but I think that's a testament to how great the restaurant is. I can't wait until the next time I come to Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba! I will definitely be bringing friends and family so they can experience it as well!"

Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba will forever be a favorite of mine and I will continue coming back. The tapas are excellent, but the paella is to die for, so make sure to save some room for it! And definitely don't skip out on the desserts!"
,,,,,Every thing was good.  Loved the ham croquettes and the aioli was tasty on everything.  Would go back just for truffle dessert.
,,,,,One of the best happy hours I've ever been to!! Their sangria is amazing and small plates are wonderful. Can't wait to go back!
,,,,,"A friend of mine wanted to take us to a fancy restaurant in Chicago.  As the number of reviews speak themselves, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a very popular spot to taste Spanish tapas.  As we had to change our schedule multiple times to find the most ideal time for us to get together, we ended up making a reservation at last minute.  It was Sunday and the only opening they had available for us was 10AM for brunch.  "
,,,,,"The restaurant is located in North Chicago - it was a bit far away from Chicago downtown.  Very friendly and cozy atmosphere with plenty of dining table options to cover any size of party.  The lighting was perfect in the morning with enough natural light coming in to sit back and enjoy our talk with great foods an drink.  On the table, there were many small plates stacking all the way up - that's the tapas style!"

,,,,,"That's a lot for three people, right?  I strongly recommend getting scallops and octopus."
,,,,,We started off with the baked goat cheese and tomato sauce and had the paella mixta.
,,,,,The baker cheese with a buttered garlic bread what's delicious.  the goat cheese with luscious and spread beautifully on the bread.
,,,,,"The paella mixta is a combination of chicken thighs, salami and pork shoulder.  Combination of the meats and the rice was delicious. The only thing I wish for was a better socarrat.  but here in the states it's almost impossible to find one that's really good."
,,,,,Overall we really enjoyed our meal and I think you will too.
,,,,,"This restaurant is very interesting. You can order their tiny small dish such as roast date with bacon & apple vinaigrette. We just ordered all of them! Almost feel like we are eat at all you can eat. For my personal opinion, the paella is more like a combination flavor of Asian and Spanish food, kind of like Hawaii food too. Very unique!"
,,,,,Amazing food that's reasonably priced! Took my 8-year old son here on a Saturday afternoon -- he loved it! The food comes pretty quick and is really good. 10/10 recommend
,,,,,"This spot was the best spot for a birthday celebration! It was so busy, we were drinking homemade sangria the whole night. My entire party was truly enjoying themselves.

,,,,,"Additionally, tapas that are a must try are the bacon wrapped dates with a splendid mix of sweet and savory, as well as the chopped brussel sprout salad, whose texture is both refreshing and joyously crunchy from the walnuts that are mixed it."
,,,,,Our wait staff was very attentive and offered many selection favourites that we provided above. Definitely a place to revisit with large parties that enjoy sampling many types of foods!
,,,,,Sooooo good! Been here multiples times and never disappoints. Bacon wrapped dates and peach sangria are amazing!! Great tapas spot! Consistent every time!
,,,,,Great food lovely Passion fruit Sangria. Paella and patatas bravas were delicious! Good experience
,,,,,The skinny: Great tapas and amazing bloody mary bar!
,,,,,"Atmosphere: Went during brunch and it can get quite packed, they accept reservations so I would recommend that. Decent amount of space inside with a small patio."
,,,,,"Food and drinks: Blood Mary bar! Great deal and selection, you get your choice of vodkas and can go up to the bar to get mix and toppings. With the amount of toppings they have (bacon and shrimp!) it's basically its own tapas. Lot of good food as well. My favorite were garlic shrimp, brunch paella, and onion/potato quiche. Papas bravas (potatoes) were surprisingly not as good as I would have liked - liked a bit of flavor. Kept some of the garlic shrimp sauce to dip other things in (like the quiche). Didn't expect to like it, but the quiche was surprisingly amazing - actually one of my favorite dishes that I had. "
,,,,,"Service: Quick, friendly and attentive service."
,,,,,"Price/value: $$ regular tapas prices, but some of the portions were actually quite decent. Might have been the first time I've been full from tapas without paying an exuberant amount. Great value for bloody mary bar. $10"
,,,,,Would I come again: If I was in the area yes! Can't get over the bloody - and the paella and quiche were great.
,,,,,"We ordered the classic red sangria and it was tasty. Good amount of fruit. Too much ice. I wish restaurants would stop putting too much ice in pitchers. Just give me the pitcher with little ice and 3/4 full rather than ""filling up"" the pitcher with all the ice. The ice waters down the drink. "
,,,,,The beef empanada was so good. The outside was flaky to perfection. It's bigger than other empanadas I've tried but for the price it should have been bigger. The meatballs and sauce were good. I liked re-dipping the meatballs in the sauce.
,,,,,Wow!
,,,,,"Finally got to spend some time here and it was fantastic. From the excellent bread to the authentic sangria, you're in for a treat. "
,,,,,"We split several items, as you're expected to. Perfect burrata, delicious stuffed mushrooms, and wagyu beef ""sliders"" that are out of this world. Top it off with one of the better shrimp paellas I've had and you're golden."
,,,,,Went here for an anniversary dinner during winter Restaurant Week. We were initially seated on the outdoor patio. There was a bad smell (possibly from a sewer outside?) and the staff was very gracious about reseating us. 
,,,,,"We ordered all our favorite tapas plus a few new things from the RW menu. We were very pleased overall with the quality, especially the bacon wrapped dates, deviled eggs, & octopus. "
,,,,,"Sangria was overly sweet for my taste but my husband loved it. They have a great cocktail menu too, so no complaints!"
,,,,,Sangria and tapas are always the perfect date night with friends or loved ones. We love getting to share foods and tapas are the perfect option. Each and every one of them were delicious and the atmosphere was perfect!
,,,,,"We met our daughter at Café Ba Ba Reeba recently for Saturday brunch.  And, we're really glad she found this place!"
,,,,,This is what we liked:
,,,,,"- The place is huge.  We got a great table, tucked away in a corner.  The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting...and not too loud."
,,,,,"- We ordered tapas...the waiter was right about needing ~6 plates for three people.  But, we couldn't resist also getting the Natilla Flan dessert, which we all shared.  Other standout plates were the Burrata, the Octopus, the Spinach Crepe, and the Vegetable Benedict."
,,,,,"- We got a pitcher of Mango Sangria (a seasonal special), which made the entire experience even more enjoyable."
,,,,,"- Service was good.  Our waiter came by from time to time as needed.  The best part was that the small tapas plates were staggered over time...one or two at a time arrived, which really enhanced the overall dining experience."
,,,,,"- Coffee was ok, but nothing spectacular."
,,,,,"Bottom line: Great brunch venue, fun to try so many different items, and the festive vibe really started our day out right!"

,,,,,Ba Ba BABY this place is wild from start to finish. Down in the dumps because no one can travel in 2020? Still wanna go to Spain? Call yourself a lift and come on down to Ba Ba Reeba and pour a vat of Sangria into your face and you'll feel as if you were running with the bulls - AND NOT THE CHICAGO ONES. 
,,,,,"I'll be honest, I was having a BAD day, I was grumpy as hell, and I arrived with an attitude as big as the great state of Texas. I was missing my Abuela back in Mallorca something fierce and I was ready to tear apart the authenticity of their ""spanish"" food. Now, Clarence is man enough to realize when he's wrong - and boy was I _equivocado_"
,,,,,"I ordered the largest vat barrel of Sangria they had, and some meatball dish made of several different animals. I almost swallowed them balls of ground up flesh whole they were so delicious - I even asked a passing waiter if he knew the heimlich maneuver JUST in case! I'm a safety first kinda guy, the kinda guy who wears elbow pads under my work shirts in case a rogue banan peel finds it's wat beneath my feet. "
,,,,,"Ok back to the sangria- they have like 5 different kinds and they are like, EVEN CHEAPER ON MONDAYS. I'm a busy air conditioner repair man- and Tuesdays are usually my busiest days (people are HOT for Tuesdays) but I herebye announce my hiatus from ever working a Tuesday repairing cold blasting air ever the hell again. From henceforth Tuesdays shall only be known as SANGRIA RECKONING DAY. On mondays you shall refer to me as Clarence EL BORRACHO DEL SANGRITITA."
,,,,,The tapas here are pretty alright. Definitely decently priced and can be shared with friends. I felt like it was all pretty standard though and nothing stuck out or struck me as amazing.
,,,,,"The restaurant opened at 4, and we walked in at 4:05. When there were already multiple tables seated I knew we would be in for a good meal! By 4:15 the bar area was full for happy hour. Both the white sangria and margaritas were good! Started off with the potatoes and tomato bread. The potatoes were were really good, and the tomato bread was traditional like real Spanish pan de tomate! We also loved the calamari and olives. The happy hour menu is great, but I would also recommend ordering off the full menu for more variety. Service was friendly and pretty attentive for a busy night."
,,,,,"Enjoyed an indulgent, snacky, potato-heavy meal delivered from Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba during my last visit to Chicago. My daughter and I split Garlic Potato Salad; Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli; Brussels Sprouts Salad with Marcona Almond, Manchego Cheese (for balance, lol); Spinach & Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce. I had the Iberia Ham Croquetas all to myself. While it wasn't the healthiest dinner I've ever had, everything was very tasty and well made. Brussels sprouts salad is new find for me - I really hate the taste of cooked Brussels sprouts, but raw and cut up thin for a salad - delicious! This is fun food. Side note, we had one small issue which management was very gracious about and fixed right away."
,,,,,"Came here for New years eve, & sat outside in their closed patio. We didn't feel cold at all, they did a really good job with the space. The service was good & food came out quickly. We got the passion fruit sangria & that is delicious. I'm obsessed with it, we got one to go. Definitely recommend getting it if you are order out, for a little drink at home. The food here exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting too much, but everything was cooked well & delicious. Oddly my least favorite was their seafood items. Our whole party agreed it was a good meal overall. Highly recommend this spot if you have been or just visiting."
,,,,,"Fun place, great vibe, good food! 5/5 for ambiance and the sangria, 3.5/5 for the tapas. The cava sangria (less sweet) and blood orange sangria (specialty sangria, very sweet) were both very unique and flavorful. The tapas were all good, just nothing that ""wowed"" us. Our favorite was the ham croquette with sherry aioli. The aioli was our favorite part of the whole meal- we even put it on the house made tomato bread to give it a little extra flavor. Also really liked the grilled pork with red chimichurri. Some of the pricier tapas that were ""just good"" were the wagyu beef carpaccio and grilled octopus."
,,,,,Favorite restaurant in Chicago. An absolute classic. 
,,,,,Great tapas and pintxos food. 
,,,,,Chorizo wrapped dates are to die for. 
,,,,,Stuffed mushrooms are phenomenal.
,,,,,Shrimp in garlic butter is wonderful. 
,,,,,Paella is good not great. 
,,,,,Sangria is amazing too. Slightly on sweet end for me but stiff flavorful and not overly sweet or fake tasting at all. 
,,,,,Great service- friendly and knowledgeable staff.
,,,,,This is probably my new favorite restaurant in the Lincoln Park area. It is always enjoyable to dine in around Armitage area. 
,,,,,"We went in Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for a Sunday brunch. We ordered the platter and two tapa dishes. The platter consisted of both sweet and savory bites of food. All of them were great, but personally I liked the toast the best. The tapa dishes were also very delicious. The Benedict egg with prosciutto were smooth and tasty, the potato was baked and spiced with a strong spicy flavor. The ""cubano"" sandwich were also delicious, the toasted bread with a mouthful of meat were very fulfilling."
,,,,,The service and the dining environment were also exceptional. I would definitely recommend it!
,,,,,"Love the name of this place. We went around 5:30PM on a weekend on a whim, and fortuitously caught the tail end of their Happy Hour (4-6pm daily). An excellent option if you never get out of work on time during weekdays to catch happy hour. The bar was packed, but we did manage to get a window seat. These are seats where the table flaps down from the window and you literally sit on a window sill (don't worry, there's a cushion there). The only thing is you either have to sit crosslegged in order to face the table or sit with your legs dangling off the windowsill and your body twisted around."
,,,,,"We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu with the exception of the potato salad. The red sangria ($20/pitcher) was decent, I like that it wasn't too sweet and was enough for 3 glasses per person. The stuffed olive and deviled egg were very tasty ($1.50 each). Our favorites from the rest of the happy hour menu were the tomato bread and tomato gazpacho soup. That soup is the most refreshing thing you've ever had. The tomato bread was also on point, would ask for extra tomato sauce next time. The bacon-wrapped dates (5/order) were also very tasty, but I'm just not much of a date person. Wagyu beef was good, but only 1 slice of beef over bread, most of the taste comes from the spread underneath. Meatballs good but rather tasteless without the tomato sauce. Overall, we very much liked this place and plan to come back often! Service is also very efficient, it was very easy to flag down a waiter to order more food."
,,,,,I've been here quite a few times in the past for both happy hour and regular restaurant dining. I haven't been back for awhile but my recent experience was quite different from what I remember and I walked out very disappointed. I went for happy hour on Thursday and sat at the bar. It was the menu that was disappointing; service was EXCELLENT! 
,,,,,We've ordered a variety from the happy hour menu.
,,,,,- Roast dates with bacon & Apple vinaigrette: $3.25 comes with 6 pieces. My favorite! We ordered 3 dishes of these. 
,,,,,"- Garlic potato salad $1.95 small portion! I remember happy hour size much bigger, but it came on a small plate. We ordered 3 of these. It tasted good & garlicky. "
,,,,,"- Spicy potatoes w tomato aioli $2.50 once again, small portion! I remember this being my favorite in the past, but not today. "
,,,,,"- Ibérico ham croquetas $2.95 unlike pictured on Yelp as sticks, it was 4 round balls. It was also soggy. I did not like it at all but I typically love croquetas. "
,,,,,- Handmade beef empanada $2.95 it was ok 
,,,,,"I remember all the pintxo used to be on the happy hour menu, but not anymore. "
,,,,,- Potato & omelette bite $1 pintxo too eggy for my taste
,,,,,- deviled egg $1 pintxo it was creamy & pretty good
,,,,,From regular menu
,,,,,#32 Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce $8.50 my second favorite- toast was perfect and who says no to goat cheese?
,,,,,"#50 beef tenderloin & blue cheese $11.50 comes with two meat ""balls"". Beef tenderloin was super soft, almost like ground beef texture. The flavor of blue cheese is very strong. Skip it!!"
,,,,,"#41 Catalan tomato bread with white anchovies $7.50 never had this at other tapas so I have nothing to compare it to, but it reminded me of bruschetta that I'd have it at other LEYE restaurants and made me wonder if they use the same tomato mix on the bread from Italian to this Spanish restaurant. "
,,,,,"#31 spinach & manchego stuffed mushroom $7.59 this,too, tastes like mushrooms from Maggianos"
,,,,,We got a pitcher of $14 red sangria. A pretty good deal for a large picture of Sangria. 
,,,,,My initial thought of this place has changed & had to now create a new memory.

,,,,,Absolutely delicious spot! The paella and bacon wrapped dates are by far my favorite dishes. Perfect for sharing and will have leftovers for sure!!
,,,,,Visiting Chicago again and met up with my daughter who goes to school in the city. She suggested Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba as she's been wanting to try their Paella for sometime and I'm always down for some tapas!
,,,,,"Food: We ordered a few tapas including the Grilled Squid, Octopus a la Plancha, Shrimp with Garlic followed by Seafood Paella. Of the tapas I enjoyed the Octopus the most as it was had nice grill marks and the tomato sauce was the perfect compliment. The shrimp was good with a generous portion in a slightly spicy sauce. The Paella was the star of the meal with a nice selection shrimp, squid, clams, and mussels to go with the perfectly cooked rice. They had a nice wine list and I was able to complement my meal with a wine flight of Spanish reds. "
,,,,,"Service: Great service from the time we entered. The restaurant was packed for a cold Monday evening but we  never felt neglected. Food came quickly, refilled our bread basket, and generally very attentive throughout."
,,,,,"Atmosphere: Great restaurant, much larger than I suspected when looking at the place from the outside. Several dining areas throughout the establishment allowing them to serve quite a large number of guests. Even with the crowd, the kitchen had no issue keeping up with our order. "
,,,,,"Value: Good value, tapas run between $6 - $15 each. Our three tapas, paella, and dessert was more than enough to satisfy our hunger. The paella is minimum two to order and takes about 30 minutes so place that first then order a few tapas to tide you over while you wait. Yelp Tip,  check in to unlock a free dessert tapas! "
,,,,,Overall: Loved Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for their food and service. I would love to come back and try more of their tapas in the future the next time I'm in the city!
,,,,,"Consistently good and consistently crowded, the pick up or delivery is close enough and delicious."
,,,,,"Some favorite tapas to share are the tortilla Espanol, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms with manchego cheese and spinach, meatballs and tomato bread. The single bite pintxos tapas are all great."
,,,,,"Save room for the paella, the market one with chicken and vegetables are a crowd pleaser. What's different are the sangria combinations, hard to go wrong with any one."
,,,,,"Agh second time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! and the food and service seemed very average to me. I went for Restaurant week brunch and the portions of some dish options were very small, food came out staggered which is fine for tapas but at the same time, some of our friends waited over 40min before eating! "
,,,,,I got the paella which was really good 5/5 and the Cubano which was 3/5. My friends also ordered the bacon Mac and cheeese which they loved and it was a large portion size. 
,,,,,"Overall, this place seems like a funn and easy weekend option but  food/service wise I wasn't impressed both times I came here."
,,,,,"Finally came in for a tapas brunch and ordered way too much food, all of it splendid!"
,,,,,"We had chorizo wrapped dates (how could we not), morcilla sausage, stuffed mushrooms, wagyu carpaccio, and the grilled octopus. All was so delicious, but the standouts were the carpaccio, of course, and the mushrooms. The wagyu was so smooth and buttery and paired really well with the cheese that came with, and the mushrooms were so flavorful and cooked to perfection. "
,,,,,"The octopus was probably the least successful thing for us, but we are also octopus fiends and order it whenever we see it, so we had a lot to compare to! It certainly wasn't bad, but not totally executed to the level of the mushrooms and carpaccio."
,,,,,"Also worth noting, the drinks are STRONG, so be prepared!"
,,,,,"The atmosphere is a little dark and a little noisy, but in a casual-intimate sort of way. "
,,,,,"Overall, had a great experience and will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"The love I have for Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is so real. I am all about trying new places, but for me it's not a trip to Chicago without a visit to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! I love meeting friends here because there is nothing quite as magical as sharing delicious tapas and pitchers of sangria with your pals. Their red sangria is my favorite that I've had in the US, and every tapa I've tried, I loved! "
,,,,,"On my most recent visit, I went for brunch for the first time, and it was fantastic! Seriously, brunch tapas is just  genius. We went with the jamón serrano eggs benedict (our favorite), sausage fried paella rice, the Cuban sandwich, shrimp & grits, and the chocolate waffle. Everything was absolutely delicious, and added to my love of this place even more! 15/10 recommend!"
,,,,,"What a great spot! In Covid times, I thought the restaurant handled precautions well. I did think the patio was more enclosed than I expected it to be. The roof is cracked but you are otherwise basically inside. It was very comfortable temperature wise though! The food was divine! We especially loved the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese tomato sauce. We also had an old fashioned and a sangria flight and I didn't think either was just out of this world impressive? I think that seems like an unpopular opinion "
,,,,," but they were good, just didn't leave an impression like the bacon wrapped dates did! Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely go back!"
,,,,,"Great atmosphere, the paella was amazing. Bacon dates were burnt tasting & oily! Other dishes were okay, but sangria & paella will make me good back again!"
,,,,,"Went to celebrate daughter's birthday. Server was great - circled favorite items on the menu as suggestions. Ordered nine different tapas - stuffed dates, spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, iberica ham & manchego cheese, grilled octopus, shrimp, burrata & avocado toast, octopus salad, steak skewers and goat cheese and tomato sauce, bacalado croquettes, and the seafood paella. "
,,,,,"All the tapas were fabulous. The grilled octopus was so incredibly tender and flavorful. Not to be out done, the steak skewers were perfectly done as well. "
,,,,,The paella was wonderful - plenty of seafood and rice soft but not mushy. Saffron not overpowering.
,,,,,Two pitchers of sangria - passion fruit and cava. I liked the passion fruit better. 
,,,,,"They didn't have dessert on the menu, but server came with flan with birthday candle. The flan was a  delectable combo between a tiramisu and traditional flan. "
,,,,,Great service - server even volunteered to take our picture. 
,,,,,Can't wait to go back.
,,,,,"Oh. My. God. This had to be my favorite restaurant while visiting Chicago. I NEED ONE IN LA! 5 stars for the food hands down. Little, almost EVERYTHING had me dancing in my seat and just rolling my eyes in pure food heaven pleasure.  Place was packed (and now I completely understand why) and just smelled amazing. I am so happy I had this place on my list and that I was able to eat here.  Definitely make reservations!!!!  But I would wait for the food either way haha."
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,* Burrata with Catalan Tomato Bread - OMG BURRRAATTA CHEEEESEE
,,,,,* Spinach and Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms - once you pop the fun don't stop.
,,,,,"* Brussels Sprouts Salad, Marcona Almonds, Manchego Cheese - YUM"
,,,,,"* Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes"
,,,,,"* Wagyu Beef Carpaccio on House Bread, Whipped Ricotta & Fresh Black Truffle - HOLY MOLY YOU GUYS THIS WAS THE BEST THING EVER"
,,,,,* Ibérico Ham Croquetas with Sherry Aioli

,,,,,* Natilla Flan
,,,,,* Marcona Almond Caramel Bar
,,,,,* Class Red Sangria
,,,,,* White Peach Sangria
,,,,,Seriously. Amazing. I must come back to completely destroy the rest of the menu.

,,,,,Their happy hours (every day from 4-6) are a steal! I highly recommend!
,,,,,I have beeen many times. Always great service food and atmosphere. A great Lettuce Entertsin You spot!
,,,,,"Always great food and service, par for the course with the Lettuce Entertain You franchise. I love all the small plates, brunch or dinner, and paella is amazing. Went for Galentine's Day for brunch and had a wonderful time."
,,,,,"Came here for dinner and had an amazing experience. We had garlic shrimp, ham croquetas,  brussels sprouts salad, hanger steak, grilled green peppers, stuffed mushrooms, spicy potatoes (and a few other things I can't remember). Everything tasted incredible, and the portions were perfect. It's easy to eat without being overly full, but if you want to be really full that is also very possible. We saw another table order paella and regretted not getting it after we saw it. They mix it at the table for you and it smelled really good. "
,,,,,Mango sangria was A+ I think that's all that needs to be said.
,,,,,"We got butterscotch flan, quite possibly the best flan I have ever had. It came in a tiny little cup with some whipped cream on top. Perfect size to finish off dinner and amazing butterscotch flavor. Could have ordered 10 more and eaten them all myself. "
,,,,,"The back of the restaurant is great for groups. Round tables which make for easy conversation, and the space is dark with soft lighting. Makes for a very warm and intimate space (only downside is that it is really loud, we went on a Thursday night). The bar has small tables by the window which are really cute for a good date spot. "
,,,,,"10/10 overall. Perfect for a date, night out with friends, dinner with parents, birthday dinner, etc. A fun but controlled atmosphere with great food and great staff. Could not recommend highly enough!!"
,,,,,An iconic Chicago restaurant! I've been here a couple times and have enjoyed my food and the service immensely. The food is great because you can order a couple different items and share them with your friends. I've not been disappointed by any of the brunch or dinner items I've had. Also they're sangria is the best! If you enjoy sangria you have to try theirs. Will definitely be back!
,,,,,I looove tapas and was visiting friends in Chicago and thought this would be a good place. Food was forgettable and prices were average. There's definitely better places to meet up w old friends when in Chicago
,,,,,I have been coming here for almost 30 years when they originally opened. This is the first time that I have done a yelp review for it.
,,,,,This is one place the Melmans got right!
,,,,,Not a lot has changed here since it open which is great because if it isn't broke don't fix it. I like bringing friends and family from out of town to visit this place as it is hard to come by some good long lasting tapas restaurants in the city and the suburbs.
,,,,,You cannot go wrong with most items on the menu however some favorites are the garlic shrimp the goat cheese in tomato sauce grilled octopus and of course anything with Jamon Serrano.
,,,,,It is very dark inside and quite noisy be prepared for that type of energetic loud vibe. Also be prepared that there is no street parking however there is a valet available.
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a classic that always hits the spot! My parents have been coming here for the past 30 years, and now I am joining in on the tradition. "
,,,,,"It is a tapas restaurant so I recommend getting a bunch of dishes to share, around 2-3 per person should be enough for a hearty meal. My favorites were the shaved brussel sprout salad, the patatas bravas, the calamari, and the buttermilk fried chicken thighs. I love that all the dishes are super flavorful and all very unique. "
,,,,,"The dishes that I did not love were the seared sausages and chicken and sausage. The sausages were too fatty for my liking, and the chicken and sausage dish came with the same sausage as the seared sausage dish so not worth getting both! However, there's plenty more options on the menu to try! Looking forward to trying the paella and one-bites (pinxtos) next time. "

,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! has been around since 1985, but my lovely wife and I dined here for the first time finally a few weeks ago.  This tapas restaurant is one of the longest-running establishments of the Lettuce Entertain You empire, with a massive interior that is subdivided into a bunch of more intimate spaces.  It can get loud in here, so we felt fortunate to get a somewhat secluded table in the corner of one of the dining rooms. "
,,,,,"We made reservations for the evening before Thanksgiving, and we were seated immediately even though we were about ten minutes early for the 6PM slot.  We chomped on fresh crusty bread with olive oil as we perused the extensive menu.  We went for the half-pitcher of The Classic White Sangria and it was refreshing.  Note that the sangria comes with paper straws, which may clog up with bits of fruit but work fine with a bit of maintenance.   "
,,,,,"We decided to go for the smaller tapas selections rather than ordering a massive pile of paella.  Our kind server was very patient with us during the ordering process, and we did go with some of her advice.  Everything was tasty, and to be honest I was surprised that we were filled up after ""only"" six tapas choices.  The citrus-cured salmon is a beautifully presented platter with cucumber, radish, crema, and toast.  I really liked the creamy texture of the Iberico ham croquetas, paired with a cup of sherry aioli for dipping.  We also enjoyed the garlic potato salad, mushrooms stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese, short rib with glazed carrots and mashed potatoes, and the special of the day empanada.  "
,,,,,"We used the Yelp check-in feature and were surprised to get a free dessert offer.  The extremely dense and rich triangles of chocolate cake with caramel drizzle and light dollop of cream were just the right size, and were a culinary exclamation point to complete a fabulous dinner at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!"

,,,,,"- Tomato bread: 5/5, delicious and the best way to start. Pro tip: we knew we wanted to get charcuterie and got a second order of tomato bread to pair with that"
,,,,,"- Chorizo-wrapped dates: 3.5/5, these were good, but I think bacon-wrapped just works better flavor wise. Also, we didn't realize that there is only 1 per order. "
,,,,,"- Patatas Bravas: 4/5, I order these at every tapas restaurant I go to. I loved the flavor of the aioli but it was super thick so you couldn't really dip the potatoes in so much as smear it on them. Also, it looked like someone had literally just thrown stuff together on a plate and brought it out. Overall though I would order and eat them again happily. "
,,,,,"- Grilled hanger steak: 3/5, good, nothing to write home about."
,,,,,"- Fried calamari: 5/5, delicious, loved the jalapeno aioli with it!"
,,,,,"- Iberico ham with manchego: 5/5, can't go wrong with this, deff order extra tomato bread for it and thank me later."
,,,,,"- Iberico ham croquetas: 5/5, these really surprised me, I thought they would be good but nothing special but I ended up loving them. "
,,,,,"I can see why this place is so highly recommended by everyone: great space, fun atmosphere, tasty (and strong!) drinks, and a delicious array of food. Impossible to go and not find at least 1 thing you like."
,,,,,My favorite restaurant in Chicago! I could live off the bacon-wrapped dates. Great place to go with a group and share some sangria for a fun night out!
,,,,,"Second time coming here since March 2020. The place is absolute amazing, the place is packed especially during Happy Hours (amazing Sangria), the service is excellent, the waiter was very friendly, and the food was excellent and delicious!!!"
,,,,,"I went here last Saturday for my sister's 30th birthday. This was my first time here and I gotta say the food here was excellent. The service was really good and our sever was very friendly. My favorite dish was the seafood paella and the bacon wrapped dates, which was far beyond amazing. I definitely will be coming back here again!"
,,,,,Been going there for over 30 years! Great food and service! I prefer the variety tapas style offers over large quantities of one dish.
,,,,,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is just a really fun, old-school tapas spot and is perfect for a boozy, weekend brunch in Lincoln Park. This spot has been around since the 80's, and the menu and vibe sort of reflect that in the best way- Ba-Ba-Reeba is not the place to go for the newest takes on Spanish cuisine, but is instead the place to go with friends for the old standards and a really fun time. We stopped in rather late on a Sunday afternoon, and were immediately seated on their beautiful covered atrium-style patio. We started with olives and an order of their ""crystal bread""- their take on pan con tomate- which was delicious and topped with generous slices of salty manchego. We also had a small cup of their really fresh and clean gazpacho, which was a great way to start the meal. From there, we had the Brussels sprout salad, studded with almonds and manchego, which really might have been the surprising standout. It was seriously really good, and hard not to get another order. We paired that with the patatas bravas, served with a big splat of paprika aioli, and their rich and creamy goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, served alongside garlic bread. While the food was delicious, the sangria really stole the show. We went with a pitcher of the cava sangria- sparkling white flavored with Spanish liquer and creme de cassis. It was fantastic, sweet, alcoholic and almost creamy, and I would be remiss to say it might be the best sangria I have ever had. The vibe was also fantastic- convivial and fun, with light pouring in from the sun roof. You can really tell that this institution is the place to come to celebrate. All in all, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a wonderful brunch spot, and is a new addition to my list of Chicago favorites."
,,,,,One of the best restaurants in the area! Make sure you show up for happy hour and sit in the bar area for $20 pitchers of Sangria. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.

,,,,,Love this tapas place! Very cute and romantic dining setting. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The portions are enough for 3 people to share.
,,,,,"Did I mention I love tapas? Ba-Ba-Reeba has a great menu, knowledge staff and great sangria. I love the decor and only sad when we can't get reservations. Looking forward to my next visit!"
,,,,,"On a roll lately, one restaurant is better than the next. "
,,,,,"Loved the cozy atmosphere here, and the service was the best. "
,,,,,"We enjoyed the tapas, which allowed us to try several items. "
,,,,,The Brussel sprout salad was very tasty. The potato onion dish was equally good. 
,,,,,"I cannot do gluten, but my daughter had the avocado toast. It looked wonderful and she said it was delicious."
,,,,,We will definitely be adding this to our list of go to restaurants in the Lincoln Park area!
,,,,,"I've been to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba for years and love my in person experience - such a fun space and amazing food for tapas. My go-to's are the: seafood paella, garlic shrimp (so tangy and savory), bacon wrapped dates (MUST ORDER), smoked ham, smoked salmon, beef empanadas, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce with garlic bread (MUST GET!!), patatas bravas (crispy potatoes that taste exactly like the ones you get in Spain and the spicy aioli is to die for!!) and any of the sangrias! "
,,,,,"It's a great place for a large group and for sharing so many delicious foods. The atmosphere is also very lovely and the service has always been great. However, recently we ordered delivery and the portions were so tiny! The beef tenderloin with blue cheese only included two tiny pieces of beef and the fried chicken thighs had only 5 small pieces. The food was still very delicious but the portion-sizes were very disappointing given how much delivery costed."
,,,,,"The beef tenderloin and blue cheese is a lovely invention. It's so delectable, juicy and tender and the cheese perfectly complements. I found out my order with the Brussels sprout salad which is tasty with nutty and cheesy notes as well. Haven't gotten to try the sangria as it has been a pandemic and ordering exclusively take out so far but looking forward to trying that in the spring."
,,,,,"This place has become a staple for me to bring out of town guests. It's always fun sharing all the small bites and pitcher(sss) of sangria. I could eat the spicy potatoes as my whole meal, but I couldn't pass up on the Brussels sprouts salad. The chorizo wrapped dates are a classic, and if you like goat cheese, I highly recommend the tomato and goat cheese. This place is great for sharing but if you want to order your own things, that's fine too! White sangria is a must. It's definitely sweet like sangria, but I hate sweet cocktails and could probably down a pitcher of this by myself."
,,,,,"I got together with coworkers (meeting in person for the first time!) here and we had such a great experience. The Sangria was flowing, the tapas were delicious and perfect for sharing/eating multiple courses spread out, and it was a great atmosphere! Our waiter Tim was awesome and always made sure we were taken care of without being overbearing. I will definitely be returning! Highly recommend the chorizo wrapped dates, Brussels sprouts salad, and spicy potatoes! Plus the sangria (duh)"
,,,,,"I can't give this place more than 2 stars. They claim to have authentic Spanish tapas. Have they been to Spain, because it seems like they have not? Some of their tapas are named correctly, but just not very good, others are just not accurate at all. I get it, the Lettuce Entertain You, strip on Halstead is geared towards upper middle class folks who want to live in the city, pretend to be cultured, but want the comfort of a suburban chain restaurant. I've been to Summer House, Stella Barra (when it was open), Crab Cellar and now Cafe ba-ba-Reba and I can honestly say, that I won't be back to any of them. Their wine menu was super expensive - $19 for a glass of wine? At that price I expect quality, which I did not get. Take this review for what you will, it is my opinion however, if you want authentic Spanish food this is not the place for you."
,,,,,"I am from a long line of Spanish people and have spent a lot of my life eating Spanish food, and let me tell you, this place is the best tapas place I've had outside of the ""homeland""!  Literally writing this review right now is making my mouth water (and I just finished eating). This food is as great as my abuelita would make, but make it trendier. "
,,,,,"The carpaccio, spicy potatoes, and green peppers were amazing! The sauces on all these dishes take it from traditional to the next level of delicious. Octopus and croquetas have always been my favorite growing up. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint! Do NOT skip on the sangria. We got a pitcher of the special lychee sangria and wow. Also it was 6 drinks for $30 - talk about value! "
,,,,,"If you're in Chicago, this is a must visit place!"
,,,,,Loved my experience here!
,,,,,The best sangria I've had in a while and I've had a lot of them! 
,,,,,Definitely try the mango sangria!
,,,,,"My friends and I got the potato bravas, the Brussel sprout salad ( coz  balance), garlic shrimp, fried chicken. Delicious food and a very lively ambience."
,,,,,"Our server forgot our paella order but it was for the better since we were full, so we were okay with not trying it. "
,,,,,They offered us a complimentary dessert.
,,,,,It is priced well too.

,,,,,Wonderful dinning experience here. Made dine in reservations and was able to sit in the bar area. Happy hour specials only available at the bar area. Service was quick and portions were expertly priced. Was able to try over 6 dishes for a reasonable amount. Potatoes were seasoned perfectly and paired well with the aioli. Wagyu Beef melts in your mouth. Soft burrata bread with hits of spicy from the peppers made this dish. Couldn't beat the beer and sangria prices for happy hour. Will definitely be coming back in the near future.
,,,,,Great environment and great food! Always fun bringing out of town guests as it is more of a unique experience. Their sangria is great!
,,,,,"I went here, and I got a number of their tapas and the red sangria. The sangria was really good as were their tapas. I would definitely go again. We got the patatas bravas, calamari, and the Brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts and calamari were my favorite. For dessert we got the flan, which I would definitely get again. The environment was really nice. They had windows open for covid, so it was a little cold in there. We felt well spaced from the other tables. The service was good and timely."
,,,,,"This restaurant is lively and fun, with high quality food. "
,,,,,"We ordered the Chorizo-Wrapped Dates, Deviled Eggs, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli (big serving! spicy!), Beef Skewer, Caramelized Red Onion & Horseradish Cream, Grilled Ibérico Pork with Red Chimichurri, and Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce (good; filling for sure)."
,,,,,"We loved nearly everything, Chorizo-wrapped dates, Beef Skewer, and Deviled eggs were probably our top three if we are forced to choose. The only ""meh"" item was the Grilled Pork - we wouldn't get that again, as it was pretty bland and tough. "
,,,,,"We loved that many of the items you could order by the piece, so we could order just a few so we could try more items, etc. It was fantastic!"
,,,,,*We brought our 8 and 10 year old boys and they loved it. They tried everything and wanted more of all of it! We can't wait to go back!
,,,,,This place is incredible. I think we got 10 dishes and literally every single one was great. The place is huge and they do a nice job of spacing the tables out so you don't feel to close to anyone. Our servers were super friendly and very attentive. Cannot say enough nice things about the food. The best we've had in Chicago by far! I could literally eat 30 of the chorizo wrapped dates. Highly recommend!
,,,,,"Ba-Ba-Reeba is my favorite Lettuce Entertain You spot.  Typically, I think the LEY spots are a little corporate - a restaurant that is run really well, great service, but good not great food.  Ba-Ba-Reeba holds up the first two, but exceeded expectations on the food piece.  "
,,,,,"The ambiance is nice.  It feels Spanish, which is obviously what they were going for, and it's on Halsted in Lincoln Park.  A cool area."
,,,,,"This is a tapas restaurant through and through, but the star of the show for me is the paella.  I've ordered a couple different paellas, and they have all been tremendous.  You have to order it.  Some other recommendatons: waffle-battered chicken stick (brunch), brussel sprout salad, and the chroizo wrapped date from the pintxos menu."
,,,,,I've been fully enjoying their happy hour and their tapas are for sure the best in the city. Couldn't find any other Sapin restaurant in the city that well.
,,,,,"Heard so many amazing things about this place, and it definitely lives up to the hype! I came for happy hour on a weekday and was seated immediately. They have distanced indoor seating available during COVID. The bar area is dimly lit but has a cozy, intimate feel. The staff were very friendly and gave great recommendations! My only complaint is that the dishes are on the pricier side but more reasonable at happy hour."
,,,,,"The roasted dates, carpaccio toast, and croquetas were my favorites and I would definitely get them again! The dates were the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Wagyu carpaccio and ricotta just melted in my mouth. The croquetas were little nuggets of crunchiness smoothed out with savory aioli. "
,,,,,I didn't get to try their sangria this time (had work afterwards) but will try it next time when I come back to sample the rest of the happy hour menu!
,,,,,"I ate too much here.  It's a tapas restaurant, so a friend pretty much ordered half the menu items on the menu for all of us to sample.  We ordered a pitcher of the sangria, so if you like sangria, order it!  We ordered beef empanadas, bacon wrapped dates(my favorite), deviled egg, goat cheese in tomato sauce, and chicken empanada.  My top favorites were the bacon wrapped dates, beef empanadas and deviled egg.  They were just enough to sample, and the sangria was pretty tasty. I will have to try to paella next time I'm in town, it looked fantastic at the table next to us.  No pictures because my phone had died."
,,,,,Absolutely delicious!! I've heard great things about this place and was excited to try it! We started with the Black Rasberry Sangria and the housemade tomato bread. Sangria was honestly the best I've ever had anywhere. 
,,,,,"We split the chicken paella 3 ways but you probably could've split it between 4 people. We also ordered spicy potatoes with tomato aioli as our tapas and it was delicious. All the food was great, very fresh and is delivered to you as it is prepared so you eat in waves. Service was great and atmosphere was enjoyable."

,,,,,"Been craving this place for a while now and we finally stopped in. I wish we were here with more people to allow for more foods to try but was satisfied with the chicken paella and Brussels sprout salad! The rice is so crispy with chicken and cauliflower. Some onion, green peppers and a light oil also in the paella! Can't say enough amazing things about the Brussel sprout salad. Fresh, cheesie, crunchy nuts and sprouts, coated in a creamy dressing. "
,,,,,"Menu is digital, tables are spaced, and masks are required with temperature checks. They are doing a great job with precautions and food! Just recognize they are adding 4% to the bill to cover these extra items."
,,,,,"Good portions where you can try different items.  We had the Mushroom, the potatoes, goat cheese and tomato dip, and the shrimp. The shrimp was meh.  Not the best meal that I have ever had, but good.  Do not get the mineral water, it tastes like a coin was marinating in the water for days. Not refreshing."
,,,,,Well worth the hype! This tapas restaurant far surpassed my expectations. They have a diverse menu with options for everyone at the table. Here are some of my favorites from the night:
,,,,,"Bacon wrapped dates - I'm not usually a fan of bacon wrapped dates but these definitely changed my mind. The dates were small and sweet, balanced perfectly with the salty bacon. I could have easily eaten the whole dish myself!"
,,,,,"Hawaiian short ribs (special of the day) - This dish is not on the menu, it just happened to be the special of the day. But it should become a regular menu item, it was that good! The short ribs were EXTREMELY tender. Paired with creamy mashed potatoes, this dish was perfection."
,,,,,Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms - These mushrooms were packed with flavor. The manchego cheese is really the star of this dish. Lets just say it had members of my party licking it off the plate.
,,,,,"The other dishes we got were the tomato bread, garlic shrimp, meatballs, chicken paella, flan, and chocolate truffle cake. Though the dishes above were my favorite, everything I ate that night was very good. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I honestly have no complaints. This restaurant has resoundingly made it onto our list to return to!"
,,,,,"Visited Cafe Ba Ba Reeba when I stopped by Chicago for the weekend. This restaurant is a tapas style restaurant, food served fresh is small sharing portions!"
,,,,,"There is no parking lot, but plenty of street parking if you're patient enough to arrive a bit earlier to find any :)"
,,,,,I really appreciated how quickly all the dishes were served. The menu does give very good suggestions where those in red are their popular dishes and I can see why. My table ordered 2 shrimps because they were that good! The octopus was perfect as well! The paella was the biggest thing we ordered that day! It was a bit crunchy but oh so filling!
,,,,,"If you're feeling hungry in between, no worries! Get yourself an order of that garlic bread :)"
,,,,,"Overall, it was a great experience, I would love to come back and try to get seats on the brick wall side because its super pretty. The food once again, served very very quickly and super fresh. Highly recommend anything they suggest on the menu ;)"
,,,,,Ok hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A must try. 
,,,,,"First of all, the restaurant has a great COVID protocol. They scan your temp when you walk in, masks on everytime someone comes by the table, and the tables are pretty spaced out. "
,,,,,Food wise - delicious. Hands down delicious. 
,,,,,"We had the lychee sangria - so good! Literally tastes like juice. For our tapas, we had the waffle battered chicken (amazing), the garlic shrimp (pretty decent), chorizo wrapped date (AMAZING MUST HAVE), wagyu carpaccio (pretty good), and stuffed mushrooms (so good). Honestly can't wait until I can go back."
,,,,,"I've been here twice for dates but was most recently here for a Sunday brunch when I heard Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was participating in restaurant week. The pre-set menu lets you choose from a glass of red or white sangria, 2 brunch tapas, and 1 dessert tapas, all for the unbelievably low price of $25. I came with a friend so we were able to explore the menu. "
,,,,,"You can never go wrong with sangria and both their red and white are great. We did order the housemade tomato bread off the regular menu to start with. The tomato puree they use as the spread is salted perfectly and pairs with their bread really well. For tapas, we got the following:"
,,,,,Bacon Mac 'n Cheese - we got this without the bacon but it was easily my favorite dish because it was SO creamy
,,,,,Brunch Bravas - came a bit more on the burnt side but the aioli was to die for
,,,,,Avocado & Egg Toast - this was a really nice dish to share and very filling
,,,,,"Jamon Serrano Eggs Benedict - got this sans jamon, still good and enjoyed the hollandaise"
,,,,,"Chocolate Truffle Cake - honestly 10 stars, this was SO rich and decadent"
,,,,,"Natilla Flan - liked this as well, a great dish to end the brunch"
,,,,,This brunch was excellent and I would easily come here again for tapas. Would recommend!
,,,,,"I have nothing but good words for this place. The ambience, staff, food, drinks, decor.. everything is of quality. Easily one of my favorite spots in Chicago. If you're on the fence about coming here, don't be. Call up some friends, head over to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, grab a menu, close your eyes, pick 15 random things, order a seasonal sangria flavor, and have an amazing experience. "
,,,,,"I think Ive had most of the menu. Nothing is bad. Just try it all. If I had to pick, I'd suggest a paella, any of empanadas, and the bacon wrapped dates."
,,,,,I just love Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. It reminds me of my time in Spain and I always feel such a welcoming vibe from this place. Wait staff is always happy to serve and I can tell they are treated well. I love the variety of dishes and the sangria flight is a must to try the new seasonal flavors each time I go.
,,,,,"Never disappointed me, reserved for 2 at beginning, and comes with 4 finally. Everything was perfect expect the paella. Two orders of each: Hanger steak and roasted squid... sooo good"
,,,,,"It's a place which I came with my best friend few yrs ago, now I'm the on who bring more friends"
,,,,,"Sangria flights and red/white wine flights!! The sangria flight consisted of classic red, white peach, black raspberry, and passion fruit. Stuffed mushrooms were the star of the food show - great texture, not too watery and not too mushy. The poached egg on the beef tenderloin eggs Benedict was a little underdone. I'm not a fan of runny whites. The onions and horseradish cream sauce that come with the beef skewer were delicious."

,,,,,Tried the happy hour for the first time and it does not disappoint.   The sangria was better than expected. Everything we had was tasty l.  Will be back.
,,,,,This is a great place for tapas! We got the white wine sangria (mango and white peach) which were both good but definitely liked the white peach better!
,,,,,"For tapas, we got the chorizo wrapped date which was such a good combination of sweet and savory and had to add some more to our order! The brussel sprout salad also had a great flavor and was decently sized for a tapa. The goat cheese in tomato sauce with garlic bread was a great flavor as well and the bread was nice and crunchy. The grilled iberico pork was a little bit burnt in places but had a nice flavor and wasnt too hard to chew. "
,,,,,Really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back for more tapas!
,,,,,We popped by in the fall I think for Lettuce Entertain You Week (excellent idea by the way).  Loved the suggestion by staff members to combine our prix fixe menu entrees to get paella.  I'd never had it before!  Such a good decision; we had leftovers!  
,,,,,Boyfriend still (months later) talks about the chocolate truffle dessert we had.  Found out I can get it by the piece for about $2.50/each.  It's VERY tasty!

,,,,,Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is a favorite of me and my friends. Very affordable and tasty food. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. I love their tomato goat cheese dip and patatas bravas. Their paella is great. Always happy every time I visit.
,,,,,"I finally got around going to check this place out, and it was definitely worth the wait! 10/10 recommend!"
,,,,,"They have a beautiful section that turns into a patio which we got to enjoy now that the weather is getting nice. We had the seasonal sangria which was pineapple. I loved that it was not too sweet ,it was the perfect combination! We had tomato bread, papas bravas, croquetas , and my personal favorite the bacon wrapped dates and the calamari! Order a couple items and share them amongst your party. Great way to try a little of everything. Can't wait to go back!"

,,,,,"Tapas are meant to be shared in a group with good conversation so it was off putting when we were reminded several times that we had 90 minutes once we were seated on a weeknight with empty tables around us.  The service was otherwise fine.  The best dishes of the evening were goat cheese in tomato sauce and burrata avocado toast.  The goat cheese came with very buttery garlic bread for dipping.  The paella was disappointing with burnt bottom and tiny pieces of seafood.  Several more tapas and 2 pitchers of sangria later, the 5 of us still had 17 minutes left on the Hand-Over-Your-Money and Leave meter.  Ok food but not an enjoyable meal."
,,,,,"Cool, city vibe. Informative, attentive service. We had 10 plates between the 3 of us, and 2 of us were very hungry...it was just enough. "
,,,,,"Do's: Sangria, croquettes, beef skewer, octopus (some of the best we've had, and we've had a seafull), olives, monchego mushrooms."
,,,,,"Not so much: undercooked goat cheese, over sauced hangar steak (onions that came with it were great), bacon wrapped dates and just so-so patatas braves."
,,,,,Hell no: piri-piri fried chicken thighs that they must buy from Popeyes and over-soak in sauce. 
,,,,,"Overall, a great place to dine. Deduct a star for a couple just okay plates."
,,,,,"Came here to catch up with some out of town friends. Hadn't been here in 6 years and I think the food has gotten better. The place is also spacious. I will note that they space their reservations 90 minutes apart and will ask you to leave to seat other patrons. Overall, food, service, and ambiance were great. Desserts didn't really shine. I want to come back for the paella. Sadly wasn't drinking this time, but their drink selection and sangria is great!"
,,,,,Brussel Sprout Salad - large portion and so many good flavors with the cheese and nuts. The texture is also nice with the crunch of the Brussels sprout
,,,,,"Chocolate Truffle Cake - very dense and decadent. Looks like a cake, tastes like a truffle. Would be awesome with coffee"
,,,,,Fried Calamari - some of the best calamari I have had. Light on the breading but it is seasoned so well. Calamari tastes super fresh
,,,,,Garlic Shrimp - pretty standard. I've had shrimped cooked better. Might have been overcooked actually. Didn't get a ton of garlic or butter flavor
,,,,,"Patatas Bravas - was skeptical since I thought they were kind of bland last time, but these were super flavorful and crispy. And the spicy seasoning paired nicely with the creamy aioli "
,,,,,Chicken skewer - pretty standard. You only get one skewer
,,,,,Iberico ham board - loved this. The bruschetta was the perfect vehicle for the salty ham and Parmesan. Olives were really tasty
,,,,,Butterscotch custard - more solid than a pudding. Nice and salty. A-ok.
,,,,,Cinnamon flan - I had homemade flan the day before and this just didn't compare. It was eggy and a little too solid. Cinnamon brought out the egg flavors more.

,,,,,This was the first Tapas restaurant I went to and I loved it all!! The food was delicious. My friend and I ordered several tapas and a sangria pitcher (so so good!). The potatoes were addicting- don't leave without trying these. And I couldn't get enough of the spicy tomato aioli sauce. I strongly recommend this place and can't wait to go back and try more tapas!

It was dark and romantic in there, still casual that we felt right at home. We were taken back to one of the many dinning room areas and had a corner table (perfect for people watching). We started out with the croquette! So yummy we hadn't had croquettes since we lived in LA and I think we may have found our new spot for them. Out of the 6 tapas we tried what we decided were must haves were: the croquette, patatas bravas, and the empanada. We realized after we had ordered that we had some regret not going ahead and ordering a Paella as well. The tables around us had some and they looked delicious! Just keep in mind it takes 40 minutes to make! The only downside for us in particular was we were a little cold and needed our jackets for the meal. Otherwise the service was great, the food was great, and we will be coming back for a Paella very soon,"
,,,,,Holy cow - I've always been a Ba Ba fan but for some reason never reviewed....
,,,,,"What prompted me to review was the fact that I begrudgingly ordered delivery recently.  I say begrudgingly because while I love their food, I questioned if tapas would deliver well. The way they pack their food and the containers they use, coupled with a QUICK delivery worked super well!"

,,,,,Really good Tapas. Awesome atmosphere- there's a cool open space on the side. The bacon dates are tasty as well as the deviled eggs.

,,,,,"The service was attentive and aimed to please. Overall, this is a great place for pretty much any occasion or non-occasion. I can see how this place can get busy. The space is big with nice décor and great food and service."
,,,,,"Tapas and happy hour sangria! This is my go-to place! It can get really crowded because of how popular this place is, but the food is well worth the wait. I've come here for years and never been disappointed. This is also a place I take almost every friend or family member that visits Chicago. Sharing their tapas is a great time and I always order a pitcher of sangria!"
,,,,,"Love coming to this place and getting their red sangria! Came with my best friends and luckily found a reservation at 6pm last minute. They get booked really quickly so plan ahead of time! I ordered off the restaurant week menu and ordered the seared morcilla sausage, deviled egg, roasted bacon wrapped dates, grilled iberico pork, and butterscotch custard. All of the food we ordered came at different times which got a little confusing, but the food was still delicious. I highly recommend trying their grilled iberico pork with red chimichurri sauce! The total of the bill including tip & tax was $173. You are also only allowed to stay for a little over an hour to dine which can feel a little rushed. But overall had a great time as usual with their amazing drinks and food."
,,,,,"Haven't been here in so long and I'm glad I came back to check out their restaurant week! My family friend and I were able to get seated right away and earlier than our reservation time which was kind of them to accommodate. Our server was great, informative, prompt, and humorous throughout our dinner. The restaurant week provides you a 3 course meal with a sangria pairing which their red sangria is the most authentic sangria I've tried yet! I ordered my choice of pintxo, the house charcuterie plate, grilled iberico pork, and the marcona almond-caramel bar. Our pintxo and appetizers came out very quickly! My friend got the bacon wrapped dates which I highly recommend - they were amazing! Unfortunately we did have to wait a little for our entrees, but the quality of the food was worth the wait. My pork didn't come with a side which I was surprised about, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the texture of it. The almond caramel bar was also a really good dessert and a great finish to the dinner. Overall paid ~$47 including tax and tip for a tasty dinner!"
,,,,,Gave it four stars the first time around but I came for restaurant week and it was SO GOOD. Our waiter was very kind and accommodated a vegan restaurant week menu. I got the white sangria (my fiends got red) and it was great. Then I got house bread and the spicy roasted potatoes without aioli. Then main was the moroccan chickpeas followed by pear sorbet for dessert. SUPER yummy and great experience.
,,,,,Top level: food is good but perhaps a little overrated? I'm vegan though 
,,,,,"so I made a reservation weeks ago and at that time, only the patio was open. However, I was informed that you cannot only make a res for the patio and that you can only wait 30 minutes or you had to be seated inside. No body in my party was comfortable being seated inside and I think this communication error impacted our dinner. We waited for an extra 20 past our res. I will also note that not the entire patio is completely open - I would not be comfortable siting further in the patio that is enclosed. However, we were seated at a very open table and were able to order food."
,,,,,"I tried the patatas bravas, peach sangria, house bread, and vegetable paella. I like the paella the best and the sangria was delicious. the house bread was also tasty with a tomato sauce on top. the potatoes - didn't stand out as incredible but were definitely crispy and nice. "

Feel free to sit at the bar, random stools not connected to the bar, or in little cubbies that used to be windows for a totally comfortable eating experience. My cultured lady friend said that's just the way they do it in espana. Food is tapas style which translates to English as not enough to satiate. They will change the TV at the bar to the sports game of your request, whether that game is Auburn vs Alabama or Western Kentucky vs Marshall. It's rivalry week people!!!"
,,,,,5 stars
,,,,,"Visited for the first time last night and absolutely loved everything, we can't wait to go back! Though I may be biased because I love this style of eating, their tapas options are superb. We ordered a wide variety, pictured below, but our favorites were the Beef Empanada, Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce, and Chorizo wrapped dates. We also tried a pitcher of each, the Classic Red & White Sangria, and I preferred the white while my girlfriend and our friend liked the red. In my opinion, this place is perfect for a date night or a small group gathering to enjoy some conversation and Sangria while different plates come scattered throughout your stay. To add, the prices are very good for the quality of food you're experiencing. I definitely recommend this spot!"
,,,,,"Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is the perfect place to go with a group! The sangria is so fun and yummy and the tapas are delicious. It isn't ""blow your mind"" level of food, but it is delicious and so fun."
,,,,,Great ambiance for a date or a girls night. Really anything! The food was amazing. I was so stuffed after the meal because I wanted to try everything. And the sangria was great as well!
,,,,,"Just finished brunch here. Tried a number of different items and unfortunately was very unimpressed with the flavor of everything. Got the avocado toast and you could tell the avocado was not fresh - when the waitress came back she stated that ""well we make it with lime and that might be it"". Big fan of lime in my avocado - along with other things but you can tell when an avocado is fresh. The waitress pretty much avoided us the rest of the time we were there. Overall disappointed. I literally never review places but feel like I needed to. Blah."
,,,,,"Literally amazing! I love tapas, and this restaurant is one of the best. On my trip to Chicago this made my last night so memorable. Don't forget to try the patatas bravas!"
,,,,,"Let's talk tapas! I've heard of this place many times but just haven't had a chance to visit it for myself. My brother and sister- in- law invited us for dinner on a Sunday night at 7:00. They made reservations but we asked if it could be pushed back to 6:00 but Café Ba-Ba-Reeba said they were completely booked. At first, I was like booked for a Sunday, what? But once I arrived, I realized why they were so slammed- the food is delicious. But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the accessibility of the place. Located in the"
,,,,,"heart of Lincoln Park so there is plenty of public transit (trains and buses) and there is also street parking and if you are lucky, you'll find parking right away. But if you are like us and always running fashionably late, you may park a couple of blocks away haha (just"
,,,,,"kidding). Just a side note- you do not have to pay for Chicago Street parking on Sunday in this area. Anyways, I thought for sure we would wait long to be seated because the place was slammed. But then the host advised us to follow her and we were immediately seated. This place is like a maze, with so different sections. The waiter greeted us almost immediately and listed out the drink specials for the evening. There are no menus, you basically just use your phone to ""take a picture"" and then the menu appears. There is so much selection to choose from but my husband and I chose the Brussel sprouts salad with marcona almonds and Manchego, two orders of the peri- peri chicken, an order of the grilled hanger steak, shrimp with garlic,"
,,,,,"olive oil and red pepper flakes and the handmade beef empanada. Holy smokes- the peri peri chicken is out of this world. The chicken meat itself melts in your mouth because of how well cooked it is and then the sauce, omgosh, you have NO self- control. Our table had five total orders of the peri- peri chicken, that should tell you something. Not to mention, it was gone in a matter of minutes. The salad was okay- nothing out of this world but it was among the ""healthiest"" guilt free"
,,,,,option I could order to justify the calories of everything else I ate haha. The beef empanada was delicious and I was so sad when I got to my last bite. The dough of the empanada was really soft not to mention
,,,,,"how delicious the actually stuffing is. If you're not hungry by now, you will be shortly when I tell you how delicious the hanger steak is. Small serving so please keep in mind you're not getting a five meal course but man, the flavoring takes you out of this world!! Highly"
,,,,,"recommend trying it. With tapas, there is a great deal of selection but the most disappointing of them was the garlic shrimp. I am a HUGE garlic shrimp fan but this did not cut it at all. Again, tapas is small serving so got five pieces of garlic but it was almost watered down, like there was not a rich taste of olive oil and garlic. I don't know, it was different but not a good different. Please  keep in mind, this is merely my opinion based off of my love for garlic, to others this may be delicious so try it for yourself. Ironically enough, only took a picture of the garlic because nothing else stood a chance for a picture haha. For dessert we had flan, pineapple sorbet and chocolate cake. Let me tell you, ALLL AMAZING. Can't go wrong with any of them! The waiter was nice too and the bus boys were on top of their game- there was not an empty dish in sight on their watch. So pleased with"
,,,,,the service and food. 9/10 highly recommend!
,,,,,-Great Spanish Tapas!
,,,,,"-Highly recommend the tomato bread, patatas bravas, and croquetas. Sangria is delicious as well!"
,,,,,-Awesome service. Temperature taken at entrance. Other COVID precautions in place. The space is quite large and felt that we were well distanced from others.
,,,,,"-Really reasonable price for tapas, especially if you order with a group of at least 3-4 people."
,,,,,-Will be coming back to try more of the menu in the future!
,,,,,Tasty tasty.
,,,,,Heard about this place from a close friend and decided to check it out. Definitely don't regret coming here. My friend and I happened to arrive during happy hour so we sat by the bar. Happy hour options are more limited.  Pitcher of red sangria is $20. 
,,,,,"I heard a lot about the white peach sangria so I had to order one. SO GOOD ITS DANGEROUS. I recommend this drink 100%. Smooth, sweet, and tangy. "
,,,,,"For tapas, we ordered quite a few including the Garlic Potato Salad, Sweet Potato & Coconut Soup with Espelette, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli, Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Crudo + Jalapeño Aioli, Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes, and Housemade Tomato Bread. "
,,,,,"I throughly enjoyed each and every tapa option. However, my favorites were Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli and the Shrimp with Garlic+Olive Oil+Red Pepper Flakes. These two are a must. Potatoes were perfectly crisp. The aioli was heavenly. Not too spicy, just the right kick. Shrimps were perfectly cooked. The garlic sauce was amazing. Not too overpowering. "
,,,,,I also really enjoyed the tomato bread. Flavor was pretty unique. Freshly baked. 
,,,,,No complaints here. I just recommended it to a close friend to celebrate her birthday!
,,,,,"I love cafe babareeba for their atmosphere and food.  Their tapas are generally good but it really depends on what you get. Personally, their paella and meatballs were flavorful but a bit salty. We absolutely love their chicken empanadas and deviled eggs. Their SANGRIA is amazing -- you can choose from flavors such as passion fruit, white peach, and black raspberry. Currently they have Mango sangria as their seasonal sangria (I think) and it's soo yummy!"

,,,,,"What a great place! Really enjoyed the chorizo-wrapped dates, french toast, and the waffle fries chicken in particular! All to die for! The paella was tasty and a fun table-side order. Honestly it could be the entire meal for two people. Really enjoyed our brunch, and highly recommend!"
,,,,,"I've been to Café Babareeba a few times now with different friends, and we never walk away disappointed. If you ask me what my favorite restaurant in Chicago is, this is usually up there on the list!"
,,,,,"Unlike other tapas places I've been to in the city, Café Babareeba is decently priced for its portion sizes. I usually feel that tapas can rack up quite a bill as you're sharing the small plates with friends, but Café Babareeba is always well-priced and delicious."
,,,,,"My go-to favorites here are the potatoes and the wrapped dates. There's always enough on the small plate for everyone, and you can probably feel decently full from these two alone. The bacon wrapped dates have a very sweet date in the middle wrapped by strong, smoky bacon, all drenched in a juicy sauce. You can never have just one bite! However, if you need a bit of vegetables or something more refreshing, I would also recommended the brussels sprout salad."
,,,,,"I also really enjoy the environment at Café Babareeba. It can both be a casual place to catch up with friends, or a beautiful date night evening. The décor is well thought out and it almost feels like you're in different worlds based of which part of the restaurant you sit in. Sometimes you can even catch customers seated and dining on cushions on the window panes as you walk into the entrance!"
,,,,,"Nice for a girls night when you need some Sangria and Tapas! Everything is shareable, so go with a group to share/taste test with! Sangria is delicious and not too heavy."
,,,,,Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.
,,,,,The ambience is nice: I really enjoyed the mood lighting and the overall theme.
,,,,,"Service stellar: we somehow nabbed a few cushioned window seats (neat idea, by the way) near the bar during peak dining hours, and asked to move to a proper bar table without any difficulty."
,,,,,"Food: Some of the entrees were slightly salty to my taste; nothing a bit of cocktail couldn't take care of. Tomato bread was a bit soggy when it came out, would have preferred it to have a crispy layer. Overall, every dish had very good flavor, but had a small little something that I thought could be improved. The tapas flowed very well into each other; and the paella was delightful at the end. I walked away very full."
,,,,,"Overall, a very good restaurant. Would definite come again in the near future."
,,,,,"One of my favorite places in Chicago! Delicious assortment of tapas for a really good price and amazing sangria! Some of my favorite dishes are the  cheese stuffed mushrooms, the paella, and the roasted goat cheese. The service has always been pretty good when I have been here and it is a really great place to take a large group because of the sharing style plates and variety on the menu. Make sure to call and reserve it is usually pretty busy."
,,,,,"Quick service, friendly staff, everything was delicious.. definitely come hungry. Food is heavy"
,,,,,"Cute spot for tapas, a chicago classic! Brought a friend here from out of town last week. The service was fantastic! We had patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, goat cheese, and vegetable paella. Not sure if I'm a big paella fan but everything else was pretty tasty! I don't drink but my friend had the mango sangria and said it was amazing!!! Would come again for an occasion or fun night out."

,,,,,"The atmosphere is fun, lively and loud. The place is huge! Much bigger than you expect from the outside. Nice modern Mediterranean feel."
,,,,,"The food was ok. We had more dishes than I can remember, but I wasn't wowed by any of it. I'd go again for the atmosphere."
,,,,,"This is one of my all time favorite Chicago restaurants because of the quality of food and the intimate setting. I usually make a reservation to secure a table. There is first come first serve for the front and back bar area. These usually fill up. Their happy hour specials are worth coming early for. We always enjoy a few staples like sangria, bacon wrapped dates, tomato bread and croquettes. Plates are shareable so I'd recommend getting tapas and a main to share."
,,,,,"I recently returned to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba after being away from Chicago for 6 years. I forgot how much I loved the tapas here (despite thinking tapas are a little silly...), and I can never say anything bad about the sangria. They offer a great happy hour, and sitting at the bar area was a nice change. I will definitely be back any time I'm in the area, and recommend it to anyone who needs dinner plans."

,,,,,We went to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba for happy hour and would for sure go back. The food is inexpensive and the sangria was $20 for a pitcher. It's a casual vibe and there was no wait for a Saturday. The sangria had a lot of fruit and didn't taste too alcoholic which we enjoyed. For food:
,,,,,"Bacon wrapped dates: not pictured, highly recommend "
,,,,,Tomato bread: good bread with high quality olive oil and tomatoes
,,,,,"Fried green pepper: shishito peppers with salt, simply but good"
,,,,,"Overall would come back for sure, great happy hour."
,,,,,"I haven't been in the mood for tapas in a long time. I have to say that the menus usually exhaust me. LOL. But our good friend suggested we meet here for brunch, so we happily gave it a try. My husband is always excited to see any kind of Benedict on the menu, so he went with that. One of my favorites is what I usually like to get anywhere, bacon wrapped dates! These are extra tiny and super satisfying! My other favorite of the morning was the ham croquettes! I loved how moist and flavorful they were!"
,,,,,"As things are continuing to re-open due to Covid, this place is still taking reservations. I would definitely recommend making them! Although I have to say that it was not overly crowded on a Saturday morning at all!"
,,,,,"Came for Happy Hour and it was exactly what we were looking for. Casual bar/dine-in spot with a good array of tapas for HH, but honestly their actual menu is very adorable. Was able to watch the college football game while enjoying bites that are several steps up from typical bar food."
,,,,,"Definitely make a reservation ahead of time, as this place is packed! It's a cute tapas place near Lincoln Park, so my friend and I visited the zoo then did a short walk here. The menu is large and very exciting, and with tapas you can try a bit of everything!"
,,,,,"We got the Patatas Bravas, Tomato bread, Garlic Shrimp, sangria flight, and Chicken/Veggie Paella and everything tasted great. Paella elsewhere is always like $40+ but here ours was $26 and could definitely feed 3-4 along with other tapas! However the server mixes it up for you and splits it up; I wish he just let us eat it from the pan!"
,,,,,The indoor decor is wonderful and theres a small patio; service was also great (he even helped us charge a dead iphone)! Would definitely come back to try more things!
,,,,,Came here on a Sunday evening and they are super packed! Definitely a very popular place with great service. 
,,,,,"We started with the classic red sangria. Honestly, not the best sangria I've had, but not bad either. Next time, I would get the sangria flight instead. Silly me never turned the menu over this time and didn't realize it was a thing. "
,,,,,"Grilled hanger steak - our favorite of the night. Beef was very tender, cooked medium rare, and the mushrooms side complimented the dish so well. "
,,,,,"Peri peri chicken thighs - our waiter said this is his favorite item on the menu. It was chicken thighs fried tenderly and covered in a sauce that reminded me of a milder & more tangy buffalo sauce. I'm not a fan of buffalo sauce in general so I was surprised that's what the dish tasted like. However, my partner really liked it as the chicken itself was very good. "
,,,,,"Spicy potatoes - we were told this is the most popular item on the menu. The potatoes were extremely crispy, had a spicy kick to it, and went really well with the tomato aioli. I would definitely get this again!"
,,,,,"Octopus - this dish was a bit of a miss for us. Some of the octopus were cooked very tenderly, while other pieces were extremely burnt and hard. We were also surprised that it came in a bed of oil, which didn't have much flavor but just made the dish very fatty. The potatoes were fine, but also caked in oil and nothing special."
,,,,,Deviled egg - this was so extremely salty. I've definitely had better deviled eggs elsewhere. Would not get this again.
,,,,,"Chorizo wrapped date - if you never had something like this before, it's an interesting snack to try! The saltiness of the chorizo really complemented the sweetness of the date well. "
,,,,,"Overall, not bad at all for a date night. I would come back again to try some of their other dishes!"
,,,,,"Cafe Babareeba is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I've been here many times and always have a great meal every time. Dinner is v good of course, but my fave is def brunch bc you can order off the brunch menu and the dinner menu. The staples I always get are the goat cheese with marinara, bacon wrapped dates (duh), potatas bravas, deviled eggs, avocado burrata toast, and stuffed shrooms. Off the brunch menu, I love the potato and onion omelette, the French toast, chicken skewers, and beef tenderloin Benedict. They also have fantastic sangria. Service is always excellent, major props for that! Highly recommend making a reservation and parking is sort of rough on Halsted. Pro tip: park on Armitage, east of halsted."

,,,,,"Some of our favorites include the bacon wrapped dates and the goat cheese baker in tomato sauce. We tried a few items for the first time. We really loved the beef tenderloin with blue cheese, which was perfectly cooked medium rare. The meatballs with tomato sherry sauce were good, just a little heavy due to all the cheese melted on top. The spinach and Manchego stuffed mushrooms were excellent and we loved the lemony sauce it came with! "
,,,,,"For drinks, you cannot go wrong with any of the sangrias. I highly recommend the red sangria, lots of fruit pieces and not overly sweet."
,,,,,"Wow, I'm completed taken aback by how good the Spanish-style tapas is here at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, nestled in Lincoln Park. It remotely reminds me of NYC where you can find great food almost anywhere aka residential or in a truck."
,,,,,"First off, management if you're reading this, please give Jose, our server, a generous raise. He has a very calming and cordial presence in the midst of lively vibrant ambiance. Loved his gentle sense of humor and non-judgmental attitude. He was knowledgeable and well cultured! "
,,,,,"Ok, on to the food and drinks. Everything was made to perfection! Every bite was  delicate, but packed with flavors! There wasn't a single item that was disappointing. We started off with sangrias... by the pitcher of course. Boy oh boy! Downed and it ordered some mint mojitos! "
,,,,,"The deviled eggs with the bacon was my favorite dish! It had this nice fluffy texture with a Smokey flavor (bacon bits). Also, loved the papas with the tomato aioli aka crack sauce. I dipped everything in that sauce! Beef skewer with horseradish and caramelized onions dish was like having a bite-sized steak dinner- totally fits as tapas style! You can never go wrong with seasoned garlic shrimp drenched in a buttery sauce. The seafood paella filled the space with aromatic flavors-- the feeling of warm home cooked meals when you return home. Finished off the night with a complimentary butterscotch pudding with whip. Then, we also ordered chocolate ganache and flan (which turned out to be a little too sweet), but still good nonetheless! "
,,,,,All in all. No complaints. Loved the vibrant ambiance. Loved the customer service. Loved the food. Loved the price. 6/5 stars please!
,,,,,"Ba-Ba-Reeba was the fan favorite of our Chicago trip! The interior has fun décor and many tables, but I would still recommend making reservations for busy dinner times. The star of the show was the Seafood Paella, and I think it's the best paella I've had outside of Spain! The crackling texture of the rice was absolutely phenomenal. If you do want a nice picture of the paella, make sure to quickly snap one before they scoop it out the pan to serve."

,,,,,Good but nothing mind blowing. Out of all the small plates the garlic potato salad was the order we went back to. Otherwise we just enjoyed their sangrias.
,,,,,"We went here as a group of 8. We had a nice table where we could talk! You need to wear your mask until you get to your table. This place is known for their tapas. They are the famous small dishes of Spain. We created  a meal with a variety of tapas, and  enjoyed one of their paellas as our main course. We had 1/2 pitcher of blood orange sangria (delicious) and ordered a bunch of items-one was  mac and cheese for our little guy with bacon on the side."
,,,,,"Also, warm potato and onion omelette, breakfast paella-bomba rice. spanish sausages and scrambled egg crust (supposedly feeds two but it was enough for the whole table - waiter suggested two but we really only needed one!), stuffed olives with white anchovy and pippara pepper (very good) , Burrata & Avocado Toast, Cilantro, Fresno Chilies & Gazpacho, House-Marinated Spanish Olives, click to toggle more inSpinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms, Avocado & Egg Toast*"

,,,,,"Oh, and you must get the paella. I repeat, you must get the paella. It was amazingly tasty and one of the best paella I've ever have had in my life. It compares to the paella from Spain! "
,,,,,"All in all, it was a fabulous meal and I can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,The food here is always delicious. Be prepared to share food and spend a lot. We enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates and paella the most! This place is always crowded but its also really big so you might be able to get a reservation day of. They're pretty good about spreading out the dishes you order at different times. Highly recommend for a larger group so you can try a lot.
,,,,,Great and quick service especially considering how busy it was but what we ended up with was mayonnaise and tapas and fried rice burned to a crisp(not socarrat). 
,,,,,"Probably wasn't a good idea to eat paella in a place people go to for tapas. Overall, food was more like Americanized Spanish."
,,,,,"We checked out Ba-Ba-Reeba for brunch over the weekend, and found it to be overall enjoyable! "
,,,,,"If you're planning to go for brunch, I'd definitely recommend making a reservation in advance. We popped in on a whim to discover that the only tables that they keep available for walk-ins are around the bar. We were lucky to snag a small table soon after we arrived, but it definitely fills up fast. "
,,,,,"We started with the Marcona Almond ""Nutella"" French toast. It was a tad dry for my liking and I actually wish it had been a bit sweeter, but as a whole it was pretty enjoyable. "
,,,,,"The Piri-piri chicken thighs had a good flavor, and were surprisingly moist/tender. The flavor profile wasn't mg personal favorite, but my friends enjoyed it a lot. "
,,,,,"The breakfast paella was much larger than I anticipated, and was more than enough for four of us in addition to the other few dishes we shared. The rice had a great texture, and the flavors were delicious and well balanced! It's definitely better to get the paella when going with a slightly bigger group, in order to try other things. "
,,,,,"The waffle battered chicken stick was my favorite, and I'd definitely get this again (in fact, I had to order a second while we were there)! The inside is actually a chicken sausage which I wasn't expecting, but it was tasty. The waffle batter was so delicious - nice and light, and balanced nicely with the light and sweet maple syrup! This is, in my opinion, a must try. "

,,,,,"Always a great time at Ba Ba Reeba! Second time here, this time with a larger group and it knocked it out of the park yet again. We all just threw in 2-3 tapas and had plenty of food to go around, and many new favorites!! We also went with a couple pitchers of sangria which hit the spot. "

,,,,,Burrata & avocado toast 
,,,,,Crispy Potatoes
,,,,,Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce 
,,,,,Skippable:
,,,,,Seared Txistorra Sausage
,,,,,Bacalao Cod croquettes
,,,,,"I need to give this place another try because it's a Chicago favorite to many and I didn't love my first experience. You see, the group you go with makes alll the difference in the world. It's served tapas style and if your table isn't hiving with your tastebuds you could end up with some mediocre combos. "
,,,,,"That being said, I remember loving the crispy potatoes and their steak. I'm not a huge fan of bacon, so the date bacon thing they're known for was not a vibe for me personally. "
,,,,,"But, the atmosphere is beautiful and it's a great option if you're looking for a lighter meal. I will have to give it another try for sure."
,,,,,"We really enjoyed our evening here!  We made a reservation for 5p as we knew this place was popular.  It was certainly hoppin' when we arrived.  Hubby and I spent a couple weeks in Spain on a food discovery trip, so we were excited to visit here for authentic Spanish tapas. "
,,,,,"Pro tip- order one thing at a time, else they bring it all out at once.   "
,,,,,The potatas bravas and tomato toasts were excellent (and generous portions) deviled eggs were yummy and the little filets were cooked perfectly.  Our 'dessert' was the goat cheese dip (we are not sweets people) and it was the highlight of the meal. 
,,,,,"Service was incredibly fast, the place was packed and they appear to be turning tables quickly.  I really, really wanted Paella, but it was just too much food for us.  This would be an excellent place to bring 8-10 friends so you could try everything. "

I dream about the potatoes with the red dipping sauce. This time we went for happy hour, so we started with the sangria flight--highly recommend! Loved sampling a few new things from the menu that I hadn't tried before. "
,,,,,Overall this is such a lovely and fun place. It's always at the top of my list for suggestions for dinner or brunch!

,,,,,"Been here twice - fantastic place with a reputation that precedes it. This place is great for any dining experience you need: dates, large parties, smaller friend gatherings etc. Cannot think of a single dish that was underwhelming or a service experience that wasn't smooth/great. The best dish (although not pictured) i've had there have been the croquettes."
,,,,,My work friends and I decided on this awesome spot for restaurant week and it was everything. Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba serves Spanish Cuisine in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. 
,,,,,"You will need a reservation (got ours on open table) during their hours of operation 4-9pm Monday through Sunday. The ambiance was chill and sexy like it'll make you want to get up, let your hair down and dance without a care in the world. Also, customer service was on point; loved how the servers engaged everyone with the food. That took the dinning experience to a whole different level"
,,,,,"The Restaurant Week Menu was a 3 course meal for $39 but because we were not sure we would like it, we decided to use the regular menu and split the bill. We ended up paying $40 each plus tax/tip. "
,,,,,We ordered and I recommend: 
,,,,,Tapas 
,,,,,Bacon Wrapped Dates
,,,,,Patatas Bravas 
,,,,,Shrimp with Garlic Olive Oil
,,,,,Beef/Chicken Empanadas (Beef)
,,,,,Fried Calamari 
,,,,,Absolutely cannot wait to go back to this spot.
,,,,,"One of the best meals I've had in a while! I love tapas but don't get them very often. My mom and sister had been talking this place up for me, and rightfully so. I got to try the brussel sprout salad, tempura squash, crystal bread, sweet potato coconut soup, and farmers market paella. It was all so amazing but I think my favorite thing overall was the squash, it was a special for the week, it had an amazing curry flavor and was the perfect combo of soft and crispy. The soup was delicious too, super creamy. The paella was amazing too, the 4 of us shared it and still had a ton left over. I would definitely love to come here again!"
,,,,,"This Tapas place was a fun experience while visiting Chi with some friends! We all picked our own appetizer and agreed on some additional ones to get a wide variety of things to try. It really was a gamble when ordering because we had never heard of most of the stuff on the menu, but we ended we up loving it all! They brought out appetizers 1-2 at a time so it was fun because the table could really enjoy each individual dish on its own! I think my personal favorites that we tried were the goat cheese in tomato sauce (mainly because I love goat cheese and it was cooked great). The Paella was also very tasty and flavorful. The sangria was great but almost $30 a pitcher is pricy when the pitcher is so small in my opinion. Also the bill can add up quickly so it was nice to split it between the table! The waiter we had was also very nice and helpful! Overall, it was a good experience."
,,,,,The food here is phenomenal! I love how you can get smaller portions and try a variety of different food I've never eaten before. I really enjoyed every dish we got!
,,,,,The drinks and service here were great as well!
,,,,,"I've heard a lot of good things about Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, so I was excited to see if it was worth the hype! We started out with a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria, which was really refreshing and yummy. We ordered 7 items to share between the 5 of us there, and everything is served tapas style. I would say we ordered the perfect amount of food for our group."
,,,,,"Out of the tapas we ordered, there were definitely some hits and some misses. The patatas bravas, brussels sprout salad and tomato baked goat cheese were all delicious, and the shrimp and croquetas were good, but I wouldn't get the piri-piri fried chicken thighs or crystal bread again. I definitely want to come back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to try the paella!"
,,,,,Always an amazing time coming here. My favorite place to go for tapas with friends. The sangria deals are absolutely amazing and I love that they offer kits as well as let you take pitchers to go (love no waste). Fun atmosphere every time!
,,,,,I was super excited to visit Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and it didn't disappoint. We enjoyed many of the tapas which you can view in my photos. My favorites were the beef empanadas and spicy potatoes. The chicken paella was also fantastic. It takes about 30-40 minutes to prepare and you only get an hour and a half reservation so be sure to order early during your meal. The sangria flights were also pretty tasty and a good portion for a flight.
,,,,,Cafe Baba Reeba is an all time favorite! The perfect place for a celebration or group dinner. My favorite dishes are the patatas bravas and brussel sprout salad!
,,,,,WOW! This restaurant was the foodie highlight of my Chicago trip. Loved the vibe of the restaurant.
,,,,,"Highly recommend the paella, peppers, gambas, dates, and red sangria. All excellent. "
,,,,,I spent a summer in Barcelona so I absolutely love tapas. I'm so glad I got to try this place out. 
,,,,,Service was top tier.

,,,,,"All the hype about this place is true. The best restaurant in Chicago hands down. It is more on the expensive side, but well worth it for celebrating special occasions. It is super difficult to make reservations so definitely make them months in advance for a decent time. You'll probably still get a late night reservation around 8PM even if you try to reserve in advance. "
,,,,,"I've had the spiced fried chicken, dry aged ribeye, lamb chops, garlic shrimp de jonghe, Brussels sprouts, truffle mac and cheese, and the wild mushrooms. All of them were delicious and I'd order them over and over again. You can't really go wrong with anything here but the best item on the menu is the dry aged ribeye cooked medium rare. "
,,,,,The service is the best. Servers come by often but not too often that it's annoying. I feel like I'm taken on a time machine to the 20s when I visit because of all the servers dressed in flapper attire and the dim lights.
,,,,,It was a great experience dining at this place. My best friend and I enjoyed the food and wine. The customer service was on point.  Great place for romantic date night.
,,,,,Very interesting interior design/style. It reminded me of retro prohibition. Be prepared once you walk in. The place is dark! It'll take your eyes a bit to adjust. 
,,,,,On this food journey...
,,,,,Seafood tower = amazing
,,,,,Bone marrow appetizer = amazing animal butter
,,,,,Bacon appetizer = a little amazing 
,,,,,Bone in ribeye = a little amazing. A bit under seasoned but well cooked. 
,,,,,Sides 
,,,,,Fries = meh
,,,,,Brussel sprouts = good
,,,,,Elote style corn = excellent
,,,,,Truffle Mac and cheese = slap ya momma good. Crazy good. 
,,,,,Desserts 
,,,,,Carrot cake = deelish
,,,,,Lemon meringue = deelish
,,,,,Chocolate mouse pie = slap momma again!
,,,,,"My go to for an amazing steak in Chicago, but don't expect to spend less than $100 here.  Sides are all amazing.  Some people don't know this but they are BYOB- as long as you share a glass of that vino with another table!  Love the dark ambiance and the service is always on point."
,,,,,Hands down my favorite steakhouse in Chicago. The feel inside takes you back to another time. Oh and the food well it's worth every penny. Went with the 42 day aged Ribeye amazing flavor and to be honest I would have just ate the mushrooms for a meal as they were so delicious. True Chicago classic!
,,,,,"We loved, loved this steak place.  "
,,,,,"Seating was upstairs and downstairs which where we wanted to sit.  Although we made reservations we still waited which was not a problem as we were told, it is not easy to get into this place.  And we saw why."
,,,,,The food and the service were just first class. You will enjoy this place.
,,,,,"Let's start with the beef,  we ordered the bone n ribeye, OMG it melts in your mouth.  Most delicious and tasty steaks in comparison to other spots we visited around the country."
,,,,,"For appetizers, we had the baked goat cheese, so so good."
,,,,,wine and cocktails were amazing.
,,,,,5 stars all the way!
,,,,,My favorite steak place in the city. I did takeout recently and am excited to dine inside again! The bread is the best sourdough I have ever had!
,,,,,"Steaks are good, but don't understand the hype."
,,,,,Went here for my birthday celebration.  It was a Tuesday night and we had a reservation at 7:30 pm.  We arrived at 7:30 pm on the dot and we were seated at 8:15 pm.   Had to ask the maitre'd what was going on; he sort of just waved us off.
,,,,,"I did like the atmosphere - it was homey, sort of like a warm tavern where you could escape the cold."
,,,,,"Steaks are all $55+ except for the petit filet.  I got the bone in New York strip, which was tender and at the level expected for a steakhouse.  I did think that the steak was a bit more chewy than I hoped it would be - but maybe I should have gotten it medium rare instead of medium.  My wife had a crabcake and a salad, which were also at the level expected for a steakhouse - kind of average because it was not a steak."
,,,,,We'll probably be looking for another steakhouse next year.
,,,,,Not your classic steakhouse but a really unique experience. Gets crowded but bar seating is first come. 
,,,,,In terms of the food the must try is the shrimp de jonge. Just get it and you won't be disappointed.
,,,,,"Was a little disappointed here I think it was rated number 1 we try a new steak place every year in Chicago it was ok. Just expected a little more I guess. Crab cakes ok , steak ok. They brought all the food out at once and you had an 1:45 min time limit because of the restrictions, and I didn't mind that. They did include a 4% Covid surcharge which you were not told either."
,,,,,218 W Kinzie St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,This place has excellent service and ambience. Unfortunately our bone in rib eye was pretty poor quality and it was 70$. For the price non of the food really wowed me or my partner. Maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. I'll try again once someone losses a bet and has to buy me dinner.
,,,,,"I've dined at Bavette's Vegas location first and when coming to Chi Town, realized they have the original here, I had to stop in!  Reservations were difficult as they are packed but I was able to secure a late night in the parlor downstairs.  While waiting on the beautiful dining room couches waiting for our table, we got some drinks and those were made well!  The food and service at Vegas was amazing and I was expecting this one to be the same.  I was told Parlor (only available seating, and was only available at 10:15pm vs dining room 10:45) was better, darker more romantic.  My wife and I loved the Chicago ambiance of the restaurant and classic speakeasy layout.  "
,,,,,"We then were taken downstairs and seated in a nice booth. It was much smaller, slightly darker and had some stuffed trophy animal heads on the wall. But instead of the nice Sinatra style music (upstairs) they were playing some nasty hip hop and it was significantly louder.  That single-handedly ruined the Bavette's experience.  The service was amazing and our food was delicious and cocktails were great but the music killed it.  I'd never sit down there again."
,,,,,"One of the most perfect dining experiences I've ever had. My husband and I had reservations, but we arrived early to have a drink at the bar. It took a hot minute for our eyes to adjust to the darkness of the restaurant. Once they did, I was taken aback by the absolute gorgeousness of the restaurant. I cannot even put it into words, I could have stayed there all night just taking everything in. We grabbed a spot at the bar, the bartenders were very nice and attentive. "
,,,,,"The hostess came and got us when it was time for our reservation, the restaurant was slowly starting to fill up. Our server came up right away to make sure we were good on drinks. She was FANTASTIC! Funny, professional, and attentive without hovering. We gave her our order for appetizers and our meals. Sourdough bread and butter arrived first to hold us over until our food started to arrive, the bread was soft, warm, incredible. We started our meal with east coast oysters (delicious,) then had the baked goat cheese appetizer (see photo). It was amazing! Then we got our entrees. The pacing between each course was perfect. Our steak (we both got dry aged ribeye,) was the definition of perfection. An awesome charred crust on the outside, cooked exactly to our liking on the inside. We shared a side of truffle macaroni and cheese. The portion was perfect for two people, but if there are more than two of you, I would get an additional side. I've been to many upscale steakhouses, and I've found the side dishes to often be more of an afterthought (good, but nothing to write home about). This was not the case with the macaroni and cheese here. It was absolutely the best I have ever had! The cheese sauce was rich, and creamy. When the pasta was gone, I found myself scooping up leftover cheese sauce and just eating it with my spoon."
,,,,,"Our dessert of chocolate cream pie was insanely good. The chocolate was rich and toned down by a cool light chocolate cream on top. From start to finish, this meal went above and beyond my (already high) expectations. I wouldn't think twice about making the 2 and a half hour trip to Chicago just to eat here again."
,,,,,"Restaurants like this should no longer exist. I was instantly put off by the humorless, overly accommodating, textbook trained staff lunging at us to fulfill the Hogsalt prophecy. ""Hello, sir."" ""Excellent choice, sir."" ""Well done, sir."" This self congratulatory, pube fluffing, Reagan era country club service style must die. The servers are posers, the clients play the part, and the bill is sky high at the end. My first real issue with Bavettes was them not brining out bread when we sat down at the table. It's standard practice there that only after you order is a basket of starch thrown down on the table. The onslaught of contrived, scripted, Remains of the Day pathetic servitude continued until our entrees were served in tandem with the appetizers. My steak frites (medium well) was lackluster - so much so that I only ate a few bites. Typically, I'm a member of the Clean Plate Club. For some reason, it came out pre sliced by the kitchen in overly thick cuts that allowed all the heat to escape. I don't know why they did this. In our party of six, I was able to sample a sizeable cross section of the menu - butter bombs all. Butter mushrooms, butter broccoli, butter brussel sprouts, butter steak. Also, I'm a fry boy. I consistently slam fries. Only made it through half of the Lowry seasoning salt and lard sodden potato slices before abandoning ship like the USS Indianapolis. The table to our left consisted of a group of pilled out 50 somethings - totally thwapped on anti depressants and overpriced seafood. To our right, a never ending cavalcade of waifish thots taking a break from serving their soulless corporate masters. The vibes were cold and off-putting. When the bill mercifully arrived (if it was more than $177 bucks - which it absolutely was - it would be highway robbery), I slugged the rest of my Coors Original and dismissed myself. Restaurants like these actually do serve a purpose- to highlight the gulf between food made with love, and those fleecing and suckering yuppies."
,,,,,Oh hello chocolate cream pie...where have you been my whole life?!?! And I don't even love chocolate! 
,,,,,This place is so great. No wonder reservations are so tough to get...
,,,,,The good: 
,,,,,-not too loud
,,,,,-THE BREAD AND BUTTER. Best sourdough bread I've ever had
,,,,,-shrimp dejongue (sp?) appetizer (tip: skip the texas toast and dip the sourdough bread in the sauce instead)
,,,,,-dry aged ribeye - so much flavor with every bite
,,,,,-truffle mac and cheese
,,,,,-brussel sprouts
,,,,,-mashed potatoes (the best I've ever had - and are even tastier as leftovers)
,,,,,-chocolate cream pie
,,,,,The not as good:
,,,,,"-i didn't like the fried chicken at all. Found it to be bland. And it wasn't chicken breast, which I particularly like. People on here have said they really liked it, but I don't get the appeal. Now the mashed potatoes that come with it are AMAZING. "
,,,,,-dark - what is it with all these Chicago places being so dark?!?
,,,,,-service wasn't very good towards the end of the meal
,,,,,This is the best steakhouse in town. Very nice setting and ambiance. Steaks are just amazing and don't even compare to other aged meats I've had in the past .
,,,,,We had a very nice birthday dinner here - seating in the lower level is more intimate and the plush booths are nice. BYOB and share a glass with another table was a cool touch as the table we shared with was celebrating a birthday as well. 
,,,,,"Dry aged ribeye was excellent as expected. Cooked perfect medium rare. Tenderloin steak tartare was great, but would have preferred pairing with chips than bread (our waitress told us that was an option after we finished the meal). Loved the Baked Crab Cake, crispy outside, juicy inside. Could have done without the short rib stroganoff (a little too salty and oily) and oysters. Peach sorbet was a refreshing finisher and a sparkler is always fun."
,,,,,"Would recommend for any special occasion! Check reservations well in advance to pick your time, but also check day of a couple times for any cancellations. I was able to snag a 5:30PM on day of!"
,,,,,"Probably the best steak I've ever had. It's worth visiting Bavette's just for the steak alone, but that said, the ambiance, service, music, decor, and other menu items make it an incredible restaurant for a date night, an evening out with friends, and it's casual enough to do what I did and had an early dinner with my family. "
,,,,,My youngest son just ate oysters - 2 types from the west coast and 2 types from the east coast. Fresh and perfectly shucked (although a bit on the steep side at $3.50 a pop). My oldest son had the burger - which had two patties and an absurdly large portion of fries - both delicious. 
,,,,,"My wife ordered the mixed green and apple salad which was fine, and the 6oz filet which had a nice crusty sear on it and was cooked to perfection. "
,,,,,"I ordered the classic ribeye Chicago cut. I can't speak highly enough of the quality of the meat, how perfectly it was cooked (proper medium rare seems to be harder to achieve than one would think in many fine establishments), how expertly it was seasoned... it was the best steak I can remember ever having. "
,,,,,For dessert they threw in a chocolate cream pie on the house which was a rich and creamy with a crust that tasted like Oreos and a generous topping of whipped cream. 
,,,,,"The wine list wasn't anything to write home about, but that can be overlooked. The price tag is hefty, but that's to be expected at a swanky prime steakhouse. "
,,,,,All in all I'm sad that it took me this long to discover Bavette's and I can't wait to visit again next time I'm in Chicago!
,,,,,"Make reservations in advance....like at least a few weeks, okay? If you're having a celebration, let them know so your table can receive a pretty sparkler dessert; very photo worthy!"
,,,,,"I came here with my family and boyfriend while my parents were in town. It's great for that since it's an iconic steakhouse. If you don't already know where it is, you might pass it! It's between Kinzie Chophouse and Gilt Bar."
,,,,,"Service is fantastic. Menu is pretty diverse, even if you don't like steak. Hot chicken, anyone? Each couple split their popular 42 day aged ribeye which was delicious. I say that it's flaky, but I mean that in the very best way. It was so tender and tasty. Appetizer: goat cheese with marinara and some Parmesan maybe? Served with Texas toast. Really enjoyed that. Sides: creamed spinach (not my pick but it was good), candied sweet potatoes (yum), and TRUFFLE MAC AND CHEESE. I'd go back and just eat a bowl of this. Holy cannoli, so so good. Sides are easily shared between 2 people. The sourdough bread is something like mom would make in a bread maker at home. It came out so warm and fluffy. Salted butter melted right over it. "
,,,,,Don't be like me and say you're too full for chocolate cream pie. Be like my dad that ordered it and shared. It was incredible. Such a great dinner experience! 
,,,,,"Notes: they allow you to BYOB as long as you share a glass with another table! No corking fee past that. Also, boyfriend ordered the bone marrow and loved it!"
,,,,,"Mac and cheese is amazing. The chocolate mousse dessert is very heavy, not the best. Carrot cake is a better choice!"

,,,,,Easy.  
,,,,,"Parlor!! (Do not forget.  You will be guaranteed another date, 35 years of marriage, or at least a very memorable evening by sitting here)"
,,,,,You definitely need a reservation. Book through Resy and you're set.
,,,,,"While I have dined in the main dining room, the parlor oozes sexiness. The booths are huge and perfect for a group or cozying up with a special someone.  "
,,,,,"It doesn't matter what you order because it will be fabulous.  I'm boring and just get the steak and frites.  It's a flavorful cut, has a killer crust, and is served to your temp preference. Definitely try a couple sides.  That mac and cheese is sensational.  As is the charred broccoli."
,,,,,I definitely save room for dessert--a few bites of chocolate cream pie and as much salted caramel ice cream as possible.
,,,,,Noteworty: their bread service is incredible.
,,,,,"Thanks to my lovely Yelp friends and their crazy good reviews, I chose to dine here.  And loooooooved it."
,,,,,"After making a reservation via Opentable, I needed to call them and add another guest onto the reservation.  The person who answered made me feel dumb bc I didn't know the difference between the parlor and the upstairs dining area.  That aside, I am glad we were seated downstairs in the parlor because it oozed sexiness."
,,,,,"My girlfriends and I tried several cocktails, but I particularly loved their sparkling rose.  We started with the baked goat cheese, which came with slices of toasty, crusty bread.  Followed up with some oysters.  I went with the braised veal cheeks....sooo rich and delicious.  My friends both selected the beef stroganoff, which was an elegant version of what mom used to make.   Sorry mom, but Bavette's stroganoff is way better! "
,,,,,"The chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.  It's truly a chocolate lovers dessert.  Very rich, and well executed.  We loved the huge quenelle of lightly sweetened whipped cream.    It added a fun whimsy element.  "
,,,,,Service was excellent.  bartenders were beardy.  Decor is killer.  
,,,,,Love. this. place.
,,,,,This comes with an asterisk because we ate outside during Covid.
,,,,,"The service was ok, kind of slow, but really the issue was the food was just ok. For the prices, I would have expected a more flavorful steak and more interesting/intense flavors on the apps."
,,,,,Wonderful steakhouse in Chicago! Great ambiance and friendly staff. It says that it's very fancy so I went in a nice dress and my boyfriend went in jeans with a suit jacket. But there were guys in shorts and a polo. So it's really whatever you feel comfortable in! Very dark and not too big of a space. We were worried it was going to get too loud but it really didn't! Highly recommend making a reservation as this place seems to always be packed!
,,,,,The sides were my favorite part of the meal. We ordered the truffle Mac & cheese and the Brussels sprouts. Both were outstanding. The Mac had a really rich cheese sauce. The Brussels sprouts had a great vinegarette and they were cooked so well that they just melted in my mouth. 
,,,,,For the entrees we ordered the short rib stroganoff and the petite filet. The petite filet was great - not too much seasoning and cooked to my standard. We didn't really like the short rib - had a bit of an odd taste to it so I wouldn't recommend that dish. 
,,,,,"Overall, we left with full bellies that were very satisfied!"
,,,,,"Reservations are hard to come by! Make sure you reserve way in advance, especially if you're trying to get a coveted weekend dinner spot. I went with two friends. We booked about 3 weeks in advance for a Wednesday evening at 8pm in the dining room (sophisticated vibes). I hear the vibe downstairs in the parlor is different and more laidback with different music. Despite having a reservation, we still waited about 15min to be seated. "
,,,,,"Bavette's is on many lists of chicago's most romantic restaurants, and I could certainly see why after entering. It's dimly-lit and sultry. "
,,,,,I love their byow policy. There's no corkage fee if you share half a glass with another table. 
,,,,,I ordered the traditional 10 oz filet mignon ($59.95) and had a bit of leftovers the next day. We split two sides for the table ($15 each): the truffle Mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. Both were really good. 
,,,,,"Had the chocolate cream pie ($12) for dessert, which was highly raved about in yelp. It didn't disappoint. Rich, decadent, chocolatey. Sort of melts in your mouth. Shareable between 3 people. Would definitely be pretty dense for just one person lol. "
,,,,,"Service is on point, as would be expected in a restaurant of this caliber. Hoping to come back one day!"
,,,,,"This is definitely one of our favorites in Chicago. From the atmosphere to the traditional drink menu, Bavette's is a classic ""must-try."""
,,,,,"There are so many menu offerings that appeal to us so we tend to order plates to share. Our favorite sides to share include the elote style corn (do yourself a favor and order two if you're sharing!), truffle mac and cheese, thick-cut bacon, and the pommes frites with garlic aioli. To be fair, we don't feel you can go wrong with any of the side offerings!"
,,,,,"For entrees, we love the beef stroganoff and Bavette's spice fried chicken. The cheeseburgers are also incredibly perfect. "
,,,,,"For dessert, we absolutely cannot skip the carrot cake! It's big enough to share and is absolutely amazing!"
,,,,,"If you haven't been here, make your reservation now. They fill up quickly so a reservation is a must."
,,,,,Wow what a place! 
,,,,,We came here for dinner after hearing rave reviews from our friends and this place definitely exceeded our expectations. 
,,,,,"Our server was great, super nice and attentive. The food was delicious as well, I got the rib eye steak which was a solid 8.5/10, the crab cake was just WOW WOW WOW. Best crab cake I've ever had in my life solid 12/10. The sorbet ice cream at the end was very good as well, nothing mind blowing but then again it's ice cream so it's pretty standard"
,,,,,"I have to add the bread is AMAZING, soft with a hard crunch and the butter is PERFECT. "
,,,,,The place is also very nicely decorated with a speakeasy feel and great drinks as well.
,,,,,Highly recommended!
,,,,,"The best steakhouse I've been to. The Mac and cheese, fries, brussel sprouts, filet mignon and the complimentary bread were all delicious. The server was really nice and attentive too. I would come back but getting a reservation here is so difficult"
,,,,,"So amazing....I am beyond thrilled my great friend recommended this fantastic place! Superb service, amazing food, alluring ambiance....this is an instant favorite spot!"
,,,,,Favorite place. The ambiance is super cool and the food is amazing. Make a reservation because it's difficult to just walk in.
,,,,,"Went here for an anniversary celebration. We had made a reservation a week in advanced, but when we arrived we were told that it was full inside and the only available spots were outdoor seating. Luckily there were heating lamps which made it bearable, but it did make the food cold which dampened the experience a bit. Other than that, the food was top notch. We started off with warm sourdough bread served with butter. The slices were huge! I also tried the fresh oysters (never tried oysters in my life) and it was quite interesting. Very flavorful but definitley and acquired taste. The baked goat cheese... SO good and filling. It came with garlic bread and the cheese mixed with the tomato sauce was delightful. For the main courses: bone in dry aged rib eye with bone marrow, and truffle mac n cheese. I didn't care much for bone marrow (my bf wanted it) but it definitley was melt in your mouth good. We got medium rare for our ribeye. I think I was pretty full tbh by the time we got to the steak. But it had copious amount of flavor and was super tender. The mac n cheese and chocolate pie was probably my biggest takeaway from this place, and will probably be the main reason I come back. Definitely recommend trying these items."

,,,,,"This place can be overbooked (for good reason), and be posh - but there is first come first served seating areas that are worth a shot if you can't get a reservation."
,,,,,"This might be my new favorite restaurant. My husband and I sat downstairs in the parlor. We shared the crab legs, porterhouse special, and mashed potatoes. Hands down the best meal I've had in such a long time. The service was also amazing!! We didn't have to wait for anything. They were so quick and on top of it. I loved the vibe, food, and service!! Do yourself a favor and splurge on the porterhouse!"
,,,,,"Omg!!! Now the best restaurant I've ever been to. I usually compare my steak restaurants by their filet. This was hands-down one of the best but what would put it over the edge was the butter and béarnaise sauce. Sides are awesome, had the corn and baked potato. Anything with bacon is worth getting. We had the wedge salad and the bacon was literally the best I've ever had. Wife loved the chocolate Creme pie dessert. Romantic ambience and exceptional service. This is a great place to celebrate special occasions."
,,,,,"Came back finally, not as impressed. The bacon was glorified ham. The steaks were all charred, had to be trimmed. The service was a bit slow."

,,,,,"Bavette's has been on my bucket list for quite some time as it's been rated as one of the best steaks in Chicago. The last steakhouse I went to was Eddie Merlot's in Louisville and it was God awful. It was the worst steakhouse I have ever been to and I was craving a steak. So I came here right before a Bourbonfest at Untitled as I needed some food in my stomach. I arrived right at opening around 5:05pm on a Tuesday and noticed there were people already seated. I sat at the bar and saved a seat for my buddy. Lo and behold around 5:15pm all of the seats were taken and the bar was crowded from the work rush hour. The place was very dimly lit, fancy, and looked like a bigger Maude's Liquor Bar. Ironic since the restaurant group owns both places (along with Au Cheval) and they are all French. They also have a basement/speakeasy downstairs, which I did not explore. "
,,,,,"I sat down and ordered an Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was very good. It was sweet, decently strong, and had a few big rocks so it wouldn't water down super fast. It is what to expect when it comes to a $14 cocktail and a high quality steakhouse. We both ended up getting our own 10oz Filet Mignons and ended up splitting a Mac n Cheese with bacon knowing that steakhouse sides are always massive. I ended up passing on the sourdough bread as I didn't want to be overly stuffed for the Bourbonfest. "
,,,,,"I've had many steaks in my lifetime including Chicago Cut, Gibson's, Morton's, Smith & Wollensky's, etc. and Bavette's was the best I have ever had besides my own grilling of course. The steak was cooked to perfection as it was juicy, tender, and well seasoned with a little bark/crust on top. You know a steak is good when it doesn't need any additional toppings, sauce, or seasoning and this was the case at Bavette's. I did try the bearnaise sauce and salt seasoning and both were amazing too. The Mac n Cheese with bacon is one of the best Mac n Cheese's I've had in the city. It was hot, creamy, not overly rich, cheesy, and sweet due to the bacon. It was heavenly! I didn't realize that Bavette's was owned by Hogsalt, which is the same owners as Au Cheval until now and they use the same bacon that they put on their burgers. If you don't know, Au Cheval was rated as the best burger in the nation a few years ago. "
,,,,,"Service was outstanding! Even though they were very adamant about ordering an appetizer, recommending the $5 upcharge for bacon for the Mac n Cheese (worth it), having another drink, and ordering dessert. But hey that's good business. I felt welcomed, the bartenders were very attentive, water was never empty, and the food came out in a reasonable time. Price was not absurdly expensive either. Steaks ranged from about $60 - $80, sides were $15, and cocktails were $14. The environment was more intimate and date night rather than business and loud. I didn't think it was overly loud like Gibson's. Overall, if you are looking for an amazing steak at a reasonable price, then go to Bavette's. I will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"I was on the hunt for the best steakhouse in Chicago for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. This place is definitely it!! Myself being a vegan, it is very difficult to find a steakhouse that has any options (I just ask for one salad!!). I was very happy to see they offer a vegetarian menu that includes items that can be veganized. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was AMAZING and so accommodating. On top of that, my boyfriend said it was the best steak he's ever had (he got the dry aged rib eye). Atmosphere and drinks were *chef's kiss*. I would definitely come back here again, it's worth the price."
,,,,,"The most comfy, romantic, sophisticated place ever. Food is absolutely amazing and an even better atmosphere. Check this place out if you haven't!"
,,,,,Not enough words to fill the page. The Parlor Room is the best atmosphere with the best music in Chicago. Best Espresso Martini concocted.
,,,,,Back to my favorite restaurant trying something different. The burgers were amazing. 
,,,,,It made it to the list of my top burgers in Chicago. If you like the primal taste of juicy beef and cheese. Bavette is the place for you - what an American classic should taste like
,,,,,Try the burgers and stay for the dessert!
,,,,,"P.S the steaks are amazing, but we all know that. The burger is under the radar:)"
,,,,,"There's not much more I can say about this place other than WOW...and oh. my. God. Everything was incredible, including entrees, sides and cocktails. Also the waiter (Joe) was lovely. He gave us complimentary pickle back shots because a patron accidentally whipped me in the face with his backpack, lol. I wasn't even that upset about it, but our server saw it and decided to surprise us with something nice. Very much appreciated. This is a can't miss spot in Chicago."
,,,,,"My tastebuds are overwhelmed with joy. There are not enough stars to insert on this review. Food was off the chart, and service was superb! My family and I shared a 16 ounce ribeye, a bone in New York, truffle Mac and cheese, button mushrooms, and silky potatoes. Drinkwise, littlel rosé martini, the French 75 were both incredible drinks that I HIGHLY recommend. We did not order any dessert because we were stuffed with all of the delicious food we eat, but I am sure that it would be as amazing as the rest of the food. I cannot wait to visit Bavette's restaurant again."

,,,,,"It's been almost a year since we visited but can't wait to be able to do so again. The atmosphere, service, and food were all fantastic. When we showed up with our 2 year old we weren't sure if we would get pushed to the side or not but were pleasantly surprised. We dined down stairs and had a wonderful steak, lamb chops, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes. For dessert we got some lemon meringue pie and it came out with a sparkler on it, my wife and I were confused how they knew we were celebrating our anniversary and the waitress said ""I thought it would be fun for her"" (our daughter). It is the little things that make a good place a great place. We have told many people they should check this place out and will continue to do so."
,,,,,"Such a classy joint! I imagine this is how it felt to go out in the 20s. It's such an event, just walking in!"
,,,,,"I'm not a huge steak person so I had a crab stuffed avocado, which was delicious. I'm not even a huge before-dinner-bread person, but omg their bread. It may be the best dinner bread I've ever had."
,,,,,"Also, I'm very particular about oysters, and whaddya know, their oysters were perfection."
,,,,,"Nothing wrong with this experience. Perfect restaurant, ambiance and service!"
,,,,,"Glad we were able to come here for my hubs birthday. Although no one asked us if we were celebrating anything and other tables seemed like they were getting special treatment, we had a good time. We really appreciated how safe and clean all the servers were throughout our time there. Menu and check were paperless which was convenient and also appreciated. The filet was so juicy and perfectly cooked. The chicken was deliciously crusted on the outside and also filled with juicy flavor. Salad was refreshing and the mac was creamy and also very delicious. The ice cream was mediocre, nothing super special. Would we go there again? Perhaps."
,,,,,"Hands down, my most favorite Chicago restaurant of all!!!! I've been here too many times. Never ever disappoints!"
,,,,,Excellent bone marrow app prepared under broiler. Their wedge salad with uber thick piece of bacon is like nowhere else I know. Their burgers are to die for and they serve the best icy martinis in town.
,,,,,Try the seafood tower (if your wallet can hold you) its amazing and quite impressive. The best music of any other restaurant in Chicago as well...and the BEST thing of all? THE BREAD!!! Forget about it! 
,,,,,Hard to get in but there's always someone relocating from the bar where you can sit and dine just as well as at any table there.
,,,,,GO!!!!
,,,,,**This review is for in-person seating**
,,,,,"Bavette's brings all the right vibes, tastes, and aromas. We were seated in the basement - which is a much more intimate, sexy, dim-light setting than the upstairs area. Definitely has an exclusive feel to it."
,,,,,"Food - Oysters are great, come in a beautiful presentation. You can choose between east coast and west coast sourced - we ordered both. I had a preference toward the East Coast - a bit more robust flavor."
,,,,,Steak - must order. Arguably one of the best in Chicago.
,,,,,Drinks - We ordered the champagne smash and ended up ordering a couple of rounds - classy and delicious.
,,,,,"The higher price range pays off with the ambiance, music, and quality food."
,,,,,Food + Ambiance + music = 5 stars. Perfect for a date night.
,,,,,"Although several friends have told me they love Bavette's, I have not been in person.  The restaurant is in my neighborhood though, and when walking by we saw they were offering takeout during COVID-19.   Somehow, I ended up getting their emails and during this time they have done some AWESOME specials.  We've now ordered twice!  Here are the deets:"
,,,,,RANDOM TUESDAY NIGHT
,,,,,"I got an email about their Burger & a Beer special.  Neither of us felt like cooking, so we ordered two specials and picked them up about 6pm on a random Tuesday night.  We took our feast to Montgomery Park, spread out a socially-distanced picnic blanket and had at it!  The burgers were delicious - a perfect medium rare .... everything you want in a big, succulent, indulgent steakhouse burger.  The fries were perfectly crisp and salty.  A fantastic way to experience Bavettes for the first time."
,,,,,FATHER'S DAY FEAST
,,,,,"A few days before Father's Day, I got another email with an inspired offering.  A few clicks and we had preordered .... could not wait for the day to arrive!  What we got:"
,,,,,- a delicious & incredibly tender whole roasted chicken with jus & roasted garlic sauce (yum!)
,,,,,"- super-yummy, silky, creamy mashed potatoes"
,,,,,"- crispy/crunchy, deliciously charred broccoli"
,,,,,"- two servings of a delicious, rich, creamy chocolate silk pie"
,,,,,- lovely bottle of wine
,,,,,All for just $99!  Are you kidding me?
,,,,,"We feasted as we extolled the virtues of the dad (my BF) we were celebrating.  SO GOOD!  Check out Bavette's and get signed up for their emails so you, too, can enjoy fantastic social distanced meals and support one of our local gems."
,,,,,"After seeing the reviews and hearing so many good things about Bavette's, I was very excited to finally come here and check it out! My boyfriend and I went for the first time Sunday at 6:30PM for our anniversary."
,,,,,"The atmosphere is very cute, cozy, and intimate; there's low lighting and music, but the music is quiet enough that you can still converse easily. What a great date spot! "
,,,,,"The staff wished us a happy anniversary and showed us to our table. They offered to take our coats, but I have a tendency to get cold so I kept mine. "
,,,,,"I believe our server's name was Ben? He was great! He gave us a rundown of the menu and we ended up getting the crab cake, the fillet mignon, and the dry aged bone in ribeye. He would float behind us and ask if we needed anything without being overbearing. Loved the service!"
,,,,,"Let me start by saying this is the best crab cake and fillet mignon I've ever had. The crab cake was seared on the outside, and creamy inside. The flavors were rich and just a little tartar sauce topped the whole thing off. A must order! I loved the bread and butter served with the meal as well; the bread had a hard crust and was warm and soft in the middle. "
,,,,,My fillet also had great flavor and I got it with the roasted garlic - AMAZING! The knife cut it like butter and having it cooked medium rare was perfect for me. The dry age steak had a great flavor as well and was fatty and delicious. Bavette's has pretty generous portions in general so we had a hard time finishing our food. 
,,,,,Another thing I appreciate is they brought us new plates between dishes and wiped the table of crumbs. I love when restaurants really care about the dining experience of the customer!
,,,,,Overall I was very impressed with my experience here. I will definitely be back! :)
,,,,,"By far the absolute best restaurant I've been to hands down! The service was superb, the food was delectable and the ambiance was so nice. A friend and I had the roasted chicken, ( I don't eat steak ) the lamb chops, the truffle Mac, creamed spinach and the baked goat cheese. All of which were delicious. I've been to quite a few restaurants and this one has earned ever star given . I can't wait to go back !"
,,,,,Absolutely stunning dining floor with that 1920s French parlor vibe. Our server Emily was so friendly and a great sport. We really enjoyed the dry aged bone in and crab cakes. Can't wait to come back for more!
,,,,,"World class Steakhouse in Chicago. Absolutely top shelf quality, in terms of: ambience, service, food, drinks, and overall experience. There is a reason why it takes months to get a reservation. "
,,,,,"I just had my after engagement dinner here, and after all of the things that went wrong leading up to the proposal, this dinner  went right. I  can also trust in Bavettes delivering on all fronts to make a great experience for me and my fiancé. "
,,,,,I am a customer for life and enjoy spending special occasions here. Our server John was fantastic and helped enhance our experience. 
,,,,,"On a side notee, I i tried the truffle Mac and cheese for the first time and the only way I could describe it is like heaven in my mouth. I've had some unbelievable Mac and Cheese in my day and this is light years better than any Mac I have ever had."

,,,,,"I made a reservation here for mine and my wife's 20th anniversary based upon a recommendation from a Chicago raised work mate in Los Angeles. The best I could do was a 4:15pm because apparently, everyone else wants to eat here as well. At it's heart, it's an old world steakhouse, but the thing that you'll figure out pretty quickly is that old world doesn't mean typical. We were instantly greeted by our server Barbara who set a tone of ""no rush"" by inviting us to settle in before we made any decisions on drinks or food. Our experience from then on was one ""best ever"" after another. The steak tartare is simply to die for. My wife was worried when it was served that she would fill up on the incredible bread it's served with. Barbara picked up on this and had one of her assistants bring out some of their insanely good chips to have as an alternative. This is the level of detail we experienced in service and quality of food throughout the meal. This restaurant does not leave any detail to chance and it shows in every single course. I cannot possibly recommend this restaurant highly enough if you're looking for a classic, detail oriented steakhouse in Chicago. I cannot wait for our next trip."
,,,,,"We had a great dinner and our server Eric was professional and made the night.  The food was great,  and service was perfect!! We will be back."
,,,,,"We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past. Of course, due to covid, things have changed. They require a $200 deposit prior to coming in. They charge a 4% ""covid fee"" which in our case was $22. $22 for what? For our waiter to wear a cloth mask and disposable gloves? "
,,,,,"In addition, they have drastically increased their prices. They charged $26 for a glass of turnbull Cabernet when the retail price on the bottle is $46. "
,,,,,Our waiter expressed to us several times how he was worried about his job. I do understand that but bringing it up over and over wasn't really the vibe we wanted. I won't be surprised if this place doesn't make it.
,,,,,"Here's what you need to know: this is my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Incredible steaks and service, along with the beat BYOB policy ever - share a glass of your wine with a stranger in the restaurant and you don't pay corkage. Order the mixed green and apple salad along with the crab cake and burger with bacon for apps (yes especially the burger since it's the Au cheval burger with pork belly). Order the bone in filet (they have limited quantities and they can run out at the end of a busy night) with a side of mushrooms for dinner and the chocolate cream pie for dessert. Note: Very hard to get reservations on weekends or even regular dinner hours on weekdays. Pro tip, if you're really looking for amazing service, ask to be seated in John's section. He makes your experience better :)"
,,,,,"Every menu item is some of the best I've ever tasted in that category, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and ambiance. The bone if filet is an absolute triumph. They even have a great bar with remarkable wine and whiskey selections. Although it claims to be French in its style, it's really an unpretentious American steakhouse :)"
,,,,,"I've tried every single item on their menu, and with the exception of the bone marrow (overhyped) and the baked potato (good, not great) absolutely nothing has disappointed me. Even their crab cake (at a non seafood focused steakhouse) is extraordinary. The aged ribeye is their second best steak offering (behind the bone in filet), and either of those could go up against any steak out there (including A5 Wagyu) and give it a run for its money. They offer the authentic Au Cheval burger (rated #1 in the US by critics and diners alike) on their menu with their famous bacon (really, pork belly). The mushrooms are the best side I've ever eaten. The truffle Mac n cheese is super rich but outstanding on its own since the truffle is not overbearing."
,,,,,"My standard order is the crab cake and apple salad, followed by the bone in filet (even though I'm an aged ribeye guy typically), a side of mushrooms, and end with the chocolate pie. And of course, MOST IMPORTANTLY, bring indulgently extravagant great wine - we always do :)"
,,,,,Average ticket is just shy of $100/person with liberal ordering and can be a lot less if you share entrees.
,,,,,"I don't know what I love more about Bavette's.  The ultra sexy, sultry, swanky space.. or the ultra sexy, sultry, dreamy Chocolate cream pie.  This pie is unforgettable. I would drive here JUST for this."
,,,,,"Bavette's is like a big turn on. The mood is flirty & seductive - dark unobtrusive lighting adorned by flickering candlelight throughout.. Masculine feel, speakeasy vibe. Deep red leather booths..exposed brick walls...soft, jazzy tunes. Intimate yet comfortable. Posh without being pretentious.  I love everything about the ambiance. But I will say the acoustics leave more to be desired...We found ourselves struggling to hear one another."
,,,,,"It's not easy to get reservations here.  If you're thinking ""Let's swing by Bavette's this weekend""...think again.  I knew this spot was popular but didn't realize they get booked for up to a month or two in advance.  After searching OpenTable I learned just how popular this place is.  Our reservation was made a month in advance for 5pm on Sunday. Timing was perfect as it followed an early opera.  Doors open at 4:30 which is good to note because it was empty when we happened to arrive early and luckily, seated immediately.   "
,,,,,"""To order the 45 day dry aged bone in ribeye, or to not order the 45 day bone in ribeye.""  This question was begging for answers.  No, we didn't ask our attentive but somewhat robotic waiter, Joel? Service was solid, but felt ingenuine.  Bus boys provided stellar service.  Never a water glass unfilled. They constantly checked on our table.  Want more of the complimentary, delicious, super crusty & airy sourdough bread?  It's excellent, but don't fill up on this, cause the really good stuff is about to come.  We took advantage of the BYOB.  Avoid paying a corkage fee ($15) by sharing one glass of your bottle with a neighbor.  The table next to us kindly thanked us. I happen to like their take on this."
,,,,,"Our night started off with the expertly made Lions Tail; one of their bourbon signature cocktails. Lime and bourbon makes for a great pairing. It went down easy..so easy I had three.  Appetizers: Half order Lyonnaise, half dozen East coast oysters.  Lyonnaise was fabulous, probably the best I've ever had.  Lightly dressed with perfectly cooked poached eggs and two thick slices of pork belly. The half order is sizeable for sharing and won't leave you full like a Wedge would.  And, the best part is - you get to sample the pork belly without having to order a full appetizer portion.  For two people this kills 2 birds with one stone when you want to taste more of the menu. Oysters were excellent, but $21 for 6?  Save it for two slices of Chocolate cream pie instead. "
,,,,,"Substantial sides:  Buttery garlic mashed & Truffle mac & cheese. For entrees: Chicago 16 oz ribeye med rare; added bone marrow. He had the 22 oz 45 day dry aged bone-in ribeye med rare.  Garlic mashed potatoes had roasted garlic throughout.  We both loved it.  A little decadent even. Garlic did not overpower this buttery, fattening delight.  Truffle mac & cheese was average, nothing mind blowing.  Nice balance of truffle."
,,,,,"Our steaks were cooked perfectly and beautifully charred.  Flavor wise, it wasn't missing a thing, BUT the dry aged ribeye didn't have the juiciness  and tenderness he was expecting. He even noticed an off putting smell and couldn't finish it.  In hindsight, we should have inquired on the dry aged.  Ultimately, dry or wet aged is really a matter of preference.  We were far to full to order dessert, but I made sure the Chocolate cream pie slice went home with me.  My only regret?  That I didn't order two.  This dark, almost black slice was pure decadence. The dark chocolate flavor was incredibly intense. The texture; velvety & sublime. All sitting on a oreo crust.  If there's one thing I'll remember about our dinner, it's the pie.  Pie and ambiance.  And then food. But first pie."
,,,,,"While I can't say Bavette's was the best steak I've ever had, the quality and preparation was exceptional. What I can say without a doubt - their chocolate cream pie IS phenomenal!"
,,,,,Such incredible service! Our server Erik was amazing - he was so attentive and gave great recommendations! Raul was so great too! Amazing food for every course - would highly recommend for everyone no matter what the occasion!
,,,,,"What the flux!!! Why have I not come here sooner in my pathetic life! All these years wasted at mediocre bars serving up lame ass steaks, while all along this sexy hole was serving up bitch'n good cow meat that makes my mouth orgasm! Atmosphere is super chill, dark and casually classy. "
,,,,,"By the time we arrived all the dining areas were taken, but we were able to order from the bar. In fact, I prefer to eat at the bar! Bartender provided awesome service and knew the menu and specials very well. "
,,,,,"I highly recommend eating your next steak here, and the bone marrow was so smooth, like warm tasty sexy butter. If you're in Chicago, be sure to make a reservation or get there early."
,,,,,"Service and food was amazing! Would definitely recommend. Celebrated my boyfriends birthday and he definitely enjoyed the environment. We ordered the seafood tower, the ribeye steak and side order of truffle Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. All of it was done well and no complaints."
,,,,,It's hard to get a reservation but try anyways because you may luck out like we did and get a table later at night! There was a wait but there is a comfortable waiting area in the front where you can enjoy a drink as you wait. 
,,,,,"We had a salad and shared the 16oz ribeye. As expected from such a great institution, the service was impeccable and the food was amazing. They figured out we were celebrating our anniversary so they even gave us a lovely goblet of icecream for dessert!!! "
,,,,,Worth a visit!!
,,,,,Flipping AMAZING....  I highly recommend Bavette's as it's truly a unique establishment with an even more unique menu. There's literally nothing on their menu that's not amazing.

,,,,,"I've been here a lot and I love it. We ordered take out last weekend and got the amazing sourdough, salmon Caesar salad which is fantastic, charred broccoli and the bone in filet. I always get nervous ordering takeout when it's so expensive but this was fabulous. I miss going there and look forward"
,,,,,To returning when restaurants reopen.
,,,,,"This is nothing but a false reality, enter and you are an alien. You are clearly on another dimension - obvIously on another planet. I can say with the utmost confidence you are not on this planet. You enter a world of unconsciousness. You are not within your own body. You are renting an alien body. Because if you are as well traveled - both foreign and domestic - you would understand that you just had the blessing to enter a world you have never traveled - restaurant perfection."
,,,,,"I've been to about 30 countries by the ripe age of 24. I've waited outside of restaurants in the cold for 2.5 hours, ate at House of Prime Rib...Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse, L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, and many more."
,,,,,"This restaurant is without a doubt the most spectacular, outrageously, delicious, mind boggling restaurant I've ever been to."
,,,,,Let's start with the ambience...there are 3 doors before you can be greeted by a kind lady. Then another door before you meet your hostess. Because you are early (of course) you are directed towards the bar. Service at the bar is nothing short of excellent! They greet you promptly with coat check and a delicious girly cosmopolitan! Step back we are in heaven!
,,,,,"Sir your table is ready! Oh sorry waitress - or whom ever this angel is - I'm just gracing this cocktail with my lips. Oh what's that? You'll carry my overflowing cocktail to my booth? Sure, why not I don't have anything better to do!"
,,,,,"Oh hello there sir, yes I'll have the time extremely warm bread that is the best bread I've had in 5 years! Oh yes I'll dip that in the glossy not too greasy butter you threw down for me. Yes let me breath in this steakhouse heart warming bread and butter!"
,,,,,"What's that? My order? I completely forgot that I was even at dinner? I'm on my second cocktail and I've forgotten my name, my location, my words - what is true  and what is reality...."
,,,,,Oh! Yes I'll have the 16oz Ribeye Medium-Rare with Bone Marrow and Creamed Spinach. Thank you for your help - I was lost in your comfortable furniture.
,,,,,"As all the food comes out, my mouth rips open in absolute amazement! *Takes bite of steak and Bone Marrow* *Clearly shutters* THIS IS! This is! Nothing but pure ecstasy!!!   Clearly the best food I've ever graced with my taste buds. "
,,,,,"At this point I'm about to get up and start running marathons, my body physically cannot handle the likes of the food triathlon that occurred in my mouth. The creamed spinach had me doing double-triple backflips when the steak had me doing cartwheels!"
,,,,,"Wait the food was the best? What about the service? I'm glad you asked, the service was great! The manager even spent - 15 minutes listening to me rant and rave about his restaurant."
,,,,,"Should you come? It's literally a shame if you don't. I'm feeling bad right now, you are reading this right now; you aren't eating my meal...."
,,,,,This is a great date spot. It's romantic warm atmosphere with delicious food and cocktails is always dependable. I love their Lillet Rose martini and Prime Beef French Dip Sandwich. Service is always excellent. You can dine on their outdoor patio or interior bar/dining room. They are 100% cash less and cannot break change if you want to leave cash tips for wait staff.
,,,,,"Wonderful experience at another one of the Hogsalt restaurants. Having been to 4 Charles and Au Cheval in New York I had high expectations for Bavette's and all of my expectations have been met. The atmosphere is intimate and speakeasy like. The service is impeccable and the food is top notch. Highly recommend the Ribeye, and the Cheeseburger. Also recommend the side of bacon, very thick, fatty and delicious. For desert, the chocolate cream by is to die for and a must order. I will certainly return if I am ever back in Chicago."
,,,,,"The service was good as usual, but my filet was not as good as before. It was chewy and fatty!  The favor was also very bland.  All this being very unusual as they normally have the best steaks, I've ever had."
,,,,,Absolutely amazing! My first steakhouse in Chicago while visiting from Houston. I love the vibe. It's not stuffy and proper like a lot of steakhouses I've been to. Very laid back and classy. 
,,,,,We three girls shared the bone in filet and aged rib eye. Loved the stark contrasts between the meats. The ribeye was more unique due to the char and flavor but the filet was still solid. I liked sharing both. 
,,,,,Their bread is the bomb. The freshest sour dough with salted butter omg. Our waitress was so kind and brought us lots after she saw us stuffing our face with it. 
,,,,,Their chocolate mouse cake was also delicious! It was on the house since we were celebrating a birthday. 
,,,,,Highly recommend and can't wait to come back!! (For a very special occasion since it's quite the $$$)
,,,,,My fiance and I loved it here. The vibes and food are great and Erik (our server) was so wonderful.
,,,,,"Also, try the vacherin for dessert! It's really good (fresh and light)."
,,,,,I can't believe I'm so late in my review of this awesome steakhouse!
,,,,,We visited here in September and it did not disappoint. The ambiance and decor was smooth and inviting. The hostess and waitress were warm and friendly. Definitely made a good start to the evening. 
,,,,,Bestie order oysters and I got my usual wedge salad. Both were delicious. She said her oysters had good flavor. I took her word for it as I'm not a fan of seafood. We both ordered Ribeyes with a family style peas and shallots and roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
,,,,,The steaks were cooked beautifully. So smooth and buttery. The roasted garlic mashed potatoes were the truth! Loved the pieces of roasted garlic sitting on top. The peas and shallots were fine. 
,,,,,Now. Desserts. We ordered salted caramel ice cream. OMGoodness. They also provided 2 toppings: hot fudge and goldbrick. Listen. This goldbrick was life altering. I'm usually a hot fudge fan but the goldbrick was amazing! If you've ever eaten a Haagen Daz ice cream bar with nuts...it tastes exactly like the chocolate coating! She also brought a slice of chocolate pie for us to taste. It has fresh whipped cream and was soooooo decadent. 
,,,,,So far this tops all the steakhouses in my book. Make a reservation today. You will NOT be disappointed.
,,,,,"Special occasion or just a night out on the town, Bavette's is an excellent option. In fact all of the Hogsalt restaurants are good to great. I've dined in for birthdays, NYE and to satisfy random steak cravings. Service is consistently attentive and friendly. Certainly one of the best steakhouses in Chicago. Bartenders are top notch too. I vouch for the deliciousness of everything I photographed."
,,,,,"One of my friends mentioned Bavette's was his favorite place to grab a steak in Chicago, and I now see why. I won't forget Bavette('s)! (See what I did there?) Anyway, let's jump right in. "
,,,,,"I'd say from a ""fancy"" perspective, this is a hair below some of the ""famous"" Chicago steakhouses - while there aren't white tablecloths adorning the wood tables, they also are pretty affordable in my opinion. I mention this because I'm very cognizant about the ""bang-for-buck"" factor of any restaurant. "
,,,,,"4 of us were promptly seated on a Wednesday evening for a 5 o'clock reservation. Notable because: while the time isn't ideal for dinner per se, I do think to get a reservation for a steakhouse of this caliber, and for the neighborhood (River North area) is somewhat significant. What was interesting is we were given 2 choices for a reservation - 5pm or 9:30. But over the course of our dinner, there were still a few empty tables, 4-tops at that, which made us question why our reservation times were so slim?"
,,,,,"Decor is great. Very low lighting, all dark-finished wood, booths were comfortable for 4/5 dinner guests, and the waitstaff was very professional, yet engaging and social. Transitioning to comment on the atmosphere; it didn't feel stuffy. More or less, if you look ""presentable"", you can come as you are. One standout aspect, is they have a bring-your-own-wine feature. I don't know of many steakhouses of this stature which allow this. My friend brought a bottle of wine, and the waiter let us know about the sharing aspect of the restaurant:"

,,,,,"I personally think this is a brilliant idea. This encourages community, in the form of a small yet goodwill gesture. "
,,,,,"I'm supposed to talk about food right? OK. Started with the bread they serve, and ordered their Wedge Salad - incredible. A full size served 4 very well, and they have homemade bacon cubes which are to die for. Excellent way to start the meal. "
,,,,,"We all got a 6-10 oz. filet - and they were very good. Cooked to perfection (medium is the only way, grow up if you order your steak any more cooked), and while they say a good steak shouldn't need any sauce, I did find the creamy sauce they provided very tasty. It didn't ruin the integrity of my steak."
,,,,,"The sides we ordered included: Candied sweet potatoes, Brussels Sprouts, Truffle Mac & Cheese, and the Pommes Frites - these were all really good, my favorite may have to be the Brussels sprouts by a hair; they were flavored very well. "
,,,,,"I'm new to Chicago, and I believe this is important to mention as I'm coming from a pretty unbiased opinion regarding ""fine dining"", especially for a steakhouse. Overall I had a fantastic experience and I will certainly return again to explore more of the menu or revisit favorites. There's also a downstairs lounge which I'll be interested to explore. Right off the brown line Kinzie St. stop, so it's fairly easy access as I came directly from Hyde Park. This will serve well for a fancy dinner with a loved one or friends. Call me a prisoner of the moment but I don't see why I shouldn't give this place 5 stars...so I will."

,,,,,Which pictures could do it justice - but the food and service is incredible. Got the tomato and bacon salad - amazing. Always get the bone marrow with your steak!
,,,,,The restaurant is gorgeous and there was nice jazz and blues music playing. Dinner was delicious and service was amazing! Our carrot cake was complimentary for our anniversary dinner
,,,,,"This should be a restaurant that everyone in Chicago should try at least once. If you don't have the money, save up for the experience! It was sincerely one of the best experiences I've had eating steak. The sides were just as good as well! We got the dry aged bone in rib-eye, filet mignon, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and mac and cheese. Seriously can't go wrong with anything! I already want to go again haha!"
,,,,,"The food and drinks were great, however I thought it was a little over hyped and expensive. The sides were great but the steaks / seafood main dishes were good but nothing exceptional. I enjoyed the ambiance and the decor inside. I think this would be a great place for a work dinner with a larger group if you can get a reservation.  The staff was great - very knowledgeable and attentive. Hope to come back here post covid so I can bring my own wine as well."
,,,,,"In Chicago, Bavette's for a good steak is a great choice.  The vibe of the place is classic steak house with brick walls.  The bread is amazing...so fresh with a great crust. The wedge salad is fantastic, and the steaks!!!!  Our server was very good.  If you can get a reservation, grab it."
,,,,,"What a chic place for dinner, perfect for a date night or an intimate dinner. "
,,,,,"We had reservations to celebrate my birthday, and the entire front of the house staff were completely accommodating and welcoming. The service was impeccable, as our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and offered his pro tips in recommendations. "

,,,,,"Bavette's is a fantastic restaurant. Our server, Frank, was delightful, too. I haven't eaten at many steak places in Chicago but I don't think I'm going to be looking for a a better one. I'll just go back to Bavette's."
,,,,,"Still our favorite high-end restaurant in the city. We dined outside during COVID and the food and service wowed us again. Great care was taken for cleanliness, distancing, etc. We ordered far too much food for two people, but that's the way it goes here! The complimentary house bread sounds underwhelming given the menu here, but it's from a great local bakery and is worth trying. The wedge salad is phenomenal, if for no other reason than it comes with their great bacon. Tried the shrimp scampi this time and it was great as well - very decadent and rich. The steaks were great as always. My wife got the filet and it was perfectly cooked and cut like butter. I got the steak frites for the first time and it was incredible, and a great value to boot. The frites come with garlic aioli like you'd get at Small Cheval. For a side, we got the truffle mac with bacon added and it was the out of this world delicious and over the top. As always, got the chocolate cream pie to go so we could eat it when we weren't busting at the seams."
,,,,,Amazing Valentine's Day experience that fell short of 5-stars due to one of our steaks not being top quality. 
,,,,,"Drinks: Fun and unique BYOB policy. You can bring a bottle of wine as long as you share a glass with somebody else in the restaurant. In our case, we shared a glass with the chef. "
,,,,,"Appetizers: We got the Garlic Shrimp de Jonghe and the Wedge Salad. The shrimp were amazing, the butter/garlic/sherry combination made them very rich and delicious. Our waiter helpfully pointed out that ordering the wedge salad also satisfies the bacon craving, as it comes with some healthy chunks of bacon. The salad was great as well with chunks of blue cheese, egg, and ranch dressing. Although I think the kitchen was a little heavy handed with the dill that day which overpowered a few bites. "
,,,,,"Sides: With only two of us, we only got one side so we could try to save room for dessert so we chose the Elote Style Corn which was very unique to see at an upscale restaurant. Great taste with a little kick and it was not a super heavy side so that was nice. "
,,,,,"Entrees: My wife got the 6oz filet and ordered it medium, and it was super tender and cooked perfectly. I ordered the 16oz strip steak (not on the menu) and although it was cooked a perfect medium rare, the steak itself was too tough. With a strip you don't expect the tenderness of a filet, but I order strips a lot at restaurants and this was definitely too tough. "
,,,,,"Dessert: Chocolate cream pie with oreo crust. Enough has been said about it, just get it. "
,,,,,"Service and Atmosphere: Our waiter Brandon was attentive without being overbearing, and he showed knowledge of the menu and provided us with tips and his favorite dishes. The ambiance is perfect for a night out with your significant other or good friends, with classic music, dim lights, etc. Definitely a cool vibe that is different than a lot of other steak houses. "
,,,,,Overall it was incredible meal with the exception of my steak that was too tough.
,,,,,"I'm not from Chicago, but when I'm there, I come here. One of the best restaurants that I've ever been to. The ambiance is incredible, with a dark, old school setting. The steaks here are always good. Pricey but well worth it. Highly recommend."
,,,,,Great meal.
,,,,,Solid wine list.
,,,,,Service was thoughtful and outstanding.
,,,,,"They have a wine ""little known secret"" BYOB policy."
,,,,,One of my favorite joints. 
,,,,,I'm praying they survive COVID.

,,,,,"Fantastic service, disappointing food. Wanted to love this place (especially after they took such great care of us) but they really missed the mark. Asparagus was extremely under cooked and I wasn't a fan of the bearnaise, as I found it a little sour. However, both of our steaks were cooked to perfection!"
,,,,,"Incredible experience. The food was amazing, as was the service. Erik and Rahul made the whole meal even more exceptional. Highly recommend this restaurant and these servers!"
,,,,,"Bavette's is one of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. The service was top notch from the moment I walked in. I made a reservation a few days in advance, so I was able to snag a high top bar table for one. I ordered a whiskey sour with egg white, and the cocktail was great. I normally don't get too excited over bread, but the housemade sourdough and salted butter is divine. ""Don't fill up on it though"" is what I had to remind myself over and over again. For my main course, I ordered the 22 ounce 42-day dry aged bone-in ribeye and a side of buttery mashed potatoes. The steak came out cooked perfectly. The charred outside gave way to the most tender, soft medium rare deliciousness. The mashed potatoes were heavenly. If I had to pick my last meal, this would be it. The ambience of the restaurant is so swanky and cool. The dimly lit steakhouse feels more like a speakeasy. While I dined alone, this would be the perfect date night spot that would certainly impress."
,,,,,"Our favorite place to go hands down in the city (or anywhere for that matter). Even with the awkwardness of COVID and finding that balance of mask etiquette Bavettes somehow mastered that to! Went back for first time in a year for our first dinner out after our son was born and for my wife's birthday. Our Waitress Erika was phenomenal! She explained the mask expectations and made it seamless. The old fashioneds are always spot on, west cost oysters were fresh and paired perfectly with sauces. The bone marrow is a must, dry aged ribeye cooked perfectly with a flavorful char. Paired with elotes corn, Brussel sprouts and the truffled Mac. Can't wait to go back!"
,,,,,"Hands down our favorite special occasion dinner in the city - amazing steaks, complimented with even more amazing side dishes. Worth every penny!"
,,,,,"Superb steakhouse with great food & service. I had the special 8oz Wagyu Steak Frites, Apple Pecan Salad, Elote Corn,Complimentary house bread, Key Lime Pie Merange. Everything was perfect!  Don't miss this great experience in Chicago!"
,,,,,"Bavette's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The first time I came here was back in January with two of my friends. We were seated in the basement which had a very cool vibe. It was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was stunning. We brought a bottle of wine with us since if you bring a bottle and share a glass with someone at another table, the corkage fee is free (otherwise it is $50.) It was so fun to pick out who to give the wine too and had a couple of glasses sent out way. "
,,,,,"For the appetizer we ordered a truffle mac and cheese to split and once having a bite, I instantly regretted sharing this dish! It was hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The sour dough bread that is complimentary is also amazing and great to dip into the leftover cheesy sauce. "
,,,,,"For my meal, I got the rib eye steak frites (substituted frites with mashed potatoes) and again I was wowed, hands down the best steak I ever had. We finished off the meal with espresso martinis which were soo good and a great end to the meal. Since then I have been back twice, the latest during the pandemic on their patio and each experience has been as good as the first. Highly recommend checking this place out!"
,,,,,Marvelous lower bar with a relaxing vibe- perfect for winding down after an encumbersome workday.
,,,,,Came here recently for the first time and I was extremely impressed. The photos did not do this place justice. The customer service was wonderful and the staff is very calm and relax. They don't make you feel rushed at all and the food came out extremely fast. I was not expecting it. I definitely would recommend this place and I would go there again. Thank you again for the great night out :)

,,,,,"Amazing service, food and ambiance. The aged rib-eye is my favorite in the city so far. Can't think of any complaints - bravo, Bavette's!"
,,,,,"Wow. What a meal and experience. The atmosphere is great. The food was amazing. From the drinks to the seafood to the steak, the sides and dessert. All were delicious. The service was wonderful as well. Definitely a must if in Chicago."
,,,,,"The restaurant itself was beautiful. I loved the dark jazzy ambiance. Food was pretty good, came for my girlfriends birthday. We're out of town for work. "
,,,,,We ordered the:
,,,,,- 42 Day dry aged bone in ribeye 
,,,,,"It was cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested. The sear was perfect as well. It was a great quality steak, the béarnaise was fire. $85"
,,,,,- Brussel sprouts $15
,,,,,"It was good, nothing spectacular imo"
,,,,,- Creamy Mashed Potato's $14
,,,,,It was ok
,,,,,- Roasted Bone marrow with parsley salad and red onion jam. $22
,,,,,"I love bone Marrow, so this is a must if you're into that kind of thing. Red onion jam was bussin."
,,,,,"Service was mediocre in my opinion, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great, coming from someone who has previously served in casual fine dining. The waiter seemed more of an order taker, then trying to give an experience. When asked if we've dined here before, we responded no. So it being our first time I'd expect more of an spiel then just saying I'll give you some time to look over the menu. I've noticed the server was a lot more interactive and social to his other tables. Also the server asked if we were celebrating anything, even though I put in the reservation that we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. So I was a little surprised, they didn't send anything out for her birthday, just asked if we were interested in dessert, more so just to rack up the bill for his %. So I ordered a chocolate mouse pie, it came with a candle. That was nice, jk not really it was $14. I spent over $200, you would think they'd give a free slice for a birthday celebration. So the meal ended in a bitter note. But that's just me being salty, Overall the girlfriend was happy so that's what matters the most. Overall I'd come back."
,,,,,"Came in on a Saturday to celebrate a birthday. The food was ridiculously amazing! We ordered oysters, bone marrow, shrimp scampi, steak tartare, bone in ribeye, lamb chops, creamed spinach, Brussels sprouts, truffle Mac and cheese, and their whipped potatoes. Not one complaint about anything. Our server was Julio who gave us such a wonderful service! Very happy they reopened for dine in service!"
,,,,,I'm not sure how anyone can give this place less than 5 stars. This place was top 2 best restaurants I've ever been to. The service was impeccable. We ate at the downstairs room and both our server and servers assistant were outstanding. 
,,,,,Drinks: I had a Tokyo old fashion and my wife had a gimlet. The Tokyo old fashion was probably the best old fashion I've ever had. My wife's gimlet was also amazing.
,,,,,"1st course: Bacon roasted tomato. Again the best bacon we've ever had. Roasted Bone marrow was a huge portion size. The jelly, bone marrow, and bread combo was sooo good. "
,,,,,Sides: Truffle Mac and Pommes Frites. Everyone raves about the mac and it was good but not on the level of the other food. My wife loved the frittes but to me it was just pretty good. 
,,,,,Mains: I had the traditional filet mignon and it was delicious. It was definitely a top tier steak but just a tad bit salty for my liking. The bearnaise sauce was excellent! My wife had the fried chicken and it was incredible! The mashed potatoes were soo good! 
,,,,,"Overall I think the food I had researched may have been over hyped for me which lead to unrealistic expectations and the food I came in with no expectations knocked my boots off. This was absolutely worth every penny. We'll definitely be back. I can't say enough about the service, experience, drinks, and of course the food!"
,,,,,"This place was on my bucket list to try out, I have been to every steakhouse in Chicago and this was the only one that it was hard for me to snag a reservation for. I was lucky enough to snag a prime 5 o'clock dinner reservation on a Saturday for my wife's birthday."
,,,,,Upon entering the place looks like a small French bistro it is dark lots of wood beautiful crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and artwork and other tapestries and hang from the walls. 
,,,,,We got a perfect seat with a comfortable booth the only complaint that I could say was this was during the worst heatwave Chicago has ever seen and the air could have been a little better in the restaurant it was a little stagnant.
,,,,,Service here is in peccable you want for nothing someone constantly is watching your water glass to make sure you constantly have it filled to the rim. They bring out quite possibly the best sourdough bread I have ever tasted it was warm and yeasty and his came with this delicious butter that this alone could've been my meal.
,,,,,"For drinks I went with an old-fashioned and my wife went with thel bevettes punch, both were extremely good I felt the price was worth the pour."
,,,,,"For our appetizer we ordered two salads I am myself ordered the avocado crab and my wife ordered the salmon Caesar salad both were absolutely amazing, and we also ordered the duck terrine... I am still dreaming about this dish it was so awesome it came with an orange marmalade jam and of course more of that awesome sourdough bread to spread it on it was a 10 out of 10."
,,,,,"We then ordered our main dishes I went for the 45 day dry aged a ribeye with with roasted garlic on top with a temperature of a medium plus. My wife ordered a fillet with a temperature of medium plus the steaks were the best I've ever had and I have had steaks from around the world. Our sites that we ordered were equally phenomenal, we ordered the Elote style corn the buttery mashed potatoes with chicken jus, and the truffle Mac in cheese it was unbelievable. At this point I felt like I was going to fall into a food coma from all the food it was my wife's birthday and they brought her out a piece of mousse cake with a sparkler on top."
,,,,,"This restaurant lives up to the hype it is some of the best food I've ever had in my life, the only reason why I did not give this a five-star was for a very petty reason, the restaurant charged us for the birthday slice of cake.. The bill was over $400 with tip for two I feel that it is just in bad taste not to give a free dessert for a special occasion. Also out of convenience I wish there was a way they could offer valet you have to walk about half a block to the restaurant from the parking garage it was raining out with 100° heat it was not very comfortable. They also state they validate parking but the validation knocks the price down to $13 you still have to pay."
,,,,,That being said I will definitely be back it was a great meal and a great night.
,,,,,"Incredible ambiance, service, and food. I was so impressed!"
,,,,,We ended up going to a 10PM reservation due to flight delays from California. We're so glad we ended up still visiting this place.
,,,,,Our server was so professional and very accommodating throughout our whole stay.
,,,,,We got some amazing crab cakes that even Gordan Ramsey would be proud of. I got the petite filet mignon and it came with a salad and roasted tomato. The portions were perfect and the steaks were perfectly cooked.
,,,,,We ended with some sparkly (literally) mango sorbet for a sweet ending.
,,,,,You must visit for a special occasion because they will give you a great dining experience. I highly highly recommend this place!
,,,,,Absolutely the best meal and dining ambiance I encountered while visiting Chicago. This is a must visit.  Not only was the food fabulous but the atmosphere was one of the best I seen. The place was perfectly dim lit and well designed with a swanky 1920's French American speak easy feel. 
,,,,,I felt like I was sitting in the same restaurant as Al Capone himself listening to some great Jazz. 
,,,,,"My whole meal was to die for, but I would like to highlight the tenderloin tartar and chocolate cream pie."
,,,,,"What a great experience! The service here was amazing -- our waiter (Joe) was helpful, friendly and always available, but we never felt rushed. The dining room was so beautiful and relaxing. The food was absolutely delicious, and the cocktails were on point as well. We were there for three hours, and it was a perfect way to spend an evening in Chicago."
,,,,,"A perfect spot for anyone looking for a good steakhouse in Chicago. Amazing atmosphere (especially if you sit downstairs), great cocktails, and steak that somehow exceeded expectations. As with any great steakhouse, I highly recommend the beef tartare."
,,,,,218 W Kinzie St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,The dinning room is very dimly lit and intimate. There's jazz music playing. Very cute and cozy vibes.
,,,,,"Smoked salmon Caesar salad: the dressing has this subtle taste of citrus that makes it so refreshing. Every bite is creamy, cheesy, citrusy and little crumbles of the smoked salmon. I like the crunch bits of the house made chips. My boyfriend and I shared the half portion and we still felt like it was the perfect amount with everything else we ordered."
,,,,,22 oz dry aged ribeye: There is a nice char on the steak. It was nice and tender. The Bernadine sauce complimented the steak pretty well. I could do without the steak sauce. We got the bone barrow with the steak. It was such a good bite with the bone marrow. So buttery and rich. 
,,,,,Truffle Mac and cheese: it's so cheesy!! So cute rich and creamy. I have come to the conclusion that I am not a fan of truffle. The smell is very overpowering for me and it might have been way too rich. 
,,,,,"I'm not an avid wine drinker, but the gunfighter Cabernet was very smooth. I like it a lot."
,,,,,"Made a reservation right at the 30 day mark, and so glad I did. There were four of us celebrating my girlfriends 40th, and this restaurant made it even more special. Let's start with the decor-beautiful, sexy, dim lighting, top notch. If you get the pleasure of having Erik as your server, then your experience will be elevated. Erik is funny, friendly, and we all wanted to be his BFF's at the end of our dinner. The special was the 32oz ribeye which was enough for all of us, and soooo flavorful and cooked to perfection. Sides of garlic mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts, delicious.  At the end of dinner, we said no dessert, but Erik brought out ice cream with a candle anyway, and my girlfriend was so happy!  Thank you Bavette's and Erik for a wonderful dining experience and for enhancing our Chicago trip!"
,,,,,Simply put: MY HAPPY PLACE. I feel I should have a standing reservation every 4-6 weeks.
,,,,,"I've been visiting Bavette's periodically since they opened. Amazing food, amazing service and great cocktails. The ambiance is quieter and much more refined than Chicago Cut or Mastro's. It is, however, pretty dark inside. I like the environment, but not everyone will. "
,,,,,"I've never had a bad meal (or bad drink for that matter) at Bavette's. Their menu may not be a vegetarian's dream, but they are super accommodating to dietary restrictions. I've been there with vegetarians and they still had a great meal. "
,,,,,Highly recommended for a nice dinner out!
,,,,,I appreciate the quality of the food for it was like satisfying especially if you are craving it. The place was cozy enough that made you feel comfortable while savoring the taste of the food.
,,,,,"Menu and payment will be via a QR code. The service was exceptional and food tremendous. Sourdough Bread w/ Salted Butter is very good, almost as good as San Francisco sourdough. We typically get the Thick Cut Bacon and one of the Steak options. The 8oz Cheddar Burger is now one thick patty vs two (2) patties - still delicious. Dessert: Always get the Chocolate Cream Pie."
,,,,,"I truly see why this steakhouse is regarded as the best in the city and reservations are scarce at times. Upon entry, your immediately greeted with with extreme hospitality. The waiter assigned to our table was prompt and attentive. The ambience has date night written all over it. We ordered the smoked salmon salad for a starter which was shareable and amazingly good. Then of course the dry aged ribeye steak was the icing on the cake. Best steak I've ever had hands down. Cooked to perfection! Will be visiting again very soon"
,,,,,"The atmosphere is sultry and upscale with decor that complements a casual yet sophisticated experience. Our waiter Joe was relaxed and entertaining as he guided our cocktail and dinner options. The cocktails were creative and delectable. We ordered the Crab cake appetizer which was huge and loaded with fresh lumps of crab, easily enough for two people. Our entrees were the petit filet and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye, both with bearnaise sauce on the side. The steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. We had mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The meal was a classic symphony of flavors. It was my birthday and Joe brought us a gigantic piece of lemon meringue pie. The pie was gratis and delicious. Plan on spending few hundred on your meal. My steak alone was $100, but we decided to splurge because our adult children and their husbands highly recommended Bavettes. It was a perfect evening and my wife and I will be returning for an encore soon."
,,,,,Our server Angie welcomed us in and made us comfortable. Our drinks were delicious and she totally undersold the wedge salad. Every single thing was amazing. Best place on our trip hands down.
,,,,,"Best. Steak. Ever. While on our tour of Chicago for the first time we decided that we needed to try some of this Midwest beef we hear so much about. The first 3 words of this review describes it. Let's rewind for a bit though. We walked in and were greeted by not 1, not 2, but 3 hostesses. All which were smiling from ear to ear and very welcoming. We were a bit early for our reservation but to our surprise, our table was ready in ""The Parlor."" We we're ushered to the back of the dimly lit restaurant and down a staircase to the basement. All candlelit and super cozy, with the sounds of A Tribe Called Quest resonating through the speakers. Win. We started off with 3 east coast oysters and 3 west coast. No gulf coast but that was ok because we eat those in Texas all the time. Both coasts were fresh and we actually tried them with no cracker for the first time and we have been missing out! The next appetizer was the shrimp scampi (6) which was piping hot and sitting in a pool of buttery goodness so tasty we kept it around to compliment our steak just in case(wasn't needed). We then opted for the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye cooked just how we like it...The steak was so tender and had that corn fed beef texture we were seeking. It had the perfect char on the outside and just the right amount of pink on the inside. We chose the Buttery Mashed potatoes as suggested by our server and the Truffle Mac and Cheese. We asked for it with bacon because everything tastes so much better with bacon! The cheese was absolutely perfect and the bacon....thick chunks which tasted like they may have been marinating in a sweet sauce. I don't know but I could eat about 3 pounds of that stuff. All in all, the service was top notch, the ambiance was top notch and the food was top notch. I recommend you figure out a way to get to Bavette's as fast as you can! Recommend"
,,,,,One of the best steakhouse in town ... period !!!! Be prepared to wait for a long time to get seated though!!

,,,,,We were looking for a steakhouse while visiting in Chicago and this one was recommended a lot. We booked a reservation for a Thursday night and I am glad we did because it was pretty packed! It was really dark but the interior was nicely decorated. The restaurant had good music and a cool vibe to it. 
,,,,,The restaurant has a really interactive BYOB policy. You can bring a standard size bottle of wine (750ml) per two people. If you want to avoid the corking fee all you have to do is share a glass with another table. We sent a glass out and we received a glass. It was such a fun experience! 
,,,,,"For food we received complimentary fresh sourdough bread which was warm and toasty. We started with the baked crab cake which was phenomenal, the sauce was perfect. We ordered the classic ribeye chicago cut and it was cooked perfectly (we asked for medium rare). The meat was tender and juicy. The loaded baked potato was the perfect side, I am surprised it came out with two potatoes! We also received a free ice cream since we were dining for my birthday."
,,,,,Definitely recommend this steakhouse in Chicago and I would eat here again if I ever go back to visit!
,,,,,"Bavette's is by far my favorite steakhouse in the US! That's right, I said it. Bavette's is the best kept secret in Chicago.. but it's not quite a secret anymore because folks are finding out it's 10x better than Gibson's, Prime&Provisions, etc. Be sure to snag a reservation because walk-ins for 2 will be an hour wait even mid-week. Bar seating is first come first serve though & serves full menu. The atmosphere is swanky historic with very dim lighting; they've got a downstairs parlor with a speakeasy feel too! The service is just top notch too."
,,,,,Drinks: they make a damn good old fashioned! They also have a great selection of wine by the glass & bottles too. Highly recommend their cab or Sangiovese with your steak!
,,,,,"Starters: Definitely get the warm sourdough & fresh butter to start with. If you're wanting a starter, try their bone marrow- its 5 bones with fresh bread & the most savory onion jam you've ever had! You can also just get an add-on to your steak dish if you don't want the whole order. They also have a great seafood selection!"
,,,,,"Entrees: The best steak is the bone-in 42-day dry-aged ribeye because it's sooo rich & cooked perfectly, and the buttery bernajse sauce complements it so well (though it's great just with the salt rub!). If ribeye isn't your thing, the filet is so tender you can cut with a butter knife. My favorite sides are the button mushrooms, cream spinach, or pomme frites with super-rich garlic aioli. I've never had dessert but I'm sure they are divine!"
,,,,,"All in all, you should definitely put Bavette's at the top of your list if you're looking for a wonderful experience in downtown Chicago... I guarantee you'll be glad you did :)"
,,,,,"Classic Chicago steakhouse with great food and great, also classic, ambiance. Everything we had was top notch quality. Amazing crab cakes, and really high quality meat. The bone marrow was to die for too."
,,,,,Probably my favorite steakhouse ever (though I haven't been to many to be fair).
,,,,,"But out of all of them (Alexander's in SF, Ruth Chris, etc.), I really enjoyed the experience and the food here."
,,,,,The ambiance is dark and feels like another time period - our waiter was animated and courteous. And the steak - I think we ordered one of each - so good!! I would have mayyyybee wanted a bit more crust for that crunch - but the flavor of the aged steak compared to their already prime cuts was just awesome.
,,,,,"For sides, Iiiii think we got all the popular things - and they're definitely well-made but I wouldn't say they're amazing. Brussels Sprouts, corn elote, and I believe a mac and cheese... It's like, if you're looking for pure value, I would skip these fillers and go for pure meat. But if you're looking to round out your meal with flavors changes, then these 3 are solid choices."
,,,,,"Really just an awesome place to either go romantic mode or have a memorable celebration at. Also, there's like a psuedo-secret lower floor which has fancier booths and a different ambiance (more classy, quieter) but the normal floor's liveliness has its own charm. I think you can choose which you want provided there's availability - just wanted to let you know!"
,,,,,"Visiting Chicago for the first time with my husband for our 4th wedding anniversary. This was the first restaurant we visited there and I can't say enough about how delicious and authentic the food is!!! The servings are pretty big so we had a salmon Caesar salad, the garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese and the shrimp scampi. My husband also had the best old fashioned ever, made by Emily, our server. Emily was simply amazing! She was extremely patient and helpful, and made sure that we enjoyed our experience. I highly recommend this place, just make sure you leave enough room to eat because you will need it!!!"
,,,,,"My boyfriend was craving steak, so we decided to take the plunge, and order takeout over the weekend. "
,,,,,"I definitely see Bavette's being a special occasion only meal, but hey...it's the middle of a pandemic, so literally any day should be special if you want it to be! "
,,,,,"Of course, nothing can compare to dining in person, but I still had very high hopes after reading all of the stunning reviews. "
,,,,,"We ordered the petite filet mignon (6oz seems small, but it was the perfect amount for me), ribeye steak & frites, truffle mac, and Brussels sprouts. "
,,,,,"Complimentary additions that we discovered in the bag included a sprout salad, and an ENORMOUS loaf of crusty bread with a side of butter. "
,,,,,"Nothing about the meal was disappointing. The steaks were perfect even though they had to hold up through a short drive. I've been to other steakhouses in the area that boasted amazing steaks, but fell short. The petite filet mignon literally melted in my mouth, and the sauce that accompanied it was a great touch. The sides were perfectly seasoned, and I was happy that the Brussels sprouts hit the mark whereas most places tend to over-sauce them. "
,,,,,"Yes, it was a bit pricey, but between two people, we were actually able to make two full meals each between the first day and the leftovers (which were still delicious reheated - - unsure if reheating a meal like this is a faux pas or not but no shame!) "
,,,,,I can't wait to have the full dine-in experience someday in the future!
,,,,,Get the wedge salad.  Seems counter intuitive at a Steakhouse but trust me.  It was the star of the show in a phenomenal experience.  The drinks were outstanding.  Service was exceptional.  Everything we ordered tasted amazing.  We had a 1015pm reservation on a Sunday.  I was so concerned we were going to be those assholes holding the entire restaurant up from going home.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The restaurant was busy and the staff made us feel like we could have stayed for hours.  My friends who dined with me were in town the next two nights and I saw them both nights.  The wedge salad came up everytime I saw them until they left town.  Get the wedge salad.
,,,,,"It's my day off and I decided to dine in a fine restaurant for dinner and go to Bavette's Bar and Boeut. The place is a bit dark romantic which is such a nice ambiance. There were a lot of couples and I am all alone but it was okay. The waiter is dressed beautifully, nice and very professional. While I was waiting for my food I eat their complementary bread a sourdough that tastes really good. I had their oyster first and then I had the dry aged ribeye which is cooked perfectly, it is so tender and flavorful. I had mac and cheese for sides that is also  delicious. However, the cocktail I had taste just like the average cocktail but still perfect to end my meal. I had a great time dining in here. The food and service is  amazing but I must say that the price is really expensive, overall it was worth it."
,,,,,"We have been there multiple times and every time our experience is fantastic. Good food, great drinks, classic ambiance. Carol Ann is amazing! She makes tasty cocktails and was fun to talk to when we sat at the bar last time. Definitely order the mushrooms, they are so good! Highly recommend!"
,,,,,We came with reservations and were seated in very timely manner and where we requested which was nice. Hostess was friendly and Francisco was kind and helpful also.
,,,,,The server was very good at times but was also very arrogant and passive aggressive as well his name was Joel. 
,,,,,Our drinks took way too long to get even had to ask him to check on them it was not even busy.  When the meal came I noticed the steaks looked very dark and stiff on the plates..grant it is dark but this was different I could tell. We cut into our steaks and the steak first of all was super stiff and charred on the outside to the extent of burnt thickness exterior no joke. I took a bite and couldn't believe that this would happen not at this so called takes forever to get a reservation and so well sought after to dine in.. literally could not believe I had better cooked steaks at Texas Roadhouse... seriously.. for me to compare the two and come to that conclusion baffles me. I asked my husband how is yours said same as yours. The taste it left in your mouth. I couldn't even...so bitter.
,,,,,"So Joel shows up to table and says how is everything? I said well.. not good. These steaks are burnt beyond recognition. It leaves a horrible taste in mouth..it was not that the outside had a nice char on them as he states or its just the ends it was entire thing. I said look  took my thumb and index finger and pinched the middle of the steak and got so much charr black burnt on my fingers rubbed them together and showed him..the blackness that was there after even seeing it he kept denying saying it was fine. In my head I know better have HAD BETTER. Have dined all over not that I write reviews for every experience. Have had DK steakhouse in Hawaii, Michels Colony Surf in Hawaii traveled and ate in Europe and am a great cook."
,,,,,"But anywhoo he (Joel) still thinks this is how it is supposed to be and I say can they remake these? He said it will take another 30-40 minutes. I said well, what else can we do??? We are not having these burnt steaks. I picked up my plate and my husband's plate who never likes to say anything but when you pay good money you should get..good food.  "
,,,,,"New steaks came out and were great second time, they gave us fresh new sides as well and packed leftovers. We ordered chocolate pie and Joel looked disappointed maybe more time he will have stay late. So he walked away and asked my husband maybe we should take dessert togo instead so he can go home. He said yes. So Joel was at register I told him we will take the pie togo. He took a receipt and ripped it off crinkled it in his hand and let out a huge sigh. Didn't say anything to me just walked towards bartending area. Then reappears after with pie and sparkler. Our reservation was 9:45 We left after midnight nobody else was there but staff."
,,,,,"4 stars Grand Tower some of oysters tasted fishy/old. The Shrimp cocktail, crab, ceviche rest was phenomenal."
,,,,,3 stars for drinks we asked for champagne and cognac not prosecco and gin and too much lemon overpowered taste. The old fashion suppose to have cognac and was 2 sips only.
,,,,,5 stars truffle mac n cheese.
,,,,,5 stars button mushrooms.
,,,,,2 stars wild mushrooms no flavor.
,,,,,4 stars for new steaks that were sent back cooked way better.
,,,,,1.5 stars Joel (server) passive aggressive and arrogant at times.
,,,,,5 stars ambiance and jazz.

,,,,,I will not come back again. The service and food were not good. I highly suspect that the reviews for this place to be not genuine. 
,,,,,We arrived ten minutes early to our reservation and we were not seated until 15 minutes past our reservation time(I had to go to the front desk to ask if there's any issue). 
,,,,,"When we were seated, I asked for some more time to look at the menu and we were not helped until I flagged for the waitress(we waited for another fifteen minutes before we asked for help). The food was served 45 minutes after our reservation time. Our bill total was about $250 and we ordered the 1lb King crab, sizzling shrimp, and classic ribeye. The king crab was stale(definitely not even 1lb), a very chewy ribeye(lots of tendons), and the shrimp was okay. There was a lot to be desired for the amount that I paid for."
,,,,,"I don't understand how this restaurant has received such high ratings. I'm a regular restaurant goer and I believe I paid the least tips in my lifetime(I pay accordingly to the service and separated from the quality of the food). During my high wait time, I can't help but observed that my table was not helped at all. The waitress interacted with almost every table once every 10-15 minutes(to pour water and talk etc.), whereas, my table did not even get that once. I always give the benefit of the doubt, but it doesn't help at all that that my table was the only Asian group too. I also want to point out that the waitress even asked, ""Was the seafood good? It's terrible huh?"". I had initially thought that it was a joke, but after my experience, I'm starting to think that we were intentionally treated this way."
,,,,,"The absolute BEST chocolate pie in the city. Better than Joes Stone Crab, better than wildfire! This place has an amazing atmosphere and a speak easy prohibition feel. Perfect for a date night or good place to go and unwind with a buddy."
,,,,,"Picked Bavette's for my birthday celebration. Sat in the parlor downstairs and loved the atmosphere. Excellent service and fabulous food. Never felt rushed and the waiter was very informative about the menu. Had a French martini to start. Shared the crab stuffed avocado with Bibb lettuce for appetizer. I loved the dressing but if you're not a tarragon fan this dish is not for you. Had the petite filet done perfectly medium rare minus. Just melted in your mouth. Best filet I've had in a long time. Shared the baked potato side which is actually 2 potatoes. Had the sour cream, bacon, cheese and chives on the side. The bacon was the absolute star of this dinner! It was like candy!! Nice glass of Pinot Noir complimented the steak and bacon. They brought out double scoop of excellent chocolate ice cream for a surprise birthday dessert. Definitely recommend dining here!"
,,,,,"An absolute gem of a restaurant!  The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is impeccable.  Angela (Angie) was an incredible server.  She was so nice and made sure I have everything I needed.  The food was five star.  Had the petite duchess cut filet, side of bone marrow, and half baked potato.  Everything was delicious.  The sourdough bread is truthfully the best bread I have ever had and the mixed greens and apple salad was fresh and creative.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Chicago."
,,,,,"I came here with a couple friends this weekend.  This was the second time I had been here, but the first time in a couple years so was excited to try it again.  I'm now convinced this is the best steakhouse in Chicago.  "
,,,,,"We tried to put our name in at 5:30 and was quoted a 4 hour wait.  My girlfriend and I went to Gilt Bar after and put our name in because we wanted to eat around 8 and were quoted around 2 hours.  My girlfriend and I went home and came back around 7:20.  We went to bavette's and hovered around couches, but didn't have much luck.  As we were leaving to go to gilt bar, we got texted that our table was ready at bavette's.  Perfect!"
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I ended up getting the bone marrow and chop salad to start.  The bone marrow was served with a really good sourdough and onion jam.  The chopped salad has the famous bacon and a really good dressing.  For dinner, we shared the dry aged bone in ribeye, the highlight of the night.  Tons of flavor, perfectly cooked.  We shared 3 sides, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and brussel sprouts.  All really good, but nothing that you need to get.  "
,,,,,"Lastly, the service was fantastic.  From the front of the house to the service, it was top notch.  Really enjoyed it."
,,,,,Overall 9.0/10
,,,,,"So happy my husband and I had our anniversary dinner here! We were skeptical at first, but it met and exceeded our expectations. The dim lighting, soft music, and candle lit table made it feel extra special. We ordered the oysters, crab cake, two filet mignon (one bone in one without), Brussels sprouts, and sweet potato. Everything was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Pro tip- order the roasted garlic with your steak!"
,,,,,Very nice vibe. Love it. Great food and even better cocktails. Always satisfied when I leave.

,,,,,"That's what I did.  I sought out the extraordinary, so I didn't have to ask myself that ""What if"" question.  And...."
,,,,,I walked through the door and instantly found myself in another place and time - a  place of my dreams.
,,,,,"It was 1950s France with a sexy, sultry jazz soundtrack and speakeasy ambience, at this spellbinding destination."
,,,,,"The feel is dark and luxurious, but that only adds to the gentille bonhomie of this chic and cavernous den, outfitted with exposed brick walls, mismatched dangling light fixtures and tobacco-brown Chesterfield-style sofas."
,,,,,"If you want to indulge the one you love, this is the place!"
,,,,,"It's sophisticated, luxurious, and one of the most extraordinary places I have ever dined."
,,,,,"Indulgence can be very, very good some days."
,,,,,"I will never forget my experience here because it's the restaurant my now fiance brought me to before he proposed. This place has the best steak I've ever had. Not only do they nail it on the perfect taste & temperature of the steak, but all the accompaniments also knocked it out of the park. This isn't your Gibson's or McCormick & Schmick's, this place caters to the Millennials and they get it RIGHT! Hit up Gilt Bar for Happy Hour and then pop on over to Bavette's for an award winning dining experience."
,,,,,Wow! When I walked in I knew this was going to be a great date night spot. I love the lighting and vibe is first class. The food was amazing and the drinks on point.  Best dinner we had during our trip.
,,,,,218 W Kinzie St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,"By far one of the most amazing dining experiences I've had in 7 years in Chicago. From start to finish, bavettes blew us away. The ambiance is absolutely perfect for a romantic night or special occasion, with candles lit and chandeliers drenching the whole room in warm dim light. The food was insanely good. Don't sleep on the steak tartare which blew me and my date away. We opted for truffle Mac and Brussels sprouts to go along with our New York strip (cooked perfectly btw). The only thing I'd skip would be the Brussels sprouts which lacked seasoning and weren't as tender as they needed to be. Martinis, old fashioneds, and house red wine all did the job. Our server Barbara was great - so attentive and kind but not overbearing. The entire staff ran like a well oiled machine. We did NOT want to leave! Thanks for making my boyfriends birthday so special."
,,,,,"I'm a big foodie and am incredibly honest in my reviews. Trust me when I say, you need to go here. First of all, I went alone. Usually when I go to a nice restaurant alone people look at me odd  , but everyone from the hostess to the busses to the waitress respected me and treated me well. I felt so taken care of. Immediately, they give you the expectations with masks and such (they do very much enforce having your mask on when your server is around so be prepared for this. My server was great and explained his etiquette right off the bat which was extremely helpful. He stood at a distance until I had my mask on but stood at a distance when checking in). The food was PHENOMENAL!!! The old fashion was a great start. Sourdough was delicious and warm. Oysters paired with theirs given sauces were perfect. The wedged salad is to die for. I promise you want to get something with bacon on it!!! Or just a side of bacon . It had a sweet sauce almost like honey over it. My ribeye was perfectly cooked and delicious. Juicy , well seasoned and the sauce paired well.  The entire time, the bussing team and my waiter made sure I had all I needed. My server paired a wine with my steak and I did not regret it. Brought home a peace of chocolate cream pie by the suggestion of my waiter and oh my goodness. Light and easy to eat. Not too overly sweet. The chocolate paired with the cream and Oreo bottom was delightful."
,,,,,"Overall, my experience was top notch. Except to spend to get the best experience: I felt my meal was well rounded and satisfying and did not mind paying what I did. Even the service fee felt fair, COVID hasn't been easy on anyone and if you're dining here you have more than enough money to pay the service fee "
,,,,,"Recommend BIG TIME. You want to eat here. Oh yeah!!! The ambiance!!! SO good. Chill, jazzy vibes. Dark and candlelit. Immediately upon entering, I knew I'd feel comfortable. But do expect it to be dimly lit."
,,,,,"We waited 3 months to grab our reservation here last year for my birthday around this time just to have it cancelled due to Covid. That's okay because we rather be safe and knew we will just come back here when things begin to open again. My wifey surprised me again this year by making reservations here for my birthday. Parking was plenty and very easy on a Thursday evening. Our server Barbara was super nice and wonderful. She was super attentive and made great recommendations. For starters, we had the Crab Cake, which was delicious. I had the Bone In Filet and my wife had the Bone In Ribeye. My filet was one of the best bone in filets I have ever tried. They made it perfectly to my liking. The wife's Ribeye was also amazing. We had 3 sides: mushrooms, elote, and brussel sprouts. Our favorite was definitely the brussel sprouts, but all 3 were very good. We ended the night with a mango sorbet that was a nice light dessert. Now, I can say this is one of my favorite restaurants and will come back again in the future!"
,,,,,"Delivery: Food was delivered perfectly packaged, fresh, about as well as it could be served in the restaurant. The bread and burrata were packaged separately, neither losing anything to time in the container. "
,,,,,"Price: Definitely a little higher priced, but you are getting perfectly cooked, high quality products for your dollar. Well worth it. "
,,,,,"Food: Incredible. Something as simple as mac & cheese or roasted brussel sprouts are taken to the highest level. The mac and cheese is creamy and layered, and that top layer gets just the right amount of char. Mmm!"
,,,,,"What blew me away, perhaps more than anything, was the bread. That is some of the best bread I've had in my life, and along with the tasty burrata (and just a touch of finishing sea salt), it was perfect throughout the meal. "
,,,,,"Oh, and don't forget dessert! Do you like carrot cake? Look no further, this is about as good as it gets! A perfect slice for my wife's extra birthday cake ;)"
,,,,,The food is AMAZING.  
,,,,,The atmosphere is perfect and takes you back in time.  
,,,,,Staff is friendly.. and dined in during Covid and they followed every rule to a T.  
,,,,,I can't wait for them to reopen.
,,,,,"I finally made it to Bavette's for dinner. I sat at the bar and started with a Bavette's punch. It had just the right amount of citrus and sweetness. The sourdough bread and butter is perfection and the shrimp cocktail display is impressive. I tried the short rib stroganoff for dinner. Sadly, I did not love it. The flavor just wasn't for me. I did not want a box so I think they picked up on that and comped the carrot cake I ordered. I unfortunately did not love this either, as it is heavily spiced in both the cake and the frosting. The decor and service is 5 stars. I got there right when they opened and it took about an hour for the bar to fill up so I would get there early if you missed the chance at a reservation. I would definitely stop in again to try some other things. "
,,,,,"I've been to the other location and tried the steak frites, asparagus, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, lemon meringue pie, and chocolate pie. The recipes are the same as here. Everything is good but the chocolate pie is heavier than expected and the mushrooms are a bit heavy on the onion topping. The garlic aoli is amazing and we loved the lemon pie."
,,,,,Celebrated a job promotion here. It was wonderful from start to finish. Server was amazing. Food was excellent. Wagyu steak was melt in your mouth perfect. Truffle macaroni and cheese was amazing. We will be back again.
,,,,,We did not have a reservation and Bavette's but they seated us right away in the bar area. Shiza was our waitress. She recommended a couple things on the menu and we split them. I ordered a dirty Martini with hand stuffed blue cheese olives; which was excellent and my friend did an old fashion which was great. 
,,,,,"It was the best bread and butter with seasonings that we've ever had. Besides the food which was amazing, they brought out a chocolate mousse pie with homemade whipped cream for my friend's birthday that was to die for! If you're in Chicago you must come here; you will not be disappointed!!"
,,,,,"A fantastic showing for a steakhouse atmosphere that is reminiscent of another era. Everything from the start was done well, from the service to the presentation to the flavors!"
,,,,,"We started with a bunch of seafood, including shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster, and oysters from both coasts. This was a great way to kick things off and actually not a bad value when all was said and done (we did create our own)."
,,,,,"From there, it was on to the feature presentation: a bone-in NY strip with steak salt and bernaise, which is standard for their steaks. It was right at the peak of top steaks in Chicago with GT Prime for me right now! Succulent, juicy, salty, and cooked to perfection."
,,,,,"This is an absolute MUST if you enjoy food, and a great atmosphere to boot!"
,,,,,"Phenomenal experience last night at Bavette's. From the ambiance, to the food, to the service, everything was exceptional. "
,,,,,"We dined in the Parlour, their intimate basement area. My boyfriend and I thought the ambiance there was perfect -- dark, quiet, intimate, plush seating, surrounded in stone wall, illuminated by lavish lamps and candles, with a nice view of the elegant bar (which was not in service but we just really loved the vibe)."
,,,,,"For the food, I had my mind set and was excited about the lamb chops, but as I was ordering, the waiter told me that they didn't have any and were taking the lamb chops off the menu. A real letdown, but I changed my order to the same as my boyfriend's, a dry aged New York strip steak. Before the food came, a server brought to us two massive slabs of their homemade sourdough bread and salted butter. Here is, in our opinion, the test of a good steakhouse. The bread was incredibly soft and airy, with a strong sour crust. The butter was immaculate -- the smoothest and creamiest we've ever tasted. "
,,,,,"Onto the steaks and sides... We appreciated that the meat was cut off the bone for us already, taking away the only real con of choosing a bone-in steak. The steaks were cooked perfectly to the temperatures we requested. The dry aging gave the steaks a wonderful depth of flavor. For the sides, we got the loaded baked potato and truffle mac and cheese (our waiter's recommendation). To our surprise, we got two baked potatoes! They were just okay, though. They came with bacon on top and shredded cheddar on the side. The bacon was thick and chunky and tasted like a nice ham -- elegant for sure, just not our preferred take on bacon. The truffle mac and cheese was rich and had so much of that luscious cheese sauce. I would order this side again."
,,,,,"For dessert, we split the chocolate cream pie, and what a sexy looking slice of pie that was. It came with a fat dollop of whipped cream on top. Too much whipped cream for my taste lol. The pie was so decadent and was the highlight of the night. Don't even think about skipping out on this one!"
,,,,,"The service all night was wonderful. The staff was dressed to the nines, always kept my water glass full, and wiped down our table between courses. Our waiter was amicable and made sure we had a fantastic experience."
,,,,,A memorable date night for sure. It was all the little details that made this place so special and worth the splurge. 10/10

,,,,,"Made a reservation at the recommendation of a good friend and the restaurant did not disappoint. The candlelit ambiance was complemented by the good music playing in the background. Service was attentive, cocktails were yummy, wine selection was good, and the food was mouthwatering. Highly recommend. We had the steak, mashed potatoes, oysters, and the bread...all tasty"
,,,,,"I've eaten at Bavette on three occasions.  This is not to be missed.  The atmosphere inside is stunning, the wine list is great, staff is wonderfully friendly and the food is amazing.  "
,,,,,I recommend the downstairs parlor for a table.  The shrimp starter is absolutely amazing and the aged steak is one of the best I've ever had.  I tried some of my friend's mac and cheese and it was great - you can't go wrong with truffle.
,,,,,Amazing is all I can say.
,,,,,"Wow. After finally dining here for the first time, I can't wait to come back. Everything at Bavette's was incredible - the food, the service, and the overall experience. Even the complimentary sourdough bread was delicious. I was only able to take photos of the wedge salad and espresso martinis we ordered because we could not wait to eat anything else. We ordered the wedge salad, goat cheese, burger, filet, truffle Mac n cheese, and drinks, which was probably too much for two people. My favorite was the truffle Mac n cheese but I would order everything else again. Although we did not order dessert, they brought out chocolate ice cream for us to celebrate our anniversary (I noted a special occasion on the reservation). There is a Covid surcharge and about a $2.50 charge per person to reserve a table through Resy."
,,,,,"Okay, by far my favorite steak house in Chicago. The ambiance is sexy and romantic. The service is outstanding. SHOUT OUT TO OUR SERVER JOHN! He truly made our dinner outstanding and went above and beyond to make us comfortable. He knew the menu without hesitation and gave us fantastic recommendations. We ordered The crab cakes, the bone in ribeye, elote, Brussels sprouts and Mac n cheese. I can't tell which one was my favorite because it was all so delicious. Will definitely come back!"
,,,,,If it weren't for the server assistant(busser) or hosts this would be 1 here's why...
,,,,,"Our server forgot each time we ordered what we ordered. Write it down. We ordered several times and each time it was screwed up. No apology, just excuses."
,,,,,Kept reordering.
,,,,,Then our order would be wrong.Again.
,,,,,"Then when we finally got our main course, our steaks that were ordered as med rare/med were BURNT."
,,,,,Burnt. 
,,,,,Didn't even get our sides right. Luckily they were edible. 
,,,,,"We looked forward to this for months and heard such great things. If I am paying this much, I deserve an unburnt meal and EXACTLY what I order. Didn't even get what I ordered"
,,,,,#pathetic #notworthyof5stars
,,,,,"(Btw, we ordered cocktails, a bottle of wine, appetizers, salads, and entrees, then 2 shots. We  actually ordered more, but it wasn't delivered. We weren't being cheap)"
,,,,,Went here for my bday and can't wait to go back. Great atmosphere! Delicious food. Unique drinks. Personable and warm service. Grown and sexy vibe! Wish I would've taken more pics but I was enjoying myself so much I forgot. They make a mean French 75!!!
,,,,,"What a disappointment! We came here based on many recommendations about how great the steaks are here. They were all very underwhelming. The ribeyes were burnt to the point that they almost tasted like charcoal. I ordered the filet mignon and it was so salty that I used the bernaise sauce to tone it down. When you have to use a sauce just to make a filet taste better, there's something wrong with the filet. The sides, however, were great. We got the truffle mac n cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. Sadly, the sides and dessert were the best part of the meal. When we got our $600 bill, we were surprised to see a 4% covid fee. Then on top of that, my sister, who made our reservations and paid $20 to hold our table, was told that the $20 doesn't go toward the bill or waiter. It goes to management. I don't see how this is okay but we will never be back again."
,,,,,"This is my top favorite steakhouse in the US, period."
,,,,,"Visited Chicago for a weekend and I made sure to make a reservation here 13 days in advance for my second time at Bavette's. This is by far the best steakhouse I've been to in the US. The way they dry aged their beef is phenomenal, bringing out a flavor profile that I have not managed to find anywhere else. I didn't pay attention to whether the beef is USDA prime, because I came here for the absolutely incredible dry aging flavor profile."
,,,,,"The atmosphere in the restaurant is romantic with candles lit throughout. Highly recommend taking a date here. I ordered the dry aged bone in rib-eye and gosh, the flavor explodes in my mouth. You come here for the dry aged flavors, and I can guarantee that you will be hard pressed to find another steakhouse that will deliver this quality!"
,,,,,"One thing I would not add to the steak is the maitre'd butter. I made the mistake of ordering this addition, which turns out to be too salty and likely detracted from the flavor of the steak. I'd probably add the garlic if I make it back here next time!"
,,,,,"My wife and I love this spot and come here for date nights as often as possible. Truly a great atmosphere and staff is always great. We had one instance where we felt sick after eating (we had the exact same dish, and same drinks minus one where she had a glass of wine and I had Bourbon) and the team reached out via email, then followed up with a phone call. Went over all their preventative measures, apologized, and made the situation right. 100% sure it was a one off scenario so no hard feelings. Handled very professionally. "
,,,,,"It features a low lit interior both upstairs and down, perfect for a romanic night out. We love to come in and just chat for hours over some nice cocktails and food. Highly recommend this place for dates or just a relaxing evening out with friends."
,,,,,"Wow I had such high expectations for this place. I've lived in Chicago for 2 years and everyone kept telling me to come here. The dishes I enjoyed were the wedge salad, truffle mac n cheese, side of mushroom and the chocolate cream pie. The steaks were extremely underwhelming. We had the bone in ribeye and the classic rib eye. Both were so charred. Every bite was burnt steak. "
,,,,,"Our waiter was awesome, so it has nothing to do with him. I did find it ridiculous that the $20 fee I paid to reserve the table didn't go towards the meal or to our waiter/bussers.  It goes to management. This and the charred steaks both left a bad taste in my mouth. Wish we didn't spend $600 at this place."

,,,,,"Went for Valentine's Day. It's very dark and romantic. There is a 1 hour 45 min time limit but they don't rush you. Bone marrow was amazing and a much bigger portion than I've ever seen; great for splitting. Wine bottle options are reasonable for a steakhouse, especially the house bottles. Steak was cooked perfectly. Pro tip- if you're sharing a steak, ask to have it sliced. Have been here 20+ times and will keep coming back. Never disappoints!"
,,,,,I had months Trying to get a reservation... I finally snagged a reservation for bar seats for $5 online. 
,,,,,Food was really good. Host were really great. I'm a host so I appreciate a nice welcome.
,,,,,I believe our bartenders name was Matt. 
,,,,,"My water was un refilled for a good portion of the meal. I feel like he kept looking at us hoping that we would ask for a check, he was obviously not checking if we needed anything else.. since again, my water was not refilled. At the end he gave us the check without saying anything.. no thank you. My boyfriend and I are industry so these things bothered us."
,,,,,"I would have gave the place 5 star except for an small incident. I got my garage ticket validated at the restaurant, but it didn't work at the pay station and I had to pay $42 for parking."
,,,,,"The food was exceptional. Wedge salad was fresh and crisp, and the bacon on top was fantastic. I would order bacon as side separately next time.  The dry aged steak was very soft and flavorful. We asked for between med rare and medium, and it was cooked perfectly to the spot we wanted. The dressing for steak tasted too strong though. I felt simply some salt is enough to bring the best out of the meat. The cocktails were good too, but a powerful red wine might go better with the steak. "
,,,,,Would definitely return. Street parking next time. There were actually quite a lot street parking spots around on an weekday evening.
,,,,,Impressive! My go to steak house. The service is the best around. Food is always so so good. Try the fried chicken it melts in your mouth! The filet is perfect everytime. Absolute best wedge salad. I can't say enough good things about this place. End the night perfect with salted Caramel ice cream. You won't be disappointed!
,,,,,Another winner!!! I just didn't have the time to try more items. But no worries... I'll be back. 
,,,,,"I also live that they aim to please their customers. You don't dubs this often in Chicago. I'm from the South and that's a norm their. But here, most places have a culture of ""You should be happy to fine here"" instead of ""We're so happy you chose to don't here, how can we keep you coming back"". I miss that most about the South. But they definitely served up Chicago hospitality here. I didn't know that existed until now."
,,,,,"Food, service, ambiance - all excellent! Such a wonderful experience. Highly recommend! Joe, our server, also fantastic. A+!"
,,,,,Really enjoyed the ambience. Service was really good. Loved the Mac and cheese and the ribeye. The espresso martini was delicious! The shrimp scampi was good as well!
,,,,,"Starting with a disclaimer that it's probably been two years since I've been to Bavette's, but I just found a photo of the mac and cheese on my phone and was reminded how amazing this meal was! We came here on Valentine's Day and the whole meal was such a treat and great experience. Besides the BYOB and the delicious food, I distinctly remember our waiter being so kind. I was trying to decide between mac and cheese or fries as my side (yes, I am a mature woman thank you very much) and was really struggling to pick one. I picked fries, but the waiter brought me the mac and cheese too at no charge, because he could tell how badly I wanted to try it. *insert crying emoji* That kind of service is just so memorable, and on top of the outstanding food, made Bavette's a restaurant that I still recommend to friends years later."
,,,,,"Excellent cuisine. The menu is comprehensive and seasonal, with a high level of quality. Definitely a fantastic eating experience. It can be pricey, but it's well worth it, plus they have such a nice theme that is extremely romantic, has dim light that will surely set the mood and is perfect for a dinner date with your loved ones. I came here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary and she totally likes our date that night. The staff are all accommodating and warmly greet us when we enter. We made a reservation here two days ago and I'm thankful that we did that because we got a nice spot. There are a lot of options and it all looks delicious so we had a hard time ordering. It's definitely one of our best nights!  A very memorable one. I highly recommend this restaurant. It's surely expensive but it's worth the price. And next time, we will come here again with our friends."
,,,,,"The Best Steakhouse in Chicago. My boyfriend and I split the Porterhouse and it was the best of both worlds: a filet and a bone in steak. I don't know what's in the mushrooms, but they almost tasted like Carmel, could probably eat a bowl of those to myself. Mac and cheese was also phenomenal with a bit of truffle, but not too overpowering. The ambiance is great: romantic, not too crowded, and a comfortable cute bar.  The champagne cocktail was my favorite: a little bubbly, but not too strong.  I say this steakhouse is the best because of the crisp crust on the steak: I don't think the other steakhouses quite master it like Bavette's. Obsessed with this place and already thinking about our next trip back!"

,,,,,"Amazing food, vibe and drinks. The parlor is great if you want same setting but with some lounge music playing. Filet Mignon melts in your mouth and the truffle Mac and cheese are mouth watering. And lets not let's not forget about the Oysters. Outstanding establishment!"

,,,,,"I just left full, satisfied & in amazement, I am a hard lady to impress when it comes to steak houses. Typically, I'd do a hard pass. Made reservations for 5pm, arrived at 4:45pm and was seated right away. This isn't my first time in Chicago but this is my first time at this restaurant, our waiter Erik H. was outstanding! He was Top 3 best waiters I've ever encountered, from great recommendations, always checking in to ensure we were happy & such pleasant conversations! The ambiance of the restaurant was lovely. Everyone was very kind & great customer service. Can't wait to come back, best night cap!"
,,,,,"We had ordered a dozen oysters, they had 4 kinds & we tried 3. We ordered the truffle Mac & Cheese, Brussel Sprouts, 1/2 pound of chilled King Crab Legs, Dry Aged Bone in NY Strip & lastly the Chocolate Cream Pie. All we're soooo delicious, we don't usually take pics of our food, only videos so I'll attach the best screen shots of the videos."
,,,,,Swanky atmosphere. Great service. Amazing food and drinks. 
,,,,,You should make reservations weeks in advance. Limited parking so you may want to Lyft/Uber.
,,,,,"Best meal I've had in a long time. Food, service and atmosphere all top notch. Salmon and steak melted in your mouth. Huge side dishes! We accidentally left an umbrella behind; they texted to let us know."
,,,,,"Let's just start with the ambiance, dark and moody just like you would imagine if you were living in the 1920 era. The wait staff is absolutely top notch. So welcoming. We started with cocktails, they have a list of old school cocktails I had never tried. I chose the Gimlet(Gin and Lime w/simple syrup). Out of this world! Refreshing. We had their bread brought to the table. One of the best sour dough ever. Next was the wedge salad. Bacon to die for then came the main course the signature ribeye melt in your mouth. I will have dreams about this place for some time to come. If you visit Chicago I would highly suggest this amazing place"
,,,,,"The only negative thing about this meal was that I tried to make a reservation through Resy every day for 30 days leading up to the meal and could not get one. This was honestly the best meal of my life. We went in around 7 pm on a Saturday and were told it would be a two hour wait (which we were prepared for). My brother and I both ordered the Chicago cut 16oz ribeye with truffle Mac & cheese and the pommes frites as our sides. We also both got old fashioned's (mine was Elijah Craig and his was a Japanese whiskey) which we both loved. The steak was cooked perfectly and was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The truffle Mac and cheese was unbelievable. The pommes frites were not unbelievable, but were still pretty good because...fries, you know? This place is absolutely worthy of all of the rave reviews and I highly encourage anyone who is a lover of steaks to visit."
,,,,,"I ve been to this restaurant 3 times in the past. Yesterday we dined here and I will NOT be back with all the choices to fine dine in the city. Bavettes will NOT make the list again. The service was subpar as our waiter Steve should be trained in your liquor list and what you may offer, said they had no bloody mary mix , as we ordered them first? Ordered a bottle of cakebread cabernet and our glasses were never refilled by waitstaff, we poured them ourselves? We were asked to put in our order 3 times as we were eating our salads! We came ti relax, not be rushed out like a breakfast cafe...ridiculous! Had to ask for salt and pepper for salads. I am in the fine dining  industry for 35 years, I know what impeccable service is!! Bavettes falls way short. Pick a different steakhouse as there are many choices in Chicago."
,,,,,"WOW! Absolutely blown away! Celebrated my 30th birthday here and it was one of the best meals we have EVER had in Chicago- maybe truly the best! Service was impeccable, ambiance and decor was incredibly cozy and detailed (as all Hogsalt restaurants are). The sourdough and butter house bread was one of the best pieces of sourdough I've ever had- so warm and fresh with the best crust. We started with the crab stuffed avocado salad and crab cake. The salad was delicious and refreshing. The crab cake at $30 is pretty high, but it was very thick, and almost 100% crab meat (SO GOOD), so definitely worth the price! The steak was cooked to perfection. My husband thinks it was the best steak he has ever had. The fried chicken was impossibly crispy, the mashed potatoes and gravy with it were creamy, rich, absolutely divine. The sundae speaks for itself- such a fun dessert! I can't thank Bavette's enough for one of the best dining experience we have ever had! Set a reminder on your phone for 30 days before your desired date to make a reservation- otherwise it's hard to get in, and we understand why. Thank you again!"
,,,,,"Sat at the bar on a Sunday evening and the food was spectacular: Charred Broccoli, the Truffled Mac-n-Cheese and the Ribeye all top notch. Our server, Emily, was really outstanding. And don't get me started on the Carrot Cake. "
,,,,,Thank you Bavette's. We will be back!
,,,,,"Absolutely amazing. Oysters were fresh and delicious paired with cocktail sauce, hot sauce, lemon, and/or mignonette. We got to select from west or east coast and tried both. I prefer the west coast as they are much sweeter but east coast are bigger. Steaks were seared so well and the steak salt is a very good addition! My only criticisms are that the filet was slightly tough and the bernaise sauce was just alright. But the sides!!!! We got truffle Mac and their mashed potatoes that have garlic confit delicious jus on them and it was excellent. An indulgent meal but top notch service and fantastic food. Our waiter was kind and charismatic!"

,,,,,"A must when in Chicago!! Reserve ahead! Food  was amazing, service was Phenomenal, ambience was excellent. Highly recommend the crab cake. Our server Erick was great and everything he recommended was delicious!!"
,,,,,"10/5 stars says my man. We were fortunate to be taken here by our good friends when visiting Chicago (they booked a reservation way in advance). Our friends were the experts and ordered steak, fried chicken, and tons of sides like mac & cheese and corn. We did not get salad as my friend stated do not waste stomach room on that (hahaha)."
,,,,, All of the food was AMAZING. The steak was so melt-in-mouth and perfect consistency throughout. First bite was just as delicious as the last bite. I really wish I had a second stomach to savor more of the food there.
,,,,,The vibe there was definitely cool! Our friends had brought wine that the restaurant poured for us. We even sent a glass to surprise a couple at another table (PRE-COVID). 
,,,,,Definitely would recommend as a MUST to go to when in Chicago.
,,,,,Great ambience. Food was delicious and filling. Serving can feed 2. I ordered salmon and it was buttery and delicious. The crab cake was bomb. It gives the crab cake a Micheal Jordan steak house a run for its money. 
,,,,,We got seated right away which was nice. Food had to be ordered all at once due to their 90 min dining limit.  
,,,,,"Only take back is they charge a covid 19 fee and also charge a 5,99 fee to reserve a table ; per person. So there's 20 bucks gone on service fees."
,,,,,Great restaurant. 
,,,,,"Service: Our waiter was fantastic, and helped recommend and guide our selections. Kept the water glasses filled and was checking in and friendly/conversational, but not too present. "
,,,,,"F&B: We ordered the Porterhouse Steak, which was perfect for our family of four, cooked to perfection, Brussel Sprouts (the best I've had, and I order this dish often), Mac and Cheese (incredible), and the dessert Chocolate Creme Pie (so silky and good, like a creamy Oreo). The complimentary bread was great too (and huge!) with easy to spread butter with a bit of salt!"
,,,,,"Venue: dark and Moody, perfect for a steakhouse!"
,,,,,"Of note: they will tell you your table is ready and have you step inside. We weren't sure what to do with ourselves and stood awkwardly. There is a little lounge space, feel free to sit there until the host comes to guide you to your table (picture below) - we noticed this was the process for each group."
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,Ambiance: 5/5
,,,,,Service: 5/5
,,,,,"The food was incredible at Bavette's! I ordered the steak frites and Mac n cheese! I ordered the steak medium and I think I would have ordered it medium rare. It was very slightly pink in the middle, but it was still very good! I thought the portion size was good for the price. The Mac n cheese was SO rich, but so amazing! I have an amazing birthday dessert. I was so full by the tome the dessert came, but I was able to save the leftovers! The ambiance and restaurant is so well decorated! It almost felt like a speakeasy inside! Our waitress was so sweet and great! I would highly recommend this place to someone looking for a high end steakhouse in downtown Chicago."
,,,,,An awesome place for drinks and steak. 
,,,,,I recommend the old fashioned as a beginner.
,,,,,The Chicago cut rib eye was outstanding. 
,,,,,The service was top notch.
,,,,,Enjoy!
,,,,,There is a reason why my wife and I love this place.
,,,,,"Not only do they serve delectable food, create superb cocktails, and provide ambience that is unmatched.  The true stars are all the staff that work here."
,,,,,Everyone we have meet whenever we visit has always been kind and personable.  
,,,,,"Now with kids we are not as free to frequent this restaurant as often as we would like, but as soon as we get the chance for another date night we will be back."
,,,,,"This place is amazing. Their beer selection is poor, but otherwise it's perfect."
,,,,,"The food is to die for. I don't think I've ever had a better steak. And the sautéed mushrooms are not only really good, but the sauce in them makes for a great sauce for the steak."
,,,,,The bread is the best we've had anywhere in Chicago (and we've been to most of the steak houses).
,,,,,Sinsational!!  One of the best meals ever !! They do things to the food that take it to another level. The Classic Ribeye was perfect.  The fried chicken is the best I have ever eaten. The truffle Mac and cheese is highly addictive.  We also had the Bibb salad with crab and Avocado that was fantastic and a meal in itself.
,,,,,"Despite covid they have not bit skipped a beat. We sat inside most recently and wore masks until we got to our table. Our server wore his mask the whole time. Of note, this was back in feb. "
,,,,,It remains the best place to get the most perfect steak in Chicago. This is a fancy night out to be sure but everything tastes great. 
,,,,,"I'm always impressed by the service. Trained impeccably, they can tell you if there is a certain spice in a dressing. Their level of knowledge and kindness in accommodating is spectacular. If you want a really romarins night, request downstairs."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,"My family has been going here for years, 5 stars for the bread ALONE! Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the cocktails are so amazing. Highly recommend. The only downside is they have a very high covid charge which is still in place as of June 2021, I think it may be time to remove those"
,,,,,WOW WOW WOW!
,,,,,"I can honestly say that this was one of the best restaurants we have been to.  The decor was cool jazz and the service was beyond fantastic.  But the star was the food.  From the Marrowbone and salad (lyonnaise) to the bone in Rib-eye to the most delicious mashed potatoes EVER, everything was perfect.  Even the chocolate pie was great."
,,,,,It was not a cheap meal but we'll worth it.
,,,,,"This place was delicious. I should have taken more pics. We had the shrimp cocktail, the fried chicken , and a few sides. Everything was delicious. Oh and the chocolate pie was amazing!! The best part was our server. She was amazing. Just very sweet, felt like an old friend. Really made us feel welcomed and taken care of."
,,,,,Celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary here and I'm so happy. The ambience was mellow with great music playing in the back ground. Everything from the starters to the desserts and drinks was a hit! I honestly didn't want to stop eating. 
,,,,,The bacon that came on the tomato salad was as if it was riblets. The Tokyo whiskey was smooth and intoxicating. The steak melted in your mouth. Everything was absolutely delicious.
,,,,,"Please forgive, It's been a minute and I may be a bit dry on creative writing juices; but the juices of that 42 day dry aged bone-in Ribeye might just propel me into something that is at minimum, a palatable read, and at best, a review worthy of my 5-star rating of Bavette's."
,,,,,"If anyone knows me I tend to eschew restaurants in which, on the surface, lore supersedes the actual experience of a place.   Even if i'm cutting off my nose to spite my face, as they often never reach that monumental expectation. But in the case of Bavette's, thanks be to God, or my GF as it were, she took my B-day dinner plans into her very capable hands and made a reservation."
,,,,,"The Setting:  Nearly perfect.  Low lit, gorgeous space that is as inviting as it is comfy, cozy, mood setting sensational. "
,,,,,The Service:  
,,,,,"Very good and while not as exceptional as every other detail of this experience, I have nothing whatsoever bad to say.  Our server was cordial, if not a bit utilitarian at times, sticking to the basics but certainly  knowledgeable enough nonetheless."
,,,,,The Drinks: 
,,,,,"Sazerac, High Ball, House Red. All good.....but alas, a complete afterthought to why you come here - (this ain't your Aviary and doesn't pretend to be)."
,,,,,The Bread Service: 
,,,,,"I mean really, had we not ordered the Bone Marrow (Butcher's Cut) that accompanied the same char-grilled Sourdough bread, I might have something interesting to say. I will however, state that  the salted creamy and oh so dreamy butter it came with was noteworthy so there's that."
,,,,,The Food: 
,,,,,"Part 1a - The aforementioned Butcher's Cut Bone Marrow. I'm not sure  how this metaphor or analogy or or whatever we want to call it will flow, but here goes.  If there is a correlation to be drawn with how bad something probably is *for* you with how good it actually is, this is it.  Health-wise, the very nature of Bone Marrow is akin to smoking cigarrette's. It just can't be good for you but we do it so rarely, caution shall be thrown to the wind!"
,,,,,"Part 1b - Classic Wedge. How do you next level a classic steakhouse salad like this ?? I present to you:  Exhibit A.   Incredible presentation, totally unique, and exquisite taste. #justwow."
,,,,,"Part 2a - You don't do an $80 steak often so when you do there is no margin for error. And the BOH of Bavette's just nailed it! Medium-Rare (+) - yes, they accommodated and that little nuance of temperature did everything it could to bring this steak to one of, if not the best i've ever had.  Details aside, it was an experience like no other.  And if you even try to mess with the simple seasoning treatment they afford this steak, you're doing yourself a disservice.  Leave it as is and let this month long + dry aged steak shine!  "
,,,,,"Part 2b: Garlic Confit Mashed  Potatoes. Like the butter w bread service above, it was as creamy and dreamy as you can imagine. No, not an afterthought, but a perfect accompaniment."
,,,,,Part 3: Chocolate Cream Pie.  Just when I think Bavette's cannot top themselves what do they do?  Top themselves. I can't even describe how silky smooth and incredibly sublime this was. So I won't.
,,,,,tl;dr: Shut up and GO!
,,,,,I tried to get a dinner reservation for 3 months to this place. Holy crap was it worth it!  I can't say I'm the most supportive human of Covid restrictions & Bavettes is very strict on their health safety so I was a little put off by all the prerequisites prior to showing up for the reservation but I decided to give it a go anyways. If that wasn't the best decision of 2021 I don't know what is!  
,,,,,"So we sat down and immediately were in awe of the vintage rat pack decor/music.  Totally set the mood from the old school jazz to the dim lighting and brick walls.   We started with some elijah craig old fashions which were perfect and had a spice to them which we have yet to decipher what the spice was. We ordered the oysters, so fresh, so delicious.  Both of us decided on the 16oz chicago cut ribeye.  Perfectly cooked. No need at all for the steak seasoning they give you on the side or the bearnaise sauce.   The seasoning was just right.  We also ordered a side of truffle mac n cheese (better than mine and that hurts me to admit) and roasted broccoli.  We were in caloric heaven. "
,,,,,After an old fashioned and cognac zepherac for me and a dirty martini for my boyfriend we decided to cap the meal off with 2 espresso martinis and carrot cake.  The carrot cake was delicious and the espresso martini was made with ACTUAL FRESH ESPRESSO.  It was the perfect pick me up to a heavy decadent meal.  We will be back soon Bavettes. Thank you for the perfect date night!
,,,,,"Bavette's Bar & Boeuf is truly and amazing dining experience. From the service, to the ambiance, and the food Bavette's nails it all. "
,,,,,"My friend and I started with the Tenderloin Steak Tartare. Then for the main course we had the Dry-Aged Bone in New York Strip and the Dry-Aged Bone in Ribeye. Enhanced with Gorgonzola and roasted Bone Marrow. As for the sides, we had Broiled Asparagus, Mashed Potatoes, and Truffle Mac & Cheese. "
,,,,,These were all amazing dishes and I would highly recommend them. Especially getting the enhancements done the steak.
,,,,,I would recommend reserving a table ahead of time as it was full when we got there. You can reserve online and each reservation ticket costs about 2.23 per person. 
,,,,,Overall great experience and would recommend Bavette's Bar & Boeuf if you are looking for a great steak in the City of Chicago!
,,,,,It is super hard to get a reservation here. You pretty much have to be on resy right when they release a new date. I also had to pay $2 per person to hold each seat (does not go as a credit). 
,,,,,Service was fantastic and I love the atmosphere. We sat in the parlor which was nice but I thought the chandeliers in the dining room were gorgeous. 
,,,,,I had the petite fillet and thought the outside was too charred. Overall it was pretty good though. 
,,,,,The mashed potatoes are way too pasty. The texture is thick and pasty. I would skip these. 
,,,,,"The macaroni and cheese was delicious, I would get this again!"
,,,,,Next time I want to try the elotes and the chocolate cream pie. The salad options were also unique and they had individual sizes. 
,,,,,The bacon was good. The sourdough bread was also delicious.
,,,,,"I've been wanting to try Bavette's for ages now and finally did last night. I must say it lived up to the hype!! Everything was spot on! The vibe was wonderful with intimate decor, perfect for a date night. Our server was attentive and super helpful as we decided drinks and entrees. We ordered a little bit of everything, but the baked goat cheese appetizer, roasted chicken, brussel sprouts and truffle mac and cheese were major hits!! I definitely plan to come back soon and can't wait to try more during the next visit!"
,,,,,"One of my favorite Steakhouses ! Aside from the huge steak we had and some appetizers , my other absolute favorite dish was the smoked Caesar salad . It's definitely a must try!"
,,,,,218 W Kinzie St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,Old Fashioned are always amazing! They have a signature old fashion menu as well. I would save this in one other place are the best steak restaurants in town! In addition the vibe and the service is second to none. My other favorite place in town is steak 48. I love them both Bavette's is my first choice!!
,,,,,Chicco mio next-door is also amazing! Go check them both out you'll be glad you did and you'll never stop talking about it!!
,,,,,"If you are visiting downtown Chicago area, this place is a must for dinner. The restaurant is setup like an old fashion steakhouse, but nothing old fashion about the food. Service was phenomenal! First we tried the oysters which were delicious. Then we indulged in the strip with bone marrow on top. Our sides were the Mac and cheese, elote style corn, and the brussel sprouts (which ended up being my favorite thing to eat on the table). We were too full to order dessert, but if I had room I would of tried the carrot cake. Also, they have a great selection of cocktails, with different styles of the classic old fashion. Would love to grab dinner here again if I am ever back in town."
,,,,,Love this place. Very quaint and romantic vibe inside. The food is delicious. Seafood platter and steak can't be beat. Great cocktails too! The big sundae was fun for a birthday dinner too
,,,,,Went to Alinea the evening prior and actually preferred this meal at a third of the price.  The bartender on the top floor was a bit rude and cold though.  We were scared to ask questions because she was so short with us.  We had dinner downstairs and the ambiance was unreal--my husband was shazaming every tune and our server was incredible.  He didn't miss a beat.  Food was so flavorful.  Michilin stars are a joke--merit should be given to restaurants most revisited.  Our friend who dined with us had been to Bavette's countless times.  And we'll be back when we're back in Chicago.  Alinea..not so much.
,,,,,"Came here for a special occasion. I really loved the service and food. Including food split with the table - I had the mac n cheese, salmon, shrimp, & dessert. It was all really good! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"Simply the best.   If you are in the mood for a fabulous dinner this is the place.  The steaks are the best in Chicago.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection.  A nice char on the outer crust leads to a medium rare center that melts in your mouth.   The mixtures of salt and seasoning makes the palate dance like Prince on steroids.  The sea food is equally as good.  We had some west coast oysters that were tasty morsels from the sea.  Nice, small mounds of gooey deliciousness that taste of the sea.  I could've eaten a dozen myself.   The salmon was equally as delicious.  Cooked to perfection.  The cocktails are always top notch.  Our servers at the bar were on their game.  Always attentive and friendly.  Can't wait to find a reason to return."
,,,,,The atmosphere was really amazing and you can't help but take it all in once you enter the restaurant. I ordered the filet mignon and the fries with carrot cake for dessert which were all amazing but what topped it off was the wonderful server who brought us the bone marrow appetizer on the house just because she heard us talking about it.
,,,,,"Amazing!!  Celebrated my anniversary here recently and I must say I think this is by far the best food I have ever had in my life! My husband reserved seating in the Parlour and it was nothing short of amazing.  The Parlour is the lower level, intimate seating, lowered lights and nice music. Totally contrast to the upper level. Everything from start to finish was just wonderful.  Our waiter was very attentive and offered great suggestions. We had so much food and nothing fell short. Definitely a very special place for a special occasion."
,,,,,"When the good Lord calls me from this earth, I hope He sends to me to heaven. If He doesn't, I want this to be the place I eat last."
,,,,,Bavette's! Absolutely amazing. If you're looking for amazing food and delicious drinks this is the place. The steak was seared perfectly and the sides are spectacular and shareable up to 3-4 people. My only regret was being too full for dessert.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,One of the best steaks I've ever had. Better than Gibsons which I thought was the best in Chicago at one point.
,,,,,I had the porterhouse (NY strip + filet) and all parts were amazing.
,,,,,The ambiance is really different and reminds me of a mob movie.  Great for spot for a date night. The food however took a while to come out and we had to send our steak back because it was brought out well done when we asked for medium rare. Overall i would say the steak was mediocre at best.  Other than that everything else was pretty good. Will definitely check out again.
,,,,,"Chicago'a best steakhouse!! We came here on NYE and it was crowded, but the service was excellent. We started with some west coast oysters. They were SO fresh and tasty. Followed with crab cakes. I ordered the filet and it was the most tender, perfectly cooked steak I have ever had. The asparagus and mashed potatoes were excellent. We finished the night with espresso martinis and the strawberry vacherin. I couldn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ordered. I also must add the ambiance is unmatched. It gives off old school speak easy vibes and is super intimate for a date night."
,,,,,"This place is between and 4 and 5. I so love steak and they do it well. The dry aged bone in rib-eye is the way to go. I considered just the Chicago Cut ribeye but my sister emphasized I should go bone in. Ok, twist my arm. It was so tender, flavorful and perfectly coooked (please don't order it well done). Yes, I couldn't finish it but I enjoyed it for the next two days. So we started with cocktails, solid but nothing spectacular. The oysters were excellent fresh and tasted of the sea. We also shared the crab and avocado salad, you have to get this. I could eat it everyday, it had a perfectly dressed Bibb lettuce and half an avocado with a crab salad. Doesn't sound mind blowing but it was. I tried my husbands steak frites, tasted ok but not as good as mine. My sister got the fried chicken (insert sigh). This was after she told me you don't go to the steak house and order fish. It looks dry and overly cooked. The sides mushrooms were good. But their creamed spinach was overly salty and sweet. So a couple of misses. Next time I go, I'd order the dry aged ribeye and that avocado crab salad."
,,,,,"Ambiance is dark and romantic. The waiters wear suits. Only slight miss was our wine came out after our steaks, not a big deal. Other than that, the service was flawless. You can also get your wine bottle that wasn't finished sealed and take it home!"
,,,,,"The vibe is cozy and romantic. My husband and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and background music. We ordered the wedge salad, crab & avocado salad, dry aged ribeye and pomme frites (fries) Every bite was absolutely delicious!!! The drinks were on point. The service was top notch. We will definitely be back! It was a treat for a romantic date night."
,,,,,It's hard to know where to even start with this review. I have been a long time fan of Gibson steakhouse in Chicago. And this most recent trip on the recommendation of a friend I decided to try Bavette's. 
,,,,,"I called to make a reservation and there were none available, but the helpful gentleman that answered the phone suggested that I walk in at around 9 PM and that he would likely be able to seat me. I got there just after nine and was seated at the bar in the parlor bar area (downstairs). The first thing that came to mind was old school speakeasy. "
,,,,,"It was dark and cozy - super cool ambiance. Blu and Exile were playing overhead. The bartender who waited on me was great. She was tatted up and dressed just right for the setting. She made me a couple of great old fashions, I ordered a crabcake which was all crab, no filler. I couldn't even figure out how it was held together. I had a bone in filet mignon and an order of mac & cheese. All told, including tip, it was about $210.00. Worth every penny!"
,,,,,"If you find yourself in Chicago and want to have a great steak and want to chill in a great ambiance, give Bavette's a try. You won't regret it."
,,,,,"I'll admit I'm not real big into beef, but we're in Chicago and I always like to have a nice steak dinner + my bestie loves steak so I booked us in at Bavette's since we'd never been before and I'm on a Chicago steakhouse rotation every time I visit."
,,,,,"Here's what I think - if someone offered to take me to my choice of ANY steakhouse in Chicago, I'm picking Bavette's. Is that a ringing endorsement? I think it is. Sure, I love a bunch of other top tier steakhouses around, but there's something about Bavette's that keeps me wanting to come back again and again. And when I had the above cited choice for a major milestone birthday, I did exactly as I said. And wow, it was spectacular yet again. "
,,,,,"Yes, it has a dark, speakeasy kind of atmosphere. But the experience is first rate. Service during the pandemic was attentive while maintaining distance. Not the least bit overbearing or invasive. In a word it was perfect. Cocktails were spot on. Food? Oh yes, the food. Wow. Everything I've ever ordered here has blown me away. Must be why I like it. So if you're looking for a first rate experience or trying to impress someone, you might move Bavette's up to the top of your list. And if you're looking to impress me? Invite me along! I'm always ready."
,,,,,"Absolutely delicious food. Probably my favorite steakhouse in the city from a steak standpoint. I ordered the petite filet, which had a delicious sear on it, paired with a roasted tomato and creamy sauce. Most places charge anywhere from $5-10 for a sauce to accompany your steak -- I appreciate the fact they included this with their petite cut. The bacon and tomato salad was a delicious start to our meal (the half-portion is best for 2 people). The sides were great also (their mac & cheese beat out Maple & Ash and RPM Steak). I definitely plan on coming back."
,,,,,"Carol Ann in the basement bar is a VIBE!!!  The smells, the drinks with THE ROOTS just breezing thru the speakers!  Oh what a nite!   Thx Carol Ann. The Bees Kness really was the bees knees.  Xxoo. Love you mean it! XO"

,,,,,Omg ! Amazing ! 
,,,,,"I read the reviews and got the aged rib eye, and split it between three people, can easily feed 2-3 people! "
,,,,,The roasted chicken was amazing ! 
,,,,,Bone marrow - had 6 huge bones and you can scoop the marrow out and eat it with the bread ! 
,,,,, The corn was by far my favorite side 
,,,,,Mash potatoes are a close second and suited the steak well ! 
,,,,,And for dessert got the carrot cake ! Truly out of this world ! Cant wait to go back !!
,,,,,"THE GREATEST RESTAURANT IN HISTORY. Everything you order here will be the best version of that meal you've ever had. The atmosphere is unbelievably warm and sultry cold, the music is excellent, and the staff is much better."
,,,,,"As always, the truffle mac, dry-aged rib, and filet mignon were outstanding!! The very best!"
,,,,,"My wife and I had dinner here. We're happy to tell you that we had a great time and had a good time. Everything was fantastic! All of the staff members were courteous and knowledgeable, which added to the overall enjoyment of the experience. The food was prepared flawlessly, and the wine selection was excellent! We will undoubtedly return!"
,,,,,"Bavette's is a must go to especially if you're in the mood for bone marrow. I kid you not. Pics speak volumes. Best I've ever had. Fried chicken, Caesar salad, Elote are also delish. Will be returning soon. My 3rd time in 6 months lol. Service and ambiance is also wonderful. Portion sizes are solid!!"
,,,,,"We loved this place. It is such a vibe! It's like a speakeasy, good music, and really great service! The food is amazing. They give you house made sourdough...omg I love bread more then anything and it might have been the best bread I have ever had. We started with the goat cheese which honestly We love goat cheese but it was heavy and would have been a great appetizer if it was the only thing we were eating, but we were preparing for a lot of food. We had filets (which they give you seasoned salt which is so good!!) and sides. The broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and truffle Mac. It was all so good. For two people we ordered way to many sides. It was all very good. The vide really is just so amazing here. We are so glad we came, it was an amazing start to our vacation."
,,,,,OMG BAVETTE'S!! No wonder you have to book a reservation 90 days in advance to dine here. I see why! It is phenomenal.  I looooove a good steak house with great sides! My husband mentioned that he has heard nothing but good things about this place so I decided to take him here on his birthday!
,,,,,"Walked in to a very dimly lit dining area, but not super loud or crowded but booths were 80%full. I like the nice cozy booth seating & the fact we were able to conversate comfortably. We started with drinks & they were perfect.  Our bread was so delicious, served warmed with butter we asked for another basket. Our appetizer were the BEST. The shrimp scampi were top notch & off the chain! My husband and I made the mistake of dragging the warm bread into the garlic butter drippings of the shrimp & we both made eye contact with each other & yelled ""DAMN!!"" We immediately asked for a 2nd order! I just knew after the appetizer, the most amazing wedge salad ever & French 75 drink, my entree would be AMAZING. I started dancing in the booth in excitement. "
,,,,,"My husband ordered a filet mignon & I had the ribeye! It was cooked perfectly medium as requested & had awesome marbling. I topped it with the MatriD butter topping & that just sent it over the top! The steak melted in my mouth. My husband ceased hid conversation with me because he was so busy eating his filet. Our sides paired well with our steaks. The potatoes & elotes corn were creamy, and seasoned well. "
,,,,,"There was NOTHING we could find wrong at Bavette's. The service was great, our food & beverages were all phenomenal & the ambiance was comfortable. We visit steakhouses frequently for date night & we had to move Bavette's to our #1 spot after dining there! This place is a hit & we definitely will be back!! We absolutely fucking loved it!"
,,,,,My husband and I were visiting Chicago for the first time from Los Angeles and were looking for a classic steakhouse. We found Bavette's Steakhouse and fell in love with the classic and vintage vibe that we love and were lucky enough to snag a reservation!
,,,,,The staff is warm and welcoming from the moment you arrive. You walk in to a glamorous and romantic setting. A dimly lit restaurant with intimate seating and chandeliers decorating the ceiling. The music was perfect.
,,,,,They are strict and polite about their mask policy and will clearly state to please wear your mask while interacting with their team. But the servers will stay at a distance while checking in so it never became detrimental to our experience. 
,,,,,Our server was Erica and she was stellar! The entire staff worked as a team and was seamless from beginning to end. We ordered an old fashioned and the lemon martini which were both delicious and well balanced.
,,,,,The food was phenomenal and very generous portions. My husband and I split the small mixed greens and apple salad with their delicious champagne dressing which was perfectly garlicky. The shared the steak fries and the elite. The steak melted in your mouth and the elite had a slight kick which was divine. We can't wait to come back!!
,,,,,This may be my new favorite steak house in Chicago. 
,,,,,Came in for my boyfriends birthday and had reservations downstairs in the Parlor. The check in process was super easy we waited for a few moments and then were taken downstairs. As we walked through the main dining room I think I may have enjoyed eating there a bit more then the parlor but the parlor was still great ( I was just NOT a fan of our table the chair was crazy uncomfortable and made for someone who is 5'2). 
,,,,,It took a bit for our server to come to us and when he finally did we placed our drink order ( I think from the moment we sat down until our drinks came it was about 20 minutes)- under normal circumstances I would not complain BUT we were then reminded that we only had a 90 minute seating and I already felt rushed especially since the initial greeting and cocktail order took 20 minutes. 
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,oysters
,,,,,shrimp cocktail
,,,,,bone marrow 
,,,,,dry rubbed NY strip
,,,,,Mashed potato
,,,,,button mushrooms 
,,,,,chocolate cake
,,,,,"EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! the steak melted in my mouth and I thought it was perfection. All the food was great, not sure that I would change anything about my order."
,,,,,we ordered a round of cocktails but that was not super memorable I wish they were a bit better I dont recall what I had but I would probably not order that again and my BF was not a fan of the old fashioned hes a big bourbon drinker and it just didnt hit the spot. 
,,,,,but over all I would 100% come again- I cant believe I waited so long to check out this restaurant.
,,,,,"I have heard such great things about Bavette's Chicago and was so excited to visit and try it!! The ambiance is so cool, very moody and reminds me of what the mobster days would've been like with the dim lighting and classy decor! Our server was very nice and knowledgeable, we ordered the bone marrow, 2 ordered because we love it and usually restaurants are very frugal with their servings. Not here, there was at least 6 servings on each plate! We had enough to even put on our steaks! Absolutely heavenly!!"
,,,,,The bacon and tomato salad was next and the tomatoes and the bacon were so thick and juicy! They charr the tomatoes and it creates the most delicious flavor combo when paired with the greens and bacon! 
,,,,,"Our table order the filet mignon, the fried chicken, and ribeye! You wouldn't think to order chicken at a steakhouse, but even their chicken was incredible! "
,,,,,"when ordering the steak get the garlic, they are roasted and add an extra pop of flavor to the steak! "
,,,,,"The sides were great: broccoli, truffle Mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were really salty, and the waiter instantly brought us a new order which were perfection! "
,,,,,"It was a fantastic experience, even the wine selection allowed for us to find something everyone was able to enjoy. "
,,,,,"The icing on the cake was their carrot cake!! The perfect ending to a wonderful meal! We were all so full but satisfied! I highly recommend visiting this Steakhouse the next time you are craving a melt in your mouth steak, or even delicious fried chicken because they have it and they do it well!!"
,,,,,Update 1/3/22:
,,,,,"My wife and I have continued to visit Bavette's for our wedding anniversary every NYE. In December 2020, we ordered takeout due to the pandemic, and in 2021 we dined in. Each time our steaks were perfectly cooked, the creamed spinach was excellent as usual, and the pommes frites were amazing. The service is also exceptional and we feel very welcome each time we visit."
,,,,,"My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Bavette's and it was simply incredible. The steak was perfectly cooked, the creamed spinach was delicious, and the pommes frites with garlic aioli were phenomenal. The wine paired well with everything and our waiter brought us dessert for our anniversary. The service was excellent all around. We had a great time and would happily return for any special occasion."
,,,,,Updated (1/31/19) 
,,,,,"We returned again for our 2nd anniversary and everything was perfect once again. We hope to make this an annual tradition. The food, service, and ambiance were simply excellent. We had a wonderful time."

,,,,,218 W Kinzie St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60654"
,,,,,"INCREDIBLE!! This is the best steak I've had so far in Chicago. Not only was the food amazing, but the ambience is too, it has a dark romantic speakeasy feel to it. We chose to go to Bavette's after we got engaged to celebrate and it was so worth it. "
,,,,,I absolutely loved the filet mignon. It was cooked to perfection - a nice savory crust with a tender juicy medium rare center. Wow I was just so amazed. I got the bone marrow to go with it and it was so rich and complemented the steak so well. Every bite was truly melt in your mouth. 
,,,,,I highly recommend getting the truffle Mac n cheese as a side. It's so creamy with the perfect amount of truffly goodness. The mashed potatoes were delicious as well. You can't eat steak without mashed potatoes. 
,,,,,Service was very top notch as well. Our server took great care of us throughout the entire meal. Cannot wait to come back!
,,,,,"Bavette's is a classic Chicago steakhouse! If your looking for high quality steak in an upscale yet tavern feeling restaurant, look no further. I went to Bavette's for my birthday on  a Thursday and could only find a table for 9:30pm! We booked it three weeks in advance, so plan ahead! If you're a small party, they might be able to accommodate you as walk-in or offer seating by the bar."
,,,,,"We ordered the shrimp cocktail, fried chicken, and filet mignon. The steak is easily one of the beat I've had in the city, the rival being a place on Maple Street. We had a glass of the house red and it was ok, but not outstanding. The chicken was good, but not spicy enough, and the shrimp was ok. I would probably rate the shrimp 5 stars if I hadn't had so many cocktails in the city. It's good, but it's not the best and you can tell the shrimp have been frozen. Again, this is ok but I know there are places with better and fresher shrimp. "
,,,,,"Overall, I hands down recommend Bavette's for the steak! There's no reason to order anything else from the menu."
,,,,,My 24th anniversary dinner Choice and it was a fantastic experience . Top notch if your celebrating an special occasion this it ! Our server was Rich D he's phenomenal excellent at his craft of suggestions being patient and anticipating your needs .  For our 1st ciurse we went with the arugula mixed green salad and apple salad which we split and he brought warm sourdough bread with oil and cheese. Next our drinks which was very strong by the way shout out to the bartender he had one Job and he did that ! Drinks were cosmopolitan and cucumber martini hubby choice 
,,,,," Main courses were lamb chop for me and ribeye for hubby only two chop but meaty and so well seasoned I haven't has red meat in a way so this was a treat! My man is the pickiest on the planet and he loved his food yayyy. Rich D  Actually read our  Profile prior to our reservation and knew that we did not want shellfish or pork  so he made sure that that was still the case we didn't want any  prepared near our meal.  All the sides are served allocart so his cart so we had mushrooms ,  sweet potato and the truffle Mac and cheese I was very scared to try the truffle Mac and cheese cause I've had tried truffle dish before and it can be very overpowering but this dish was so decadent and creamy and it's definitely different but delicious The little things really made the difference here to make it a is a personalized and memorable meal . The complimentary champagne and signature carrot cake elevated this restaurant to top tier status for me! I love it "
,,,,,"Side note we dined in the Palor, picture a speakeasy kinda vibe with R&B music and very dark and sexy ass hell"
,,,,,"Best meal I've had all year hands down!! I went o celebrate my 30th birthday and THIS is the ultimate birthday meal! My fiancé ordered the fried chicken which was HUGE, deliciously spiced and came with delicious gravy and mashed potatoes. I ordered the ribeye steak frites and these are 100% the best steak frites I've had ever. We split the button mushrooms and creamed spinach as sides, and nothing against the creamed spinach, but the button mushrooms were the best bites of the night. We ended the night with the ice cream sundae which was ridiculously expensive but probably worth every Penny. Can't wait to come back for every special occasion!"
,,,,,This was my first restaurant dining experience in Chicago. I had reservations for the dining room at 9pm on a Friday. 
,,,,,Bavette's definitely did not disappoint. Both the service and food were excellent. Our service was very attentive and so helpful. 
,,,,,"Our table ordered a dozen raw oysters with a mixture of east and west coast, the crab cakes, the 16 oz dry aged New York strip, the Brussels sprouts, the Mac and cheese, the elote corn, and the mashed potatoes. My favorites were the Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and New York strip. The Brussels were so flavorful. The mashed potatoes came with whole pieces of roasted garlic in it. I loveeeee garlic, so I was really happy about that. The steak was so tender and came out perfectly. "
,,,,,The one item I really didn't enjoy was the elote corn. It kind of tasted like a processed cheese such as velveeta. No worries though because everything else was awesome. 
,,,,,I really enjoyed the pickle backs. Try this out if you don't mind chasing your liquor with pickle juice haha. 
,,,,,Overall I would definitely come back!
,,,,,Food was phenomenal 
,,,,,"I tried the crab stuffed avocado salad, brussel sprouts, mash potatoes, bone marrow, filet mignon cooked to medium with the peppercorn enhancement, and the mixed Berry Vacherin dessert."
,,,,,Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great
,,,,,Definitely going back there the next time I visit Chicago
,,,,,"We had a delicious meal here, the service and ambiance was perfect. We sat in the main dining area and it was darkly lit but a very intimate feel. I think it's fair to say we tried almost all the sides, but the elotes were the surprising standout! We also enjoyed the Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. It was all delicious. Steaks were perfectly cooked as well. And the sourdough bread to start was to die for! 5 stars for sure"
,,,,,"We snagged a late night reservation in the parlor to celebrate a birthday. It was dark and intimate - perfect for a date night. The food was average for a place like this, but I did particularly like the ~~vibes~~"
,,,,,Item reviews
,,,,,"* Some cocktails and the house wine: Not very memorable, but not bad"
,,,,,"* Complimentary bread: I'm not a huge fan of sourdough, but I appreciate that this was was really fluffy. Sourdough fans would like."
,,,,,* Mixed greens and apple salad: Nice composition. I wish there had been more candied pecans
,,,,,"* 20 oz ribeye: Average steak, but somewhat elevated by the sauce and pepper crust. I kind of regret not going for the dry aged"
,,,,,"* Elote style corn: Creamy, average"
,,,,,"* Mixed berry vacherin: Surprisingly good, I liked the contrast of the meringue with the cream"
,,,,,* Complimentary birthday ice cream: excellent vanilla ice cream
,,,,,"I can understand why Bavette's has been voted one of the top steakhouses in Chicago. Everything from the food and drinks, to the service and ambiance - it's just all done SO well."
,,,,,Let me say that I am not a big meat person to begin with but I was absolutely blown away by their filet mignon. It was one of the most flavorful and tenderest piece of meat I've ever had. The baked goat cheese + bread was also a winner for our table. Definitely a great appetizer to share and perfect way to start off the meal. Highly recommend getting the truffle mac & cheese as a side too. It's ooey and gooey in all the right ways. Believe me when I say that I licked the platter clean.
,,,,,"Overall, exceptional meal with no complaints. Perfect spot for a special occasion or date night."
,,,,,88/100. I AM A FOOD SNOB AND LOVE THIS PLACE.
,,,,,I have been to Bavette's at least a dozen times and it is consistently satisfying. It is without a doubt the best steakhouse in the city.
,,,,,"Hogsalt knows how to run a restaurant. I would happily let them overhaul the world with their aesthetic skills. Between Ciccio Mio, Green St. Smoked Meats, and Bavette's, there is a clear common thread in the ambiance that I cannot get enough of."
,,,,,The service is attentive and professional.
,,,,,Highlights:
,,,,,Crabcakes: 90/100
,,,,,Mac: 87/100
,,,,,Ribeye w/ fixings: 93/100
,,,,,Thick cut bacon: 91/100
,,,,,Sourdough: 86/100

,,,,,"Made a last minute reservation and was able to get the 3:30 slot. Was a bit early so I was skeptical of grabbing a dinner meal at that time, however, the second you walk into the restaurant, the dim lighting transforms the ambience and you feel like it's the late evening. With the lighting, this place feels very intimate and special."
,,,,,Having put on my reservation I was celebrating a graduation the hostess and the waiters congratulated me and my partner throughout the night and were very attentive. 
,,,,,"Foodwise, the steaks were delicious. We ordered the steaks and frites and the filet mignon. Both cooked perfectly at medium rare. The frites were so delicious, if you don't order the meal, would recommend getting them as a side. We also ordered the mushrooms which were good though a bit over seasoned. We had the chocolate pie as dessert, and they were so sweet they added a surprise candle. "
,,,,,"Overall a wonderful experience, and would like to go back to have steak again."
,,,,,Dry aged rib eye (4*) couldn't really taste the dry aged part but the charred crust was delicious and it was cooked well with a fair amount of fat. Plenty of garlic in the add on. 
,,,,,Sides were fantastic. 5* on both the garlic mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. 
,,,,,"Mixed greens salad was alright, I would stick to the sides next time. "
,,,,,"Chocolate cream pie 4*: great crust, I wished the cream on top had more vanilla flavor and the chocolate wasn't too rich"
,,,,,The complimentary sourdough bread is heavenly! Perfectly soft and fluffy with a rich sourdough flavor.
,,,,,Bavette's take a different approach to the traditional steakhouse and has French flair. The restaurant is dimly lit and extremely romantic. So it's perfect for date night  
,,,,,"For cocktails we tried the Rosa, French 75, and an Espresso Martini. All DELICIOUS! For an appetizer, we enjoyed fresh East Coast Oysters. Moving to dinner, we indulged in a Porterhouse (not on the menu but a special for the evening), alongside Brussel Sprouts and Mashed Potatoes. And no perfect birthday dinner would be complete without dessert! So we went with the Carrot Cake (so good ). "
,,,,,I would definitely recommend going to Bavette's on your next date night! Be sure to book well in advance (at minimum a month) as reservations can be a challenge to secure.
,,,,,"I'll admit I'm not real big into beef, but we're in Chicago and I always like to have a nice steak dinner + my bestie loves steak so I booked us in at Bavette's since we'd never been before and I'm on a Chicago steakhouse rotation every time I visit."
,,,,,"They were so kind to accommodate our late arrival, which I greatly appreciate. We were running a little behind after the marathon and changing hotels, and let's face it - we walked here from our hotel which was a little under a mile away and I was probably walking a bit slower than usual after just running around the city all morning."
,,,,,I wasn't super hungry since I'd had a plethora of snacks and drinks on the course. I really just wanted coffee. I opted for a French press over a cocktail.
,,,,,"I ordered the petit duchess cut of filet mignon which is 6oz, about 3oz too many for me. I think I tend to cap myself at around 3oz since I can't stomach too much red meat - so I shared about half with my friend."
,,,,,He ordered the rib eye and we shared the charred broccoli and truffle mac and cheese.
,,,,,"Our meals were soooo tasty! I was obsessed with the broccoli, I think I was craving veggies so bad."
,,,,,"Service was outstanding, the place was gorgeous and we had a lovely meal."
,,,,,We were so full we couldn't do dessert here but we did order the carrot cake to go and later shared it at our hotel. Delish!
,,,,,"I'll also note, since the sides were so scrumptious you can totally get away with bringing your vegetarian guests here."
,,,,,I'd recommend Bavette's if you are looking for a nice steakhouse option in this area.
,,,,,"Celebrated an anniversary with my fiancé here. Our reservation was at 3:30pm, & since it was still so bright out, it was almost weird to walk into this restaurant because it was so dimly lit. The vibes were very romantic though, perfect for the occasion."
,,,,,"We ordered the Chicago Cut Classic Ribeye and the Lamb Chops, both ordered at 'medium-rare-plus' as suggested by some other reviewers, for them to be cooked a little more than medium-rare but not quite medium. They were cooked perfectly. However, my fiancé thought his steak was choice beef instead of prime because it was rather lean. "
,,,,,We also ordered the Crab Cake which was packed with crab & was super delicious; the Buttery Mashed Potatoes & Creamed Spinach for the sides; & Roasted Bone-Marrow enhancement. Everything was heavenly however a tad bit too salty. The complimentary bread paired well with the drippings from the Bone-Marrow. 
,,,,,"To finish off, we ordered Lemon Meringue Pie... & man, was it YUMMY! We were given complimentary champagne to celebrate the occasion but I'm not really a fan of bubbly drinks. I wish the dessert was comped instead. "
,,,,,"I would go back, not for the steak but to try the other entrees like the shrimp scampi and spiced chicken. And definitely to have more pie!"
,,,,,Decided to treat myself to dinner here Wed night.  The bar on the first floor was busy so I went downstairs to their parlor and sat at the bar there.  Much quieter and easier to get a seat at the bar.
,,,,,"I love the scene there.  Dimly lit, low and soft music and the decor consists of comfortable seating for anyone dining or grabbing a drink."
,,,,,"I ordered the small wedge salad along with the spicy fried chicken.  The wedge salad was sooo delish.  If I'd known the bacon was good as it was, I would have asked for an additional one.  They provide a bottle of hot sauce with the fried chicken so you can put as much as you want on it.  No complaints at all on this dish. "
,,,,,"Overall, would love to come back on a special date night or just to have drinks.  Great place!"
,,,,,"The King of Hogsalt Hospitality restaurant group. This place is phenomenal. Atmosphere 10/10. The cocktails, the appetizers, the entree's. WOW. The penicillin is my favorite cocktail. The steak tartare is rich, bold, and delicious. Get the ribeye + frites. Best ribeye in Chicago by far. Make a reservation and secure a table. Otherwise, you will need to be snag a seat at the first come first served bar."
,,,,,"Absolutely phenomenal. From the wait staff to the food, Bavette's is one of a kind! We came late on a Tuesday night and were fortunate enough to get a table outside right away.  we ordered the beef tartare as an appetizer along with the crabcakes and the bread. All of them were incredible five orfive. The sourdough bread was definitely one of the best I've had. For dinner I ordered the steak frite ribeye. I have been to many steak houses in Chicago and this was by far the best ribeye I have had. I still dream about the flavor and the melt in your mouth the texture of the ribeye. Fries were also phenomenal. The waiter informed us that the ambience inside is so unique that it is deserving of a second trip back with the reservation for inside. I can't wait to check it out and will definitely be back whether it is it inside or outside!"
,,,,,10/10 for everything at Bavettes!
,,,,,"I am so happy we decided to change it up from our usual steakhouse places we go. Maple & Ash, Gibsons, Chicago Cut, etc."
,,,,,We have the most incredible meal here last night with phenomenal service from Steven! 
,,,,,We sat downstairs where it's extremely dark and intimate. They play old school hip hop that's super chill.
,,,,,Upstairs is beautiful and brighter with jazz playing. Request this if you're not into dark and moody. 
,,,,,I was on the hunt for the best bread and steak in the city and they definitely KILL it with the bread here!!! The best sourdough bread I've ever had in my entire life!! Served warm with sea salt butter. 
,,,,,We split the 10 ounce filet which came out cooked to a perfect medium temperature. Extremely tender and not overly greasy which some steakhouses over due it with oil/butter.
,,,,,The Brussel sprouts may be our new favorite in the city as well! Their marinated in some type of lemony vinaigrette with a light coating of Parmesan cheese. We inhaled them! Almost wish we would have got 2 servings. 
,,,,,The truffle Mac n cheese is the creamiest Mac n cheese I've ever had! Just wish there were a few more noodles but it was still incredible!
,,,,,"If you're unsure about Bavettes don't be, just make a reservation and go!!! "
,,,,,Thank you for the amazing service Steven and the bread to go!!
,,,,,"I would dine here again just to enjoy the truffle-infused macaroni and cheese, the creamed spinach, and the roasted marrow."
,,,,,My husband ordered Bavette's Spiced Fried Chicken.  It came with mashed potatoes topped with sweet pea and onion gravy. (He raved about it all the way back to our hotel.)
,,,,,"Lovely ambience in the dining room, plus an extremely well trained, highly attentive staff"
,,,,,"Amazing. I wish I could give more than just 5 stars. I know Chicago has tons of great restaurants but if you are in the area you need to give this one a go. Obviously make reservations, don't think you will get in without one. When we walked in we were greeted right away and whisked off to our table. I note that because how many times have you had reservations and still had to wait? I hate that. Anyway, once sat our server Kipp came over right away with complementary drinks! Wow! Let me tell you why, they had to change our reservation time from 9 to 7:30 (which wasn't a problem) but apprently someone let Kipp know and he thanked us for being flexible. I mean I could just stop writing there and I would have left 5 stars! "
,,,,,"We ordered the big boy seafood tower, there were four of us there and it had the right amount of portions to accommodate all of us. The thing that set this tower apart from others I've had is how fresh everything tasted, and the variety of food. It has both East coast and west coast oysters, it came with every consistent you could need,  the shrimp was huge and amazing just wow wow wow. Next the main course was just as amazing. The table all ordered steak and they were prepared to our liking. "
,,,,,"The other thing that made this experience so great is the vibe of the patrons, everyone was friendly, the music was perfect for the setting (jazz), the lighting was dim but not too dim, the brick walls, which were so pretty, the ""stuff"" on the walls weren't too much, everything was just on point. "
,,,,,"This experience will come with a price tag, but totally worth it. As a side note, If you aren't from Chicago, they do charge a COVID % fee to your check. I think it's about 5% of your total but don't quote me on that. Im not sure how long places in Chicago will be doing that but just FYI."

,,,,,Brisket is tender and tasty. Mac and cheese is scrumptious but portion size is small.
,,,,,Lack of parking but worth the struggle!
,,,,,"Y'know, everyone has different tastes and ideas as to what constitutes good BBQ.  For me, Smoque is on top of the heap with the best St. Louis ribs I've found in Chicagoland.  Not everyone who has accompanied me to Smoque would agree, though."
,,,,,"Here's my take: Their ribs are very meaty and tender, with a bit of char on the outside.  Slow-cooking melts away most of the fat.  The woody-smoky flavor is just right and does not overwhelm the flavor of the pork.  The meat does not quite fall off the bone, but you don't have to do much gnawing either.  Ribs are served dry, with the sauce on the side.  The ""Memphis"" BBQ sauce is better'n any I've had in Memphis."
,,,,,"Sides?  So far, I have had the fries, baked beans, corn bread, and cole slaw,  All are topnotch.   Staff keeps an eye on the dining area, making sure that needs are met.  If you prefer your ribs non-smoky and drowned in a sweet BBQ sauce, you might be disappointed.  But if you're a fan of truly authentic 'cue, Smoque is 4 U."
,,,,,My husband loved his food but my food was just ok . I've had better bbq at home the taste of the food and the way it look was just ok . I ordered peach cobbler even that was just ok I've seen seen peach cobbler made with peanuts baked on top of it . My husband however loved his briskets other than that I have nothing else to say about this place
,,,,,Great food and great service best brisket it beats anything in Memphis I strongly recommend this place for lunch or dinner it's gets a little crowded during dinner time
,,,,,Best brisket I've ever had
,,,,,"I read about this place and was looking forward to eating here. I was not disappointed. I tried the ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. All were amazing with the brisket being the best I've ever had. The beans and slaw were excellent as well. There's street parking but you may have to go around a few times before finding a spot but it's well worth it. I can't wait to visit Chicago again and go back to this wonderful place."
,,,,,Taste: 9/10
,,,,,Time from getting into the restaurant until we left: 1hr
,,,,,Time spent on line: 15 minutes
,,,,,Time waiting for table: 0
,,,,,Quantity of food: 8/10 (meat there was a lot but we only got a little ramekin of Mac and cheese. Fries we got a hefty order).
,,,,,Price all in of order: $40
,,,,,Dirtiness factor: 10 (my hands were slimy AF after gnawing on ribs for a half hour)
,,,,,Hype: 10/10
,,,,,Cons: baby back ribs carries the smoke flavor a little too much. Regular St. Louis ribs were way tastier and held their pork flavor better
,,,,,Carolina vs Memphis bbq sauce: I liked the Memphis sweet sauce better. My fiancé couldn't stopped eating the vinegar Caroline sauce. Won/win situation 
,,,,,Most recommended food order: sliced brisket... It was softer than a baby's bottom... Couldn't even pick it up with a dang fork!
,,,,,Would I go back: probably not because of the location but if anyone asks for a good bbq place I'd def send them over! 
,,,,,Today I found out I cannot eat a whole rack of ribs. But it's mostly bone right? Wrong. 
,,,,,I was in the Albany park area and happened to yelp this place in the middle of nowhere with 3200+ reviews and still maintained an almost perfect record! Here's another one because this place is awesome.
,,,,,We went at noon on a Sunday. Not a bad wait on line and food came out in an instant. Everything was delicious! Highly recommend if you're in the area. Def go either half rack of St. Louis ribs or sliced brisket! Both are fantastic!
,,,,,"Wouldn't have noticed this place if it wasn't featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It definitely lives up to the hype though - the meat is tender and the sauce is delicious.  The ribs and the brisket are the specialties and they are both pretty amazing.  "
,,,,,"Expect to large portions and not much in the way of vegetables.  At the end of the meal I was very full but I kind of did want a bit more of the cole slaw and mac and cheese.  If you have space at the end, definitely try the bread pudding."
,,,,,"A friend and I stopped by Smoque on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm for a quick bite to eat. He was visiting from Minneapolis and Smoque was his pick after hearing stellar reviews all the way up there. When we arrived most of the tables were taken and there were about 15 people in line in front of us. We gave our name to the host and hoped a table would be available when our food was ready but we knew this place had to be good given how packed it was. The menu had plenty of options from brisket, pork, ribs, many sides, etc. Pretty typical for a BBQ joint. Just staring at the menu made my mouth water..."
,,,,,After about a 10 minute wait we made it to the counter. We decided to order a few things and split them as the menu didn't feature a multiple meat platter. I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs with fries and my friend ordered the brisket sandwich with mac & cheese and coleslaw. Within minutes of ordering I got tapped on the shoulder and the host had our table ready. Perfect! Like a well oiled machine. 
,,,,,"Within 10 minutes or so our meal was ready and it didn't disappoint. The half rack of ribs had 6 ribs that fell clean off the bone, the mark of a perfect rib. The sauce that came with the ribs was a good compliment for meal and I couldn't stop dipping my fries in. And the fries themselves were some of the best fries I've ever had. Delicious potatoey goodness! The brisket sandwich was great too! The meat was smoky and tender and had a perfect char to it on the outside. If I had no self restraint I could have eaten ribs and a brisket sandwich. And finally, the mac & cheese was the perfect way to top this meal. I'm a sucker for cheese and carbs so..."
,,,,,"Overall, Smoque is a bit out of the way but definitely worth the trip. It's arguably one of the best BBQ places I've been to in years and tops the list of places in Chicago. 5 stars for sure!"
,,,,,Amazing service! Efficient and friendly staff. Bar none one of the best BBQs I've had.
,,,,,"We've been meaning to try Smoque for quite a while... sorry to say that we weren't really impressed. Overall the meat lacked smoke flavor and was pretty dry. Our party tried ribs, chicken, pulled pork and brisket. None had much smoke. Brisket was really dry and didn't have much flavor. The ribs were probably the best of the bunch. The sides, on the other hand, were all good - chili and coleslaw were especially good. Sorry to say we won't be back - still searching for good bbq in Chicago...."

,,,,,was pretty good
,,,,,i be back
,,,,,"All week I've been craving BBQ and today I finally satisfied those cravings. Sometimes you have to travel for good food and let me tell you it was totally worth the trip. 40 minutes drive in Chicago traffic to dine (get to go food) at Smoque BBQ. Today I had the pleasure of killing an order of baby back ribs, Texas sausage and the best Brisket in the city with Memphis style bbq sauce (which is needed, food so good that you don't need sauce) I encourage everyone that if you want some really good bbq try Smoque BBQ. If you can't make it to the full service restaurant they have a scaled down version at the Revival Food Hall"
,,,,,"It's true! The best bricket lives here! I fell in love with the brisket, the cornbread, and the St. Louis ribs. Seating is a bit tricky, since you can't be seated until you place your order. There were a couple of parties that were smart (maybe not ethical though) and grabbed seats while one person from their party ordered."
,,,,,"We arrived at 4pm and had no problem parking on the street, maybe because the Cubs fans were busy (GoCubs Go!)."
,,,,,"We went to Smoque on a Saturday night for dinner with KT and BS.  The place was very busy is not really set up to handle their fame.  Their system works well in that a host gets your order number and when a table comes available he seats you and puts your order in.  This works, but in the meantime you really have no place to wait.  You end up standing in awkward places between tables and in what aisles there are.  We did have a fairly long wait, although it may have just seemed that way.  I think I would try another night of the week, but who knows, it may be the same."
,,,,,"To sample, I ordered a chopped brisket sandwich and for Ms T I ordered pulled pork.  I also got a half slab of back ribs and some slaw.  KT and BS had a rack of ribs with mac and cheese and slaw."
,,,,,The ribs were probably 3-1/2 stars.  Pretty good flavor and a nice rub.  They were not intensely smoky although they are very dark.  This is how dark my ribs at home looked when I did not realize how hot my smoker was running.  I have since fixed that problem.  I suspect they are smoking all of their meat too hot because it is all really black but not exceptionally smoky.  The ribs on this occasion also were a little overdone.  You can see a lot of white bone in the photos that you should not see.  I'm sure there is day to day and rack to rack variability but this kept my appraisal short of four stars or better.  Certainly they are worth trying again.
,,,,,"I ordered chopped brisket in self-defense.  Lately when ordering brisket outside of Texas, it has been underdone and you can't eat it on a sandwich without pulling it all off with the first bite.  So chopped was my choice to pre-empt this experience.  I appreciate that they offer this choice.  I suspect they provide the chopped option as a way to use the ends and pieces that don't make nice slices.  That is not a bad thing, you get a lot of outside meat and consequently a lot of smoke and bark flavor.  This was a good sandwich, much larger than I wanted.  Because the bun is too large and bready, I just ate unsauced meat off the bun. "
,,,,,"Ms T had pulled pork on her sandwich.  She prefers to eat her barbecue with sauce.  Simply put, you do not want to eat Smoque's sauce.  Neither the spicy nor the mild were worth bothering with.  So she did not enjoy eating the pork.  She felt it was not very smoky and without sauce, well..... live by the sauce, die by the sauce.  "
,,,,,"KT and BS were given a free sample of both sliced and chopped brisket because the nice guy preparing their order thought they should have some with their rack.  He unfortunately put sauce on the sliced portion, so it was hard for me to really evaluate the sliced brisket for flavor.  It was moist, good bark, not as smoky as it looks.  I would say above average for the Midwest.  Just don't let them sauce anything for you, but that is my policy anyway, regardless of the place and the sauce."
,,,,,"The sausage was OK.  It was almost more like a Polish sausage than what I associate with barbecue.  It had more garlic, was denser in texture and was not smoked a lot.  I can't help but compare it to what I have had in Texas."
,,,,,"Sides were indifferent.  We did not touch the slaw due to the significant dose of red onion.  We would not have ordered it if we had known.  I am the only one who liked the baked, thick style mac and cheese.  I prefer this to the Kraft Velveeta kind.  This was made with actual cheese, so consequently it was a little grainy.  That happens.  I also liked the corn bread.  It was pretty sweet with some sweet corn kernals."
,,,,,"All in all I am having a difficult time rating Smoque.  It is definitely a ""thing"" and overrated by barbecue starved Chicagoans, but that does not make it bad.  Ms T would not return while I would, but hopefully on a night with no significant wait.  I would try ribs again and see if over cooking is systematic.  I would order chopped brisket as a platter.  I don't know what sides I would get.  It breaks my heart to not be able to get onion free slaw.  OK, I made up my mind, the slaw tipped the balance to three stars.  I really would go 3-1/2 if I could."
,,,,,"This place is fire.  If I lived by here I'd probably go once a week if not more.  Everything on the menu is great and the sauces are too.  I love to barbecue myself and strive to get results the way their food turns out.  To make it easy for you on deciding whether or not to go, you best just go.  You won't be mad."
,,,,,Some of the best BBQ I ever had! I love Mac and cheese and this place has the best I ever had. I plan to go a few times throughout the year since it is a great place to sit down (if it's not busy) and enjoy the company you're with. Also can get take out. The menu they have has options for anyone who loves them some BBQ. Bring friends and family!
,,,,,"I've lived in the neighborhood for 4 years, I highly recommend Smoke BBQ! I order takeout from here atleast once a month. Check out their tacos on Tuesday, straight fire!"
,,,,,"Being from Texas, I love meat and I love a goooood barbecue and Smoque BBQ was excellent! "
,,,,,I had the pulled pork sandwich with the side of baked beans and it was Wonderful! 
,,,,,"The richness, smokiness, tenderness and seasoning of the pork was perfect! "
,,,,,I tried the Carolina and Texas sauces on the side and I'm glad I did because I did not really enjoy the Carolina (not a big vinegar fan) but I enjoyed the Texas sauce Very Much! 
,,,,,The sandwich and side were packed tight and I loved unwrapping the paper- it was like opening a delicious present!! 
,,,,,"I will be back to try the other sauces, or just have the meat plain- that seasoning was fantastic!"
,,,,,Wow
,,,,,Probably one of the best BBQs I've had. 
,,,,,Came all the way from the Loop by the L just to experience that well recommended place. 
,,,,,Not disappointed at all. 
,,,,,"Tried thee of their meats - pulled pork, baby back ribs and brisket. Each one better than the other!!"
,,,,,Portions of fries are generous. Mac & Cheese's much less. 
,,,,,Staff is cool and ready to attend you. 
,,,,,Service is quick despite loads of people turning up to eat in or to go. 
,,,,,Will be back.
,,,,,"Wow, Smoque was jumping on the evening we went. The line was almost out the door on our arrival and went out the door shortly after. For this venture we ordered the sliced brisket, texas sausage, rib combo (1/2 baby back, 1/2 St. Louis), mac and cheese, fresh cut fries, cornbread, and the pecan bread pudding."
,,,,,"The rib combo was pretty good with me liking their St. Louis ribs just a tiny bit more than their baby backs. Typically, I'm usually more of a baby back guy. The mac and cheese, fries, and cornbread were okay. The texas sausage was pretty good and had a nice snap to it. The takeaways for me were the sliced brisket and the pecan bread pudding."
,,,,,"The brisket was so soft that it barely stayed intact when lifting it with a fork. There was more than enough flavor where adding barbecue sauce was just to see how well it paired. I am no BBQ pit master or aficionado, but I really did enjoy the brisket a lot. The pecan bread pudding was a sleeper hit for me and my friend. We only ordered one to try and my friend took a small piece of it saying that was all he wanted. Yeah, after eating that small piece he came right back and apologized and said that he's going to have to be taking his half now. I wish I had ordered like six of them."

,,,,,I never give five stars. I could say everyone at the restaurant was super nice. Other restaurant should be like your employees. Everyone had a smile and was very helpful. You deserve five stars and more. I would go back because of the great service. Wow! You guys were amazing. Great team! I wanted to Thank you so much for the excellent experience. Awesome food. Thanks again.
,,,,,Excellent customer service.
,,,,,"Small boutique restaurant the ribs are absolutely delicious, they melt in your mouth. For desert the bread pudding is some of the best in the city."
,,,,,"I don't necessarily consider myself a bbq connoisseur but I have had ribs from numerous restaurants ranging from low to high end locations in multiple states including Texas. Let me just say, this is hands down the best BBQ I've ever had the pleasure of tasting in my life. "
,,,,,"The St Louis ribs were perfect and moist with the meat barely hanging on to the bone. I opted for the brisket over the pulled pork and I couldn't have been happier with my decision. Like the ribs, the brisket was equally as succulent and tender. The meat coupled with the savory Memphis style BBQ sauce was simply perfection on a platter. "
,,,,,"At the time of our visit, they were having a BBQ gumbo special. The gumbo came in a small bowl filled with sausage, rib, chicken, and rice with the house gumbo gravy. The taste was decent and would recommend to anyone looking for something different aside from their usual sides."
,,,,,"Overall, the food was amazing and affordable. The staff was attentive and never missed the chance to clear away finished trays and even provided take-away containers/bags without having to be asked. While Chicago is famous for it's deep dish pizza, I would visit Chicago again just to have another taste of Smoque BBQ!"
,,,,,"Mac and cheese was tiny, pork was dry but the brisket was excellent! The fries were a bit on the burnt side but the sauces were amazing."
,,,,,"Amazing food! The brisket is sent from heaven above, and the coleslaw - UNREAL. The side salad is a nice accompaniment to the meat, and byob is always appreciated. Great service and staff - will be back. Next time I will remember that you can't byob and eat outside. We had to move inside after popping open the wine, but the atmosphere inside was just as nice."
,,,,,"Amazing food! The brisket is sent from heaven above, and the coleslaw - UNREAL. The side salad is a nice accompaniment to the meat, and byob is always appreciated. Great service and staff - will be back soon!"
,,,,,"As a meat lover, I was really looking forward to this place with over 3K reviews and 4.5 stars.. unfortunately I might have been too excited and it just didn't wow me enough."
,,,,,"The layout is simple enough. Order at the cashier, sit down, wait to hear your number, get up and get your food. I've always preferred restaurants this way rather than being waited on. "
,,,,,I was feeling undecided between brisket and ribs so I got the 1/2 slab of baby back ribs and added brisket for just $5.00 more. I also got 2 sides of brisket chili and bbq beans.
,,,,,My boyfriend ordered a brisket sandwich and got mac and cheese. He really liked both. 
,,,,,~I asked the cashier what the difference was between St. Louis style vs. baby back ribs and was told that the St. Louis style was the leaner meat while the baby back would be more fatty. That sold me on choosing the baby back ribs.
,,,,,"I had a $10 off coupon which brought the price down to ~26 for the both of us, which is not bad for BBQ at all."
,,,,,"What I found lacking was just the wow factor..like..it tasted like meat, which was nice and all I'm really looking for I guess. Would I come back? Only if I was going with other people who really wanted to."
,,,,,In Chicago for the day seeking a lunch spot to fill and plump us up to fight the chill.  Hubs and I tend to hit DDD spots while traveling and he LOVES BBQ... So I cross checked the Flavortown recs against 2800 glowing Yelp reviews...and Smoque seemed like a clear choice for lunch. 
,,,,,Just a heads up for newbies like us -- you have to order *then* you get a seat.  They keep it moving in here and it was basically PACKED at 11:15 when we arrived.
,,,,,Here is what we ordered:
,,,,,"Brisket platter (chopped, no bun) with fries and smoked baked beans"
,,,,,"1/2 Chicken Platter with mac & cheese, brisket chili, slaw x2 (stolen from hubs)"
,,,,,"Added a ""taste"" of St. Louis ribs for $6"
,,,,,Total for tons of food + 2 sodas = $37.67 
,,,,,"The star of the show at Smoque had to be the baked beans.  They actually put these beans in the smoker, and you can totally taste it.  However, should I return to a BBQ joint for the baked beans alone?  Hmmmm..."
,,,,,"The mac & cheese was good -- there was just not a whole lot of it.  (Spoken like a true carb addict and mac and cheese lover, I know.)  It is baked with a crumb top -- served in its own disposable foil ramekin.  Tasty.  Especially with a little hot BBQ sauce added.  Yum.  Chicken (white meat) was remarkably not dried out, but not super juicy either -- Hubs said the dark meat was better.  Ribs were not fall-off-the-bone tender, but had a good taste for a dry rub.  Didn't really even need sauce for these."
,,,,,The down sides for me: first off -- the slaw.  It was simple -- just big long chunks of grated green cabbage and grated red onion...but that's it.  Luckily I could navigate around the chunks of onion (so my husband could bear to spend the rest of the day with me) and the dressing they used actually ended up saving the day...otherwise this would have been a total miss in my opinion.  
,,,,,"Secondly, I wanted the brisket chili to be so.much.more. than it was.  The hub's pulled brisket was tasty, so I hoped the chili would be too.  Sad Panda."
,,,,,"Let me say this -- if the hubs was writing this review, it would have been given 10+ stars.  He LOVED this place.  I *liked* it  and can see going back to try some other offerings.  Perhaps the hype and my expectations were too high... or I just regret not getting the Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce.  Either way, we may give it another shot in the future -- but there are just SO many options in Chicago."
,,,,,"The barbecue was wonderful. It is so difficult to get that dark crusty surface with a moist and tasty inside. On the downside, I think they could make it work a little better if they took reservations or even when you are there they could give you a number or a beeper to indicate that your food is ready. Also we had Memphis BBQ sauce and I kind of prefer the Kansas City variety. On the plus side, they let you Bring your own alcohol in --you have to open it yourself per city rules. If I were rating on the food alone, it would definitely be five star but I think they could make the set up for ordering and delivery better."
,,,,,"Excellent service! The host Carlos gave the best recommendations. The sausage was incredible. Next time I'll come with more people so I can taste the whole menu! All the ""tastes"" were too big for just two people."
,,,,,We got lucky and found a table right away. We had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and half a chicken dinner. It was all good. This is the place to go for BBQ in Chicago.

,,,,,Review #3453! whoo! 
,,,,,"Was going to be in the area Sunday evening and so I finally stopped by for the first time. It was 8pm, we found parking right in front (the street across is residential only though), the place was busy but boo and I were next in line, so very little wait...great start. They were closing in an hour at 9, so the fact that the place was still so lively was very impressive. Other reviews make it out to seem that the place is tiny with virtually no seating, but they actually do have a decent amount, especially with the outdoor tables. However, since this place is always at capacity, I can see the criticism."
,,,,,"Service was exceptional. Especially as newbies, we felt very comfortable. Even during our short wait in line, we were assured that a table would be waiting for us after placing our order. During our meal, we were asked if we needed anything. Staff ended up getting a to-go box for us, even though we were right next to them. They even suggested and gave us a separate bag for the sauces and sides in case of spillage. Also, we did not have to wait long at all for our food to be ready."
,,,,,"Between us, we got the full slab of baby back ribs platter (slaw with brisket chili, fries), sliced brisket platter (slaw with cornbread, baked beans), tasting of sausage, and the bread pudding. Some of the reviews say the sides are not good here. I disagree. The baked beans were I think the best I've had. They were very smoky which I enjoyed. Fries were perfect. The brisket chili was tasty. Their slaw was also top notch! Instead of the usual creamy slaws, this was bright and refreshing and made for perfect breaks between all the other heavier fare. The only thing that was a bit subpar was the cornbread. The sausage was perfect. The ribs were yummy, somewhat falling off the bone, but not too much. The brisket was also very solid and paired perfectly with the Carolina vinegar sauce. My boo loved their Memphis - all around sauce. I'm not a sweet tooth, but that bread pudding was amazing. "
,,,,,"You know a BBQ place is good when there aren't additional sauces at the table and that the food is enjoyed simply with what they give you. There are many BBQ places in the city that are certainly tasty but not authentic bbq, in that their lack of smoky meats is compensated with other components - sauce and other flavorings. Here at Smoque, the meat speaks for itself and their simple perfected sauce and seasonings only elevate it. It's also a good sign that their menu is on the limited side."
,,,,,"Smoque definitely has the charm of what BBQ should be and is definitely the best in the city, while I'm sure TX and other popular places have it beat. I'm dying to come back and try their peach cobbler and consume more delicious BBQ. Prices were also much cheaper than other BBQ places I've been to while the portions were appropriate. For all that we got for under $50 after tax and their amazing service, Smoque deserves all the hype. *Definitely choose wisely on when to come though."
,,,,,"Smoque is the real deal. You cannot go wrong. Especially if you order the brisket. Seriously. That brisket is the best. You will not have a better brisket! Pulled pork pretty awesome, too! Fries, slaw, chili, cornbread are all on point. I don't even mess with anything else because those items are so good! Try all the sauce. I like to mix the Carolina and the Memphis together. Lines can be long, especially in good weather. Worth the wait. You aren't here for the atmosphere or the speed, you are here for some damn good food! They do have a small parking lot in back, you may get lucky with a spot. Otherwise, you might need to drive around a little for a spot because it's on a residential street and a main road. But whatever. Just go!"
,,,,,"Other than cold weather, there is one other thing I hate about the Midwest (minus KC)...the lack of good BBQ. The places in Bucktown/Wicker Park are mediocre at best. Then, one day, I was watching the Food Network and boom! Smoque was featured as 1 of the 25 best BBQ joints in the country. Now this review is probably a year overdue, but I feel like now that I have been to Smoque several times, I can provide a more accurate review."
,,,,,"Overall, the meat is DELICIOUS. The ribs have always been delicious, although I will say the tenderness depending on the day can lack consistency. My other favorite meat is the sliced brisket. It's almost impossible to eat with a fork because of how tender it is. I also love that Smoque offers a variety of BBQ sauces that cater to individual preferences for BBQ styles. You can get Carolina, Memphis, or my favorite Spicy sauce."
,,,,,"The loss of a star is for the sides. While Smoque excels in their meat, the sides are average at best. The macaroni and cheese may be cheesy but lacks flavor. The cornbread and chili are nothing to write home about. Beans are just beans."
,,,,,"Now dessert, however, is something that cannot be missed. As someone who is not a fan of bread pudding, this is one of the best I have had. The salted bourbon caramel sauce...O M G. Best way to eat it: heated up! The peach cobbler is also delicious."
,,,,,"Until another amazing BBQ place opens up, this is my joint in Chicago!!"
,,,,,"The best true (read: not covered in sauce, although I like that too) BBQ I've had in Chicago, although still not quite as good as ""pretty good"" BBQ you can get in Texas.  Tip:  Go early on a Sunday; 11-11:30 am is a good time."
,,,,,"A friend and I tried nearly all the meat varieties they have - chopped brisket, sliced brisket, st louis ribs, pulled pork.  Chopped brisket (as close as you could get to burnt ends) and pulled pork were my favorite, and I also liked that they gave you both sweet sauce and vinegary sauce.  We tried many of the sides too: fries (huge portion!), cornbread, mac & cheese, and cole slaw...which is vinegary, not creamy (for those of you who care)."
,,,,,I will be back!
,,,,,20-25 min wait at 6pm on a Saturday night is not bad for this place. They have a good system of seating and ordering. 
,,,,,The food is pretty darn great.
,,,,,-Rib Combo. I can't say if the baby back ribs are necessarily better than the St Louis. They are just 2 versions and both are good. (I prefer baby back)
,,,,,-Pulled pork - no need for additional bbq sauce. it's just great on it's on.
,,,,,-sliced brisket - this was falling apart in a good way :)
,,,,,- I actually like their coleslaw! - cuz it has no mayo...vinegar based. almost inspired me to figure out their recipe. 
,,,,,I like that the bbq sauce containers tells you which sauce to use for which meat. That was useful
,,,,,My sister worked her and tbh I would have never gone in there to eat if it wasn't because she got special discounts! The food is incredibly good and the meat is so fucking tender! Pricey but well worth it!
,,,,,"I just Ubered here from Rosemont... but I'm from Seattle. Second time here! SO WORTH THE RIDE! I fly for a living so have had BBQ in Austin, ST Louis, Kansas City, Charleston... and NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE holds a candle to Smoque in good ole Chicago!!!"
,,,,,"The briskette is outrageously moist n juicy. By far, some of the best I've ever had! They have a to die for dessert... pecan pie bread pudding...unbelievable!!!!"
,,,,,Yum yum it was pretty good ! Couple of sauces to choose from so I got both.. good topping choices overall pretty good
,,,,,"First this place really needs to move into bigger digs. We came at 2 on a saturday, and the place was packed. You have to squeeze by people to sit down, go to the bathroom, pick up the food, pick up the utensils you forgot, get water, really anything.  There was a sign that said max occupancy was 45 people, and there were definitely more people than that."
,,,,,"Now, onto the food!  We got the baby back ribs, and they were generally soft and tasty.  However there were some tougher parts that poked the roof of my mouth.  The portion sizes left something to be desired - you get more meat on the ribs than at Carson's but not much more.  "
,,,,,"We got the chili, French fry, mac and cheese, peach cobbler, and pecan bread pudding on the sides.  They were all OK, but the peach cobbler crust was off the hook!  Give that a try, and the pecan pudding was really good too. Ask them if they can leave the sauce off though that was too sweet for me."
,,,,,"Service was the best part.  Even though it is a fast casual place, everyone was very friendly, polite, and happy to help out.  The owner even stepped in when we wanted to do a second order and put it in for us (so we didn't have to wait in crazy line again).  "
,,,,,"Overall, a solid place.  If they had a bigger space and put more meat on the bones at same price/quality, I would give a higher rating for sure."

,,,,,"I found this place due to all the amazing yelp reviews, but I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. The St. Louis ribs & the brisket was tender, but the sauces were just ""okay"". The sauce really makes or breaks the meal. The sides were small, but the fries were plenty. The peach cobbler was also my favorite part of the meal. If only they include a scoop of vanilla ice cream, that would really hit the spot. The service was amazing though. The server was very attentive. We were very pleased. I also love when parking is free. Just park along the roads nearby."
,,,,,"Smoque has become a fairly frequent stop for me on Chicago trips - it's easy to do since it's right off the blue line, but more importantly it's damn tasty."
,,,,,"Everybody has already waxed poetic about this joint, so I don't have a whole to do other than to add to the chorus about Smoque having some great brisket, pulled pork and some pretty good baby backs as well. Sides, for the most part, hit the spot too. Sadly, they don't serve any beer to wash down your BBQ, but it is BYOB (inside only)."
,,,,,"I have yet to stop by at a time where there hasn't been at least a 30 minute wait, but the staff have things down to a science and are friendly. If you're not planning to dine in call your order in ahead of time and skip the line - seeing people walk in then back out with boxes of BBQ in minutes always makes me jealous while I stand in line like a sucker."
,,,,,"My favorite bbq in the city , besides my own ribs excellent brisket amazing and love there sausages. Line can be out the door during lunch so be prepared to wait a bit . But it's definitely worth the wait! I love there sauces too! Oh and  fries"
,,,,,The long line outside the place tells you only one thing - good food. You just have to be patient enough in order to get it. I went there with three friends and everyone was happy except me. I found that there was too much paprika in the bbq sauce but my friends liked it so I think that I'm one of the few people who didn't find it exceptional.
,,,,,My favorite place for bbq. It is always crowded and The place is very small but they have great service so you won't wait to mo much. But keep in mind that you won't be able to bring your stroller with you. Ordering for take out is also a great option. the brisket is my favorite.
,,,,,"I tries this place in 2016 and I loved it. Never went back because I forgot the bame and its location, one day I was dricing back and saw it. I literally parked the car (parking is not great) and there is usually a line, but its all worth it. The food is delicious, meat of the ribs is super tasty. Corn bread is my favorite there. "
,,,,,After I found this place agian. I been going at leat another 5 times. The people working there are very polite and helpful.
,,,,,I have been here twice and there is a line out the door. I think this is the best BBQ in Chicago. My mouth still waters for the Brisket. The owners are passionate about BBQ and it shows. The only problem is that it's a drive to get their from the burbs. 
,,,,,Best Brisket and Carolina BBQ sauce. My recommendation is that you try it
,,,,,Just got Bbq sat night. As always OUTSTANDING! 
,,,,,Barry was helping out crew handing customers their food. Great job you guys!
,,,,,"Please please please get the fries back on the menu. Barry, don't worry about them being soggy by time you get home"
,,,,,-they usually don't last for the ride home!
,,,,,-and just pop them in the oven and they crisp right up!
,,,,,Thanks again you guys!
,,,,,You rock BBQ!

,,,,,"I had a wonderful experience at Smoque BBQ today! The food is superb! I always judge a barbecue place by its sides. I can only speak to the ones I actually tasted. The mac and cheese is a small delight. Eat it while it's hot and crispy on top and you will be in mac and cheese heaven. The coleslaw is vinaigrette based. It was  crunchy, tart, and has a lovely subtle onion flavor. Quite good. The cornbread... Wow! It is almost as good as my homemade cornbread. It is creamy and dense and has a just the right amount of actual corn kernels in the batter. If you want to kick it up a knotch don't just butter it, add some of the candied jalapeños! Yum! The french fries are made with real potatoes and are crisp and perfectly seasoned. You can't go wrong with the fries. "
,,,,,"Now to the part all of you care about, the meat. The baby back ribs fall off the bone so easily, and yet they are not greasy in any way. The only thing that comes off on your fingers is a little bit of dry rub and the occasional sauce you wound up getting your fingers into by accident. The brisket was so tender and moist I was actually quite happy eating it without any sauce at all. However, I can recommend all of their sauces. Based on what you like, a NC vinegar based sauce, or a smokey and sweet Memphis sauce you will find one you like. They even have a spicy Memphis style; however, I did not find it to be substantially hotter. I was not expecting to find a gem like this in Chicago."
,,,,,"One final, and in my opinion really  important comment, they take food allergies very seriously! My sister who has a very serious case of celiac disease and lactose allergy was able to eat here safely and without a trip to the ER. Al thank you for all the careful treatment. I look forward to visiting the next time I am in town!"
,,,,,Best bbq the brisk is my favorite oh and their coleslaw is yummy!!! Anything you order from here you won't be disappointed everything is delicious

,,,,,"If you are looking for great barbeque this is the place to go. The St. Louis ribs are smoked to perfection and falling off the bone. The brisket is so tender you don't need a knife. The baked beans has nice pieces of brisket in it and seasoned well. The mac and cheese is nice too. The sauces that come with it is Carolina sauce and Memphis sauce, this can be based on what your taste. This was my second time and once again I'm impressed."
,,,,,"Enjoyed our outside patio meal under the tent.  BBQ was excellent including baby back ribs & chopped brisket sandwich, along with cornbread, chili & cole slaw.  What really stood out was the commitment to a safe dining experience.  Ordering process, table seating, food delivery and continuous cleaning of tables/chairs demonstrated great consideration for the health of customers and employees.  Well done!"
,,,,,"Hmmm..I'm disappointed by Midwest 'Que! When there aren't paper towels on the table, you already know that it's just going to be ok. "
,,,,,"When we arrived, there was a huge line out the door & around the block. We decided to wait anyway. Food came pretty quickly. "
,,,,,"Per my usual BBQ order, I went with the ribs. Smoque touts their ribs as a memphis-style dry rub with their St. Louis ribs being ""meatier and smokier than the baby backs."" It was really just okay. At this point, I had only had fall-off-the-bone, delicious ribs in Austin and I felt that even though Smoque's was decent, it wasn't worth the wait."
,,,,,Meh.
,,,,,"I ate out of hunger and although it wasn't bad, Smoque just isn't on the same playing field as southern BBQ that we have in Atlanta.  Would give this place a 3.8"
,,,,,"It's located outside of downtown, so I was expecting more to compensate our drive out here.  It is more organized than most of the BBQ joints in Atlanta where they actually seat you.  Kudos for that!  "
,,,,,"For a party of 4, we ordered a pound of sliced brisket, full rack of the St. Louis rib, cole slaw, mac n' cheese, bbq beans, fries, corn bread, and peach cobblers.  On the exterior the meat looks a bit over-charred but it wasn't burnt at all, which was good.  Ribs were decent but the brisket was just too dry.  Fries were cold and stale, cole slaw had no flavor, but mac n' cheese was pretty decent, as well as the corn bread.  The crusts of the peach cobbler was delicious, but once you pass the crust, it's like eating canned peaches heated up.  All time favorite was the bbq beans!!! It's flavorful, sweet, bbq-y, tangy, and everything you can ask for.  "
,,,,,"So, yes, I engulfed the meal out of hunger, but it was a disappointment."
,,,,,Best BBQ place in the city.
,,,,,The space is small for how popular it is.  You usually wait in a line during peak hours and you'll have to stake out for a spot to sit at.  However it's all worth it when you bite down into your BBQ.
,,,,,"Their BBQ brisket and BBQ chicken are so delicious!  I don't have any idea about the science behind smoking but whatever it is they have it down.  Their chicken, ribs, and brisket are always nice and moist (literally falls off the bone).  All their food has a nice and delicious hickory, woody, smokey taste. "
,,,,,"Their sauces and their sides are just as great.  While I normally think homemade BBQ sauce is vinegary I think Smoque's is not vinegary at all.  My favorite is their hot sauce, I can put that thing on everything.  "
,,,,,"But their sides... wow!  Unfortunately for other BBQ places in the city, when I think of BBQ sides I always compare others' to Smoque's.  The cornbread, the mac and cheese, the cole slaw, the peach cobbler, the fries... it's all so good.  You won't go wrong anyway so try them all.  "
,,,,,"They are BYOB so it makes for a nice evening if you're able to sit outside.  Be prepared to eat and leave though, this is not a sit and hang out type of place."
,,,,,"So hungry and excited to try one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago, my friends and I stopped here for lunch and drinks. It's BYOB so we brought a few bottles of Stella to accompany our ribs. Between 4 people, we shared 2 racks of ribs, a platter of beef brisket, and a platter of pulled pork + sides (mac & cheese, fries, and a salad. Total was $50ish. The food came out pretty fast and we digged in (after a few pictures for social medias)."
,,,,,"The baby back ribs were dry rubbed and I did not enjoy it as much as Pappy's in St. Louis or Phil's in San Diego, CA. But my friend, who is an expert in ribs and he loves dry rubbed, loved the ribs here. The meat is good but the meat didn't fall off as easily and not as tender. You do get to dip into different sauces that are available and each one has a subtle difference."
,,,,,The sides aren't unique and nothing stood out. 
,,,,,"The beef briskets were super tender and just melts in your mouth. I think that was my favorite part of the meal. The pulled pork was seasoned pretty well, but it's nothing amazing. "
,,,,,I guess I failed to see what got all the other 3000 people to think that this place is amazing...
,,,,,Street parking is fairly easy to find and it's free!
,,,,,I got 5 (stars) on it!!
,,,,,"This place is awesome.  It can get crowded, but they do a great job of keeping things orderly with the seating, the line, etc.  Great job on the execution of that."
,,,,,"The meat was delicious.  The brisket, the pulled pork and the ribs were all excellent.  The brisket was the best in my opinion.  I also suggest the fries as a side.  They are tasty and they give you a ton.  I do not recommend the beans.  I just didn't like them.  The mac and cheese was good, but it was small.  The cornbread was also good, but small."
,,,,,"They have byob, I repeat byob.  Just bring in whatever you have and go to town."
,,,,,"I thought the prices were reasonable on all fronts, but when you figure in that you can byob, the value goes up exponentially."
,,,,,"The girl working the cash register was nice and answered all the questions I had both times I went.  Yes, there were two visits to smoque during the trip to Chicago..."
,,,,,Yes that is a 750ml bottle. It went down!
,,,,,What can you say about Smoque that hasn't been said? Simply one of the best barbecue restaurants in the county. The brisket is perfect. The ribs are phenomenal. There isn't one thing you shouldn't try.
,,,,,"Amazing. The rumors are true. I had the baby back ribs with a side of Mac and cheese and coleslaw and, although it was SO MUCH food, I wanted to keep eating. Slow cooked and smoked for hours, this BBQ does not disappoint. Nestled on a quiet corner, Smoque provides a laid back atmosphere with counter ordering and a casual interior. They'll help you find somewhere to sit after you order. It gets packed, so eat then get up for someone else to enjoy this incredible BBQ. Arguably the best in the city. I will recommend this place to anyone who says they're in the mood for BBQ and I will definitely be back."
,,,,,"The famous Smoque BBQ did not let me down. From the moment I walked in the restaurant, I could take in the rich smell of BBQ goodness from the smokers."
,,,,,"A plentiful menu at Smoque, i decided to go small first and get myself a 1/2 brisket sandwich which i thought was delicious. The meat was so tender and paired very well with the Carolina BBQ sauce that was provided."
,,,,,This place gets crowded fast. Best to go before dinner time if you get the chance. There's indoor as well as outdoor seating and the service is as quick as any other establishment. 
,,,,,"An essential spot for great BBQ food in Chicago. Anyone from the city will know of this place and after eating here, it's clear to see why."

,,,,,"During my 5-year stay in Chicago, Smoque has become the clear favorite from some good old fashioned BBQ. There's not much else to say besides just go. The ribs and brisket, moist and succulent, are on par with some of the best BBQ joints I've tried. "
,,,,,"For anyone who hasn't given the place a visit yet, Smoque is a must-try regardless of whether you're a regular joe or a BBQ connoisseur. Sure, the line can get ridiculously long sometimes....but did mention it's BYOB? Bring your appetite and crack open a couple of cold ones with the boys."
,,,,,"I've heard this this place can be a pretty long wait, but I came here on a Thursday night and the line was perfectly fine. There is also plenty of parking in the area, which is handy if you're coming from the north side. "
,,,,,"I came here with my infamous deadly allergy friend, and they were able to accommodate it easily. The manager listed off the menu items that fit the allergies and would be safe to eat. "
,,,,,"I got the brisket platter with chili and fries, which also included slaw. The brisket was smoky and tender, and the sauces that came with it were delicious! I couldn't stop dipping things into them. The fries were crispy and the chili had a nice amount of spice to it. "
,,,,,"Smoque also has an assortment of funky sodas, so I got Leninade to satisfy my Communist cravings. "
,,,,,"I will definitely return to try out the ribs, which I shied away from this time because of price. But now, I'm confident they will be worth it."
,,,,,"Fall off the bone, perfectly charred St. Louis riiiiibs, woooooooo!! I just had the best slab of ribs here at Chicago's own Smoque BBQ. Until now my local hometown buzz and neds reigned supreme...but this rich, juicy, tender, Smokey charred meat marshmallows in my mouth goodness  the brisket here is amazing too, I would recommend the sliced brisket and the St. Louis ribs over the baby back ribs. "
,,,,,"Located 6 miles out the city, even though it was poppin inside, the wait wasn't too horrible. There were 5 of us and we were seated in about 15 mins and got our food in 25 mins on a busy Saturday night at around 8 pm, so I can only imagine what this place looked at around prime time 6-7pm. The staff here is awesome, very courteous and helpful, this is not a sit down restaurant but there was one guy who would go around asking how many in each party and reserving tables when people got up to accommodate each group which I thought was cool. "
,,,,,"The price is not bad, my full rack with 2 sides and cole slaw was $25.99. There brisket chili is and I just added fries with that which were good. The cole slaw was really goood too. I saw a lot of ppl getting the beans and Mac and cheese but the Mac and cheese didn't look worth it as it looked like an ice cream scoop worth of Mac and cheese compared to the amount of fries they gave you, in too much of a fatty and wanted more for what I felt I was paying for. Brisket chili was a generous portion too"
,,,,,"Smoque BBQ is rockin out some Midwest goodness, can't wait to head to Texas and KC one day because I love BBQ (frank underwood tap tap)"
,,,,,"The BRISKET!! Go for the brisket. I like the St. Louis ribs and pulled pork also.., but man o man the brisket is the best I've ever had. "
,,,,,"Cramped seating. The counter is in an "" in the way "" place. But I'd eat here any day of the week."
,,,,,"Ahhh..   ugh...  My heart...  I think I might die while writing this review.  So good....  Too good...  The best bbq in Chicago, bar none.  Everything is great.  The brisket, the ribs, the mac and cheese, the pulled pork, the pecan cake, and of course the corn bread, everything is good enough to endorse."
,,,,,"The line was fast and efficient, the staff was incredibly friendly.  Free refills and food to literally stop your heart.  I feel like I can't come back for at least a month, but now every time I'm in the city on I-90 I'm going to think about stopping here."
,,,,,TL;DR: I beg you to try them.  Just eat here.
,,,,,This place was very good definitely coming here again the macaroni is THE BEST very creamy and cheesy get the large the regular one is too small but it did fill me up for a dinner with brisket
,,,,,"This is my go to place. Whenever I was going for bbq, Smowue is always a level higher from other places. The food is SUPER DELICIOUS, nice waiting staff. Before all this Covid madness, the place was jam packed, any time. The best bbq place in Chicago."
,,,,,"One of my favo place. As I like BBQ it's I appreciate their job. Really friendly staff, great portions of food and very tasty! Highly recommend this place."
,,,,,"I've been to Nashville and I can honestly say that I have never sampled food that was just as good as one of the areas that made it popular. I wish Smoque offered more food combination meals, while also offering additional flavors of sauce. On the other hand, I was able to put my own variety together and still walk away paying a reasonable price."
,,,,,"For my late lunch and early dinner, I got the sliced brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and coleslaw. I also had a craving for ribs, so I got the St. Louis half rack. Thinking these portions wouldn't fill me up, I was only able to finish the sandwich and mac. With your sandwich, you get to sample both of their sauces, a Carolina sauce, and the Memphis. For both the sandwich and ribs, I used the Memphis. I found that the vinegar-based Carolina concoction was a little too overpowering for both meats.  "
,,,,,"I have yet to visit a restaurant that serves a decent mac n cheese. The noodles are always too soft and too girthy for my taste. Smoque rates the same, and like other restaurants, nails the crusty top and an actual perfect pairing of cheeses, boosting that cheesy punch we all look for in this classic American pasta dish. I ended up scooping most of it on top of the brisket, so my sandwich had cheese. It must be a faux pas to ask for cheese on top of your barbecued meat. I certainly did not see it as an option to add cheese to your sandwich on the menu. It really made the sandwich. "
,,,,,"I had the St. Louis half rack for breakfast. It reheated nicely (under a low heat) in my toaster oven. I was surprised that the ends of the ribs were dry, and the center of the rib meat was where you got the best moist and fatty bites of meat. I don't think that my toaster oven is responsible for that. On my next visit, I am going for the leaner baby-back ribs. I'm hoping that the leaner meat will call for a slower heating process, making an evenly moist rack, sides to center."
,,,,,"This is my reference BBQ joint, it's truly the best. The brisket is incredibly tender, and some of the best I've ever had."
,,,,,"I wish that places like this would use a flavorful rub and more smoke, but that's not how these bbq places seem to roll.  I've tried bbq all over Chicago, Kansas City, and places in Michigan, and this is my conclusion. Luckily, I can do that at home!"

,,,,,"1. Look at it, tell me this isn't beautiful!"
,,,,,2.LOOK AT IT AGAIN
,,,,,3. STOP LOOKIN AT AND PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.
,,,,,"This BBQ is out of this world, shall we start with the brisket. It literally melts in your mouth. Every single piece had a delicious strip of fat running along the edge. NEXT the pulled pork! BOYS this is holy. Cover it in the Memphis style sauce  and  you might as well be havin a convo with Jesus. NEXT THE RIBS!!! This... This right here.... If you get nothing else get the St. Louis style ribs. They are not only perfect but they are even higher then heavenly. They are magical. Now please, stop reading this review get your self a Lyft, and munch munch!"
,,,,,"This is the best BBQ in the Chicagoland area! I am born and raised here and this is the real deal!! We first found out about Smoque on Diners Dive-ins and Dives! Thank you DDD! Keep in mind that everyone BBQ is subject to taste!  Is one kind better then another, you decide! I personally like the chopped brisket with the Carolina style sauce! Not a huge fan of the slaw.  I like the ""taste"" size option to try different things! Save room for the Pecan bread pudding! Yum!!  The ribs are dry rubbed and you add the sauce.  They are ok, in my opinion! Enjoy!"
,,,,,Best brisket ever. Nothing else needs to be said. 
,,,,,Brisket!
,,,,,Yes! 
,,,,,Best!!!!
,,,,,Also the sides!!!!!
,,,,,Yum!
,,,,,Smoque is one of the best places for BBQ. I used to not be a big fan of BBQ until I experienced smoque. They have the best Mac and cheese and I recommend this spot to anyone looking for good food! The staff is extremely helpful and they are really nice people making sure you are enjoying your time as well as food.
,,,,,I've been to Smoque a couple times and the only bad thing about it is the fact that there is no parking!  The place is always full despite of that fact which is a testament to the great BBQ.
,,,,,I've tried both the Baby Back Ribs and the St Louis Ribs and there is a clear winner--St Loius Ribs!  I've never been to St Louis but Smoque BBQ makes me think that trip might be worth it!  The service is great and the food is even better!  Highly recommend if you're looking for food that will stick to your ribs!
,,,,,As far as ambiance it is definitely a laid back setting which makes sense as who needs cloth napkins while you're stuffing your face with BBQ.  If Carsons was still open Smoque would give them a run for their money.
,,,,,Brisket was amazing! Nice smoky flavor and well cooked on inside. Im not a fan of coleslaw but I loved this one because it had no mayo
,,,,, Homemade bbq sauce and cornbread that melts in your mouth
,,,,,"Chicago isn't a place particularly known for BBQ but with a record like the one it has on Yelp it was a must try. I have high expectations for BBQ joints. No, I'm not from the South and won't harp on authentic this or non authentic that. I just love meat and BBQ so much that I would go broke going out to eat it all the time. So instead I make the time to make it myself hours at a time in my own smoker. I know how much care and time it takes to do this. It can't be rushed, and mistakes covered with sauce will be wet messy mistakes indeed. "
,,,,,"So yeah, Smoque fits the bill. I ordered the brisket with two sides (Mac and Cheese, and fries) and it came with coleslaw. What's nice is that they allow you to add ""tastes"" of the other meats. Perfect for someone like me who just has to try everything. Texas Sausage? Yes. Some of the ribs? Thank you very much. "
,,,,,"I can confirm that the meat is done right. They provide sauce on the side and serve the meat dry. It allows me to add sauce to my own taste and judge the meat by its own merit. Which, was very good. Right consistency, which is to say fragile and about to break down from its time in the smoker. Perhaps a tad dry but I understand they have to do it ahead for the volume expected of a restaurant. The sauces also were not overly sugary brown concoctions either. Had some variety and some kick if you wanted as well. "
,,,,,"Sides were good, but with a special note on coleslaw that isn't just green mayo mash. Eat up fellow carnivores!"
,,,,,"I don't recommend the patio it all. So many flies and bugs, literally they don't let you eat. Their solution, a candle when bugs were already on the food. The Worst Experience!"
,,,,,Do I even need words?!
,,,,,Smoque is a Chicago staple. It's hard not to come here every week. The food is amazing. My girlfriend and I always get the St Louis Rib platter and it's enough for both of us to waddle away smiling. The sides are a bit small with the exception of the fries. The fries come in a sizable bag and it's more than enough for two people. Service is fast and polite. One of the owners hangs around sometimes but he's cool and just wants everyone to have a good time.

Someday I will.  It's all top shelf bbq!!"
,,,,,Seriously!?!?! 
,,,,,How did this place get 3000+ reviews with 4.5 stars!?
,,,,,First sign that this place wasn't going to be awesome. It didn't have a good smoky smell nor did I see smoke wafting up in the back of the building.
,,,,,Second sign. Lunch time and there was only 3 people in line. And empty tables. ON A FRIDAY.
,,,,,Baby back ribs - I'm not sure if they were serving ribs or charcoal biscuits. The meat was horrendously charred and it was so dry it was like eating firewood. Disgusting. No clue how this made it onto the menu.
,,,,,"St. Louis ribs - finally. A decent item. No smoke ring on the food, no beautiful pink luscious layer of smoky goodness. Just an average rib."
,,,,,Brisket - Definitely not Prime grade brisket ( oh how I miss you Franklin's!). No luscious fat webbing. No pink smoke layer. No excitement. 
,,,,,Sausage - Nothing to write home about. I still have dream's about Franklin's sausage. This was similar to something found in a dog treat.
,,,,,Only awesome items here were the BBQ beans and the mac and cheese. Everything else was a total miss.
,,,,,"Sad part was that I was washing my hands and saw that they were using some industrial sized oven back there ""barbequeing"" Hm... "
,,,,,Avoid. Totally wasted a meal of stomach space here in Chicago. 
,,,,,#sodisappointed
,,,,,"I love BBQ.  Smoked meats are hands down one of my most favorite things on earth. So I finally got here, to Smoque. It should have been a lot sooner!  "
,,,,,"I got in around lunchtime, past peak rush time. I was greeted immediately upon entering. Placed my order and was seated.  The food was ready within a couple of minutes."
,,,,,"I ordered brisket, and forgot to specify sliced or chopped.   They have me chopped and it was excellent. I also got pulled pork, Mac and cheese, cornbread and slaw.  Everything was spot on. I am a big fan of a slaw that has a vinegary note to it. Smoque's slaw is just that.   Damn near perfect.  The pork was on point.  Fabulous mac and the cornbread was decent, although a bit dry. "
,,,,,Two sauces were given. Memphis and Carolina.  I thought they were both really good. I preferred the Carolina one though.   Make sure you get extra sauce.  Two of them wasn't quite enough for my liking. 
,,,,,Friendly people.  Easygoing vibe to the place. Excellent food.  Plus I was actually able to park on the street nearby!   I'll be back.
,,,,,"First time eating here. Wow. Everything is delicious. The ambiance is perfect. The hospitality the best! Shout out to Carlos from bringing to our table some honey as a recommendation. That added an extra sweet flavor to my meal. I added a bit to everything! Went crazy. My bbq beans, cornbread, chopped brisket and St. Louis ribs. Thanks Carlos, and thanks to Smoque BBQ for a delicious dinner! We'll be back when we return to Chicago."
,,,,,Amazing food! The pulled pork is to die for. The brisket is so juicy and pulls apart like butter.  The ribs were really great (a little bit too salty for my taste but that could just be personal preference).  The Mac and cheese is so tasty as well.  My husband and I love this restaurant and when we want good bbq this is where we go!
,,,,,Looking for barbeque done right? Then stop the search you found smoque. Excelent product. Be ready for a wait depending on the day. Today was no wait bit the last time I was there we waited in line for 20 min before we even got in the door. Well worth the wait.
,,,,,Lots of outside seating but the parking can be tricky.
,,,,,Two stars...and I'm bein' generous.
,,,,,"Ambiance - needs work. It's dark and uninviting, like they're trying to look low-rent, but it's the wrong fit for this neighborhood. Carry-out Customers hover way too close to the tables because the dining room and waiting area are way too small. Even the soda fountain was broken. If they're this popular, it's way past time to expand."
,,,,,"Service - friendly, but too slow. It really helps to call in your order ahead of time, otherwise be prepared to wait, especially on weekends."
,,,,,"Food quality - don't get your hopes up. If you like this style of ribs and Barbecue, then these are for you. The ribs are meaty and pretty lean, but firmer than we like. The rub was tasty, although a little spicy, and the Memphis sauce was decent (maybe the Carolina Sauce - ew - is an acquired taste). The brisket was OK, but a bit dry, and it's a good thing they give you plenty of sauce, because it helps. The sides are gross, like they're trying to convince their audience that this is what good sides taste like. Don't waste your time or your money. "
,,,,,"Value - way overpriced. The sit-down restaurant prices with the quick-service atmosphere are a big mismatch. Probably the reason they can get away with it is their location. They aim for, ""you-get-what-you-pay-for,"" but the reality is, ""the masses are asses and dumb enough to buy what we're selling."" Rich people are welcome here."
,,,,,"Started in the 2Ks, they try to look like a 40-year-old crummy little neighborhood dive with great food, but they're not. They're actually a contrived, formulaic, trendy, hipster hype factory that fails to live up to their own overblown press."
,,,,,My family and I have been coming to Smoque for years now and I feel like it's always going to be one of our main spots. The barbecue is incomparable to anywhere else around and cooked to perfection every-time I've ordered. I always order the 1/2 chicken with French fries and their Mac and cheese and could never get tired of it. I even brought some back for a few friends one day and they still ask me about it. M b
,,,,,They consistently have the best BBQ brisket anywhere and the sides will not disappoint.  You order at the counter wait till called and the seating is very informal with nice outside seating when Chicago weather allows.  True quality and value
,,,,,Try it and you'll be back.
,,,,,To keep it short and simple: it's filling but pricey. Did I mention it's worth every penny?
,,,,,1st Timers: Get the Sliced Brisket Sandwich with the Sweet Carolina sauce.

,,,,,"This is easily the worst bbq I've ever had. The chicken was unseasoned and still a little pink in the center, the ""brisket"" unflavorful, the Mac and cheese extremely dry also dry bland. Only thing that was semi decent was the chili. Staff was good, but the food was god awful."
,,,,,"Great spare ribs,  brisket, and sauce. French fries, smokey baked beans, mac & cheese (although small) are great. Cole slaw isn't special, only taste like vinegar. It's BYOB, so bring your favorite. Right on Pulaski just south of the highway."
,,,,,"Smoque is most definitely worth the trip from Schaumburg to the city. We've been frequenting this amazing BBQ joint since we lived in Albany Park a few years back, but that pulled pork and mac n' cheese brings us back time after time. "
,,,,,"This is a no-frills place, y'all. Don't get me wrong. You'll get friendly, efficient service, a clean table and amazing food, but you should also expect to order at a counter, eat close to strangers and fill your own drinks. That's okay though because that's how a BBQ place should be, amirite? "
,,,,,"Parking can be a bit challenging, but you're sure to find something if you circle the block. "
,,,,,"In short, eat here."
,,,,,I ordered the 1/2 pound pulled pork sandwich. For 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks it was $20 and it didn't fill us up at all. It was more like a slider than a sandwich. The sauces were good and bread was fluffy
,,,,,Good decent barbecue had a good decent price. The ribs were really delicious moist and had a lot of sauce
,,,,,Slightly overrated. I mean who sells half a sandwich at the price they do? There are so many other places to choose from. Pricey. Good taste but not worth the price
,,,,,"Smoque catered a work event I recently attended and being originally from Memphis I must say this was some good bbq. We had the full spread from pork, brisket, chicken, chili, Mac and cheese, cornbread and some delicious bread pudding! The pork bbq was what you would expect from a true bbq place with nice seasoned smoked crisp edges with a nice consistency to the pulled pork just the right amount of juiciness. A nice surprise because I haven't found many bbq joints here in Chicago that lived up to Memphis. Even had a Memphis sauce which I thought tasted true to form. I would put Smoque right up there with Green Street Smoked Meats as quality bbq joints here in Chicago!"
,,,,,Get the sliced brisket by the pound. It's a ton of meat and the value is great. Came here on a Sunday afternoon at 3:30pm and luckily there was no line. Grabbed some sliced brisket and a few sides. I had everything on their menu and everything is delicious. Make sure to get the peach cobbler!
,,,,,"Since I came to USA from Japan, I'm a big fun of BBQ Rob.  I like their rib best in Chicago area.  Rib is very tasty with nice smokie smell and taste inside ribs.  And pride is reasonable too.  I wanna go and eat again even my house is 40 mins away."
,,,,,A bit far 
,,,,," center but is it worth the distance? For those who love beef skillet, worth it! So soft, you can chew by tongue. But fkr the pull pork and ribs is ok, nothing special. The staff is super friendly, recommended a choice."

,,,,,Delicious food but in the summer the line can be long! Make sure you have time to come and eat! I love ordering to go b/c they are fantastic about having it ready! With quarantine they placed it right in our trunk!
,,,,,Every time family comes to town we take them here or else we are disowned. 
,,,,,Flavorful. Delicious. Filling. And clean. Love it!
,,,,,"Just moved here from NC, near Lexington NC (the bbq capital of the world) so we know good bbq. This place is fantastic. We will definitely come back. The only thing that it is missing on the menu is collard greens and sweet tea. It'd be a hit, I'm sure."
,,,,,This is my Go-to BBQ spot! Their brisket is juicy and tender and comes with 2 types of bbq sauce on the side.  I LOVE the smokey taste in their baked beans. I've tried ordering baked beans at other bbq restaurants and nothing compares to Smoque's. They do not disappoint!
,,,,,"SOO I was super excited to try this place out and I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. The brisket was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I had a smile on my face the entire time, it was so juicy and delicious...I only wish I had a bigger appetite so I could eat more. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. I actually ended up going to the one that's in the food hall and it was such a cute lunch spot!"
,,,,,"Oh and I also need to mention that the mac and cheese was absolutely amazing....there was LOTS of cheese in that...so just be aware if you're a bit on the sensitive side. I am....but either way, it was SO worth it."
,,,,,Nice neighborhood ribs and brisket joint! The combo meal is more the enough with a choice of two sides.  The brisket is nice and moist and tender - very tasty.   You get two sauces with your brisket and both taste yummy. 
,,,,,If it gets busy it'll be tough to find a seat but folks don't usually sit for long.
,,,,,"Smoque has always been our favorite! Most recently when we ordered carry out, we came home and noticed there was an item missing from our order. We called Smoque and they had someone come deliver it right away. They were incredibly kind."
,,,,,Smoque is always delicious! We only eat BBQ from Smoque.
,,,,,"I've been coming here for 5 years, my favorite BBQ period meat is all ways tender juicy seasoned and smoked to perfection. Just had the chicken for the first and had to write a review best chicken of my life hands down!!"
,,,,,Unreal BBQ. Take the time to enjoy this. Came late in the day and it still felt fresh off the smoker. No dryness
,,,,,I usually get chopped or sliced brisket.  The cole slaw is TOO good so I need a large size... then I still want more.
,,,,,And that pecan bread pudding... I always order it but I'm so full after the meal I eat it for breakfast the next day.
,,,,,Those are the best breakfasts

,,,,,"Always on our list of must-visits when we come to Chicago. The brisket is so flavorful and juicy It doesn't even need the sauce. But the sauces are delicious, too."
,,,,,"There's usually a long line at this place, but we got lucky and the wait time wasn't any longer than 10 minutes to get our food and seated. I know this is a barbecue joint, but my favorite thing on their menu is not their ribs, or their briskets, or the pulled pork, - it's their macaroni and cheese! They are so good, they were my two sides with the order. The ribs were good, just a bit on the dry side for me. Briskets were good also. I didn't like the sauces that came with the ribs, so I used Tabasco sauce instead. "
,,,,,"They are a bit on the pricey side. I had the brisket platter, comes with coleslaw and 2 sides. I also added 1/4 of a slab. Total was $25. "
,,,,,"I'm not much of a ribs person, so I'll be back next year, or when I'm craving mac and cheese."
,,,,,Chicago. Day 1. BBQ.
,,,,,Brisket + Burnt ends - 5/5 - It's no Franklin's but for not Texas BBQ it's definitely one of the best.
,,,,,St. Louis Ribs - 4/5
,,,,,Mac and cheese - 4/5
,,,,,BBQ Beans - 3/5
,,,,,Pecan Bread Pudding - 5/5
,,,,,"Overall, ""as good as it gets."""
,,,,,"One of my favorite BBQ spots in all of Chicago! This is backed up by the fact that Smoque is Guy Fieri approved. I came here on a late Friday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't busy at all, though I wouldn't expect the same for for weekend lunch or dinners. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, BBQ beef brisket, and the gumbo. We definitely could've gone without the gumbo but the sandwich and brisket was prepared just the way I like meat - extremely flavorful and moist. It doesn't seem like a lot of food at first but once you start eating, the meat fills you up really quickly. "
,,,,,"I would absolutely come back to Smoque and look forward to the next time that I do. I think it's a Chicago BBQ essential highly highly recommend this place to not only meat lovers, but people who feel indifferent towards BBQ."
,,,,,"DDD Highlighted restaurant...Barbecue heaven! You cannot go wrong with any of the BBQ choices available. I did a taste of Brisket, Baby Back Ribs, with BBQ beans, coleslaw and fries. Everything had a great flavor, with the perfect blend of spices and hardwood smoke. Amazing bbq sauces! 100% recommend!"
,,,,,Great BBQ. But pricy. Most BBQ is lower quality ribs and cuts that doesn't involve a lot of labor to prepare. Just drop the prices a buck or two to make it more reasonable.
,,,,,"Best barbecue joint near Lakeview! I read many great reviews about this place and the bar was set real damn high, and of course it exceeded all expectations."
,,,,,"I don't know about you but I'm REAL picky when it comes to barbecue places. The sauce has to be amazing, the meat has to be a certain way, and the smells have to be delicious. Smoque to-go was my first visit to this restaurant and walking in to pick up our order quickly exceeded one expectation quickly; smells. "
,,,,,Smells: oh man did it exceed expectation. The restaurant is on the smaller side but that just made everything better. The smells of bbq ribs and bbq pork sandwiches filled the air around us. I was automatically interested after opening the door. 
,,,,,"Other foods that aren't ribs: after bringing the food home (1 St. Louis full slab with coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and beans) we were dying to dig in. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard but the crunchy top killed it. Don't even get me started on the coleslaw, completely reminded me of my UIUC days at Joes Burgers. The slaw was delicious and not overbearing. The beans were extraordinarily tasty (I wish I had more!!!) and now for the main course review. "
,,,,,"Ribs: holy moly these were delicious. When people write reviews saying this was the best bbq place in Chicago for ribs, couldn't agree more! The ribs were well cooked and the meat on them was delicious!!!! There wasn't any fat it was all big juicy meats on the ribs. Incredible, it really was. The sauce BLEW MY MIND!!! they gave us two cups of the sauce and we finished both, craving more. The sauce was so good I could honestly eat it plain which is totally nasty but feels totally right. "
,,,,,"Overall, this place exceeded expectations! Keep on doing the great rib work!"
,,,,,This place in fact does have allllllllll the SMOQUE! 
,,,,,"The brisket is absolutely amazing, I recommend buying the meat by the pound because I promise you after you eat your ""sandwich"" you will wish you had more!  "
,,,,,A little over $20 by the pound but worth every penny! 
,,,,,Also have an amazing selection of a sauces so you will definitely be able to find one everyone in the group for diner likes!
,,,,,"If you want all the SMOQUE, this is your spot for bbq food in Chicago!"
,,,,,This is my favorite place for ribs on the north side. The food is always consistent. The owner is super cool too!
,,,,,"The meat is always outstanding at a Smoque, as are the fries. As for the other sides, they need some work."

,,,,,Smoque was recommended to us by a friend who is a chef and this has become one of our go-to takeout spots when we have company. All their meats are juicy and flavorful and their take on classic sides are delicious. Make sure to order ahead or go at off-times otherwise you'll be waiting a long time for your food because they get PACKED and they don't have a ton of seating.
,,,,,"Amazing food however always super busy so make sure you call them in advance to make sure they have certain things left.  If you go too late, you will have a very limited choice of items.  Parking is a bit rough as well."
,,,,,Tasty BBQ with awesome sauces. 
,,,,,"Ordered the sliced brisket and pulled pork platter, added sausage and st louis ribs, with side of brisket chili and mac n cheese. Sliced brisket was very lean and a bit dry but everything else was great. Favorite was the pulled pork, which was surprisingly tender. My favorite sauce was the Spicy Memphis. Also really enjoyed the chili. Portion was small."
,,,,,"Outside of ribs cooked on the grill or a smoker, it's the next best thing.  Always my go to and I would always recommend the St. Louis style ribs.  Perfection!!!"
,,,,,"Holy cow bro... THE SLICED BRISKET IN THIS PLACE AND THE RIBS WORTH IT MEN WORTH IT. I guess the only counter part is their bbq sauce but it's the best BBQ Meat you can get in Chicago. Even there caramel pecan bread is freaking amazing for those after sweet cravings. So into the bbq, they only got two sauces over there and one is thick and the other kind of spicy. I prefer thick sauce but I've tried better bbq sauces. But that doesnt mean anything when u trying those smoked flavor ribs. The coleslaw is kind of sour and sweet so good. Potatoe fries are ok and crunchy. Suit yourself with the picture"
,,,,,Best BBQ I've ever had and I've had a lot! You won't be disappointed. Don't forget dessert. It's homemade and delicious.
,,,,,Ordered online then picked up in their pick up lane at the designated time. Fast and easy! Can't wait to have my favorite brisket.
,,,,,"Ordered on line yesterday and did the pickup ourselves.  For those of you who may be concerned about how difficult it might be to pick up, you don't need to be.  They have a long line right on the side of the building, you pull into the line--no hassle. They walk up to your car, you give them your order number and they're back in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with your order. We ordered the brisket, which was exceptional!!  Ordered 1/2 of baby back and St Louis ribs as well, and they were super.  Got enough sauce so we were happy."
,,,,,This bbq is hands down the best in Chicago- meat is so tender and their sides are all delicious. Hard to not over eat here. Runs real well- clean and efficient.
,,,,,GET THE BRISKET. 
,,,,,"It was super tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. "
,,,,,Bbq sauces were so good. One's thick and sweet: Carolina style. The other one's thin and vinegary: Memphis style. 
,,,,,"Ordered with a side of Mac & Cheese, Cornbread, and slaw. Cornbread was good, had bits of corn, but I think some jalapeños would amp it upppp. Mac & cheese was so bomb with a toasted breadcrumb top. Slaw was quite vinegary- not like most slaws I've had but refreshing! "
,,,,,"Asked to switch my mac & cheese for fries and girl calling out orders gave it to me for free. That kind of customer service alone will have me coming back time and time again for sure, and with friends/family. "
,,,,,"Fries were crispy and fresh. So glad she let me keep the Mac & cheese because it was delicious. So cheesy, and warm, like a hug you'd get from your grandma or big auntie."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60641"
,,,,,"The food tasted pretty good but it's not exactly very thoughtful/polite to be serving your customers burnt food.  It gets annoying to have to cut off all the burnt parts off of the meat before consuming.  Inconvenient.  Also, I'm sure a lot of people just eat the burnt parts because they just either don't know that it's bad for your health to ingest it or they know but are too lazy to remove the burnt parts.  That makes the food here somewhat hazardous to the public."
,,,,,I used to like this place I don't know what's going on over there now but I ordered the brisket it was completely dried out so they lost a good customer.
,,,,,"My mom absolutely loves this place! They have the best brisket around. I am also crazy about their corn bread and mac and cheese. Smoque is a must try if you live in Chicago, or if you have a taste for bbq and you are visiting Chicago. Next time, I visit, I would like to try their ribs."
,,,,,"My favorite BBQ place in Chicago. Other than mac n cheese (which is just mediocre), everything else is fantastic. The succulent ribs are smoky and so soft it is so easy to pull the meat apart from the bone. The chilis here are delicious, very rich and tasty. The brisket is also tender and goes well with the chilis. I usually get the coleslaw and cornbread to diversify the flavors a little bit as well. They also have a variety of BBQ sauces of course, from sweet and spicy to tangy and smoky. And no matter how full I am, I always wrap up my Smoque experience with some of their pecan bread pudding. "
,,,,,"Definitely be prepared to wait in line if you are planning to visit during dinner hours, but the line moves fast and food takes roughly 10 to 15 min to come out. Place is small and not good for big parties, but it's got the rustic cozy vibe with simple interior decor. Price is tad expensive compared to other BBQ places... but the quality is congruous with it!"
,,,,,Good food and very great staff. Very close to home. Order ready pretty fast after ordering online
,,,,,*nom nom nom...nom nom nom*
,,,,,"This is so good that I couldn't wait to share my experience with you before even finishing my food!  The quality is great and as the name suggests, lots of Smokey flavors that keep you coming back for more!  Can be a bit pricey, but this is quality over quantity."
,,,,,I thought the food was really good. I had some brisket and ribs. I was a little bummed because online it says they're open. When I got there they were not. And since I got there on public transportation I had to eat the food outside with no table or chair. It's pretty close to rail. I stopped on my way to the airport.
,,,,,"Always a good time at Smoque. I usually go for their pulled pork sandwich (a half sandwich if we're stopping in for lunch) but I recently tried their Texas sausage and it was divine. It looks like they just introduced a spicy version of one of their BBQ sauces, and it went incredibly well with the sausage. I haven't tried their brisket, but my dad is a big fan of it. The coleslaw here is great: light, vinegar-y and a good counterpart to the rich meats and side dishes. I always enjoy their Mac and cheese side, and no meal here is complete without their fantastic pecan bread pudding. "
,,,,,"Their cornbread is good, but nothing to write home about IMO. Same for the peach cobbler. Come for great food at very reasonable prices in a no-fuss place--it's not fancy but you get seated and your food comes out very quickly, I've been told you can BYOB and it's just a fun vibe all around."
,,,,,"Friends nearby dragged me to Hell - I mean Smoque. Can't upgrade my review - tiny portions, enough salt to give nearby cardiologists lots of business, service is OK."
,,,,,"Mediocre at best. Slow service, lack of variety, hard to find parking neraby."
,,,,,It's good.
,,,,,"The sliced brisket is sometimes hit or miss - and by hit I mean the 'best brisket in all of Chicago' and by miss I mean 'just good.' When it hits.. it's almost an unreal combination of smokiness, juiciness, flavor, fat, sizzle, drool... Some days it can get pretty dry. "
,,,,,"Other than that, the sides are always good - fries, mac & cheese, beans.. Didn't like the slaw at first but it's grown on me - the vinegar cuts through the heavy meat and sides for a refreshing break."
,,,,,One thing that is 100% consistent is their service - always friendly and helpful. For the volume they get they manage to keep the lines moving quickly. Outside seating is great as well.

,,,,,OH NO!!! forgot to read my own prior reviews!
,,,,,Smoque is nothing special.
,,,,,I had to give it another try to see if it is better than my favorite Chicago BBQ or not.
,,,,,Fell short of that...really short of that.
,,,,,That's a shame as i always welcome good BBQ shops...need the variety but it just did not make it.
,,,,,YELP!!! what do you do with some reviews? lately i notice a few of my reviews missing....
,,,,,including the one for Smoque...
,,,,,Maybe it is good missing......as i am rating them low.
,,,,,"What the hell is the fuss about Smoque? OK, tender meat soaked in sugar, sauces with more sugar than liquid, fries not done correctly, etc."
,,,,,I give'em this: their musique is darn good.
,,,,,"st. louis slabs are always a hit! super juicy, comes clean off the bone. i haven't really been to many rib places in the city bc i keep coming back here."
,,,,,The best BBQ in the area! The sides are all delicious. Very convenient and fast service! Try the bread pudding!
,,,,,It was ok got the sliced brisket it use to be one if the best the food and service changed not for  the better maybe it's COVID that affected this place not to happy with it
,,,,,"Hungry for barbecue, I came here based on what, 3800 or so Yelp reviews(?)  Four plus stars on average?  Yup, bypassing my other barbecue bookmarks for Smoque.  "
,,,,,"Came by close to 8 pm on a Friday night, long line, most tables full, I'm feeling purty good about my choice.  Then I saw it.  There's a guy cutting his ribs with a knife.  Really.  Uh oh, bad sign.  But all these people?  They can't be wrong.  C'mon, it must just be that guy.  "
,,,,,"Maybe it is that guy, but it was also the ribs.  I found the knife was actually necessary, not a good trait for a BBQ joint. "
,,,,,"Baby backs:  Just fine.  Mostly lean, juicy, a little smoky.  "
,,,,,"St. Louis style ribs;  tough and dry.  You do need a knife, and most of the fat and juice has rendered, leaving a dry, chalky rib.  Sauce can't save the dry ribs."
,,,,,"Corn bread:  flavorful, with some corn nuggets in there."
,,,,,"Mac n cheese:  Good flavor, but grainy sauce.  Bummer."
,,,,,"Cole slaw:  Plain, but bright with vinegar and a touch sweet."
,,,,,Kitchen is a production environment with 6 or 7 people plating orders as they come in.  Feels like fast food.  My sense is that this was a really good BBQ place that got discovered and now has to work real hard to keep up with demand.  
,,,,,"And Smoque, is that French or something?  I guess it's a mashup of smoke and 'que, which works better than Smocue, which would just be silly.  I actually like the name."
,,,,,"Wish I had tried some beef brisket or burnt ends.  If there is a next time, that will be my order."
,,,,,"Delicious! Used smoque bbq for catering for the last two events I have thrown and they do not disappoint! We got the brisket , grilled chicken and cornbread and everyone was very pleased! The bbq sauces are very tasty. "
,,,,,"For catering, they did a great job estimating the amount of food we would need based on guest count and also provided utensils, napkins and prompt delivery service and set up."
,,,,,"I just can't ever go wrong here. I'm a huge critic and always expect consistency. This is the #1 place for that. Hard working cooks, fast service, BEST RIBS EVER! You won't be disappointed. I drive an hour just to get here and enjoy the food. Oooh also Mac and cheese is amazeballs"
,,,,,This is the best bbq restaurant in the city. We used to live close to it and would pick up almost every week. Our favorite items are the sliced brisket platter and Texas sausage. All their sides are delicious. I also love their gumbo. Def pick up a bottle or two of their bbq sauces to keep at home.
,,,,,"If one is a customer who has never smoked meat, this restaurant is a solid 4-stars. If you are someone who has smoked meat, this restaurant is a 3 to 3 1/2 star restaurant; a BBQ smoker aficionado will be able to smoke better food...but, then, it's a pain in the boongie to pack a 300 lb smoker in your checked-in luggage. :)"
,,,,,The restaurant is clean. The service is polite and quick.
,,,,,This is what I had for 2 meals:
,,,,,"Pickled Jalepenos: Scrumptious!! The heat of the jalepenos was nicely balanced by the slight sweetness. Strange, but great flavor combination."
,,,,,"Beans: Decent. Warning: taste these before eating the Brisket Chile. Once you eat the Brisket Chile, you don't want to stop. Yes, the Brisket Chile is to die for. Oh...the beans...yes the beans are good. But, Psssssttttt...the Brisket Chile is better!!"
,,,,,Brisket Chile: You will thank the BBQ Gods for this side dish.
,,,,,"Coleslaw: Refreshing, yummy, delicioso, delizioso, délicieux, köstlich, , Oishī..you get the picture. This is a fantastic vinegary, no-mayo coleslaw. Made of cabbage & radish."
,,,,,"Pulled pork: Delicious and moist. Unlike most BBQ places, they actually serve you pork with the smoke ring. Most BBQ places we've been to (most of them highly-rated in Yelp), do not serve you any meat with the smoke ring. The smoke ring is a sign that the meat has been smoked properly. Also, most BBQ places do not inject their pulled pork. So, if the BBQ restaurant is not smoking the pulled pork for 6-14 hours, do not add additional rub to the pulled pork, and/or do not inject their pulled pork with marinade, you will end up with bland pork. My husband & I have just smoked pork during July 4th...we will eventually become BBQ Smoking ninjas. :)"
,,,,,Cornbread: Basic. *sigh*
,,,,,"Brisket: Boring. It was a bit dry. According to their website, ""The deep, rich smoke flavor is complemented by a 2-layer spice rub."" Sorry, but, there was absolutely no spice rub or smoke flavor in the 1/2 lb to 1 lb of brisket that I had. Luckily, I was able to use the Carolina and Spicy Memphis BBQ sauces to flavor the brisket."
,,,,,Great pulled pork and surprisingly wonderful side dishes. There is something for everyone at this restaurant.
,,,,,I have been coming to this spot since I moved into Old Irving Park and have been coming since! The brisket and pulled pork are so mouthwatering with their Memphis sauce and Corn bread! The ribs are also great and is as close to Nashville soul food as you can get!

,,,,,Exotic smoked bbq delicious on my taste buds love the Smokey flavor of the brisket and ribs
,,,,,I was taken here by a coworker back in college - we made the trek all the way into the city after he saw them on TV. 
,,,,,"The food was really good, and fortunately we didn't have a terrible wait. I wasn't in love with my BBQ sauce, but have seen their episode since and think that perhaps my food experience was more on me than them. "
,,,,,"I found the BBQ sauce to be vinegary, and unlike the sauces I was used to. I believe I got the ribs - and it's entirely possible that I was trying to compare apples and oranges. "
,,,,,"Now that I have a far more advanced palate, I definitely want to go back. I feel as if I cheated myself out of a great experience and I am looking forward to the day I can give it another shot."
,,,,,"The BBQ here tastes great, I would definitely come back for their food. The joint is very casual and you order before grabbing a number and a table. Great environment to have a relaxed and delicious meal with your friends and/or family."
,,,,,"Sliced Brisket: The highlight of my meal! Tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat that goes great with the BBQ sauce. Highly recommend."
,,,,,Peach Cobbler: I love me a good peach cobbler and Smoque has got a well balanced dessert here.
,,,,,Good service and the food is awesome. The portions match the price so it's a overall good place to eat with friends and family.
,,,,,I've been out of luck on a good BBQ spot for a while but Smoque has cured all of life's problems now that I found them.  Destiny?  Perhaps.
,,,,,"I'd heard about the place for years and never gone by and one day... kismet.  It is BYOB, so we brought a six pack of beer.  Everything was perfect; freshly fried crisp fries, succulent pulled pork, burnt edged brisket...  The food came out fast and the staff was very nice."
,,,,,"Like most chefs, I don't really like chicken, as it is almost never prepared right, but I went nuts and ordered a half BBQ chicken; my fingers and toes crossed, praying to the Lord I don't believe in that they would know how to cook it and what did I receive?  A succulent, juicy, crispy skinned miracle!"
,,,,,I have ordered delivery since and the food was just as good and fresh.  This is likely the best spot for barbecue in the city and it is very affordable!  Thanks Smoque!
,,,,,"I'm from St. Louis, and I was quite skeptical about getting BBQ in Chicago, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at Smoque! They have really good BBQ, very good portions, and the prices aren't bad. I got a half slab of STL ribs with mac n cheese, fries, and coleslaw for an early dinner on Saturday. We had about a 30 minute wait in the line to order, and then a 15 minute wait for our food. It was surprising that the food took so long to arrive, but the food was fresh and hot when our names were finally called. My cousin and her friend both ordered the double meat brisket and pulled pork sandwiches, and it was a ton of meat. All of us enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised by how good the coleslaw was. It has really good flavor and is not your typical coleslaw. The watermelon iced tea and sweet tea are also winners!"
,,,,,"My daughter likes this place. The ribs are OK I guess, kind of dry,I didn't like their house bbque sauce it was bitter . I'm used to more juicy ribs. The Mac and cheese was awesome also the bread pudding, size orders are too small for the price. the brisket was delicious. I would not come back way too pricey."
,,,,,"Why is no one talking about the fact they stopped making fries as a side? At first, due to COVID and eliminating dine in (they said fries get soggy) but now, why? I love fries and felt like it was the ultimate side for my sliced brisket. So disappointed."
,,,,,"Excellent Value for your Money, my only problem, since Covid, Smoque quit selling Fries."
,,,,,"I don't understand why, but I guess it's good for my health. Another Perk is, if you sit inside, you can bring your own alcohol."
,,,,,"Out of all of the restaurants I researched before coming to Chicago, Smoque's stood at the top of the list for nearly every website I came across. Needless to say, I don't think it was the BEST BBQ I've ever had in my life, but it was definitely good. The line for this place can go out of the door during peak times so I would suggest getting there a little earlier. The cool thing about this place (and other places in Chicago) is that it's BYOB. Had I known that, I would've gone to the liquor store to grab some drinks beforehand."
,,,,,"I got a rib combo because I couldn't decide if I wanted the St. Louis style ribs or baby back ribs. If you like more meat on your ribs, then you'll opt for the baby back ribs. If you like more fat and something more tender, you'll like the St. Louis style ribs. Personally, I liked the St. Louis styled ribs better. They had much more flavor and were just tastier in general. The baby back ribs were a little on the dry side because it had more meat on the bone but you can just dip the pork in the Memphis style sauce that they provide. For sides, I got an order of the mac n cheese and cornbread. Both came in small portions but I thought it was just the right amount of food. The mac n cheese was average in my opinion. I also love gumbo so I had to try the gumbo special that they had going on. It was pretty good!"
,,,,,"Coming from SoCal, I've had the privilege to try Phil's BBQ. This is what I kept thinking of as I was eating my ribs and I don't think Smoque's surpasses Phil's. However, that doesn't mean that this place isn't worth trying because I do think they serve up some quality ribs here! Not to mention, it's BYOB!"

,,,,,"My husband says this is the best brisket he has ever had. It is dangerous to live so close to this barbecue staple! So I'm a vegetarian and I just wish there was a smoked tofu or maybe entree-sized Mac n cheese option. I tried a salad once and was unimpressed, but hey I didn't expect a lot from a salad at a BBQ joint. I know it's probably sacrilege to complain about veggie food at a BBQ, but we would go there more frequently if they had a couple more options. My meat-eating friends and family cannot get enough of the place though!"
,,,,,This restaurant has figured out what works for them and they do it right!! Their food is amazing and the back lot is converted into outdoor dining. I love how everything is already in to go containers so when I don't finish i pack it up and go. DELICIOUS highly recommended
,,,,,Pro-tip: Possibly the best BBQ the Chicagoland area has to offer without actually traveling to Texas.
,,,,,"I admit I had a really huge lunch before, so I only hade a taste of the smoke brisket and the baked beans. Also got a whiff of the sauce."
,,,,,Sauce tastes semi-sweet/bitter Worcestershire-like. Reminded me of the jewel and crown spot that everyone loves (except me) called LA Barbecue.
,,,,,"Beans tasted more like Kansas Missouri pit beans , rather than Texas style."
,,,,,Brisket had a nice barky moist taste that can and should be consumed without the sauce.
,,,,,They are doing a great job of trying to stay safe during COVID.  Their outdoor seating was under a tent open on both ends with wonderful heaters.  Stopped there for lunch on a 50 degree day and felt very comfortable in all respects.
,,,,,Husband and I both had the brisket sandwiches and the food was excellent as always.
,,,,,"Awesome brisket, pulled pork, chicken, baked beans and chili. Line out the door can get quite long, but it moves pretty fast and is definitely worth the wait. As close to Lockhart, TX that you can get in Chicago. 'Nuff said!"
,,,,,"So delicious!  One of the best BBQ places I've ever been to be honest. Wish the sides were bigger and wish the had pulled bbq chicken. It was nice to be able to sit and eat. All in all, really enjoyed this place."
,,,,,Mac and cheese Arrived hot as did the beans. Nice!
,,,,,"We had the 1/2 and 1/2 sandwiches, both great."
,,,,,I hate fatty meat and brisket is always iffy but this wasnt fatty so yay!
,,,,,Coleslaw wasn't my fav.
,,,,,"We've been getting regular takeout from here since the lockdown and I have to say, these guys do a fantastic job packaging their food to go. Must-haves are: the St. Louis ribs, the vinegar-y coleslaw, the cornbread, and my favorite - the gumbo. (Pro-tip: order by phone and get the quart-sized slaw and gumbo sides -- those are good for several small adult lunches over the course of the week.)"
,,,,,"In the last six years since I first reviewed them I have eaten lots of BBQ from all over the country, my city and different states and Smoque is still my number 2 BBQ place with Pappys in St. Louis the reigning king at the number one spot at this point in time."
,,,,,"I stopped getting brisket because I have been bitten so many with shoe leather crap from lots of places but after having Smoque which is at this point the only place I will order brisket because it's constantly pleasing. I get the sliced, not chopped brisket which is always juicy/tender/melt on your mouth. It has a small amount fat for flavor and a nice bark on a very fresh soft/light bun, sauce on the side because it's not needed but I use it."
,,,,,"The ribs are just like brisket, moist, fall off the bone with a great bark that needs no sauce and I never sauce the ribs. The St. Louis ribs are not as big and meaty as other places but it's quality makes up for that."
,,,,,3800 N Pulaski Rd
,,,,,"From my experience, lots of BBQ places do good ribs and have subpar sides but I actually have liked all the sides from Smoque."
,,,,,"There is a reason that every time I go over, it's controlled chaos and busy no mater what time it is because it's just very good. Since my first review smart phones came out and I can post pictures today of my review. # 2 is not a bad spot for my travels in BBQ land and that's why I keep going back, not as much since I moved from Chicago."
,,,,,I don't get to Smoque because I moved to another city and its a far drive now but I hear they have a bigger spot because of how popular they are.
,,,,,I just wanted to put it out there that Smoque in Chi town and Pappys in St. Louis is the bar for which all BBQ places are judged by me and I put that in my reviews for lesser good BBQ places. Smoke has always satisfied my BBQ craves and no matter what I had it was always very good.
,,,,,The moist and tender brisket is top notch and was ordered more than anything else and the ribs were second. I wish I was not so far away and could easily and conveniently stop over like I used to.
,,,,,Smoque is great BBQ. Hard to get seated. Worth the wait. Good sauce. Brisket is awesome. For me it's got a good smoke favor. Smoque has always been quality BBQ and the standard for which others are judged.
,,,,,I had heard this place has Chicago's best bbq. It's got to be pretty damn good if it caught Guy Fieri's attention. I had to come find out for myself! The BBQ was phenomenal and the sauce was delicious! The folks who run this place know the art of BBQ and just because the doors close at a certain time in the evening doesn't mean these people aren't still hard at work perfecting their craft. Even the cole slaw was delicious! Freaking cole slaw! The most basic side dish ever and this place got me to actually love a cole slaw! They do have their own parking that's available at a certain time in the day and there's lots of street parking in the area. The service was excellent and very attentive! You won't be disappointed checking this place out. Make sure you come with an appetite and enjoy!

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60641"
,,,,,"I am from the south and 10/10 recommend Smoque to all! Their brisket is literally some of the best brisket I've ever had! Did I mention I was born in raised in the south and grew up eating the best of the best bbq?! Whether you dine in or pick up take out, the quality is always there. Staff members are very friendly and accommodating to kids. Best bbq in Chicago!"
,,,,,"One of the few places were you can get a REAL pulled pork sandwich. The ribs were juicy and tender,the bone just came out by looking at it, the bbq beans were full of flavor. The food smelled too good to wait for a picture. Everything was great. You guys are the best!!!"
,,,,,"Still the fav place for ""everything I've had"" when I asked my husband what he likes. "" Brisket, and ribs."" "
,,,,,"I adore the Mac and cheese, so tiny I need two. The beans are amazing. "
,,,,,"The seating is cramped, but once you start eating, who cares? Staff always attentive and pleasant, so they find you a spot if you are perplexed."
,,,,,"4 stars for amazing BBQ, fast and efficient service, good value, and great location (off of I-90 exit) . One less star for lack of good sides and no parking. "
,,,,,"I had their rib combo: half slab of beef ribs and half slab of baby back. Both were amazing! Perfectly smoked and cooked to perfection. The kind that you can eat without BBQ sauce. Yeah that's the good kind! To my dismay, their sides were not pleasing. I had their mac n cheese which was baked and crusted and their cornbread. Both were disappointing. The cornbread was dry and the mac n cheese was bleh. They're a bit frugal with their BBQ sauce so get up there and ask for it. They also serve all orders with their housemade Cole slaw. Too vinegar-y for me. "
,,,,,I will definitely return for their ribs... I'll save a couple of bucks and will skip on their sides!
,,,,,Have a finger lickin time!!!
,,,,,Awesome place to get take out juicy bbq - get the baby back ribs !!! 
,,,,,The place has street parking and easy to access
,,,,,Smoque continues to reign supreme and perhaps even better.
,,,,,"Years ago, I didn't love the slaw at Smoque and it was a disappointment, I think because it wasn't fully marinated the times I had it. Now I love the slaw and will always add a large side of it despite everything coming with a small side. I would buy it by the quart if I could."
,,,,,"My favorites include the brisket sliced, ribs - both kinds, & the Carolina sauce. Honestly, everything is great at Smoque. They've got their operation down and always friendly upon arrival. "
,,,,,"The only criticism I would have is I wish their Mac had a lighter layer of crust/topping. I love the texture of the mac, it's not gloppy, I just wished that the top was slightly thinner in relation to the size of the small side. And I wish the cornbread was ""wetter"" it's more of a corn muffin."
,,,,,It's been over 2 years since I have been back to Smoque (I only remember because I last took out of towners who were in October of 2010) and it was better than I remembered. It's silly that I don't go more often since its roughly 15 mins with the highway being clear. 
,,,,,Anyway...
,,,,,Went in around 245 on a Sunday and there was a line that ran up to the entrance with almost all tables occupied. After placing my takeout order I stood close to where the food was going out and I have to say the efficiency of the restaurant is very good and the way it should be. All too often I observe issues at different places of business that could be fixed so simply!
,,,,,"When my order was called I found a well packed brown paper bag and asked if the sauces and both ""taste"" portions were in, the girl at the counter gave me an assured yes and that was enough for me!"
,,,,,I came home to find everything I ordered!
,,,,,FOOD:
,,,,,"Chicken - I think this may be the best chicken preparation I have ever had, it originally was taken by the Publican, but I think in terms of chicken, Publican has to take a 2, albeit a VERY high 2. The chicken looks EXACTLY like it does on their site, perfectly moist, smoked and they browned exterior carrying a ridiculous amount of flavor. I will not go to Smoque and ever not get it."
,,,,,St. Louis taste - love the taste option here and love the fairly hard to find St. Louis rib which was DELICIOUS.
,,,,,"Brisket - I love brisket, but not sure if I've ever had any that rocks my world, I get it when I get bbq. It was good, wish the top layer of fat was slightly thinner, although it's not thick by any means."
,,,,,"Coleslaw - I wish they would chop it after its shredded, great flavor but think theirs would benefit from a confetti cut."
,,,,,"Mac & Cheese - It's good, very good, but my personal preference is a ""drier"" style with less cream, rue like binding. I get disappointed by most macs, and I am grateful that I can be satiated by a few bites!"
,,,,,"Peach cobbler - OMG - will get it every time, it's divine."
,,,,,"The food is GREAT, I think in terms of all the barbecue spots in the city outside of Chicago Q and Lilie Q since I haven't been, SMOQUE is KING!"
,,,,,"Glad to see this place thriving I wish they had a food truck and other locations, I don't see why they couldn't open up 3-5 other locations throughout and not do well!"
,,,,,So overrated!
,,,,,"In awe of all of the reviews deeming this the best BBQ.  We split a half slab (ok, but not very meaty), sliced brisket (somehow managed to be too dry with the charred fat cap still in tact), and sausage (the best thing we had!). The sides are so so small for the price and completely forgettable. Mac and cheese and cornbread were so dry - I felt bad for my bf who took one sad bite of each before giving up. Sauces on side were nice touch. "
,,,,,"In a city full of great options, this will not be a repeat for us."
,,,,,The food is not worth a 57 MINUTES wait time for take out. You should be honest and upfront about the wait time. I was told 25 minutes when I placed my order.
,,,,,The bbq here is good love the food exceeded my expectations will be coming more if ya know what i mean
,,,,,"Heard a lot of hype about this place. Decided to order the St. Louis ribs, mac n cheese, and corn bread. The dry rub was so good you really didn't need any additional sauce! However, the bbq sauce is still very good. Mac n cheese wasn't the best thing ever but still pretty good. The corn bread first off was also nothing special but I love corn bread so I always get it. I actually really liked the slaw that came with the ribs. This place is a bit pricy but what high quality bbq joint isn't. My bf got the brisket and it was definitely the best brisket I've ever had. If you are a brisket and ribs person, try this place out! It gets pretty busy and you'll definitely have to wait in line but it's worth it!"

,,,,,I don't think I can say too much more about this place - it seems everyone loves it and for a good reason. Here's a quick list
,,,,,Pros
,,,,,- Just amazing food
,,,,,- Great value for authentic BBQ
,,,,,- Great Service
,,,,,- Great Sauces...like really really good sauces
,,,,,"- Sweet pickled jalapenos which I was unsure of, but damn they good"
,,,,,- Non-mayo based cole slaw
,,,,,Cons
,,,,,"- If this was a BYOB place, it would be perfect"
,,,,,"While diamonds have the four C's, this has a similar scale: consistency, cut, quality, clarity vs. other BBQ. Years and years of visits and, unbelievably, this is my first review. Consistency - anytime you visit from the time they open til the last hour of the day, you'll get the same quality and fresh off the smoker cue. Cut - each portion is equal and each cut is even never leading you to think you've been shortchanged. Quality - always premium barbeque, moist, flavorful, delicious. Clarity - Smoque is the standard which I judge other Chicago BBQ by."
,,,,,"Other notes - the sliced brisket is the best thing since sliced bread. Get a fatty slice with bark and it's a perfect bite. Recently, I've been into popping the candied jalapenos like they're m&m's. Their sides ain't no slouch either. have had a one off experience of somewhat dry brisket catering once in all my visits. It stood out so much because it was an anomaly and it was still good."
,,,,,"So I legit live walking distance from here. And I CANNOT believe I did not come here sooner. It took multiple recommendations and hearing about it in a MOVIE to finally get my behind here. My parents and my in-laws were in town for the weekend a couple of months ago so we decided to bring them all here. My parents still talk about this place to this day! My in-laws and husband are from North Carolina, home of amazing and some of the best barbecue, so I know they were wary coming here. I think they still prefer NC bbq (pulled pork with the vinegar sauce) BUT THEIR BRISKET!!! Wow. Their brisket was so soft and tender. Smoky and meaty. And with the sauce... it all melted in your mouth so perfectly. I love fries so that was good of course. And my parents loved their ribs and sausage. Cole slaw was pretty good too. Overall would recommend! Really good bbq in Chicago for sure."
,,,,,Lived up to expectation!! The brisket is truly one of the best I've had!! 
,,,,,"Nice casual dining experience. You order at the front and wait. If you wish to dine, a host will provide a table for you after you order."
,,,,,"If you are into BBQ, Smoque in Chicago is a BBQ experience that you don't want to miss out on. "
,,,,,"Their ribs: Carolina and St. Louis-style both use dry rubs consisting of spices, tomatoes and vinegar in a very balanced fashion. What's particularly special about these ribs is that you can really taste the smokiness of the meat. Unlike other popular styles of BBQ, the meat here do not come off the bone completely, which I learned that the chefs have done intentionally to give the meat more texture. "
,,,,,"Their briskets: Texas-style and by far my personal favorite thing to order here. I prefer the chopped version because of the perfect mix of fat and lean meat. Every brisket should taste like these: moist and tender with good textured, smoky, and well balanced in terms of flavors.  "
,,,,,"All in all, every dish here deserves a try. All the meat can be enjoyed by themselves but you will find their house sauces, from sweet-tangy to peppery-spicy, a pleasant addition. Finally, you won't break a bank eating here. As a matter of fact, they are extremely affordable, which is always a win in my books."
,,,,,Great place with excellent service and great food and reasonably priced! Everything there is great won't go wrong with any selection only thing to add is that they should add pulled chicken to the menu in the future and would be a home run
,,,,,"Excellent quality of food, delicious bbq and sausage and chicken. We used to go here as it's BYOB but now with covid we order from here occasionally. The food has never been a disappointment. Recommend the Texas sausage and the ribs. All of the variations of bbq pork are outstanding."
,,,,,Particularly recommend the Carolina bbq sauce as I like the vinegar base. 
,,,,,"Great local business, highly recommend"
,,,,,"Best BBQ place in chi-town! My husband, who is a bbq connoisseur, loves this place so much.  The ribs and brisket are to die for.  I even had this place cater for my husband's surprise party.  Just come here already!"
,,,,,"We visited my new favorite BBQ place last night.  We tried an amazing array of their BBQ and it is by far some of if not THE BEST BBQ I have ever had.  My favorite is the St. Louis style ribs, the flavor combo of the dry rub and the smoked cooking made me not want to even use any sauce for fear I would cover up the amazing flavor profile from the ribs.  The baby backs are great too and just as good.  The brisket was incredibly smokey delicious and is the MOST TENDER and moist brisket I have ever tasted and as brisket is a favorite of my husband's I have tried a lot.  The pulled pork was flavor packed and tasty as well but the sleeper of the menu was the chicken, it was so thoroughly dry rubbed and smoked that the smokey flavor permeated and tenderized every cell, it was moist and flavor PACKED.  That doesn't even mention the sides like the absolutely AMAZING mac n cheese which is one of my faves so I know my mac n cheese.  The coleslaw which is something I normally would not touch, I tried at the behest of Barry the owner and I was amazed at the fresh palate clearing flavor and texture of it, it reminds me of a German cucumber salad.  I'm told the baked beans are amazing,  I didn't try them but as beans don't agree with my system I decided to take their word on that.  The cornbread is buttery and salty deliciousness with great texture.   And then there was dessert (not that we needed it but hey if you are going to taste it all why not?)  The peach cobbler with the oatmeal crumble topping was tasty without being overly sweet like many peach cobblers.  The surprise to me was the bread pudding which has always creaped me out because it always just looked like soggy bread in other places but there's was so tasty and reminiscent of a baked French toast with the butter, cinnamon and pecans (which I could do without but I'm weird I know) made it fantastic and the nuts gave it a crunch that did indeed complete it.  We were also introduced to Cowboy Candy or candied jalapenos which were pretty excellent too.  Thank you so much to Barry the owner who made our visit one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  I recommend this restaurant whole heartedly.  UNBEATABLE BBQ!  PERIOD!"

,,,,,This place is incredibly good. In fact best brisket I've ever tasted and the ribs the best ever as well!
,,,,,"Naturally with great customer service, best food on the planet, they're very busy very very busy."
,,,,,I suggest calling early and picking up your ribs for the fastest service.
,,,,,Absolutely love this place! The best in the business.
,,,,,"Came here mid-afternoon on a weekend. For dine-in, you order at the counter before being given a table. A no-frills restaurant with simple decorations and furniture. Had a chopped brisket platter with slaw, chili, and baked beans. While tender, the amount of fat in the cuts of brisket was variable with some slices very fatty and others lean. The fatty slices are so delicious! When hot, it practically melts in your mouth, coating all the surfaces with savory deliciousness. The sides were solid. I liked the chili more than the baked beans. Both had a surprising amount of meat but the smokiness of the baked beans was a little too much for me. The slaw was solid with crunchy veggies flavored with a mustard sauce to balance out the more greasy meats."
,,,,,Made my way north to see the hype about this  BBQ venture 
,,,,,"Food- I went with the Brisket, because if the brisket is good mostly everything else is as well. What I appreciated most was lean cuts of meat that are very tender. Combined with a soft bun it reminded me of one of my favorite BBQ places in Georgia.  Last but not least the hand cut fries completed the meal. "
,,,,,You can really tell that attention to detail is a priority for this restaurant. My only improvement would be the BBQ sauce. I liked it but would also like to see more options. Also a location closer to the city lol. 
,,,,,Overall very solid BBQ place that does things the right way and lives up to the hype.
,,,,,"Locations is a bit out of the way, but it's located close to the blue line CTA which made it easy to hop off when we arrived at O'Hare!"
,,,,,"Our first meal in Chicago, and we were ravenous!"
,,,,,"MENU: really simple to understand. Pick your type of meal: sandwich, platter (slaw by default and 2 sides), or a smaller plate. "
,,,,,PRICING: super reasonable for the quality and quantity! 
,,,,,We ordered: 
,,,,,"1. Sliced brisket platter with slaw (free), BBQ beans, macaroni & cheese ($14/95) //"
,,,,,"+1 Love that the brisket had enough meat on it, and not just fatty pieces!"
,,,,,"+1 slaw was good! It's more liked pickled slaw, instead of the mayo kind. "
,,,,,"+1 I really like the beans! Love that it's not too sweat, and the pieces of brisket made it super rich (in a good way)."
,,,,,"+1 mac and cheese could be a bit hotter, but I think the portion size was good!"
,,,,,"2. 1/2 slab of st. louis ribs with slaw (free), brisket chili, fresh cut fries ($15.95) //"
,,,,,"+1 Nom! Ribs were great! Had a good amount of meat, and portion size was awesome too."
,,,,,+1 Brisket chili not bad! It looked kind of like the BBQ beans though...
,,,,,"+1 YAS. Fries on point! Wish it had some cajun seasoning, but portion is HUGE!"
,,,,,Tips/Observations:
,,,,,"1. Their dishes are NOT salty at all, which is fantastic for me since I like to add my own sauces instead."
,,,,,2. Really like the sauce combination that they give you with each rib!
,,,,,"Overall, probably the most satisfying meal I had in Chicago that did not break the wallet. I believe they have a location within a building somewhere near the finance district..."
,,,,,Amazing place to get ribs. The St. Louis style are some of the best ribs I've had. The sides aren't that amazing and it's byob
,,,,,"I am from the South, North Carolina to be exact. Needless to say I grew up around good BBQ. I have also tried BBQ all over the country, from texas to oklahoma, nashville, to st. louis. This place is pretty average, and i don't see all the hype. The meats are pretty average quality, but seem to be smoked pretty well, though the flavor overwhelms you. I'm not a fan of the sauce, which seems to be pretty much the same at all Chicago BBQ places. The sides are nothing to write home about either, i had a tiny portion of mac and cheese, which was pretty bland to me. Cornbread is not great either. I may be a little biased here, but it's not the best place in the world."
,,,,,Always got bad tips or old dry ribs. I went 3 different times of the day on different days. Thinking the first time it was dry and old because they were sitting almost closing time. Then got it in the afternoon when they opens a till bad and them the late afternoon and still got the same stuff dry and old. Not koo. Got a new place for them Ribs
,,,,,My brother in law introduced me to this spot. We ended up having dinner there for 3 hours and had so much stuff on the menu. Highly recommend this spot.
,,,,,"Be ready to wait, but it's worth it. I recommend getting here before noon on the weekends to a sour the lunch rush. Limited seating and the line runs right down the middle of the restaurant. "
,,,,,Plates all come with two sides and coleslaw. The coleslaw is a vinegar base and is really tasty. Brisket is my go to with the house bbq. Must try the Mac n Cheese and I'm a big fan of the French Fries. 
,,,,,There's a lot of love behind this bbq joint and I would definitely visit again. My family has been here several times when visiting Chicago and they all would agree Smoque gets 5 stars.
,,,,,"Ate on their covid patio on a Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly wasn't very busy. Baby Back Ribs were absolutely delicious, tender and with great crust. The two sauces were tasty and the beans were awesome. Mac and cheese was very creamy and good, but a tiny portion. Cornbread was great as well. The only negative to me was the brisket, it had a great smoke ring, but was fairly dry. Overall a great place for bbq"

,,,,,"Love Smoque.  It's small, but efficient.  The brisket is what I typically get here, and it's excellent.  It melts under the fork, and you really could eat it without the bbq sauce it's so tender and juicy."
,,,,,Carlos the floor manager was pleasant and patient to help us with our 6 person group.  
,,,,,"I will definitely be back, and I will highly recommend to just about anyone even vegetarians."
,,,,,"I've since had a couple more delivered meals and the ribs are inconsistent - 2/3 times they were dry. Stick to the brisket, as it's more consistent, and delicious without sauce. Disappointing as my guests had never had BBQ before, and I had really talked it up."
,,,,,"Never eaten at the restaurant - only delivery - the ribs, brisket, and fresh cut fries are outstanding. Maybe the best I've had in Chicago."
,,,,,Great food but....Not great portion sizes! It's really disappointing for the price. Expected that I was ordering a full meal the way it says on the menu but it was more of a taste test portion. But the dessert is a definite must try!
,,,,,Always good food and very friendly! Would recommend anyone. Mac and cheese is my favorite side
,,,,,"Just got our take out order and almost everyone's meal was delicious (the overall favorite was the chicken). My sliced brisket was super fatty, though, so I called to tell them it was a funky portion. I don't know what I expected, but I haven't had customer service this gracious and friendly in what feels like forever. I really appreciate Maria's kindness and told her we can't wait to come back again soon!"
,,,,,"I've been long overdue for another visit here. For some reason I just don't make it down this area, but I really should schedule a visit more often. Stopped in on this ""chili"" day, just after the polar vortex rode through, for some mighty tasty beef brisket chili. Funny how a 23° day after -51° wind chills, feels like you don't need a jacket."
,,,,,I predict a return visit for some brisket and beans in the near future. Glad I got another pint of chili to go.
,,,,,Boy am I due a return visit here... certainly remember my visit from a while back and Sunday around 4 pm worked well last time. Many delicious items on the menu. The brisket is drop to your knees good. I recommend you go ahead and take a seat before tasting.
,,,,,"The beans are just that good, you might want to consider a double order. "
,,,,,Their food  travels well and worth the trip in from the burbs!
,,,,,"After leaving from Lincoln Park Zoo I took a trip over to get a bite for me and the family. I loved how the business took covid precautions the way they did. Proper PPE required and they even took customer's temperatures for those dining outside. Food was great, 50 dollars worth filled 4 individuals which included a St. Louis rib dinner with Mac and cheese, beans, and cornbread. Next meal was chopped brisket with another Mac and cheese and cornbread with coleslaw. For dessert tried the peach cobbler."
,,,,,"Just picked up carry out during this unusual crazy time, greeted by a group of yellow vested Smoque guys, and Henry (the dining room coordinator extradionaire)coordinates, but doesn't touch any food, only the gloved, vested food runners touch orders and bring to the car. They wouldn't take cash as it's ""unsanitary"". Outstanding! Please pickup delicious carry out from here! "
,,,,,"What an awesome place! The chicken, pulled pork, and all is fantastic! The people are great! Excellent BBQ experience!"
,,,,,What an awesome place! The chicken is fantastic! People are great! Excellent BBQ experience!
,,,,,"We do love good barbecue and have been anxious to check Smoque out since we moved to Chicago. Their ribs and brisket are really delicious, perfectly cooked and deserving of the 4 stars. Have I had better? Yes, but not by a lot. So that's a win. Cute little barbecue shack type look where you order and pick up your food at the counter. It looks like it could get really busy & crowded in there. "
,,,,,"The Coleslaw was great! Theirs is the vinegary variety and is loaded with flavor. Both the Mac & Cheese and Cornbread which were served in tiny oven tins were dry & just not worthy. I also didn't understand the sauce situation. My ribs came with 1 tiny container, my husband got 2 different ones. The containers were way too small to dip a rib into plus there wasn't enough sauce to even decide if I liked it. Squeeze bottles of sauce in the restaurant would be a much better option. "
,,,,,Prices are very fair but I wish they also offered a combo platter with multiple meats so you could get a taste of 2 or 3 items. It's always fun to sample in places like this. 
,,,,,We'll absolutely return but next time I'll stick with the meat only options & just order a side of coleslaw.
,,,,,"This place is legit!! The reviews are pretty much right on. It's really good! And having it less than 10 minutes from my house might prove to be dangerous! I had the sliced brisket platter with the brisket chili (which was a little watery to my taste but flavorful nonetheless) and fries (more fries than I needed) as my 2 sides. Comes with slaw which was really very good! The brisket was tender, moist, lean and had a nice hint of smoky flavor. Was it the best brisket I ever had? No but I wasn't expecting it to be. That honor belongs to a friend of mine who does the best I've ever had on his Big Green Egg and smokes it low and slow for 16 hours. Yum. "
,,,,,"I tasted my wife's baby back ribs which were awesome. Tender, fall off the bone deliciousness. I'd order those next time. They were really terrific. She opted for the corn bread ( a little small) and the mac and cheese. She loved it all. "
,,,,,This place is a clear winner. I'll be back!!

,,,,,"Mmm, not bad. I feel a bit guilty for leaving a 3-star review, because the service was just that damn good."
,,,,,"The food quality was however.... good -- not to die for. Phil's BBQ in San Diego, California is still definitely number one in my books. "
,,,,,I'd highly recommend the brisket (about 10% fatty) and pulled pork sandwich. The pulled pork on its own is just too overwhelming -- like you're swimming in pork (eh).
,,,,,The best dry rub pork ribs in Chicago. I get the St. Louis cut. They are pull part tender with just the right mount of smoke. These ribs are accompanied by two sauces. Memphis (sweet and tangy) Carolina (vinegar base) both good but I prefer the Memphis for these ribs. Carolina goes great with the fries :)
,,,,,"The meal comes with a vinegar cole slaw and a choice of two sides. Because I am pro carbs, I opt for the fries and Mac and cheese. Their corn bread is pretty good though so I get a side of that too. "
,,,,,"Since I do not get the chance to stop here often, I also get the sliced brisket platter to go. Juicy tenders slices of brisket again with the right amount of smoke served with the same combination of sides and sauces. "
,,,,,Yeah I got two meals nothing wrong with that right? Muuuhahaha get in my belly!
,,,,,I had this place bookmarked for quite some time now and came here yesterday with a family friend who resides in Chicago now. OMG is an understatement on how amazing this bbq is. 
,,,,,"We decided to go with a full rack of baby back ribs and pulled pork. The ribs were cooked to perfection. Im mad i didn't get a full rack of ribs just for myself it was so-amazing. The pulled pork was also good, but no comparisons to the ribs. A full rack comes with coleslaw and 2 sides. We went with the baked beans with burnt ends, which i had much better, but was still good and a side of fries. "
,,,,,This place is legit and and from reading other reviews gets very packed. We decided to come on a Sunday evening with hopes that it a be great day to come with it not being so packed and it was a great decision. We came in and i grabbed a table while my brother from another ordered our food. 
,,,,,"The staff and cashiers here are great. They have cleaning staff that a take your trays after you eat and throw out your food to expedite table for the next arriving guest, which was awesome. I really enjoyed this place and look forward to ordering the Texas ribs on my return. This place is by far out of this world and the bbq here is very good. "
,,,,,If you love bbq and are in the Chicago area i highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed!! I might have to get some dry ice and take a few slab of ribs back with me to N.Y.  
,,,,,I will definitely be back before departing.....
,,,,,Not much to say! The best bbq in the town!!! I've there several times and everything always is perfect... My favorite sliced brisket... Baby ribs and their mac and cheese don't forget thier peach cobbler!
,,,,,"Food is absolutely delish. Food is fresh, and you're in and out super quick, their current curbside is pretty fast too. My only beef is that  their prices are pretty high, especially for their sides which's portions are too small for the price."
,,,,,Best in Chicago.  Just amazing bbq!!! Brisket makes you salivate for days after having it just from imagination of the experience of that meal.
,,,,,One of the best BBQ places in Chicago!
,,,,,Food and service 10/10..
,,,,,They have an outdoor patio with all the necessary precautions in place! Must try!!
,,,,,Smoque bbq was highly rated on yelp and a byob so it had to be a win-win.
,,,,,"Only half of our party had arrived, so they wouldn't let us order. If we did, they couldn't guarantee seating for our whole party. I understand that there is limited seating and it's a popular place, but this rule was a pain in the butt. When the rest of our party did arrive, we ordered and waited a while to be seated because the rush that walked in earlier was happily eating. Luckily, they didn't prepare our orders until we had a table. "
,,,,,Finally we were able to dig in!
,,,,,"All of our platters were served with coleslaw and two choices of sides. Between all of us, we had pulled pork, three orders of sliced brisket, and one order of chopped brisket. Each platter was served with memphis and carolina style barbeque sauce. "
,,,,,"Most of the meat is lean here. The pulled pork was delicious. I really enjoyed the crispy pieces. The chopped and sliced brisket were also very good. Two of our orders of sliced brisket were lean and one wasn't, so the brisket is not totally consistent. In all, the meat was tender and had a nice smoke flavor. The only thing I didn't care for was the Texas sausage. It wasn't memorable; it tasted like a regular sausage."
,,,,,"Now, for the special part of the meal: the sides!"
,,,,,Sides ranked: 1. Beans 2. Coleslaw 3. Gumbo 4. Chili 5. Mac 6. Fries 7. Cornbread
,,,,,"The beans took the gold. They had an addicting smoke flavor and just enough sweetness to make you want to ditch the spoon and drink it out of the container. (Okay, maybe that's just me). But seriously, Smoque BBQ should can the sauce from the bbq beans. I found it even better than the Memphis style and Carolina style sauces."
,,,,,"A very close second was the coleslaw. Thank God they include it on everyone's plate because we all devoured it. Not a single shred was leftover! The coleslaw was crisp, light and refreshing. I love that they didn't weigh it down with a ton of mayo."
,,,,,"The gumbo was in third. It may not technically be a side, but it is the same size, so we'll allow it. The spice level was where a gumbo needed to be. I couldn't find anything wrong with it."
,,,,,"Chili was next. It was heavy on the chili powder, but I enjoyed the kick. "
,,,,,"Mac and cheese took fifth place. Smoque keeps their Mac classic: creamy and topped with breadcrumbs. I was thankful for the small portion, so I could enjoy the other sides as well. "
,,,,,"Second to last, the fries. Just plain ol' fries here folks. Nothing to it."
,,,,,"And in last place, cornbread. Sorry cornbread lovers, but I found it as dry as a day old biscuit."
,,,,,"Smoque BBQ is a great place for barbeque in Chicago. Heck, I even like it more than some bbq places in Texas. Bring your friends, arrive all together, drink some beers, and get that food in your belly! Don't forget to order the bbq beans. Oh,  and if you have room, the bread pudding is full of cinnamon. It's delicious and I normally hate bread pudding."
,,,,,"Great BBQ. We dropped by to collect a large box of ribs and chicken for a picnic. The pick-up process was easy and efficient, and food was excellent! Highly recommend."
,,,,,I've had a lot of brisket around Texas etc. This was the most sub-par I've had in a long time. Look at other photos from other reviewers. That bark is fake. Real bark comes from hours of smoking. You can't have that black a bark with almost zero smoke ring...

,,,,,I'll keep this short and sweet....Best barbecue I've ever had! Hands down! I've ordered everything at Smoque and it's all delicious. My absolute favorites being the brisket sand the baby back ribs. The sides are all amazing as well from the baked mac and cheese to the corn bread. You really can't go wrong and I would advise trying something different every time you go. Absolutely the best bbq and prices are reasonable as well. Need I say more?
,,,,,"This was some of the best BBQ I've had.  I'm not expert, but it's second only to Pecan Lodge in Dallas.  I got a half a rack of St. Louis ribs with coleslaw, brisket chili, and fries.  The ribs had a great char, but the Memphis barbecue sauce on top made it incredible.  The coleslaw was fine, but obviously not why I was there.  The brisket chili was pretty good, definitely a Texas style chili.  It had good flavor and a little spice.  The fries were solid, nice and crispy but not greasy.  I'd recommend going with the baked beans (I had a spoonful of my friend's).  I also had the peach cobbler and it was great.  I would recommend it if somehow you have room for it after everything else."
,,,,,"Everything here is great, service is friendly and everything is organized effectively."
,,,,,"I've been told about this place & how it is one of the best BBQ in the city. Therefore, this place had some high expectations from me.. & it they were met and exceeded! Located a block down and right past the interstate on Pulaski and Irving Park, Smoque is in its own tiny hot spot. I came here for dinner on a weekday night RIGHT BEFORE the line grew outside the doors. "
,,,,,"The menu is small, which is ideal for an indecisive person like me...but has all the essential american BBQ options like Ribs (baby back & st. louis style), brisket, chicken, pull pork, and sausage. "
,,,,,"Also, most entrees include a couple sides with the meal and coleslaw. Sides are fries, brisket chili, mac and cheese, cornbread, and beans. I had the chopped brisket with slaw, mac&cheese, and cornbread. MAN OH MAN, the mac&cheese was a small serving but soft, fluffy, and delicious! The cornbread is equivalent to the child of Famous Dave's cornbread (if you know, they have the BEST cornbread ever) with corn inside. Lastly, my food came with a Caroline BBQ sauce & and Memphis style BBQ sauce that i would interchangeably switch back and forth on my brisket. OOOO baby, it was a good, quick bite that came out pretty quick! Mark my word, I'll be back to get some of those good good ribs i saw others had."
,,,,,12/10
,,,,,"I worked with Smoque to cater a backyard rehearsal dinner and was so pleased with their food and service!  Peggy, our catering representative, was always responsive and knowledgable with my many questions.  We ended up over-ordering (it's a bad day when you run out of bbq) and really should've gone with Peggy's numbers, so definitely trust their recommendation.  "
,,,,,"The food was extremely well packaged, and came with all the fixings/utensils/etc. we could have wanted - planned very well on their end!  The meal was absolutely delicious, brisket and pulled pork went fast.  And please do yourself a favor and get the bread pudding, it's amazing!  "
,,,,,"At the time, they did have a few Covid precautions in place as it pertained to delivery.  Originally, we were planning to have someone set up the chaffing dishes and food for us, but that option was still not available at the time of our event.  Not a problem though as I very much respected the precautions put in place to protect their staff."
,,,,,Always good BBQ Brisket and sides! Coleslaw is amazing! Very responsible with their covid protocol! I've been going to smoque for over 10 years and still consistently awesome!
,,,,,Not a fan of the ribs but that's a personal choice because I have lots of friends that do like them!
,,,,,"Solid BBQ for the Midwest. You order your food first and then one of the Smoque employees directs your group to a seating area. The place was busy but the wait wasn't too bad, maybe 15-20 minutes (this was 6 pm on a weeknight)."
,,,,,"My group of 4 decided to share a bunch of stuff: 1.25 lb of sliced brisket, full slab of baby back ribs, large BBQ beans, large mac & cheese, large fresh cut fries, and 3 cornbreads.  We chose sliced brisket over chopped for its higher fat content, definitely worth the extra calories. Included with the order were 3 types of sauce (Memphis style, Spicy Memphis style, Carolina style). The Spicy Memphis was my favorite -- I dipped everything in it! While the four of us were able to finish everything, we were absolutely STUFFED. We probably should have gotten one less side and stuck with 1 lb of brisket."
,,,,,"I thought the brisket was the star of the show. It was super tender and juicy and tasted amazing with any of the sauces. Ribs were good, nice and smokey. Out of all the sides we got, I enjoyed the beans and fries the most. I'm not usually a beans type of person, but the Smoque version was bursting with flavor. The fries were hot and fresh and tasted great dipped in BBQ sauce. Cornbread was decent although I couldn't tell you what constitutes good cornbread (I might have been too full to appreciate it). The biggest disappointment was the mac & cheese. The ""large"" we got was simply two of their pre-portioned containers, which are pretty small. Honestly it tasted pretty bland and the texture was not creamy or cheesy whatsoever. Would skip next time."
,,,,,"Overall, I'd come back here for the meat, though I'm not too excited about those sides."
,,,,,"We love the pulled pork sandwiches, beans and cornbread as well as their homemade sauces."
,,,,,"Always good food and nice staff. Only problem are the crowds, but they do move the line fast. If you like barbecue, you won't be disappointed."

,,,,,"There are three (3) authentic BBQ destinations in the USA: Memphis, TN, East or West, Texas and 'Smoque BBQ', Chicago, IL. How do you know what you are consuming is authentic and truly BBQ? One answer: the flavor of the 'Smoque' permeating the meat. The balance between bitter and sweet / acidic and alkaline; it must be perfect. Perfect? Yes: present but not dominant, infused by one another not simply intertwined and never-ever should the smoque mask the flavor of the meat. There is ONLY ONE TYPE OF MEAT and ONLY ONE CUT OF THAT MEAT: BRISKET -- that offers this level of gourmand certainty. A cut of meat that is bold enough to stand up to the most interesting of BBQ that also comes out moist and infused: to be dressed as you please: CHOPPED BRISKET (not sliced)."
,,,,,"'SMOQUE BBQ' is a destination for BBQ aficionados, just as Alice Waters' restaurant 'Chez Panisse' in Berkeley, CA is a destination for lovers of authentic California cuisine. These are two completely different types of restaurants, but they are equal In quality of ingredients, preparation and attention to the guests."
,,,,,"And of course, as any great symphony needs a great conductor; a great restaurant needs a great Maître d'hôte. Much of the reason that 'Smoque BBQ' is so successful, especially given the high-volume and continuous-flow seating needs of their guests;  'front-of-house' expert and Maître d'hôte Carlos. His passion is a genuine passion--a continual attention to his guests--wants and needs. An enthusiasm one finds, only at food palaces such as Tour d'Argent in Paris.  "
,,,,,"He said to me today, 'Welcome Mr Peter. I believe this table would be best for your needs today.' I looked at him, then the table and his certainty; then said to myself, ""Just sit down where Carlos wants you to. One does not question an expert."" He was right as usual. Lunch was great. "
,,,,,"Carlos has a gift and a finely honed skill. 'Smoque BBQ' has a selection of delicious BBQ easily accessible on the web. They also have specials that Carlos and the other staff point out as one decides what to order. He enjoys his work and is a confident, yet humble man (trait of a great service professional). We laughed as my wife photographed us, against the new construction going on. And as he assisted my wife and I, to the door, we felt like the most important people in Chicago. And, that is as good as dining-out gets."
,,,,,"Great service great food a little pricey but worth it, great to enjoy with family and friends"
,,,,,"I've ordered from here a few times! It's one of the best BBQ places in the city! I recommend the smoked sausage, honestly it's to die for! The Mac and cheese and ribs are also hot items I would get again!"
,,,,,"St. Louis ribs were very good, as was the mac and cheese. Cornbread had good flavor but could have been baked longer. Got out on hold for too long to order, so ordered easily online. Great curb side pickup service."
,,,,,Love Smoque. They have the best ribs and sauces. We always do pick up when we're in the area.
,,,,,Delicious pandemic dinner full of comfort. The leftovers make great sandwiches and lunches for future meals. Getting a family style protein from Smoque and making a big salad or a few sides is a savvy way to please the everyone or even just be very please with yourself.
,,,,,"Delicious as always! I had the half slab rib dinner - St. Louis style (baby back also available for the same price). It came with cole slaw and two sides. I chose baked beans, which had chunks of brisket in it, and fries, which were coated in a barbecue spice rub. I finished everything except the fries - I always forget how many they give you."
,,,,,Always delicious ribs or brisket platter. I wish the desert was still considered a side like when they first opened. It's peach cobbler and really yummy and baked crispy!
,,,,,"French fries, Mac and cheese always delicious!"
,,,,,We always love our food at Smoque.
,,,,,"The brisket is my favorite, Mac and cheese and the peach cobbler!!! Always a line order in advance."
,,,,,Fantastic food and I love the space itself. I've had tons of barbecue over the years and this has to be one of the better barbecue places I've been in a while. 
,,,,,"It was quite busy when we were there and the staff kept up with the pace but the eating area was very congested with people waiting to order at the counter. It feels like the counter space should be reversed with the ordering station and the pick up station being swapped. It seems like that would help with traffic flow. Plus, the person taking the order stops in between customers to enter handwritten phone in or take away orders which is kind of weird, just buy another iPad. "

We have been here before but after this last experience, I don't think we will be back. The fries were dead and the brisket had too much fat. The cornbread was good and the staff is very helpful. The bbq sauce is also very good. We just didn't love the food."
,,,,,"This place serves up some mean meat. Every type of smoked meat from them has been tender, juicy and soo flavorful. But it doesn't end there. The French fries are"
,,,,,"so delicious too!! Try their peach cobbler too, you won't be disappointed."
,,,,,Love the bbq!! So delicious! The bbq sauce was really great. One of my favorite bbq place in town.

,,,,,"Boy. ""How about BBQ?"""
,,,,,"Me:  ""Sure.  Just figure it out."" (meaning:  stop bothering me)"
,,,,,"The Boy did good.  I mean, REALLY GOOD.  We ordered baby back ribs and the brisket platter.  I took one bite and it was OVER.  I shared a rib or two and then it was ALL MINE.  The ribs have a decent amount of meat so that kept me quiet (haha) and the sauces were tasty!  The brisket was tender and perfectly smoked.  Overall, we were super happy with our meal."
,,,,,"The Boy picked up the food, stating that ""it was quite a production.""  He was impressed with their system and felt it was safe and organized.  We will definitely order again."
,,,,,"Love this place since its so near to where I live, Smoque never disappoints.  There is usually a line but it is worth the wait."
,,,,,One of the the best BBQ places in Chicago! You order at the counter and then have the option of indoor or outdoor seating (weather permitting). I usually get a platter with 2 sides. I've tried almost all the meat options and the brisket and pulled pork are out of this world. 
,,,,,All the sides are good but I really love the Mac n cheese and the cornbread. You can also get a sandwich or platter with slaw which is also amazing. The place is usually packed and nothing fancy but if you are looking for some delicious meat Smoque is the place to go. There are a few options for sauce and you really can't go wrong!
,,,,,Loved this spot! They set up a small outdoor picnic table area to eat during COVID 19. They take everyone's temperature m. You order before you sit down to minimize contact between staff and customers. Always get the brisket and the Mac and Cheese is perfect with beans :)
,,,,,This place is great. They're a neighbor staple. Their BBQ is amazing! The whole menu too to bottom is delicious. And they are run like a well oiled machine. The turn around on orders is quick and the series exceptional. It's a must visit!
,,,,,Update: I just want to say that since shut down I have eaten ribs from Smoque six times. I see how very careful they are and I feel very confident that they are doing everything to keep their employees safe and keeping us enjoying these amazing dishes. Thank you to all who work there for being so awesome! 
,,,,,I am officially addicted. I love the St. Louis ribs with no bbq sauce to ruin it. I also like their vinegar based coleslaw. The employees are kind and friendly and the gentlemen working there hold the door open for you with a smile which is really nice and leaves me with a happy feeling. I love Smoque BBQ!

,,,,,"So I was very excited to try Smoque because, like everyone else around here, I had heard very good things about this place. I ended up trying the brisket, the ribs, and the chicken. While I thought the meat was cooked nicely, I felt like there was something missing on the seasoning front. I thought that the BBQ itself was missing more of a salty char taste. I feel like I've had much better seasoned BBQ from other places around the city, including my family's backyard. "
,,,,,"I also would have preferred more variety in BBQ sauce-perhaps a spicy sauce and a sweet Carolina mustard would be great additions. The sides were pretty tasty, though. I thought the mac and cheese was done well. The crunchy topping was delicious. I also preferred the style of coleslaw they serve (more vinegar-y) because I don't like my slaw coated in tons of mayo. "
,,,,,"Service was great and everyone working there was attentive. It seemed like they had so many employees there working at once, which is a good thing because it was impossible not to have someone helping you if you needed it. I thought that the prices were pretty high for the portions you get. Fair warning, I think that portions for the brisket and the mac and cheese are especially small. "
,,,,,"Personally, I just thought everything was ok. I don't think this is a place I will be going out of my way to travel to."
,,,,,Wow...what  great joint.    
,,,,,"I ordered a half slab of St Louis Ribs and a side of sliced brisket.   Both were excellent.   Tender, nicely seasoned, very very good.    The brisket was so tender, it just melted in my mouth.    Six pieces of ribs, brisket, fries, mac and cheese and slaw was a lot of food....Maybe next time, I can split with a friend and get only 3 ribs, the brisket and share a side dish."
,,,,,"Great staff, very clean, very busy."
,,,,,"We had a proper Memphis-style bbq dinner here during our tour of Chicago. While the ribs and pulled pork and brisket were wonderful, the star of the show was the not-on-the-menu candies jalapeños! Sweet yet slightly spicy, these little atomic morsels were unique and delicious! We also enjoy the brisket chili which was packed with flavor! "
,,,,,"The best part was the friendly and helpful service. Everyone took care of us, taking away our dishes, and bringing us to-go containers when it was time to hit the road. "
,,,,,"As for drinks, they only have the soft variety but they have no issue with byob. So, byob we did!"
,,,,,"Ordered the take out brisket from here.  I will say that the brisket and sauce were absolutely amazing!  My only ding about it is that they don't give you a lot of portions in comparison to other BBQ places I've been to, and the prices are slightly higher."
,,,,,I will come back here when I don't feel like driving to the South Side to another BBQ place to get my tips that I won't mention here....  :)
,,,,,"You know, I came here during the midst of the pandemic, and I understand they are doing their best. Overall the set up was clean and organised, and the food was delicious. Just felt a bit overpriced, and also felt like it was a copy of Bub City in downtown, just different names for everything, and quantity. Would I come back? Yes just not often."
,,,,,"So I came here for the first time during Covid of 2020 in September. It was outdoor seating, and very spacious, that's good! The cleanliness of the tables were impeccable. Though the food, was good, it wasn't the best. But the prices were fair. I feel like the meat, despite adding more sauce to it, was a bit dry. Other than that, I'd go again."
,,,,,"Prior to the Governor's shutdown of restaurants, this was a favorite spot of mine. The ribs were very good but I'd have to bring along my own Open Pit sauce they don't carry it, they have their own varieties. Parking is tight since it's a residential neighborhood but if you come at off peak hour, you should be able to find a spot."
,,,,,I mean..... The half chicken is probably the best dam thing in the world. I usually love my Latin specially colombian Style Chicken.  This place has turned me into an addict. The Mac and Cheese are beyond solid. All around 10! I am lucky to live close by. These guys during covid-19 are organized and picking up is so painless.
,,,,,"Great outdoor seating with a tent set up, fast service, great Q. Enjoy the chopped brisket with a corn muffin and baked Mac."
,,,,,Best bbq in Chicago! I love the Memphis style sauce and that's coming from a former Memphian

,,,,,"Why the 4 stars?  The portions are small compared to the prices.  A slab of ribs is on the small side.  Not alot of meat..  I have a feeling they cut 3-4 pieces off each slab and sell them as a ""taste""..    the sides are also on the small side.  They should sell a larger Mac n cheese."
,,,,,"Basically, some of the best BBQ in Chicago. Haven't had a single item that I would hesitate to order again. Just wish that Smoque was closer to home instead of a 15 minute drive!"
,,,,,There's a reason Smoque is always busy!! 
,,,,,Their food is so amazing. The best barbecue I've ever had in Chicago!!! Beef brisket is always a go to and I actually LOVE the coleslaw here and I usually hate coleslaw!! 
,,,,,There's really nothing to go into detail with here. It's a great place. It's busy. It's worth it. 
,,,,,Enough said!!
,,,,,Consistently excellent BBQ and service. Great brisket and I love their St. Louis ribs with the Carolina sauce. 
,,,,,"The pulled pork is decent, if that's your jam. "
,,,,,Good cornbread and Mac and cheese.
,,,,,"This place never disappoints.  I ordered a feast for my family and friends - ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, salads and dessert - and even the cat got in on the Smoque BBQ action! So good... if you're wondering about this place, don't.  Just go in (their patio is open) or do like me and order for pick-up. It'll be so worth it!"
,,,,,"I had heard so many good things about Smoque and didn't get the chance to try it pre-pandemic. I ordered delivery and it was amazing!! Arrived on time, everything was as I had ordered. Their mac and cheese is to die for"
,,,,,Excellent what else can you say all great have been a longtime customer best BBQ IN CHICAGO!!
,,,,,Delicious bbq that we get delivered when we splurge on a cheat meal! We love the Mac n cheese! We also love the brisket & pulled pork! All the sauces are to die for!
,,,,,"Best barbecue we have ever had, ever! There's a reason Smoque has made it onto TV shows. You can't order anything on the menu that isn't simply amazing. Quick service, long lines but always worth the wait. I typically order the brisket or ribs and we always get the peach cobbler for dessert."

,,,,,Been looking for a decent bbq place in Chicago and I'm so happy I came across Smoque!
,,,,,Inside it's a very low key space with the menu on the wall. When we walked in a guy welcomed us and gave us a paper menu. The girl talking orders was very nice and gave us recommendations on what to get. We decided to vibe with ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese and cornbread for sides. 
,,,,,"The drinks are fill on your own with a basic soda fountain, and they call your name whenever your order is ready. They serve it on cute bbq trays and you can really tell that the ladies behind the counter enjoy what they do. "
,,,,,Ok so food. YUMMMMM. 
,,,,,The ribs were delicious Saint Louis style with that AHMAZING smoky meat. Literally delishhh
,,,,,The brisket was a bit fatty but had that smoke ring flavoring it as well! 
,,,,,The Mac and cheese was alright with a nice topping. The cornbread was a bit dry and I think it might have been better with some butter. 
,,,,,"Regardless everything was sooo good and def a place I would visit again. If you're ever hungry for some good bbq, this is your place!"

,,,,,"Absolutely the best bbq in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. Delicious brisket no too fatty like orders, they trim here and give you a fair price. The pulled pork is also delicious. This is THE PLACE."
,,,,,Great food and atmosphere. The workers are friendly and quick to help. Great spot for some bbq
,,,,,"First time at Smoque for lunch was a great experience. What a gem for some great BBQ! The smoke flavor and ring on the ribs was perfect, no sauce was even needed. The pulled pork sandwich was very meaty and the flavor was outstanding. The pulled pork plate was hearty and all our sides of slaw, bbq beans, and fries were so so good! Parking can be tough along the street, but it's worth it! Will definitely be going back when back in the city."
,,,,,"Standard BBQ. Not sure what the hype is about. The wait staff has a take it or leave it attitude, which can get annoying. But if your in the area and craving BBQ it will do the job."
,,,,,"Got the chopped brisket and st Louis ribs with cornbread, beams, Mac and cheese "
,,,,,"Brisket: kinda dry and not much flavor,  drowning it in the sauce helps"
,,,,,"Ribs: they are good, but for the top barbecue place on yelp it's pretty average"
,,,,,"Cornbread: a little dry, not sweet, nothing special "
,,,,,Mac and cheese: Mediocre 
,,,,,"Beans: ok, not bad"
,,,,,Overall disappointing. The best part is the sauce. It's very good. But the meat just isn't there
,,,,,"This place is amazing! My son always gets the ribs and I always get the brisket. Since they open this place I have been a fan. Best customer service as well, the one time I had a complaint they went above and beyond to satisfy their customer."
,,,,,"This place has some awesome BBQ. Located in the northwest suburbs of Chicago Smoque delivers on some great smoked BBQ ranging from St Louis style ribs, to brisket, to pulled pork. "
,,,,,They serve platters of all the main dishes and allow you to add on other meats if your that hungry. The sides are great as well. I had the Mac and cheese and Coleslaw and both went great with the meat. 
,,,,,Don't don't drive through West Garfield Park to get to Irving. That neighborhood is horrible and looks like Baghdad in 2005.
,,,,,"Honestly, this BBQ is great. The food is wonderful and the sauce is amazing! Definitely worth a try and worth a repeat"
,,,,,"Hands down the best in the COUNTRY.  I have had bbq and smoked food in Georgia, Texas, Tennessee, California, and the Carolinas.. bar none these guys are the best.  The brisket is truely award winning and the Kansas city ribs should come with a trophy.  Mac and cheese has layers a flavor and the cobbler is even scrumptious.  Order ahead or expect to wait for this must see hidden treasure in Chicago."
,,,,,"I was so impressed by how many reviews Smoque had that I had to give it a try. Overall, I liked it, but it wasn't the most amazing bbq I've ever had. I do think it hits the spot though so if you are craving standard bbq fare, this is a good place for you. "
,,,,,They currently offer curbside pickup with a well-organized waiting lane. You can stay in your car while someone collects the food from inside and brings it to you. It was very efficient and the whole process took maybe 2 minutes. 
,,,,,"I ordered the sliced brisket platter, which comes with color slaw and 2 sides, as well as 2 dipping sauces. The brisket was extremely tender and had a nice smoky flavor to it. It is also extremely fatty, so if you're not a fan of that you may want to go for the chopped brisket. I liked the dipping sauces it came with and I thought they enhanced the flavor. "
,,,,,"The Mac and cheese was my favorite part of the whole meal. It comes with delicious breading on top and a thick, hearty cheese sauce. I liked that the portion wasn't gigantic but filling at the same time. The cornbread was served warm and also tasted great -- it was so warm it crumbled right off the fork. The Cole Slaw was more vinegar-based than Mayo-based. I wish it was a bit creamier, but it complemented the brisket and sides well without being too heavy. "
,,,,,"I will definitely keep this place in mind if I feel like having standard, straightforward bbq again. It was just what I was looking for!"

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60641"
,,,,,"I would probably go 3.5.  They were solid don't get me wrong.   But not exceptional,  and definitely not the best bbq in the city.   It's no better than any of these other counter style bbq restaurants.  Point being if you don't live close,  no need to make a cross town drive.  "
,,,,,"With that being said the ribs were decent 3,/5,  and my wife had chopped brisket sandwich 4/5.  I think i would prefer the sliced brisket.   For my sides i did fries and mac and cheese, it automatically comes with Coleslaw.  The mac and cheese is below average and the coleslaw i wasn't a fan of, i prefer more of creamy slaw,  this was dryer.  The fries were fresh cut i liked them. 4/5 I also tried the Texas Sausage it was good 4/5.  Reminds me of a eckridge sausage, but smoked to perfection. Don't live close so i probably won't be back."
,,,,,"Not much can be said that hasn't already.  Smoque is where its at.  Unfortunately for my waistline, this location is by my house and their downtown location is by my office, so you can imagine I order this way too much.  Sliced brisket is amazing, brisket chili is a great side, and both dessert options (peach cobbler and bread pudding) are wonderful.  Bread pudding especially...whew."
,,,,,"Also, even though the brisket totally doesn't need it, the sauces are excellent."
,,,,,"If I had a critique, I'm not a huge fan of their cornbread.  Its a touch on the dry side for me.  But thats why the brisket chili is the side to get :)."
,,,,,Service was great and professional. I ordered ribs and couple other things. Food was ok ribs were just undercooked. A little tough but not bad
,,,,,"Been trying to find time to venture out to Irving Park and try out Smoque for years. Finally went and was...disappointed. Ordered Brisket, ribs, mac n' cheese, and slaw. "
,,,,,The sides were perfectly fine. Small portions but cheap. Nothing to write home about.
,,,,,"Ribs were also fine, but slightly lacking in flavor. "
,,,,,"The brisket was the most disappointing. It was very dry (minus, obviously, the fat cap) and also under-seasoned. Also very little smoke flavor. Sauce is great as an add-on to brisket, but I shouldn't need it. "
,,,,,"The sausage was the highlight of the meal. Highly recommend if you're going, but not worth going to Smoque just for it. "
,,,,,"Sadly, sticking to Green Street for my Chicago smoked meats."
,,,,,Best beef brisket and baked beans in the world.   We do not eat pork but the chicken was good too. No sweet potatoe pie was looking 4 it.  We will go back 4 sure
,,,,,"Been going here multiple times, this Smoque BBQ is so amazing! Their customer service was so great, their environment is so feel home, and their place has a good ambiance. You can smell the air when you go inside, it is smell of good delicious barbeque, and you will probably get your order immediately. Their barbeque is very tasty, it is so tender, flavorful, and meaty. The portions are right, sauce and dips are awesome, and beverages are cool. And also they have so many mouth-watering meals that you can try at their menu and great sides as well. Their place is so easy to find, they have parking lot so you can park while you are eating inside, and this place is the favorite spot of most people in the area. This is the best barbeque place here in Chicago, if you are also a barbeque lover this is definitely the best and perfect place for you. So I suggest to go here and stop by, much better if you go here earlier because the store is so crowded in late hours, but it is still up to you, everything here at Smoque BBQ is so worth the cost. And everything about this place is so impressive, from their customer service, employees, place, and especially their food. This store is not going to disappoint you. Hands down to them. Highly recommend this Smoque BBQ, you can always get a delicious meal here, and they are always quick and efficient. Will definitely go here again when I am nearby. Thank you guys! Keep up the good work! Kudos to all of you!"
,,,,,"Damn, the food is good here."
,,,,,"I ordered ahead and picked up tonight for dinner.  I ordered the brisket, mac and cheese and cole slaw.  My friend ordered  a slab of baby back ribs, beans and both had corn bread which came in a little individual baking dishes.  "
,,,,,"Honestly, this is some of the best Barbecue in the entire city, in my opinion.  The brisket was outstanding.  The sauce is just great."
,,,,,"It looked pretty cool inside.  They're doing curbside pickup only these days, but once they reopen, I'll be heading there again for dinner or lunch inside."
,,,,,Located on Pulaski and Grace.  I will be back!
,,,,,We go for the chopped brisket . Delicious!  We also like the baby back ribs.  The fries are fresh cut and the best in the area!
,,,,,"Gave a safe haven to a white supremacist after he committed a hate crime. Yikes. Also, ate here once a few years ago. Never went back, mediocre at best so you're not missing much. Like, it's food. It's edible? Kinda like unseasoned chicken. Meh."
,,,,,Overrated over priced bullshit. Shit ain't Franklins B. I mean all the BBQ in Chicago kinda blows which is crazy cause the basketball team is literally named after the meat industry that we were at the forefront of.

,,,,,My first visit here-can't believe it took me so long and I'll be back and will make a point of going back for certain.
,,,,,A recent trip included having a chopped brisket dinner (photo attached) that included the best tasting brisket I've ever had.   Great without any sauce and even better with just a couple drops of regular sauce on it.
,,,,,"Sides were decent-which is why I'm at 4 stars-I rate based on expectations-with the cole slaw just ok, the mac 'n cheese solid and the baked beans were tasty."
,,,,,I took home a half slab of the baby back ribs and those were great at dinner the same evening.
,,,,,Sliced brisket and pecan bourbon bread pudding are my family's go to items at Smoque BBQ.  I've had their entire menu and these items left the biggest impression and call my cravings back for more.
,,,,,"Not sure what the hype is all about. Ordered a full slap of St Louis & Baby Back ribs, 1/2 lb each of sliced and chopped brisket. Both styled ribs were dry and lacked flavor. The briskets were mildly more flavorful but also quite dry. The meats all required a dousing of bbq sauce to make them palatable. The side dishes weren't much better. The slaw, corn bread, chili, mac n cheese  and fries were mediocre. "
,,,,,"This place felt like is an overhyped, overpriced tourist trap in my opinion. Would not recommend. Definitely will not go back."
,,,,,Delicious.   Every time is amazing.  The best macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten.   I just can't boast enough.
,,,,,"Where do I even start? The food here is just beyond impecable. Such rich flavors and tender meat. I ordered the brisket burger and let me tell you, I was thoroughly impressed. The brisket was nicely smoked and juicy and the portion was huge! I will definitely be ordering from here again soon."
,,,,,"I enjoy Smoque, I have had their food a few times. I will say their portions are small for the price. Other than that it's good bbq"
,,,,,"This place is OMG, HOLY FREAKING-COW AWESOME!!!!  I've been here over a dozen times and the food just gets better and better and better every time I go here. No brisket this time but 2 slabs of ribs, mac n cheese and cole slaw....YUMMY. "
,,,,,Curbside pickup only today due to the Corona virus pandemic. Really needed this and SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESSES!!!!
,,,,,"I have to say that I have had BBQ in LOTS of places around the US, but this place is DA BOMB!!!!!  The best ribs, the BEST Mac 'n' cheese,and the brisket is A W E S O M E!!!!!!!!  If you like BBQ and you need a place to go, TRY THIS PLACE!!  There is usually a line out the door and parking can be an issue but it is worth the wait!!  YUMMY!!"
,,,,,"I was looking for catering for a training, and Smoque was able to help with less than 48 hours notice! They are super responsive, and can help give suggestions where needed. We ended up trying:"
,,,,,"-Sliced Brisket: Yum, really good! The pieces were a mix between moist and lean, and I loved the moist/fattier pieces. The brisket was very tender, and the bark was flavorful."
,,,,,"-Texas Sausage: Solid, but on the peppery side. "
,,,,,"-Macaroni & Cheese: I loved the panko topping, and this was one of my favorite versions of mac n cheese I've had from a BBQ place in a while."
,,,,,"-Cole Slaw: Solid cole slaw, and the cabbage and veggies were fresh."
,,,,,3800 N Pulaski Rd
,,,,,"-Cornbread: Solid, and their version had kernels of corn in it."
,,,,,"-Pecan Bread Pudding (w/Bourbon Caramel Sauce): Yum, this dessert is rich and decadent. The bourbon caramel sauce added even more richness. It was a little too sweet for me, but I enjoyed the few bites that I had."
,,,,,"Overall, Smoque is a solid BBQ spot to check out if you're in Chicago! Or if you need last minute catering for your event. They delivered everything on time, and the food all looked great. You can even request they bring plates, utensils, etc."
,,,,,"Efficient curbside pick up, decent food, and nice staff. "
,,,,,"I had high hopes in trying out this bbq joint because of its reviews. I'm originally from Kansas city though, so I still tried to manage my expectations. "
,,,,,"Overall food is decent. Brisket was a bit dry and cold. Bread is good, substantial and soft enough to hold brisket bbq. Small size mac n cheese. Good size fries and coleslaw. Fries on the soggy side. Coleslaw is yummy because its vinegary not mayonaise-y.  "
,,,,,"The sausage is good though, that i will get again for sure. "
,,,,,"Maybe we just ordered at the wrong time or arrived at a wrong day. Despite that, still one of the better bbq joints in chicagoland area. It just so happen I'm from kansas city and used to KC BBQ."
,,,,,"Verdict: will come back and try it again, i guess. But will keep searching for 'our-GO-TO' bbq place here in Chicago."
,,,,,The ribs has a nice char and smoky flavor make sure you to get some spicy Memphis sauce . The beef briar chili was very tasty along with the cornbread muffins. I would definitely go back to try pulled pork

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60641"
,,,,,"Great BBQ, been going here for years. You basically can't go wrong with any choice: ribs, brisket, Mac & cheese... all good stuff. My favorite BBQ place in Chicago."
,,,,,"It's always good when you find a place that does such a good job with the brisket that you can eat it without BBQ sauce! The brisket was good but honestly, my favorite thing was the baked beans! Really great Smokey flavor with good size pieces of meat in the beans. I was glad they had an outdoor dining area. It's nice to be able to sit outside, even if it's not really a beautiful area to look at."
,,,,,My only complaint is they do not serve beer. A beer would have been very complimentary to this meal!
,,,,,"Very decent bbq, good portions and prices. Never disappointed with the service either."
,,,,,The food was fantastic tried the brisket pulled pork and the Texas sausage. Mac and cheese is very tasty and the fries are insanely good. Reasonable priced for BBQ and the portions were generous. Would have shared a picture but the smells led us to eating before we even thought to take a snap shot. Will definitely get food from here again.
,,,,,"The bbq sauce is really the main show here in my opinion. Great smoked meats, delicious bbq sauce, although I wish they had an option with more heat."
,,,,,"The Capricorn Cutie at the cashier register was very very patient and helpful with me, we shared laughs, she also very professional taking my order. "
,,,,,"The brisket was very moist and tender. The beans were relatively good too, But the coleslaw was not even worth mentioning,  excuse me..  I should've brought it up."
,,,,,"Updating Yelp reviews with the new ratings system. Ordered delivery back in September. Food arrived on time and it only took about 45 minutes on a weekend. They will run out of food especially on weekends, like St. Louis style ribs, as they make limited quantities. Mac n Cheese is still bomb. It's super cheesy, not overly rich and comes with solid bread crumbs on top. The cole slaw is pretty vinegary and too much for my taste, but the slaw is very fresh/crunchy. The brisket is still the best in Chicago. Very flavorful, not overly fatty, a nice char, and it has a perfect smoke ring. I still think that the St. Louis style ribs are some of the best ribs that I've ever had. They are smoky, super tender, meaty, and they don't need any sauce. The pulled pork is solid and the sauces are awesome! The Memphis style sauce has a little bit of a small kick. Smoque is still not the best BBQ I've had as I still think the Peg Leg Porker in Nashville is better. But Smoque is still the best I've had in Chicago, easily beating Green Street Smoked Meats, Smoke Daddy, Bub City, and others I've tried."
,,,,,Smoque is considered to be one of the best BBQ places in the United States and boy does it live up to the hype!!! 
,,,,,The mix of their dry rub and sauce on their St. Louis style ribs is amazing! The sauce isn't overkill so it doesn't take away from the flavors of the rub and smoky meat. I love their brisket as well. Smoque's Mac and Cheese is the best Mac and Cheese at a BBQ joint in Chicago. 
,,,,,I will be coming back here as long as I live in Chicago!
,,,,,So so good. Both my boyfriend and I love this place. He always order like 3-4 bread puddings just for himself smh
,,,,,"There are few places like that, where you can find such a balance. Good quality, delicious meat and sauces that are harmonious in quantity and quality. The staff was surprisingly good and it felt like they were working as a team. They were smiling and friendly, they would tell you about the menu based on taste considerations. The atmosphere was not tense, you can sit  and  enjoy together with friends. There was a minor incident, that was resolved very tactful and polite. We will definitely come again."

,,,,,"First come this place yesterday. Ordered chicken with two side and pulled pork. Was very delicious. Nice guys working,fast served,responsible price. Definitely recommend and come back"
,,,,,"Absolutely amazing, never disappoints!!! The quality is superb and the staff is always extremely friendly!!!"
,,,,,"Visited with an out of town friend (from Chicago) who was lusting over their BBQ specifically and we were really surprised by their outdoor seating/COVID precautions. They have an outdoor kiosk where you order, then tables outside under a tent, and food and utensils are brought out to you, to minimize any moving around. I like the half chicken -- it's a big portion, despite what the other reviews say, and the sauces are great. Mac and cheese is also stellar. Don't listen to the people who are annoyed about having to be respectful of others DURING A PANDEMIC -- the outdoor seating and service was great. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"I haven't been here in years, but I was recently watching an old episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that was all about BBQ, and featured Smoque. My sister who is visiting naturally started craving ribs so we came here.  And OMFG! I remembered they were good, but forgot how good. My mother, sister, and I slaughtered our meals. "
,,,,,"Also,  Smoque is doing COVID precautions right. Nobody allowed inside, sectioned curbside pickup,  two waiting tents for pickup,  cashless,  and distanced patio seating. Staff was friendly and owner was on site, up front, with hands on deck. "
,,,,,"BBQ is heavy eating which is why I don't do it often, but I'm going to definitely try and start ordering from here more frequently."
,,,,,"Smoque is very very solid BBQ. The chicken is on point, the watermelon tea will definitely change your life. 2nd best brisket in Chicago. For a long time this was one of the only palatable BBQ in Chicago."
,,,,,Food was excellent
,,,,,But they should work on their service 
,,,,,"They had one person taking orders but then a group of people ""serving"" the food.  They should do the Portillo's model where someone has a headset and takes your order and then another person has a handheld credit card reader.  They could bang out so many more customers and much more efficiently"
,,,,,"I'd definitely give them more stars if I could! The food is always amazing, well packaged and super fast delivery! Had a mix up with our Caviar order tonight, but called the restaurant and they graciously gave us options to try to make things right. One of their on site empoyees named Salvador( I hope I remembered his name right, he was so sweet!) ended up delivering our correct order in no time flat& I tried like hell to make him accept some money as a tip but he politely declined since it was ""their mistake"" so sweet but I so wish I could have compensated him for his time, especially since they were so understanding. Your staff has amazing customer service for sure!"
,,,,,Even gave us a gift card for our next order! Above and beyond doesn't even come close! We were beyond grateful for all the accomodation!
,,,,,"I mean, wow. One week later & I'm still thinking about those ribs. And the sauce. And the macaroni"
,,,,,Seems like they feel that people don't like eating .eat anymore.  Back in the day they used to give you a good amount of brisket...really guys...I know meat is more expensive now but people go for bbq for the meat and not tofu...or corn bread...this some bs..
,,,,,"Let me tell you, the bread pudding, sauce and Mac & Cheese are the "

,,,,,My cousin turned me onto these guys. His wife was from Texas where there's some of the best BBQ you can get anyways her opinion was that is the best bbq outside of Texas. So I tried it and it's fantastic. They've got great food with some killer sides needless to say they immediately got put in my rotation of places we go. I usually go with the brisket But there's chicken as well as ribs among their main items
,,,,,"Always the best. I have little to add to what's been published about this wonderful bbq joint. Always voted the best bbq in Chicago area. Go there,you will never be disappointed."
,,,,,After a day at the Navy Pier we were looking for a bbq place with available parking and we are so glad we found this place.
,,,,,"We were greeted as soon as we walked in, handed a menu, told to order at the cashier, asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating and after placing our order we were shown to a table."
,,,,,"I ordered the sliced brisket platter, added French fries & brisket chili, comes with coleslaw. The brisket was fork tender, Smokey and so delicious. The chili was loaded with meat, we all thought the fries were perfect and sauces were delicious and complemented the meals perfectly."
,,,,,"My daughter had chopped brisket, equally delicious .. she added Mac & cheese and said it was good."
,,,,,My son added cornbread to his order and he said it was delicious. 
,,,,,"The have salmon, ribs, chicken, pulled pork.. and plenty of sides and desserts. Plenty of indoor & outdoor seating. "
,,,,,"The staff was friendly and efficient, they cleared trays and were cleaning tables and keeping people happy. I wish I lived close by.. I would definitely recommend this place and will return if my son stays in Great Lakes."
,,,,,"The food here remains top notch, and they have been running a hyper efficient curbside pickup service during our Love in the Time of COVID-19 saga. Get the Toast app and place an order for now or reserve a specific time. Extremely well done"
,,,,,"The brisket here is excellent, the best I've had outside of Texas.  The ribs are pretty good as well, but you should really get the brisket.  Trust me, I'm a doctor.  (Full disclosure: I am not a doctor)"
,,,,,"In any event, do me a favor and decide before you show up - too many people dilly dally while in line and have no idea what they want when they arrive at the register.  That, more than anything else, contributes to the long lines here.  Come on, people, its barbeque!  These are not hard decisions."
,,,,,"PS, Hooray for BYOB."
,,,,,Amazing every single time I visit.   My brother drives over an hour just for the ribs.   The Mac is my personal fav.   Prepare to return if you visit.
,,,,,Food was great! Love going here when craving BBQ! Not to mention the great smoky smell outside as you drive by. Try it out!
,,,,,just not the same as a few years ago. peach cobler specially. The meats are not seasoned lile before just not the same. I lile  City bbq better.
,,,,,"Great BBQ !!! On the outskirts of Chicago, you would wanna stop here to get some great BBQ! Staff was sweet, gave us recommendations and were really sweet when it came to serving our food and sitting us. Very humble and very sweet! Service was quick and we I guess beat the rush hour line that was our the door by the time we got to the front ! "
,,,,,My favorite:
,,,,,Pulled pork
,,,,,Mac and cheese
,,,,,Baked beans
,,,,,Cole slaw
,,,,,"Not the biggest fan of the ribs, alot of fat which I personally don't like but I know many people do! "
,,,,,They give you two types of sauces ! One was very vinegary and the other taste more like the authentic BBQ sauce. I personally like the authentic BBQ taste !
,,,,,BIG TIP: SHARE ! It's MASSIVE LOL!
,,,,,Great spot! The take out / curbside pickup service was impeccable and they make sure you get all your items. Food was great; the chopped brisket was very moist and smoky. The ribs were smokey too. I love that they had 3 different types of sauces that all had some sweetness to it. A must-have for any Chicagoan who enjoys BBQ. A+! Mission accomplished.
,,,,,We curbside pick uped the BBQ that we ordered last night.
,,,,,"Two combination of BBQ and half a smoked chicken cost only around$30.0, very reasonable."
,,,,,BBQ was really smoky and nice flavored.Not salty and really tasty.

,,,,,"Solid Chicago barbecue! Meats were good- the brisket was nice and tender and paired very well with the sauces. Sides were so-so, not horrible nor were they fantastic. I recommend Smoque!"
,,,,,"Smoque is so , so delicious and was a huge hit for a smaller party at my home. Beyond literally EVERY person raving and then begging for leftovers - the people at Smoque are simply wonderful to work with. From helping me make good selections in appropriate amounts, to suggestions for serving and then down to delivery - top notch and wonderful! I had to cancel a previous order as the party date had to cancel at the last minute and they worked diligently and stayed in communication while my credit card was refunded. Just a well run organization with amazing people and food!"
,,,,,"Went a little after the lunch rush, got a parking spot in their lot and was able to sit outside underneath the tent! Great food, great staff!"
,,,,,So I expected deliciousness for the price $70.00
,,,,,"Two full slab dinners....  Mac with no flavor, cole slaw with light dressing, brisket chili with no salt , baked beans that taste expired. "
,,,,,"The ribs were tough...the portions are small, I think it's ridiculous. I don't mine paying for ""good food!"" Plus $4.50 if you pay by card. "
,,,,,I really expected more.
,,,,,I've been coming to Smoque for years . Always a smiling staff and Amazing barbecue.  Even now with the pandemic you can place your order and pull up right outside the kitchen and they are their to help you get on your way . Not sure who owns or manages the place ... But you ROCK !!!  Great customer service starts at the top.
,,,,,"Yeahhhhh, moist juicy BBQ and Chicken! "
,,,,,Yeahhhh
,,,,,I can't even say the BBQ here is even OK. There's hardly any smoke flavor and the brisket was so dry. Had trouble finishing it.
,,,,,"Temp checks, heated outdoor patio, and food dropped to your table service. Food and sauces were good."
,,,,,"Everything was good, but I did not realize how fatty bbq brisket was going to be! While I think the cut was a little too fatty for my taste, the flavor was on point. The brisket chili side was actually my favorite. I'd order that again."
,,,,,"Wow. This place is by far the best bbq I've ever eaten. I have yet to try Texas bbq but coming from LA, this place is so heavenly. The line was short on a Tuesday during lunch so it moved pretty quickly. After ordering, they pretty much seat you at a table. My cousin&I shared the sliced brisket plate with 2 sides so we got bbq beans, mac n cheese&she tried their cornbread."
,,,,,Food came out pretty quick. Everything smelled so delicious. Their brisket was juicy and melted like butter in your mouth. I was able to break it up with my fork but also kept breaking apart when I would try to pick it up. Dont be fooled by the burnt char on the outside of the brisket. You cant taste the bitterness of it. I am very skeptical when it comes to burnt food cause I hate the bitter taste but it was so good. Their bbq beans were sweet yet you taste that bbq char taste. Their slaw was crisp and had a great fresh crunch to them. Their slaw sauce is more tangy than usual slaw which is sweet but it's still good. Their mac n cheese was also great. It came out hot and baked with panko or crouton crust that was sprinkled on top. It kind of tasted dry to me but i like my mac n cheese very goopey and stringing with cheese.
,,,,,"Overall, this place was amazing. Everyone was friendly and had kindly given us some suggestions. They come by and grab your platter from you. I will definitely be dreaming of this place"

,,,,,Love how they have the outside setup.  Had wonderful brisket.  Both regular and chopped. The 2 sauces they provided were perfect.  Didnt over power the flavor of the brisket.  Baby rack ribs fell off the bone and were amazing.   Side of Mac n cheese w bread crumb crust.. yummy.
,,,,,Great service.  This was not the first trip and will be back again.
,,,,,Great BBQ and service!! My favorite was the BBQ half chicken. Done to perfection. I love their drive up service for those picking up on the go.
,,,,,"We have ordered carry out from here several times and it is seriously delicious in every way!  Last night I got the half chicken, Mac and cheese, slaw, chili and a corn muffin and I ate it all.  The chicken melts in your mouth, is moist, perfectly seasoned and smoked.  They give a sauce but it doesn't even need it, but the sauce is outstanding.  The Mac and cheese was the baked kind but was still creamy without the clumping that sometimes happens when it is baked to long or dried out.  The slaw was excellent with a nice kick of vinegar and spice and the corn muffin was really really awesome, nice and moist and a good density.  Such an amazing, solid meal with really good consistency every single time!  Amazing!"
,,,,,Some of the best BBW Chicago has to offer. My personal favorite is the pulled pork. Service is fast. No frills but food is good!
,,,,,"Smoque BBQ is our go to place. We have always done pick up even before the pandemic. They have a great set up for pick up now, bringing your order out to your car for a low contact pick up from masked employees. "
,,,,,"About the food- amazing BBQ pork, slaw, Mac & Cheese, bbq beans & cornbread muffins. A serving enough for lunch the next day. "
,,,,,If you haven't tried it- order. You won't be disappointed and I bet you'll go back.
,,,,,"It is a very simple place, clean, and small. However, the taste is phenomenal. It is worth freezing in line for. Amazing how they handle the mass amount of people."
,,,,,Updated review:
,,,,,Smoque remains the besst bbq in the city. Their customer service hasn't changed and it's always packed inside. You order and pay up front and then wait for a table to open up and then they sit you. 
,,,,,"I ordered their ribs again, while my wife ordered their brisket sandwich and my son ordered his kids meal brisket sandwich. Both sandwiches were packed full of meat. My wife ordered their bbq beans while I ordered their brisket chilli. I would have to say their bbq beans tasted a lot better. They were sweeter and completed the rest of the meal a lot better. The brisket was so tender and perfeclty smoked. The meat just literally fell apart. The ribs were also perfect smoked and seasoned. Only thing I'm really not a big fan of is their cole slaw. Needs more flavor. "
,,,,,"If you haven't tried smoque yet, what are you waiting for? I've had plenty of bbq and no one rivals Smoque!"
,,,,,"Smoque has without a doubt some of the best BBQ in the city. Their staff is very friendly, you order at the counter and they'll take it to your table. They will also not let you throw away your trash. They absolutely won't! The food is also very fairly priced. "
,,,,,"Now onto the best part, their food! I ordered a half slab of their St. Louis style ribs. It's got a delicious smoked flavor  and an excellent dry rub. You pour some of their Memphis style BBQ sauce on those babys and that's all she wrote. I ordered their BBQ beans and mac & cheese for my sides and my hole meal was absolutely fantastic. Smoque will definitely be my go to spot for BBQ."
,,,,,*3.5 stars
,,,,,"Always on an online list of Chicago restaurant recommendations. Does it live up to that hype? For me personally, no but not terrible."
,,,,,"The brisket is the most famous but mine were dry. A few slices had more fat in them which made them tasty but without the fat, the meat itself was dry. I didn't try the BBQ sauces but the brisket didn't taste like it can stand on its own."
,,,,,Ribs were okay. Meat was tender. Surface too charred.
,,,,,"Fries, cornbread, and coleslaw solid. Friendly service and food comes out quickly. Decent amount of tables but it can get super packed."
,,,,,"This is hands down the best rib place in Chicago land . We only order from here . We love everything ! The ribs , brisket , chicken , turkey . Sausage etc. the side are also so good ! The corn bread is to die for . The Mac and cheese is my sons favorite. The bbq sauce is so good they have regular and spicy .  We like spicy and this one has a kick . We live about 45 minutes away so when we go we order enough for 2 days . Just writing this review is making me drool . Yumm!"
,,,,,"Good food, great staff! I'll be back here for their ribs and sides! Parking is a little tricky to find."

,,,,,"This was my second time going to smoque, and just like the first time the food was awesome! I had the chopped brisket sandwich which came with a couple different sauces to try."
,,,,,I also had a side of macaroni and cheese which came in its own individual container with a crispy bread crumb crust on top. 
,,,,,As of June 18 they were still only serving food for carry out or they had outdoor seating.
,,,,,The staff was extremely friendly and prompt and getting our food out. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for barbecue in Chicago!
,,,,,Love this place came thru for an order as we were in the area. They offered us a menu and told us to call in our order. 
,,,,,"After a bit of a wait in the orange cone area we were brought our meal of pulled pork, buns, slaw, Mac n cheese, and brisket beans! "
,,,,,All people were wearing masks and were very patient with us as a drive up order. 
,,,,,"Wish we lived closer, but so happy to have bbq on this hot hot night in the city."
,,,,,"So me bring new to IL, a close friend got take away for us to enjoy Saturday."
,,,,,The brisket is as good as I have had in Texas!
,,,,,The pulled pork is done just right!
,,,,,Ribs are delicious! That's the meat covered!
,,,,,But I want to point out the sides.... 
,,,,,the beans with brisket were honestly some of the best I have had! 
,,,,,"Who cares about coleslaw? Well I do now! It was the  outstanding .... it wasn't just chopped up, squirt of mayo. This was zesty and tart, plenty of vinegar and pepper, it was perfection!"
,,,,,"I'm not allowed much bread, but those rolls..... I would fight any man shirtless to find better!"
,,,,,"My kids loved it! I loved it, and there's enough sauce left over, I might just put it all over the wife it's that good!"
,,,,,Highly recommend! 
,,,,,Full stars for you fine people! Happy to praise you as it was excellent.
,,,,,"Just so you know I lived in the South and I love BBQ, and you are right up there in my top 5."
,,,,,"BEST bbq in Chicago! Nothing comes close to it and what I love most about this place is that you get the whole package - brisket, fries, mac and cheese, corn bread, variety of sauces and peppers, dessert. Each and every item is worth ordering. Could eat this weekly - too bad they aren't closer to me!"
,,,,,"Smoque BBQ is one of tbose classic bbq joints where they offer beef brisket, bbq chicken, and all those amazing sides."
,,,,,I love their Beef Brisket here so much along with the variety of barbecue sauces they offer on the side. I enjoyed their bake beans alot. Service here is fast and prompt and very friendly once you enter the door!
,,,,,"Parking maybe difficult at times when crowded, but it really is a treat that you must try!"
,,,,,I've been going to smoke for years. Every single meal there has been consistent fresh heart and delicious. They're always extremely busy but the people that work there are always very good with handling the crowd. They always keep everybody calm and there happens to be a long wait which is well worth it. Are usually get the brisket pulled pork or the ribs. They are all equally delicious. Their mac & cheese side is awesome as is the peach cobbler. They give you a nice choice of sauces on the side and they are not chin see what their french fries. When you get an order to go it is packed very well hot and is always right with no mistakes. They have a very good system now especially with pick up they have people waiting outside you give them your order number just pull up in a marked off area and they will bring your food right out to you. One of the best barbecue places around. You have to go in and try the food especially if you love barbecue. I can go through the menu item by item but it won't do it justice you have to go in and experience it yourself you won't be disappointed go in there and enjoy or bring it home and enjoy thank you for reading.
,,,,,"I found Smoque via a DoorDash search, and then researched them on Yelp!  The reviews sounded great, so we decided to give it a try."
,,,,,"Overall, a strong 4, but with some notable exceptions.  Here's a breakdown:"
,,,,,"Mac n Cheese - 5 - Crusty, creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Individually baked in its own little tin bowl with bread crumbs on top."
,,,,,"Cornbread - 5 - Soft, slightly sweet, and delicious.  Also individually baked in its own little bowl like the mac n cheese.  One of ours was missing when the order arrived -- I'll mention more about that below."
,,,,,"BBQ Gumbo - 5 - This is the jewel in their crown.  It was oh, SO delicious, and so meaty and thick, full of brisket and andouille.  And it was not too spicy, but had just a little kick.  It was listed as a special, but I hope it's always available.  If not, it should be!  Hopefully my next order can be this, a la carte, with cornbread and mac n cheese.  Yum!"
,,,,,"Texas Sausage - 4 - Nicely grilled.  Quite spicy, but this was easily cut by alternating each bite with some coleslaw."
,,,,,BBQ Beans - 4 - My husband liked them and gave them a 4.
,,,,,"Ribs - 3 - Nice dry rub, easy off the bone, but nothing special. Normally, based on the rub and the flavor, I'd give them a 4.  But my half slab included the rib tips, which should have been trimmed off.  The bones in what I received were only about an inch long, and the rib tips (with cartilage) comprised the rest of the length. They were average in meatiness, again, nothing special.  For $20.25 with sides, I was expecting more. My husband's full slab was fine."
,,,,,"Coleslaw - 3 - I prefer creamy, and dislike vinegar-based.  This was somewhere in between.  It was okay.  It helped mitigate the spiciness of the sausage, so for that I was grateful, but by itself it was very plain, almost like naked shredded cabbage."
,,,,,"Sauce - 3 - It was a little too ""Carolina"" (tart and mustardy) for my taste.  I prefer smoky with a touch of sweet.  I'm not sure if they have other kinds, but I'll add that as a request the next time we order meats."
,,,,,"Our order arrived with only one cornbread, when we should have had two.  At first I thought we were missing the mac n cheese, as both of these sides come in the same type of small foil bowl, wrapped in more foil, so this is what I reported to DoorDash, and they immediately issued a generous credit.  "
,,,,,"Once we fully unwrapped everything, I realized it was really the second cornbread that was missing and not the mac n cheese, so I notified DoorDash of the correction.  They said they'd follow up with the restaurant, so hopefully they've done that by now."
,,,,,"Correct orders, especially during the pandemic when we're all essentially homebound and counting on the accuracy of the delivery, are super-important.  I considered dropping them down a star for this, but since we did get one of them cornbreads, so were able to cut it in half and both sample it, I left the rating alone."
,,,,,"Wow. Wow. Wow! First time trying Smoque BBQ and it was AMAZING! If I could have it everyday, I would. Everything we ordered was delicious! Brisket, mac and cheese, chili, fries, banana pudding. Heavenly!"
,,,,,"The brisket was tender and the top crust was my favorite! Definitely get the brisket! You also get an option to get it sliced or chopped. BBQ sauces were good! The Memphis bbq sauce was my favorite, followed by the spicy Memphis sauce."
,,,,,"The sides were all perfect as well, but the banana pudding is a must!"
,,,,,"One thing to note, which was a completely game changer: GET THE JALAPEÑOS! They're candied pickled jalapeños! There's a hint of spicy and then sweetness. Sooooo good to eat them with the brisket."
,,,,,Cannot wait to try the ribs next!
,,,,,No doubt this place is very good barbecue flavor food. The only thing I would recommend is for the restaurant to do better on the wait time.
,,,,,"Every time I think of their brisket, my mouth starts watering. They're usually pretty busy yet the food stays fresh and the service is fast. My go-to BBQ place in the city!"

,,,,,So we rushed here via bicycle from the Navy Pier and Wrigley Field. 
,,,,,"When we arrived at 8:04pm, we were told it was closed. On this site it says 9pm and when I called earlier in the day one of the employees said 9. Needless to say, my wife wasn't happy. "
,,,,,"The nice employee got the manager, we later found out it was Mike who is one of the owners. "
,,,,,"Mike came outside and we explained what had happened. He first offered us a gift card which we politely declined because we didn't live here and we still wanted to pay for our meal. The 14 miles of biking we did today, we were earning our meal lol!!! "
,,,,,So Mike said hold on let me see what I can do. Mike walked out 10 minutes later with a bag in hand. In the bad we're 2 brisket sandwiches and 2 bake beans along with 2 sausage. We asked Mike how much we owed. He wouldn't let us pay. We said no we insist. This went on for a minute or so. 
,,,,,We finally agreed to take the food from him. But I made Mike take a picture. This is when we found out he was the owner. 
,,,,,I ate the brisket sandwich. The bun was very soft and tasty. The brisket thankfully was not dried out or tough. A lot of briskets are. It had the burnt outside crust still on the pieces. They gave us 2 different sauces. One was Memphis and one was Carolina. The Carolina was vinegary and had some kick to it. I preferred the Memphis. 
,,,,,The sausage was good also not dry. Had a kick to it at the end. The beans we're good. They I believe we're cooked in the Carolina Bbq sauce or something that resembles it? It had a kick to it as well but had big chunks of pork or beef in the beans. I believe pork but I couldn't tell because i was almost finished already with my food lol!!
,,,,,"Overall very good bbq. Not dry, tasty and good size portions. We would come back for sure. "
,,,,,Thanks Mike!!!
,,,,,"Great BBQ! Good meat, yummy sides, and great sauces. I'd highly recommend the brisket!"
,,,,,"We got two platters and dessert so I got to try a bit of everything. For meat I'd definitely recommend the brisket, it was very tender and flavorful. I also tried the pulled pork but wasn't as impressed since it seemed a bit dry. "
,,,,,"For sides we got mac and cheese, brisket chili, bbq beans, and coleslaw. All the sides were good so you can't go wrong there! My personal favorite was the brisket chili (I really like the brisket if you couldn't tell lol). And for dessert we got the peach cobbler and pecan bread pudding. Both were very good, but between the two I'd choose the pecan bread budding. Overall a delicious meal!"
,,,,,I really don't like it because it wasn't that great! It has not the favor of the smoke bar- be-que  I was looking for. In order for pork to really be tender it should be slow cooked. I know of a person who really can smoke pork . Then he later add barbecue sauce of his making himself. So I can not eat food with no taste! I love barbecue with taste. You know it is good without the sauce.
,,,,,Smoked Meats
,,,,,By far some of the best brisket I've had outside of my own smoker. Sides are very flavorful as well.
,,,,,"Amazingly delicious bbq! We stoppped by, ordered through a window and was able to sit at their outdoor seating area! There is a lot of room and it was so nice to be able to have space heaters to help keep us warm! Smoque is doing a fantatstic job taking COVID precautions as well!"
,,,,,"My favorite part of the meal (besides the delicious pulled pork) was their mac and cheese! It was a perfect blend between cheesey and baked. I am craving it right now while thinking about it! They only have it as a side, but I would purchase a bowl!"
,,,,,"Though the food is a bit pricey, the portions are huge and is great to share a meal with someone else or have left overs (though you won't want to)!"
,,,,,Can't wait to order it again!
,,,,,"Hands down the best BBQ in Chicago. We are fortunate to have this in our neighborhood but regardless it is worth the drive if you are in another part of the city. Excellent and flavorful BBQ and my favorite... the sides. The sides are delicious and I could honestly eat a whole meal of just those! The Mac & cheese, cornbread, and slaw are out of this world. Craving some good quality bbq? This is your place!"
,,,,,"I found this place on Yelp. I was looking for barbecue for a catering order for my birthday. I wanted to try it because they had so many  reviews. Customer service was excellent, and the food was delicious. I highly recommend. My guest absolutely loved it. My boyfriend and I plan to dine in try more options"
,,,,,Meats-
,,,,,Full platter of Brisket: 5+  (tender and juicy meat)
,,,,,"Full slab of ribs: 4 (they are chew-off-the-bone type of ribs, rather than the fall-off-the-bone style that I prefer. Still good!)"
,,,,,"Cole slaw: 5+  (vinegar-based, and SO good and light!)"
,,,,,Mac n Cheese: 5
,,,,,Cornbread: 3 
,,,,,Baked beans: 4
,,,,,Fries: 4
,,,,,Service: 5 
,,,,,"They are well-organized to accommodate a lot of hungry, bbq-goers. We pulled up tonight, and there was a line of cars along the side of the store, where people picked up their phone/mobile orders. The staff members  outdoors were ready to deliver the orders to people waiting, requesting their order #. If you do not purchase in advance, you can pull up ahead of the lined cars waiting to collect their orders, and order at the side window where a large menu is on display. We placed our order that moment, and our food was ready in about 12 minutes or so.  "
,,,,,We'll venture back...
,,,,,I am a huge fan of this place and I'm glad they're still going during the pandemic. 
,,,,,"I've been about a half dozen times in recent years, switching between the meal options and the a la carte to see what works out best because it's a ton of food. The corn bread and Mac and cheese are great, and I remember the fries being exactly the right kind of seasoned."
,,,,,The brisket has always been my favorite but really I don't remember getting a single bad thing there.
,,,,,"This place only does outdoor dining for the time being. My husband and I went here for the first time for dinner because we will be moving to the area in a few days. It was delicious and the weather was nice, so we had an enjoyable experience. Something to note, we were obviously having a brain fart because we thought the mac and cheese was the cornbread, but it just looked super similar. Regardless, the host Henry was super helpful with helping us and even after we realized our mistake, they still let us keep the extra mac (so sorry!). Truly though, everyone working was so involved, friendly and efficient. You don't really see that nowadays, especially with working outside. We are excited to keep on going here.  "
,,,,,"Also, BYOB! Someone even cut up our lime for us to have with our captain and cokes. That's fantastic service!"
,,,,,So happy with our visit!
,,,,,Definitely go here to satisfy your BBQ cravings!

,,,,,This was my first time trying this restaurant but it will not be my last. Not only is the food is delicious but they have outstanding customer service! The gumbo and the ribs were delicious!!!
,,,,,It's where I go for bbq brisket! The sauces are delicious. Try it and you won't be disappointed! I highly recommend
,,,,,Smoque has been on my radar for a while after coming highly recommended from friends and coworkers. 
,,,,,"I placed my order online and picked up at their walk up station, and my order took about 20 minutes to be ready. They don't accept cash, only card at the window. "
,,,,,"I ordered the pulled pork platter with cole slaw, mac & cheese, and baked beans, a Texas sausage, 1/4 ribs, and brisket. I really do love and appreciate that you can order sides of meat and not commit to ordering meat by the 1/2 or whole pound. "
,,,,,"First off the food is really amazing and delicious! The brisket was so moist and fatty and filled with flavor. I didn't need to use the BBQ sauce at all. The pulled pork was good with Carolina sauce, the ribs were tender and flavorful. I'm usually not a fan of coleslaw, but Smoque's is pretty good. The cabbage is freshly shaved with slivers of purple onion. They also don't use the traditional heavy coleslaw dressing, but a fresh and light vinaigrette situation. The baked beans are creamy and filled with meat. The mac & cheese was nice with a breadcrumb topping, but was quite small, I want to say like 4 oz. "
,,,,,They do make sure that your food doesn't spill in transport since to go containers are lined with foil and each item is in a brown bag. 
,,,,,"Overall, everything I ordered was delicious and I can't wait to come back and try their chicken as well as the peach cobbler. I also need to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauces!"
,,,,,It's my personal smoked food joint in Chicago. Ribs always good. And your plain old dumb if you don't grab the peach cobbler.
,,,,,"The bbq is above average, but not worth the price you'd pay for a restaurant.  A pulled pork meal is $19.  A few years ago it was a 1/3 less and the same food.  "
,,,,,They should really try changing up the menu or recipes.   I've tried many of the other places around Chicago and competition getting as good.
,,,,,"I love this place!!!  I saw this resturant/dinner on Food network and found it to be interesting.  Apparently these guys went around the counrty and found BBQ that was good, then they brought it back to Chicago.  I've had Texas BBQ and it's pretty much the same, but they have more types of BBQ."
,,,,,"I think there BBQ is a little spicy, which I love.  Plus the sides are pretty tasty."
,,,,,"Only waring is watch out for a long wait, since it's not that big."
,,,,,"Yum yum and YUMMM! Great food, great portions, friendly and professional staff. Everything on the menu is delicious! Love this place!"
,,,,,One of my favorite places. Kid friendly & perfect  for day drinking (kids optional). Best BBQ in this hood.
,,,,,Been coming here since I was 12 years old. ALWAYS hits the spot. Irving park gem! Best BBQ on the north side for sure.
,,,,,"Here comes a Yelp cliché... I can't believe I never wrote a review for Smoque BBQ. Years ago I lived a few blocks away and would order at least twice a month. That was probably my introduction to competition style BBQ. I'm a proud Southsider and grew up eating from the aquarium smokers found at the legendary Lem's. Although I'm partial to Lem's and that style, I still appreciate and enjoy competition BBQ."
,,,,,"Smoque had a respectable run the best in Chicago for a while. ..until Green Street Smoked Meats hit the scene. Smoque is still top 3 for this style. Their best menu item is the brisket. It's incredibly moist with beautiful bark. The pork ribs are also tender and seasoned in a way that doesn't overpower the pork. Many BBQ joints apply too much rub and sauce. That reduces the ribs to being a vehicle for brown sugar, salt, spice and sauce."
,,,,,"They offer baby back and spare ribs. Go for the spare ribs. ..no discernible difference in flavor or texture, but they're meatier. "
,,,,,Other random thoughts. ..he mac and cheese is above average. ..the brisket beans are very smokey. ..fries are fresh cut. .. chicken is delicious and the service has always been friendly. If you prefer a sweet flavor profile Smoque isn't for you. Otherwise I'd say they're worth a special trip if you're on the Northside.
,,,,,Excellent brisket one of the best places in town for the intense flavor so fresh and delicious I love the brisket sandwich which also comes with the sauces that are so good with the meat
,,,,,3800 N Pulaski Rd
,,,,,Ste 2
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60641"
,,,,,"I always love the dry rub on the bark of the ribs, it's flavorful with just a hint of sweet that I rarely ever need the Barbeque sauce that comes with it. The ribs are well smoked, the Mac and cheese is always delish, I like the minimalism of the German style coleslaw and I often buy both the the peach cobbler and bread pudding together. Smoque is a neighborhood favorite for me."
,,,,,"I ordered takeout from Smoque as I had a craving for brisket, and this place is the spot to get it (have already been here numerous times, never disappoints). I got a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich for my wife, as she vastly prefers that to the brisket. When we got home, we found that we had received two brisket sandwiches instead of one being a pulled pork. Not a big deal, and called back to explain the situation to see what could be done to correct it."
,,,,,"Maria helped me out with this, and was not only extremely helpful and kind, but also made sure that I was taken care of for the error. It is service like this along with the quality and taste of their food that makes this place the best BBQ spot in the city. I know this is not so much a review of the food, which is worth the calories and trip here everytime, but wanted to give feedback on the exceptional service provided by the staff, especially Maria!"
,,,,,"This is a no frills BBQ joint that is there to do one thing, and it is to deliver to your taste buds the best BBQ this side of the Midwest. Any BBQ place worth its salt does one thing right, and that is the brisket. Smoque absolutely does not disappoint in this regard. It is juicy, tender, and practically melts in your mouth with each bite. The ribs are also great, as is the Mac N Cheese and BBQ chicken. If you are craving or missing some southern BBQ, Smoque will fill that void."
,,,,,Brisket is fabUlous! 
,,,,,Patio is open only right now- but easy ordering and delivery to patio. 
,,,,,Staff is friendly and food comes out quickly. 
,,,,,Two types of sauces are served with orders. 
,,,,,Pulled pork is good- but the brisket is outstanding.
,,,,,By far best barbecue joints in the land I had smoked ribs and chicken and it is exactly how my uncle God rest his soul used to barbecue every time I come here I just get a lot of memories because the food is just so great
,,,,,"Just came back from a trip in St. Louis. Wanted to see if Chicago BBQ stacks up against the south. I can tell you that the ribs are on par, if not even better, than the southern smokehouse."
,,,,,"While the ribs aren't nearly as ""fall off the bones"", the texture and flavor are to my liking and preference. The sides are so so. Give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed."
,,,,,"We go out of our way to go to Smoque when in Chicago. We are picky with barbecue- especially with brisket- and Smoque always hits the spot.  High quality ingredients, amazing flavor, tender meat, solid sides... it's worth going out of the way for.  Definitely the best brisket in the Midwest. Parking can be a challenge, but we make the trek anyway."
,,,,,"I love Smoque's BBQ. I seldom eat pork, except on occasion, like B-Day, (which is why I went) holiday days or vacation. I live in the south suburbs of Chicago but will travel for Smoque's , yes it's that good. What's good, Bbq, corn bread , & mac-n- cheese, oh & the coleslaw. I had the fries once some years ago, but it was a lot so I don't order them. I ordered a whole slab, the other half is in my freezer. I love the cornbread & mac in their own tinfoil container, I also ordered some to take home as well. I went for lunch on a weekday & it was not crowded, surprisingly, so I enjoyed eating inside. Last year I ordered to go because of COVID."
,,,,,Portions are too small  for the prices. Food is good  and always on point. Briskett is proper and so are ribs and sausage. sides are decent. i never feel like the price is right for so little food.
,,,,,"Had my boyfriend do take out from this place, the brisket was a little dry but the Mac & cheese & cornbread made up for it ."
,,,,,"OMG their food is just wicked delicious. I recommend the gumbo, the brisket, the corn bread. Haven't had a bad meal there ever, based on about a dozen visits. They handle curbside pickup really nicely and their online ordering and payment is pretty easy to use.  YUM!"

,,,,,"The BBQ here is outstanding! I'm a fan of the pulled pork bcuz it's just so tender and juicy! You have to get the cornbread and Mac & Cheese, you won't be disappointed. My mouth is literally watering as I write this lol"
,,,,,"I don't think this place ever has a slow night. Taste the food and you'll know why packed tables are the norm. Everything is delicious. The brisket, pulled pork sandwich and brisket chili are my favorites. Heads up, the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler come in smaller portions than most Americans are used to. I'm usually so full that anything larger than the peach cobbler would be too much."
,,,,,"Despite being ranked among the top BBQ spots in Chicago, this place is nothing special. It's decent, but mediocre at best."
,,,,,"Also be aware, Smoque BBQ is one of the few spots in town that still haven't opened up their indoor dining rooms yet. You will have to eat outside in their tent setup with no air conditioning. There is no waiter, you order your food at the cashier table and they bring it to you in a grocery basket."
,,,,,"We ordered the baby-back ribs, brisket, cornbread, and a couple of other side dishes. "
,,,,,"Only the brisket was above a 6/10. It's just how you want it, tender, fatty, flavorful. A solid 7.5 to 8/10. If you're coming to Smoque BBQ, definitely order the brisket here. Another item worth your while is the mac-n-cheese. It's got a nice creamy texture that packs flavor."
,,,,,"For a popular BBQ spot, you'd expect some kickass baby back ribs but the ones here were surprisingly dry and lacked that BBQ flavor. "
,,,,,"Everything else: the cornbread, beans, coleslaw, and fries were just ok. The side dishes tasted just how u would expect them too. Maybe a bit on the more boring side."
,,,,,Overall Smoque BBQ is ok but don't have high expectations. 
,,,,,Score: 6.1/10
,,,,,Maybe I went on an off day or too early in the morning but the bbq felt a little bit dry. I tried the brisket ribs sausage and gumbo. The brisket was good but unfortunately the rib was no fall of the bone as I expected. I liked that the restaurant provided 2 different sauces a tangy one and a robust sweet one. I like the tangy South Carolina style bbq.
,,,,,Brisket sandwich was good but how in the hell do they charge almost $19.00 for a sandwich and fries no drink. No wonder the place was empty I will never go back
,,,,,Brisket (5/5): undisputed star of the show. Melt-in-your-mouth tender.
,,,,,Mac-n-cheese (5/5): classic mac only made more divine with panko 
,,,,,"St. Louis Ribs (3/5): dry, not very tender, difficult to separate"
,,,,,"Fries (4/5): solid fries on the softer side, but could come across as fresher"
,,,,,Someone surprised my office with lunch from Smoque. The brisket was amazing as well as the mac and cheese. Everyone only had good things to say.
,,,,,"Cannot complain! On a couples vacation, we stopped in here after reading all the good reviews on here and recommendation from Guy Fieri. "
,,,,,"Between 2 of us, we ordered ribs, pulled pork, brisket, cornbread, mac n cheese, coleslaw and fries. Everything was delicious and portion sizes were perfect. Left with leftovers. "
,,,,,"They give you their 3 different sauces on the side and those were great as well. Their classic sauce, classic sauce with a kick (spicy) and a sauce with vinegar base."
,,,,,"And although they don't sell/have alcohol, they are byob. "
,,,,,The indoor area has about 15 tables and their outdoor area and to go windows constantly kept customer traffic flowing smoothly.
,,,,,Definitely worth a stop if you're in town. They have delivery options as well.
,,,,,"My first BBQ place in the Chicago area. It was completely impromptu decision to stop here for lunch. Parked like two blocks away at the edge of the neighborhood by the highway. They had their own parking lot but not sure if its open to customers. They also have a large designated area for curbside orders and pick up. Of note, no burnt ends on their menu, no cash, BYOB."
,,,,,"I got the rib combo to try both their baby back and St. Louis style ribs. Sides of coleslaw, mac and cheese, and cornbread. My gf got the pulled pork sandwich. Seating as under a big outdoor tent. You order and pay up front and seat yourself. Someone brings your food in a grocery basket. Someone is supposed to bring your drinks before that, but I think they forgot us and we didn't get our bottled water until after our food was delivered and asked for it even though other tables who sat down after us got their drinks first."
,,,,,"My gf really liked her sandwich. She said it was like a sweet Hawaiian type bun and it went better with the Memphis style sauce than the Carolina style sauce. I enjoyed my ribs. They were good and tasty, but the overall experience was just average."
,,,,,"My initial reaction on opening my box of food was: these were the smallest racks of ribs I have ever seen. Maybe typical for this area but feels like a terrible value for $30. I believe they gave two short ends of the rack, but they were not very meaty. The meat did came off the bone cleanly with a little bit of effort though. Only had one really fatty chunk. The ribs came with two Memphis sauce, no Carolina. I tried both and nothing special about either sauce so I just stuck with what was served. Mac was alright. Cornbread was flavorless. Coleslaw is made without mayo. I wasn't sure at first but it grew on me. Very refreshing."
,,,,,"Would be willing to try their brisket if I have another BBQ itch, but not before evaluating other options."
,,,,,"Doesnt like much when I started, but now i m in love with all wingstop flavors , i am addicted"

,,,,,A little but pricey and not a great selection but I hold a high standard for BBQ! This place has good food but menu is limited and it just doesn't have that down south authentic appeal to it
,,,,,We drove all the way up just to try this place as the ratings were incredible! 
,,,,,The biskets
,,,,,"Super tender, juicy and incredible soft + tasty! A must order and really great stuff that saved the rating! "
,,,,,Mac n cheese
,,,,,"It was rated incredibly well online and yes it was good but not outstandingly crazy! If you love Mac n cheese - go for it! If you have fomo because of the good ratings, still try it! For $4 you can't go wrong! "
,,,,,St. Louis ribs
,,,,,It was recommended. I've found no review that pointed out the different from the baby ribs. But the baby ribs were not available for half stack so we went for the St. Louis ones and we regretted it. The meat was a bit dry and the sauces were underwhelming. 
,,,,,Overall a good place where you can your food pretty fast at a reasonable price point with amazing brisket s.
,,,,,"My sis in-law had Thanksgiving dinner catered by Smoque and it was delicious! Pulled pork, smoked chicken, salad with ranch, mashed potatoes with gravy, it was all flavorful, and very good. Looking forward to dining at the restaurant, in the future. "
,,,,,"Btw, she said the ease of ordering and picking up were phenomenal, and the staff were friendly."
,,,,,My buddy and I decided to treat ourselves to BBQ and Smoque is one of the few BBQ joints that are still open in our area. 
,,,,,"I had the 1/2 order of sliced Brisket and my friend had the Brisket sandwich, Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. "
,,,,,We both enjoyed the comestibles!
,,,,,"We drive 40 to 60 minutes to come here and boy is it worth it. BBQ dinners sandwiches and sides plus dessert.  Try the sliced  or chopped brisket 1/2 chicken pulled pork and 2 style of ribs.  The fries coleslaw Mac n cheese are killer. Texas sausage, gumbo chili too.  Tacos on Tuesday are fantastic!  3 kinds of sauces the spicy Memphis is the best!  Go there with a big appetite the portions are great for the price"
,,,,,"Yummmm some of the best American BBQ I've ever had. Got full slab baby back ribs, brisket a la carte platter, and Texas sausage a la carte platter. Brisket was soooooo tender and had amazing smoked flavor wow. Baby back ribs were pretty good although I think I've had better elsewhere, but still worth it. Texas sausage surprised me bc I didn't think sausages would taste thaaaaaat good but it was so damn delicious??? My bf and I also agreed that their coleslaw is the best we've ever had. Mac and cheese was great too although it was smaller than I imagined."
,,,,,Was craving BBQ for a few weeks and checked this place as it was close to home....and I'M GLAD I DID!  Staff was friendly and quickly fulfilled and served us our order.  The servings were generous for the price and ribs were outstanding!
,,,,,"The BBQ was tasty. The sauce was average. The fries was good. The sausage was good. The food was ok. The staffs were very nice. The place had no waits, no lines. We walked right in and were seated. The food came put quite fast."
,,,,,"Simply the best - head and shoulders above the rest.  Outstanding B B Q Brisket.  But then again everything else is too.  Beans, cornbread, slaw and all the other Smoque meats made slowly and lovingly in that vast oven.  So much research and time went into the food served at this small but delectable restaurant and it shows from first taste to last."
,,,,,I love BBQ and this place is the best. The BBQ chicken is tender and freshly made. The sauces are fantastic. And it's BYOB. Always nice service too.

,,,,,"Split the burrito and kale salad for two for a quick lunch, both dishes were full of flavors and left us feeling both full and light"
,,,,,"I wanted this place to be good, but I was disappointed. "
,,,,,Since it was my first time I asked our server what were some of his recommendations. He recommended the Springy Shrimp and Pork Belly so that's what I got. We also ordered Fat Elvis Waffles and Goat Chili Cheese Fries.
,,,,,"Our appetizer (the cheese fries) were pretty good the first couple of bites but got very heavy towards the end. Then our entrees came, but it wasn't what I ordered. He gave me the Pork Belly Pancake instead of the Shrimp and Pork Belly. I had to wait 30min for him to come back because he kept disappearing and was chatting with other customers. He didn't even acknowledge that he got my order wrong and said he thought that's what I ordered originally. After another 25-35min my correct order came out. By now I am not even hungry anymore and was tired of waiting for decent service. "
,,,,,"My friend's Fat Elvis Waffles were pretty good though. My two dishes (even the mistake dish) was not good. The pork belly was so hard and dry. The Shrimp and Pork Belly dish was super salty too. If you come here make sure NOT to order any of the Asian fushion dishes. I had plenty of good Asian fusion dishes and this is NOT the place to order it. It's called a ""diner"" for a reason so stick with the breakfast/burger entrees."
,,,,,"I come to Little Goat whenever I want breakfast for dinner because their pancakes are so fluffy, flavorful, and filling. My friend and I have tried the sourdough pancakes, dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes, and the apple crumble pancakes, and I have loved them all. The servings are quite large and so we typically split a plate of pancakes and get a lighter side to supplement the meal. The chocolate pancakes are definitely for chocolate lovers and I find them to be a bit heavy unless I split them with a friend but the sourdough pancakes are so yummy and simple, and the apple crumble topping on apple pancakes is so well spiced. Apart from the pancakes, I have also tried the parathas burrito, and I found that the chili pepper sauce was way too tangy for my liking. I look forward to trying Little Goat's savory options in the future!"
,,,,,"Aside from the food, I love the decor at Little Goat. They have a photo booth in the waiting area and the booths are comfortable and spacious. "
,,,,,"Additionally, the service is incredible. All the waiters I have had have been pretty funny and very attentive to dietary restrictions. On my last visit, I accidentally left a small gift at the booth and didn't realize until I got home, but the restaurant put a really honest effort into finding it for me and then kept the gift safe until I could pick it up the next day."
,,,,,"Busy place, Good breakfast "
,,,,,"Went here for breakfast. Thanks to my son for choosing this.  I had the Smoked Cornbeef Hash with eggs. It was very flavorful.  Hubby had This Little Piggy went to China which he enjoyed. Another family member had the cinnamon roll which was big and looked sumptuous!  A well-run place. Service was good, waitress seemed no-nonsense with our group of six.  Parking can be a challenge. We used Lyft!  When I'm back in Chicago, I'd like to return because there's a lot of things on the menu that sound good!"
,,,,,4.5 stars 
,,,,,"First stop in Chicago! We had a late Friday bunch reservation with the place still buzzing full of happy customers. Our waitress, Joan, reminded me so much of Anna Kendrick; her smile lit up her whole face. She mentioned people have told her she resembles Julianne Moore. She stopped by our table at the right times asking if we needed anything else and made sure our glasses were full. "
,,,,,"Big portions! Prices aren't bad either. Tempura mashed potatoes! By golly this was my favorite thing to eat here and it's a side dish! Crunchy fried exterior and those clumpy potatoes resembling a mashed banana texture ... accompanied by an Asian slaw underneath. Two long slabs of sweet fat Elvis waffles, nice and crisp except for the parts smothered in maple syrup, crumbled bacon pieces, whipped peanut butter made the dish! Nothing can beat fresh banana slices on waffles. Only $13. I tried a bite of the Went to China: biscuit topped with chorizo, a fried egg, and blackberry sauce-- the flavor mix was spot on. Omelette of the day was Spring Thing with lots of spinach, crisp French onions on top. Didn't get to try any but my friend left the plate clean. "
,,,,,"So many restaurants with ""goat"" in their names in this area! I'd definitely recommend this place to newcomers. Staff is friendly, portions are bigger than expected, and it's a good way to become immersed in Chicago culture by people watching."
,,,,,"If I return one day, I'll get their notable bullseye French toast with strawberries & fried chicken pieces. Tempura mashed potatoes, I'll be back."
,,,,,"I came to visit the Midwest during the winter, and the very first spot I tried was this diner. It turned out to be a decision that I was grateful that I made. Upon walking in, the employees were very kind and eager to talk to me. Between my cousin and I, we ordered a total of 3 dishes that all turned out to be delightful. My only complaint is that the sauce in my dish was a little too salty, other than that we enjoyed everything. Next time I come to visit, I'll definitely stop by here again."
,,,,,"During a week visiting the Midwest, Little Goat provided me with my favorite meal.  Indeed, This Little Piggie Went to China may be the best thing I've eaten all year.  Little Goat gives you a low-key, informal, modern diner experience that's perfect whether you're dining as a couple or a large group of friends/family.  While some of the dishes step outside of the box, there are lots of classic, All-American dishes than even picky diners (or kids) will enjoy."
,,,,,THIS LITTLE PIGGIE WENT TO CHINA
,,,,,"I adore southern food and Chinese food.  This Little Piggie is the perfect marriage of both cuisines.  While it's listed as a breakfast food this is a dish that can (and should) be enjoyed at any meal.  Heat, salt, and acid are all here.  There sauce is tangy and the gooseberries are sweet.  The eggs and biscuit add a rich, unctuousness.  This is a dish that you don't want to miss.  Words really can't describe the perfect combination of flavors that you get here. "
,,,,,GRILLED CHEESE
,,,,,"This isn't the traditional Cheddar or American grilled cheese your mom made you or that you can get at Denny's.  This is a full meal in a rich, delectable sandwich.  The bread is a hearty bacon gouda and the filling has a mix of goat cheese, cheddar, and guanciale (cured pork jowl) and jam.  It's a great mix of savory, salty, and sweet."
,,,,,DRINKS
,,,,,"While the beer, wine, and cocktail lists aren't huge, Little Goat does offer a little of everything.  You can find a few local-ish beers (Goose Island, Bells), as well as some craft beer stalwarts (Allagash, Ballast Point) and even the Champagne of Beers (Miller High Life)."
,,,,,Omg!!! Absolute deliciousness!!! I had 
,,,,,"This little piggy went to China, it was an explosion in my mouth of delicious flavors! Will travel to Chicago from Miami again."
,,,,,I've been here multiple times over the past several years and I'm just kind of over it. I went again this weekend with my wife for Sunday brunch. The service is consistently mediocre. Our waitress couldn't have been more disinterested. Poor girl next to us got water spilled on her by a busser and I don't think anyone really apologized.
,,,,,It's always slammed though. I guess it's the brand name that draws everyone in. I would recommend trying all of Izard's other restaurants over the diner. I will admit the chocolate chip pancakes are amazing! SO GOOD. But the chicken and French toast kind of let me down this time - just tasted kind of weird. 
,,,,,"I'll keep coming back for the pancakes, otherwise there are so many better options in town."
,,,,,"1st review, 2nd visit to Stephanie Izard's Little Goat in the West Loop. Went for brunch with two friends around 9:30-9:45 on a Saturday morning. My half-asleep and disheveled self was rewarded by us getting seated immediately. Score. The wait was muuuuuuch longer by the time we finished eating."
,,,,,"Started off with their version of a cinnabon. It was really good and definitely big enough to share. For entrees we shared the double chocolate chip pancakes, the tasty Asian breakfast thingy and the french toast. The pancakes were great, perfect consistency and the right amount of chocolate. French toast was amazing and the friend chicken piled on top was perfectly crispy. The wild Asian breakfast plate was a fun combination of kimchi, pancakes, eggs and bacon. Lots of flavors but not overwhelming!"
,,,,,Little Goat has one of the more unique and creative brunch menus in Chicago. If not for really slow service throughout our entire meal I would have given it 5 stars. Would definitely go again!
,,,,,The Not Chinese Broccoli (AKA regular broccoli with szechuan vinaigrette. sesame. peanuts) was  perfectly charred  and tasty! (It was everything last nights mushy cauliflower at a different restaurant wasn't -- so much so that i told the server they redeemed charred veggies for me!)
,,,,,Pork belly and chive pancake (scallion pancake. house hoisin. bok choy salad. ginger maple dressing) was amazing - and huge portion with slaw and Asian crunchies over the top. Especially great at only $13!
,,,,,Flavors exploding in both meals in the best way!
,,,,,"Against my better judgement, i stuffed a small rhubarb-strawberry pie (literally an entire 6"" pie!) my pie-hole, and rolled myself back onto the El to go back to my hotel, totally stuffed and totally happy."
,,,,,Cute modern-Dine interior with a pleasant buzzy loudness
,,,,,My friendly waiter was unobtrusive but great bringing drink refills and clearing plates efficiently.
,,,,,"A very pleasant, delicious, fun place to eat!"
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,I've found Stephanie Izard's collection of restaurants to be must-visit establishments during every trip to Chicago.
,,,,,"The diner is bright and inviting, with attentive service. Settling on a brunch entree was a challenge before the This Little Piggy Went To China eventually won out. It couldn't have been better. I'm not sure which was my favorite part -- each layer was better than the last! -- though the biscuit was especially tasty."
,,,,,Prices are what you'd expect for the neighborhood-- and the dishes are well worth the expense.
,,,,,Can't wait to return on my next trip to Chicago.
,,,,,"Of Stephanie Izard's 3 popular spots in West Loop, this is by far the easiest to book a reservation at. We were promptly seated at our reservation time on a Sunday. The service was good, although not amazing, which is what I expected at a more casual diner."
,,,,,"I had the Almighty Goat burger, which is huge. No, really, it's humongous. As in you can't actually eat it like a burger because it won't fit in your mouth. It's delicious and will be more than enough to make you bloated, but you'll have to eat it with a fork and knife."
,,,,,My fiance had the Kimchi goat burger which she loved. I didn't taste it myself since I was busy with the Almighty Goat burger but she said it was very good.
,,,,,The other 2 at our table had the fish tostadas and Manicotti. Both were good. The fish tostadas was more food than expected. I did have a small taste of the fish and it was quite good.
,,,,,"Overall, it's not as good as Girl and the Goat but that's to be expected and it's a good casual diner place that gives generous portions of good food at a reasonable price."
,,,,,Loved this diner! We had just went to the Girl & the Goat across the street the night before for my birthday dinner. We woke up and decided to give the diner a try. We were a party of two on a Thursday afternoon and made reservations the day of about 2hrs before. To drink I had the Little goat latte which is made with goats milk and my boyfriend had the kimchi Bloody Mary (both recommended). We then ordered the veggie omelette and bi bim bop bowl with a side of cheesy grits and bacon. The bowl was good just a bit soupy on the bottom bc instead of rice it's cauliflower. Grits weren't my fav but I'm glad I gave them a go. Service was great and I'll def be back to try something more items.
,,,,,"Heard about this place and its sister restaurant a lot and had to know what the hype was about. Well, now I also love this place haha. Where to begin? The place itself was really charming and classy. They open as early as 7am so we were able snag a last min reservation on sunday morning at 830 am before the rush. We were about 15min late sadly so lost our table but we still got some counter seats! Waitress was really nice and helpful and the service was super fast considering how busy it was and became. Their system, which we observed from our counter seats facing the kitchen, seemed super efficient and the food always looked so amazing."
,,,,,"If you like thick yogurt I highly recommend the honey yogurt and granola (its nut free) to start with or on the side (but beware, it is quite filling). If you like the taste of goat cheese, I highly recommend the little goat latte. The goat milk they use made it taste slightly like goat cheese which I loved. I've never had anything like it before. Not too sweet of a latte either but a little rich (they top it with whipped cream)."
,,,,,We ended up ordering the everything is everything crumpets and smoked corned beef hash with over medium eggs. The hash was what I was craving and satisfied me but that dish as a whole was a little bland. A little bit of pepper and salt solved that though! The everything is everything is like a lox platter with the most amazing homemade sesame english muffins. They're super soft and buttery almost like a biscuit and were awesome with tzatziki spread and lox. A lot of pickled items on that plate too which I loved.
,,,,,Definitely coming back here again in the future!
,,,,,Been here a few times. Always great. i had a pork katsu sandwich last time and it was amazing. This is one of my go-to's for when family is in town. They have a great menu with a little bit for everyone.
,,,,,"Yikes. I will start off by saying I went to the Girl and the Goat the night before and had a 5 star experience. In our 3-day trip in Chicago, we decided to choose Little Goat for dinner as well. "
,,,,,There's a lot of what-ifs with this certain dining experience. We got sat by the kitchen and got to see a ton of delicious food come out. But what ruined the experience from the start was where we were sat. I was at the very end of the long table right by the opening (where all of the runners stood to wait). Totally not his fault but the runner was a little too close to the table (at times kind of hanging over the table near my food) which made me wish I could just be sat one seat over so he didn't bump into me.  
,,,,,"It was also a busy Saturday night and our server almost never made it down to our end. It took quite a long time before he introduced himself. Then after taking our order, disappeared for 30 minutes. Never came to check up on us after the runner gave us our food or to see if we needed more drinks. I wanted hot sauce but he never came and had to ask a random lady and even told her that we were having a problem getting our server. I knew something was immediately off after my first few bites of the Japchae burger. At one point I decided to take off all the toppings and saw the complete black charred burger. And of course since our server wasn't around, I just sat there waiting. My bf finished his entire meal while I took small bites of mines (I was starving) hoping to get the server. By the time he came, I wondered if I should even say anything because I had eaten a lot of the japchae and did not want him to think I was trying to get a free meal. But honestly the burger was burnt to a crisp. He immediately apologized and said he would take it off the bill and that was that. It was the only time we saw him. I would have ordered a different dish and paid for it but so much time had passed so we left. He was nice but we saw him continuously go the the other patrons at the other end of the table and it felt like being at a bar where you see everyone else get served and you desperately are trying to make eye contact to get some service."
,,,,,"Let me start by saying the service here was really stellar. We were never left waiting, and our server knew every answer to every question. She gave recommendations, and we never felt at all like a bother. We had a reservation for lunch, and it was packed, so we waited just a few minutes past our reservation.  During this time, we noticed that the place really could use a good spiffing up- the entryway was pretty dirty, the walls had some scuffs and marks, and the glass dividers between the guests were full of fingerprints. The thing is, it's really very well designed. Most concerningly, though, was the sunlight. It was pretty riddled with cracks, which I'm sure cause little structural threat, but look a bit ominous. They make the absolute most of the space, for sure- there are a ton of tables but it doesn't feel over crowded. "
,,,,,"Now, to the food- we had the naan crudité, and honestly, I could have eaten just that naan, it was so good. Some in our party found the hummus to be quite garlicky, but I enjoyed it. We got a good variety of entrees and cocktails, both of which were inventive and tasty. The tonkatsu was AMAZING, and it seems a silly thing to mention, but the French fries were hands down the most flavorful fries I've ever had. We were celebrating a birthday, and our server brought us a funfetti milkshake to celebrate! Overall, we had a good experience and the food was VERY good. We would definitely eat here again, and I think it's worth a trip!"
,,,,,"Little Goat confused me.  I don't know if they were so overrated, that I gave them 2 stars, or is this really a 2 star establishment?  I visited the restaurant Memorial Day weekend with a 30 minute wait.  Not too shabby.  We walked around ""Restaurant Row"" until we received the anticipated text message.  We made our way back to the restaurant and were seated."
,,,,,"We started off with a barista lemonade tea (which was on the ""specials"" menu) as well as a cappuccino.  The tea tasted like crystal light mixed with robitussin and the cappicinno was so cold, I confused it with a frapp.  So far, no good."
,,,,,"Next, our goat chili cheese fries came to the table.  The goat chili was flabbergasting!  It was hearty, meaty, but not too heavy--it reminded me of coney sauce.  The fries were covered in a blanket of white queso that resembled country gravy.  This was indeed a MISS.  The queso had a corn starchy flavor that was very unsettling.  The taste was tear-jerking and by this time, I started to get annoyed."
,,,,,"Soon after, the entrees came to the table: This Little Piggy Went to CHINA and the infamous BullsEye French Toast.  This Little Piggy Went To China came with a biscuit, eggs, pork sausage, and a chili garlic chive sauce.  Asian cuisine is my all-time favorite so I imagined that this dish would have the most rockin' party in my mouth.  Yeahhhhhh, right.  The idea was there but, the implementation was a no-go. Wayyyyy too much sesame oil... on EVERYTHING.  That's all you tasted. The BullsEye was good.  It certainly wasn't great.  The French toast was a little dry for my liking, and the crispy chicken was crispy cold.  Left half of it on the plate.  "
,,,,,Service? So-so.  Décor? Nothing striking.  I was ready to knock everything off of the table when we received our damn $60 check. Obviously people like this place--I'm assuming I just went on a bad day.
,,,,,"This had been on my restaurant bucket list and did not disappoint. We had reservations on a Saturday evening but still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. This place stays PACKED! Service remained pretty good the entire time though. I insisted we order either a 3rd meal or an appetizer so that I could sample more of the menu. We started with their pork nachos- a HUGE portion of sweet pork and savory toppings. Messy, cheesy, and fantastic. They even traveled home pretty well. I ate the left overs 2 more times before finally giving up and throwing away the rest. "
,,,,,"For my meal, I got the Bull's Eye French Toast- fried chicken, french toast, and a hidden egg in the middle. It had strawberries and syrup too. It had so much going on but it all went together SOOOO well. I took some of that home too, but definitely ate all the good parts at the restaurant. "
,,,,,"I ordered their manhattan for my drink. It was a weird combo with the food, but they definitely make a good, stiff drink! "
,,,,,"I didn't find the prices to be too over the top, and to leave with leftovers made me extremely happy! This place is a gem! Can't wait to go back...."
,,,,,"Pork Belly Pancake. A very nice combination of flavors. Ideally hits in my taste. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. For sure I will come, to try more interesting flavors combined."

,,,,,"I went here with my mom for lunch, and the food was amazing! The staff was so kind and our food came out very quickly, we were shocked. The diner itself is very cute and homey, and the food is incredible. The nachos are so good and the cheese is so different but good. The french toast is an elevated spin on the classic making it 10x better than any other french toast."
,,,,,"Little Goat can be best described as an upscale and innovative diner.  If you come for brunch, it's a good idea to make a reservation since this place is very popular on the weekends.  If you don't make a reservation, you can put your name on the list and they will text you when your table is ready."
,,,,,"This location includes both a seating area, and the bakery.  While waiting for a table, I headed to the bakery side and was tempted by all of the delicious sounding baked goods.  I opted just for basic iced coffee, and it was pretty good but a little on the expensive side at $5 for the 16oz.  "
,,,,,"My friend and I were seated at the bar stool area and were fortunate to be able to see all of the meals coming out of the kitchen.  I think that being able to see all of the delicious options made picking a dish that much harder.  My friend and I shared a cinnamon roll, and it was delicious.  I decided to try the Okonomiyaki (Korean style pancake with small amounts of pork belly and a sauce over it) and was pleased with it.  A few months prior to my brunch visit, I came here at night for dessert and had the apple pie.  The apple pie tasted okay, but seemed to be missing something.  I would likely come back to this place again for brunch if I were in the area, but I don't have a strong desire to since there are other places in the area that I like a little better."
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner gets two thumbs up from this girl right here! I was in Chicago this past weekend and staying in the West Loop so waking up on Sunday morning, the boy and I decided to venture out for brunch.  We decided on the Little Goat Diner and started on our wonderful food adventure. We walked in and there was a huge crowd already waiting, we were quoted a wait time of 30 minutes but the lines were moving quickly.  I think we waited somewhere between 15-20 minutes total.  "
,,,,,"We were greeted in a reasonable amount of time and our server was great!  We ordered the Bull's eye french toast, pork belly home fries, and the tonkatsu.  Oh! Also the mulled wine!  You have the get the mulled wine!!  The bull's eye french toast was delicious with the chunks of chicken in the middle soaking up all that goodness.  The pork belly homes fries were also delicious I just wished it had a little bit more pork belly in it or perhaps chopped up the two big pieces we did have into small pieces to just evenly distribute it.  My tonkatsu was good - the sauce was a bit off for me, maybe a little too sweet?  But it was thinned out nicely and the panko covering was nice and crunchy."
,,,,,"We were in and out in about an hour.  The service was quick and our server was super friendly.  The restaurant is a nice open area with plenty of tables, a little diner counter area, and there's a hidden door to the bathrooms!"
,,,,,"This is hands down, one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Go here and order the nachos immediately. "
,,,,,I've been here 5 or 6 times in the last year and it's a rare west loop spot that I will go wayyyy out of my way for. 
,,,,,"The service is good, the waits can be long, it can be loud and really crowded, but the food is so excellent in every way and makes it 100% worth it. "
,,,,,Milkshakes? The best I've ever had. Unreal. 
,,,,,Shrimp and grits? Fresh and bright and so delicious.
,,,,,NACHOS? My favorite dish ever and I simply cannot believe how good it is
,,,,,"Everything my friends have ordered while I've been with them, sandwiches etc., has been amazing as well."
,,,,,"Oh, Little Goat you get a two thumbs up. Came by around 11 on a Thursday to avoid the lunch rush. Started off with a Bloody Mary. One of the best I've had in a while. Had that full pickled flavor with a hint of smokiness. The kimchi and miso truly made it one of a kind."
,,,,,The menu had plenty of breakfast items to choose from as well as sandwiches and burgers. Lots of Asian inspired flavors and creative spins on classic dishes. It was most certainly a tough decision. But I ended up ordering the little goat went to China and my bf ordered the bull's eye french toast. 
,,,,,"I was actually a bit iffy about my decision at first since I've never really been a fan of biscuits but this flaky cheddar biscuit completely changed my mind. It paired really well with the Szechuan pork sausage and sunny side up egg. Kudos to our waitress for this savory recommendation. However, the french toast was on the sweeter side. Came with fried chicken and strawberries. Totally reminded me of chicken waffles but with a twist. Overall, both dishes were really good and can't wait to come back to try the other options."
,,,,,"I came here with a group of friends for breakfast/brunch, and was definitely not a fan. I can't figure out what all the hype is about or why this place seems to be so popular, other than being a Stephanie Izard restaurant. It was a hot, sunny, heat-index kind of summer day in Chicago when we went, and the restaurant itself was also SUPER hot - we never got to stop sweating and it almost felt nice to walk back out into the blistering sunny heat. "
,,,,,"I was underwhelmed by the menu - it seemed like it was trying too hard to be trendy, and everything on was overly complicated with too much going on. I definitely would not plan on trying to find lighter/healthier fare here, I thought I was just getting some breakfast potatoes but ended up with a bowl full of french fries. I did also get a side of scrambled eggs, and those were truly delightful... I just wished there was something that looked good to go with said eggs. My mimosa also came in a tiny child-sized cup... I'll probably just skip it next time. Our server, however, was delightful."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Such a delicious breakfast! I ordered the smoked salmon and crumpets plate, which was one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. The crumpets were light and fluffy and the fried egg salad is what dreams are made of. The pickled onions and peppers provided the perfect acidic balance. My friend ordered the vegan version with avocado and it was also delicious. We went on a Wednesday and had to wait briefly for a table at 10:00, and there was a little wait for our food, but nothing out of the ordinary. Be prepared, we could not find any place to self park within a mile of the restaurant, so we chose to valet for $18 which added significantly to the overall cost of brunch. But well worth it!! I will definitely be back the next time I am in Chicago"
,,,,,"The Little Goat is listed as a diner on Yelp, but as a NJ native, I'm gonna say this place looks like a diner, but it ain't much of a diner. It's more gourmet than your usual greasy spoon diner, and the prices reflect it. Service was friendly, but it felt like our food took forever to come out. As an appetizer, my group ordered the crab dip, which was served with not enough Ritz crackers. The waitress soon offered us more, but really they could have just included more. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Goat Almighty with a side of the hash browns at the suggestion of our waitress. The Goat Almighty was a hefty goat burger with braised beef and BBQ pulled pork along with jalapenos, cheddar, onion rings, and salsa verde. It's pricey at $20, but very tasty. The hash browns were shredded and cooked on the griddle with cheese, which should have tasted amazing, but ended up tasting burnt. I didn't finish them."
,,,,,"Not much of a diner, but a decent place to grab a bite."
,,,,,We decided to stop in here for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 10:30am. The wait was about 20-40 minutes but they have a bakery section where they have a few booths and a good amount of bar seating that's first come first serve and serves the full menu. We waited about 10 minutes before we found space at the bar. The server quickly brought us menus and water. We started with hot coffee which was fine. Nothing special. For food my husband had the Elvis waffles and the I got the bullseye French toast. 
,,,,,"The Elvis waffles were a big portion. It's 3 waffles with peanutbutter butter, bananas and a bacon syrup(we asked for the regular syrup instead). My husband enjoyed them! He said the waffles were light and fluffy and the peanutbutter butter was different but a good different. The amount of peanutbutter butter they give you is way tooo much. "
,,,,,"The bullseye French toast was unlike something I've ever had. It's an sweet onion brioche with an egg in the middle and topped with fried chicken, strawberries and a bbq maple syrup. At first I thought the sweet onion brioche would be gross for French toast but I was so wrong. The onion flavor was so faint especially in comparison to the other flavors of the dish. The French toast itself wasn't as dense or custardy as I like but it had all the falcons I crave when I went French toast. The egg in the middle was cooked past medium but less than well done. It was a little gooey but not runny. The fried chicken was basic fried chicken. I recommend getting a bit of the egg, French toast and chicken all in one, the flavors work so well together it's amazing. "
,,,,,I recommend coming here at least once so you can try the bullseye French toast. It's a very unique dish. My husband liked his waffles but they weren't something he'd specifically go back there for. I do recommend making reservations if you have a large party because it gets really busy on weekend.
,,,,,Overall the food and service was good. They have a decently sized menu so we'll def be back to try something else next time! We also saw the Owner and Iron Chef Stephanie Izard which was a pleasant surprise!
,,,,,"It takes a lot to earn a 5-star review from me, but this place is well deserving. Stephanie Izard is one of my favorite Top Chef contestants, so we had to try this out on my recent trip to Chicago. It truly is a legit, 50's style diner, but with an elevated menu."
,,,,,"I had the Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich with smoked fries. The sandwich was very crispy with a house-made bun. Delicious. The smoked fries reminded me of the old-school diner fries. We also had the french toast, which was on sweet onion brioche bread, smothered in chicken and strawberries. Completely blown away."
,,,,,"This place did not let us down. Unlike some of the other places we visited in Chicago, the staff here was extremely friendly, with quick service. Highly recommended."
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Stopped here with some gal pals for lunch. It was delish!
,,,,,"I had the pork belly pancake (I asked to add a poached egg) and my pals each had one of the goat burgers. We all loved our dishes and raved about how the flavors are so interesting together. With our dishes, I noticed an Asian flair."
,,,,,"With the pork belly pancake, I think they should just add the poached egg. It was so delicious and really helped pull the dish together."
,,,,,I took half of it home and had the rest for breakfast the next day.
,,,,,We came at a time when it wasn't busy (2pm on a weekday)... so service and all that was great.
,,,,,"I loved this place. My review is mainly for the atmosphere as I only had an appetizer. The place is a nice ""diner"" look with lots of booths. It's cute. The prices are good for the west loop area. Hot crab dip was AMAZINGGG. The chocolate malt shake tasted a lot like malt but I think that I don't like the malt taste as much as I thought so I don't fault them for that"
,,,,,So delicious. Definitely recommend. I suggest you get a reservation or you may be waiting for a while. The staff was very friendly and the food had unique flavors.
,,,,,"This was fantastic. We sat at the  bar and enjoyed watching the bakery buzzing with activity too. The food was awesome - fresh and flavorful. I'm a fan of of kitschy, local and unique. If you are same, then go. You won't regret it."
,,,,,"I would advise making reservations we went on a Friday at 130 we had reservations, however with out them we would have waited an hour. We ordered heavy, because I had wanted to come here for forever and wanted to get a good overview of menu. My litmus test is the cinnamon roll. It was AMAZING! perfect not too sweet the frosting/ glaze was perfect, it's definitely a sharer! The service was also nearly perfect. Food came out at appropriate times and waiter was available but not annoyingly attentive. "
,,,,,"Must order items: cinnamon roll, crumpets, macho nachos, the French toAst with fried chicken, and the side of notso Chinese broccoli!!!"
,,,,,This place is the bomb. Food is amazing and service is out of this world. Not exaggerating the host was one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. He genuinely cared about us which is mind blowing. Our wait time was 10 minutes and right at 10 minutes he came out to check on us and sincerely apologize that the wait would be longer. Kudos to you man you rock. Food is seriously good though and will definitely be back!
,,,,,"I've dined at this restaurant several times and each time it was a hit. This time we got the bulls eye French toast and the Fat Elvis waffles which was topped with sliced banana PB butter and bacon. They were to die for, service was sub par but overall I would come back again just to catch a glimpse of Ms. Izzard and of course for the delicious food"
,,,,,The food was delicious. The waitress was very nice and helpful she checked on us often. I highly recommend here for some lunch.
,,,,,"Due to the 3 hour wait at Au Cheval down the street, it brought us to Little Goat Diner which did not disappoint."
,,,,,"I started with a mimosa while waiting but recognized everyone around me drinking a bloody Mary.  Once I was seated, I had another look at the drink menu and the bloody mary with kimchi sounded fantastic so I decided to give it a try.  This would be on the top of my list for best bloody mary in Chicago.  I just started drinking bloody mary's less than a year ago so I've only gotten to try a handful of places."
,,,,,"For my meal I decided to go with This little piggy went to China.  A cheddar biscuit with sunnyside egg, pork sausage, chili sauce and blueberries.  This may sound like an interesting mix but surprisingly went very well together.  I would definitely get this dish again."
,,,,,"Service was great, super cute breakfast/brunch spot in the West Loop!"
,,,,,"I'm a huge fan of Little Goat and the Little Goat cafe. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table, and it's the kind of place that you go to when you're not really sure what you want."
,,,,,"You can usually skip a wait if you opt to sit at the bar, but either way - great vibes all around. If you're not feeling the vibe, walk over next door to their cafe (you can order the same menu at the bar!) and enjoy the cafe experience."
,,,,,"The Loco Moco is delicioussss as are the sandwiches (the Los Drowned!!!) and salads. Easily a 2 meal kind of place, unless you're overly committed to finishing your plate."
,,,,,Take public transit or Divvy over - parking is kind of a pain.
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"First impressions - your senses are completely overwhelmed when you walk in. This diner is beautiful, and everything smells amazing. The Goat Patty Melt was on point (cheesy + secret sauce + bread and butter pickles). The smoked fries were 5/5 amazing and like nothing I have ever had before. The fried pickles and onion rings were so well seasoned and basically tempura fried - super light and crispy - and came with an awesome ranch and a curry mustard for dipping which was delish. "
,,,,,"Oh, and the Goat Latte (goat caramel, goat milk, chilli pepper) is the perfect thing to kick start your metabolism after stuffing your face. "
,,,,,I must return to try more of the things...*make a reservation - this place gets busy around 8:30 pm!
,,,,,"Since I didn't care enough to plan ahead and get our group a reservation at Girl & the Goat, we ate at Stephanie Izard's other restaurant, Little Goat Diner, instead. Reservations for Little Goat were available same-day on OpenTable. Our dining experience here was A-OK. Given the hype, I was expecting better."
,,,,,"This is a neat, stylish diner with a bakery attached. One thing I think that's cool about its design is the hidden entrance to the restrooms. The door blends in with the wall like the entrance to some secret lair in a movie. I do like the playfulness about this place from the cartoon graphics on the menu to little touches like actually printing the words ""Blue Plate"" on the blue plate special plates."
,,,,,"We visited for dinner where the menu consisted of American breakfast foods, breads, sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, dinner entrees, and apps/sides. Desserts included pies, cakes, shakes, and sundaes and drinks included bottled sodas like Cheerwine, spicy ginger ale, and Mexican Coke. They also have a coffee menu. Expect to spend at least $20-25 per person."
,,,,,"It's American food, but I wouldn't consider it traditional as many of the dishes have creative twists or takes. Here's what we tried:"
,,,,,"* Reuben ($13) - smoked corned beef, kimchi, kraut, havarti, special sauce, Spence rye"
,,,,,"* Korean Burger ($14) - kimchi, bacon, egg, chi mayo, sweet roll"
,,,,,"* Shrimp & Pork Belly ($21) - summer squash, ""shrimpy"" noodles"
,,,,,"* Blue Plate Special ($23) - Alaskan sockeye salmon, corn miso puree, squash, shiitake, pea tips, sun gold cherry chimichurri"
,,,,,"I love good kimchi and Little Goat's version is actually decent. However, I'm not sure I liked it in the Reuben. The spicy and sour flavors of the kimchi just didn't jive with the traditional Reuben for me. The buttered and toasted bread and the quality of the corned beef was good. The sandwich was a little heavy and salty, but overall, not bad in my opinion."
,,,,,"The Korean burger was monstrous and a sight to behold (great presentation). It was difficult and messy to eat because of how big the burger was. All of the ingredients were piled on high. I thought the beef patty was delicious and generally, this was a fine burger. Smoky, savory, and satisfying."
,,,,,"Since I'm allergic to shrimp, I delicately ate my way around the shrimp and pork belly salad. All of the veggies were fresh. This was a simple, light, and refreshing salad. Definitely healthy. The blue plate special for the night was also fresh and healthy. The sockeye salmon was rich in flavor and the vegetable medley worked well together. On the downside, it wasn't filling, but at least I know I was eating smart. I'd order it again."
,,,,,"Service was excellent. The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous. Our orders came out in a reasonable amount of time."
,,,,,"In the end, I think this place is probably better for breakfast, lunch, or brunch than it is for dinner. Regardless, it's still probably worth checking out."
,,,,,I was in Chicago for a short conference and I knew I had to make it out of my hotel in Rosemont to venture into the city for a good meal.  I wasn't able to get a reservation at Girl and the Goat but I was able to get a counter reservation for 1 at Little Goat Diner. This ended up being a great choice for a solo diner so I didn't feel as lonely at a table by myself.  The waitress was very nice and helpful in the menu options.  The couple next to me even offered their suggestions to me. 
,,,,,Breakfast is served all day and there is a wide selection of drinks. I would definitely want to try out the drinks next time.  This time I did the breakfast and ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China.  It was a sesame cheddar biscuit with Szechuan pork sausage and a chili garlic chive sauce.  There was also a fried egg on top.  It was delicious but the numbness of the Szechuan pork sausage was strange for me.  I had a hot yet cold feeling on my tongue that was too much for me.  The flavor profile is very complex and tasty though.  I would want to try something a little less exotic next time so I can handle it better lol.  Overall a fun and exciting dining adventure :)
,,,,,"Little Goat was our best meal on our short trip to Chicago, making reservations ahead is a must! We didn't make ours til about 1 week out, which meant the only seating was 8:15am for our party of 5 (including our toddler). We arrived in Chicago after midnight so it was tough, but the staff was welcoming and the food didn't take long. Plus the large booths were comfy and great for a bouncy 2.75 year old ;-) "
,,,,,"For food, I had the shrimp and grits - a bit salty, but flavorful. Very mild spice and it was very stew like. My husband had the bulls eye French toast which is a egg in the hole style with pre-chopped pieces of fried chicken breast (think the sized pieces like you'd get in a salad). I know it's messier, but with both our dishes I would have preferred shrimp in the shells and chicken on the bone. I feel like at what's considered an upscale diner they'd have large prawns perhaps or show you that the shrimp have been grilled or something. Do midwesterners prefer this style i wonder? We got waffles for my daughter, but she ended up mostly eating the dark chocolate chip pancakes my husband decided to splurge on for the table to share! "
,,,,,"Overall it was an enjoyable meal, very grateful that friends treated us to a nice breakfast."
,,,,,"I came back Little goat diner after a visit several years ago which was as truly perfection. This visit, while good want as great as I remembered. I returned to my favorite ""This little piggy went to China ""'which includes a sesame cheddar biscuit, pork sausage, eggs, and a chili garlic chive sauce. When I started with my first bite I thought .. this is cold! But when I felt the eggs and sausage I realized they were all warm but the chili garlic sauce was very cold which made the entire dish cool. The flavors are amazing so I'll give them a pass but keep the sauce out of the frig so they don't cool off the entree! "
,,,,,We also had pork belly home fries. They were a bowl of flavor! Perfect in every way. 
,,,,,"We were smart enough to get reservations so we didn't have to wait once we arrived but there were only early times available so we really needed that coffee. We could have used another refill but with the number of persons waiting on tables, I hardly blame the staff for gently encouraging us to move along."
,,,,,Went a third time and bumped my 3.5 to 4.
,,,,,The breakfast items are top notch and did better ordering dinner this time with sharing the goat burger- amazing and someone had a pork belly dish.
,,,,,Love girl and the goat so was excited to give this a try. 
,,,,,Dinner: 3: buffalo sauce not very good in my opinion. Nothing tried great. Some pretty good. Good sides
,,,,,Brunch 4: Elvis and the french toast were both fantastic.  Service was surprisingly poor
,,,,,Bakery: 3
,,,,,"Not bad as a diner. Using so much details and add ons for brunch class food is awesome. Bull's eye i would give 9/10 points, having an onsen egg inside the french toast gives extra texture in the mouth. With extra chicken stripe on top makes the dish very fulfilling. Shrimp and grits 8/10 points. I really like how they gave extra flavor to the fluffy texture of the grits by dropping a potion of goat milk inside. But the dish became over complicated with pistachios and lettuce. I guess the Big Bang intention came to a fail. Chicken fingers 8/10. Its rare to find restaurants to use marinated and well beaten chicken breast as chicken strips. Its very tender and flavored. But the batter seems a little too simple, would be much crunchier if battered and fried a couple more times. Goat milk latte is a must try if u like goat milk. "
,,,,,I would recommend this diner if theres no need to wait.
,,,,,You definitely want to make a reservation on the weekends! This place gets packed and for good reason. The food is very good. We came for brunch and enjoyed a couple different dishes. We started off with a very stiff greyhound that was helpful in getting the days started. 
,,,,,"Food is creative and delicious. The shrimp and cheesy grits were very good. BF had the omelette of the day with a mushroom mole and it was very good, if not a little rich. Also had the biscuits and gravy that was excellent. "
,,,,,Service was great. Loved the ambiance and decor of the place. I would come back.
,,,,,"The Little Goat Diner is a good mix of modern, west Chicago and those diner comfort foods we all love. In this day and age, where diners are becoming few and far in this day and age, seeing a place like this is both interesting and great."
,,,,,Service: 
,,,,,"The service here was great. My waitress made me feel welcome, and was friendly and chatty. Food service was prompt, especially for this time of night (7/8 cst)."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"Ya girl can eat. And so, when I go out, I look for a solid price with a good plate. I can safely, and happily, say that this place lives up to that. While you might be hesitant about the pricing at first, what you get for them makes it a solid deal. They got some pretty interesting flavor combos going on, and their presentation is beautiful--for other dishes; there's only so much elegance you can get for a pile of fried chicken, after all. "
,,,,,Coffee:
,,,,,"If you're a diner, you need to be able to produce a good cuppa. Fortunately, this place has it. Their house-roast coffee by Dark Matter is a definite recommendation, and they have a variety of drinks to try as well (my Americano is delicious, thank you)."
,,,,,Music/Atmosphere/Ambiance: 
,,,,,"If you're going out to eat, especially with friends, family, or partners, it's important that you can hear your conversations. The music here is a good level; you can hear it, but it doesn't impede conversations. It's tasteful and in tune with the vibe of the diner. The place is well-decorated and gives a good feeling of openness. It's good for going out with the girls or the guys, but also with family"
,,,,,Bathroom:
,,,,,"Why would I talk about a bathroom? Because like it or not, the state of a restaurant's bathroom says a lot about their cleanliness as a restaurant overall. I am pleased to say that it's great; bathroom is clean, smells good, and is stocked with plenty of toilet paper. Basics, but important ones. Additionally, they have 5 options: one men's, one women's, and three that just say restroom (which is sneakily progressive and fabulous). The women's has a changing station, and so does the men's!"
,,,,,"The item that deserves the moniker of #itsatrap is their smoked fries. They don't look like much in the beginning, but boy is there flavor in these small little potato strips. They go great with a side of their house ranch."
,,,,,I was finally able to come back after 4 years and wow! It's even better than I remembered. 
,,,,,"The ambiance is nice, very pretty and lively crowd. "
,,,,,The food was delicious! Everyone loved their meals. What we ordered:
,,,,,"This Little Piggy went to China: So yummy and flavorful! I've never eaten anything like this. The cheesy biscuit, Szechuan sauce, sausage and egg were perfection."
,,,,,Goat Almighty: Tender meat which was good. not as big as the last time I went which could be a pro or con haha
,,,,,Bull's Eye French toast: Amazing as well. The chicken was crispy and paired with the onion brioche was a flavor I'll never forget. 
,,,,,I didn't try the Chop Chae but my dad really liked it!
,,,,,I love how the whole menu is available all day. I'm recommending it to all my friends. I will be back!!
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner was quite underwhelming and not worth the hype. We went on a Friday morning -- it was busy but the wait wasn't long. Unfortunately, we waited almost 20 minutes to be noticed by a waitress (in a different section! Not even our own..). She apologized for the wait and moved us to a table in her own section. Not a great start, but ok."
,,,,,"The food however was what sealed the less-than-mediocre deal. My friend is dairy free & tried ordering the little piggy went to china. The biscuit has cheddar and there were no substitutions... seemed silly. Couldn't they just give her a different bread? They have a dairy free menu, but she wasn't excited about any of the options. Instead, she opted for eggs, toast, and bacon. They brought out the bread pre-buttered!! (That's not dairy free..)."
,,,,,"I ordered the breakfast ""burrito"" with avocado and bean salad. It was not at all what I expected. Very soggy naan with an egg, tons of avocado, and a few beans sprinkled. It was very bland and had hardly any hot sauce. I don't normally complain about avocado because I love it! But... an avocado and bean salad should have more than 10 beans in my opinion. The ratio was just very off. "
,,,,,The boozy drinks were just ok. 
,,,,,Would not go back or recommend.
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went to China: Just wow. This dish is amazing. I would recommend anyone come to Little Goat Diner just to try this dish. It's a great breakfast dish with amazing Asian flavors. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"Bulls-eye French Toast: From the description you think that it would be a weird combination of french toast with fried chicken, but Little Goat Diner makes it work! The brioche is an onion brioche which gives it a slight savory taste to match the chicken. The syrup has a slight bbq taste to compliment the chicken as well. The strawberries add a nice tangy twist to the dish. Might sound weird, but I thought it tasted great."
,,,,,I love this place. Good coffee. Good food and the service is always thoughtful and fast. 
,,,,,This is a gem in the West Loop.
,,,,,"I love the Girl & The Goat so trying it's sister restaurant was a must. First and foremost the lox and crumpets are the things dreams are made of. Seriously I've gone back just for that dish alone. The rest, has been hit or miss. I totally understand that this place has a completely different vibe and approach than the Girl & The Goat - but it didn't quite live up to the hype. "
,,,,,Don't get me wrong - the food is good. It's delicious. It makes you rethink diner and breakfast food all-together. The combination of ingredients and the complexity of each dish is mesmerizing. I just wish it all jived as much on my taste buds as it did to my eyes. 
,,,,,My recommendation - give it a shot. Be open minded and try as many things as you can.
,,,,,"I've had Little Goat diner on my ""To Try"" list fo' evaaa, and just finally made it there with my +1.  Good choice on his part!"
,,,,,I ordered the Chopchae Burger and we shared the Aged Fries.
,,,,,"The fries came en masse but were kind of ""meh"" as far as flavor. They were the shoestring variety, but were very short and stumpy. ?! I've never seen such skinny little  1"" fries. Is that a thing?"
,,,,,"I ordered the Chopchae Burger because I thought I was getting a burger with a Korean twist (i.e. with chopchae ON it), BUT it turns out that it was a burger - sans bun - on top of noodles and with an egg.  It was GOOD - just not exactly what I was picturing: the menu description didn't mention there was no bun.  I had also requested my burger medium, but it came closer to rare.  Not wanting to have to flag down our pretty-absent and flippant server to have it re-fired, I just went with it. "
,,,,,"My +1 ordered the Grilled Cheese and said it was the most lackluster sammy he'd ever had, and he's eaten (and enjoyed) Little Goat before."
,,,,,"I love diners and my Chopchae ""Burger"" WAS good... but the rest - including the service - was mediocre. Still, I'd try Little Goat again and give them a shot to redeem themselves, because I totally want to love them like everyone else seems to!"
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner is a relatively good iteration from Girl & the Goat. The essence is to take the traditional diner experience and infuse it with adventurous culinary ideas. That said, I recommend staying closer to classic diner foods. I ordered the smoked corn beef hash with eggs, prepared sunny side up along with a chocolate milk. The corned beef was plentiful and actually infused with a smokey taste. The eggs were classic in their style, fried and runny over the thin, crispy hash browns, onions, and accompanied by bits of corned beef. The chocolate milk was so-so, not sure I would order it again."
,,,,,"My wife ordered the patty melt with beef, which was solid, accompanied by smoked fries. The patty melt was hearty, included the special sauce (reminded me of Big Mac sauce), greasy and moist rye bread, along with a nice sized patty of beef on a bed of grilled onions. "
,,,,,"Overall, a good brunch and lunch spot when you're in the mood for an elevated diner. Sticking to savory items sounded right and I expect I'll do the same in the future."
,,,,,"This place is amazing and be sure to make a reservation! We went on a busy Sunday morning (actually Father's Day) for breakfast. Since we had a reservation, we were sat at a nice comfy booth within a couple of minutes. The service was outstanding, friendly and gave great recommendations. Upon request, they have a vegan menu, how cool is that? It has many of the dishes with some simple substitutions so I don't have to even ask for them. Sweet!"
,,,,,"We went with a sampling of a few dishes. First off, everything crumpets. Get this, they were fresh out of the oven hot and delish. Next I tried the scallion pancake off the vegan menu. This was so tasty and fresh; super impressed with the veggies, flavor, and "
,,,,,"presentation. I was having a hard time not getting a sweet pancake and our server suggested a single blueberry pancake. Awesome! Got a taste for it, but glad I didn't get a full order. It was probably my least fav of the bunch. We also tried the tempura mashed potatoes. This was a unique dish that had a tasty Asian flare. "
,,,,,"All in all, I would definitely go back and try some of the same and new dishes when back in the Chicago area. Such a creative menu (those desserts going by to other tables looked amazing). I loved the little goat touches, especially the coffee mug. I couldn't resist buying it in the cafe next store. Thanks Chef Stephanie and team for such an amazing meal!"
,,,,,"We were hungry and seemingly wandering without a clear destination when the daughter said, ""Let's go to Little Goat!"" Now, this was a little unclear to the parents who are not from Chicago. In fact, it could have been a reference to a possible pet choice as she has recently been talking about acquiring a furry companion for her apartment. Actually, she was talking about a really fun diner in the West Loop. We apparently arrived at a perfect time as we were seated right away. The menu includes many exciting options. We ordered the Bahn Mi Burger, the Patty Melt, the Grilled Cheese, and the Everything is Everything Crumpets. We had the bahn mi burger with the veggie patty. It was accompanied by a wonderful pickled veggie slaw, orange mayo, mint and cilantro on a fluffy brioche bun. This was really tasty and filling. Our patty melt with a beef patty included carmelized onions, special sauce, pickles, american cheese on house rye. This was a melt in your mouth treat! The grilled cheese was excellent and was made up of gjetost (Norwegian cheese with a sweet carmelly tang - very yummy), cheddar, ham, apple-tomato relish on house made bacon gouda bread. This was so good. The combination was unique and very tasty. Finally, the everything is everything crumpets were very good. The light and toasty crumpets were paired with lox, fried egg salad, tzatziki cream cheese and pickles. Really enjoyable. We had a great time at Little Goat Diner. The service was very helpful and attentive. The dishes we enjoyed were unique  combinations of ingredients and were delicious. Next time we are in Chicago visiting the daughter we will have to try some of the other items on their tempting menu."
,,,,,The food is always good but the wait can be rough. They don't normally take reservations so it makes it difficult to eat here without waiting before being seated. Other than that it's a great place.
,,,,,"Great ambience and fantastic servicr, perfect for a late Saturday brunch! The booths were comfy and there was plenty of sunlight. Servers were very friendly, quick, and attentive. As a vegetarian, I found it satisfyingly healthy, but not necessarily the best food I've had in Chicago. Honestly, the food I had was slightly bland and needed a little more added to it. Drinks were also decent, but not absolutely the best, but the coffee was quite satisfying. I would recommend this as a safe option for a brunch or warm meal in this area!"
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"First time indoor dining in over a year and I felt really comfortable here! Employees were very respectful and patrons are required to wear masks when waitstaff is at tables and on walk to the restroom. Our booth was in a low traffic area so we felt comfortable hanging out and having a second round of cocktails after our meal. We had the chickpea salad (as an app for 4 & we all had a good size portion!) it had an amazing variety of flavors - I really liked the creaminess that came from the tzatziki and it paired with the vinaigrette really well. Texture and flavor was on point! I got the Tonkatsu which was a huge portion of 2 layers of pork fried to perfection on a brioche bun and had a fresh cabbage/carrot slaw that evened it out. We popped over to Sugar Goat for dessert and were able to bring it back to our table and dig right in! We got the strawberry tahini cupcake which is available for a limited time so RUN and get it. Frosting was creamy and not too heavy, strawberry jam filling, and I think toasted sesame and freeze dried strawberries on top? I'll be dreaming about that cupcake!!"
,,,,,"This place is no ordinary diner. Think of it as a hip gathering conjunction with upscale pricing. The food is delicious and part of the experience. The area is divided into diner, bar, bakery, coffee bar, and slight gift shop. "
,,,,,"Reservations can be made until a cut off time. We decided to chance it and arrived at noon. There was a 30 minute wait. By luck, two spots opened at the bar. The bar is in a connected room, and is not part of the reservation seating. It's first come first serve. We were told by the bartender that everything comes in shareable sizes and that you can't go wrong with anything in the menu. Always choose your first choice, he said. "
,,,,,"I ordered the This Little Piggy Went To China (cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage party, chili garlic sauce). This is the most ordered plate at LG, and I can understand why. It's not spicy, like normal Sichuan dishes. But, it is savory and numbing. My husband ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles. He said they were normal but delicious banana and peanut butter waffles with bacon syrup. Great portions."
,,,,,Service at this restaurant (and it's sister restaurants) is guaranteed five stars. People here are polished.
,,,,,"Pricing is on the higher side. It's the West Loop... what are ya gonna do?! Would I come here again? If I'm back in the West Loop and wait time is around 30 minutes (rare), I wouldn't say no."
,,,,,This place is super good for breakfast. Finally came back and came with the team and ordered a bunch of delightful breakfast items. Everything was delish. My favorite- pigs came to China and Elvis waffle. Check out my pics. Trust!!!!
,,,,,I decided to come here for a drink and small appetizer before heading over to AU CHEVAL for dinner.
,,,,,I wanted something light so I ordered the shrimp cocktail and a glass of wine.
,,,,,Service was very friendly and nice.
,,,,,Most dishes served here are breakfast and huge servings.
,,,,,Wine was served in a Drinking glass which was odd.
,,,,,"Anyway , I prefer the BIG GOAT across the street vs this joint."
,,,,,Perfect spot for a boozy brunch!  You can not go wrong with anything on the menu.  A savory breakfast choice with a bloody mary...heaven!
,,,,,"Pretty disappointed given the ratings here. The star of the show was the blue light special of hanger steak and eggs 5/5 but it's on a rotating menu. We were super excited because my fiancé loves sour dough pancakes and they're very hard to find but he didn't even finish it because it was a mediocre pancake with so semblance to a sour dough pancake. I got the apple pancake which was equally disappointing. Would never order pancakes here again. Not burnt or anything specific, just super sub par... like I'd prefer IHOP, kind of subpar. The cinnamon roll was tasty but it was all about the icing. The roll itself was a little dry but the cream cheese had great flavor so that was redeeming. Overall, unless I came for the special, we wouldn't come back here with all the other great choices in Chicago. Oh and they charge $4 for coffee. My fiancé said it was good but really?! That's more than Starbucks. Crazy."
,,,,,Weekend in Chicago and I wanted to have a nice brunch and I came across this place. Here is my review:
,,,,,AMBIANCE/ DECOR 
,,,,,What a beautiful place. It gives you that diner feel but with a modern twist. Perfect ambiance if you want to take friends from out of town or if you are like me from out of town. 
,,,,,FOOD 
,,,,,"There some traditional diner food but since you are there, you might as well get their unique dishes. Some of the dishes are Asian inspired dishes with some fusion twist to it. Recommend the Yum, the waiters will know what you are talking about. Also the Cinnamon buns are delicious and perfect for sharing. Also asks for the today's special. You might want someone out of the menu. "
,,,,,SERVICE
,,,,,The waiters were friendly and nice and gave us some tips of what to order. They were also attentive during our time there
,,,,,OVERALL 
,,,,,Very nice place with great ambiance and food. Also the prices are fair for the quality and portioning. Great choice for breakfast/ brunch.
,,,,,"Made a reservation for 4 on a Saturday night, and they seated us once our party arrived. We ordered the Okonomiyaki, the Pork Belly Pancake, and the Pork Belly Home Fries. Service was amazing (we had a super attentive waiter), and food came quickly even though the restaurant was packed. The food was amazing! Very flavorful, with interesting textures. The pork belly pancake was our favorite - portion size was huge! Would highly recommend for interesting Asian fusion flavors found here in the West Loop."
,,,,,"This place was wonderful. Aesthetically pleasing,in- house Butcher, and in-House bakery. Our server Carl was outstanding- authentic and friendly. The food was delicious. I had the corn beef hash and poached eggs with delicious rye toast and a cinnamon roll.YUM!  We had a party of 10 and they easily accommodated us in a very comfortable spot. Service was quick and friendly. We all enjoyed our meals. The photo booth at the front of the restaurant was really neat as well! Nice touch. Also, they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day!"
,,,,,One of my absolute favorite places to eat while in Chicago. This is my second time and I want to go back every time I visit. First time I had breakfast so this time I wanted to have lunch. I had the Fat Club sandwich...soooo yummy! I love the atmosphere and comfy seating-it's a large dinging area but definitely fills up on weekends. Everything I or my friends have tried has been delicious. I noticed they  ask if there are any food restrictions or allergies and that they use organic sugar on the tables. Little details that I notice and appreciate. Love love love. Can't wait to go back!
,,,,,"I highly recommend the little piggy went to China dish. In my opinion, it's the most unique dish there and worth giving this place 5 stars!"
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"LGD!!! Wow, I loved every bite of the white cheddar mac and cheese, goat chili and smoked fries I was able to consume. The service was very attentive and I was so pleased to see bottled soda options (Cheerwine!). The restaurant even offers valet parking, if so inclined"
,,,,,Make a reservation so you don't have to wait! Note: you can't be seated without entire reservation party at the place normally. We were a big party and had a late comer so they let us slide.
,,,,,They have a lot of vegetarian options - we got the paratha burrito and it was very flavorful and yummy. Would recommend it for sure but that's because i haven't tried any of the other dishes. I did have a bite of the veggie burger american style and it was rather bland. I'd stick with the paratha burrito or one of the more exciting veggie burger options.
,,,,,"Service was really good, our waitress was funny and offered good suggestions."
,,,,,"Sweet or savory breakfast options day or night? Then Little Goat Dinner is the place to go. Not just your typical breakfast diner. The menu has your classic dishes like corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy, but also has a ton of unique options"
,,,,,- everything is everything crumpets
,,,,,- bibimbop breakfast bowl
,,,,,- this piggy went to china
,,,,,- okonomiyaki
,,,,,etc etc
,,,,,"Also a bunch of options for sammiches. If you are ravenous, go for the fat club!"
,,,,,A diner that knows what they are doing! Great food and great service. The cinnamon roll was soo delicious. Hot out of the oven. The little goat latte was my favorite! And this little piggy goes to China was also delicious.
,,,,,Literally the best brunch I have ever had in my life. 
,,,,,Was visiting from NYC and found this place on yelp with its raving reviews so I had to try it out. 
,,,,,"Made reservations very easily on open table. Got seated right away. Ordered the bullseye French toast, this little piggy went to china, and then had brown. They were all so good. The bullseye French toast is sweet but loaded with crispy fried chicken and the toast is filled with a runny egg which was a pleasant surprise. The strawberries also add another sweet but fresh flavor to the dish. The French toast is huge so I recommend you share! Then the this little piggy went to china was very savory. I remember it being a little salty and oily but it was still really good. I probably wouldn't get it the next time "
,,,,,"However the best thing I ate here was hands down the HASHBROWN. you HAVE to get it. It's like perfectly crispy yet moist and filled with cheese. Wow it was so good. You don't even need ketchup because it's seasoned well. If I can go back to Chicago, I will definitely be eating here like 3 meals a day."
,,,,,"Little Goat features 5 star dishes (i.e. Bulls Eye French Toast, Goat Almighty & Los Drowned) and 2 star dishes (i.e. Boo Boo Baise & Crisp Shrimp Cocktail). The shakes sound better than they taste and aren't worth the $8. The fries are solid, but not worth $7. Service can range from shoddy to stellar. The host booth also lacks consistency."
,,,,,"It's best to make a reservation because Stephanie Izard is as popular as Brendan Sodikoff, but wait times aren't usually too crazy. Loyal foodies often flock to Little Goat as they stall out the 2 hour Au Cheval or Girl & the Goat waiting list."
,,,,,"With arguably the best restaurant strip in Chicago, Little Goat is OK, but there are definitely much better options within a 3 block radius. LG ranks last among the Izard growing empire."
,,,,,"This upscale diner was bustling on a Thursday night. We had a reservation for 8 and we were quickly seated. We had some issues with the menu and substituting things -- my friend wanted her drink without Malort and they refused to do it. We then tried to order a simple vodka drink and they said they couldn't do that either. We also weren't able to put the dressing of a salad on the side which is very strange. We ordered an array of food but the Cesar salad was not good at all. I thought it would be interesting with the Brussels sprouts but it turned out otherwise. The tomato apple soup tasted simply like tomato soup but it was good. I enjoyed my dish which was the shrimp and pork noodle bowl. It was delicious! However, my other friend at the table found a piece of porcelain in her fish tostadas. It could have chipped her tooth since she only realized what it was by trying to take a bite into her food and hearing a crunch. They were very nice to us after that and the manager did offer his information in case she needs dental work. They also gave us a complimentary piece of cake which was delicious. We likely won't be back though."
,,,,,"RACIST HOSTS ALERT: On June 10th 2019,: one white girl and a black host: decided to seat two brown girls from London behind a column by the kitchen with no light- when I asked are there any other seats, when there clearly were lots of tables free- the white host smirked and said no they're all reserved. "
,,,,,"So I went on the open table app and booked a table immediately and walked back to the Black girl host who looked annoyed at us for not obliging and hiding our shameful brown selves at the kitchen door to eat our food in the dark, and they then with my reservation in hand sat us in a booth with natural light. WOW WAS THAT WAS SO HARD FOR THEM TO DO THE FIRST TIME AROUND? They had no prior judgement outside of knowing we speak English and were brown. So tell me what else could have caused such rude ignorant behavior? "
,,,,,"Outside of the door staff being RACIST AF- the server was incredibly helpful, friendly and attentive. The food was great, and had we not had such a terribly RACIST first encounter this would have received about 4 stars overall. "
,,,,,"I am a well travelled girl who has lived in over 5 countries, Dined in Michelin starred  restaurants ( that's extremely fine dining Incase you didn't have any idea what that actually is!), and traveled to over 30 countries. It's a shame this discrimination from RACIST STAFF AT LITTLE GOAT overshadowed the whole experience for me now. Such an incredible shame to be shown up by a customer, when you say there are no seats available, and then to see they actually have space to accommodate us at a reasonable table with actual light to read a menu- ( is it strange for me a paying customer to actually want to SEE my food and menu to read in actual light?! Am I reaching for too much here at a normal restaurant?) to be shown to a nice well lit area - where clearly there were seats available all that time they didn't want two girls like us to be seated at?! "
,,,,,"What is it called when a BLACK HOST OF LITTLE GOAT SHOWS BLATENT DISCRIMINATION TO TWO BROWN WELL TRAVELLED, EDUCATED AND ELOQUENT GIRLS FROM LONDON WHO ASK TO GET A TABLE FOR BRUNCH AND GET SAT IN THE KITCHEN CORNER IN THE DARK BEHIND A COLUMN WITH NO LIGHT TO SEE THEIR MENUS, LET ALONE EAT THE FOOD THEY WOULD HAVE GRACIOUSLY PAID FOR? I THOUGHT CHICAGO WASN'T A SMALL TOWN WITH SMALL TOWN MENTALITY? Turns out it's racist AF to brown people at Little Goat. BEWARE: & DONT EAT here. "
,,,,,"Am just sorry it's taken me so long to write this Incredibly revealing review of how small minded Chicago and at Little Goat staff really are. Suggestion to the Human resources team qt Little Goat: Maybe Incorporate some DIVERSITY TRAINING into the onboarding process? People of intelligence and affluence come in all shapes colors and sizes, and countries may I add - So maybe it's time your staff should be aware of it now too????"
,,,,,"TL;DR Key word: interesting. The food here is... interesting. Lots of fusion flavors that will leave you thinking, ""Hm, interesting..."""
,,,,,"I love the concept of this diner, although I think this is a place that you'd have to do a lot of eating trial and error in order to find *the* dish that speaks to you..."
,,,,,---FOOD:
,,,,,"Tempura Mashed Potato (4.5 stars): Do you like mashed potatoes? Do you like fried things? Well, then you'll probably love tempura mashed potatoes. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside-- the texture contrast is out of this world."
,,,,,"Fish Tostadas (4 stars): Fish tostadas that taste like fish tostadas and are pretty decent. Hard to eat-- you're gonna wanna use your fork and maybe your knife, too."
,,,,,"Pork Belly Pancake (3.5 stars): This would be a great hangover meal. The scallion pancake tasted like it was made with butter and then cooked in butter, which isn't a bad thing, but one bite was enough."
,,,,,"Chop Chae Burger (2.5 stars): ""Burger""... So this is like chop chae (japchae) with a burger patty on top. There is no bun for this burger. It is not a burger. Personally, I found the flavors of this dish to be unbalanced, like way too much vinegar or something. Interesting concept with interesting flavors but ultimately a real let down. There wasn't even anything special about the burger patty."
,,,,,"---EXPERIENCE: Kind waitstaff and they let my large party of 16 split the bill 16 ways, no problem. "
,,,,,"I would give this restaurant another shot, but I would order different things. "
,,,,,Visited: 1/28/19
,,,,,"The Little Goat is popular with the locals but I wasn't impressed. The service is great and the food comes out timely manner but the food was under-whelming. The ""biscuits and gravy"" is mushroom gravy and it had no flavor.  The corned beef hash was pretty good with lots of corned beef and onions.  My biggest frustration was that they make their own salsas in-house and they are terrible. Their version of spicy hot sauce was a weird reddish creamy goo. Ugh! I really wanted tobassco and they didn't have any - not even in the bar. (whaaat?!?!)  The BBQ sauce tasted like bad ketchup. Overall it was very ""meh"" so I won't go back. There are lots of other great places to have brunch in the city that I'll try going forward.   The bloody Mary's are $12 each."
,,,,,"They do sweet stuff well - desserts, pancakes, sticky buns, french toast, etc.  They looked good. Go for the sweets but lower your expectations on the savory."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Yum !! Met a friend for brunch and couldn't decide oh what to order ... I got the Elvis waffle... waffle with peanut butter,banana and syrup (minus the bacon as I'm vegetarian ) "
,,,,,Two huuuge waffles and so delicious ..can't wait to go back and try their other veggie options
,,,,,"4.5 stars. I landed at Midway International and headed straight for this place. I needed my hometown fix of over the top culinary greatness and they did not disappoint.  The hostess - my server, Rebecca - the kitchen staff - all wonderful. I made a great choice for my first stop, this trip."
,,,,,The coffee reminded me of the bold and soothing blends you normallly find in the Pacific Northwest (I had to buy a bag).
,,,,,"The chili is a one of a kind recipe, nontraditional and expertly prepared... deliciously surprising. "
,,,,,"I couldn't order a sandwich, because I was on a no bread week - so I asked them to make me Rueben Fries and they did it for me! Perfect meal and great staff."
,,,,,Thanks Rebecca and Little Goat Diner!
,,,,,"Without a doubt one of my favorite brunch places ever. As one would expect from one of Stephanie Izard's brainchildren, you won't find the dishes here anywhere else. Ingredients you would've never expected to go together are harmoniously combined to form dishes that are nothing less than exquisite."
,,,,,"Service is always great and the servers provide excellent suggestions and descriptions of each dish. The decor perfectly complements the food and the room warms up (not temperature-wise) when the sun's out thanks to the large windows enclosing the atrium, both on the side of the building and in the ceiling."
,,,,,"Naturally, given the popularity, you'll inevitably be faced with a wait, but it's well worth it. They'll text you, so you can use the time to wander to a nearby consignment store (as I've done) or explore the surrounding dining haven to figure out what your next meal is going to be."
,,,,,"I've been to little goat several times and i go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars.  They have some interesting twists on breakfast/ brunch but I don't feel it is Chef Izard's forte.  Today I had the big biscuit and gravy.  First it's just that, for $14.  I know it's a Stephanie Izard restaurant but that's at least $4 too much.  The biscuit is large but normal, not groundbreaking.  The gravy is a sausage and mushroom gravy.  I like the gravy okay but it's little on the sweeter side and in my opinion lacks salt and pepper, I'm more of a savory gravy kind of guy."
,,,,,"We'll be back because it's good, but it's not great."
,,,,,Found this place of course on yelp looking for a different breakfast spot to try.  Located on the corner of the street with great views   
,,,,,Walked in and the place was decorated nice and very cleans and friendly staff. 
,,,,,The breakfast was very good and very creative on types of dishes made to eat 
,,,,,I ordered the bulls eye French toast and wow i was impressed.  French toast with a egg in the middle and to top it is chicken and strawberries and surprise surprise they all went together and made a fantastic dish.  
,,,,,This is a must try spot when in the area
,,,,,This is definitely one of my top 3 favorite brunch places in Chicago! 
,,,,,"The atmosphere is really cute and fun, and the service is both friendly and fast. "
,,,,,"The menu is super unique, with everything from bacon maple syrup to parathas to curried cauliflower. "
,,,,,"I've had the dark chocolate crunch pancakes which were so good. The perfect amount of decadent! I've also had the parathas burrito, which sounds like a really random combination when you read the description, but is actually incredible. "
,,,,,Can't wait to come back and try more! The only thing I haven't liked on the menu is the hash browns. They were too crunchy and not super flavorful.
,,,,,"The shop is beautiful, but do make a reservation!  It gets busy but is worth the wait.  Everything is beautifully presented and tasty, though pricey for the portions (not unexpected).  While waiting, you can go watch them make baked goods in the bakery/coffee shop next door!"
,,,,,Excellent spot to grab a late breakfast with WiFi. The staff seated me quickly and efficiently. The service was courteous  and frequently check-in on if I needed anything. More importantly the phone was delicious and I'd come back for the crumpets with everything.
,,,,,"Visiting this place is such a fantastic thing to do, especially when you are looking for beautiful space where you can spend your time with your friend or family. Everything here at Little Goat Diner was so fantastic, their employees was very patient, kind, informative, and friendly. Their waiters literally know how to explain each of every food at their menu, and they even suggest some dishes to their customers. Some of their craziest dishes on the menu surprisingly fall flat compared to the simpler dishes, they also have okonomiyaki which is so popular to many people, and it was so tasty and incredible. Their place is so nice, clean, and you can feel the great atmosphere they have in their place. It is so comfortable spending time there, friendly employees, great vibe, incredible food, overall was so amazing. I am so glad that I have experience their great place, will definitely go back again soon and explore their menu, will also recommend and introduce this Little Goat Diner to all the people I know, for them to also experience all the things I have experience when I came there. Thank you guys! Keep up the good work! See you soon. Kudos!"
,,,,,"Alexander, thank you for the kudos and all your kind words about our team! Hearing that your server was patient, kind, informative, and friendly makes us so happy. We're thrilled that even our simpler dishes had something to offer and that the okonomiyaki hit the spot for you. We can't thank you enough for recommending Little Goat to the people you know and will look very forward to serving all the folks you send our way! Many thanks for your incredibly kind and thorough review, and we hope we'll see you soon!"
,,,,,"We came here for breakfast, because their menu looked amazing- a lot of meat options as expected, but some other great breakfast like pancakes, fish tostadas and an entire vegan menu! The seats/dining tables were kinda tight, but the interior is lovely and has a diner feel to it. "
,,,,,Fish Tostadas ($14)-4/5 Three decent size pieces of fish tostadas perfect for 1 person or even to share if you're getting a lot of dishes. I really enjoyed this with the hot sauce. Everything was tasty- the tostadas and fish were crispy and this dish was loaded! 
,,,,,Hot Crab Dip ($12)-4.5/5 Crab dip in the morning?! Yesssss please!!! This delicious hot melty crab dip with simple ritz crackers was probably the best thing I had. The whole table loved it too!
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Little Goat is a solid diner to eat at when you are in the area. We usually stop in when we are waiting for a table at another nearby restaurant. It's a great place to sit and order some appetizers and drinks while you wait. 
,,,,,"For this visit, we decided to share the hot crab dip and the pork belly fries. The dip was filling and tasty. It comes with ritz crackers-I would prefer to soak up all of this deliciousness with bread, but the buttery crackers pair well with the cream cheese and crab dip."
,,,,,"The pork belly fries aren't really ""fries"". I would say they are more like pork belly -tato chunks. The potatoes are thicker, and sometimes that awesome pork belly flavor from the meat morsels can get lost in the sea of taters. However, the portion is very filling and the pickled jalapeños add an extra oomph of tastiness. "
,,,,,"I paired my food with some Vandermill Totally Roasted. I love that they have this on draft, along with a decent list of other beers. Service is good, especially for how crowded it gets in here. Yup, Little Goat is alright in my book. I appreciate being able to nosh on some tasty fare while waiting to go nosh on even more tasty fare somewhere else."
,,,,,I absolutely love Little Goat. I've been here multiple times with friends and have gotten the following:
,,,,,"Goat Almighty ($20 but enough for two easily): delicious combination of meats, burger toppings, etc on a buttery brioche bun. I especially love the yucatan pork. Yum!"
,,,,,Fish tacos: So delicious. I love the flakiness of the fish combined with their fresh slaw. 
,,,,,"My friend swears by the Los Drowned. It was my friend's bday and they gave her a cake shake for free. I will always be back for their speedy service and their delicious foods, cheap prices, large portions."
,,,,,Great service. Food made real quick. Desert was the highlight. 
,,,,,They squeezed us in on a busy Saturday. Gotta love that.
,,,,,"Amazing inside & out! Stopped here yesterday to catch up with a friend over brunch, we were blown away! This was our first time and we had heard good things and wanted to try it for ourselves. Not only is it beautiful inside, but the food is incredible. I ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast which was absolutely perfect! Not too sweet, it was the perfect blend with the strawberries, crusted chicken, egg, and french toast dripping with syrup. I would definitely order this dish again! My friend ordered the Little Piggy went to China. She enjoyed it at first but said she was overwhelmed with the strong flavors. I tried this dish and i really enjoyed it but I would 100% recommend the french toast. However, loved our experience here! Great service, great ambience, and a great time! We will be back soon :)"
,,,,,"I've been to The Girl and the Goat, and I absolutely loved it. So I had high hopes for Little Goat Diner, and it didn't fail me. This was one of the first place I made reservations here when my boyfriend and I decided to go to Chicago."
,,,,,"I made reservations here about 1.5 months in advance (I'm a huge planner). We got there around about 10 minutes before our reservation time and we had to wait a little bit. Probably 15 minutes we were finally seated. Our waitress was okay, not super friendly. She disappeared for a little bit, where she kind of just hung out by the other servers for a little bit before she came back to take our order. A little weird, because the place was PACKED. "
,,,,,"The food took a little while to get out. But when it finally did, it was AMAZING. I ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast. I've never had anything like it, onion brioche for the french toast, fried chicken and strawberries on top with an egg in the middle of each slice. The flavors blended so well together. The sweetness and the savory were great, I loved the strawberry with the fried chicken mixed in with some of the yolk. The chicken was fried perfectly, I loved it. My boyfriend got the okonomiyaki with pork belly and a side of bacon. It looked tasty, although he was a little underwhelmed with the amount of pork belly in it. "
,,,,,"The food here was AMAZING. I love the creativity of the dishes and how well the flavors go together. I saw that they had a table set up for an 18 person table. I'm super glad we got there before them, I'm not sure how well they would do with a large table like that. "
,,,,,"I loved the food here, and I can't wait to come back and try more food! I like that you can make reservations here! And they try hard to get you in there when they can. Hopefully the service is a little bit more friendly, but if you're visiting Chicago like we were, you definitely want to try this place out for brunch!"
,,,,,"The French toast is a 10/10. The Little Piggy went to China gets a rating of culturally confused. I didn't enjoy the numbing sensation and it hard an off bitter and sour taste to it. I also didn't find it spicy at all, just numbing from the peppercorns. I actually found the dish too much to finish myself and had to share with someone else. However I would highly recommend the French toast. "
,,,,,Great joint for a nice brunch. I got here earlier in the day so I didn't have to wait in line. I would highly recommend this place as the quality of the food is food and the service was pretty attentive.
,,,,,I like this place and i think it is the only place in Greek town that I feel full when I ordered less. They provided very big meals and very yummy!
,,,,,The waitress are pretty and lovely!
,,,,,This place is incredible. KELLI was incredible.   The food??? Incredible. Do yourself some serious favors and get her to eat a veggie burger ASAP.
,,,,,Loved the place. Cozy environment and the food was soo good. We had plans for dinner which is why I was a bit skeptical but turned out amazing. We enjoyed our food and drinks.
,,,,,"I have been wanting to try a Stephanie restaurant and was really excited when I got the chance with a company lunch on this particular Monday. The atmosphere here is fun and casual- I love the diner feel and the decor of this place. The wait staff was excellent, and the menu was interesting. It was all wonderful, but I think I just ordered the wrong dish...."
,,,,,"I should've known better and ordered a dish with goat in it. However, my eyes automatically went to the bi bim bap dish on the breakfast side. My first mistake was to look at the breakfast side during lunch hour I guess. I was between this and one of the salads and was prompted by our waitress to choose the bi bim bap dish. I was pretty disappointed when it came out. The dish was very liquidy- I felt like I was eating soup. And as a native Korean (where this dish originally sprouted from), the dish was not to my liking because it was so different than what I was used to. Kind of flavorless to be honest. My hungry eyes looked to everyone else's dishes with jealousy..."
,,,,,"I did have a nice hot tumeric ginger tea though. This had a nice pang. Like I said earlier though, everything was great except for my dish choice. I look forward to coming again and ordering the right dish this time around."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This place has been on my list for a while, partially because I've never planned ahead enough to get reservations to the girl and the goat. Someday...."
,,,,,"Anyway, this is definitely diner food with a flair so I'd recommend liking diner food first before coming here (diners are not completely my thing)."
,,,,,"Parking- difficult in the area, street or lots a few blocks away, valet is $16"
,,,,,Reservations- needed! This place is popular!
,,,,,"Ambience- casual, but beware it is extremely loud. Something about the acoustics in this place is off because by the end of dinner all of us were a little tired of trying to talk loud enough to hear each other!"
,,,,,"Food- we got the focaccia, Reuben sandwich, and shrimp and pork belly and little piggy went to China. The Reuben was great and the addition of kimchee was a welcome twist! The focaccia was great as well but most of the group agreed the Hong Kong cream cheese didn't really compliment it. The best dish was the shrimp and pork belly-we added a poached egg per the recommendation of our server and it was great. The little piggy went to China  was basically biscuits and gravy and although it obviously is a lot different than the standard dish I was hoping to get more Asian flair from the sausage. The biscuit was great on this but as a entire dish it fell flat if my expectations."
,,,,,Passed on dessert- there are various items including milk shakes for about $9.
,,,,,I'd recommend this to anyone who has a soft spot for the casual diner who has a loud voice and great hearing but for any foodies that tend to like more unique dishes and a relaxing dinner environment you've been warned!
,,,,,Not your typical brunch place!
,,,,,Even my husband who's not a very big brunch guy was very impressed.
,,,,," A lot of the dishes have international influence, especially Asian spices. "
,,,,,"The hubby got the Okonomiyaki which is a Japanese savory crepe with toppings on top and I got the Everything with Everything that came with a few crumpets, lox, pickles, etc and once you mix everything, it was very good and very creative."
,,,,,Everything was very flavorful. The place is very cozy and the service was on spot too.
,,,,, I recommend a reservation through Opentable as there was quite a wait when we went.
,,,,,"If you go with an open mind and don't expect the typical pancakes or omelettes, you will enjoy it."
,,,,,Definitely check out the bar/store next door where you can buy some sauces by the same chef!
,,,,,One of my favorite diners ever! Never had anything bad from this place. This was one of the most unique shrimp and grits recipes you'll ever find and it was fantastic!
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"We always come for breakfast and usually try to come during the week to avoid long wait times. My wife and I love all of Stephanie Izard's restaurants and her ""diner"" is no exception. All the dishes are familiar, but with her twist on the recipe and we always love coming back to try new dishes."
,,,,,"I love Stephanie Izard and after several visits to Girl and the Goat, I was excited to try Little Goat Diner. The visit contained some great and some not so great experiences."
,,,,,Great: 
,,,,,"-Table service was solid. Not in your face and annoying but prompt, kind, and good at their job. "
,,,,,--Our complimentary appetizer was great. I was shocked at how awesome the sesame bread was. Definitely fresh made from that kitchen with great flavor. 
,,,,,"My side dish was huge, and the star of the meal. The pork belly home fries hit all the right notes. A crispy, salty, savory delight. "
,,,,,Not so great:
,,,,,"-We put our name in but never received a notification text when our table was ready. The estimate was 45 minutes, so at 60 minutes I went back with that feeling something was wrong, and it was. We verified the glitch was on their end yet seemed to have to push pretty hard to get immediate seating. Not cool."
,,,,,"-My main course was not good. I ordered the los drowned sandwhich which sounded good but the flavors clashed vs. combined, IMO. "
,,,,,"I'm glad that I have it a try, but I'll stick with the OG when back in Chicago."
,,,,,"Every May I'm in Chicago and every May I say to myself, ""I have to get to Little Goat Diner"". Every year I fail, until this year..."
,,,,,"I made it my mission, I'm going! And I did! And thank GOD I did."
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner, much like most popular Chicago restaurants doesn't necessarily require reservations, but don't go expecting to be seated immediately. Luckily for us, the wait was under an hour."
,,,,,"It's called a diner, but this isn't your typical greasy spoon. Think of your local diner from back home if they won the lottery. Still has somewhat of a diner charm but with much more style and dimly lit."
,,,,,"Our waiter was amazing. We asked for recommendations and he basically broke down the entire menu which is deceivingly large. They have breakfast all day which is a plus, but I opted for the club sandwich with their smoked fries. As an appetizer we all shared the nachos."
,,,,,"Nachos- Woah! This is a meal in itself. Homemade chips that definitely aren't your average Tortilla chip. These thick, crunchy delights are topped with pork, guacamole, cheese, and more! Everyone had to her ""oh em gee"" look on their face upon first bite."
,,,,,"the Club had turkey, ham, tomato, lettuce and guacamole on toasted bread. Super tasty, especially if you love sandwiches and boy do I. The fries were so addictive that when someone tried them I wanted to give them an evil stare. Don't touch my fries, man!"
,,,,,"Such a good meal overall. Great service, amazing food, great atmosphere and I cannot wait to come back and try something else!"
,,,,,"Went for brunch on a Sat and the place was pretty crowded.  Had an 11:15am reservation and probably were seated at 11:25am.  Overall, some complex flavors done well at this Asian American fusion gem by Stephanie Izard.  Dishes do not hold back on some core asian flavors (eg, kimchi in the Bloody Mary, fish sauce in the pork belly tots) but everything works in each creation we tried. "
,,,,,Service was quick and friendly and actually let us linger for longer after we finished our meal (perhaps because the brunch rush was over).
,,,,,Piggy Went to China: 4/5
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Solid spot for the first food stop on my Chicago trip. 
,,,,,"My friend and I came around 9 am on a Saturday after arriving early on a red eye, and the wait for two was around 10 minutes. There is both indoor and outdoor seating, and when you check in, you can specify which area you prefer."
,,,,,"We ended up getting seated outside which was fine as it was a fine summer day outside in early Sep. I was super excited when I saw the smoked corned beef hash with eggs ($14) on their brunch menu, as that's my go-to brunch dish. My friend ordered the parathas burrito ($13) as he had never seen anything like it before and was curious about it. We also ordered a side of hash browns ($6) as I had seen multiple glowing reviews about it on Yelp."
,,,,,"The corned beef hash was different from any hash I've had in the past. The hash was long and stringy and was mixed with many individual slices of corned beef. You can see better in my pictures what the dish looks like. What took me by surprise, though, is that the portion size was HUGE. Maybe it's because I live in San Francisco, but I swear I've never been served such a large amount of corned beef hash before. I was already full at the halfway mark and it was a struggle to finish as much as I could since I couldn't take away leftovers. "
,,,,,"My friend's paratha burrito was...interesting. We both expected it to come rolled up in typical burrito style, but it was more like an open faced sandwich with all the ingredients on top of the paratha. He ate it with a fork and knife and said it was only okay taste-wise."
,,,,,"Our side order of hash browns arrived halfway into the meal, and I was dismayed to see the ginormous size of the dish. It definitely could have been a main meal for someone if they didn't mind only eating potatoes for brunch. Again the potatoes are cut into long strings, which seems to be the norm here. We both ate a couple bites of it to try it out, and while it was pretty amazing, that's all we could manage."
,,,,,"Service was a bit slow, but as we weren't in a rush, we were content to soak in the Chicago sun and enjoy our juice and coffee."
,,,,,"After having such a good meal at girl&the goat the night before, I was so excited to try little goat diner.  I ordered the ""little piggy went to china"" and really did not like it.  The szechuan flavor just did not match with breakfast food.  I felt like I was eating dumplings.  "
,,,,,My friend's foods were also not that great.  The only thing that was good and was the mac&cheese.
,,,,,"We were so excited to come here and it definitely didn't disappoint. The BF and I shared the This Little Piggy went to China, the 3 sister's oatmeal, and the goat milk latte. I liked all three dishes. The sausage and biscuit with chili sauce and berries was so unexpected; it was salty, sweet, and spicy all in one. Really interesting and I think a must order. I loved the 3 sister's oatmeal as well, although it was very rich and decadent. I needed a little more blueberry and granola to balance out the dish. Finally, I thought the goat milk latte was very unique (in the best possible way). I don't love goat milk but I think this latte was superb in highlighting it. "
,,,,,"Even though I was a little groggy at 6:30 a.m., it was still a very memorable meal. I highly recommend to fellow foodies, especially if you can't get a reservation at her other restaurant!"
,,,,,Worst food. Limited and pricey menu for no reason. Avoid this diner. Avoid veggie omelette coz they add tons of blue cheese.
,,,,,"All the restaurants in this group are amazing, and this one is just as delicious as the rest! Great place for upscale diner food! Love all the Japanese inspired dishes and the milkshakes are also a must for dessert!"
,,,,,"Okonomiyaki was fluffy and tasty, slightly thicker than I'm used to.  Kids had the ham sandwiches with smoked fries and those fries are worth your calories.  Corn beef hash was tasty with a poached egg.  Make a reservation, no point in walk in."
,,,,,"Scrumptious, delicious pork belly/kimchi/brandade/eggs over biscuit.  It's like eggs benedicte on high gear.  The pancakes with kimchi/egg/bacon is all cooked together on the griddle so all ingredients kinda meshed together.  If you prefer your ingredients separate, skip this dish.  Friendly staff who answers all customers' questions patiently."
,,,,,"After failing to get a reservation at Girl and the Goat during our visit to Chicago I booked a table at the next best restaurant: Little Goat Diner. Little Goat Diner is also ran by Bravo's Top Chef, Stephanie Izard, and features unique and innovative takes on classic comfort food. The unforgettable combinations left me wanting to book another trip to Chicago just so that I can eat here again!"
,,,,,"I made a reservation for Sunday morning at 8:30am. This was probably unnecessary as there was no wait this early on a Sunday, but by 9am a line started to form out the door so I would highly recommend making a reservation if you are not an early riser. "
,,,,,"We started our meal off with the most amazing coffee. I ordered a macchiato, my husband order the razzle chai latte, and my sister ordered the little goat latte. My macchiato was great but my husband's and sister's coffee beverages were mind blowing. If you like goat's milk/goat cheese you must order one of these tangy and sweet coffees. They were unlike anything I have tried before and I now wish all coffee shops offered the option of goat's milk! "
,,,,,"My sister ordered the most popular dish on the menu, The Bull's Eye French Toast. This life changing dish includes sweet onion brioche bread with a sunnyside egg cooked in the middle (think eggs in a basket). The french toast is topped with strawberries, diced fried chicken strips and bbq maple syrup. I hate myself for not ordering this dish. I had several bites off my sister's plate and the sweet and savory combination was so addictive!!!"
,,,,,Pork Belly Tater Tots: 4.5/5
,,,,,Los Drowned Sandwich/ 4/5
,,,,,"I've dined here twice now (once on my own dime and once on company dime) and I just don't get the hype around the food. It's so heavy and salty. The milkshake is $9 and I didn't enjoy it because it was ridiculously thick and sweet and had to abandon it. In my most recent visit, I had the this little piggy went to China, which is a yelp favorite, and it was too salty. If the sauce was kept separate from the sandwich, it would be more palatable. I did enjoy the sides that my table ordered; tempura mashed potatoes, french fries, and brussel sprouts which were cooked to perfection."
,,,,,"What an incredible find. We found this gem on Yelp. With gluten free, dairy free and milkshake menus, there was something for everyone in our party. "
,,,,,"The biscuits and gravy, dairy free chocolate milkshake and lemon cake were the highlights for us today. Not to mention delicious loose leaf tea that was brewed right st the table.  And we cannot forget our amazingly well informed and helpful waitress, Minty. The food came quickly and was very fresh. "
,,,,,Luckily we got a table outside on such a beautiful day.  This is a local must and a charming way to experience Chicago.
,,,,,"Just ok.  Nothing on the menu (for breakfast) looked overly appealing.  I had a hard time choosing, but settled in on an omelette; I forget the name, but it was kind of a play on chilaquiles.  Hash browns were solid (an extra 7.00),  because they were sitting high on a plate with plenty of cheese.  Hubby's corned beef hash was ok, but not awesome either.   I can appreciate the freshness and quality ingredients but not enough to come back for breakfast, maybe lunch.  Service was also just ok."
,,,,,"So dang good. Went for brunch - started with the nachos, each ingredient better than the next, all handmade in the restaurant, so perfect. Then had the corned beef hash - the potato hash was out of this world, so crispy and thin, best potato hash around. The corned beef was super thin and there was a ton of it. Really nice combo. "
,,,,,"Moral of this review - nachos are outstanding, get the potato hash too!"
,,,,,"I ordered The Little Piggy Went to China. My dish included a sesame cheddar biscuit with szechuan pork sausage, sunnyside eggs, strawberries and chili garlic chive sauce. I absolutely loved my dish, but it was a little too early in the morning for the chili garlic chive sauce. I would definitely order this dish for lunch instead of breakfast."
,,,,,"My husband isn't much of a breakfast eater so he just ordered the pork belly home fries. This side dish was HUGE and is meant to be shared with an entire table. Fried potatoes are combined with large chunks of pork belly, pickled peppers, fish sauce vinaigrette and garnished with cilantro. This dish puts all other home fries to shame! "
,,,,,I will definitely be dining at the Little Goat Diner next time I visit Chicago!!!
,,,,,"I recommend to my friends from out of town to visit little goat diner as an alternative if they aren't able to get a reservation for girl & the goat. The food is very solid, it's much easier to get a reservation, it's cheaper and more casual. "
,,,,,"The ""this little piggy went to China"" dish ($14) is very popular on yelp and I can see why. It was very tasty. It has a sesame cheddar biscuit (yum), sunny side eggs, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. What's not to like? "
,,,,,There's a lot of other creative dishes on the menu that I want to come back to try.
,,,,,Food: 3/5
,,,,,Service: 4/5
,,,,,Ambiance: 3.5/5
,,,,,Overall: Id give it another chance to try some other dishes but I wasn't overly impressed my first time here.
,,,,,The extended review...
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,Fat Elvis waffles - As I read this on the menu it was the toppings that make It appealing.  The actual dish itself though was a little disappointing.  The waffles were a little bit soft...I tend to like them crispier.  The toppings made the dish really sweet which usually I am for but I think it was more sweet than I expected.
,,,,,Mocha cake - the cake was ok.  Fairly moist and the frosting was fairly light.  After eating the waffles might not have been a good idea since I was overloaded with sugar that point.  
,,,,,Service: friendly and attentive service.
,,,,,Ambiance: very casual and very busy!  Be sure to expect a wait when you go for brunch.
,,,,,"Came here on a Sunday morning around 9am and was lucky that we didn't have to wait! The restaurant was already packed with people, but the hostess decided to let us sit at the communal table corner, where it felt like we basically had the whole table to ourselves!"
,,,,,"The service was great, and we got our food fairly quickly. My party of 4 shared 3 dishes: Little Pigs went to China, Okonomiyaki pancakes, and the strawberry and fried chicken french toast. Just like all other Yelp reviews and pictures about this place, Little piggies went to China is definitely a must try! The scallions and sauce that they pour on the eggs were perfect, and the szechuan pork patty they used were VERY flavorful. The Okonomiyaki pancakes don't get as much hype comparing the other two dishes, but were definitely worth mentioning. In my opinion it was even better than the french toast. The texture was soft but not soggy, and the flavor was amazing. "
,,,,,"It was overall a great experience, and the restaurant is located at a very nice part of town. Lots to see around, and would definitely recommend this place for brunch! Cute decor as well! :)"
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"This place is always crowded (even on a Wednesday lunch hour), but luckily they take reservations so please take advantage of that. It's cute and people's ""go-to"" when visiting out of town or wanting to brunch on Saturday, but I disagree."
,,,,,"Perhaps I'm not a fusion fan, but that's the point of the menu. Lots of flavors everywhere, and I don't think they always work. I've gone for both dinner and lunch. I tried their machos nachos, and it was a soggy mess of flavors partying in my mouth. Would not recommend. I decided to try a simpler ""flavored"" dish so I tried their patty melt. It's decent and hit the craving for a Whataburger patty melt, but not worth paying triple the price for. I ordered fries a la carte with it, and they never came. I asked for it twice and the waitress kept saying ""fries take a while and are on their way"" while everyone else at the table already received their fries! I ended up splitting fries with someone else at the table, and glad I did because it was definitely a lot of fries for one person to devour."
,,,,,"After one brunch Little Goat was instantly one of my favorite spots in Chicago. The restaurant has an easy-going relaxing vibe, service is excellent, and the food is downright delicious."
,,,,,"Everything I tasted here was perfect. I stole bites from everyone in my party, and ended up tasting all of the following: Goat Patty Melt, This Little Piggy Went To China, Pork Belly Home Fries, Reuben, and the Bloody Mary."
,,,,,"The Pork Belly Home Fries are UNREAL. The pickled pepper vinaigrette must have an addictive substance in it, because I could not stop eating these even after eating my entire patty melt and half of my mother-in-law's reuben."
,,,,,"After the home fries, I can't even rank the other items. They were all outstanding and I would eat them again in a second. I enjoyed their take on the Bloody Mary as well... it is kimchi spiced, so it has some tang and smokiness. "
,,,,,11/10 would hangover brunch here again.

,,,,,This is one of my go-to spots. Probably one of the first of a few in the West loop before it got so crazy and congested. Got to love the easy amazing eats and they're amazing use oh goat. Gosh I love this place.
,,,,,"Not sure why it took four visits for this review but here goes. I love brunchin' here because the menu appeals to every palette, making it an easy choice for any dining companion. Adventurous eaters, traditionalists and those who are somewhere in between. "
,,,,,"There are also gluten free pastries made daily and food items for those with dietary restrictions. And while my favorite menu item is no longer offered (taco salad), I enjoyed trying the blueberry pancakes this visit. The oatmeal crumbles was a nice touch. "
,,,,,"Of the items I have tried, these are my suggestions: "
,,,,,- Elotes 
,,,,,- Rueben
,,,,,- Chili
,,,,,- Hashbrowns w/ cheese 
,,,,,- Blueberry Pancakes  
,,,,,- Bull's Eye French Toast served w/ chicken & fresh strawberries 
,,,,,*****A limited number of reservations are offered on OpenTable and valet parking is available for $16 (3 hours).
,,,,,"Great place to find comfort food dishes that have a fun twist. The tonkatsu and pork belly home fries were amazing. Our server was also very friendly and offered great suggestions. The drink menu offered a good variety of cocktails, beer, and wine."
,,,,,"This review is a little old, but I went during COVID in the summer. Customers in line were encouraged to socially distance and the line moved fast. There was plenty of outdoor, socially-distanced seating. "
,,,,,"I've been here on two occasions for a more lunch-y brunch. The first time I got the  This Little Goat went to Korea tacos. Super creative although I don't know if they felt like tacos because they were served on pita, I think.  The second time I got the Parathas Burrito which felt more brunchish. "
,,,,,Will definitely visit again when the weather turns warm again.
,,,,,"This place had gotten so much hype, that I HAD to try it. Most of the time, when people hype up a place, I leave a little disappointed...but not Little Goat! This place was outstanding! On a Friday afternoon, this place was PACKED. 1.5 hour wait list and all. Thankfully my husband, myself, and mom were able to scoop a few bar seats and eat there. "
,,,,,"The menu is diverse and has something for  everyone. We started with the crab dip that was out of this world! Real crab meat, cheesy, and hot..what more could you ask for? I got the Apple cinnamon pancakes that were delicious and well-priced! I even took home leftovers (anyone who knows me knows that never happens). Everyone raves about the hashbrowns but to be honest I didn't like them. They had a weird oily aftertaste, but everyone else was on the bandwagon. "
,,,,,"The pastries look so delicious, but we resisted. We were so stuffed! "
,,,,,Can't wait to go back! Next time we will make a reservation...
,,,,,I'm not even mad about the 4hr wait at Au Cheval in the middle of a weekday (does anyone have jobs in Chicago?) because it got my hangry butt into Little Goat Diner instead. 
,,,,,"Now that I've had ""This Little Piggy Went to China"", breakfast will never be the same. It has: sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side eggs, sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and seasonal berries. What an incredible flavor bomb of all the things: savory, cheesy, creamy, tangy, sweet, tart, gahhh. Get this! The omelet of the day was perfect too. It contained mushrooms and cream cheese and was not overcooked. I am also a fan of their hash browns which are made up of very thinly grated potatoes and some cheese too."
,,,,,"It was not quite a 5 star experience due to the slow service and the pricing, though. Though the omelet was quite good, it was small, only filled with one veggie + cheese, and didn't come with anything else, but was $14 + tax/tip. But kudos for serving breakfast all day!"
,,,,,"Breakfast for dinner? Unique, hipster dishes with gigantic portions? A casual atmosphere? Sign me up!"
,,,,,"Every single thing on the menu sounds drool worthy and unfortunately for my party of 4, we were only able to order 4 things:"
,,,,,Pork belly home fries: What more could you ask for? Potatoes nicely crisped with pork belly and dressings. 
,,,,,"The ""I can't find it on the current menu but it was an ultra large burger that has no business being served for one person"" burger. Pretty sure it was the lamb burger and it is stacked as high as your face. Make sure to get this to share!!"
,,,,,"Shrimp and Pork Belly: Because you can't ever have too much pork belly. This is a good one to split -- I wouldn't say it's a must have, but it was definitely tasty."
,,,,,"The waitstaff was awesome and you can get a reservation relatively easily, at least compared to the infamous Girl and the Goat. Worth a try and worth coming back!"
,,,,,"Great set up to dine outside during the pandemic.  Good, solid coffee.  Corned beef and hash was tender and delicious.  This Little Piggy went Back to China--incredible biscuit,  good comfort food."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,What is it with Chicago and a 2 hour wait for food? Yeah there are popular businesses but nearly everywhere we looked for food the wait was incredibly long....unless you sit at the bar at Little Goat where you can virtually walk in from the street. 
,,,,,"Our meal here which consisted of hot crab dip, pork belly home fries, Mac and cheese, the fish tostadas and a few drinks was easily my favorite meal of the trip. The food was delicious without being pretentious and the service was friendly without being fake. To top that all off, the prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of food."
,,,,,My friend and I came here around 10 a.m. on a Thursday originally without a reservation. We called about 20 minutes beforehand just in case. The hostess got my name and number down. We arrived right on the dot and they were not full. Better safe than sorry when it comes to making a reservation! 
,,,,,"How could I resist the Everything is Everything Crumpets? My mouth was full of flavors and textures! I was not ready. Such a fun, colorful dish. Crumpet had a consistency that was a mix between a biscuit/croissant and pancake. T'was lovely. I also got a side of brussel sprouts that had crispy onions and toasted almonds. "
,,,,,Interior had a lot of character and the staff was above and beyond. Had lots of questions in regards to the food and menu and was satisfied with answers given by the enthusiastic staff. Food was worth the money.
,,,,,"When it comes to diner menu creativity, Little Goat Diner really thinks outside the box. Here you'll find a variety of classic diner foods with a twist. They incorporate unique elements from around the world into classic American diner items. I tried the paratha burrito and the bulls eye French toast. Both were excellent and very substantial. "
,,,,,"The Paratha burrito is a great vegetarian option. The ""burrito"" has egg inside and it's topped with a mixture of leafy greens, smashed avocado and beans. The orange sauce ties all the flavors together nicely. "
,,,,,"The bulls eye French toast really hits the spot for a completely indulgent meal. The French toast is wonderfully moist, soaked in sweet syrup and has an egg at the very center. As if that's not rich enough on its own, It's topped with pieces of fried chicken. "
,,,,,"I also tried their LIttle Goat latte, which is made with goat milk. It was my first time having a goat milk latte and I absolutely loved it. It's very creamy and has an earthy, natural saltiness to it."
,,,,,"The space is really nice inside, feels very spacious and modern. It makes for a great spot to come with friends and family if you're looking to kick your breakfast/brunch/breakfast-all-day game up a notch. The prices here are higher than average diner places."
,,,,,"So, wow. Came 2 weeks (two Saturdays) in a row just because I couldn't believe myself and wanted to confirm before I made this statement: I think this is the best breakfast in Chicago. I JUST moved from LA and no I haven't even begun to start eating and exploring the culture and foods of Chicago but this place is just excellent when it comes to breakfast. "
,,,,,"Everything we had was phenomenal and fresh. The Okonomiyaki, WOW. I could eat that everyday. One of the most unique breakfast dishes I've ever had. Our server Emma was Amazing, very kind and knowledgeable."
,,,,,This will be a staple in our to go places in Chicago.
,,,,,"Food is on point with a 5/5, but service is lacking in many ways in my opinion. The word diner may be why it's more acceptable but three things bothered me. "
,,,,,"First, you cant call in an order. The only way to ""call in"" an order for pickup is to download the worlds worst food reservation app ""ritual"" which idk about other people but the 3 times I have used ritual to order pickup my order was not made until I arrived and I had to wait another 20 minutes each time. This was extremely annoying and pointless for there to be an app in the first place. LITTLE GOAT IF YOU ARE LISTENING PLEASE LET CUSTOMERS CALL IN ORDERS."
,,,,,"Second, today was the second time I had a waiter who attempted to memorize me and a friends complicated order. I hate when waiters do this because you can guaranteed 9/10 times they will forget something and he did. "
,,,,,"Third, waiters have zero sense of urgency, they wait around and focus on one table at a time, they are consistently talking amongst themselves and laughing probably about what they did last night."
,,,,,"Finally, the food is amazing, this little piggy went to Asia & the Okinayawa or ""YUM"" are both a wonderful array of interesting flavors that make you feel like you are in the pacific rim. "
,,,,,I will continue to come back to little goat and I will continue to receive mediocre service to enjoy the amazing food!
,,,,,"Cinnamon roll: yes, everything you've always dreamed of, pillowy soft, not too sweet of bread but perfectly sweet icing, you'll have to fight over who gets to eat the middle, it's eyes-rolling-to-the-back-of-your-head-worthy. We were still able to order on at 10am on a Saturday morning luckily. "
,,,,,"Bullseye French toast: what chicken and waffles should be. Soft, wonderful French toast with an egg in the middle. You cut into it, bright beautiful yolk creeps out onto the plate. After cutting a piece with egg, stabbing a strawberry and piece of chicken onto your fork and shoving it all into your mouth, you dance in your seat from all the complimentary flavors in your mouth and the crunch of the chicken but sweet and saltiness of the strawberry and egg. Really phenomenal dish. My boyfriend and I split it because we were told it was a lot, and that was the best decision we made all day. "
,,,,,Really tasty stuff they serve here for breakfast/brunch and pretty hip atmosphere and cool digs. Service was decent and the waiter was really great with answering our questions about the menu.
,,,,,Only suggestions would be to refill coffee more often!!
,,,,,"Having fallen in love with okonomiyaki in Japan, I was pleasantly surprised by how well Little Goat delivers this lesser-known Japanese dish that's basically a savory pancake of cabbage, flour, and egg - mixed with a generous amount of mayo and sauce. I wish there was more cabbage to give it some crunch, but I like that it wasn't too-heavily sauced."
,,,,,"The pulled pork sandwich with gochujang mayo has a spicy kick, and comes in two enormous halves perfect for sharing."
,,,,,Look forward to returning to try the sweet dishes which were making my eyes salivate!
,,,,,"I have heard so much about Little Goat Diner, and was excited to try it for brunch!"
,,,,,"Truth be told though, I am not sure I vibe fully with their ""fusion"" vision. I love Asian food, I love traditional American, and I like fusion. Some of these dishes were spot-on, and then some left me wanting more of something."
,,,,,"I got ""This Little Piggy Goes to China"" which I enjoyed overall. It is a rich dish that would benefit from something lightening it up. It felt like a lot of salt and fat without much break for anything else. Friends got Low Drowned, Bibimbop breakfast bowl, and some apple pancakes, among other things. I just felt like a lot of the dishes were missing something - they were good, but they weren't great for me. Take the apple pancakes - they were pretty good flavor-wise but so, so dry texture-wise. I felt like I needed to drown them in syrup to get them down, which then masked all the flavors they had worked on building up. I have had better pancakes most places in Chicago."
,,,,,"I'd be down to come again to reassess. This is definitely a place worth trying because of their concept (and honestly, also worth trying for how famous they are), but don't let the hype overwhelm you."
,,,,,"Great food, great vibe, super relaxed and casual. We enjoyed some of their unique takes on traditional dishes... like their scallion pancake. My husband absolutely loved that dish so much, and will come back just to eat it. The machos nachos were basically hardcore and so super crunchy and delicious, and the fatoush salad was flavorful and filling. "
,,,,,"But people, we must talk about something really important here -- the choco taco. Let's talk about how I haven't had a choco taco in over a decade due to food allergies, and how the choco taco they have here is a) gluten-free, and b) A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It's the little things in life that bring the simplest of pleasures, and this choco taco is no joke. You MUST order it! "
,,,,,"All in we ordered two drinks, and appetizer, two entrees, smoked fries, and a dessert and the bill was wayyyyyyyyy reasonable. So basically we had an amazing meal at an amazing price. Can't beat that! (Oh, and we had leftovers. I call that a WIN!)"
,,,,,"This diner is the best brunch in Chicago! I've never been unhappy with ANYTHING I've had to eat here! The crab dip in particular is amazing, as is the French toast, Elvis, and so many other things!"
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"3 experience. Rounding up to 3.5 because of service, and also because you're paying for creative dishes."
,,,,,Pro tip 1: they serve brunch all day! Love that option.
,,,,,"Pro tip 2: I think you can actually reserve seats ahead of time through the Yelp app! Or was it their website? Regardless, that is in option if you come here with a large group!"
,,,,,"Pro tip 3: they have a coffee shop right next door! It's also owned by them, with a bar seating."
,,,,,"My +1 and I only waited about 5 minutes before we were seated. Mind you, we came on a weekday around 12 PM. It was pretty packed, but turn over is quick!"
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,"1. Bulls Eye French Toast: egg, crispy chicken, sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup ($16) //"
,,,,,"+1 why is it called Bulls Eye? Because when you slice into it, you hit the jackpot: yolky egg! "
,,,,,+1 Liked the maple syrup- had a good balance of bbq in it to balance our savory and sweet.
,,,,,-1 Bread was a bit too soggy for my liking. Not your typical french toast texture.
,,,,,-1 Pretty small portion for how much it costed.
,,,,,"2. This Little Piggy Went to China: sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side eggs, szechuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, gooseberries ($14) //"
,,,,,"+1 I love the chili garlic chive sauce! To be honest, it tastes like something you can get at 99 ranch from the jars..."
,,,,,+1 Liked the biscuit!
,,,,,-1 Sausage did not taste that great. Tasted like the lean sausage from Lou Malnati's.
,,,,,-1 What gooseberries?
,,,,,"Overall, "
,,,,,+1 Great presentation
,,,,,+1 Good service
,,,,,+1 creative dishes
,,,,,+1 nice ambiance
,,,,,-1 Pretty pricey
,,,,,-1 Small portions
,,,,,Give it a try if you are craving brunch!
,,,,,"An average diner. Food was good nothing special. Service was below average. Each dish came to the table several minutes apart, total of 4 dishes took about 15 minutes from first to last dish to arrive. Needless to say the first dishes were cold but the time the last dish arrived. I would have expected more from this chef/ restaurant group, Would not return with other quality restaurants just steps away."
,,,,,"Fantastic food and experience.  I was here for a private group dinner upstairs, so full disclosure my experience was likely different than the diner below."
,,,,,"The upstairs space is gorgeous, with big open windows and an outside patio that can be used for casual receptions (unfortunately we went on a chilly, rainy day, so we didn't get to use it).  The best part though was the open kitchen at the far end of the room, anyone could get up at any point and watch them making our food (sadly, Stephanie Izard wasn't there. :) )"
,,,,,"Looking at the menu ahead of time, I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive at some of the flavor combinations.  But, everything came together quite well!  I enjoyed pretty much every dish (the kale and chickpea salad wasn't quite my thing), and they were all served beautifully.  My favorite though, was the chocolate pavlova dessert-I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but it was the right balance of chocolate and other flavors."
,,,,,"I'm not sure if the food we were served upstairs is the same as the diner, but what we got to try was all wonderful, and it was a great experience.  I'd definitely go back, and will have to make a renewed effort to try Girl and the Goat someday too!"
,,,,,Chef Stephanie Izard of the critically acclaimed Girl & The Goat takes the casual American diner and elevates it to new heights with impeccable cooking and imaginative twists.
,,,,,"The menu features classic diner dishes, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and adds Asian inspired flavors and dishes. Some recommendations are the Everything is Everything Crumpets, This Little Piggy Went to China, Bull's Eye French Toast, and the Shrimp & Pork Belly Noodles."
,,,,,"The French toast has eggs, crispy chicken, BBQ maple syrup and strawberries over some sweet onion brioche. The twist is that the toast has been cored out to leave a hole in which the eggs reside."
,,,,,"The shrimp & pork belly noodles have fideos noodles, which is a Spanish noodle similar to a spaghetti or angel hair pasta. You get chunks of crispy pork belly, large grilled shrimp, veggies, all tossed in a tamarind vinaigrette. The tamarind is very potent, but not overpowering. The pork belly is crispy and tender, and the shrimp is excellent. The noodles are a bit past al dente, but not soggy."
,,,,,"This Little Piggy Went to China is a sesame cheddar biscuit topped with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and some gooseberries. The biscuit is light and flaky, and the pork sausage is flavorful and tender."
,,,,,"The Everything is Everything Crumpets is a fried egg salad with slices of smoked salmon, pickles and a tzatziki cream cheese. The salmon is fresh and everything else works nicely to complement it."
,,,,,"Some recommended sides are the hash browns, bacon and hot crab dip. The hash browns are extra long, stringy and crispy. The crab dip has a bit too much cheese and not enough crackers, but you can always ask for more. The bacon is thick cut with a slightly sweet glaze on top."
,,,,,"There's also a bakery for some delicious baked goods, coffee, gifts and apparel. Service is quick, friendly and efficient, although it can be hard to track down a server if you need anything extra or refilled."
,,,,,"While this place has ties to Girl & the Goat, it also stands out on its own with a menu completely different from what you'd find across the street. This menu is less fine dining, opting to focus more on comfort food. As a result, it feels more approachable, but the cooking is still just as stellar."
,,,,,"Came here for a quick bite to eat before heading off to the airport. A couple things to note, it's better not to come here if you're pressed for time. There's typically a wait, but there's plenty of counter and shared tables if you're ok with that. We were here for a little over an hour and had a great experience. Our server was super friendly and gave great suggestions."
,,,,,"I was surprised this place had a dedicated vegan menu. I'm usually happy if a restaurant has an obligatory singular vegan/veg item on the menu, but they had a separate vegan menu! It sounded like there was a dairy-free and gluten-free one as well."
,,,,,"I ordered the avocado crumpet over the house-made veggie burger by recommendation of the server. It did not disappoint!! The crumpet reminded me of fried sesame and scallion buns from chinese restaurants. If you look at the picture, you can't even see the crumpet because it's blanketed by generous amounts of avocado and colorful veggies and fresh herbs. Although flavors were predominantly Asian, the ""format"" of ingredients was certainly a new take for me. One order comes with three crumpets. I was only able to finish one."
,,,,,"The bf ordered Piggy goes to China. At a glance, it looks like a gourmet egg and sausage biscuit sandwich. The flavors on the other hand made this sandwich unique. I only tasted the sauce that was poured over the sandwich. It reminded me of a sweet dumpling dipping sauce with some szechuan peppers. The bf thoroughly enjoyed his order as ab open-faced sandwich & spared only the biscuit top."
,,,,,The server also surprised the bf with a bday milk shake complete with sprinkles! So nice!
,,,,,We'll definitely be coming back in our next trip!
,,,,,"Little Goat is a neat and trendy restaurant in Chicago. My friends and I found ourselves checking it out after seeing the amazing reviews on Yelp, and doing some quick googling to see what the hype was all about. After all of this, we had really built the place up and had pretty high expectations. "
,,,,,"When we arrived at the restaurant, it was close to peak brunch time, and we suffered the consequences! The place was packed and even the foyer was chock full of eager patrons. We were given an approximate wait time of 1 hour. After putting ourselves on the waitlist, we headed to Bombobar across the street and a nearby coffee shop to occupy ourselves in the meantime. (I will say that the automated waiting system that notifies you when your table is ready is fantastic.)"
,,,,,"We actually ended up getting spots in the restaurant about 25 minutes early, which was appreciated. There's a lot of cool stuff on the menu, interesting combinations and some rather intricate items, so step outside your comfort zone and try something new!"
,,,,,"Now for the not so great... Because it's so packed, Little Goat Diner has a large section of communal seating, and it's very tempting to take these seats as it decreases your wait time. However, we found that the general atmosphere of the restaurant is super loud, and the mechanics of sitting at a large communal table make it rather difficult to have a coherent conversation with the people in your party sitting across from you. Additionally, we found that though the food was interesting, and cool, the taste really wasn't that great. 4.5/5 for the hype and vibe, 3.5/5 for the food quality. "
,,,,,"Overall, Little Goat Diner is certainly a cool place to eat, but in a big city like Chicago, I think it's worth it to look for other options."
,,,,,"This place is delicious! Stopped by for lunch, and I was delighted! Big portions that we definitely could not finish at reasonable prices. "
,,,,,I had the chickpea salad with fried chicken I added. Fried chicken was delicious but not necessary. The salad has chickpeas as well as a softer falafel like ball as well. Delicious dressing and sauce  on the side if not enough. I added a biscuit($3) which looked big enough for two. Also had the sparkling rose($12) so good! 
,,,,,Additional recommendations:
,,,,,Pancakes 
,,,,,Cake is the day 
,,,,,Only hiccup was that I booked through yelp. When I arrived they had no record of me booking on file. If you book through yelp you may want to call and confirm. 
,,,,,Also love that it's female led!
,,,,,Bull's Eye French Toast really much delicious but when start and this will be finished quickly although very tasty.
,,,,,Amazing hashbrowns. 
,,,,,"We tried the bi bim bop breakfast bowl, Elvis waffle, oatmeal, hasbrowns, and special - crab rangoon. Elvis waffle and the hasbrowns were the standout dishes for sure."
,,,,,We got in without a wait on a Sunday morning around 9am but by 9:15 the place was packed. So definitely recommend getting there early on weekends.
,,,,,Parking is difficult to find in the area unless you pay the outrageous valet fees
,,,,,"Ok seriously, the hype is real and warranted!! "
,,,,,"Most of my 5 star reviews are for hole in the wall places, but Little Goat Diner is super popular and not extremely cheap and still warrants 5 stars based on the food alone. I ordered the bullseye toast and it was seriously the most delicious thing I've ever eaten for brunch - the fried chicken was perfect, and I usually find breakfast fried chicken too greasy or fried. This chicken was cut in bite-sized chunks and battered in a very flavorful and semi-sweet batter. The toast itself was perfection, as was of course the runny egg in the middle! "
,,,,,"We also ordered hash browns for the table, which were a perfect crispy consistency and the cheese was merged into the dish perfectly. My dining partners ordered the chocolate pancake and the...dish with smoked salmon I forget what it was called...and they both heartily enjoyed their dishes as well as their coffees with goat milk. "
,,,,,"Additional star for how cute the restaurant is, being able to make reservations easily on OpenTable, and for the wonderful service. A must try in the Goat Trifecta!"

,,,,,RATING: A+
,,,,,SERVICE: A
,,,,,AMBIANCE: A
,,,,,OVERVIEW: A
,,,,,"I was very excited when I found this gem across from Girl & Goat! It's always a pleasure try one of Stephanie Izards establishments in Chicago. My waiting for a table expectations were met upon arrival. There was definitely a long wait to be seated. I ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast and the Sloppy Goat. I was very excited to try something on the menu with the infamous GOAT. This sandwich hit flavor central on all levels. Something so simply was transformed into such a flavorful dish that drove my tastebuds crazy! The Bulls Eye French Toast was also absolutely out of this world! Their take on a classic chicken and waffles dish, made better with a sweet and buttery French toast. Check this spot out if you want to go to flavor town!"
,,,,,*A= Outstanding - D= Needs Improvement
,,,,,"I came here for brunch with a friend on a Saturday morning, and I was glad I made a reservation a few days before because it was packed! The atmosphere is perfect for a chill, informal meal with friends or family. "
,,,,,"Our server was prompt and nice, and she was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu. A lot of the menu items are a fusion of some breakfast food and some exotic/foreign food. "
,,,,,"I ordered This Little Piggy Went to China, which was delicious. It was slightly spicy, but not too much that it felt too much for brunch. It had that Sichuan-style pepper flavor that numbs your tongue, but it was very subtle. I also got a side of cheesy grits because I was feeling adventurous, and although nothing too special or flavorful (as grits are), it was delicious."
,,,,,"The everything is everything crumpets were amazing!! They were soft, buttery and melted in your mouth. The salmon was cooked well and the pickles on the side were a great touch. The paratha bread was definitely my favorite, though. The hot sauce is sooo good! For dessert, highly recommend the bulls eye French toast and if you're lucky enough to get them, the Ooey gooey Cinnabon (drooling as I write this) our sever Shane was wonderful. She was very sweet and down to earth. The vibe in this place is very mellow. Music is not too loud. And I love the added touch of the photobooth"
,,,,,Third time in and just as good as the other two. Last time I had an omelette with a cilantro cream cheese - was amazing! This time I had the gluten free bimibop bowl with cauliflower as base and bacon. So good! The sauce drizzled on top still made my low carb option glorious!
,,,,,"I had an early flight landed in Chicago. Needed breakfast badly and I knew I had to take this opportunity to visit one of Chef Stephanie Izard's restaurants while I'm in Chicago. We got there around 8:30am or so. Good thing we didn't need to wait in line because right after we got our table, people seemed to be lining up."
,,,,,"It's a cute/busy/casual/relaxing diner. There are tons of option on the menu which could be a bit overwhelming. We had no time to mess around, but to order quickly because we were starving. ""This little piggy went to China"" and ""Bi bim bop breakfast bowl"" were our choices. Bi bim bop was a bit of a let down, there wasn't anything spectacular about it compares to This little piggy. It lacked of different flavors. Everything felt like a one note on your palette. On the other hand, the cheddar biscuit and sichuan pork sausage with chili garlic chive sauce hit you like ..POW! Full of flavors. Although after a few bites, it got a tad salty for my taste bud. But it was still good nonetheless."
,,,,,Service was friendly. Coffee was so so. I wish I had the time to visit Girl & the Goat across the street.
,,,,,"This was recommended as a must to go in Chicago as one of Stephanie's restaurant. It did not disappoint! The diner is so cute large and open, we were seated pretty quickly on a weekday lunch time. I decided to stick with the theme and order a patty melt but with goat meat. I'm super picky with my gamey meats, but wow- beautifully done! It was the best patty melt of my life honestly. The scratch soda was a perfect compliment, and fries my god. Yeah I plan on eating here every time I come back to the city- I highly recommend!"
,,,,,"My friend and I went to Little Goat Diner for brunch on a Wednesday morning around 11:30 AM! I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes ($12), which were pretty good! There were 3 stacks in the pancakes. The menu said it was supposed to come with vanilla malt butter, but it didn't come with it, which wasn't a huge deal but still something to note. My friend ordered the Dark Chocolate Crunch Pancakes ($12) and did come with the chocolate malt butter. We also ordered the Pork Belly Home Fries, which were decent, but the pork was too salty for us. We didn't have to wait to be seated, and the service was good as well! Overall, while the pork belly was too salty and my pancakes didn't come with the butter as indicated, it was still pretty good, and I would probably come back again!"
,,,,,"Okay, it seems like everyone and their mommas have been to Little Goat Diner but me. Thankfully, a couple weeks back I had the chance to grab dinner with a friend here, to finally see what all of the buzz was about."
,,,,,"Aside from the ridiculously crowds that flock here on any given night, the diner had a sense of comfort that made you feel relaxed and welcomed. This place is interesting because, although it gives off that cheesy old school American diner vibe, on the inside (like, inside its menu and everything), you'll see how meticulously well-crafted some of these dishes are. Of course, this is a Top Chef contestant-led restarurant, so only the finest recipes and quality of dishes will be served here, but in a more casual design. Cute, isn't it?"
,,,,,"There were a lot of breakfast/brunch items on the menu, so I decided to go with this Little Piggy Went to Chinatown dish featuring a sunnyside egg on top of a delicious southern biscuits and some assorted spices and toppings that I can't recall at the moment. Anyways, the food was brilliant! Very rich flavors, and even with somewhat of a steep price, the portion size was satisfiable. "
,,,,,"There's also dessert available here, so I wanted to try their Mexican Coke shake...but they had no Coke available (really!?). Ah well, despite all that, it was an enjoyable meal. "
,,,,,"Make a reservation when you want to come here. Even on a Tuesday evening, we were barely able to score a seat and had to settle for sitting on the barstools. Still, the experience was worth it, and I'm glad I got a piece of the Little Goat, finally."
,,,,,"The food is disgusting. There are no healthy options on the menu. The unhealthy options are made even more unhealthy. The nachos were extremely greasy and oily and absolutely covered with cheese and grease. The burgers were horrible. So salty, dry, and had a thick bitter crust like the grill has never been cleaned. And it's expensive. I have no clue how there are good reviews and people inside - the food is really really bad."
,,,,,"This place has tasty diner food. I got a club sandwich, no mayo. It was good. My drink was good too but it didn't come with ice. I think the drink would have been better with ice but that's just my preference."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Girl and the goat quality but in breakfast/Asian flavors and a much cheaper bill! 
,,,,,"We shared the goat chili cheese fries, okonomiyaki, and the this little piggy went to China. All were great but the okonomiyaki was the standout!"
,,,,,"The goat chili cheese fries have thin fries smothered in a light creamy cheese sauce and goat chili. Definitely would recommend, doesn't look super pretty but great flavor. "
,,,,,The okonomiyaki was SO good! It's a Japanese savory pancake that's crisp and greasy on the outside and light and fluffy inside. The only (very minor) downside was it's supposed to have pork belly but didn't get that flavor at all - still great! 
,,,,,The little piggy went to China is very Instagram worthy with a big sunny side egg on top. I liked the dish but the individual components were just a bit bland. The sauce tries to make up for it by being too aggressive and salty but makes it hard to eat the biscuit soaking it up.
,,,,,Booked this place because we thought we couldn't get reservations for Girl and the Goat down the street (we were able to try that too actually!). Brightly lit with a diner hustle-and-bustle feel. I did want a booth but all they had was counter space at the time of our reservation. Oh well.
,,,,,"I will admit the first few minutes were rocky. No one greeted us for like 15 minutes after we sat down, considering we were sitting right at the bar in front of 100000 of the staff. Someone did stop by to give us water... 15 minutes later."
,,,,,"We ordered the The Little Piggy Went to China and a grilled cheese w/ their apple tomato soup. They informed me they were out of the adult grilled cheese as they stopped carrying the bread? They replaced it with the kids one, which had gruyere and I added ham. This was just as good especially dipped in the tomato soup. yummm. The Little Piggy Went to China resembled a Korean seafood pancake. They had the takoyaki flakes on top too, it was super good! "
,,,,,The service did get better after some time. (-:
,,,,,Great decor. 
,,,,,Really well executed food that is super tasty. 
,,,,,"Helpful, fast service. "
,,,,,"My wife is a huge fan of Girl and the Goat, so we were really excited to try LGD. "
,,,,,Right off the bat the decor and styling of the restaurant is just plain fun. It felt like a combination of a classic diner and my grandmother's kitchen. 
,,,,,We started with the Crisp Shrimp Cocktail. This was a surprising and original take on a classic. The ramen wrapping gave the shrimp a great crunch - while the lettuce and cocktail sauce wrapped everything together perfectly. 
,,,,,My wife and I decided to split the Tonkatsu sandwich and the Patty Melt. 
,,,,,"The Tonkatsu was incredibly savory. The pork was nice and crispy, but still juicy. The combination of the of mayo, cabbage and bbq sauce was the perfect topping. And putting the whole thing inbetween classic white bread was just fun. I would order this again in a moment. "
,,,,,"But for me, the real star was the Patty Melt. It was ooey, gooey, juicy, cheesey, crispy and all-around delicious. While each of the components of this sandwich was high-quality, it was the execution that really made it shine. The LGD team took a classic (the Patty Melt) and nailed it. They didn't feel the need to do anything crazy with it - they simply took a classic sandwich and did it perfectly. "
,,,,,I hope to be back to LGD soon!
,,,,,Best dinner in Chicago!!
,,,,,Creative menu with AMAZING staff who will accommodate any allergies. 
,,,,,"We both loved everything we ate and felt like we left stuffed, but still enjoyed it all.  "
,,,,,"If you see a special that sounds good, definitely try it, because those are often the best!"
,,,,,"It's a fun environment, the staff and service are great. The menu offers a creative spin on trusted standard offerings. They are able to make a selection of the menu veg or vegan which is appreciated. Order the chickpea salad - you won't regret it!"
,,,,,Hi Catherine! Thank you for taking the time to leave all of us at Little Goat your exceptional review! Hearing that your visit with our staff was great lets us know that we are making all the right moves. We will be sure to give your compliments to the chef. Please feel free to stop by again!
,,,,,I got the corned beef hash. And tried the smoked fries too. They taste like barbeque potato chips! Everything was all around delicious. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable which won me over. Would love to go again and try some of their other menu items.
,,,,,"Such a cute little snack spot. We stopped for a coffee, mocha, and light bites. We were able to sit outside in their ample seating and enjoy some mask free time in a safe, socially distanced area. The staff were friendly and engaging."
,,,,,"So I'm from out of town, and my brother brought me here because it's one of his favorite lunch spots. We made a reservation and got seated right away. After waiting for a while - we were chatting and didn't realize we'd been neglected - the manager came by and apologized for our wait. He was incredibly friendly and gave us the best customer service! He helped us decide on our sandwiches and not only did he comp our appetizer - he sent over a large ice cream sundae too! A huge thanks to him for taking care of us! "
,,,,,P.S. I recommend the fat club if you're hungry- what a sandwich!!
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner got some big number reviews! Came with my fam and group of awesome friends visiting Chiraq. Got to sample the little piggy and the special omelette of the day consisting of roast beef and horse radish. In addition, our party ordered a side cinnamon buns to try. "
,,,,,"Them buns were warm and the icing was awesome. Had a cream cheese kind of taste for the icing as it oozes and trickled on the sides. Sadly wasn't too impressed with the omelet. Had some fried onions on top which was a nice texture but the roast beef didn't really taste like anything amazing. Literally tasted like the Golden Corral pot roast. No lie bruh. The Little Piggy going to China was an interesting attempt for an Asian fusion dish. However, I think the fish sauce was just over powering. Killed the biscuit for me as it absorbed that sauce. "
,,,,,"Overall, the atmosphere was good. Food fell a little short for the price in my eyes. Maybe Asian fusion not my roll."
,,,,,"I tend to be skeptical when a popular restaurant opens up a spin-off, especially one so close by such that it almost seems to be a consolation prize for those who weren't able to get a reservation to the OG. "
,,,,,"But we were so impressed by the Girl and the Goat, we were curious to explore Stephanie Izard's second project. The menu is brimming with character, full of cute pictures and whimsical names such as ""Cereal killers"" for the breakfast section. "
,,,,,"Some fusion items (read: pork belly with scallion pancakes and bok choy salad) may sound like a hodgepodge to purists, but the Little Goat does a fine job creating a carefully orchestrated mashup of Asian influences with traditional diner food. I do wish there were more goat items, but there were enough intriguing menu choices that ordering was a difficult enough decision."
,,,,,"I usually do not order grilled cheese at restaurants as it's fool-proof comfort food that can't really go wrong, but the Little Goat's GRILLED CHEESE ($13) was quite exceptional. The blend of gjetost (goat cheese) and cheddar was full-bodied and unique but not overwhelming. The filling was interspersed with savory guanciale (an Italian cured meat), compounded with bacon gouda bread grilled to the perfect crisp, finished off with apple-tomato relish as a curve-ball--a little sweet and almost a teaser as homage to the Chicago deep dish. (Either that or I'm just over-interpreting my grilled cheese)."
,,,,,"Boo is a burger fan and got the CHOP CHAE ($13) under the burger section, though there was no warning that the burger arrives deconstructed. It was more of a patty with a egg over a blend of japchae noodles, assorted Asian vegetables, and umami mayo. Though the burger patty was somewhat dry, overall I was quite impressed that they pulled off a japchae burger. "
,,,,,"The ambiance is a modern take on the traditional diner, with neutral tones and trendy furniture replacing the traditional red bar stools and checkered patterns. Service was friendly, and the wait on a Saturday night wasn't as ridiculous as some other places around the area. Overall, I enjoyed our visit to the Little Goat, a memorable dining experience with an upscale, global interpretation of diner classics."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Overrated. Good!! Excellent food, there is no doubt. However, it's what it is - an overpriced diner with a nice atmosphere and old school ambiance. "
,,,,,Would go back for the butterscotch soda. 1000%
,,,,,"Upon recommendation by my Chicago-resident cousin, a group of 5 of us showed up around 1:15 PM on Monday afternoon. There was a wait (on a Monday?! intense!), so we strolled around the West Loop for about 45 minutes until we were called to be seated. Upon arrival, we were placed at one end of a long communal table. The space is pretty loud, so it was a bit hard to hear each other at times. The place is diner-chic with a variety of seating including bar stools & booths as well as a photo booth near the entrance."
,,,,,"Yes way, breakfast all day! Most dishes are classic American with an ethnic twist. I ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China, which is a sesame cheddar biscuit cut in half with the bottom piece topped with savory Sichuan pork sausage and a sunny egg. The chili garlic chive sauce and greens added unexpected flavors that went together tremendously well. If you're looking to kick it up even more, ask for bottles of their house-made hot sauces (which come in hot & very hot). The dish also comes with some blackberries which look lovely and add a tart sweetness to balance it all out. Our table also shared the pork belly home fries which were savory and delicious, especially with that hot sauce."
,,,,,"This really is ideal brunch fare in my opinion! Little Goat is super tasty, unique, and fun! The only reason I'm docking a star is due to the service. Simply put, our waiter had a 'tude. When I asked which kombucha there was, he said they were out. No apologizing or offering of alternatives. They were also out of goat milk for the latte. He didn't come by to check on us (even when my friend was trying to flag him down to order a drink) and just seemed like he didn't want to deal with us at all. When he came at the end to collect our payment, we handed him our 5 cards and asked if he could split it. He scoffed ""I guess"" and rolled his eyes. So unnecessary. I guess it's better that he didn't come around often, so we weren't as affected by his negativity. I just don't understand how you can be so disinterested when you're surrounded by all of this delicious food!"
,,,,,"Ok, so I will say some places truly do live up to its hype. Well done Little Goat you do live up to the reputation. "
,,,,,Stephanie Izard's version of 'diner' with eclectic ingredients still manages to make dishes familiar enough and very delicious. 
,,,,,Sloppy goat with a slight tang (pickled peppers & coleslaw) with soft brioche bun definitely had delicious game! 
,,,,,"Baked crab dip with Ritz crackers, Pork belly home fries, honey yogurt with house granola was out of this world delicious. Thick yogurt with moderate sweetness perfectly complimented the flavor. Root beer float was also a nice touch."
,,,,,"When in area and looking for a lighter flare, this place is a must try."
,,,,,"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast/lunch locations! But I almost gave them 4 stars for removing my favorite ""this little piggy went to China!"" Bring it back or the next review will be four stars lol. Also they don't currently have the dining inside open so plan ahead during COVID-19"
,,,,,"I'm going to be honest: This is my least favorite of the Izard restaurants and since she's my favorite chef in Chicago, it hurts me to say that because I want all of her places to be equally bad ass.  "
,,,,,"Came in solo and figured I had to get the popular ""Little Piggy went to ""China"" dish to start off with.  Delicious, nice portion but entirely too salty, even with the gooseberries.  The flavors though, were amazing and at a bite or two this dish is really unstoppable.  The biscuit was crispy, the sausage juicy and the egg was textbook.  But after a few bites in, the savoriness overpowered all other flavors for me.  "
,,,,,"Along with that, I ordered the okonomiyaki, which said in the menu description, ""Osaka street food with pork belly, wanna know more?!""  Being a huge fan of pork belly I knew I was going to love it...Except it didn't have any actual pork belly in it.  When I asked the waitress she said the pork belly is more used ""for flavoring"" the pancake batter.  No, I'm a glutton and I want something with actual pork and expressed my disappointment to her.  She was kind enough to replace it with the pork belly pancake which did indeed come with a fat slab of meat.  This was easily my favorite dish of the night.  Extremely rich and hitting all of the textures that one could ask for, it was the perfect guilty pleasure dish for me.  The slaw that comes on top was lighter, which is needed to offset the heaviness of the Chinese pancake and fatty meat.  Finally, if you've been to Girl and the Goat and have tried the broccoli there you'll know that it's an insane dish and can easily stand on its own.  Having similar hopes, I tried the ""Not Chinese Broccoli"" here and was really disappointed.  You get a handful of broccoli and a Asiany sauce and that's about it.  Completely not worth the $8.  "
,,,,,"This restaurant is not bad, it just does not compare to Girl and the Goat or Duck Duck Goat.  Like her other restaurants, however, the service was wonderful but it lacked a level of balance in the food that the other places have.  There's still Cabra to try!"
,,,,,This was a late night stop after hitting some local bars.  
,,,,,"We had the grilled cheese, the piggies went to China, and the fat Elvis waffle "
,,,,,"The grilled cheese was definitely interesting, very satisfying after a night of drinking- salty and cheesy. "
,,,,,"The waffle was not that great. It was kind of plain, and lacking 'something'. "
,,,,,"the service was quick, and it was basically empty, as we were the last ones to leave. - sorry hah"
,,,,,"The place is very beautiful, classic diner vibes with an upscale touch."
,,,,,"Had a really great experience here at Little Goat Diner, they have a retro modernized diner, great atmosphere, and their place is so decorated. Their employees are so excellent, super friendly, and helpful. All of them are so professional and decent, you can easily ask one of them to get what you need in their kitchen, like extra water, sauce, condiments, and others. Always appreciate their service and their phenomenal food as well. Their food never disappoints you every time you visit there and you will probably go and visit again. Their place has a great atmosphere, it is so huge, and elegant. All of their customers are comfortable with their place, including me. I am really amazed with the service they have as well as their foods. Will always come back here and also will explore their menu. Highly recommend this store to all of you and try to stop by so that you can also enjoy their wonderful service. I will also introduce this to all of my friends and family so that next time I visit I am with them also. Thank you for great experience Little Goat Diner. And also for a great customer service. Good job guys! Keep up the good work. Thank you."
,,,,,Hi Sia - Reviews like this one make our day! We are thrilled to hear that our service stands out to you and we truly appreciate your kind words about our team. We also love that you come back to Little Goat time and time again. Thank you so much for your continued support! We hope that you have a great weekend.
,,,,,"Food was DELICIOUS! The diner itself is also very very cute; I appreciate how varied the menu was, it made it hard to choose! I love asian food so the blend of american with asian staples was cool. My favorite dish we ordered was probably the fish tostadas or the goat curry; the curry was pretty salty, but tasted really unique! I'm only giving it 4 stars because the service was not super attentive, maybe because it was super busy. But we had to wait a reeeally long time to order and get our waiter's attention. But highly recommend as the Fulton area is wonderful for nice dinners!!"
,,,,,"I met a friend at Little Goat on a weekday morning and we had a great time. Considering the wait is typically a few hours, it was lovely to walk in and have the place mostly empty. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast and it was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I've really had never anything like it, and their menu was full of unique dishes that I'd love to come back for. "
,,,,,"If you're in the West Loop neighborhood and can avoid the wait, I'd highly recommend Little Goat for a fun brunch experience."
,,,,,"Strictly on food, it's A-OK. It pains me to say this being a huge Stephanie Izard fan but the Bull's Eye French Toast was so mediocre. The syrup and flavors was really sweet and I didn't get too much of the savory from the fried chicken pieces and the fried egg. The strawberries didn't fit with the rest of the bread, the chicken, and egg and it was just a strange combination. I felt the service was good and they guided me towards the most popular dishes. If I came back, I would try the other dishes on the menu. That said, I would also rather just go to Girl and the Goat or try out Duck Duck Goat instead. I am not giving up on Chef Izard just yet but I'd suggest trying to get to Girl and the Goat before coming here. Sorry..."

,,,,,"Breakfast lover? You have to try Little Goat Diner! This place has a nice unique spin on classic breakfast entrees, as well as other yummy entrees you could eat all day. There is indoor and outdoor seating which is nice, but they get packed so make a reservation! "
,,,,,"We started off with the ooey gooey cinnabun and it tastes just as amazing as it sounds! My group decided to share all of our entrees so we can get a taste of everything, which I totally recommend doing. The corned beef is a classic, you can't really go wrong there. To mix it up, we tried the little piggy goes to China and we all thought it would be the perfect breakfast for a hangover, it had a nice Asian infused taste with a delicious biscuit. To end we got the creole chicken sammy and a side of pork belly home fries. Both were great, but those home fries were a show stopper to me! Potatoes were so crispy and that pork belly was soooo tasty."
,,,,,"Little Goat does not want our business. :-( THIRD time we've gone there to find them closing early. Hours listed as 8:00-8:00 and we arrived this week at 1:00 to find plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. Host said they had no tables. I asked if all tables were reserved - no. Asked to be put on wait list - no. Asked if they ran out of food - no. He said they were going to close early at 2:00 and I said we'll be done well before 2:00 - no dice. He said they preferred to be ""overly cautious"" so we were out of luck. Overly cautious about what? Covid? We were fully masked and they'd been open all day by that point! The guy was visibly delighted to turn us away. A real tool and Goat really needs to work on its service game."
,,,,,"We're so sorry to have missed you a third time. This is never the outcome we want for our guests, and we sincerely apologize that this experience has left you with a negative feeling. We will address this feedback with the appropriate personnel to ensure we're delivering the warmest and most accommodating care we can, but if you'd like to have a conversation, our Assistant Director of Operations, Tina Majethia, would be glad to discuss your concerns. We really hope we get the chance to dine with you soon. Be well."
,,,,,"Quick service, flavorful and interesting fusion brunch options, and bright, welcoming atmosphere. Definitely plan to come back on my next sojourn in Chicago. "
,,,,,"10/10 recommend the Los Drowned. Beautiful sandwich with melt-in-your-mouth slow cooked pork, cabbage slaw, and soft, homemade bread with just the right amount of outer crunch. Great portion size for a hungry diner. "
,,,,,"This Little Pig Went to China was also good, didn't blow me away to be honest. The biscuit was flavorful but seemed overly salty and fatty (the edges soaked up a lot of oil), not fluffy like I'd expect from a southern style biscuit. The egg and pork sausage were savory and provided interesting texture, and overall, if I was only moderately hungry, this would have been satisfying. "
,,,,,I had a great experience here and look forward to returning soon!
,,,,,"I came here for a late breakfast on a Wednesday with a friend. Even though it was around 10:30AM on a weekday, this place was packed. Fortunately this had no effect on our service, as our waitress was very attentive and speedy with our orders. "
,,,,,"I got the Spanish omelette, which was filled with cheese, onions, and peppers and drenched in a chunky salsa over  masa chips. The chips were pretty soggy underneath all that sauce, and I would probably do without those next time. "
,,,,,"Otherwise, the omelette was pretty solid. But the best part of the meal was by far the Bloody Mary I ordered. It was massive, boozy, spicy, and so delicious. By the time I finished it, I couldn't care less if I had enjoyed the omelette or not. "
,,,,,"Over all, it was a pleasant brunch with 10/10 drinks. I would come back if only for that bloody."
,,,,,"Great spot for a quick weekend brunch. Very friendly staff and good service. We ordered breakfast and enjoyed our food, it was very delicious and they are very accommodating to special requests. Overall, liked this spot and would definitely go back. Would love to try their sandwiches soon, they all sounded delicious as well."
,,,,,"My fam acme into town and i had no idea where to take them. Inline their reservations were booked out, but when i called they were great and got us a reservation! This was honestly the BEST sandwich i have ever had. The sammi was great, the chips were amazing, and the staff were super kind!"
,,,,,It's amazing to hear that you had the best sandwich ever here with us at Little Goat. Thanks for taking your folks here to eat. We appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,Wow! Incredible. My husband and I went here today after a recommendation from a friend. We are visiting Chicago for the weekend. 
,,,,,We made a 9:30 reservation for breakfast and we're so glad that we did as it was packed when we got there. We started the meal off with a cappuccino and a cold brewed coffee and then my husband had the biscuits and gravy and I had the shrimp and grits. Each were delicious and satisfied us after a night out. 
,,,,,I was pleasantly surprised that the shrimp and grits were not extremely heavy and also that they grits were not overly cheesy. The flavors worked well together and I loved that this pistachios. 
,,,,,"My husband was worried about the mushrooms in the gravy as he's not a big fan of them, however it was not overpowering and worked beautifully. "
,,,,,We absolutely will come back on our next trip to Chicago!
,,,,,"The ambiance is great but the food wasn't as good as I expected. Our server did a great job of talking about it, but it really was not that great when it came. Hashbrowns were mostly white-- under cooked-- and the Japanese dish I got was pretty bland. The fruit cup was pedestrian, and the corned beef hash was mediocre.  My daughter had a burrito which she was very happy with. I think if there were more vegetables and less stodgy white carbs with each entree it might be better."
,,,,,I died and went to heaven. I've seen Izard on everything but haven't had the opportunity to eat her food until today--and it thankfully lived up to the hype! 
,,,,,Hash browns: This had all the best parts of a hash brown I love and none of the mediocre part. You know how most places make hash browns crispy on the outside and slightly soggy/wet on the inside? This had a satisfying crispy crunch for every single bite. 
,,,,,"French toast: If you love sweet and savory (or fried chicken and waffles), you'll want to order this. The yolky over soft egg in the middle surprised me and I wiped it up with the chicken and brioche! I kept the strawberries away from the yolk though bc that's a little beyond me. "
,,,,,"Falafel salad: I am not a salad person but wow. We needed some roughage and saw great reviews for this, and it did not disappoint! The falafel was flavorful and fluffy. The salad was hearty with kale. And the pickled onions added much needed bites of acidity."
,,,,,"Honest review: not good ik i didnt try alot of things but the things we tried were bad n nothing on the menu looks interesting enough to come back everything was really acidic. Service: didnt like it, its like bar service. "
,,,,,Goat almighty: didnt like it. The patty was tiny dry n not flavorful. The bbq pork wasn't flavorful n was cold. theres a lot of acidity from the burger like from the pickles n other things. The beef was tasty but wasnt hot. The only part of the burger i liked wss the onion rings they were delish. 
,,,,,Home fries: didnt like these at all idk why there was an unappealing acidic flavor.Then fries werent crispy. The bacon was good though

,,,,,"Little Goat is a cute little diner with fantastic food.  Make sure to make reservations so you don't have to wait.  When we went, there was a very long line for walk-ins.  There is also a little bakery that sells cakes, cookies, scones, pies, etc.  We ate at the diner.  "
,,,,,"Favorite was the hot crab dip.  It has cheesy crab with ritz crackers.  It's super cheesy and delicious.  We also liked the goat chili cheese fries, which were smothered in creamy cheese and chives.  Crispy shrimp cocktail was also good - the shrimp come in lettuce wraps with a cocktail sauce.  The Reuben was great - corned beef, kimchi, kraut, havarti and a delicious sauce.  "
,,,,,Service was great.  It's got a super friendly vibe.  Prices are very reasonable.  Would definitely come back here.
,,,,,"I was excited to come here, but left super dissatisfied."
,,,,,The waitress was nice and described the dishes well. So service wasn't that bad.
,,,,,"I think the AC isn't as great by the counter space since there was 90 degree weather outside. I felt so hot but I am sure that's because the kitchen is right in front of us. I thought it was weird that they didn't give ice water. It was water in a pouring jug under the counter space. The seats were pretty uncomfortable, too. Our seats were kinda loose."
,,,,,"I looked at the menu and a lot of it I wasn't feeling. It's got a lot of Asian flavors, some Mexican flavors on top of trying to give diner dishes. So it was hard for me to decide on something because there was one flavor I felt like was out of place. I finally decided on the Bull's Eye French Toast with a side of hash browns. I love brioche toast and the chicken sounded good so I went for it. I really liked that the egg was inside of the toast. It was a pleasant surprise and softened up the toast nicely too! I did find that the strawberries on top of the chicken was weird. The sugared strawberries were wilted and stained my chicken. It was weird because I didn't want to eat strawberry flavored chicken. I guess it makes sense to put the strawberries on the chicken on the toast because where else would it go, but it certainly did not make the eating experience taste better."
,,,,,"Also, they completely forgot my hash browns. The cheese inside hash browns sounded good, but I didn't get that when they finally bought out my hash browns. I'm glad they said it was on the house, though. Since I already had finished half my french toast by the time the hash browns came so I barely touched the hash browns."
,,,,,"This is my first time trying a restaurant in the Stephanie Izard empire and I'm not as impressed. I'm less likely to want to want to come back to this place and I don't have a desire to try her other restaurants. Although, if I am able to grab a decent reservation time for her other restaurants then maybe I would try the rest."
,,,,,"Took a trip to Chicago for vacation, my friend and I had a reservation here for brunch at 11:30 on a Monday. "
,,,,,"While not packed, it was still busy I'd say for a Monday. Service was great, the staff was really friendly and helpful. We ordered the nachos, okonomiyaki, an iced latte, and cappuccino. The menu had such a diverse range of options and some of the most unique brunch dishes I've come across. There were dishes inspired from many different cultures (Mexican, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc.). It was hard to choose!"
,,,,,Food came out super quickly. The okonomiyaki was INCREDIBLE. It was basically just a bunch of Japanese sauces and flavors all thrown on an Asian style pancake. The flavor was so savory. The nachos were huge and a great portion. 
,,,,,"Our coffee didn't end up coming until after our food, but the staff was really apologetic about it."
,,,,,I would definitely come back to try other dishes
,,,,,"Brunch was delicious except for the bland chai latte I had. I was a bit hesitant about the menu. There were many fusion style dishes from different cultural foods. Normally, I don't enjoy fusion food for chefs often miss the mark, but some of these dishes were surprisingly delicious! I had the Pork Belly Pancake, which was really a scallion pancake with pork belly on top and Cole salad with ginger dressing. I was blown away! Highly recommend it. My boyfriend had the french toast with chicken and BBQ maple syrup, it was really good! Lastly, our friend ordered the brambleberry pancakes! They were delicious!"
,,,,,"People are pleasant, ooey gooey cinnamon rolls are sugary deliciousness, and the food is amazing. It's classics with a twist. My grilled cheese came out with some tapanade and pork in it, a beautiful blend of flavors. The hot chocolate had a fun design on the top of it. The decor was simple, the tables clean, and the bathrooms are 5 single stalls, 3 gender neutral."
,,,,,"I will definitely go back. It isn't a diner, it's amazing."
,,,,,"This is hands down one of my favorite spots for a meal in Chicago. I love the diner vibe and that you can get breakfast, lunch or dinner! They have delicious cocktails as well, but definitely not a place for bottomless brunch.  Little Goat updates their menu to incorporate seasonal ingredients, so the food always tastes fresh!"
,,,,,Great casual spot with an amazing breakfast menu. It can be hard to get a table but it's worth the wait.
,,,,,"Got here at 8am on a Friday morning, there was no wait. By the time we left around 9-9:30, there was a slight wait, maybe 2-3 small groups waiting for tables. Also, keep in mind that parking right outside the restaurant appears to be valet/loading only. You'll have to use side streets if you're looking for street parking. The Morgan stop is also somewhat close to the restaurant if you're up for public transport. I love the fusion concepts, the menu always sounds interesting, and it takes great creativity, confidence, and know-how to be able to pull these dishes off. But I do think that the flavors are a bit overpowering and not exactly balanced."
,,,,,"Got the cinnamon roll, which was good, fresh, but wasn't out of this world. The icing is what helped, the actual cinnamon roll itself was not as fluffy or chewy as I thought it would be based on reviews."
,,,,,"Corned beef hash was good; the corned beef was a bit leaner than expected. Still tender, but not as tender as it usually is when it's a bit fattier, but hey, maybe it's healthier! It's a grown up, classed up version of corned beef hash, so it just depends on whether you're looking for that."
,,,,,"Also got the Little Piggy Went to China dish and it was pretty overpowering. The sauce on it was very acidic, I could barely taste the biscuit or the egg because of the sauce. All in all, this dish was my least favorite and I would not recommend it just because of how imbalanced it was, it took over my taste buds for the remainder of the meal. But this is a very popular dish, so it must have its merits as well!"

,,,,,"I love Stephanie Izard and really wish I could go to Girl and the Goat, but since I was alone, I opted for the diner. I was so excited to come here. I arrived at around 2pm. It was fairly quiet since the lunch crowd had died and I was seated at the counter. "
,,,,,"I sat there for a while trying to decide what I wanted... everything looked so good. I wanted to do the chicken + waffles combo (not the Bullseye French Toast) but figured that it was going to be way too much food so opted for the fried chicken + chili cheese fries. After seeing the giant portions of the fried chicken coming out for other tables, I asked if it was possible to change to the Bullseye French Toast instead. My waitress was extremely accommodating and put in the french toast for me. "
,,,,,"My cheese fries came out first. I have to admit, I am not the biggest fan of chili since I don't really like beans... so I don't know why I ordered it, but I couldn't resist cheese fries. However, the fries were extremely skinny, and the cheese was a melted fancy cheese... so I didn't get the same satisfaction I normally get from salty fries with fake melted nacho cheese. As much as I enjoy fancy food, I learned that I do not enjoy fancy cheese fries. "
,,,,,"My french toast came out next. It's their twist on chicken and waffles. The french toast had 2 eggs fried on top. The syrup was already poured on but I like that it didn't drench my bread and made it soggy. The chicken was cut up chicken tenders. It was already coated in syrup so aside from tasting sweet, I didn't taste much else."
,,,,,I got a Los Drowned and the Not Chinese broccoli to go to eat at the hotel. Someone else ate the sandwich and I ate the Not Chinese Broccoli. It was a couple pieces of broccoli coated in something similar to the sweet chili sauce. Not $7. 
,,,,,I was fairly disappointed because I think I hyped it up too much in my head. Although if I lived in the area I'd definitely like to try the entire menu and see whether it was just what I ordered that was disappointing.
,,,,,"A big group of my friends and I tried going to Au Cheval and The Girl and the Goat, but we were turned away from both places since the wait was going to be 2 hours at 8 PM on a Saturday.  The waiter suggested that we go to Little Goat Diner, so we did and came in with a party of 12 and was seated right away.  "
,,,,,"The food has a bit of asian fusion, and I thought the food here was really well-seasoned and flavorful.  The chef that controls all these restaurants is somewhat of a genius.  The group around me split a nachos, which was awesome (get it) and I got the Tonkatsu sammich.  One of my friends got the goat allmighty burger, and as it came out, I became immediately jealous.   Tonkatsu wasn't a bad choice either.  The pork was tender and the sauce that came with the sammich was on point!"

,,,,,Amazing highly recommend their bulls eye French toast. There was a poached egg in the middle of their toast!! And the fried chicken and strawberries were killer on top. 
,,,,,Their classic sundae was delicious as well. The chocolate syrup was like brownie syrup. It was grainy but in the same way that brownie batter is. I'm a sucker for sweet stuff though. 
,,,,,Update: patty melt is really good! Cinnamon bun is also good. Bibimbap wasn't my cup of tea but it was still okay.

,,,,,"For how busy the restaurant was, the service was super good! Overall, the food was delicious, but I don't think it lives up to the hype of having to get a reservation 1 week in advance, but that's just me. If you like breakfast food, I would highly recommend giving this place a try! "
,,,,,"I got the Bullseye French Toast and it was unlike any breakfast food I have ever had. I'm definitely more of a chicken and waffles kind of a girl, but the homemade maple syrup was to die for!"
,,,,,"I've been here every time I visit Chicago and this place never fails.  Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of the food because I was too hungry.  The pancakes are a must try.  It's always fluffy and delicious.  I also recommend the grilled cheese sandwich.  It's my personal favorite.  Service is always great.  Of course, the Bloody Mary is a must for brunch."
,,,,,"I love the feel of this diner, as it straddles a 50's diner but modernized and with lots of natural light. We were seated at a small table, but I didn't feel too crowded next to my neighbor."
,,,,,"First up, I ordered the sesame milk latte. I have to say, this tasted horrible. The first sip, I grimaced and it had a weird salty flavor. However, my meal got better when I saw they had omonoyaki on the menu which is a unique Japanese food that consists of a poached egg, cabbage flour and vegetables and meat. I have never seen this dish outside of Japan. "
,,,,,"I was a little hesitant to order it, but decided to go forward anyway when the waitress assured me Japanese customers confirmed it was authentic. Pleasantly surprised when it came with little Tempura crunches on top. It was very tasty and I could not figure out what it reminded me of, until it struck me--It tasted exactly like the fried dough of takoyaki (fried batter with octopus in the middle minus the octopus)"
,,,,,"My friend ordered crumpets which came with lox, cream cheese, pickled onions and egg salad. Very unique fusion food! The waitress was also friendly and very knowledgeable about the dishes and the ingredients."
,,,,,"If it wasn't for my strange latte, this would have been a 5 Star experience. Definitely go, if you get a chance!"
,,,,,"Been dying to come here since Stephanie Izard had won her respective season of Top Chef. Finally got the chance to do so when I was revisiting Chicago along with the bf and a friend last month. I'm glad we had made a reservation to come here in advance, because even though it was during the day on a Monday, the place was pretty packed and soon after we had arrived, a line had formed outside."
,,,,,"I had an order of their parathas burrito and we also got a side of crumpets to share. The burrito was delicious: the eggs and bean salad was definitely more Mexican in flavor profile, but the chili pepper sauce and the paratha wrap was obviously more Indian. The crumpets were unfortunately a tad too greasy for me, but the strawberry rhubarb spread it came with was delicious. "
,,,,,"Service was pretty attentive and the interior is super cute, as is the giant little (oxymoron, anybody?) rotating goat on the roof of the establishment. I'm very glad we got the chance to come here and would come back here in a heartbeat if I happened to find myself in Chicago ago."
,,,,,"Great food, great staff, but weirdly long wait. And I'm not just talking about getting inside--once you've ordered things took a bunch longer than they should have."
,,,,,"However, the french dip inspired sandwich was truly inspired. Everyone in my group got something different and they were all gems."
,,,,,"Every time I go to Little Goat, I come optimistic that I'm going to have a great meal. And, unfortunately, every time I'm disappointed.  Last time I went, I got the chicken tacos. The meal didn't feel cohesive or well thought through. The flavor was bland, and while I'm by no means a chef, feel I would have been better off making my own food at home."
,,,,,"I do appreciate the measures they're taken throughout COVID. The distanced benches and ordering window is a fun way to maintain social distancing while still getting a dining out experience. It's a great atmosphere to get a drink and enjoy the West Loop, though I wouldn't bother with the food with so many other options in the area."
,,,,,"Very fun vibe, but very unfortunately fails to deliver in food."
,,,,,Sitting at the counter watching the frenzied chefs in the kitchen cranking out perfect dish after perfect dish is a lot like watching an episode of Top Chef. But it's also a lot like being in a tile box with 150 people screaming to be heard... because that's exactly what it is.
,,,,,"Somewhere along the line restaurant designers decided that people wanted to eat in a loud environment because it made them feel like they were in a happening scene. They achieved this by not bothering to hire acoustic engineers. But even an authentic diner doesn't have that kind of ambiance. It's a place where you can hear the rattle of cutlery, and the waitress chatting up the regulars. There's certainly no chance of that here."
,,,,,"But the food is wonderful. Each dish is Stephanie Izard's take on traditional cuisine, with her own twists. And those twists are exceptional."
,,,,,Okonomiyaki is a wonderful Japanese breakfast pancake/egg dish with a delicious combination of savory sauces and crunchy bits to add texture.
,,,,,"Tempura fried mashed potatoes are light, with a perfectly crisp and not oily shell."
,,,,,"And One Twisted Sundae is a decadent sweet/salty combination of pretzel ice cream, caramel sauce, and whipped cream."
,,,,,"There are an interesting cocktail menu and a limited selection of beer and wine, but if you want to go authentic you can choose from fountain drinks, shakes and floats."
,,,,,I guess the service is good. I couldn't hear well enough to tell.
,,,,,In the mood for a diner experience but with a more elevated palate? This place is the place to be! Obsessed with their grilled cheese with olives. So innovative - puts a great modern touch on such a classic.
,,,,,"After loving our dining experience at Girl and the Goat and hearing good things about Little Goat Diner we decided to try LGD for brunch. We couldn't get reservations for our large party so initially we came on a Friday, but after being quoted a wait time of 60 minutes we decided to go down the street instead of waiting for our table. Come to find out later, that it was ready just 3 minutes later. So we decided to try again Saturday morning knowing the wait time would probably be longer. We were right, they quoted us an hour to 90 minutes for our party of 9. However, 25 minutes later we got the text that our table was ready! We were happily surprised to see they pad their wait times so drastically, but it's well worth putting your name down and hanging out in the area."
,,,,,"The diner itself is open, bright and spacious. All the employees are really friendly as well. We started our meal off with mimosa carafes, they were pretty good not overly heavy on the juice side. Next up with got the smoked fries AND the goat chili fries for the table. Both fries were good, but the goat chili were a standout! The flavor was delicious, the goat was cooked well and it didn't taste too goaty if that makes sense. For an entree, I got the parathas burrito. Now, being Indian and eating parathas my entire life I do have high expectations for a paratha. This one unfortunately disappointed. It wasn't as butter as what I'm used to, and the flavor of the overall fish was lacking. It needed a spice element, possibly roasted spiced potatoes? That would make it close to an aloo paratha and would probably be great with the avocado and the egg. The ""this little piggy went to China"" was really good. Flavorful, and the biscuit was soft and perfect with the sausage and egg. The Okonomiyaki was also very flavorful and a good choice. The fish tostadas were a surprise find; crispy tostada combined with crispy slaw and tender fish was a good bite. My friends also enjoyed the goat burger, but I was not a fan. "
,,,,,"Overall, the food was decent but just not what I was expecting after eating at Girl and the Goat. The goat chili fries were my favorite item we tried and I would come back to order just a plate of those."

,,,,,"Ok the prime reason for this review is only because of  overly grotesquely sweet PB&J sundae. I mean I'm shocked and awed this had stayed on the menu to be frank. With all the high marks no one must have tried this little diddy. I mean I'm like a PB superfan but this was overkill in the face to PB&J fans. I think I had a sweet diabetic, heart attack it was an odd out of body experience in all the wrong ways. Like Why? And how and why? Like I thought was definitely gonna do a psychedelic sugar coma. It wasn't even a tasty sugar coma. Just no. Please don't do this to PB&J again. Put a disclaimer. It was too much and waaay too sweet. It was a nice try but no. Oh and I had the bulls eye french toast."
,,,,,I finally got to try Stephanie Izard's restaurant! After I got off the plane at 8:45am and I was able to make a reservation for 9:45am. 
,,,,,"I was definitely attracted by the cute name ""little piggy went to China"". The sausage platter definitely tastes a lot like traditional Szechuan sausage, in a different form. Such a smart fusion idea! "
,,,,,"Smashed pork belly potato was amazingly good! Outside is crispy. The potato has a bit vinegar flavor, with mayonnaise sauce, I couldn't stop eating. "
,,,,,The fried spicy chicken sandwich was nothing to note. 
,,,,,Get the little goat latte. It's made of goat milk!
,,,,,It. Was. Amazing.
,,,,,"The food was delicious, unique combinations that just worked very well together...even after we were full, we kept on eating!!"
,,,,,Went with girlfriends and we had...
,,,,,1. Little Piggy from China (or something like that)
,,,,,2. Tonkatsu Sandwich 
,,,,,3. Chocolate Chip Pancakes - whipped chocolate butter!
,,,,,4. Okonomiyaki
,,,,,"5. S'mores Sundae (cause as our amazing server George said, ""Ice cream just fills in the cracks!"""
,,,,,"Service from George was top notch! He had us cracking up each time he came by - which was a lot! He also gave us really good recommendations (on food, and touristy things to do in Chicago!)"
,,,,,Looking forward to my next trip out - so many other things I want to try on their menu!
,,,,,"I was not sure about this place. The brunch menu had a few infusion meals I was not sure about, plus there was an hour wait."
,,,,,But the hour wait was well worth it! The food was amazing! We each order and meal and then shared it family style so we could have a little of everything!
,,,,,I just moved to Chicago and this was the first place I went to eat! Great first impression! Loved the decor -- it's super hip. Also the staff is very friendly and accommodating of allergies. I ordered the braised beef sandwich. Very flavorful and tender meat! Also loved that it came with avocado and almost like a Cole slaw. The only critique i have is that the sandwich was so loaded the bread became a little soggy. We also shared the smoked fries as a side and I loved the smoky flavor! So unique! I definitely want to come back to try their breakfast dishes! 
,,,,,"Update: I did go back to try a breakfast dish! I ordered the bull's eye French toast which was delicious. And so hearty that I couldn't finish it all. I enjoyed it because it had a little bit of everything and lots of delicious flavors. The toast was a sweet onion brioche (loved the brioche texture, not super onion-y) that had just the right amount of syrup so that it wasn't too sweet or soggy. I loved the over-hard egg baked in the middle (usually it's served over-easy). On top were sliced strawberries and cut pieces of fried chicken. I loved that the chicken was sliced and wasn't presented as one huge wedge. Plus, it was perfectly crisped and tasty too! Very filling dish, but delicious."

,,,,,"One of the frequent spots for brunch in the West Loop area, the Little Goat Diner can be found jam packed with people on the weekends. Even with a reservation, it still took around an additional 5-10 mins to get seated."
,,,,,"Goat Chili Fries - One of the more famous dishes that oddly is no longer on the menu, but can still be ordered. The gravy is not too rich and carries the slight hint of goat flavor. Sadly not much minced lamb meat is available though the chives brought a good balance to the dish. Score of 4/5"
,,,,,Okonomiyaki - A Japanese inspired dish that tastes much lighter than the ones I had in Japan. This is actually a good thing as I usually find the authentic Okonomiyaki to be pretty overpowering with their sauce. It's basically a Japanese style pancake though I couldn't really taste the protein in it. Score of 3.5/5
,,,,,"Bulls Eye French Toast - Fried chicken, strawberries sitting on a bed of crunchy French toast with an egg hiding in the folds of the toast. Plus points for the gooey egg with the toast, though the fried chicken didn't really stand out much in the dish. Score of 3.5/5"
,,,,,Overall I would rate the food at a score of 4/5 but docking one star off given there were a ton of house flies buzzing around which was an unpleasant experience.
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner is the first spot that I hit up when I landed in Chicago. Their place is so decent, well-decorated, and they have so great atmosphere. I remember the food I ordered, I tried their French toast and their barbeque, and that was so amazing! That food I ordered is so flavorful, tender, juicy, and their creative twists to food is well done. Little Goat Diner will never disappoint you, they will guarantee the sensational food, cozy vibe, and wonderful service. I really love this place, never had a bad meal here, and their coffee and other drinks are so fantastic. They also got the great location, so near, can find so easily, and their place is so big and comfortable. I really want to try and explore everything on their menu, I will definitely go back here again, and probably I am with my special someone like friends or family. This place is one of Chicago's best restaurant. Thank you Little Goat Diner! Great food! Great atmosphere! Awesome staff! You did a great job! Keep it up! Thank you!"
,,,,,"Gabriel, it's great to hear that we could feed you upon your arrival to Chicago. Thanks for the kind words about the atmosphere here, and we're even more pleased that you loved the dishes you tried. We look forward to your next visit so that we can introduce you to even more meals on our menu. We really appreciate your business and kind words about us! See you next time."
,,,,,"Happy to have finally made it to Little Goat for brunch today after many, many people recommended it. The food definitely lived up to the hype. Had the mimosa, bullseye french toast & cinnabun and both were fantastic, though too much to finish in one sitting."
,,,,,"I was also able to try the okonomiyaki, which was a unique, flavorful dish as well. I'd say it was comparable in deliciousness to the french toast, though totally different."
,,,,,Definitely come here with a group and order different dishes so you can try a variety of items on the menu!
,,,,,"Before you ask -- Yes, the wait is absolutely worth it. Little Goat Diner is essentially the totally casual, American diner version of Girl and the Goat. The menu items are incredibly unique and incredibly delicious."
,,,,,"I've been here a few times and each time, the waiters were extraordinarily helpful and polite. No matter how busy the place is, the food always seems to come out very quickly. "
,,,,,Here's how I'd rank the dishes I've tried:
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went to China (4/5) - This is the most interesting dish I tried here. It's mostly savory (aside from some berries) and has a good mix of textures going on.
,,,,,"Okonomiyaki (5/5) - Hard to describe beyond savory pancake, but incredibly delicious and I recommend it very highly"
,,,,,"Los Drowned (4.5/5) - Juicy, flavorful, unique, yum. "
,,,,,"Paratha Burrito (4.5/5) - I'd describe this is a sort of contemporary American-Indian fusion. Not a burrito you'd eat with your hands, but just as tasty as an other burrito."
,,,,,I'd suggest making a reservation or coming in between lunch-dinner to cut the wait short.
,,,,,Definitely stop by if you're hungry and in West Loop!
,,,,,"Love this place- child friendly, wide variety on the menu, large portions and good service. There is usually a wait, so I would plan ahead for that, but there's lots to do in the neighborhood while waiting for a table."
,,,,,"I love how the restaurant mixes Asian and American flavors and serve it up in a casual ""diner"" experience. I definitely recommend"

,,,,,"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on Sunday late morning around 11am. It was at least a 30 minutes wait for us. We were seated at the bar and once we put in our orders, the food came pretty quick. "
,,,,,"I ordered This Little Piggy Went To China, the sunny side eggs were good but the pork sausage was a little on the salty side. I recommend adding hot sauce to dampen the saltiness. My boyfriend had Okonomiyaki, he said it was really good! I tried it and I agree, it was good! I would recommend that dish. Both of our food portions were good, it wasn't too big and it was just nice for us. "
,,,,,We saw that many people ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast. I believe it has crispy chicken and strawberries on French Toast. That must be a good dish. I would want to come back to try the other dishes on their menu!
,,,,,Had an amazing experience at Little Goat! 
,,,,,I'm so happy that we came here last minute! (Our last dining place in Chicago before we left for the airport) All of their food items were excellent! 
,,,,,We ordered a short rib tostada that came with a Yuzu harissa and kumquat pick de Gallo. This was the star! The meat was super tender and basically melted in your mouth. I loved the flavor combination of everything on my one tostada (has to share... grr!). 
,,,,,"We also ordered the goat chili cheese fries, bulls eye French toast, and got some fish tostadas on the house (per runner error, but we gladly accepted with approval). Everything had it's unique flavors and we will definitely be back! "
,,,,,"Thankfully, no wait either :) "
,,,,,"We came in on a Monday morning, 11:30am."
,,,,,"We stopped in here after not being able to get into another restaurant and I can't wait to go back!! We had to sit at the counter, which was fine. The waiter we had was great and very attentive with food allergies. The patty melt was one of the best we've had. We also had the Korean chicken tacos which were good, but I would get something different next time. And the fries were cooke perfectly! Can't wait to go back and try some other items!"
,,,,,"We know we succeeded when you say you can't wait to come back to Little Goat! We're so happy that your search for an excellent meal led you to us and that we were able to accommodate you. It's outstanding to hear that your service was up to par and that we took care to cater to your food allergies. We're glad that each item you ordered improved your meal overall and hope you'll return to enjoy more perfectly cooked fries in the near future, Alex!"
,,,,,"The Little Goat Diner did not disappoint! I was in Chicago for a few days for a conference, and knew I had to try something in the Stephanie Izard empire. I had a long break Sunday morning, so I opted for a 10:00 reservation for one at the counter."
,,,,,"Id highly recommend making a reservation, because even the counter space filled up quickly. I couldn't decide what to order (shocking), so I went with the special. I can't remember what it was called, but it was essentially a Cobb salad on top of two pieces of avocado toast with fried egg and fried chicken. I also had coffee and a mimosa."
,,,,,"Sitting at the counter, I had the pleasure (or agony) of seeing almost all the orders ready at the window. EVERYTHING looked and smelled devine. I saw lots and lots of waffles with fresh strawberries and fried chicken."
,,,,,"My meal was fresh and filling. My favorite part of the whole dish was the friend chicken! Service was pretty good, given how busy they were, and atmosphere was lively and fun."
,,,,,"Highly recommend this place for first timers in Chicago! My cousin took me here and according to her we took dark chocolate chip pancakes, loved them so much the crunch and the perfect softness and lightness of the pancakes. So good  Other than the pancakes we also tried out the what about kebab, so we had a savoury dish with out pancakes. Also amazing the pita bread so soft, the tahini for dipping the kebabs was a great amount and the quinoa salad with it was so delicious. The dish came together as so lovely, recommend both dishes and for drinks we had hot chocolate and green tea! Love this dinner, will come back in the future !"
,,,,,"What a fabulous brunch! Outdoor seating was a bit brisk, but nice. Wait staff was friendly and gave great recommendations."
,,,,,"The Little Goat Diner is a cute restaurant that plays on the nostalgia of eating in a quaint corner diner. The space is large is it is great for groups (or any other occasion, such as a date)."
,,,,,The fusion of Asian and American foods is done very well. The dishes are delicious. The pork scallion pancake was large. The pancake was crispy and reminded me of the classic Chinese scallion pancakes while the pork belly was rich and savoury. The slaw on top added some acidity and freshness to the dish.
,,,,,I really enjoyed Little Goat Diner and cannot wait to return.
,,,,,I am a bit disappointed! This place is just average. We drove in from O'Hare fighting moderate but aggressive traffic and paid $16 for valet parking in order to eat at that this awesome sounding place with 3900 reviews yielding a four star average. 
,,,,,"To get a table at lunch time was a 1 hour wait. They have an espresso bar and outdoor seating so we enjoyed espresso drinks and cookies outside while we waited. I got an americano (surprise, I know) but the others got lattes and macchiatos with goat milk - except wait they were out of goat milk. All good nonetheless. "
,,,,,"Once seated, in a booth with torn upholstery and very worn out springs, I ordered a burger with goat meat and cheddar instead of American cheese, and the corn elotes as a $7 side. The bun was brioche and well on the way to being burnt. Burnt was the overwhelming flavor of this burger. The cheese was American, not cheddar. Other than the meat, it was a mushy mess. The goat meat itself was fine.  The corn elotes were good but would have been happier with half the portion. "
,,,,,"So we had fun seeking this place out and eating at such a hipster place, but I can really only recommend the espressos."
,,,,,The location is very close to many attractions and great spots. Seeing such a vibrant area and great menu section allows one to expand there taste buds. I ordered the shrimp and grits and was not expecting the taste to be more similar to a soup versus the southern style typical dish. I was not impressed with the service or the wait staff and the demeanor of the place very short and not polite. I would say the pancakes were fantastic and I would order those again but that's about it for the place. I'm sure other items are good on the menu however the shrimp and grits are not your traditional taste on the delicious southern dish.
,,,,,We went to Little Goat Diner around 8:30AM on a Sunday and got right in without a reservation. The food and service were excellent.
,,,,,"Little Goat Latte - Latte made with goat's milk - this was good. It is a different flavor than I'm used to in my lattes, but I would get it again."
,,,,,"This Little Piggy Went to China - SO GOOD. This was the best thing we ordered and all items were delicious. The waiter said that it would have a kick, but I did not find it to be that spicy."
,,,,,Pork Belly Home Fries - these were good. It is fried potatoes with huge chunks of pork belly. We ended up taking them home and reheating in the oven and they were equally good a second time.
,,,,,"Bull's Eye French Toast - I would say this was the weakest item that we ordered. It was French toast with an egg in the middle of each piece of bread, topped with fried chicken and BBQ syrup. If you're into this sort of thing you may love it, but I found it to be bland compared to the other dishes we ordered."
,,,,,Hope to come back for lunch next time!
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"I don't think I've ever encountered a diner that serves Asian fusion cuisine! I was really surprised to see asian dishes such as ""Bi Bim Bop"" next to Southern Comfort dishes such as ""Shrimp and Cheesy Grits"". I was even further surprised to see that multiple East Asian countries are represented on the menu (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, etc...) because restaurants that cook fusion usually just choose two countries in order to create a more cohesive menu. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and one of the cocktails which had vodka and watermelon in it. The ""pancake"" in the dish is actually a savory Chinese crepe with scallions. I thought the crepe paired well with the huge chunk of pork belly on top, and the Bok Choy slaw-like salad on top worked well to cut through the heaviness of this dish. However, the pork belly was REALLY FATTY (but good) and the House Hoisin was a bit too salty. I also thought the cocktail had a really minimal amount of alcohol in it, I also tried a few of the drinks my friends ordered and could not tell if there was alcohol in them at all. This doesn't seem like a great place to order drinks, or maybe we should have ordered non-cocktails. "
,,,,,"Nitpicking aside, I did think that our overall meal was delicious. The portion sizes were slightly small and it was a bit pricey, but I thought the flavors were pretty good. The concept of elevated Asian fusion diner food can be difficult to execute but Little Goat is able to produce dishes that would make customers come back to try more."
,,,,,Slightly obsessed with Stephanie Izard = going to two of her restaurants in a 3 day weekend trip.  
,,,,,"Reservations were made, thankfully, because the wait here can be insane.  Despite the word ""Diner"" in the name, I didn't quite realize just how diner-themed this place would be.  That's not a bad thing, it goes perfectly with her comfort food themed menu, and got me even more excited about the dishes."
,,,,,"Ok, so ""comfort food"" doesn't quite cover the menu here.  True there are comfort food staples, but then you're also hit with some twists on traditional Asian dishes, which makes me even happier.  "
,,,,,"Dishes are quite big here, so don't do like we did and order 3 things to share, it's just way way too much.  My hubby loved his Goat Melt, and I loved my Korean Bi Bim Bop on cauliflower rice, and washed it down with a Bloody Mary.  I think we both ate half our dishes and were stuffed, but yet our 3rd item came out lol.  Jessica G. insisted I order the crumpets, but luckily I had forgotten, no way we would have had room!"
,,,,,The service was quick and friendly and made me want to stay longer and order even more!
,,,,,Made a reservation for my husband's birthday dinner. Confirmed outside seating as one child is unvaccinated. Rain predicted so I called pre-dinner to confirm seating. Was told it would not be an issue because outside area is covered. Arrived only to be told outside seating was closed due to (light) rain and that person on phone has misinformed me. Robotic and unsympathetic manager delivered the news. Really disappointing. Thanks for ruining my husband's birthday dinner. We would not have come if we knew the outside area would be closed. So much for phoning first.
,,,,,This summer I took 3 mentees for dinner at the outdoor dinning. The woman who took our order was super kind as we debated what to get. The food wasn't quite as good as I expected (thus 4 stars) but I loved the outdoor dining they had set up for Covid.
,,,,,"I'm not sure who copied who, but this place is VERY similar to Spenard Roadhouse in Anchorage:"
,,,,,hip-casual ambiance
,,,,,comfort food with a twist
,,,,,great service
,,,,,always crowded
,,,,,rotating menu
,,,,,has other restaurants in different styles around town under same ownership
,,,,,"That is, to say, it's excellent."
,,,,,"This is kind of a local, farm-to-table-ish take on diner food.  We got sides and shareables and sampled each others food.  (something I also do at Spenard Roadhouse)  Everything was excellent, it made me wish I had a larger stomach."
,,,,,"I love the bar that doubles as a waiting area, it doesn't at all feel like an afterthought, it has its own little vibe going on."
,,,,,"Do not. I repeat, do not miss the chance to have breakfast at Little Goat (or lunch or dinner). Look up the story of Stephanie Izard from Top Chef. I'm inspired by her restaurants,  atmosphere and unique flavor creations (and I usually am not into unique flavor creations). But, this was an all-time top breakfast spot. "
,,,,,"We had ""This Little Piggy Goes to China"" a Chinese-inspired sausage and egg sandwich on a homemade biscuit. And, ""Everything is Everything Crumpets"" - crumpets were the best pastry/bread item I've EVER had. Amazing!!! Tzaziki cream cheese and fried egg salad. Wow!!"
,,,,,"Loved the vibe here. We did not have a lunch time reservation but the wait was only about 20 minutes on a Saturday. I got the reuben (who knew kimchi could make a sandwich so complete?!?) and my husband got the bull's eye french toast. My reuben was very hearty, I only ate half of it and brought the rest home. The french toast dish was good but a little too sweet for my husband's taste. If we are ever back in Chicago we will give it a shot. Portions were extraordinary! So big!"
,,,,,"Wow wow wow. Excellent brunch. The pancakes are delicious. It's definitely not a ""traditional"" brunch, but soooo delicious. Flavors remind of Asian cuisine. We ordered the ""little pig went to China"", ""okonomiyaki"", and the veggie omelette for savory. And then we complemented with he blueberry and chocolate pancakes. My favorite was the okonomiyaki and the blueberry pancakes but everything was delicious."
,,,,,"I had the okonomiyaki because that it what is suggested. I would not have this again mainly because of the smell of fish. I am not much a fish person at all and the ingredient on top, bonito, flakes I believe were the cause of the smell. With that being said, I wasn't really able to enjoy this item. "
,,,,,"As far as the home fries and pork belly, they were out of this world. My only negative to this would be the saltiness. "
,,,,,I would definitely come back and try something other than the okonomiyaki. 
,,,,,The atmosphere was a cool and modern hip vibe. 
,,,,,The service was fine.
,,,,,"Came here for my first time from out of state, and had an interesting take on breakfast food. I got the Little Piggy went to China, Okonomiyaki, and the Bull's Eye French Toast. The Little Piggy visually looked good and the taste was just like the way it looked. Okonomiyaki was an asian inspired dish with flavors that complimented my early slightly savory dish. Then I ended it with the Bull's Eye French Toast...though I was thinking the I would taste the savory chicken, it was slightly overpowered bu the french toast, but still good. All in all, staff during covid was good."

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,**Vegetarian/Vegan Friendly**
,,,,,"Oh man, this place was FANTASTIC. The regular menu is very robust, and they have a vegan menu!"
,,,,,"I had the Avocado Crumpets and Bunless Veggie Burger from the Vegan Menu. Both were excellent! I ordered the Crispy Cauliflower Manchurian from the Regular Menu. The regular menu dish comes with a base of cheesy grits, which pulls all the flavors together. I've had Manchurian in a few places, but this place had a very deep flavor that you taste even after you swallowed the bite. "
,,,,,"I couldn't leave without dessert! We had the Puddin' on the Ritz...enter food coma! If you're a fan of butterscotch, this is very much your dessert! They make their own ritz crackers in-house, which just made the crust out of this world. My friend's words on the crust was ""I want to bathe in this crust."" "
,,,,,"I would absolutely be back, and recommend it to a friend. "
,,,,,PS: Make a reservation ~2 weeks in advance.
,,,,,OKONOMIYAKI-- was amazing!! Pork belly with Unagi sauce is genius! It's like a giant scallion pancake. It is a must order. 
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went To China-- kind of felt like this little piggy and biscuit were drowned in Italian dressing. That's probably just my tastebuds though. The veggies on the side were delicious but the sauce was not for me. 
,,,,,Ooey Gooey Cinnabon- this was a decent cinnamon bun.
,,,,,"Menu items have significantly been reduced during pandemic, less gluten friendly options. "
,,,,," We made reservations were seated in a timely manner. The server was friendly and nice. My biggest complaint besides the limited gluten free options is that we were asked to leave after 90 mins of dining. I had out of town guests with me and although everyone's meal average $25 or more for my party and we left a generous tip, we were asked to leave due to another reservation.  If there is a time limit on dining in it should be posted. Extremely disappointed with the restaurant establishment."
,,,,,"Cute little diner my friend and I went to for dessert after dinner at The Girl and the Goat. It had an old-fashioned feel to it. I ordered a milkshake and a glass of champagne, just to be fancy, and the champagne came in a plastic glass. Not so fancy....ha!"
,,,,,"My friend and I made a reservation at Little Goat for breakfast this morning and were so impressed, both by the service and the quality of food. The waitstaff was super friendly and several precautions were taken (masks, temperatures taken at door, sanitizer) to make the dining experience safe and comfortable. I greatly enjoyed my meal and the dollop of goat milk honey yogurt on top upgraded a would-be basic dish."
,,,,,I had been to The Girl & The Goat so I was expecting big things from Little Goat Diner. I went in on a Monday at 4 and I was one of the only tables. The atmosphere is very light and energetic!
,,,,,"What I ordered: I started off with a cappuccino-- amazing. Def one of the best I've had in the city. It was perfectly frothy with no bitter, sour taste. For an appetizer I tried the tempura potatoes. They were good. There was a lot of Asian flavor. For my main I got the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl. It sounded good, but there was something off to me. Idk if the pickled veggies didn't sit right in my stomach or the sauce was spoiled sour-tasting. I truthfully am already having stomach problems after eating here. "
,,,,,"Overall I think their food is of good quality, I just couldn't help but think: I could be at au cheval right now:/ "
,,,,,"(Unrelated, but this restaurant has one of the most well done websites I have ever seen.)"
,,,,,Personally I do not believe the hype with this place.
,,,,,Every dish I've ever had here has been delicious! I think their shrimp and grits are sublime.
,,,,,I absolutely love LGD!! Stephanie Izard has cultivated such a fantastic group of restaurants. The Diner is the perfect spot for lunch. Make sure you come hungry! The portions are large and PACKED with flavor!
,,,,,Thank you Elise for your wonderful review of Little Goat! Your kind words will certainly be shared with Stephanie and she will be over the moon to hear that you enjoy so much of the menu. We hope to see you again soon for another great meal!
,,,,,"The ""ooygooy"" cinnamon role is a dry piece of bread. The ""loaded hash browns"" seem like something out of a mediocre food truck. And to top it all off, the coffee is bitter. Also--they raised their prices."
,,,,,"Overall, my entire group was really disappointed in our experience.  With so many awesome restaurants in the areas, I strongly recommend skipping this spot...at least during this covid pandemic!"
,,,,,"The little goat diner is definitely a nice spot for Sunday brunch, great for family and friends gathering!"
,,,,,Food is delicious and coffee is great
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Great place to stop by for brunch! Their menu has a wide variety of options and is heavily asian-influenced. I've never been to an asian/brunch fusion type place before so trying the food here was a unique experience.
,,,,,"This Little Piggy Went to China (4/5): I ordered this since it seemed to be one of the most popular items based on yelp reviews, and it did not disappoint! If you can't handle spice at all then I probably wouldn't get it as it has a slight ""ma la"" (numbing spice) flavor. Definitely a unique taste as I've never experienced that flavor with brunch items before."
,,,,,"Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl (3/5): An interesting twist on typical bibimbap bowls. There is no meat, and the rice is replaced with cauliflower rice (great option if you're cutting down on carbs!). Personally I found it a little bland and I felt the cauliflower rice didn't help much as it had a lot of moisture in it. I think if the cauliflower rice was stir fried to remove the moisture and add some texture, it would pair better with the rest of the dish."
,,,,,"Based on what I heard, this place can get super crowded so reservations are usually recommended. We came on a Tuesday at 10:30am with a reservation, and the restaurant was pretty empty. It started to fill up a bit more as lunchtime approached but was never super crowded. If you decide to come here on a weekday during the daytime but don't have a reservation, you'll probably still be fine. I can see it being super busy on weekend mornings though so definitely make a reservation if you're planning to come during that time."
,,,,,We came here late afternoon on Valentine's Day with my girlfriend; I made reservations online which was super simple and easy to do. 
,,,,,Finding free parking in the area can be tough but there are plenty of street parking ($4.50 an hour). Valet parking is offered!
,,,,,The entire restaurant is a diner vibe with a twist on breakfast and lunch favorites. I love the fact you can order breakfast items for dinner as an option - sometimes you just want a stack of pancakes at 6pm. 
,,,,,"I ordered the 1/2lb beef All-American burger, girlfriend got the pork belly scallion pancake and chai tea with almond milk, and we shared the order of messy fun fries and little piggy went to China. Everything was delicious! She especially enjoyed the banana peppers and brined/pickled onions with the fries. They're all on the pricier side of diner food but worth the experience for a slight twist on some classics. Needless to say, we were stuffed by the end."
,,,,,Want to go back next time and try the other breakfast food options. Regretted not trying their All-Star weekends specials but we had our bellies set on the other fixin's 
,,,,,"Forgot to mention, service is great! I forgot our waiter's name but he was attentive and super friendly."
,,,,,"I was excited to try Little Goat Diner as it is my best friend's favorite brunch place. So, to be fair, I had high expectations. "
,,,,,"The atmosphere is very cute, with minimal decor but very open and not too noisy. However, it took us awhile to be seated (30 mins or so) despite several open spots at communal tables that never seemed to fill up while we were eating, even. "
,,,,,"There were several things on the menu that looked tasty but I saw lots of Yelp reviews that recommended This Little Piggy Went to China, so I decided on that. To be honest, I was disappointed. The dish had a very strong, distinct flavor that wasn't my favorite. The pork patty was very large (too thick for my liking but I assume that could be a plus for some people) and the gooseberries were a strange addition, in my opinion. "
,,,,,"I recognize that this was only one dish, and I would be open to going back to try other things on the menu, but I wanted to give an honest review of this dish as I saw pretty much only positive reviews before."
,,,,,TL;DR Great atmosphere but food might be trying too hard.
,,,,,$17 diner burger that doesn't come with fries. For that reason I'm out. Food was fine but it just seems like diner food with hipster prices.
,,,,,I have been here a few times in the past few years but our visit over the weekend was a little disappointing. 
,,,,,"We went at 8:30am and my friend visiting from out of town asked to be seated prior to our arrival, she was told very bluntly (my friend said rudely) that was not possible which started our meal on a sour note. I get that it is their rule, but there is a nice way to say it. "
,,,,,"Once we arrived, we waited for our table to be set up for a few minutes and then were seated. It was the longest we've ever had to wait for an early reservation.Once we ordered, service was fast. It did take a while to get our order in. "
,,,,,"We ordered the Fat Club (a fav of mine that literally always yields leftovers), the Waffle, and the oatmeal. The oatmeal was shockingly bad inedible. It had a very sour aftertaste. We took leftovers home in hopes it would taste better at home but ultimately ended up tossing it."
,,,,,For the kiddo we ordered the pancakes with a side of soft scrambled eggs which was a big hit.
,,,,,"The food was spectacular!  My bride got the Veggie Burger Bahn Mi style, and the texture of the burger was just right, then with the spicy/sweet/sour Bahn Mi mix on it, plus a great soft bun, this was a huge hit.  We shared an order of fries between the four of us and it was an excellent extra side dish that everyone loved.  Keep in mind these are no ordinary fries, they are duck fat fried with a hint of savory spices that make them irresistible.  My daughter had a bowl of the coconut curry veggie soup which is even better than it sounds, so my wife and I split a cup also, as a side.  Our grandson had the best Mac & Cheese I have ever tasted.  While I had the Parathas Burrito, which uses and Indian flatbread, chili pepper sauce, avocado, bean salad, mont-amore cheese and sunny side up eggs with greens on top.  Yeah, it was awesome.  "
,,,,,We also had the Turmeric Tea to help boost our immune system on a cold and blustery winter day.  Every time we go here it is a food-orgasm. Love this place.  
,,,,,"The service was good, but not nearly as good as the food."
,,,,,Was visiting Chicago for the first time and wanted to try this place out after watching her on Top Chef! 
,,,,,The food: 
,,,,,Nachos-very Good and highly recommend! The chips are a little thicker which is great for all the toppings. The chili has a bit of cinnamon taste which gives it good flavor. 
,,,,,"Creole chicken sandwich- yes you can get a chicken sandwich about anywhere but the sauce, good fried chicken and bun made this one delicious sandwich and one of the best I have had in a longtime! "
,,,,,Smoked fries-so good and tasty! You can taste the smoked flavor but it is not overwhelming and they are nice and crisp! 
,,,,,We came at 7:45 on a Wednesday night and it was busy! Glad we had made a reservation. We're quickly seated and had good service.
,,,,,It's a diner that serves breakfast all day and some Asian inspired twists on dishes. The atmosphere is alive with the clatter of plates and buzz of diners. Seems to be in the throes of perpetual breakfast rush. 
,,,,,"Their chili was tasty yet different. More soupy than thick, but incredibly flavorful. Ground beef is the main ingredient and there's some kidney beans, but also chickpeas and jalapeño. I'd guess there's some fish sauce to up the umami quality. A Tried and true Texan might be appalled but it all works. "
,,,,,"Pork Belly home fries are really well seasoned smashed potatoes with generous chunks of pork belly.  There's a little thinly sliced jalapeño in there to spice things up and topped with a drizzle of mayo to cool it down. It's listed as a side but makes a hearty meal on its own, especially if one were to top it with a fried egg. "
,,,,,It's a popular place with a good reputation and worth a try.
,,,,,"WOW. Ok, I don't know why I don't have photos of them  but the PORK BELLY HOME FRIES. SO. GOOD. I'm salivating right now just thinking about them.  There are so many choices at Little Goat, I'm always struggling to decide if I want to get the same thing I ordered last time (because I came here craving it) or if I should order something else that sounds equally amazing. Also not pictured, but I'm always coming back craving the Bull's Eye French Toast as well."
,,,,,"Awesome brunch. Perfect spot if your looking for a brunch experience more focused on great food and less on a ""boozy Sunday"". Had blueberry pancakes, little piggy and corn beef hash and eggs. Everything was perfect. Kid friendly too."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,You wanna load up on some edible crack? Get some of this stuff right now. Tastes damn amazing. 10/10 f*ckin delicious
,,,,,Went here for dinner and the food was amazing! Definitely wanna come back again for breakfast/brunch
,,,,,It's great to hear that you loved your experience at Little Goat! We're here for your next brunch out! Thanks for eating with us.
,,,,,"This place is amazing! My friend and I came on a Sunday evening with 7:15pm reservations. I had the fried chicken sandwich and my friend opted for the patty melt with the veggie burger. The sandwich was one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had! It came with a spicy mayo and their housemade hot sauce, both of which I requested on the side. The spicy mayo was delicious. The hot sauce was very good as well, although I only used a little bit since I'm not a huge fan of hot sauces in general. My friend said the veggie burger patty melt was very good. It wasn't your traditional veggie burger (more of an ""elevated"" veggie burger) and very flavorful. We also got sides of smoked fries and Mac and cheese to share. The side of fries was delicious and huge, definitely enough for 2 to share (which is nice considering the $7 price tag) and the Mac and cheese was pretty large and tasty as well. We opted to take our desserts to go since we were so full from the awesome meal. They have a bakery right next door (Sugargoat) which is a MUST TRY. We got the citrus vanilla cupcake, the brown butter blueberry cupcake, and the cinnamon roll cookies. The citrus vanilla cupcake was amazing. I usually don't care for buttercream frosting - too sweet for me - but this was more of a whipped frosting (YUM), and the cupcake was light and flavorful. The cinnamon roll cookies were SO GOOD, soft and delicious. The service was great as well; our server was super fast and friendly and helped with menu questions and recommendations. Try the Little Goat, you won't regret it!"
,,,,,"Little Goat did not disappoint. Absolutely adorable interior, plenty of seating options whether you prefer indoor, outdoor, counter style, etc."
,,,,,We made an eaaaaarly breakfast res. (7:30!) wanting to get the day going and jam pack as much Chicago into our Saturday as possible. We were running a little late...7:30 on a Saturday might've been a little ambitious...and the host was super friendly both over the phone and once we arrived. Our server was also great.
,,,,,"There was a little confusion re: drinks--I ordered the bloody mary, BF ordered a mimosa, we both received bloody marys, and then when we pointed out the miscommunication, it took like 15 minutes for his mimosa to arrive (much to our server's confusion as well). That little blip in service aside, the bloody mary was PHENOMENAL. The kimchi really adds an interesting and unique flavor and I was loving every sip. The coffee was also great."
,,,,,We started with a cinnamon roll. Apparently they are a super hot commodity that sells out so we took advantage of our early arrival time and enjoyed one. Well worth the indulgent calories.
,,,,,"I felt like I could've thrown a dart at the menu and loved anything I ordered. However, I chose the Little Piggy Went to China based on Yelp reviews. I was not let down. This dish is jam.packed. with flavor. The biscuit was incredible, and I couldn't stop sopping up the sauce on this dish. My boyfriend had the french toast with chicken and as he was commenting that the dish would be great with a fried egg, he cuts into a piece of the french toast and lo and behold there's an egg baked into it. Amazing. "
,,,,,I have two regrets: (1) we didn't try the goat chili cheese fries. I will be back; and (2) we had leftovers but had such a busy day ahead we couldn't eat them.
,,,,,"This is a fantastic restaurant. It's super busy yet very efficient. I had ""This little Piggy went to China"" which was amazing with the flavors; gooseberries such a great addition. My waiter Jonny made me feel like I was a regular in a small neighborhood diner instead of a large city with his attentive service. Will be back!"
,,,,,"We're smiling hearing that Jonny made you feel like a regular in a small neighborhood diner! He'll be delighted to hear that feedback, and we're very pleased that you thoroughly enjoyed This Little Piggy Went To China. The Little Goat team is always happy to serve someone who has an appreciation for big flavors, and we hope to see you again soon for brunch, Barbara!"
,,,,,"Sweets look good, but I have no idea because the lady ""working"" the counter seems to have no clue how to help customers. She was busy trying to figure out how to work their POS and couldn't be bothered to acknowledge anyone else. When someone is standing in your store for several minutes, a simple ""hi, be right with you"" can actually keep a customer. Not lose one like you just did."
,,,,,"Ah, yes, girl and the goat's cheaper/more casual cousin. The chef is the same but the food is fancy diner-y. Usually fairly easy to get a reservation (except I don't think they take reservations for brunch?)"
,,,,,"Drinks are good, coffee drinks are good (Goat milk latte = yum), milkshakes are good"
,,,,,"Not everything on the menu is great, but the bullseye french toast is definitely amazing"
,,,,,I really enjoyed the retro-modern feel of the place. I had the corned beef hash and it was ok. I was disappointed in the hash because it was simply hash browns topped with corned beef. I enjoy hash when it's all cooked together and there's a nice crust on it. Maybe even some onions and peppers in it.
,,,,,My wife had the cinnabon and it was very good. Service was good but not great. The menu has some really neat sounding dishes that I'd like to return and try!
,,,,,"a little disappointed, but that's alright. "
,,,,,atmosphere.
,,,,,"we were seated outside, which was not preferable but it ended up being really nice people watching. many cool dogs. our waitperson was very kind and helpful, they were one of the best parts of the experience."
,,,,,food.
,,,,,"ordered the biscuit and gravy, chicken sammie, and a crab dip. "
,,,,,"the biscuit and gravy was pretty good - the gravy was flavorful and the biscuit was good. the portion was rather small for the cost, and this is a reoccurring theme with this restaurant. "
,,,,,"my partner got a fried chicken sammie, which he describes as ""good""."
,,,,,"the crab dip was very good, but we only got 8 crackers which only really got us through half of the (small) container of dip. "
,,,,,"the drink selections were unique, with some good non alcoholic beverages. "
,,,,,"all in all, the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about. but the service was nice and that contributed to most of the stars."
,,,,,"I love coming here for brunch.  I had the Bi Bim Bop Breakfast Bowl.  The crunch factor is a 10/10 and even though I was full half way through, I finished it anyway (I had a full glass of plain grapefruit juice before this).  I also got the grapefruit mimosa which was hard to not get a refill on.  "
,,,,,"The restaurant is always crowded when I go so I make sure to get a reservation. If it's just 2 people, sitting at the bar is a good idea. I always see solo people getting breakfast at the bar. "
,,,,,A little bit pricey considering the portions. The restaurant feels like you woke up and just opened the curtains to a super bright and happy day.
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Love this place. Set up like an upscale diner. Food is delicious. There are some more out-there menu items for adventurous eaters and some more standard diner fare for picky eaters. Someone can always find something to eat here. I hear the roof is amazing but I have never been on it.
,,,,,"Brian, we love hearing that our menu has something for everyone! We aim to have a diverse menu that will delight all of our diners, and it's wonderful to hear we're succeeding. Thank you for leaving Little Goat a supportive review, and we hope we'll have the opportunity to serve you again soon!"
,,,,,Been here a few times with friends and keep coming back for the hearty food. Breakfast all day is a huge plus!  The menu takes traditional items and puts a spin on them. Really enjoy the little piggy and Parantha burrito for those who prefer savory and blueberry pancakes for my sweet tooths out there. The Korean tacos are just okay - too much cole slaw and not enough meat. Overall an elevated diner experience with quality food.
,,,,,Little Goat Diner is super cute. 
,,,,,"Plenty of bar seating, and it's so light, airy and spacious that it makes you feel like you can hang out. With our group of 6, though some of us were standing, it still felt comfy. "
,,,,,"Drinks are right along what you would expect from the Randolph street area: ~$15/drink. You can't fault them for it, but I do always hope they're a little cheaper! "
,,,,,"It is super close to Au Cheval, so this is a great place to come and kick back while waiting to be seated over there. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"I loved this place for brunch! The ambience was amazing, the workers were friendly, the food was delicious. They put in a lot of attention to detail with the little goat which could be spotted on the mugs, workers' apparel, and even the receipt."
,,,,,"Their dishes were pretty unique. We ended up going with the Fat Elvis waffles and smoked corned beef hash with eggs. My favorite was the waffles - so many good things going on there. The bananas were at the perfect stage of ripening, the peanut butter mound had a light and fluffy texture, the waffles were fluffy and crispy and had a wonderful flavor. I liked that this dish wasn't overly sweet. It was honestly the best waffle dish I've had in my life."
,,,,,The corned beef seemed to be of good quality. The hash browns weren't my favorite but they were crispy and had some cheese in there too.
,,,,,This place is definitely a winner in my book. Would highly recommend if you're visiting Chicago and would totally go back again myself.
,,,,,I have been driving pass this place for years. It is always packed and seems like a good vibe but I just wasn't pressed to go. 
,,,,,"Last week I decided to indulge and take my friend to lunch there. We made reservations tho. And you should too if going on a weekend. Packed as usually, but we were seated almost immediately. "
,,,,,"This menu is very all over the place so at first glance it could be a bit confusing. There is no clear type of food for brunch you can get American, medeterrain inspired, Mexican inspired etc. I was a bit skeptical but was curious to see what all the hype was about. "
,,,,,We really didn't want breakfast food so we both chose to go with a more lunch brunch. I got the PARATHAS BURRITO which is 
,,,,,"Indian flatbread, chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, mont amore cheese. I swapped my sunny side egg out for egg whites.  DELISH! so glad I got this dish. Very filling, great flavors and healthy all in one. Thank you to my waitress for helping me make that decision "
,,,,,My friend got CRISPY CAULIFLOWER MANCHURIAN with
,,,,,"kale, grits and Manchurian sauce.This was also a delicious dish and a very clean eat. We also had a side of Brussels sprouts. Yummy. "
,,,,,For our last hooray we shared the cinnamon roll. I was a bit nervous because it just looks so sweet but it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The bread portion was so yummy and the icing was a bonus. 
,,,,,Service was good. I didnt get a drink but next time I would like to indulge. 
,,,,,Will go back and try it again!
,,,,,"Pork belly paradise!! Pork belly is my favorite so I HAD to come here. This place is a chic diner that takes your classic brunch & lunch foods and puts a unique twist on them! I'm always on the hunt for fusion restaurants and this place made the top of my list! The portions are massive. Flavors are so bold and tasty. Simply phenomenal. Chef Stephanie Izard is an amazing chef, and I've become a huge fan. I cannot wait to check out the sister restaurants next - Girl & the Goat and Duck, Duck, Goat. "
,,,,,"We started off with the pork belly home fries- they were hot, crisp, and SO savory. It has a fish sauce vinaigrette glaze which gives it the perfect tang. The pork belly is also amazing - so tender with the perfect amount of fatty. Just wish it came with more than a few pieces! "
,,,,,"Then, I decided to be adventurous and get the okonomiyaki - osaka street food with pork belly. It's basically a savory pancake/crepe. But wow, this was so mouthwatering. The crepe itself is SO fluffy! There's crispy little things on top of it that look like Rice Krispies which gave it the perfect crunch- not really sure what they were but they tasted like shrimp puffs/crackers to me. There's also some dry flakes on there which I think was maybe dry squid? On top was a poached egg and delicious sauce which just tied the whole dish together. There is also pork belly on it, but it's more like very very thin slices of it instead of thick cut pieces with fatty, which I was expecting, so I was a little disappointed, but it was still good. "
,,,,,"One of my favorite places to get brunch in Chicago. The combinations are so creative and impressive. For how busy the place was, service was decently quick, there were some times when it was a little on the slower side. Definitely make sure to make reservations so you won't have to wait a few hours."
,,,,,"It's really really just mediocre, seriously. In a city where good food is everywhere, your money and time are literally better spent pretty much anywhere else. Of all the goat restaurants, the girl and the goat is the only one to consider going. All the other ones are opportunistic traps. They operating at 25% right now. Reservation was really difficult to get but I managed. I felt so lucky at the time. Arrived and was seated on time, took a while for the server to return to get our order but it's fine since then. My only issue is with the food. Wife ordered this little piggy went to China and I got a side of bacon and hash browns. Her dish was literally a cheddar biscuit, a sausage patty, egg, some blueberries in some Asian inspired sauce $17 and my dish was just bacon and hash brown. 4 strips of thin bacon was $7 and hash brown was $8. No flare or anything. Stuff you can get better at IHOP. Never mind that, come to my house, I'll make it better for you. Maybe it's because I'm Asian so it's harder to wow me with any Asian flavors but I promise you I love Asian fusion food. And it's not that I'm cheap, in fact this whole trip is about nothing but food for us. But really it was just meh, I seriously regretted coming here. I gave up other spots at other restaurants to come here. I regretted using my limited time in Chicago to eat here. My wife said it was a waste of her holiday too. Where was the top chef level creativity? Where was the wow factor? Where was the pride and love in your dishes? Am I expecting too much? I don't think so. I wanted to be able to brag about this place but now I'm afraid people would make fun of me if I mention coming here. Eat something else, anywhere else."
,,,,,Unpopular opinion here- but I wasn't that big a fan of this place.
,,,,,I came here really excited to try it and with expectations because the menu looked awesome and so did all the reviews below. 
,,,,,"I'll start with the good- the host was really nice, our waiter was attentive and helpful, and I loved the space. Warm, cozy, and friendly atmosphere and I love that they have booths."
,,,,,"For the food, I was really interested in a lot of it because of the Asian components they infused in it (pork belly, tonkatsu, kimchi). "
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I split the pork belly pancake, los drowned, and pork belly home fries. I will tell you that the pork belly pancake is small ($13) and not a lot of pork belly at all. The los drowned tasted okay but for a sandwich $14 was pricey. As was the $8 pork belly home fries which didn't come with much either. I found that everything was really greasy and heavy and not in a good way. I barely got through the pork belly pancake and I can EAT. Everything tasted so oily and/or salty. And the idea of infusing Asian flavor with American classics was a great idea but I think the overall end pieces fell rather flat and just didn't go well together. "
,,,,,"I think I might go back simply because the menu was pretty extensive and I would like to give it another shot, but I wasn't impressed the first time around."
,,,,,"Super cute diner in the west loop, and sooo good! I've been here maybe 4 times now and each time doesn't disappoint. They have a unique selection, but I love the Okonomiyaki, which is like a pancake with pork belly on top with scallions and more. I've also had their shrimp and grits which is pretty good. But if you're gonna get a side, you must get the pork belly home fries, they're amazing! Overall great food, nice aesthetic, and friendly staff"
,,,,,"With over 4,000 reviews, I'm sure Little Goat doesn't need mine, but here we go. Had a reservation for 2 on a Tuesday night at 6:00pm. We split the pork belly home fries, the tonkatsu, and the los drowned. "
,,,,,"I have to say the pork belly home fries were delicious and flavorful and came with some sort of aioli sauce and a darker sauce and they were REALLY good. My complaint though, was that there wasn't enough pork belly on them. I think on the whole dish there were only 4 pieces. They were so good that we wanted more. "
,,,,,"The tonkatsu was pretty mediocre and not really much to write home about but I think that's because the LOS DROWNED was SO DELICIOUS that it overshadowed everything else on the table, honestly. It was so juicy and so flavorful, very Stephanie Izard - punched me in the face with flavor. Really good. I wish I had it in front of my right now actually, because I'd eat it again."

,,,,,"unique, creative and blast of flavor is what little goat diner is all about ! Best breakfast in Chicago hands down ! Went for Sunday brunch and the wait was only 20 min with open high tables so that really struck my eye ! Especially because Sunday breakfast always starts with a 45min - 1 hour wait! The waitress and the staff were very friendly and helpful when it came to choose what to eat. The food is so flavorful and I went in not very hungry and left wanting more !  Hope to come back and try more! I was able to sit in the high tops and was able to see all their foods and honestly there wasn't one dish that looked boring and didn't look amazing "
,,,,,Highly recommend:
,,,,,Chai Tea Latte
,,,,,This little piggy went to China
,,,,,Bulls eye French toast
,,,,,Biscuits and gravy were yummy.  Has a great outdoor patio that has some shade.  Overall the staff was fabulous.  Make sure to make a reservation!
,,,,,"Thank you, Christine! All of us at Little Goat are glad to hear that you enjoyed our biscuits and gravy and we really appreciate you taking time to post a review. Hope to see you again soon!"
,,,,,Super solid... the only thing i would complain about was the wait in line...
,,,,,"The food was great, the service was great. "
,,,,,my favorite was the vibe - I wish they had places like these in Seattle!
,,,,,the lamb was very well done and the selection of wines were super awesome!
,,,,,"I had a really impressive dining experience at Little Goat Diner the last time I ate there. I met up with my friends for a late lunch a few weeks ago, and this happened to be one of the first restaurants I went to where I had to order based on a food allergy. Having recently been diagnosed with an intolerance for onion and garlic, I had a difficult time navigating the menu to figure it out. Our waitress was SO patient and understanding. She and the kitchen worked really hard to diligently find the perfect dish for me that did not have any fresh onion or garlic. As it turns out, it's in EVERYTHING, so this was not an easy task. She had me select 2-3 menu items that looked appealing to me, then she checked back with the kitchen to see if they could make a version of it without onion or garlic. "
,,,,,"I ordered the chickpea salad (modified for me), and it was SO SO good! I'm still getting used to not being able to eat like I used to so I was skeptical anything could be good without onion or garlic. At Little Goat, that's luckily not a problem! Little Goat continues to be one of my standby favorites in the West Loop area. Even though there are a lot of dining options in this area, I really appreciate the big menu, the location, the reservation availability, and the quality of food. I will 100% be back!"
,,,,,"I've been here twice: once the day after I competed in a triathlon (you can bet I was still hungry the next day) and the other this past weekend with my boyfriend. I'll focus mostly on my most recent dining experience here because it's most salient. It was a Saturday at around 6, which is prime time for dinner. The last time I had come to Little Goat, I had had a reservation, so I had reservations about coming without one (heh). We actually originally had put our names down for dinner at Au Cheval where the wait time was THREE HOURS. We were already hungry and Little Goat was also on our list of places to go in the West Loop, so we thought we would drop by to see if the wait time was better. And it was! Much to our excitement, we were seated immediately at the bar at Little Goat. Score! "
,,,,,"Service: Service was a little bit spotty. Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive to us and, oddly, she absentmindedly filled my water glass, leaving my boyfriend's empty, then filled his maybe 10 minutes later. We were able to flag her for the check in a reasonable amount of time, so there were no other issues."
,,,,,"Food: I decided on the white fish chilaquiles for something different (normally I would head straight over to the all-day breakfast food part of the menu). Last time I was here, I got a portobello mushroom burger with shoestring onions on top and it was incredible. The chilaquiles were amazing, too, complete with salad on the top. I was surprised at first when these came out of the kitchen because it looked at first like it was just a bunch of salad! I really enjoyed my main entree. We also had ordered brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be an appetizer. I would have preferred to receive the brussels sprouts before our meal, but it came out as a side. The brussel sprouts were disappointing. They were cooked perfectly, which is not always the case for brussels sprouts. However, they were MUCH too salty. I would definitely not order these again. It was not palatable at all! Even though I love Girl & the Goat, I also found a few of the dishes to be way too sodium-laden for my tastes, which was consistent with Little Goat. "
,,,,,"Overall, we had a great experience. We both really enjoyed our entrees and were eager to try the breakfast part of the menu next time!"
,,,,,"When visitors can't get a reservation at Girl and the Goat, they always ask me about Little Goat. I always tell them to check the menu. I wouldn't say Little Goat is a go-to, but they do have a solid menu. They have traditional things that diners usually do, but also an asian fusion. Just gotta see whether it piques your interest or not. For breakfast, I enjoy the chocolate chip pancakes, they're fluffy and not too sweet, which is the problem I encounter a lot. "
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Otherwise, what I usually order for brunch or lunch is the okonomiyaki, which is sort of like an asian pancake with pork belly and bonito flakes on top. If you're feeling a tad adventurous I'd recommend this! Little Goat is more often packed than not, so if you can, make reservations ahead of time! When you can't, put your name down and hang out by the bar! I usually stop by for a Sofie while I'm there. Not sure how often they rotate their beers!"
,,,,,I was EXTREMELY impressed with Little Goat Diner. I had become familiar with it through a photographer friend's photos and finally got to try it for a bachelorette brunch!
,,,,,We made a reservation (recommended) and were seated at a communal table. The service was fast and friendly. Our server was very informative and handled the big group professionally.
,,,,,"The portion sizes are HUGE. If you order a side, it is shareable between 2-3 people, specifically the hash browns and cinnamon rolls! Everything on the menu sounded amazing, I wish I could've ordered one of everything. I ended up ordering ""This Little Piggy Went To China"" which is asian cuisine inspired. The flavor was incredible...I honestly don't even know how to describe it! My friend ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast and I can say the same as before, so flavorful and delicious that I can't even find words to describe!"
,,,,,I loved the decor and theme of the restaurant. Huge fan of all the natural light. The bathrooms were very nice too!
,,,,,Parking is tricky here. I suggest taking advantage of their valet service or walking if possible.
,,,,,"I so badly can't wait to try the owner's many other restaurants, but this one gets a 12/10 in my book!"
,,,,,"Great location and atmosphere, loved the sun roof and overall vibe of the Diner. They have a great menu with lots of options and not your typical breakfast foods. My bf got the French dip sandwich and loved it. I wasn't crazy about the fishy tasting seasoning they put on their fries and wish I could've opted out of that but otherwise everything was great"
,,,,,Isabelle - A big thanks to you and your boyfriend for dining with us at Little Goat! We are very glad to hear that you enjoyed your visit and we appreciate this feedback regarding your fries as well. Have a wonderful week!
,,,,,Safety first at the Little Goat Diner! 
,,,,,"That mask must stay on at all times unless you are ""actively eating"""

,,,,,Never knew you could eat fries for breakfast
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,I've never had a dish I didn't like. The addition of interesting desserts from sugarcoat is a nice twist.
,,,,,Please bring back the shrimp and grits!
,,,,,We love hearing your resounding support for our menu! It's wonderful that you've enjoyed our collaboration with sugargoat as well. We'll be sure to pass on your requests for shrimp and grits to the Chef! We're grateful for your support of Little Goat and hope we'll see you in our dining room again soon!
,,,,,Excellent spot for elevated diner classics.  Some gluten free options too. I had the braised beef sandwich on corn tostadas and it was excellent!
,,,,,Enjoyed an almond milk latte and Cinnabun. I got distracted and didn't realize the restaurant closed - the team was very courteous and waited until the very last minute possible to ask me to leave. Appreciate it!
,,,,,Thank you for stopping in Fabiola! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your latte and cinnamon bun. A sweet treat and coffee are the perfect combination here at Little Goat. We can't wait to see you again for another tasty meal!
,,,,,"Had a great brunch at Little Goat on a Friday morning/afternoon.  We had reservations for 1:30 and I am glad we did.  The place was packed and there was a wait, but I am not sure how long it was.  We were there 60-90 minutes and it stayed hopping the entire time.  But, we were seated promptly.  So, make a reservation if possible.  "
,,,,,"LG Diner has a strong beer list with craft entries both local and from around the country.  We had a couple of location recommendations from our server and were not disappointed.  There is also the requisite brunch cocktails, but we stuck to brews so I cannot comment on their quality."
,,,,,"To eat, I went with the tonkatsu, a breaded pork cutlet sandwich with asian BBQ sauce, mayo, and cabbage served on white bread.  I should point out it was really good quality white bread.  It may look like the store-bought stuff but it was good.  The sandwich is also enormous, it's basically 2 full sandwiches, I highly recommend sharing.  And, I highly recommend ordering this.  It was excellent, the pork is crispy but not greasy and was not dried out.  The sauces were complementary but didn't overtake the sandwich.  The bread held up its end of the bargain and the entire thing didn't fall apart.  It was just a really good sandwich, one of the better things I ate during my 5 days in Chicago.  "
,,,,,"On the side, I had the pork belly home fries, which need to be in your life now.  They are served with (not enough) pickled peppers, cilantro, and a fish sauce vinaigrette.  I asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and some were but not all.  The pork belly was cut into large cubes and was cooked perfectly.  We also were delivered an order of fries to our table mistakenly.  They were thin fries, and good.  Not the best I've had or anything, but a good and simple quality fry."
,,,,,LG Diner is worthy of its association with its big sister restaurant.  I would return on a future visit.
,,,,,Went here for Saturday breakfast. They open at 7 and it was already hopping by 8. They serve the entire menu all day and I wanted to get a taste of both their breakfast items in addition to their other fare.
,,,,,"I ordered the goat burger bahn mi style, medium rare. The meat was extremely tender and perfectly cooked. The bun was a buttery brioche and the toppings certainly added an Asian vibe to the burger."
,,,,,"I also ordered the smoked corn beef hash with 2 sunny side up eggs. The runny yolk poured over the crispy hash browns and thinly sliced beef. Unlike a lot of other corned beef hashs I've had, this was didnt use cubed potatoes inundated with peppers and mushrooms. They certainly didn't skimp on the beef."
,,,,,"Overall delicious meal. One of the best meals I've had in Chicago was at the sister restaurant Girl and the Goat, so was not disappointed."
,,,,,First of all the portion size is huge and the prices are very reasonable. The pork belly pancake I ordered was really good until I ate half of it. Perhaps this is just me who feels this way but I felt like the food overall was very heavy. Perhaps because they give too much food. It's great from the value standpoint but all 4 of us left food in the end and it made me wonder a bit about what if this place lowers the portion size and the price? But I always think about that everywhere I go.... regardless this is a great option. I heard their breakfast is great so maybe I should come back for that. I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. It's better than 4 stars but a bit less than 5 stars
,,,,,"I stopped by for breakfast before my flight out and I'm soooo glad i did! I had read and heard about all the great food here, and I finally got to try it."
,,,,,"I ordered the Little Piggy went to China and wolfed it down in 10 minutes! It was so flavorful and unique, loved the combination of flavors. The spice wasn't too overpowering and the bit of sweetness was a welcomed taste."
,,,,,I also ordered a cinnamon roll and the scallion pancake with pork belly to go for the plane. Both were still delicious a few hours later! Chicago really does Asian fusion really well and I was super impressed. I can't wait to come back and try other breakfast entrees as well as the Girl and the Goat.
,,,,,This is America
,,,,,5 stars
,,,,,This place blew it out of the water! We came in right before heading off to the airport and they offered to let us keep our bags at the front. The service was incredible and the food came out very quick for how complicated the dishes were. 
,,,,,"We both got the Little Piggy went to China dish, which was mind-blowing. The pork sausage on the biscuit was incredibly well-seasoned. You could taste the lemongrass and ginger throughout and the mala (numbing) Szechuan pepper came through nicely at the end and was surprisingly not too spicy! The gooseberries also gave the dish a nice citrusy touch. The dish did, however, get saltier as you ate it. "
,,,,,"The okonomiyaki was lovely, especially with the poached egg. It was fluffier and more doughy compared to a typical okonomiyaki and more reminiscent of a pancake, which made it very suitable for brunch. "
,,,,,"The decor was also very nice, and I loved that they have booths! Will need to go back to Chicago just to eat here!"
,,,,,"Salty is the best way to describe the food here. We had the This Little Piggy Went to China, Okonmiyaki, Pork Belly Fries, and Pork Belly Pancake. The Little Piggy Went to China was the saltiest of the group. The Pork Belly fries were good. The Pork Belly Pancake (scallion pancake with a slab of pork belly and coleslaw on top) was good and less salty although it wasn't the best scallion pancake that I've ever had. "
,,,,,Our server was very nice and service was good for a busy Saturday lunch.
,,,,,Casual meet up with friends? Easy family dinner? Chill first date? Eating alone? This place is for you!
,,,,,"First tip: Make a reservation, as chill as this place is, you're going to want a set time."
,,,,,"All the Goats are in one area and I've actually hit them all up in the same night thanks to mainly my first tip. Little Goat is a great place to start at. It has this fun diner vibe with a mix of breakfast/lunch/anytime/Asian inspired items on the menu. Their menu is also puny (e.g. Cereal Killers; I'm such a sucker for puns) and has a section dedicated to potatoes (Tater Town) so you know this place is already going to be good. And with a name that includes G.O.A.T., it sets the bar high."
,,,,,"My favorite thing to eat here is a savory dish with a breakfast dish. Breakfast is ANYTIME at this place. Add a nostalgic soda shop adult beverage and I am set! Any of the pancakes are good (dark choco chip crunch yassss and I'm getting sourdough next time) and I'm pretty into their take on jap chae. I always get the umami mayo on the side though because I grew up in Hawaii and I cant do mayo on my noods. I've tried the nachos and while they were good, my stomach real estate is limited so I could probably skip. What you really should do is get the Grown Up Malt and thank me later."
,,,,,"Second tip: If you cant get in the restaurant, at least go to the bakery which is connected as well. If I weren't so full every time, I would order all the pastries (looking at you Cinnabun) because those look solid. I mean it's attached to their bakery. That indicates to me fresh and homemade. "
,,,,,"Third Tip: Parking in this area can be rough on a weekend so Uber if you can. You could probably spend the whole night eating and bar hopping before you go home so why not Uber over. If you are foodventuring, other places to hit up in the same night: Bombas, the other Goat restaurants (and the side window of Duck Duck Goat if the right season), and McD University (a novelty)."
,,,,,Now go forth and eat!
,,,,,Another fiver! This spot did not disappoint. Our waitress was warm and knowledgeable. The diner was bright and very casual. We didn't have to wait long to be seated after we put our name in.
,,,,,I love how many sweet and savory options they have- I ended up getting the Bull's Eye French Toast for myself and it was even better than I thought. There is a sunny side egg in the French Toast. The fried chicken was flavorful and crispy which added a nice contrast in texture and there was a sweet and light syrup on top that really pulled the whole dish together.
,,,,,"I also tried the Pork Belly Pancake which was so good if you're looking for something more on the savory side. It's not your traditional pancake, it has an asian twist and has a nice crispy texture."
,,,,,"Definitely recommend stopping by, you will not regret it."
,,,,,"My wife and I came here because we were quoted a wait time at Au Cheval that was beyond the pale. Little Goat Diner told us 20 minutes, so we went for it. While we waited for our table, we went to the bar and had a drink. As expected, we were seated after a short wait."
,,,,,"I had the corned beef hash. It was decent, but nothing special. My wife had a burger. She had the same feelings about her food."
,,,,,"Overall, we didn't dislike Little Goat, but we didn't love it either."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Made a reservation here because the reviews for the Goat restaurants are all quite good and we also had a vegan (my fiance) in the party.
,,,,,"Please take note - as of 5/2021, they have completely done away with their vegan menu!!"
,,,,,"We tried to get more vegan options and were told that the veggie burger could be subbed in for regular burgers or there were salads that were vegan. My fiance ordered the chickpea salad and said he would add a veggie burger patty to the salad to beef it up. The waitress said he really didn't need to do since the chickpea salad included their veggie chickpea burger (I honestly think she was trying to say that because the salad had chickpea in it, he didn't need to also order a chickpea burger). Fast forward to when the food arrived and there was no veggie burger. We ordered it on the side after explaining that the waitress had said it would be included. The manager brought over the veggie burger and apologized. After it was half eaten the manager came back over and said someone had ""just informed"" him that my fiance was vegan and that the veggie burger was not actually vegan. Yikes. He comped the burger (not even the entire salad after the debacle). "
,,,,," The rest of the food was honestly just ok. I had the Fat Club which, as far as club sandwiches go, was pretty damn basic except this one costs $18. My brother and sister-in-law both had the Korean Chicken Tacos. My brother wasn't impressed. They also got the crab dip which I have to say was more cream and not enough crab. "
,,,,,All around this was a just ok experience. I wouldn't go back and I don't recommend it.
,,,,,"So without a clue I was looking for a brunch space that was within walking distance from my hotel, whipped up Yelp which pointed me to this place. I didn't care for it either way but I had no idea that it was associated with a local celeb chef (I know nothing of the reputation), nor how wildly popular it was--a local rideshare driver who took me to my car rental place and frequents the West Loop area for coffee told me she didn't like Little Goat Diner because of its popularity and recommended I try another place nearby (by then it was too late and I was on my way out of the city--the way she presented LGD made it come across as something similar to the endlessly popular Mildred's Temple Kitchen or Lady Marmalade back in Toronto, and honestly at home I might be the same to others)."
,,,,,For what it's worth though I actually liked this place.
,,,,,"It wasn't even busy on my Sunday visit, though for a large diner it did fill up quickly (not to the point of lineups). The funky punny menu goes all over the world for inspiration for their western diner fares. I had a few small things, a milkshake. The standout in my meal is ""This Little Piggy Went to China,"" eggs complemented with Sichuan pork sausages, and it was all crazy with sweetness and spiciness and other flavours that are all over the place like east meets (mid)west. Oh so good!"
,,,,,Certainly do not regret coming here.
,,,,,Another good find in Chicago. Make reservations because it will be busy. It is a go-to among the locals especially during brunch. The menu changes every now and then but many of the classics stay consistent. It is American but there are elements that make it a fusion restaurant (e.g. kimchi). 
,,,,,Ordered 
,,,,,"- Los Drowned (4.5/5). This was surprisingly good for a hoagie. A nice meaty sandwich that has braised beef, a kick to it with the pickled peppers and onions and some mayo sauce drizzled all over it. It sounds heavy but the meal was just right. The flavors were intricate and I made sure to enjoy each and every bite. "
,,,,,"Fiancée ordered the Chop Chae (glass noodles, veggies, sunny egg, mayo in a bunless fashion) that was hella good as well. "
,,,,,Great place and can't wait to return and try other eats!
,,,,,VEGAN HEAVEN! Don't forget to ask for a vegan menu or you wouldn't know it existed since you can't find it online - would be great for them to add it to their website to get some credit for the creative vegan offerings. 
,,,,,"You can't go wrong here but it's a popular spot so make a reservation in advanced (they're on Open Table). Today, a Sunday, I was able to walk in at 1 and sit on the bakery side, which is first come first served. "
,,,,,I go to the Little Goat Diner every time I'm in Chicago because it's just so delicious regardless of your lifestyle choices. If you're vegan and your friends are not this is the perfect spot for all of you to have a mind-blowingly delicious meal. Any of the goat establishments are fantastic for you AND your carnivorous friends. I am so appreciative that they offer a vegan menu at all their restaurants with inventive options. Every dish is a work of art and you can tell there is so much love that goes into every item on the menu. Yay for vegan dishes not being an afterthought or completely forgotten!
,,,,,Vegan people - they are extremely transparent about the fact that they don't have a dedicated fryer. If you're not into this you can easily avoid anything fried.
,,,,,"I have ordered the scallion pancake twice. It's so flavorful, savory, fresh, and unique. The bi bim bop veggie bowl is also fantastic. Today I ordered a veggie burger on a bed of rice noodles and mushrooms which was topped with avocado, thinly shredded carrots and cabbage, pickles and a delicious, flavorful aoli. We also got the smoked fries which were perfectly fried and seasoned to perfection. "
,,,,,My non-vegan friends have always had good experiences here as well.
,,,,,Little goat is so good! The food is super tasty but the best part is the great customer service. So we sat outside and ate with our daughter and the people were so kind. They brought out games for her to play with and made sure she was comfortable even though we were outside. The food came really fast and it was so tasty! Don't forget to order drinks! This is a fantastic place to go!
,,,,,"I really enjoyed my first experience eating a wonderful breakfast bat Little Billy Goat! The staff was gracious to this new customer. I needed a good meal after fasting for over 12 hours for an appointment. The food was tasty, filling, and good. If I would have had my coffee refilled consistently, then there would be 5-stars on the board. Anyway, I know that I'll be returning for another good experience!"
,,,,,"Being super fans of Girl & the Goat, we've been dying to try this brunch joint. This is a delicious brunch spot if you're hankering for something savory! "
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went to China - very savory and tasty.
,,,,,Los Drowned - from the braised beef to the avo to the havarti cheese it was perfection. If you don't like juicy sandwiches with au jous this isn't for you. 
,,,,,Bulls Eye French Toast - Omg the fried chicken. To die for. 
,,,,,Drinks: Kimchi Bloody Mary. YAS. If you're a bloody fan then I highly recommend this. 
,,,,,Service: Excellent
,,,,,Stephanie Izard killing it as always. Will be back for the pastries.
,,,,,"Everything isn't a slam dunk anymore. Half the time, it's a bank shot and occasionally even an airball.  "
,,,,,"I used to really love this place, but it's been a few yrs. Is Stephanie Izard just spread too thin to give time to all of her restaurants? All of them have lost some of their shine. "
,,,,,"The Machos Nachos are still just as good, but our last order was sparse. So much that I did a double-take when they came out. Where are the rest of our nachos?? The Rueben so fatty it was just a greasy hot mess. Her burger was way overcooked. Disappointedly holding it up to me, she pointed out that there was no pink left in it at all."
,,,,,"She picked LG to celebrate her 9th bday; it's almost always been her restaurant of choice for her big day. But this time, they brought her a very well done burger that was too tough to bite into. She referred to it as a ""Trump"" burger. (Extra points for her wit) "
,,,,,"I've always loved the service here and I still love it the same. I've eaten here countless times and without fail, every server has worked tirelessly and with a friendly smile. They once even sent me home a kids burger on the house, because I commented that she'd be disappointed that I ate there without her. "
,,,,,They offer really great classes upstairs if you can snag a ticket. I've taken those classes several times and they always keep me coming back for more. They're easily one of my very favorite date nights. 
,,,,,"The food has overall taken a hit though. I miss the Little Goat that existed 6 or 7 years ago. When everything was executed perfectly and consistently. For diner food, it was so innovative, creative, and delicious that I used to send almost all out of town visitors there. I still suggest it for families or for people wanting casual fare, but I don't give it a glowing stamp of approval anymore."
,,,,,The Chickpea 
,,,,,"-kale, shredded carrot,pickled onion, sliced radish, mint, mont amore cheese, fried Crispy shallots, tender chickpea balls, tzatziki, chee vinaigrette "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"The Chee vinaigrette is pungent and unique flavor i've never tasted before, but Counteracts with the chickpea ball that's mild and light while Tzatziki sauce enhances the chickpea with its creaminess. The is quick pickled onions add a crunchy bite. The ""bowl"" just makes you go around in circles. And each component builds on each other to make you want more"
,,,,,SO.DELICIOUS!  My friend an I decided to try Little Goat Diner after looking at online reviews and drooling.  
,,,,,We came in at 9:40 and and couldn't believe how jam packed LGD was. We were told we'd have to wait 45 minutes but it could be less if we were open to sitting at the diner counter. We said we were open to it and were seated in 30 minutes or a little less. 
,,,,,We ordered the Naan your average crudité platter to share. all three dips were delicious! I could have easily inhaled this all if I wasn't being judged by my friend. 
,,,,,"For my meal I ordered a veggie burger, and cheerwine. Yum! The bun was soft, the veggie burger itself was so flavorful, I would order this again. "
,,,,,"Not pictured: a giant stack of heavenly carbs, I mean, fries."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,(Pre covid visit) My only issue with the goat franchise is that all the food is SO SALTY!!!!!! WHY!!! There's so much potential and the presentation is great but my blood pressure increases by 10 with each bite.
,,,,,The food here is so good!! We spent a long time looking through the menu since so many of the dishes sounded so tasty and we wanted to try them all haha. We came here for dinner but the menu definitely seems more geared towards brunch. Thankfully they serve all day breakfast!
,,,,,We got the machos nachos to start and those were great! The nachos are loaded and the chips are thick and crispy. For my main dish I got the Little Piggy Went to China and it was reallyyy good!! I'd definitely recommend getting this dish since the Sichuan flavors with a classic cheddar biscuit pairs so well together. I also got to try some of the shrimp and pork belly noodles and this dish was good too. I liked how mushrooms were mixed in with the noodles to give it more flavor. 
,,,,,I really liked this place overall! I appreciate the spin on classic diner food by bringing in Asian flavors. I would love to come back and try some other dishes since so many of them looked so good.
,,,,,"The little goat is a 10 out of 10 every time. Each time I go I get the ""The little piggy went to China."" This dish is incredible! It is the perfect combination of sweet savory and spicy all in one. I couldn't ask for a more delicious breakfast meal. Another good option is the bull's-eye French toast which is piece of French toast with egg in the center and crispy fried chicken and strawberries on top. This is definitely one of their classics. I have also tried some of their sandwiches, which have been pretty good - but I would stick to one of these two options if this is your first time going. They also have pretty good coffee as well with goat milk options in addition to the standard milk and non-dairy milk options."
,,,,,"The environment and service of this restaurant were absolutely too notch. We made a reservation for 17 and they were able to sit us right away. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive! My review is mainly based on what I ordered, which was the ""Los Drowned"" which was a beef sandwich. It was incredibly over chewy and the meat wasn't tender unfortunately. They serve breakfast and lunch which is my  absolute favorite. Many things on the menu look absolutely amazing, but I think I just ordered incorrectly."
,,,,,Note: they have a cake cutting fee of $3 per slice (ex. 15 slices would be $45).
,,,,,"Not worth the hype. Had spicy chicken sammie that had too much going on so it had a blah taste. Little Piggy = yuk! Garlic chili blueberry Asian flavored pseudo Southern biscuit & egg dish. Hot Crab Dip = only lukewarm, very little crab and needs about 4x more crackers to dip, or maybe add some celery sticks.   Definitely crossed off my list, never to return"
,,,,,Fat Elvis Pancakes: I enjoyed it but there's a few things I would have changed. Syrup on the side to keep the waffles crispy instead of coming to me already soggy with syrup. Bacon felt extra. I would rather have much more banana slices.
,,,,,I was exhausted and probably slow in the head but my server was very nice. I like the cozy and spacious interior.
,,,,,got the pork katsu sandwich and it was HEAVENLY. the flavors the moisture and the bun were fantastic. Bun didn't get soggy just such a massive sandwich had to take the other 1/2 home! got the fries too it was so good and so reasonably priced. would recommend!
,,,,,"Hi Parker, it's great to hear that you loved the pork katsu sandwich! We loved serving you here at Little Goat, and we appreciate your kind words about our food! We'd love to welcome you back again next time."
,,,,,Amazing sit with some pretty crazy but absolutely delicious breakfast/brunch options. They open pretty early even during the week so I came here a couple times when taking a few days off work. Didn't disappoint. Just don't get the big glass of chocolate milk because it's pretty heavy and you'll get full pretty quickly.
,,,,,Aw man I really don't want to give this place a salty review (I was really looking forward to this place!)... but this place was so salty. 
,,,,,EVERYTHING IS EVERYTHING CRUMPETS 
,,,,,"No everything is too salty! Smoked salmon was the worst offender. I love raw salmon but by far this was the worst, the saltiest, to the point I really couldn't eat it anymore. It didn't really help the other things in this dish was salty, from the salad with capers to the picked veggies. Crumpet was highly anticipated as well, but it was too greasy, like a fried savory donut. "
,,,,,GOAT MILK --
,,,,,Cool! Where could I get goat milk? But tbh I couldn't tell the difference between regular milk and goat milk! :'( 
,,,,,"This place is way too hyped. Long wait for brunch, though West loop is a nice place to walk and wait around. Atmosphere was nice though!"
,,,,,"Service was adequate.  Patty melt was good.  Chocolate pancakes were ok.  The malt balls on top were interesting. Really it was the Korean tacos that were disappointing for a couple of reasons.  1) if the tacos are soft, say so. The tortillas were exactly like the crappy mission tortillas we won't buy at the grocery store anymore because they are way to thick and get gluey when you chew them.  2) Maybe the chicken had touched gochujang at some point possibly, but the flavor was just not there. Since there was kimchee all over the menu, but not on the tacos, I assumed the point was not to conflict with the gochujang, but since I didn't taste that, anything that reminded me of Korean would have been nice.  Frankly I make significantly better gochujang chicken at home, and this was really disappointing."
,,,,,"By the way,... I just looked back at some of the photos, and many of the interesting looking items that people rave about are no longer on the menu.  "
,,,,,"Ps. I've watched Top Chef since year 1 episode 1 and Iron chef since it was Morimoto, Chen and Sakai in Japan and Bobby Flay was just an asshole who disrespected the kitchen by standing on a cutting board.  I had really looked forward to this meal."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Great spot for a quick delicious brunch! Menu is limited (I'm assuming due to COVID) but it does make it so that your food is delivered quickly. Walk up, order and then sit at the picnic styled seating and enjoy! Music was kind of loud, but also keep in mind you're sitting on the street so that's to be expected. We had the peanut butter and jelly sourdough pancakes (delicious) and the parathas burrito. I have heard that the Oory Gooey Cinnabun is to die for so maybe get that!"
,,,,,Each time I visit Little Goat Diner I want to love it. I just never do. 
,,,,,On this visit the hostess was smiling and super friendly. She sat us right away in a nice  big booth with a street front window. My first impression was great. 
,,,,,The server arrived just as chipper and lively. She offered suggestions and gave us time when we still had not made any decisions. Again I felt like all was well. 
,,,,,It's just that every time my food arrives I'm just not in love. It's always overly seasoned or has a funky unexpected twist. I know - it's Stephanie Izard's restaurant. I can appreciate the big reputation this represents but sometimes simplicity calls my name. 
,,,,,The room looks great. The service is fantastic. And the cuisine probably pleases most. It's just not my favorite...
,,,,,"Perfect for a brunch- great options for eggs, pancake and waffles and some new unique dishes. Loved my choc chip pancake."
,,,,,DH got okonomiyaki which was an interesting Japanese pancake.
,,,,,Little piggy went to China was also delicious.
,,,,,"Reservations highly recommended (OpenTable FTW)! Our party of 6 dined here for brunch and it was definitely an appetizing, filling meal. The menu consists of breakfast and brunch foods with an Asian twist. There's also an extensive drink menu with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages."
,,,,,"I ordered the okonomiyaki, which was fluffy and lighter (than Japanese standards). It was also very flavorful. There wasn't much pork belly in it, which was a little disappointing. One of the guests in our group ordered the smoked corned beef hash with eggs, and there were broken pieces of eggshells in it. Although they comped the dish, we were very observant of each bite we took. I also had the Bloody Mary and I wasn't disappointed, especially since it was spicy."
,,,,,Little Goat is definitely a must try when you're in Chicago!
,,,,,The food was delicious. The waiter was very helpful with choosing a meal. Looking forward to eating there again. Nom nom nom.
,,,,,"My friend and I went for brunch on a Saturday, and they said everything was booked until 8 pm that day. So we ended up doing take out and eating our food at one of the many tables they've set up outside, which we really appreciated. I got the Little Piggy Goes to China and my friend got the Bull's Eye French Toast. Mine was kind of generic and nothing special - it was an open faced cheddar biscuit with an egg, with a side of chili oil/soy sauce(?) that was apparently supposed to be the Asian part in the dish? But I had a bite of my friend's french toast and it was super good. Probably the fluffiest french toast I've eaten in my life. The dishes here are also pretty pricey, and I ended up paying ~$20 for my food that I feel like was worth ~$12."
,,,,,Stephanie put her foot in this ! Omg . Cannot describe the explosiveness of This Little Piggy Went to China. The dish does wonders to the palette and miracles to the soul.
,,,,,"We went for a lunch around 1 PM after booking on OpenTable. After we sat, two of the glasses had lip smudges so we kindly asked for two new glasses. The server acted so rudely she didn't say a word and stormed off after slamming the two new glasses down. We left shortly after she sassily asked us if we were ""taking off"". Bet the food it great but we didn't care to stay. We walked next door to Aucheval where we were greeted kindly with excellent service. Little Goat, you should probably just treat your customers a little better."
,,,,,"Gina - I would like to sincerely apologize for how you were treated during your recent visit. This is not the service we pride ourselves on or the impression we want to leave. We would appreciate the chance to make things right for you, so if you're willing, please call Tina Majethia, Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455. Thank you."
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Their brunch menu is something else, man. American, Meditterean? and Asian fusion, oh baby baby. Highly recommend this spot during the week! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, especially their sandwiches. "
,,,,,For breakfast:
,,,,,Okonomiyaki
,,,,,Paratha Burrito
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went To China
,,,,,For more lunch:
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,"Generally I like the food at the well known and reputable restaurants, especially those with great reviews and ratings.  The food was pretty good here."
,,,,,"The first spot I hit up when I landed in Chicago and it didn't disappoint. The decor is nice, literally little goats all over the place. The staff was friendly and the kimchi burger was absolutely amazing, it's a must have. No pork fries for now but I was assured they'll be coming back."
,,,,,"Kevin, thank you for the glowing feedback! We are so thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your dining experience at Little Goat. We appreciate the kind words about our atmosphere and our Kimchi Burger and are looking forward to seeing you again soon!"
,,,,,"Burger is great, but very messy and falls apart each time I order it. Good diner style food and breakfast at all times. They had a delicious pork fat shake on the menu 2 years ago and I keep waiting for them to bring it back. Usually there's usually a wait to get in."
,,,,,Good brunch but it is pretty basic. The pastries from sugargoat next door are really good.
,,,,,"Hi Julia,"
,,,,,"While we are grateful for your four stars and kudos to sugargoat's delicious pastries, we are sorry to hear we didn't wow you while you were visiting for brunch. We would like the opportunity to learn more about how we can improve moving forward so please consider giving our Assistant Director of Operations, Tina Majethia, a call at (312) 888-3455. Thank you."
,,,,,"Little Goat is Stephanie Izard's breakfast/lunch spot. They are open morning until night, but breakfast is were it is at! "
,,,,,"Street meter parking in this area, $2 per hour. Valet was $16 for 4 hours, crazy!"
,,,,,Came at 8:30 am on a random weekday and surprisingly it was busy. Large indoor restaurant and a few outdoor sidwalk patio tables. We sat outside since the weather was nice and the kiddos drop food everywhere.
,,,,,Service was great. Friendly and nice. Super kid friendly. Food comes out fast.
,,,,,This Little Piggy Went to China - $14 - Great asian fusion take on a breakfast biscuit sandwich. Green onion in the biscuit was a nice twist. I liked the chili garlic dressing. Sausage patty was ok. Egg was cooked perfectly.
,,,,,Pork Belly Home Fries - $8 - Pork belly was NOM! Crispy and fatty. Potatoes were tender. Fish sauce vinaigrette add that nice omami salty flavor. 
,,,,,Farm Egg - $2 - Extra scrambled eggs for the kiddos. 
,,,,,Best breakfast I had in Chicago!
,,,,,"The french toast here is okay. In general, I just feel like breakfast places are overrated and this place is no exception. It was at least a good meal to start the day."
,,,,,"Kevin - while we're glad you enjoyed your meal, we apologize we couldn't blow you away. We will make a note of this feedback, but if you'd like to share any additional detail, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We hope to get another opportunity to impress you in the future. Thank you."

,,,,,"It pains me to update this review negatively but Little Goat has definitely gone downhill. I really used to love this place but my last visit in particular was very disappointing. Firstly, service was lousy. When your waitress apologizes to you numerous times for not doing a good job, you know there's a problem. Secondly, it was way too loud. It's a restaurant, not a club! I want to have a conversation over a meal, not dance on the table. Thirdly, food wasn't great. We tried a bunch of new things this time and didn't love any of them. The chili in particular was so spicy it was inedible. "
,,,,,I would maybe come back for brunch but never again for dinner - there are too many other good spots in west loop.
,,,,,Tonkatsu
,,,,,Reuben
,,,,,Fried Chicken Sammie
,,,,,Kimchi Burger
,,,,,"Great customer care, biggest plus was how quick the food came out! Piggy in China was bomb! Didn't make me tired full just satisfying .. my husband had hash brown he said it could have been less oily but even the oily was clean and pancakes were made perfect just a tap bit too sweet. Above all it was a great experience the place itself is inviting and comfortable and clean"
,,,,,"We're so glad to hear you received swift and attentive service while enjoying brunch with us! It's wonderful to hear that all you ordered was satisfying, and we've made notes of your comments. Thank you for allowing us to serve you something special at Little Goat, and we hope we'll catch you in our dining room again soon!"
,,,,,"I was with 2 other people on a Friday night, trying to eat in this particular area without reservations. All of the other restaurants were well over 90 minute waits, while little goat was 45. They have a bar in the back that is perfect for waiting. I only had a glass of wine, which was good, so can't comment on their cocktails. They texted me after only 30 minutes, and we were seated in a booth. The decor and food are a very well done theme of upscale diner. Our waiter was pretty good and helped guide us through the menu. I ordered the machos nachos and they were amazing. The prices are much more affordable here than at The Girl & the Goat. Overall experience definitely earns 5 stars and I'll be back to try more of the menu!"
,,,,,"Saw some Instagram photos from Little Goat Diner of delicious looking food, so on our trip to Chicago I knew I wanted to try it. To start, make sure to make a reservation unless you're okay with sitting at the counter or the communal tables. We didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a table so we opted for the counter, which was fine, just not a private booth."
,,,,,"Started with coffee and a vanilla latte - both good. Nothing to rave about, but good. Standard."
,,,,,"Food: fat Elvis waffles for me (waffles with peanut butter, banana, bacon maple syrup). Husband got some sort of burrito type dish which was really good but I can't remember the name. The waffles were really good, and really sweet. After a little less than half I couldn't take one more sweet bite. Wow! Will definitely cure a sweet tooth, but next time I'd get a side of hash browns or something to offset the sweetness a bit."
,,,,,"The only small complaint - the food took what felt like forever to come out. It was busy, yes, but even so it felt like a very long time to wait for food. We got our check right when we got our food to make sure we didn't have to wait any longer for that after eating, since it felt like we were there forever."
,,,,,"I loved this salad! I thought it had a variety of flavors, and the service was spectacular. Our waiter was great with recommendations! The entire staff was extremely accommodating and kind as well."
,,,,,"Came here when they just reopened indoor dining services.  Cailin, our server was amazing.  She had great recommendations, very attentive within reason, and always had a smile on her face.  The food and drinks were amazing!  I am so glad they are back open practicing safe precautions. Thank you for the amazing service!"

,,,,,"Long overdue, but tis not like they're really hurting for reviews. I love this place. Been twice (before COVID, but my understanding is they've handled things well since), the staff are lovely and on top of it (especially for a place that's often pretty packed).  "
,,,,,"The food is grand, a bit bigger than your average simple American meal and almost every dish has a little twist.  "
,,,,,"The first time I went I had their french toast, and I love their little twist on it with the egg inside.  "
,,,,,"Second time I had a burger (pictured) and it was beyond worth it, and I really just came to yelp today to share the picture with you so consider this place well reviewed. "
,,,,,"Thanks lil Goat people, I'll be back again some day..."
,,,,,This is the second time I've been to this restaurant. My husband and I always order something the people that work there recommend. It is never something I would initially be inclined to order. It has always been phenomenal. Take a risk try something different. You won't regret it.
,,,,,First visit was inside on bar side. Everything was great including service. Second visit was during covid and we ate outside. It was still great and under circumstances did a great job outside in the cold.
,,,,,"Burger and hashbrowns, Mac & cheese, okonomiyaki.  All pretty good, but not impressive and pretty pricey for what you get."
,,,,,Super delicious. Bacon was made just right. Unique menu and attentive service. One of few spots that offer brunch on a Friday.
,,,,,Carlton - Thank you so much! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your brunch with us at Little Goat and are grateful that you would take the time to post a review. Hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,"Super yummy and quick fast food spot! It's extremely easy to order through their outside window and there's plenty of spots around for high tables, picnic tables, and cute lawn chairs. They also have big connect 4 and cute greenery in their outdoor space located on the street. I ordered sourdough pancakes with the peachy Daly & mimosa. It was all delicious and super fast service! The employees were extremely friendly. Would love to come back!"
,,,,,Little Goat Diner!  
,,,,,"Price: Machos Nachos $17, The Piggy went to China $16, French Toast $16, Tonkatsu Sandwich $16, Pork Belly Fries $8, and Mimosa $10. "
,,,,,Tina's Tip: 
,,,,,"- Don't over order! We had 4 people and didn't have the knowledge that the portions in the mid-west are so much larger! Waitress told us that it was good, but it was waaaay more than we could handle. "
,,,,,- Machos Nachos - MUST GET
,,,,,- The Piggy - Acquired taste for some with the soy saucy taste
,,,,,"- French Toast - One of the most different ones I've every had, it had the inner filling! "
,,,,,- Pork Belly Fries were good only while the pork belly was around. Limited pork belly incorporated. 
,,,,,- Mimosa for the friends. Not refillable. 
,,,,,"- I would come back to try other things, but the pricing was fair with the portions!"
,,,,,"A fun place to dine, with wacky names like Little Piggy Went To China, and a casual comfortable venue."
,,,,,"Little Piggy Went To China was my favorite dish and it really stands out. Runny yoke dripping down Sichuan pork patties, crumbly crumpets, with a wonderful sauce that's amazing in taste, salty, sweet, spicy, tangy and magical umami. Just look at the ingredients and imagine the explosion of flavors: sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, gooseberries!"
,,,,,"Pork Belly Home Fries. Don't think, just get it! Amazing! Potatoes wedges with mayo and perfectly fried crispy and juicy pork belly. "
,,,,,"Bull's Eye French Toast with Fried Chicken & strawberries on top. Not sure about this... Beautiful soft sweet onion brioche with an soft egg within, but the combination of sweet brioche with bbq maple syrup and savory chicken just did not work for me. I thought the brioche & syrup overpowered the dish."
,,,,,"This review is for the post COVID snack bar. First, the team is doing a great job with the protocol. Strict masks required, encouraging spacing between people in line, and a thorough sanitation wipe down on tables."
,,,,,"Second, the food is absolutely delicious. We got the nachos + breakfast burrito and the flavors were top notch. I don't think there is one non-delicious thing on the menu. The food combined with the laid back, safe patio vibe made Little Goat a very enjoyable spot in Chicago"
,,,,,Yum! 
,,,,,This is a fun place to stop in for cocktails and be prepared they serve breakfast all day. The hash browns are crispy rolled potatoes with cheese and perfectly salted. Truly captivated the senses!
,,,,,"The sourdough pancakes are not the run of the meal pancakes, they are fluffy without needing extra syrup, because they are light and airy. The staff is all friendly, helpful and seem to enjoy being there, which adds to the dining enjoyment. "
,,,,,"The restrooms are gender neutral, having single stalls with locking doors."
,,,,,"We were looking for a nice place to just kick back our feet and enjoy life with good food, and trusty Yelp led us here, a place with more than 4000 reviews! This is an indication that there must be something unique here!"
,,,,,"The place to be honest, wasn't as fancy as I imagined, but still nice, modern and a cozy environment. In particular, I appreciate the acoustic ambience, that there are no echos and you can actually hear yourself and the people on your table! "
,,,,,"The thing that really stands out here is the food. The names are fun, energetic and creative, so are the food. The presentations were fantastic and the food were creative, east meets west kinda dishes, such as Little Piggy Went to China, brings a smile and satisfies the tummy."
,,,,,The Pork Belly Fries are out of this world. Definitely do not miss it!
,,,,,"Los Drowned. The bread looks dry but when you bite into it, it is crispy and so soft. The braised beef is amazing in texture, taste and melts in your mouth."
,,,,,"Bull's Eye French Toast: eggs, crispy chicken, sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup... a little too funky for my palatte. Looks amazing though"
,,,,,Kid's grilled cheese. Simple but very tasty.
,,,,,820 W Randolph St
,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Diner style menu with breakfast and lunch served all day...but not your typical diner. 
,,,,,"Creative, fun menu...with interesting twists in standard fare. "
,,,,,"I went burger and fries, colleagues had tacos or omelet. All great reviews from the team. "
,,,,,Service was friendly and fun -- had a little attitude and sense of humor; perfect for the setting. 
,,,,,"Note: restaurant does not have a full bar --limited selection of a handful of beers and wines (and an old fashioned, which was quite good)."
,,,,,"Hi Stephen, thanks so much for eating with us at Little Goat! It's great that you enjoyed your burger and fries and that your colleagues were equally pleased by their meals. See you again next time!"
,,,,,Wedding rehearsal dinner this summer. PHENOMENAL dinner.  We were in the upstairs room and had family style dinner...  Loved all of it (except the desserts).
,,,,,"This is a lovely room, a lovely outdoor deck, lovely service, and fabulous food.  "
,,,,,Imagine the ongoing menu/experience is equally good.
,,,,,"Came to Little Goat for breakfast after a perhaps overly-indulgent night at Wrigley.  There may have been some mild hangover action happening.  Lovely patio seating helped, as did coffee and a mimosa. But more important was the Okonomiyaki (YUM).  Such a perfect, savory breakfast!  And perfect cure for those morning regrets!  Husband got the blueberry pancakes and BFF got the Paratha Burrito.  Clean plate club ruled.  And then we got to swing over to Sugargoat for some cookies for fuel later in the day.  What's not to love?"
,,,,,"I ordered the Piggy to China (17 dollars). The service, ambiance, creativity, and presentation of food were wonderful. I gave 1 star less just because the food was actually pretty salty. I feel like maybe adding something extra on the side to balance it out or put less salt. Overall would like to come back and try other dishes! The hash brown looked wonderful."
,,,,,"We are so pleased to hear that you enjoyed your Little Goat experience, Trisha! Feedback from our guests is greatly valued and we will be sure to keep it in mind moving forward. Thank you so much and we hope to see you again next time!"
,,,,,"Glad I was able to try this spot for their patio dining. I ordered the this little piggy went to China on the server's recommendation. It was very tasty although I did feel like it could have been more substantial- perhaps a slightly fatter patty or something. The flavors were very good though, fusion done well. Service was very friendly. "
,,,,,"At first it was nice and warm by the heat lamp but it eventually burned out and the server though apologetic, had no idea what to do about it. So it was freezing by the end of the meal. No stars off but I was also disturbed to see later that there was a woman without a mask on working on a laptop inside. Kinda defeats the purpose of everyone else wearing masks."
,,,,,Great food. Great service 10/10 recommend!! 1 side feeds 2 people. Great proportion of food all around. Alcoholic drinks are a bit strong if you're not a drinker but otherwise this place is GREAT!!
,,,,,"Dominick, thanks for this great review! We are pleased that you loved dining with us and that you're happy with your meal. See you next time!"
,,,,,Came back for a wedding to Chicago and was excited to revisit this place.
,,,,,"Food is still pretty good, although super expensive and the service was absolutely terrible. "
,,,,,"It took me about 5 minutes to get ketchup, despite the fact there were several staff just standing around talking to each other."
,,,,,Won't be back.
,,,,,Thx
,,,,,"Can't go wrong with this place, everything is so good. My favorites are the Los drowned sandwich (the dip is nice and salty) and the chickpea salad if you want something cleaner and refreshing. "
,,,,,"Smoked fries are good but I wouldn't order them for door dash delivery, they do not travel well.   Rooftop is chill."
,,,,,"Delicious food, great service, clean, and generous portions. Very unique twists on classic diner dishes!"
,,,,,"We're happy we could make a fan out of you, Jillian! Food is our passion, and we're thrilled you could share that with us during your visit. We hope to see you at Little Goat again next time!"
,,,,,"Well it is fried not sure I would say Chicken.  May be dating myself but ""Where's the Chicken?"""
,,,,,"Food is usually amazing, however $16 for fried batter inside of bread is not a chicken sandwich."
,,,,,The best brunch food I've had in a while!
,,,,,My group of friends and I ordered mimosas. I appreciate that the waiter recommended ordering a raffle instead of individual glasses!
,,,,,We tried the paratha burrito - the Indian in me was very satisfied!
,,,,,The kale chickpea salad was out of the world- highly recommend.
,,,,,We also got the pb and j sourdough pancakes to share - delicious and the perfect amount of sweetness since you are somewhat in control of the sauce and butter!
,,,,,Really beautiful patio and just a nice experience.
,,,,,I wouldn't sleep on it. 
,,,,,Run if you haven't been there yet!
,,,,,"Priya, we're thrilled we delivered such an outstanding brunch experience for you! It's wonderful that your server's recommendations were so appreciated and that everything you ordered was so delicious.

,,,,,"Pancakes really good, the This Little Piggy Went To China not so much. Very greasy and soaked biscuit. Didn't love the sauce either. Like a soy sauce, very salty. Like the diner decorations tho. I would go back, just not order that, maybe a coffee, the latte was good"
,,,,,"Hi Denise - Thank you for dining with us. We appreciate this feedback about your meal and apologize that you weren't fully satisfied. We certainly hope you will come back and try another option. If there is anything further you would like to discuss, please reach out to Hunter Geye, General Manager, at 773.314.7711."
,,,,,"The menu focuses on comfort food and is excellent for foodies who don't want to spend a fortune in the West Loop. Part of the Stephanie Izard empire, it's well-designed including some fusion with South Asian cuisine."
,,,,,"Sonia, we are thrilled that you enjoyed your experience at Little Goat! It puts a smile on our faces to hear that you loved the flavors and the atmosphere. We hope to see you back soon to try more of our menu! Thank you for sharing with our team."

,,,,,"If vegan, I recommend calling and asking about the menu - some of the posts on Yelp reference a pre-COVID menu."
,,,,,"Gian, thanks for the great review of Little Goat! We're pleased that you loved our food and that your service was excellent. Thanks for the note about our vegan options. See you again next time!"
,,,,,"I went to Little Goat Diner in March of 2021 for dinner. The great thing about this place is that it has breakfast, lunch, and dinner, all day long  we ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast, which was just okay. It was a little soggy and didn't care for the egg that comes on top. We also ordered the Los Drowned, which was so so delicious. The toppings and bolillo bread really take the beef to the next level. It's accompanied by what seems to be a broth, to help make the bread more chewable. And it's also fire. Highly recommend the Los Drowned."
,,,,,"Walked right into Little Got Diner for a quick lunch! And with no wait time (Friday afternoon), the visit was well worth it! Still holding onto hope they'll re-expand their menu in the future. Regardless, the Los Drowned was SO YUM (braised beef, avocado, havarti, & pickled veg --all to be dunked in the braising liquid ). I would go back for this sandwich! --the Fried Chicken Sammie, not so much (kind of one-note; you only taste the hot sauce & the chicken was thin, not juicy )"
,,,,,Kimberlie - We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed your lunch with us at Little Goat. Thank you for stopping by to post a review! We appreciate this feedback and will keep it in mind moving forward. Have a wonderful day!
,,,,,Great food and excellent catering. Our guests were impressed with the vegetarian menu. 
,,,,,"If dining in, the Fat Elvis waffles are life."
,,,,,Nikki - We are so glad to hear that you and your guests enjoyed the meal! Thank you so much for rating Little Goat five stars and trusting us with catering this event. We look forward to seeing you again!
,,,,,Favorite breakfast spot! Also the Kimchi burger is amazing. We always bring our friends from out of town here.
,,,,,Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoy Little Goat! Your support means a lot and we are always happy to serve you and your friends. We hope to see you next time you're craving our Kimchi Burger!
,,,,,"My go-to for brunch or to bring visitors to! It's been hard to go during COVID but my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago. The little piggy went to China is our absolute favorite and one of my favorite breakfast items EVER. Such a unique blend of spices and flavor, it'll have you licking your plate! The bulls eye french toast is also delicious and unique and another ""must have."" We recently tried the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes which were good but not nearly as unique as other items on the menu. Also very friendly and accommodating staff and I felt very safe with their COVID precautions."
,,,,,"I came here with my sister and our friend on a trip to Chicago. My sister is a vegetarian and the options for her were pretty limited but she chose the avocado toast and enjoyed it. I had the big biscuit and gravy, which was pretty salty but I like salt so I didn't mind. Our friend had the corned beef hash and we all shared the buttermilk pancake. The service was great, I highly recommend making a reservation if you want to be seated quickly!"
,,,,,"Danyel - Thank you for visiting us at Little Goat during your trip! We hope you enjoyed your time in Chicago, and we appreciate you stopping by to share this feedback. If you're ever back in the area, we hope for another chance to serve you!"

,,,,,"Fiancé and I came to Chicago for our engagement photos and our friend living in the city took us to this adorable diner. She's a big fan of the chef who also has two other amazing restaurants in the city (Girl & the Goat, Duck Duck Goat). "
,,,,,"We ordered the Mac and Cheese, Fried Chicken on French toast (their take on chicken & waffles and omg it was amazing, I much prefer fluffy french toast to waffles anyhow), and ""This Little Piggy went to China"" which was definitely the star of the show. Absolutely delicious Chinese American fusion food (speaking as someone who is Chinese American)! I felt like I was tasting a bit of ""home"" flavours and somehow also the comfort of a biscuits & gravy Southern meal all in one. Highly recommend it if you prefer more savoury brunches and can only try one dish while you're here. "
,,,,,"After lunch, we popped on over to the adjacent bakery that recently opened up. They specialise in making these huge, creative cupcakes (Cheez It flavour anyone?) and they are all so delicious. I especially appreciated how they were donating some of the proceeds to an organisation that supports #StopAsianHate. As a restaurant which borrows a lot of Asian/Chinese flavours in its cuisine, it was nice to see their ally ship to the people from these nations. "
,,,,,Highly recommend a visit if you're in town!
,,,,,"My wife and I visited Chicago for a wedding and read all about this place and it DID NOT disappoint. We went on a Saturday morning, it was crowded (like any good breakfast spot on a weekend), but we were seated quickly. Our waiter was terrific and helped us pick two great meals. "
,,,,,"We ordered the ""This Little Piggy Went To China"" and the ""Bulls Eye French Toast"", and they were both terrific. "
,,,,,"Piggy went to China stole the show! The scallion and cheddar biscuit paired excellently with the Sichuan pork sausage, smoked blueberries, and chili garlic chive sauce. I only wish there was a little more chili chive sauce. "
,,,,,Bulls Eye French Toast was super interesting to us. The inside of the bread was a little eggy and it was incredible. The BBQ maple syrup had such an interesting flavor. We would recommend this place to anyone. 
,,,,,"Oh, and they have some great breakfast cocktails! "
,,,,,Huge thanks to Little Goat Diner.
,,,,,"Patrick - A big thanks to you and your wife for dining with us at Little Goat! We really appreciate you taking time to post about your meal and are so glad that you had a fantastic breakfast. If you are ever back in Chicago, please stop by again!"
,,,,,"Of all the goats...this one is definitely the goat. While the entire franchise provides a wide range of dining experiences, this one has great food at affordable prices and is fairly easy to get a table at! We showed up with a group of 5 on a Friday morning and we're able to snag an outdoor table. "
,,,,,The service was super quick and accommodating. Our server made sure to accommodate an infant and that we were all settled. 
,,,,,"While the menu offers a sweet and savory options, most of us were attracted to the same items! It seems like no matter what you get you can't go wrong with these options. Our food came out way faster than I expected and was all so incredibly tasty! "
,,,,,Highly recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area.
,,,,,"We sat out on the patio, and while it was a little chilly, it is a nice street to people watch and take in the views. We ordered the Macho Nachos, the Chicken Fingers, The mac and cheese, the Reuben, and the Goat Almighty Burger. The burger was not the best, but everything else was fantastic! The nachos were my personal favorite but everything was really good too! Can't wait to go back and have some more of the cheesy but tangy nachos with homemade tortilla chips!"
,,,,,"Was advised by a Chicago friend to make reservations and so glad we did. Made the reservation a week before my trip (which was already a bit late...but luckily, we snagged an early breakfast slot). "
,,,,,"Atmosphere was very open, airy, and charming with the diner touches. Service was great. Food was delicious! I ordered the Breakfast Bibimbap and immediately from the first bite, my taste buds were in heaven - flavorful, savory, yet not overwhelmingly salty. My friend got This Little Piggy Went to China and it was a yummy hybrid of American & Chinese cuisine. Very unique. However, I personally found it too salty. I could not eat more than two bites without drinking water. "
,,,,,Definitely recommend Little Goat for a great brunch experience! Flavorful creative dishes you surely cannot find anywhere else.
,,,,,"The dishes were too salty for me, great service but probably won't go back there for a while"
,,,,,"Sandy, it's disappointing to hear that your food was over seasoned. Our kitchen team is always careful to season our dishes in a way that will elevate the flavors and highlight the details of each dish, and we apologize that we missed the mark for you.

,,,,,"Tonkatsu is what I ordered and it was tasty , enough to call it a good breakfast for the day but not enough to go back for the same item . will try the others next time to figure out the buzz about the place. My wife got The Chickpea Salad and it was really delicious. The staff told us that the menu they have now is a limited one page menu , can't wait for them to go back to their three page menu to try their Pork belly Smoked Fries"
,,,,,Chandra - We really appreciate you and your wife dining with us at Little Goat. Thank you for taking time to post a review! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your meal and look forward to serving you again when our full menu is available.
,,,,,The following review is based on experiences before the COVID-19 pandemic:
,,,,,"This was one of the last places I visited before the lockdown started in March. Like The Girl and The Goat, I was delighted with the creativity of the dishes with bold flavors, but with a reasonable price. Like other popular spots in the West Loop, the dining room gets quite busy early on any day the restaurant is open. But getting a seat here is easier (like waiting about an hour instead of several hours) than other well known options."
,,,,,"Despite being very busy, the service was reasonably fast and friendly. You do feel a bit cramped like a busy diner, but it's not unreasonable for a restaurant in the loop. The decor is fairly nice, though it may be difficult to notice this in the dimly lit dining room at night."
,,,,,The food is really the star here - bold and exciting and unusual. Here are my thoughts are the items I tried:
,,,,,"Messy fun fries: Superb... A silly name for an incredibly addictive dish. The fries are perfectly crisp and the mix of hoisin mayo, pickled onions, chile-sesame, and maple sausage is very salty -- but a divine mix of flavors. It has a perfect mix of spiciness with just the right amount of creaminess, and a big dose of umami. It wouldn't be too bold to claim that  eating this dish is a life altering experience."
,,,,,"Crispy Creole Chicken Sandwich - Simple mix of a very crispy chicken thigh with creole spice, tartar sauce, and pickled jalapeno on a hefty bun. The reason why this works so well though is the perfect execution of textures throughout the entire sandwich. The bread is fluffy, the chicken is juicy, the breading is crispy, and the sauce is creamy. This is definitely an elevated version of the chicken sandwich."
,,,,,"Bulls eye french toast - This is definitely not your normal french toast. Filled with a generous amount of fried chicken chunks, loads of strawberries, a thick but fluffy sweet onion brioche french toast -- the bbq maple syrup is the secret that ties all these unusual elements together into a dish that truly represents Brunch. This is another one of those dishes which you can't stop eating, even when you feel full."
,,,,,"Overall, excellent choice for flavorful, exciting dishes at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a special visit."
,,,,,I took a weekend breakfast here.
,,,,,Staff was nice and kind.
,,,,,"I ordered hamburger lomo saltado style,and my partner ordered bulls eyed French toast."
,,,,,"Our dish was huge so we didn't eat lunch..,"
,,,,,Great spot for brunch on the weekend- lots of great sweet options here. I love the pancakes!
,,,,,"We're glad you loved our pancakes, Daniela! Thank you for the excellent review and for joining us for brunch - we hope to have the pleasure of serving you again soon!"

,,,,,"My friends and I actually visited this place in late June and it was a great experience! I'm a bit of a picky eater but I've been trying to branch out more, and I can honestly say that we liked everything we tried. Not pictured but we got the crab dip which was incredible and our waiter brought us extra crackers without us even asking. He was quick, had good recommendations and didn't rush us, but also wasn't too chatty. "
,,,,,"I will say that despite the fact that the menu mentioned the French toast having egg, I completely forgot about it by the time we received it. Come to find out, it was inside the toast. So good and complemented the sweetness of the toast and syrup so well. Having said that, I think if I had to choose the Okonomiyaki was my favorite. "
,,,,,"For dessert, we stopped by sugargoat which is connected to Little Goat. We got the Blueberry brown butter cupcake, the Pancake cupcake, the lemon cookie, the chocolate crinkle cookie (more brownie than cookie!) & the spiced brown butter pecan cookie. As usual, all were good but the blueberry cupcake and lemon cookies were our favorites."
,,,,,"Sofiya - we love that you're branching out and that we were able to expand your palate a bit! We love hearing that our servers anticipated your needs and made sure you were well taken care of. It's excellent that you enjoyed the Bull's Eye French Toast as well as the Okonomiyaki, and given your adventure to try new things we think these are excellent choices! We're very happy that you saved room to stop by sugargoat and tried an assortment of their outstanding sweet offerings. We're delighted that you're supporting Little Goat and we hope you'll swing by again soon!"
,,,,,"Was here pre-covid with a friend and had a really positive experience--great food, ambience, and service. I ordered the ""This Little Piggy Went to China"" and we split the pork belly fries. The former was really good; it's essentially a cheddar sesame biscuit with a sunny side up egg, Sichuan pork sausage, and chili garlic chive sauce. The sauce was slightly overpowering and too sweet for my taste, but the rest of the dish was delicious. The pork belly fries--amazing. Couldn't stop eating them, they were so perfectly crisp and essentially just an elevated form of poutine. They come with pork belly, pickled peppers, cilantro, and a sort of fish sauce turned cream vinaigrette. Sounds weird but they were truly amazing. "
,,,,,"Service was decent, we came with a reservation which is definitely needed here. A Chicago institution through and through and absolutely recommend trying out if you haven't!"
,,,,,"I've been wanting to check The Little Goat Diner for some time now, and I'm glad they finally did. We showed up right when they opened up and had to wait at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being acknowledged. Sometimes I hate being the first. Once we were seated their customer service quickly became better. Our server was awesome and served me some delicious coffee in no time and then soon after our food came out. "
,,,,,"My wife ordered their Bulls Eye French Toast, and I ordered ""The Little Piggy Went to China."" Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I was able to order correctly, and came in very prepared. Never in a million years would I ever imagine I would order a Chinese inspired dish for breakfast. I mean this dish has Sichuan pork sausage and chili garlic chive sauce. Flavors I'm very familiar with, just not for breakfast with some coffee. The dish also came with sunny side eggs, sesame cheddar biscuit  and gooseberries. A very perfectly executed dish. All the ingredients complimented each other perfectly, to truly  rested a flavorful dish. I wouldn't hesitate to order this dish again. "
,,,,,"My wife's French toast was also very tasty. A sweet & savory dish. French toast made from a thick sweet onion brioche covered with eggs, crispy chicken, bbq maple syrup and strawberries. The chicken was fried perfectly and complemented this very sweet dish perfectly. Both entrees looked small on the plate but they were both very filling. "
,,,,,"We left very impressed with the dishes that we both ordered. The dishes are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast/brunch places around town, but you want find breakfast like this anywhere in the city. A truly one of a kind experience. We'll definitely be returning very soon. They do offer other dishes that I wouldn't mind checking out, making it very difficult on what to decide."
,,,,,"Arrived at 12:40 on a Saturday afternoon and was told it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 3 so we put our names down. Got a text at 1:05 that our table was ready so we wakes back and we're seated at 1:15. The indoor dining was hot, barely cooler than outside. A waitress provided water within a couple minutes of seating. No ice so we requested some and it was provided. We ordered the Okonomiyaki, The little piggy went to China, the veggie burger, and a chocolate shop pancake at 1:20."

,,,,,"The Okonomiyaki was ok, light and fluffy, but severely lacking in the amount of short rib included in the pancake to where it was hard to find. 2.5/5"
,,,,,"The little piggy that went to China was slightly better, good flavors, egg cooked properly. The meat patty was somewhat bland though. 3/5"
,,,,,"Veggie burger I was told was good, 3.5/5"
,,,,,"The chocolate chip pancake did not arrive, some miscommunication or misunderstanding occurred. "
,,,,,"Restaurant was clean, a couple fruit flies present, dimly lit, music at reasonable level, but as mentioned above the temperature was very warm (we were sweating). "
,,,,,"May try again for dinner sometime, but I do not think I will be back for brunch."
,,,,,"Hi Jamie, We appreciate that you took the time to leave us a review. We're glad to hear that you got seated in a reasonable time frame and that you were promptly waited on, but we apologize that you were not as comfortable as you were hoping to be. It also sounds like you found some of your dishes a bit underwhelming, and we are sorry to hear that. We strive to ensure that our customers are comfortable and satisfied with their dishes, so we apologize that we dropped the ball. We'd love to have you back and make it up to you. Please reach out to Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455 if you have any further feedback about your experience with us."
,,,,,"Little Goat I love you!!! This is one of those iconic Chicago restaurants that you can't get enough of and bring all your out of town guests to. The food is just absolutely next level delicious. And with a HUGE menu, everyone is sure to find something. I love that this diner is a little American, a little Asian, a little Mexican, but it all works perfectly. "
,,,,,"I come here for breakfast usually because the spiced apple pancakes and dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes are my fave in the city. The Cinnamon Bun and cheesy hash browns are also to die for. But fear not, if the only reservation time is 3pm (likely), the non-breakfast options are incredible too. The Fish Tostadas are unbelievable and the Fried Chicken crispy creole sandwich is right up there is the best chicken shoppes. Once instead of a real meal I just got the crudités platter and I crave it often now - the spreads were so unique and the naan was seasoned like heaven. I've also had chicken pot pie, salads, and the nachos and have never been disappointed. Portions are huge as well. Unfortunately they have a limited menu for COVID times, but the options there are absolutely killer. Do yourself a favor and order!"
,,,,,"Had a very interesting meal here at the little goat diner. They have very interesting dishes, some of which you probably won't find most anywhere. I myself had the onoryamikai (or something like that) it was a scallion pancake, with pork belly, some sweet soy sauce, kewpie Mayo, some crunchy things, and some bonito flakes. It was a very nice combination of flavors and textures. My only complaint with the dish, was the Bonita flakes. They were a strange texture, but more importantly, really overpowered the flavor. My sister had the to tonkatsu sandwich, which was really nice. Had a strong Korean flavor, and great ingredients. "
,,,,,"The service was a bit off, as we all had our food, except my sister. Her food actually didn't come out until the rest of us had finished our dinners. It was handled well though. The dish was removed from the bill. In addition, they gave us lots of free deserts, cookies, cupcakes, and an ice cream cupcake as well. "
,,,,,"If you want to try something different, I definitely suggest checking this place out!"
,,,,,I loved the ambiance here. Our food came out in a timely manner despite it being busy for lunch on a weekday.. the service was excellent. The flavors of the dishes were complex and melded perfectly with each other. The crab dip is really rich and creamy... albeit a little too salty especially in conjunction with Ritz crackers. I would highly recommend for a cute brunch date!
,,,,,"I liked Little Goat Diner better than Girl and the Goat, but this place wasn't mindblowing. We got the This Little Piggy Went to China and the Los Drowned sandwich to share. This Little Piggy Went to China was pretty good - the biscuit and chili crisp were especially tasty. The Los Drowned fell apart with each bite and became a crumbled mess by the end. The broth they gave to dunk the sandwich in was also especially salty. Overall, it didn't feel like it had much depth of flavor compared to the This Little Piggy. By the end of the meal, my mouth felt overly salted by both dishes. I think I would still come back to try some of their other unique breakfast dishes."
,,,,,"We really appreciate the detailed feedback, Bri! Excellent choice ordering two fan favorites to try. It's wonderful to hear our guests appreciate each element of our dishes and identify what works well on the plate and could use improvement. We've made note of the salinity of our brunch items and will review this with our kitchen team. We hope our ingenuity will inspire you to return to Little Goat soon, as we'd love to serve you again!"
,,,,,This spot is so cute. There is so much appeal to a diner that serves all food all day. My sister and I went in for a late lunch on Sunday and you could tell they were understaffed. We were told we would get a text when our table was ready and so we walked around. We never got our text and walked back to check in and our table was ready. The original host had left their shift so we never got notified. Our waitress had taken a while and prioritized tables who came after we were seated. I was disappointed in the service but giving four stars for the amazing food we were served. Absolutely would order both of these items again if we are back!
,,,,,"Brunch vibe was great, but the food was overrated and overpriced. Little Piggy Went to China was too sweet and just meh. Could use so much more flavor and spice. Same goes for the French toast - too sweet. Expected to be blown away cause of all the hype, but wasn't."
,,,,,"Koreen - I'm very sorry to hear that you weren't satisfied with your recent meal. We strive to deliver balanced flavors at a great value, and I apologize if we missed the mark. We will keep your feedback in mind moving forward, and if there is anything further you would like to share, please reach out to Tina Majethia, Assistant Director of Operations, at (773) 415-0451. Thank you."

,,,,,"this place was alright!!! it was crowded when we went (Saturday morning for brunch) but we had reservation so we were seated immediately. the menu is not as big as i'd hoped and the portions are not big either for the amount of money i'm paying. food was delicious, i ordered the korean chicken tacos with masa tortillas (i'm gluten free) and they were flavorful and tasty. i wish they had more vegetarian and gluten free options for the prices they're charging, and additionally, i'd love to see more variety on their menu as well."
,,,,,super good food!!! i came here with my family the atmosphere was beautiful and food was amazing!!!
,,,,,Came back and Ray really took care of us!
,,,,,Very attentive and communicated thoroughly throught the meal.
,,,,,Consider Little Goat Redeemed!
,,,,,"Patrick, thanks for the excellent review of Little Goat! We're pleased to hear that Ray took great care of you and that our team was so attentive. Thanks for giving us a second chance!"
,,,,,"No sure what was wrong with the waiter Adam but he was EXTREMELY rude to us from the time we sat down until we left. He initiated the meal with an attitude. Seemed as if he was in a rush to get off and upset that he had another table. We had some questions about the menu (seeing as how it's changed so drastically ) but the waiter was very short with us, rushing us to order. After bringing water and a drinks to the table we did not see him for the remainder of our meal. Even to clear plates, bring the check or pay. Sarah the manager helped us out. She was very apologetic and accommodating."
,,,,,"Absolutely phenomenal brunch! Been here a few times and it's almost shocking how good it is. Split the okonomyaki and Los Drowned sandwich. The flavors, creativity, and taste - WOW! Both are MUST haves. If I had to pick I'd go with the sandwich but it's so close. Chef Izard and her team are food geniuses. Also, great service as always"
,,,,,"Ben, we're thrilled to hear we've made a regular out of you with our creative and bold flavors that we're serving at brunch! It's definitely a tight battle between the Okonomiyaki and Los Drowned sandwich, but we agree that both are incredibly delicious choices to start your day. Many thanks for your continued patronage at Little Goat and we hope we'll see you again soon!"
,,,,,I had an amazing brunch here recently. The food was incredible. You need to get This Little Piggy Went to China. 
,,,,,Service was attentive and efficient. The drink menu is small- but I think that is a COVID thing. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time- they only have 9 tables right now. They are taking COVID protocol seriously as well.
,,,,,"This review is for delivery during COVID via Caviar/ Door Dash all the way from Little Goat to the Lincoln Park/ Lakeview area  (~20 minute drive away). Kinda pricey for delivery, but thankfully we had a really good Caviar coupon to help offset the costs. A few years ago we dined in and had a great experience, but this delivery experience fell short as more than half of the dishes were just okay. "
,,,,,"If you want to try something new, I'd recommend:"
,,,,,"- This Little Piggy Went to China: Definitely would recommend if you enjoy asian flavors and breakfast sandwiches. This comes with a sesame cheddar biscuit, sunny side egg, Sichuan pork sausage, chili garlic chive sauce, and gooseberries. The sauce comes on the side so it travels well and it's not too spicy (I would even say mild?). Each component is delicious, so even if it starts to fall apart and the biscuit slides off, it'll still taste good. "
,,,,,"- Tonkatsu: The breaded pork cutlet is thin and double stacked. it comes with Asian bbq, mayo, cabbage, and brioche bun. Overall a tasty and balanced dish. You won't feel healthy for eating it, but it's yummy. "
,,,,,"If you're looking to be wow'ed, I'd pass on:"
,,,,,"- Mac and Cheese: Very mild and simple dish. We amped it up with hot sauce. Sauce was creamy, but nothing to rave about. "
,,,,,"- Hash browns: Very fine shred, which was unique. Description says it's cooked on the griddle with cheese, but I couldn't tell. "
,,,,,"- Parathas Burrito: A real head scratcher as it's not much of a burrito and the flavors didn't go together. This is an indian flatbread with chili pepper sauce, avocado-bean salad, sunny side eggs, and montamore cheese. It came with 2 sauces (1 spicy and 1 watery sour one). I had high hopes since this seemed like a winning vegetarian dish, but nothing really jived together and overall it was dry even with the sauces."
,,,,,"Came here for brunch on a weekend mid Covid. They kept capacity low and were strict about masks before, during, and after meals. "
,,,,,The food was good and creative. Not traditional breakfast but we enjoyed it. They had valet parking which was convenient as parking is awful there.
,,,,,"Went to Little Goat for a quick dinner, and it was good but not great. It's casual and quick, and the service was very fast. For food we got the This Little Piggy Went to China, which was the best with a unique take on a breakfast sandwich and I liked it a lot. We also got the Korean Chicken Tacos, which were okay, nothing that special. The Bloody Mary was the same, good but not amazing. Little Goat was good and the food was good, would get the This Little Piggy Went to China again, but there are better places in the area that are more unique."
,,,,,"Hi Sophie, thanks so much for taking the time to leave us a review. I'm happy that you were able to try several of our dishes, but I am sorry to hear that you left feeling unimpressed. I'll speak to my team about your feedback so that we can incorporate it moving forward. I would love the opportunity to have you join us again. I know how great Little Goat can be and would love to be given a second chance to show you this! Best, Tina Majethia - Assistant Director of Operations"
,,,,,Love this place. Been here multiple times and it never disappoints so writing a review. Today I got the okonomiyaki--that was amazing. Also can't go wrong w the rueben or the katsu sandwich. 
,,,,,Clean and reliable place if you want something delicious.
,,,,,"Cat, we're so pleased to hear we're providing the top-notch dining experience we strive for. Thank you for your repeat business and kind words - we look forward to having you visit us again soon!"
,,,,,"Diner quality food at inflated prices. From the menu I think only the little piggy goes to China is the only dish worth the price. Everything else is standard diner fare but more expensive. I was hoping this restaurant lived up the the ""goat"" family level of quality but it seemed that only the namesake girl and goat is worth it."
,,,,,"07/06/21: Very poor customer service! We requested a table outside and wanted to be separated a little from the crowd given the tables were SO CLOSE plus Covid and the scare regarding the delta variant. We asked very politely but they refused to budge and the guy was rude and stern with no apologies at all.. so we walked away. The table we asked for was maybe 2 extra feet away from the crowd, not proving an inconvenience to the establishment at all. For a Stephanie Izard restaurant, this is truly a shame, especially since their attitude has rubbed me the wrong way there and at Girl and the Goat before too. I'm a long time resident of the west loop and with so much competition around, I'm going to choose to not go here anymore. "
,,,,,Ps: it takes ALOT for me to give someone just one star. They really irked us the wrong way.. very disappointing.
,,,,,"Nazneen - Customer safety and comfort are our highest priority here so it's very disappointing to read about your recent visit. I sincerely apologize for the way you were treated. I can assure you that we will address this issue with the right people, and I hope you consider allowing us another chance to deliver a five-star experience.

,,,,,"Chicago, IL 60607"
,,,,,Cute lil place that people recommended for our trip to Chicago. We love to eat brunch so of course we had to go. It was a Wednesday and I made reservations thru the website but when we git there it was not needed because they were not busy at all. 
,,,,,"The place looked like a diner. Clean, fast attentive servers. "
,,,,,We of course had to get what people talked about on Yelp. :)
,,,,,Let's go from least to lost liked. Altho we didn't actually DISLIKE the 1st item... it wasn't exactly something we would rave about and tell people to get. 
,,,,,1) The little Piggy Went to China-- except the happily changed out the sunny side up to a scrambled egg since the hubby hates anything but scrambled. It was presented in a pretty way but after halfway thru the chili garlic chive taste started leave an after taste that we didn't care for much long. We nibbled on the top biscuit. It actually looks like a Red Lobster Garlic Cheddar biscuit :)
,,,,,"2) Big Biscuit and Gravy-- the biscuit was square, which surprised my hubby. We have been places who had giant biscuits... he expected that. Since I viewed it on Yelp prior to the visit, I was not surprised but I can see how he would have expected a giant round biscuit, especially with the ""sandwich"" being a round biscuit. This item was good, I liked the gravy a lot, biscuit was a little hard but gravy helped it. But again, hubby didn't feel it was much of a stand out. (Remember, we are people who go to breakfasts and Brunch often!)"
,,,,,3) a side of Hash browns --- this was the best thing this mornin!!! Definitely need to get this! 
,,,,,"I love potatoes, esp hashbrowns for bfast. The cheese that was used hidden between the shredded potatoes were a nice touch. My hubby loved it and as you can tell, he doesn't give a compliment easily! "
,,,,,"So they didn't offer a military discount but they decided to give us a free cupcake since they didn't have a discount. They had quite a few to choose from but it is not listed on the menu, maybe it changes often. We got a banana cupcake with a lime frosting? Not sure. Forgot the cute name they had for it. We got it so that it wasn't your typical chocolate or vanilla cupcake it was pretty good, unusual and moist!"
,,,,,"All in all, glad we went. It was kind of a trek from where we were staying -- and altho it didn't WOW US-- it was still a good, positive experience."
,,,,,"Sharon, thanks for making the trip all the way to Little Goat and for leaving this thoughtful review. We're pleased that you and your husband enjoyed the breakfast dishes that you ordered. Further, it makes us happy that your server was efficient and that they ensured that you got a free cupcake. Thanks for choosing us for your weekend brunch spot, and we hope to see you back again during your next visit to Chicago!"
,,,,,"Dontcha know it's Good Karma to leave a 5  review for excellent service, delicious food, huge portions and a beautiful atmosphere?"
,,,,,I received all of the above and I haven't been here in ages and so happy I chose to enjoy a decadent lunch this afternoon during an unusually warm Chicago September day.
,,,,,They have a beautiful outside porch with elegant tables and settings. The servers here were extremely attentive and there were many interesting options on the menu to choose from.
,,,,,"I chose a super delicious and healthy kale chickpea salad  with fried falafel balls and Greek cucumber  sauce. The salad was creative, colorful and served in a gigantic bowl."
,,,,,"All the menu items range from breakfast to lunch options like hamburgers  sandwiches,  pancakes  fries, iced chai, tempting desserts and decadent milkshakes."
,,,,,My server Ray knew all the items on the menu and was extremely helpful so I received quick service and was allowed to take my sweet time with my meal.
,,,,,This is the perfect spot for a laid back breakfast or lunch in the heart  of the west loop
,,,,,"Diana, we hope this review brings you all the good karma you deserve because it's fantastic! It's lovely to hear how appreciated Ray's excellent service and expertise on our menu was. We're glad you decided to join us for a lovely fall lunch on the porch and that the chickpea salad was filling and delicious. Your support for Little Goat means a great deal to us, and we're grateful that you took the time to share the details of your recent meal. See you again for another outstanding meal next time!"
,,,,,"The Los Drowned is one of the best sandwiches I've had in Chicago! It's like a French dip with extra tasty add ons - strongly recommend it. I've gotten it one at their location and one to go, it was much better at the restaurant!"
,,,,,"Andrew, thank you for the great review! We want the most for our guests and it is fantastic to hear that you enjoyed the Los Drowned sandwich. We appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback and hope to see you back again at Little Goat!"
,,,,,"Okay I love this place.  The hashbrowns won my heart.  The spanish omelette was so refreshing and tasty.  The little piggy went to china reminded me of why I didn't like ""Girl and the Goat"" (the chili sauce just doesn't work...) but was still good.  And the okonomiyaki was delightful, fluffy, and tasty.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to try the Sourdough pancakes, the bulls eye french toast, and the smoked corned beef hash. 4.75/5"
,,,,,"Food: Let me just tell you, there are some items here that will leave you SO FULL you can't move and others that are like...I could eat more. 4.5/5"
,,,,,"Spanish Omelette: This won my heart.  So simple, so good, so refreshing, the flavors all work so well, the egg was cooked perfectly and fluffy.  Will have again someday.  5/5"
,,,,,Okonomiyaki: This was good but couldn't really taste the pork belly.  It was a bit too dense and wouldn't probably get again but still tasted good. 4/5
,,,,,"The Little Piggy Went To China: The biscuit, egg, pork, smoked blueberries all tasted GREAT.  The chili garlic chive sauce is directly out of Girl and the Goat and I didn't care for it. I think Lao Gan Ma is great, FlyByJing is great, Momofuku is great.  This chili sauce is not very good and doesn't really lend itself to tying everything together.  If the sauce were different, I'd get it again.  otherwise 3.75/5"
,,,,,"Hash Browns: Oh my GOSH this is how ALL DINER POTATOES SHOULD BE.  Perfectly crispy on the edges, fluffy and cheese in the middle, not a single bite was too salty or too bland.  I would come back JUST FOR THIS ya'll.  Just. For. This. 5/5"
,,,,,Ambiance: It's a cute diner with some aesthetics borrowed from the OG G&tG.  I'd definitely bring a date here and family too.  It is a fair bit pricier than a regular diner but the meals are unique and tasty so take a chance!!  Plus its easier to find a reservation here as well :) 4.5/5
,,,,,Service: The service is just as good and they take good care of you.  Nothing spectacular but water was always there and they missed nothing.  4/5
,,,,,"Joseph, this review is amazing! It's wonderful to see such thorough tasting notes and to hear just how much you enjoyed each dish you ordered. We're smiling from ear to ear hearing that you would return just for the hash browns! We will share all of your detailed feedback with our kitchen staff and they'll be glad to hear just how much you enjoyed the flavors. We're so happy to hear that you'd bring a date to Little Goat and family as well! Thank you for brunching with us and we hope we'll have the chance to serve you again soon!"
,,,,,If you didn't get a table at girl and goat and think this will be a similar experience. You are HUGELY mistaken. Girl and goat is by miles better and different. Little goats signature dish little pig couldn't convince. It was too sour and sweet. The salad was too standard. Service was alright. Overall I wouldn't recommend or come back and were pretty disappointed with our visit
,,,,,"We aim to provide an outstanding dining experience and apologize we missed the mark this time. We will make a note of the points you've raised and share them with our team, but we would also appreciate the opportunity to learn how we can improve our service going forward. If you are willing, please reach out to Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455 - she would be glad to address your concerns directly. Thank you."
,,,,,"Food and service was AMAZING. Hannah was our waitress and she was wonderful. If you're looking for a refreshing gin cocktail, the ""Bee's Knees"" is a must have. Ordered the okonomiyaki (pork belly pancake with tempura, scallions, bonito flakes, a poached egg and drizzled in kewpie mayo) and inhaled it. I will say the kitchen staff is on the uppity pretentious side that refuses to do simple modifications (the plate is plated with the poached egg on top, I asked for it to be on the side and they refused)."
,,,,,Had the cookie lovers ice cream cupcake for dessert with some espresso which was the perfect way to end the meal.
,,,,,"Thanks for the wonderful review of Little Goat! We're thrilled to hear that you loved your meal and that Hannah was so wonderful. It's also great that you loved our okonomiyaki. Thanks for the additional feedback about our staff--we will raise this with our team to ensure that our customers are able to get the modifications they prefer. Thanks for your business, and we hope to welcome you back for dinner again soon."
,,,,,Unique flavors for brunch! We were promptly seated when we arrived 30 mins before our reservation which we loved! Had the Indian parantha burrito and it was a lot better than we expected!
,,,,,"We are so happy to have made a fan out of you, Paalika! It was our pleasure delivering an exceptional brunch experience and we hope to see you at Little Goat again. Take care!"
,,,,,"Great customer service, very mediocre food for the price."
,,,,,"As an Asian immigrant, I appreciate every effort that modern American restaurants take to integrate and showcase traditional Asian ingredients in innovative ways. Unfortunately, this was just not the way."
,,,,,"Since my friend was moving away soon, we wanted to stop by this hyped Chicago restaurant. We ordered the okonomiyaki and ""This Little Piggy Went to China"". "
,,,,,"The okonomiyaki was a poor imitation of an Osaka street favorite. The pancake was kind of rubbery, lacked the crunch and refreshment of the traditional recipe which usually includes a shit ton of shredded cabbage. Pork belly was barely noticeable, and it lacked the soul of okonomiyaki - okonomiyaki sauce. It was just... not worth $16."
,,,,,"Also, the little piggy did not go to China. It didn't even go to Chinatown. It probably went like shopping in the ""oriental"" aisle of Whole Foods or something and was like ""omg sriracha! so exotic! Let me mix it with that $10 bottle of soy sauce and slather it all over myself!"" The smoked blueberries were also an extremely weird combo in that salty and spicy sauce. I think it's great to experiment with food but maybe do it at home?"
,,,,,"I do want to give credit where credit is due. The scallion cheddar biscuits and eggs were pretty good. Also, the staff is super friendly and nice, so I'm really sorry I couldn't tell them how I really thought of the food when they asked. "
,,,,,"Please take a trip to Chinatown; there are really great, affordable restaurants there and I hope the little piggy gets some new inspiration!"
,,,,,"Tianni - we sincerely appreciate your honest feedback, and while we're glad you enjoyed working with our team, we apologize our menu fell short for you. We will make a note of the comments you've raised about our dishes - but we would also appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you directly and learn how we can improve our offerings and guest experience moving forward. Please reach out to Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, at your earliest convenience. Be well."
,,,,,"The food here was really good but overall, I was a bit disappointed.  The atmosphere was nice but seemed a bit run down to be honest.  The hostess was really shy but nice but the host seemed to have an attitude and was pretty off-putting.  The food didn't come out all once which resulted in my father almost being done with his food before mine arrived.  We got a short stack of sourdough pancakes, the paratha burrito, and the biscuits and gravy.  All was good but for my money, I would choose the paratha burrito over the other two.  It was familiar but completely foreign to me but it was also so good."
,,,,,You know when they say to never meet your heroes?  This experience was kind of like that.  I enjoyed the food but everything else didn't have the sparkle that I thought it would.
,,,,,"Bryan - I'm very sorry that you weren't more impressed with your visit. We want to go above and beyond for our guests and I apologize that your meal didn't come out at once. I will share this review with our team, and I hope you consider dining with us again so we can deliver a five-star experience. If you would like to discuss anything further, please reach out to Tina Majethia, Assistant Director of Operations, at (312) 888-3455. Thank you."
,,,,,Had the bullseye French Toast... it was good; however super sweet. I expected of a balance of savory and sweet with the bbq maple syrup and the fried egg.
,,,,,"Thank you for dining with us at Little Goat! We appreciate this feedback and will share your review with our kitchen team. We hope you consider visiting us again, and if there is anything further you would like to share, please contact Hunter Geye, our General Manager, at 773.314.7711."

,,,,,Seriously! Why not tell people that they need a copy of vaccination to dine in? 
,,,,,So ridiculous! This is crazy! Spoke to the manager and they said it started on Jan. 3rd. 
,,,,,Inform your clients especially if they make reservations over the phone!
,,,,,"Thank you for your feedback, Mercy - we have made a note of your concerns. If you'd like to discuss this, our Assistant Director of Operations, Tina Majethia, would be glad to take your call at (312) 888-3455."
,,,,,"I gave it a three star because the food is consistent but not the service. First off host was quite rude and their tone was ridiculous. We then ask to speak with a manager and eyes roll. Spoke with a manger but experience was not pleasant. Well I tried, won't be coming back."
,,,,,"I was able to snag a table here for brunch on Friday. Be early, the place fills up fast! I love the way it's decorated on the inside, super bright interior, modern and eclectic. The food was delicious. We got the reuben, okonomiyaki (sorry if I spelled that incorrectly), hash browns and the bulls eye french toast. The reuben was to die for! The meat was so tender, flavorful and delicious. Cheese, sauerkraut and kimchi, I mean it couldn't have tasted better. The okonomiyaki was a showstopper. It not only looked amazing but tasted amazing as well. It was soft and fluffy with crunchy tempura bites. That mayo and sweet sauce on top was the perfect complement. I loved how thin the hash browns were, they were so crispy and the cheese hidden inside was delicious. My boyfriend really enjoyed his french toast as well. Looking forward to coming back!"
,,,,,Janel - It makes us smile to hear that you and your boyfriend enjoyed your recent brunch at Little Goat. Thank you for posting a great review and these gorgeous photos! We are glad to know that the Reuben was a standout. Have a wonderful week and we look forward to serving you next time!
,,,,,"I was wondering what the rave about this place was. But the flavors are so unique with a hint of comfort in them that I want to experiment what all their flavors are like. This little piggy went to China was my favorite. They nail the idea of salt, fat, acid, heat to make a scrumptious combo that's not disrespectful to the Asian palate. The Okonomiyaki was excellent too. A proper homage to the Japanese dish, I think it nails the savory flavors with an egg-based brunch like flair.  The service was absolutely excellent and I can't wait to be back when I'm next in town."
,,,,,"Christine, we're so glad your recent meal didn't fall short of expectations! Thank you for the incredible feedback and for coming to dine here at Little Goat - it's so validating to hear we're doing such a great job. Take care - and we can't wait to see you next time you're in town!"
,,,,,"First thing to know: make a reservation. We waited about an hour for a table without one. Which was irksome, but entirely our fault. Once we were seated, good things happened. "
,,,,,"Server was a delight. Perky but not in-your-face bubbly. After all, we weren't yet caffeinated. "
,,,,,"Latte was perfect (bold, rich, smooth), hubby's cold brew also got a happy sigh. "

,,,,,"My husband and I have been traveling for two weeks along the East Coast (Boston, Portland, Maine) with a midway stop for several days in Chicago. When we travel ... we EAT.

,,,,,"Asian-fusion brunch, owned by the same people as Girl and the Goat...you already know the food is gonna be good!"
,,,,,"We made a reservation on OpenTable and because we had two reservations for our large group, I contacted them beforehand to secure tables near each other. We still had a whole table in between us for social distancing. "
,,,,,"This Little Piggy Went To China: one of the most popular dishes to order. It's kind of small for the price you're paying but it's delicious. I wish they had a second cheddar biscuit to soak up all the leftover sauce. If you're worried about spicy, hot cheetohs are spicier. "
,,,,,Hash Browns: crispy! Loved the cheese but it didn't have much flavor. I needed ketchup to go with it. 
,,,,,Tonkatsu Sandwich: wish the tonkatsu was crispier. Seemed like there was too much sauce and it got soggy fast. It's a lot of food though! 
,,,,,"Highly recommend, and highly recommend making a reservation!"
,,,,,"This is one of the best spots for brunch in Chicago. Location, flavors, and ambience do not disappoint. We've eaten here a few times over the past few years and are always impressed. Highly recommend EVERYTHING on the menu."
,,,,,Michael - Thank you for the rave review! We truly appreciate you dining with us over the years and are thrilled that you've always enjoyed your meals. Hope to see you again soon at Little Goat!
,,,,,"Thanks a lot for making my first experience here is the best. I fall in love with all good vibes. Food is amazing! I can say ""this little piggy went to China"" is the cream of crop!!! They also have vegetarians and vegan options which my friend really love it as well :)  the staff also very nice! I need to say  ""You became the top of my fav list of restaurants in Chicago"" I will go to try Bull's eyes French toast soon!!!"
,,,,,PS. The photo booth is so much fun!!!
,,,,,"We can't thank you enough for this rave review! It's outstanding that Little Goat is one of your favorite restaurants in Chicago. We're so glad to hear you enjoyed this little piggy went to China and that we had some vegan and vegetarian options that suited your friend as well. It's always a pleasure serving someone who so genuinely appreciates our food, and we hope we'll have the chance to serve you again soon!"
,,,,,"For a Friday brunch, this place was the perfect place to eat. "
,,,,,"Called a couple days before to see if I could make a reservation for outdoor dining. Although they are accepting reservations, outdoor dining is first come first serve only. Apparently rooftop dining is not open at this time. Decided to try my luck without a reservation and hope it wasn't as crowded people said it was a couple months ago. "
,,,,,Showed up during prime brunch time around 11am and there was plenty of outdoor seating! There are 5 socially-distanced tables outside that can seat four people each and only two of the tables were in use when I arrived. Indoor dining was available as well. It began to get more crowded after noon. 
,,,,,"Service was fantastic and attentive after my order was taken. The Bloody Mary came out first (first time hearing of a Bloody Mary with kimchi). It was a delicious with the spiciness hitting at the end of each sip. This Little Piggy Went to China met my expectations; an awesome take of a Chinese inspired savory breakfast dish (the spices really stood out to me). The french toast was so soft and melt in your mouth, and the breaded chicken on top and egg in the middle was a nice twist. The most mundane item was the fries; there's nothing special or smoky about these smoked fries, but they were great fries in terms of taste and texture nonetheless. "
,,,,,Would 100% come back to try some of the other items on the menu. 
,,,,,"Bonus: restrooms are available during COVID (gender neutral, 5ish individual restrooms)."
,,,,,In town for a short minute and promised to bring my friend with her new baby some breakfast. So naturally I ordered EVERYTHING. 
,,,,,It was delivery and everything was still perfect and warm and traveled well. 
,,,,,YES PLEASE.

,,,,,"Tried the veggie burger, a bit mushy not my favorite. Great menu options for meat eaters but not so much for vegetarians or pescatarians. Would definitely return and try breakfast. "
,,,,,Great service!
,,,,,"Dina, thanks for taking the time to leave us some feedback here at Little Goat. We're sorry that the veggie burger fell short for you, but we look forward to making things up for you whenever you come back for breakfast. If there's anything we can do to improve your experience next time, please let my colleague Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, know at (312) 888-3455."
,,,,,"Amazing. Pricey for breakfast, but amazing and in 2 trips to Chicago, my favorite meal so far. "
,,,,,This was a spicy over easy egg with sausage patty and a cheddar biscuit and smoked blueberries and other stuff that added to the wonderfulness. It was hearty. It was spicy. It was delicious. Such a creative way to do breakfast. 
,,,,,Service was excellent. The restaurant itself is an upscale diner with a huge outdoor patio. 
,,,,,Don't know what else to say except this is a must stop.
,,,,,"Todd - thank you for the terrific feedback. We're overjoyed to hear your recent dining experience was one for the books, and we appreciate you taking the time to leave us a review. We'll make a note of your comments regarding pricing - in the meantime, we wish you safe travels and hope to see you again on your next trip to Chicago!"
,,,,,"I visited Little Goat Diner for the first time with a friend so that we could enjoy something more casual from an acclaimed chef. When we went on a weekday brunchtime, there were still available tables and nothing felt rushed. The server was pleasant with us, and we got ourselves a nice booth next to the window. "
,,,,,"Unlike other Goat restaurants, this one felt much more ""casual"". Of course, it's a diner! I enjoy that they served classic diner favorites with the Izard spin to them, making it a comfortable familiarity to many of us. "
,,,,,"Los Drowned -- I normally wouldn't get a sandwich at a diner, but I decided to go for this by the recommendation of the server. The sandwich was massive and I have no idea how anyone could fit it in their mouth, so I took it apart and ate it piece by piece (as assembled as I could manage). Every flavor was delicious, but I felt that it lacked the signature combinations of wacky and wonderful I've come to love about Goat. "
,,,,,"This Little Piggy Went to China -- I've always appreciated how Goat restaurants try to work in unique ingredients that bring strong kicks of flavor, and this did not disappoint. On the menu, the list of ingredients would raise some eyebrows, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well everything went together. It felt a bit on the heavier side as well, but that's diner food for you, right?"
,,,,,"At the end of our meal, we went to the photo booth near the doorway. We received two photo strips from our few minutes inside and loved that the Little Goat Diner logo was there at the bottom of each. :)"
,,,,,"Emily, thanks for visiting us here at Little Goat! We're happy to hear that you appreciated the dishes you ordered, especially the Los Drowned and This Little Piggy Went to China. We're grateful for your feedback on each. Thanks again for eating brunch here with us, and we'd love to have you back anytime!"
,,,,,"This little piggy went to China: the sauce was pretty good but the biscuit and the portion is just too small to justify the price, especially just doing takeout"
,,,,,"Gabe- I'm sorry to hear that your takeout experience was less than perfect. While we're pleased that you enjoyed the flavors of your dish, I regret that you felt let down by the portion size. This is certainly not what we hope to hear. If we can make it up to you moving forward, please let us know. Feel free to reach out to Tina Majethia, our Assistant Director of Operations, at (773) 415-0451."
,,,,,What a great experience! 
,,,,,Brunch on a Saturday morning? This is the place to go. 
,,,,,"Meal began with drinks of course, how else do you brunch? Tequila sour and an aperol spritz. Plus a delicious triple shot latte. Tasty!"
,,,,,"We started the actual meal with a cinnamon roll. It was great! Not so soft it fell apart, and delicious cream cheese frosting that actually tasted like it had cheese in it, always a nice touch. "
,,,,,"I had the Okonomoyaki, kind of a savory eastern inspired pancake. So complex in flavor and had a great mix of textures too. This was super unique and delicious. "
,,,,,"My partner had ""the little piggy went to China"" AKA the Chinese themed breakfast sandwich. This was the highlight of the whole meal. A little spice, a little sweet, and a ton of savory come together in every bite. This was incredible and will certainly be what I order when I can return."
,,,,,"On the side we had some of their delicious cheesy hash browns, they were great too. I believe they had goat cheese in them that really gave them a unique flavor."
,,,,,"We ordered some bakery goods to go, and they were gorgeous but can't comment on their taste just yet :)"
,,,,,"Our server Pablo was incredible. He gave personal recommendations, provided friendly service, and just seemed to care in a way you could really feel. Thanks for an awesome experience, Pablo and Little Goat team. I can't wait to return."
,,,,,"Hani, we're so pleased that your brunch experience was such a success! It's always wonderful when our guests have the chance to have such a wide assortment of dishes and drinks so they can have the full brunch experience. We love hearing that you know what you'll have next time you dine at Little Goat and we think the little piggy went to China is a fine choice! It's great to hear that you took home some items from our bakery and we hope they strike your fancy! We'll be sure to pass on your compliments of Pablo's service to him and he'll be so glad to hear them. We're grateful that you selected our establishment to start off your Saturday morning and we hope we'll see you again next weekend!"
,,,,,"My love and I recently dined at Little Goat Diner, Stephanie Izard's take on diner and breakfast foods. We were slightly early for our reservation (Saturday at 5:30PM) but we were seated almost right away. We did have a look at the goat-adorned photo booth during our momentary wait for our table. We appreciated our booth seating as we start to dine out a bit more as the pandemic subsides, but they also have a good amount of outdoor seating. Coming for an early dinner, the place was busy but did not seem ""packed"" so the staff was doing a good job during our visit. We finished our carafe of water, and it was replaced by a full carafe within seconds - impressive!"
,,,,,"I ordered probably the most unusual item on the menu - Okonomiyaki. This is their riff on ""Osaka street food"" - basically a pancake with pork belly, a poached egg, scallions, crunchy tempura, and the bizarre fishy-smelling bonito flakes. I'm not much of a seafood eater so the initial aroma was a bit off-putting, but overall the ensemble was a tasty concoction. My love enjoyed her All American Burger, which seemed as tall as it was wide (she wound up saving half the burger to go). We also split an order of Smoked Fries. Our server gave a detailed description of how these fries are prepared. In the end they tasted like crispy fries with a hint of seasoning, good but not spectacular."
,,,,,"Ok. Hear me out. This is the best Reuben sandwich I've had in my entire life. Scratch that, this is one of the best MEALS I've had in my entire life. When I say this sandwich is orgasmic, I mean you will have a literal out of body experiences and find out what you've been missing. I'm talking better than Manny's (I love you guys too, sorry) and even Katzs in NYC. The bread, the corned beef, and kimchi, the special sauce....... this is just flawlessly put together. I never knew a sandwich could make me feel this way."
,,,,,"Shoutout to Brooke for amazing service and the special birthday treat for me-- a sweet/salty cupcake (which, I'm pretty sure, had Annie's gourmet cheezits + glitter sugar as toppings)."
,,,,,Will 10/10 be back soon!!!
,,,,,"Anna, all we can say is wow! This review really solidifies that we're knocking it out of the park. We're so proud of our Reuben, so it gives us immense pleasure that you enjoyed every detail that we have so carefully put into the sandwich! Hearing that we've placed above some of the Reuben greats in your book is just astounding. We'll be sure to let Brooke know that her service was appreciated and we love that she went above and beyond for you on your birthday. Thank you again for sharing your experience, and we will 10/10 look forward to your return to Little Goat!"
,,,,,"This roof top restaurant had one of the best ceviches I've ever had hands down. We stopped in for an hour while we bounced around Chicago hitting multiple food spots so we only got the ceviche but it was amazing and the wine was great. Cute spot perfect for a date night/date day, girls time or even to just relax and take in a nice day. Next time I visit Chicago I'll definitely be going back to try out more on the menu (and of course getting ceviche again)"
,,,,,"Megan, thank you for the fabulous review and for making Little Goat a part of your visit to Chicago! We're thrilled to hear you loved our ceviche, and we're even happier to hear you'll be back down the road - wishing you health and happiness in the meantime!"
,,,,,best brunch I've ever had in my life.
,,,,,one of those spots where only your taste buds can truly understand how great this place is.
,,,,,"We're so grateful to hear how much you enjoyed your brunch, Johnny! Thank you for the wonderful feedback and we look forward to seeing you again. Have a great day! - Little Goat"
,,,,,Really great brunch spot with an enjoyable patio weather permitting!
,,,,,"I had the club sandwich (delicious and unique with the shredded cabbage/avocado creme) and a side of fries. The tasty smoked salt on them really sets them apart from the standard ff. Partner had Little Piggy Went to China and WOW is all I have to say about this. Explosive next level flavor! He ordered a side of the cheese hash browns that were fine cut, crispy and everything a breakfast hash brown should be!"
,,,,,"Good atmosphere, patio, menu, service andosy importantly food. Will be back for sure!"
,,,,,"Kristen, we love hearing that we really checked all the boxes for you! Our chefs are so pleased to hear that they wowed you with the This Little Piggy Went to China with its next level flavors! We couldn't agree more that our hash browns are everything breakfast hash browns should be. We hope you'll join us on the Little Goat patio again next time weather permits and we appreciate your 5 star rating!"

,,,,,"Got reservations for 1 on a Saturday. Packed, but we got seated right away! We got their famous cinnamon rolls & damn the frosting is delicious. The topping was the best part because I love cinnamon rolls that are a bit doughy. There cinnamon roll was hard to cut into & a bit dry, but that is me. "
,,,,,"For the main meal, my husband and I shared the Hot Crab Dip & Little Piggy went to China."
,,,,,Both dishes were SO good. I was very impressed with the little piggy dish. The biscuit has the perfect amount of cheddar. The sausage and sunny egg were amazing. Everything was cooked to perfection & service was fast & kind.
,,,,,Their iced chai latte was also super good with almond milk. Would love to come back!
,,,,,Hi Huyen - Thank you so much for leaving Little Goat a five-star review! We are happy to see you loved our menu. It makes our day to see that our customers enjoy everything we have to offer from the biscuits to the hot crab dip. We hope you can make it back for another wonderful dining experience. Have a wonderful day!
,,,,,"Decided to go for brunch to get out of the same ol northside neighborhood. Had been before, but not in a few years, and it did not disappoint. We started with drinks, which is always the right idea, and the nachos. The nachos with the house-made masa chips are a meal of themselves. Incredible! They need to sell those chips by the bag. You've never had chips like these!"
,,,,,"For our mains I got the okonomiyaki and my friend got the fried chicken sandwich. I felt portions were just the right size. My pancake was rich, delicious, full of big flavors and so balanced. The chicken sandwich was delicious as well. "
,,,,,"On the way out we stopped at SugarGoat bakery and took some cupcakes home, which were INCREDIBLE!! Maybe some of the best in the city. Would make the trip just for cupcakes."
,,,,,"Thank you, Sean, for writing Little Goat a five-star review! We are so glad that you enjoyed the chips and the fried chicken sandwich. Your enthusiasm makes us excited to keep bringing new flavors to our menu. We hope you come back soon for another cupcake!"
,,,,,"Been a couple times, once for brunch and again for dinner. Amazing ambiance, love the baked goods in the adjacent bakery (the pop tarts, for real--get on that). "
,,,,,"The menu is so diverse, wild, but also familiar in an unfamiliar way. You can get a burger, but it might be a foot high. You can get French toast, but it's going to have a fried egg in the middle of it and covered in bbq maple syrup. Fun!"
,,,,,One thing's for sure--don't sleep on the Choco Taco sundae.
,,,,,"Hearty diner foods with a gourmet twist! Everything we tried was incredibly unique and flavorful, looking forward to returning and trying new dishes!"
,,,,,Hi Christina - Thank you for taking the time to leave Little Goat a five-star review! Our team is delighted to hear that you enjoyed the flavors we offer. We can't wait to see you back again soon to try more of our menu!
,,,,,Sheesh - we ended up here by accident... and what a happy accident it was!
,,,,,"Little Goat Diner is in a category of its own. The service, ambience and food are going to blow your mind. The ginger medley tea was just what I needed at 8am. Our server made some fantastic recommendations and we opted for the okonomiyaki. Sheesh! We tore this dish up in a matter of minutes! It was the perfect balance of savory & sweet! It was a hearty dish and I recommend splitting it with someone. You're going to need a nap afterwards, the portions are ginormous! Also, make sure you snag an order of the hash browns... the cheese that's hidden underneath..... thank me later. "
,,,,,I'll be back to try the little piggy went to China... that scallion biscuit is calling me name!
,,,,,"Cheyenne, we are as happy as you that you ended up at Little Goat! What a lovely review! Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience and leave us your five stars. We are over the moon to hear you loved the food so much! We can't wait for you to come back and try more!"
,,,,,Wonderful brunch spot!!
,,,,,"Stopped in here on New Year's Eve to grab some brunch, and was glad I had made a reservation! The place was full and there were some people waiting as well, so I would definitely take advantage of the reservations."
,,,,,"We ordered the Little Piggy Went to China and the Bulls Eye French Toast, and both were awesome.  Super flavorful, and a great size.  Probably could have combo-ed a side with these to split, but opted not to, so missed out on some delicious looking hashbrowns, but was happy not to be too stuffed on my way out!  Great spot, would definitely come back!"
,,,,,"Nikki, thanks for coming to Little Goat for NYE brunch! We're glad that you loved both the Little Piggy Went to China as well as the Bulls Eye French Toast! We would love to have you back next time to try our hashbrowns and other tasty sides."
,,,,,"I pretty much forced this reservation on my husband as we couldn't get into Girl and the Goat for dinner. The combinations this place offers are creative and enticing. I had an extremely difficult time deciding between the okonomiyaki and this little piggy went to China, but chose piggy as I was determined my husband would love it and he went with his normal basic bro breakfast. Spoiler, it wasn't his jam totally but anything besides eggs and bacon isn't for him. As for me, I could eat ten of those biscuits! They were so light and fluffy with a little crunch on the outside and the sauce was fantastic. My latte with oat milk was so warming and comforting, like a big hug in a glass. "
,,,,,"As for ambiance, it was a gorgeous day so we chose to sit on the patio. It was lovely and inviting. Our server was stellar as well. I would 100% come here again."
,,,,,Christy - thank you for dining here at Little Goat and for taking the time to share about your experience! The way you've described your meal and the atmosphere of our restaurant makes us so happy. We'll be sure to share your kind words with our team - and we hope to have the pleasure of serving you again soon!
,,,,,"The infamous Little Goat Diner, a spin off of it's legendary parental restaurant, Girl and the Goat. Does it live up to its mighty forefather? Let's just say, Stephanie Izard...is a food WIZARD!"
,,,,,ATMOSPHERE/ARCHITECTURE: 8/10
,,,,,"Modern appearing brunch place with a casual decor and feel. I enjoy the atmosphere here. Inside seating is spacious, probably accommodating upwards of 60-70, now with newly built outdoor roofed seating which can house ~20 or so seats too."
,,,,,SERVICE: 8/10
,,,,,"Service is always good, though expect a wait at most times of the day, most days of the week unfortunately. But that means it must be worth the wait right???"
,,,,,FOOD: 9/10
,,,,,"Overall, the menu is a smattering of fusion dishes with classic brunch as a focus."
,,,,,"Los Drowned - 9/10 - Cuban style sandwich of braised beef, avocado, havarti cheese, pickled peppers n' onions, mayo, and bolillo which is rich but heavy. This is packed with excellent flavor and definitely will fill you up. I love the dipping sauce that comes with it."
,,,,,"Spiced Apple Pancakes - 8/10 - Standard buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon spice and apple overtone. This is a good dish, but nothing about it would bring me to come here over another place."
,,,,,"Okonomiyaki - 10/10 - Osaka street food with pork belly, scallions, poached egg, kewpie mayo, crunchy tempura & bonito flakes makes such a great savory crepe type dish. This dish is FANTASTIC. The crepe part is very fluffy and moist and packed with flavor. The only weakness is this dish is way TOO SMALL! I could eat 3 of these things."
,,,,,"Bullseye French Toast - 9/10 - Little Goat Diner's own twist on the chicken and waffle dish. Instead, waffles are replaced with french toast and the BBQ maple syrup sauce is to die for. The chicken is crispy and this dish is a perfect venture into fusion territory with a twist on a classic dish."
,,,,,VALUE: 7/10
,,,,,Dishes are reasonably priced. You get what you pay for I'd say.
,,,,,PROBABILITY OF RETURN: 10/10
,,,,,TO EAT OR NOT TO EAT: Definitely worth eating!
,,,,,OVERALL: 8/10
,,,,,"Kevin, this is a wonderful review to read, and we're so pleased that your experience dining with us was outstanding! Thanks for your thoughtful feedback on our dishes--we're happy that you especially loved our Okonomiyaki! It's also wonderful that you loved our atmosphere. We really look forward to inviting you back to Little Goat, and we really appreciate your business!"
,,,,,"I had planned to visit Little Goat Diner on my recent trip to Chicago because I wanted to visit at least one of Chef Stephanie Izard's restaurants while I was in town. I was bummed when on my last day I noticed that apple maps said it was closed, but decided to still head that way and at least check out the bakery next door. To my surprise the restaurant was opened (and we requested that Apple update their hours for the business). At this point my expectations are HIGH and let me tell you, Little Goat did NOT dissapoint."
,,,,,"I would recommend making reservations as it can get crowded even on weekdays. But 45 minutes went by pretty fast and we were seated inside. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous - almost as gorgeous as the food. Since we had assumed the restaurant was closed, we ate somewhere else prior to this, so we weren't really hungry. My boyfriend and I ended up splitting a meal because we HAD to try the food. We ordered the This Little Piggy Went to China and a side of hash browns (both came recommended by our waiter). The meal was as equally delicious as it was nice to look at. The scallion cheddar biscuit was out of this world and the smoked blue berries brought the entire dish up a level. Hashbrowns were cooked with cheese and were also very tasty."
,,,,,"All that to say, I'll definitely be back and next time I'll come hungry ;)"
,,,,,"Ali, we're so glad that you ventured in our direction and that we were able to accommodate you! It means so much to us that we were a must visit while you were in Chicago and that even though you'd already eaten, you found the space for a meal with us. It's great to hear that your server lead you in the right direction and that your meal was one to remember. We're thrilled that you plan to return to Little Goat and we'll look forward to serving you all your heart desires at your next visit!"
,,,,,"I was very shocked to see a diner having this many reviews and so I had to try it out when in Chicago. I was only able to get the 1:45pm time slot for lunch after making a reservation 3 ish weeks in advance, so this was a highly anticipated meal."
,,,,,- Bull's Eye French Toast - I'm usually not a big fan of french toast but this french toast was pretty good because there was so much egg in it. I also really enjoyed the chicken and the crispy breading and thought it was an interesting combination with the strawberries.
,,,,,- Los Drowned - This is one expensive but good sandwich. The pickled onions and peppers paired very well with the super tender and meaty braised beef. But I will say that the star of this dish was the bread which was perfectly crusted with a fluffy interior.
,,,,,- Hash Browns - My favorite part of hash browns in general is the cripsy edges and was glad to see that this hash brown was 50%+ crispiness. It's almost like eating chips but with cheese also incorporated in the dish.
,,,,,"Overall, good experience at Little Goat Diner. Is it mindblowing food? No, not really but it is a cool thing to try out because of the atmosphere and the way they are ""reinventing"" food."
,,,,,Hello Vivienne!
,,,,,"This review really solidifies that we're delivering a memorable dining experience for our valued guests. Thank you for taking the time to detail your journey while trying our Bull's Eye French Toast, Los Drowned, and hashbrowns. We are so pleased you could share our passion with us and hope we can serve you again next time. All of us at Little Goat appreciate your support. Take care!"
,,,,,"This place definitely lives up to the Goat brand hype in Chicago. After a failed attempt to eat at another restaurant nearby for a Saturday lunch, we decided to finally try this place and got seated right away. "
,,,,,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much initially as the fusion menu didn't excite me. But the food and experience turned out to be great. High quality ingredients and tasty."
,,,,,What we got:
,,,,,- Little pig went to China (4.5/5):  sausage egg biscuit with chili oil and blueberries. Didn't know what to expect here but wow. Explosion of flavors in your mouth. It has a tangy salty savory taste with a hint of freshness from the blueberries. Biscuit is fluffy and slightly buttery. The chili oil is not spicy but has a hint of pepper spice to it. Egg was cooked perfectly and complimented this dish so well. I didn't taste any numbing Sichuan pepper in the sausage -- it tasted more like a homemade meat sausage patty.
,,,,,"- Bull's eyes French Toast (4/5): 2 eggs, French toasts drizzled with maple syrup, strawberries and chopped fried chicken. Ordered this thanks to our waiter. Eggs are actually nested in the middle of the toasts. Bread is airy buttery with the right amount of syrup (not soaked). Fried chickens are tasty but typical. Fresh strawberries! Great if you want a sweet savory meal."
,,,,,"- Los Downed (4/5): braised beef, avocado, pickled cabbage and onions, and melted cheese. It also comes with the meat juice. The sandwich is stuffed with thick meat slabs. Good thing braised meat have slight chew to them and not too soft. Love the pickled veggies, i wish there was more they compliment the sandwich well. Meat juice is too salty for my taste."
,,,,,"Highly recommend any of these dishes, especially the first one."
,,,,,Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. Lively vibe. Food came out fast. Will definitely come back!
,,,,,"Thank you, Winnie, for your glowing review of Little Goat! Our entire team is so happy you enjoyed the food and left a happy customer. We greatly appreciate how much detail you included in your review. We hope more people feel inspired to dine with us and love it just as much as you! Thanks, again and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
