,,,,,"I ordered the smoked salmon and cucumber crumpet and holy hell was it delicious. The flavors balanced one another so well and the crumpet itself was beyond delicious - fluffy, crunchy, and chewy with a hint of a buttery flavor that works well either savory or sweet. A bit pricy for one small biscuit, at ~$5 for the one crumpet, but it was so delicious that I may have to come back to try the egg ones!"
,,,,,"Came back to try the coffee/tea and sweet crumpets, ordering the lemon and ricotta crumpet abs a drop coffee. The coffee was on the better end of drip coffees, in that I enjoyed it black without the need to dilute with any milk. The crumpet was possibly even more delicious than the last one I ordered, though this may be because I love lemon on all sweets. The coffee was limitless refills, but I went for refilling with the Darjeeling tea, which was flavorful and perfectly warm."

,,,,,A must try when in Pike's Place!  
,,,,,"I never had a crumpet but I always envisioned me having one with a cup of tea, London style.  I would compare a crumpet as being a mix between a pancake & an English Muffin.  It is fluffy like a pancake & the bottom is crunchy like the bottom of an English Muffin.  A great combination!  "
,,,,,"Egg, English Cheese, & Ham:  Very simple but very tasty!"
,,,,,Green Egg & Ham:  I did not taste a difference between the Egg & the Green Egg...
,,,,,"Butter & Honey:  A must order!  So good, I wanted more!  They put an abundant amount of honey which I loved."
,,,,,Crumpet. The hell is a crumpet. And what is up with that ridiculous line? 
,,,,,My handy yelp app shows its worthy so why not try it for my last morning in Seattle. 
,,,,,"Line moves fast and I'm running out of time on decisions. They don't have that much to choose from, but I keep going back and forth. I settle on the egg and salmon since fish is a big thing in Seattle. Oh and I can't forget about my daily caffeine, so I ordered a mocha. I'll hand it to them, with 1 barista and 2 crumpet-ers, they sure work fast! Within 5 minutes of ordering, my breakfast was set. "
,,,,,"Fresh and hot from the pan. I made sure my bite included it all. I'm not sure whether it was due to my hangover, lack of sleep or hunger, but it made me a breakfast champion. The idea was simple and I understood why people went crazy over this stuff. Often times, the glamour and the glitz gets too much and the simplest things are what is needed. Alas, The Crumpet Shop. The name says it all. Craving a bagel? Then get the hell out :)"
,,,,,"One major turn off was how the egg was prepared. I'm okay with microwaving eggs at home myself, but to PAY for eggs microwaved? Please, big no no NO! "
,,,,,"Honestly, even after devouring it in less than 4 minutes, I still didn't know what a crumpet was. Wikipedia says it's a griddle cake made from flour and yeast. I say it's a freaking English muffin? But I guess the more generalized name would be crumpet. "
,,,,,"I would love for it to be bigger so people can actually sit and chit chat, but in that location, any space would do. "
,,,,,It's a good place to get your breakfast on. Not sure if I would be willing to wait in a line for it the next time. Only if they decide to do a buy 1 get 1 free special ;)
,,,,,"Crumpets are delish and the toppings thrown on at The Crumpet Shop make them extra yummy... For those not in the know, crumpets are like a cross between a biscuit and an English muffin, and the ones served here are done so as open faced with many toppings.  We got a sampling:"
,,,,,"- egg and english cheddar: omelet with cheese baked in, pretty good but not super hot "
,,,,,"- maple butter, cream cheese & walnuts: yum combo but spread on with a heavy hand "
,,,,,"- vegemite: yeah this was weird, just tried a bite - looked like a layer of toasted cheese (it's not cheese) and was just salty"
,,,,,"Lost a star because the crumpets were not warm (which is the best way to eat them) and the couple points above about the toppings, but I would totally go back for a snack..."
,,,,,"I'm going to be dreaming about The Crumpet Shop for a long time... This tiny shop has so much flavor and fluffy texture packed in! I loved the big window allowing us see the process of making a crumpet. I was with an English friend and she absolutely loved it. Yes the queue may get intimidating and the place is far from spacious but it is definitely worth a visit, or more."
,,,,,Crumpets are good. I mean if you think of Mary poppins and the Queen at high tea then crumpets sounds boring. Not the case here. Friendly staff....delicious bites (a light snack perhaps) and a warm atmosphere. Check it out. Cheers friends!
,,,,,Best crumpets in the whole Seattle ( may be the only one serving true crumpets). Both savory and sweet are mouth watering. I am drooling while writing this review. Such wonderful memories of this place.
,,,,,"The Crumpet Shop is so highly rated and it was recommended by a few friends that have visited Seattle before so I was pretty excited to come and try a crumpet. It's located within the Pike Place area and is a pretty small shop. There's a few tables and seats in the actual store. Typically, the line goes out the door and expect to wait between 15-30 minutes on average. The menu is fairly simple and they have both sweet and savory crumpets. "
,,,,,"I tried out the organic lemon curd and ricotta cheese crumpet. It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow me at all... It's possible I tried one of the less popular items so maybe that's why I didn't care for it. "
,,,,,The main question: would I come back again? The answer is yes. I would come back again just to give it another shot and try the Maple butter since that seems to be one of the more popular choices.
,,,,,HOLY COW! Have you ever tried CRUMPETS?!! This is my first time trying it and it is TO DIE FOR! Just being in this shop and smelling the fresh aroma of bread and butter is absolutely divine! It smells like I died and went to bread heaven! Ahhhh!!!! 
,,,,,"It's basically a muffin-like bread (but better!) freshly made with holes in it. They spread a lot of butter all over it, so the butter seeps through the holes and makes it really buttery and decadent!  Then, they add whatever toppings you want on it. I ordered the egg with cheese and jalapeño (think yummy breakfast!) and ""The Vermont"" which has ricotta cheese, walnuts and maple (think dessert?!). Omg both were sooo good!! I wanted more lol. "
,,,,,"If you're ever in Seattle and close to the Pike Place Market, it's an absolute MUST! You won't regret it."
,,,,,"These Crumpets are delicious! Moist and slightly dense, without being heavy, and a crispy bottom. We got the ham with tomato and it was made fresh and served hot. Friendly service and a nice place to tuck into."

,,,,,I am sucker for pretty local coffee shops. 
,,,,,Went to this place located in Pikes place and loved it. The crumpet was delicious too! 
,,,,,Will be going again to try other crumpet flavors
,,,,,"Came here for breakfast the other morning and I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect from the menu, since I can take or leave cream cheese, but I went with the cream cheese, hm and egg crumpet and it was delicious. It was the perfect amount of food, if you just wanted a little something to eat, and my sister really liked her ricotta cheese, pesto and tomato crumpet also. Restaurant is very cute inside, and smelled wonderful (like tea). I'd definitely return and try more crumpets if I lived in Seattle."
,,,,,This little crumpet shop is SOO good! The owners are super friendly and hospitable! The crumpets are so Devine. I think I'd come back to Seattle just for the crumpets!
,,,,,"Yum... just serious yum. In a world of boring chain corporate-run 'food' - this little place is a breath of fresh crumpet-baking scented air...I wanted to try one of eat - not kidding - but settled for a savory crumpet with vegemite, English cheddar and tomato... simple, warm, Delish. And endless mug of Irish breakfast tea! Yum... just serous yum."
,,,,,"I love this place and always try to stop by if I can when I'm in Seattle. They have delicious crumpets and good coffee including free refills. I've had their crumpets with jam and the smoked salmon cream cheese before which were both good. I got one with their house lemon curd, and it was delightful. The curd was rich and lemony. The crumpet was just perfectly moist and toasty at the same time. Their lines can get long, but the food comes out pretty fast. Worth checking out some time!"
,,,,,"Delicious!! I had the honey, walnut and ricotta crumpet and it was bomb. If you don't know what's crumpet is they are fluffy soft yummier English Muffins. I really wish I had, had more time in Seattle to try a savory one but I'm glad I made it in for the one I had. Small, quaint and within walking distance from our hotel."
,,,,,this was the spot that i realized
,,,,,most of the spots within pike's place are overhyped
,,,,,i became very confused when i bit into my crumpet
,,,,,with some kind of jam and cream cheese
,,,,,there was nothing special about the crumpet
,,,,,and the texture was disappointing
,,,,,"This place was a decent spot in Pike Place Market if you were looking for a unique dessert. We ordered the Nutella and Butter Crumpet to go, and it came out nice and warm, topped with a thin layer of Nutella and a light coat of butter. It was a bit tricky to find this place, and overall I wasn't completely impressed with the dessert itself. However, the interior was nice and it was a good place to stop and relax in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Pike Place Market!"
,,,,,"The Crumpet Shop was on our list of places to eat at Pike's so we went by for breakfast. We arrived at the perfect time, there were a few patrons in front of us but the line quickly grew behind us just as it was our turn to put in an order."
,,,,,"At the shop, they offer multiple types of savory crumpets as well as sweet. We decided to go with a sweet one - the maple butter with cream cheese & walnuts. I really liked this choice because the maple butter was super sweet (a little bit too sweet for my liking), but the cream cheese & walnuts offset it by adding a little bit of a salty, neutral taste. The crumpet itself was soft and fluffy. I think it would have been very enjoyable with just a bit of butter."
,,,,,"While we didn't return here on this trip, I would recommend this shop to others. I would also be likely to return here in the future and give the savory options a try!"
,,,,,"I enjoy this place. Visiting us like reuniting with an old friend: cozy and warm. The crumpets are fluffy and chewy. I opted to have pesto eggs and ham. It hit the spot after morning work out. And in a city pretty focused on coffee, I loved the tea bar. Is I still are dairy I would certainly or for cream and lemon curd. So enjoyable!"

,,,,,A friend suggested this place as a must so I had to go while I was visiting Seattle. And I have to say i am impress. I don't really care about cheese but I have to say after having this Mac and cheese I will definitely be more open minded about it. 
,,,,,I came during the afternoon so no cheese was being made however I was able to try different samples cheese while waiting so that made up for it. I got the original Mac and cheese and it's the best I ever had. You can honestly taste quality and it's pretty rich. Glad i decided to give this place a try. My friend for the other Mac and cheese and I felt like the original was better. 
,,,,,Definitely a must try when you're visiting Seattle and make sure you go before the day ends so that you can see the workers make the cheese!
,,,,,I looooooooooooove cheese and this place makes probably the BEST cheese I have ever tasted! 
,,,,,"Located right next to the famous Pike Place market, you can see the large vats where they make the cheese fresh. If you come here, be sure to get the OG Mac & Cheese. I can probably eat this forever if carbs didn't matter. The creaminess and sharp taste of the cheddar is just perfect! "
,,,,,"Having to settle with the frozen version of the mac & cheese, the fresh version is soooo much better! But alas since I do not live anywhere near Seattle, I will have to settle with the frozen version. Come early to avoid the lines and you will be in for a treat!"
,,,,,"Best mac and cheese I've ever had. I waited about 20mins on a Saturday afternoon, and it was worth the wait. So creamy, the cheddar was sharp, and pasta was perfectly cooked. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"I didn't buy any cheese from the store but tried their famous Mac and cheese, with and without the smoked salmon. Love the original, the salmon was a little too salty for me. Def one of the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Also tried their croissant, which was at best ok - nothing to rave about. Go there early as the lines get long even before opening!"
,,,,,"What can I say about Beecher's. I want to first say I am a huge cheese lover and will practically eat any cheese. When I discovered Beecher's it was over because now I cannot compare any other place because Beecher's is the best. I have never had such good tasting cheese in my life. That flagship cheese that has been aged for 15 months is just so delicious, it literally triggers me in the most positive way. I tried the regular mac n cheese and it was life changing and a game changer. Then I ordered the grilled cheese and that perfect ooze was oh so yummy. Everyone is really sweet and if you go early say 9AM then you will not experience a line."
,,,,,"YUM. YUM. YUM. The line is worth the wait, trust me. I was here all weekend and we walked past this shop every day and the lines weren't horrible for any of the days, so I recommend you try this place out."
,,,,,"We ordered the original mac & cheese, the mariachi mac & cheese, and an original grilled cheese. All 5/5 dishes! I got a large original mac & cheese and I'm not kidding, it was probably the best mac & cheese I've ever had. It was so creamy and the pasta was cooked al dente which I loved; nothing is more annoying than mushy mac & cheese."
,,,,,"The mariachi mac & cheese was really good! It had a hint of spice and definitely some peppers. It kind of reminded me of the queso that you get at chipotle. I definitely recommend it if you want to get something a little different than the original, or do what I did and get both!"
,,,,,"The grilled cheese was really good. It was a traditional looking grilled cheese but it had a lot of flavor. My favorite part was that you could taste the richness of the butter on the outside of the bread. It was soaked in butter yet really crispy to give a salty, savory taste. I loved the bread on the grilled cheese!"
,,,,,"HANDS DOWN Beecher's mac & cheese is world's best. I tried panera's, instant, and premium 5-cheese mac & cheese in the past but this one surpasses them all. What's fun is their cheese tasters in the back and you can sprinkle some on your soup or mac & cheese bc you can never, ever have too much cheese amirite? Not only that, I went back to try their french onion soup before dinner and it was also v good. Not as full of cheese that you'd expect from a french onion soup but the croutons were the perfect texture and cheese had a different charm from that of mac & cheese. I wouldn't go back for the French onion soup but the MAC & CHEESE tho...will pop up in my dreams for quite a while, oh boy. "
,,,,,"Tip: sprinkle extra cheese and croutons & ofc, extra cheese!"
,,,,,"Fun to go and see cheesemaking from a process standpoint. Cheeses are pretty good. Expect to wait in line. I prefer their flagship cheddar, the rest are somewhat forgettable."
,,,,,Loved the grilled cheese and mac n cheese. Line was long but moved quickly for its length.
,,,,,Long lines daily when we walked by so gave it a shot. It took about 15mins in a line about 20-25 deep. We decided to only try the Classic Mac and it was very creamy.  Limited seating so we walked it back to the place we were staying. Was better that most Mac and cheese I've had but not the best of the best. If you are a huge Mac and cheese fan then prob worth the wait to judge for yourself.

,,,,,"This is my favorite coffee shop to visit when in the Pike Place market. They give airplane cookies to little children, which my kids love. They make the best caramel lattes ! They also sell other treats & tools for all your coffee needs. Definitely on our ""must visit when in town"" list. Thank you, baristas for always being so kind to my children & everyone,  everytime."
,,,,,My favorite stop on the morning before work. Best caramel lattes I've had so far. Relaxing environment inside. Best service by far!
,,,,,"Literally the most expensive cortado I've ever ordered anywhere- I ordered the same thing at tons of different local, quality places and always cost about four dollars for an oatmeal cortado and this place had the audacity to try to charge $8 dollars! WTF.  "
,,,,,"When I was like ""I think there is a mistake- a cortado is no more than $5 even with a milk sub"" they claimed it was because their emphasis was ""on quality"". "
,,,,,More like your emphasis is on pulling one over on tourists visiting Pikes Market and not having to worry about repeat business.
,,,,,"If you are in Pike Place, you have GOT to check out the coffee here - its a medium-dark roast and its REALLY good. If you are lucky, you also get free mugs. Their Provologue coffee beans are worth investing in too."
,,,,,Stopped in Seattle for some long weekend fun and needed to test out Seattle's finest coffee and it did not disappoint.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly face with freshly baked cookie samples while perusing their menu.  What a treat!
,,,,,We ended up with two 5-star Yelp worthy cortados!  Excellent super smooth coffee here paired with amazing customer service.    
,,,,,It's worth the hype. Stop by if you're close!
,,,,,"A bit difficult to find, walk inside market by crumpet shop and take elevator or turn left upstairs. "
,,,,,- THE COFFEE: Super tasty soy cortado
,,,,,"- ALT MILKS: no oat milk, but soy, coconut, cashew and almond available.  "
,,,,,"- SERVICE: very friendly service! 5 stars for sure, but SUPER slow moving line even for when they literally just opened. "
,,,,,"TLDR: If you're at pike already, I'd come, but I wouldn't necessarily trek out of your way for this one? Nearby favs available in my list :)"
,,,,,"Very cute cafe to work from. Coffee was great and had stable internet too. And if you wanna grab a quick lunch, it's a great location."
,,,,,Let me tell you a story: once upon a time I really needed some coffee. I was new to Seattle and the coffee deities pointed me to a company where coffee is looked upon as the elixir of the heavens. 
,,,,,"Yes, yes it's a fictional story based on a true story because I did have a Cafe au Lait and decadent Cinnamon Roll. You know, when you go to their website, one of the titles reads ""Bold,"" and yes, bold  is one of the ways I would describe the cafe au lait I had, not to mention rich, smooth, and full of great flavors. Yes, ""Better Beans"" do ""Make a Better Cup"" "
,,,,,as they say at Storyville.
,,,,,"I never learned if the cinnamon roll was made in house or locally baked. It sure tasted and felt like it did. It was  an over indulgence experienced and a good compliment to the coffee, since the coffee helped break through the sweetness."
,,,,,"I was very pleased with the staff members here. They were all very upbeat and friendly. I liked the way there was always at least one of them on the floor looking out for empty ware, cleaning up, and asking if patrons needed anything."
,,,,,"Storyville is conveniently located near or even at the Pike's Market, and it's a good place to go for a pick me and relax for a bit."
,,,,,Waited in line for about 15-20min but totally worth it!! The coffee was so smooth and the workers were so friendly! Pastries looked amazing too so maybe another stop before we head out!
,,,,,"My buddies and I are currently visiting Seattle, Washington, from Illinois. I love going to coffee shops and seeing how the locals enjoy themselves, so we decided to see Storyville Coffee Company. The staffs are so very welcoming, and the place is beautiful. As an Ethio-America, the taste of coffee matters to me significantly, and they did not disappoint. On top of that, they gave us cake for free! I highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,Thank you for having us. #theChicagoan.
,,,,,"Came here because a couple of friends recommended it. It was a Saturday around 12:15pm, and there were a few people ordering in front of me. One of the workers brought out with a tray of samples for us to try while waiting in line. He was very friendly and explained each pastry... the lemon cake was good!"
,,,,,My girlfriend ordered a small mocha and also got a free coffee mug for being a first timer! We paid at the cashier and the mocha promptly came out after paying.
,,,,,The inside of this coffee shop is small with a few tables and little wooden pedestal tables scattered around. Nice fireplace to look at. Good place to visit to grab a quick coffee and relax for a little bit. Might be a kind of hard to do work on a laptop here because space is so limited.

,,,,,"Ummm what is the hype about this place? Went today with friends after months of walking past and my visit was less than ideal. All of our coffee and food orders were incorrect, food server was upset when I told her we received the wrong items. Rolled her eyes and seemed annoyed- girl do that when you get home I didn't pay for a side of attitude. Drinks were bitter and croissants weren't filled which made me sad. Pizza was cold. This whole thing was just really disappointing."
,,,,,"Amazing, amazing, amazing. "
,,,,,"I am an absolute Starbucks nerd, having worked for the company for almost a decade and a half so of course I had to come while in Seattle. I went to the original location my first day and found it kind of over rated but when I came here, it did not disappoint. "
,,,,,"When I walked in the first thing to hit me was the magnitude. It's huge!! When it was first built it was the biggest Starbucks in the world and currently is in the top five largest. The entrance area is basically a shopping plaza for all the Starbucks memorabilia your heart desires, ranging from coffee machines, notebooks, and mugs to phone cases, hats and clothing. You can even get a special reserve leather apron, but it comes with a $150 price tag which made even me question my devotion."
,,,,,"To your right is the Princi bakery offering delicious looking baked goods, to the left, more normal Starbucks goodies, and downstairs, well, downstairs is where the magic is. When you walk downstairs you find the reserve bar where they offer specialty drinks you can only find at reserve stores. I got their honey bee cocktail and was blown away!!! Yes, it was almost $7, but it tasted like the perfect coffee cocktail. Made with their whiskey barrel Guatemala cold brew, topped with an orange cream foam and garnished with pink Himalayan sea salt and an orange wedge, it was one of the best things I've tasted!!!"
,,,,,"I spent an hour exploring the reserve bar and could've spent an hour more, but my companions are tragically not coffee people and were more than eager to move on. "
,,,,,"If you love coffee and all things Starbucks, go! You won't regret it!"
,,,,,"If you are visiting Seattle, this is a must-see for all coffee lovers! Do yourself a favor and skip the flagship (the first Starbucks ever) because there's always a line and it's so tiny. The reserve has over 3 different bars of specially curated coffee goodness. You can get anything from espresso martinis to affogatos to lattes in flavors they don't sell in regular Starbucks. They have pastries and pizza and sandwiches and BREAD. It's all fantastic. Don't get me started on the raspberry tart because I simply won't shut up. It's $11 and I don't care, it's worth it. It's a boujee experience and sometimes I need that after a long work week."
,,,,,I was ECSTATIC to visit the Starbucks Reserve- arguably WAY cooler than the original Starbucks down by Pike Place Market :)
,,,,,"They have many different areas within this massive building, including separate areas for warm food, bread, speciality coffees, the experience station, shopping, and not to mention the actual machines creating the coffee bags!"
,,,,,"I chose to go with the Cold Craft Flight- iced americano, cold brew, nitro cold brew, and nitro latte. It was an amazing experience to taste one after the other and see how they get progressively better and more smooth. My husband ordered a siphon coffee, which was the most phenomenal experience to watch being made. "
,,,,,"We loved it SO much here, we came back the next day for some of their yet-to-be-released lattes and pastries, and enjoyed another relaxing morning. "
,,,,,"This was one of the most enjoyable parts of our vacation to Seattle. A little expensive, but 100% worth it! :)"
,,,,,"This was such a fun place to visit I highly recommend coming here if you're from out of town...or if you're just in the neighborhood. I really like the busy ambiance and the unique varieties of coffee that they offer here. It can be a bit challenging getting a seat here, but most people seem to be happy to share tables for smaller parties. We ended up ordering their whisky barrel coffee,chocolate croissant , and a prosciutto sandwich. Everything tasted amazing, especially the coffee. The presentation for everything was also IG worthy, so definitely take some pictures if you're into that type of thing."
,,,,,"They also sell all sorts of coffee equipment ,small mugs, large mugs and everything else in between for coffee. They have a lot to offer here than the normal Starbucks, so it was a great experience for us."
,,,,,"Definitely worth a visit at least once. It's a premium experience, from the numerous friendly staff, the variety of food and the bar. The coffee wasn't too bad - had the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, which I paid a premium for. It was a bit watered down and not as complex as I was hoping. Came during an early weekend morning and there were no crowds."
,,,,,"Very cool Starbucks location with the whole shebang. It has the regular reserve bar, plus a special experience bar on the lower level, and an actual bar with alcoholic drinks! It also has a bread section, with a bunch of pizza-like flatbreads, panini options and bunch more pastries than the usual Starbucks location. And let's not forget the very cool flipboard that rotates through showing various coffee information. There are also roastery tours, a bunch of flights to try, and cool merchandise. "
,,,,,The location is huge and has an upper and lower level and you can easily spend hours here trying out a bunch of things. Food is pretty good and you could also easily have a whole meal here. Definitely a tourist spot to visit if you happen to be in the area. It was a very unique atmosphere and a highlight of my Seattle trip.
,,,,,I mean... it's just so cool. 
,,,,,"They have a bar with alcoholic beverages, a pizzeria (Princi), an experimental coffee bar and a host of delicious food/drink. There's so many fun things for coffee lovers. Expect it to be super busy on a Saturday (that's when I went). "
,,,,,"I tried a nitro cold brew - delicious. Whiskey cold brew was sweet like dessert. Pizza was delicious. Chocolate chip brioche was a little dry, but still good. "
,,,,,I've been here a few times and always leave having a ton of fun and a full belly.
,,,,,What can I say? If you're looking at this you're going to go. Great experience for tourists and anyone's first time. Not a neighborhood Cafe. A bit too crowded and very pricey.
,,,,,A complete cliche. The coffee is mediocre at best. Shout out to the staff with great knowledge and true interest. 
,,,,,If you are a tourist you will like it. Otherwise skip it and save your time.

,,,,,Love getting samples here whenever I'm at the market. Great place to bring out of towners for all the different flavors of creamy Greek yogurt.
,,,,,"I tried Ellenos Greek Yogurt for the first time during my recent trip to Seattle over Memorial weekend. My boyfriend kept ranting and raving about it, so I decided to give it a try. "
,,,,,"It is soo freaking good, I can't even describe it! I love that you can try the different flavors before ordering, but if you cannot decide what one flavor to get, do not fret... you can get multiple flavors. "
,,,,,"The gentleman who helped us informed us that they will start selling at some grocery stores, which means I will now be able to get it in LA. I'm excited about this, and I hope the quality remains."
,,,,,"Melissa, thanks for the review! Ellenos has been available in SoCal region for several months. Check the locations page on our website for the store nearest you. :-)"
,,,,,"We were able to get a taste of their Greek yogurt on a food tour.  It was very good.  I highly recommend you try it, if you get a chance."
,,,,,This is what I'll say about Ellenos. 
,,,,,You'll probably miss it the first time cause it's freaking tiny. But note that it's on a really busy corner.
,,,,,Other than that...
,,,,,"I found the concept of buying yogurt (like not frozen yogurt but literally the category of yogurt you'd get at the supermarket) rather surprising. I had heard all these rave reviews and friends tell me ""Did you get Ellenos?"" when I would mention Seattle."
,,,,,"I personally was not absolutely blown away by the yogurt, but it was pretty good. I mean, if I could eat this kind of yogurt for breakfast everyday, I'd be #blessed. "
,,,,,Note that I got the famous Marionberry (which the guy at the Info Kiosk told me to get. Thanks Bob!) and the Orange Tumeric.
,,,,,"If you're in Pike's Market, stop in for a nice treat... I had breakfast there for three days. Their Greek yogurt has a smooth taste and rich in flavor. Worth a try for breakfast or afternoon treat! Great customer service, you walk out with a smile."
,,,,,Best yogurt I've ever had! I recommend you try the Marion berry flavor as it's pretty unique and super delicious without being too sweet!
,,,,,"YEP, it is no wonder this place has 1800+ reviews with a 5 star rating."
,,,,,"Ellenos is a MUST if you are at Pikes Place Market. You can't miss it. It it right on the corner right by the icon sign. For $5 you can get a delicious cup of greek yogurt, and as a plus, you can take a super cute photo with it and the sign. The marionberry pie is amazing. "
,,,,,"Keep in mind there is no where to sit, it is a grab and go type deal but it's super easy to eat while you stroll around the market! I need to go back and try the Ube flavor (or honestly any and all the other flavors) - it looks amazing as well!!"
,,,,,Such tasty yogurt.  Key lime; pumpkin pie are a couple of my family faves. I appreciate that this is local so I'm happily supporting and exploring other flavors. Just got a couple of new ones: mango and marionberry.
,,,,,My favorite yogurt on earth right now!! Just wish they had raspberry and strawberry.
,,,,,Amazing homemade Greek yogurt. They have it set up like an ice cream shop which is fun. My husband got the raspberry ginger which had frozen raspberries in it. He said it was the best greek yogurt he has had. 
,,,,,It is on the corner across from the public market sign. I've included a picture for reference! I'd definitely recommend you check it out when you are in the area!
,,,,,Thanks for visiting us in Pike Place Market--you can find us at your local Whole Foods and Gelson's too! Please share the news with your friends and family. See you in the yogurt aisle. :-)

,,,,,My favorite yogurt.  I start every day with Ellenos and berries.  Fresh. Local. Creamy.  Goodness.  One of my favorite foods made in the PNW.  I buy my plain yogurt at Met Market which has a great selection of Ellenos.
,,,,,"I never actually had this yogurt until I saw it at Whole Foods. The time I have seen it, it was $5, and I love Greek yogurt so why not. "
,,,,,Probably the BEST yogurt I've had. So when I realize they're from Seattle and had a location...
,,,,,Of course I went there.
,,,,,"Colleen, thanks for finding us! Please tell your Bay area friends about us and we'll be looking for all of you in the yogurt aisle. Liz"
,,,,,The five stars review is not an overstatement -- ellenos is REALLY GOOD. I got the cheesecake and it was just excellent. 
,,,,,"Pro tip though, they sell ellenos as the whole foods in seattle so if you want larger sizes (for much cheaper prices) i recommend that. But they only have a limited number of flavors so you can go to the real store for the special flavors."
,,,,,"The food here is simple, but Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt hits the spot. I'm a big greek yogurt fan, so I had to check out this place while I was at Pike Place Market. They have a small stand on the corner of the iconic Public Market sign, so it's a grab and go kind of place. Free samples are available, which is a plus for people like me who enjoy trying different flavors."
,,,,,"I ended up getting the small size since there are so many other restaurants to try at Pike Place, but the portions were a perfect amount. I picked one of the flavors with strawberries (it's my favorite fruit) and it was so delicious. The yogurt was very creamy and rich in flavor, it's like a healthier alternative to ice cream!"
,,,,,"I regret not getting more, but there was just so much food to try at the market. I'll definitely be back here next time i'm in Seattle. Ellenos certainly lives up to the hype, another essential visit at Pike Place Market!"
,,,,,Thank you for finding us--and trying us! We look forward to seeing you when you come back to Seattle. Liz
,,,,,I love marionberry pie and the olive oil a sea salt. I've started paying premium prices for this in the store just to relive my experience here.
,,,,,It's like having a mango infused banana split for breakfast.   A little pricey but worth it.
,,,,,Way too much expectations built in the reviews. Nothing special. Very disappointed. Similar to normal Yogurt but expensive and sweet
,,,,,Hi Aviva!  We are so sorry to hear about this.  Please email us at 
,,,,, so we can learn more about your experience and make it up to you!
,,,,,"Most creamy and yumm yogurt, not too sweet. Liked the berry and passions fruit flavors. Ask for a 50-50 mix. Tastes even better with toppings. Must visit if you are visiting Seattle. Loved it"
,,,,,The best yogurt in the world. Gotta try it if you haven't. 
,,,,,"They make different flavors than any other brand. Smoother, yummier, and just damn better."
,,,,,My favorite place at Pike Place Market! 
,,,,,The Greek yogurt is just different here it's almost like ice cream. Not too sweet or tart just perfect with great flavors. 
,,,,,This time we got pumpkin pie and the marionberry in the walkaround sizes for $5 each. The pumpkin pie was a little icy but still smooth. The marionberry is absolutely perfect. I felt like I was eating a creamy fruit pie with the pie crust in every bite. 
,,,,,Wish I could get this stuff where I'm from so definitely get it while you're still in town.
,,,,,"Hi Ryan,"
,,,,,Thanks for visiting us at the Market--and for your review! Hope you'll be back to visit soon. :-)

,,,,,If you're an art enthusiast or just someone who can appreciate another's imagination and creativity - then purchase a city pass and make your way to the Chihuly Garden & Glass exhibit. 
,,,,,"The colors, the artistry, the skill! "
,,,,,I could wander this place for hours and still walk out wishing I had taken hundreds or more photos! 
,,,,,This is a beautiful place to stroll and there's even a cafe to feed the stomach when your mind runs tired from contemplating the amount of talent that it had taken to create all the work presented here. 
,,,,,Worth an afternoon if you're in town!
,,,,,Breathtaking. Amazing. Beautiful. Creative. These are few words that describes how wonderful this museum is! I bought this ticket with the space needle ticket and so glad I did. The photos online doesn't even compare to experiencing this in real life. My favorite is the sea life section. Every little detail and how the lights hits the glass is truly picture perfect! I recommend anyone who visits Seattle to check out this place!
,,,,,I feel confused. 
,,,,,So going to the De Young Museum in SF with my family is a delight that makes the annual membership a sound investment.
,,,,,The SFMOMA is a waste on me. 
,,,,,This was a waste on me.
,,,,,I was a tourist and visited an attraction. 
,,,,,I had an idea what I was getting into when I looked at the Yelp page. 
,,,,,What happened in real life? 
,,,,,"Staff everywhere - but no one was friendly or helpful. They just kept shouting  ""Don't touch"" (I wasn't touching - other people were) "
,,,,,People with long camera lenses taking photos forever made viewing the pieces extraordinarily challenging. 
,,,,,I took what photos I could and left. 
,,,,,I paid $58 for 5 Mins in that building and outside. 
,,,,,I don't know what I paid for. 
,,,,,It wasn't my cup of tea. I would not recommend.
,,,,,"YES, you need to go here!"
,,,,,This is some beautiful artwork.
,,,,,"You can easily spend over an hour admiring the beauty, or if you are tight on"
,,,,," time, you can walk through the whole thing in 30 mins.... but you should really take the time to check it all out. There are videos and demonstrations too."
,,,,,One of my favorite attractions in Seattle!  
,,,,,"Peaceful, relaxing and spectacular glass art museum!  Never seen anything like it!  Easy to navigate, mostly indoors with a small portion outside.  They also offer complimentary photos throughout the museum which was a nice added perk!  "
,,,,,"Took us about an hour to complete (at a moderate pace- with no kids) We utilizes the city pass, which made it a little more reasonable.  "
,,,,,"Definitely worth going to, in my opinion!"
,,,,,Chihuly's glass art pieces are just beautiful. I would say it is a monument to glass as Art.
,,,,,"Must see when in Seattle. The glass, all of it, is such a piece of art! Breathe-taking! There was a wedding going on when I went and the venue looked absolutely beautiful with the glass surrounding the area where the bride and groom would say their vows."
,,,,,"The exquisiteness of the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit brings pure delight to one's eyes with absolute inspiration and possibilities. The beauty of the artwork can't merely be illustrated into words. Artwork in the exhibit capture spectral properties that exhibit warmth and characterization, with every piece conveying a different meaning and emotion. "
,,,,,"The Chihuly exhibit is a masterpiece! As I was in awe by the grandeur and intricacies of the glass pieces, one can only wonder where the inspiration came from. As the exhibit holds numerous glass pieces by the renowned Chihuly, it captures the attention of people of all ages. Lines, colors and textures in the artwork are all captured beautifully through glass representation. "
,,,,,"The garden and indoor display areas bring a warm, welcoming and inviting ambiance. The Chihuly exhibit will forever be an unforgettable experience and a must see destination that I would revisit and highly recommend to friends, family, and the Yelp community!"
,,,,,I loved this museum! Each room has a different theme. And there are sculptures inside and outside. They also have demonstrations. This is a must see!
,,,,,"If someone asked me what my ""must do"" things in Seattle, Chihuly Garden and Glass would be very high on my list!  I went to Chihuly because it was part of our City Pass and not necessarily because I was very interested.  From the moment I walked through the doors, I was in awe.  The glass sculptures were phenomenal.  The environments they were placed in were stunning!  I took a million pictures and loved every moment of the visit.  Be sure not to rush through the museum and DO NOT skip the gardens outside.  I recommend everyone visit Chihuly Garden and Glass every time they visit Seattle!"
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"""THAT'S Made Of Glass?!?""  *Shock & Awe*"
,,,,,The Chihuly Garden and Glass Does Not Disappoint!
,,,,,SITREP
,,,,,"Top of my ""To-Do"" with the Mom-ster was FINALLY getting us to go see the wondrous arrangements of the Chihuly Garden and Glass Exhibition at the foot of the Seattle Space Needed.  Given that she wasn't feeling well this day, she STILL wanted to go and was quite the trooper, as her fierce face can attest too!  ;)"
,,,,,THE SETUP
,,,,,"Well, why not start at the Seattle Space Needle too?  I pulled the *trigger* on the package deal for a combo pack of the Space Needed and the Chihuly Garden & Glass.  "
,,,,,So after we spent our time hitting the observation deck and also enjoying the glass floor on the lower deck - that looks straight down to the ground! - we ambled on over to the structure that houses the Glass Garden.
,,,,,SO MUCH REFLECTED REFRACTED BEAUTY!
,,,,,There are some key elements that make glass sculpture so special:
,,,,,"* It goes without saying the shape of the glass, and the composition of the glass blends, brings a lot to the strength of the glass - how much weight can a shaft of glass withstand in holding up a large blossom of light sculpture?"
,,,,,"  How do you ensure it doesn't break, while at the same time maintain the illusion that only the slimmest of strands are holding up the largest of balls;"
,,,,,"* Additionally, for me, the interplay of ""light-upon-glass"" is the core of what makes looking at glass sculpture so mesmerizing, and it's obvious that creator Dale Chihuly has captured this down to a science, NOT just an art.  [I think of this gentleman as a ""Mad Wonderful Space Pirate, Sailing His Glass Ships on a Sea of Glass!"""
,,,,,"* The colors used, the positioning of the light source, the intensity of the lights, the intersection where the light meets a glass surface, the colors of the lights, the colors of the glass, etc. etc., each add their own element that weaves in the end the ""light symphony"" that you take into your optic nerves."
,,,,,THE ROOMS
,,,,,Each of the rooms of the Glass Garden were in this own way breathtaking and dynamic!
,,,,,"* The Sealife Room, revealing such intricate detail in the SMALLEST of glass works with the sea creatures (in this instance below, sea turtles)"
,,,,,"* The Persian Ceiling Room, reminiscent of another of his works at the Ballagio in Vegas!"
,,,,,* The Milli Fiori Room - it took me a full minute to circumnavigate around the entirety of this one glass sculpture - absolutely amazing!
,,,,,"* The Ikebana and Float Boat Room, a visual delight of chaotic combinations in the float boat."
,,,,,* The Macchia Forest - a colorful real life example of what I imagine the forest on Pandora must be like in the movie Avatar.
,,,,,"* And what I like to think of as the Gothic Garden - ""Dark Crystals everywhere in the majestic outdoors, soaking up the sun, OR the rain."
,,,,,"Every place told a different story, and each made me feel like I was being transported to a different place."
,,,,,THE LOWDOWN
,,,,,I thank Dale Chihuly and the Seattle Business Associations that brought this superb exhibit together.  It's one I will cherish.
,,,,,Visually stunning. Gorgeous. Mesmerizing. Inspired.  
,,,,,"The gardens were clean, the artwork was beautiful, the staff was dedicated to preserving the rules, and the live music was a bonus.  "
,,,,,"*I* think it's pricey on its own but with a touristy city pass/combo ticket, it's worth it.  (If we hadn't bought a combo ticket, I'm not sure I would've gone.) I echo others who weren't keen on visiting but came away so glad they did."
,,,,,"When you're in Seattle, you definitely have to check out the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit. Everything is exquisite. Admission price can be steep, so I highly recommend getting the Seattle City Pass (only if you plan to go to pretty much everything that the pass offers to get BANG for your buck)."
,,,,,"They have time slots, so make sure you head over to the booth to redeem your city pass ticket for your desired time slot. We actually came here before we checked into our hotel, so one great thing is that they offer free luggage storage."
,,,,,"The exhibit is really beautiful. Make sure you don't touch anything! All the artwork is viewed in an indoor and outdoor setting. I would say we probably spent a little over an hour here, so definitely take your time to be present with the gorgeous glass art. A tip - selfie sticks are not allowed."
,,,,,We got there right around the time they opened so we had it pretty much had the place to ourselves. So beautiful!! Definitely worth it. There was about two rooms that had a photographer that takes pictures of you or your group and you can download them for free.
,,,,,"It's worth checking it out at least once, there is a lot of glass art to enjoy from our local artist!"
,,,,,"We had our company's holiday party at the location, I have to say that the setup is not suitable for such a large party. The live band, buffet and bar were all in the same room which ended up super crowded with really long lines to get food and drinks."
,,,,,Other thoughts:
,,,,,Pleasantly surprised that no glass art was damaged during the party.
,,,,,I finally got to see my favorite artists unique artwork at this museum during a business trip my husband & I recently went on. He offered to take me on this trip since he knew that I really wanted to see this museum. 
,,,,,I always wanted to go to Seattle too. The artwork inside is stunning. So is the art displays in the garden. It's located by the space needle & the museum of pop art.
,,,,,There's a cute cafe inside with outdoor & indoor seating. They have cool artwork on the walls $ each table had different antique items inside the glass table.
,,,,,The food there looked good but we only had drinks there. The cocktail I got was something made with passion fruit. It was small & just ok.
,,,,,Even my husband was impressed by the artwork there. He didn't think he'd like it that much as he considers tractors & planes to be much more interesting.
,,,,,"He once told me to come check out something amazing at the Vatican once. I thought it must be something really impressive as he got really excited. It turned out to be a crane! He said that's real art! I laughed so hard then that a preist had to sush me, lol!!!"
,,,,,So even people who aren't crazy about art might actually be impressed at how amazing the art there is!
,,,,,"For a fun excursion, check this place out. Beautiful glass blown that will take your breath away. Right under the space needle and close to the Gates Foundation museum. Highly recommend for a day trip."
,,,,,"OVERALL get the CityPASS (this let's you see multiple Seattle attractions in a package deal, Google it), and check this place out. Super cool glass art work. Cooler in person than the photos show justice. You get one free photo...photographers are wandering around. Kiosk in the middle and at the end of the walk through where you type in your email address for the photo to be sent to you. "
,,,,,Part of the walk is outdoors which is nice. I highly recommend. Especially check this out if you're waiting for your windowed time for the Space Needle. Can be in and out of here in 45 minutes average. 
,,,,,TO GET HERE take the subway or monorail. Google map it and it'll tell you how to get here without needing to take an Uber.
,,,,,Provender: great museum adjacent to the Space Needle. Dale Chihuly is an amazing sculptor. If you've been to the Bellagio in Vegas you've definitely seen his art work.
,,,,,Prices: admission for an adult is about $30.
,,,,,"Parking: they have a valet service that charges an arm and a leg, or you can park at one of the nearby lots for around $10. I parked at the lot on John St. and Warren Ave. N."
,,,,,"People: fun for all, but adults would probably enjoy it more here."
,,,,,"Perks: the glass works are amazing. They also have various hourly-ish activities, so you'll have to check the schedule. They have various exhibits, with the one in the glasshouse being the largest. You can also stroll outside for the garden, which holds more works."
,,,,,Highly recommended! This is a beautiful exhibit! 
,,,,,Chihuly is one of my favorite artists so flying up to Seattle to see this exhibit was a 'no brainer'- a la The Bieber himself. 
,,,,,I went to 
,,,,," and followed along with the tour and it added to the experience. There is the main exhibit, the garden and then finally the glass house. All of it was amazing!  Photos don't do it justice. "
,,,,,Tickets are $30 for an adult but worth it.

,,,,,I am not the biggest fan of museums but this one was quite pretty. The artwork speaks for itself and it's a great place to photos of the art and selfies too. 
,,,,,I took advantage of CityPass and would recommend the same if you plan to stay at least 2 days. 
,,,,,"You have a hour timeframe to enter the exhibit. You could probably see the whole thing in 30 minutes. If you plan on sticking around for the glass blowing demonstration, you may end up staying longer. "
,,,,,"There is an indoor exhibit, ""greenhouse"" exhibit and the garden so make sure to view all 3 before you leave."
,,,,,I originally learned abt him cause of his design in the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.
,,,,,We bought a combo pack that includes the needle and glass museum.  Imo it's pricey but I guess it's also to sustain the cost of the buildings being there.
,,,,,Definitely a pretty place for pictures.  And I suggest listening to the people wking there To tell u abt the place so u can catch something you didn't know.
,,,,,It's not as many pieces or rooms or big as I I thought it would be but it's nice.  A place to check out at least once.
,,,,,A Seattle staple. 
,,,,,"We already expected to love going up the Needle, but Chihuly Garden was a pleasant surprise (located right beneath the needle)."
,,,,,"We had an hour to kill before our Space Needle time slot, so snagged the needle tickets that included entry to this museum. "
,,,,,"It only takes about 30 minutes to go through and is visually fascinating. I've seen lots of blown glass art before, but never like this. The pieces are placed in the most artistic way: paired with incredible lighting and dark backgrounds to make the glass appear to be glowing. "
,,,,,"This was my type of museum: highly visual without a ton to read, and utmost freedom. There was even an outdoor section with interesting blown glass spikes sticking out of the ground. It really SPIKED my interest for this type of art and I'd recommend this spot for anyone!"
,,,,,"So, so pretty!"
,,,,,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from Chihuly Garden and Glass, except for a bunch of glass sculptures, but I never imagined the beauty of some of the pieces.  The skill level and talent of the artwork is impressive.  The exhibits are bright and colorful.  My only wish would be to have a description of what each piece is, the name of the piece, and/or the inspiration.  "
,,,,,"While Chihuly Garden and Glass is a great place for adults, not sure kids would appreciate the beauty of the sculptures, especially since you aren't allowed to touch anything."
,,,,,"Really cool museum but pretty busy on Memorial Day weekend. The live glass demonstration is really cool, and you get a free professional photo with your ticket which you can download off the internet later."
,,,,,The museum is very colorful and gorgeous. My company had their company party here. The interior had glass pieces and around the garden it had various kinds of plants. It's a nice place for a quick date since it has about 3-4 rooms of artwork.
,,,,,There is parking near the Garden and it is next to the Space Needle and the fountain.
,,,,,A personal favorite spot of mine. I love the layout of the exhibits and how vibrant the main exhibit area is even on a cloudy or rainy day. I am always amazed at how beautiful the colors are. I love how much space is in the exhibit to really allow you your own space to go through the exhibits without being distracted by other patrons. I especially appreciate how much room is in the main exhibit. They have both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Leading you to see glass artwork at every step of your visit in the exhibit. I've come here for multiple yoga classes and love the atmosphere and the layout of these classes. I find these to be some of my favorites. They have also offered salsa dance classes here which was an amazing date night. Make sure to check out their monthly calendar as they offer a lot of unique events outside of just visiting the exhibit. I highly recommend you make a trip to the chihuly museum!
,,,,,"Truly a beautiful space for the SO and I to take in ""da arts"". We visited Chihuly Garden and Glass as part of our City Pass tickets. "
,,,,,"Located right next door to the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden displays a ton of gorgeous blown glass shaped in ways I couldn't believe. There are about seven rooms each with different works/styles done by Dale Chihuly. There is also an outdoor area where people do live demos, and a garden area with more beautiful works. My favorite part was the sea creature exhibit with the huge blue and white centerpiece that towers up the ceiling."
,,,,,Definitely worth a visit as pictures just don't do it justice.
,,,,,It's a great place to visit during the pandemic period! It gives you a awe while you see all the beautiful art works!
,,,,,"I'm a huge fan of Chihuly, so I loved the exhibits and reading about his work but the admission is kind of expensive and the gallery is smaller than expected. There's also glass blowing demos!"

,,,,,"The Pink Door always felt like home to me  Great entertainment, great staff, delicious products"
,,,,,"I really wanted to love this place, but I left feeling underwhelm. Maybe I set my expectations to high with all the rave reviews? Here is my breakdown:"
,,,,,PROS: 
,,,,,- Neat environment and atmosphere
,,,,,- Friendly service
,,,,,CONS:
,,,,,"- The food was very average, nothing that my socks off. We had the cioppino, lasgna, and meatballs. There was nothing wrong with the food, but it was just tasted average."
,,,,,"- It is very hard to get reservations here and if you show up, plan to wait in line. "
,,,,,"With all the food options in Seattle and in this area, I'm not sure if it's worth the wait. It felt like a tourist trap. However, if you like to check it out, look for the pink door. There is no sign for the restaurant."
,,,,,"The Pink Door deserves all the Yelp adoration it receives. The servers go out of their way to ensure that you have a great time and make excellent recommendations. Either that, or everything on their menu is fantastic, which is also fine."
,,,,,"If you can secure a spot in their back room, the experience becomes even better. However, you don't need to sit there to have a great time. I highly recommend their Ragu pappardelle or the extremely flavorful meatballs!"
,,,,,The Pink Door is one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle! I've been here about 4 or 5 times already and have tried pretty much all of the pasta options though they have great seasonal and special menu options (as well as season cocktails!). I just love the entire vibe of the place and how they have shows with dinner in such an intimate setting.
,,,,,The linguine with clams comes with TONS of clams and is delicious! It has strong white wine flavor and is great for people that don't like pastas with a ton of sauce.
,,,,,The lasagna is also amazing - very traditional and great when you're craving something very hearty.
,,,,,They also have really good bread at the beginning / though I wish it came with balsamic vinegar in addition to the olive oil.
,,,,,Regardless I highly recommend stopping in here for a special dining experience! Leave your name and phone number early so that they will text you when a table is free.
,,,,,"Say no more. Lunch at @thepinkdoorrestaurant was incredible to say the least. There are a few things on the menu that have ""Pink Door"" in their name and for good reason. Get. These. That Caesar Salad and Lasagna HIT different. That was hands down the best lasagna I've ever eaten before. And you know I be EATING. Get the Dungeness crab on top of that fresh Caesar Salad and you'll enter the gates of heaven. There is nothing bad here. Enter cautiously because you may leave with an addiction."
,,,,,1. Pink Door Caesar with fennel dusted croutons and fresh northwest Dungeness crab 
,,,,,"2. Lasagna Pink Dior: fresh spinach pasta layered with besciamella, pesto and topped with marinara sauce "
,,,,,"3. Linguini Alle Vongole: baby clams in their shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis and white wine "
,,,,,"4. Sticky Pumpkin Toffee Cake: bourbon, salted caramel hazelnut gelato "
,,,,,Tongue? Blessed.
,,,,,"This place is amazing. So good, that our family ate there twice within a 10 day stay in Seattle. Don't have a reservation?  Don't worry.  Just make sure to get over to the pink door by 4:30pm and get in the ""first come, first serve"" line to be seated.  They usually are able to accommodate a lot of parties from this line.  The atmosphere of the Pink Door is so laid back and comfortable.  If you're in downtown Seattle and looking for a place for dinner, this is the place."
,,,,,This was a great place for dinner when we visited Seattle.  I highly recommend the ink squid pasta.
,,,,,Pasta (LINGUINE ALLE VONGOLE) was little too salty so asked to remake it but it was still salty.  Overall experience  good and friendly server.
,,,,,Delicious food and great service. They are taking Covid-19 safety very serious. Hope to be back under better circumstances!
,,,,,"Not bad, but not sure if it's worth the hype. When we walked up, we were told it's an hour long wait and we were ok, just needed to show vaccine proof. Once we did, they brought us in and had a 5 min wait. Not sure why they said 1-1.5 hours at the start. Ambience was great, cute little spot with a great band playing. Our waitress was kind, but could be friendlier. Food was ok as well, had the clam linguini, risotto, and fish of the day. they did have a big amount of clams in the linguini  but I've had much better elsewhere. Dessert was also so-so...wish they had chocolate options-had the basil cake and wasn't for me. Overall it was ok, but wouldn't come back. I wish the staff were a little friendlier, and the food IMO wasn't worth the price (I'm ok paying higher prices for good food but this wasn't it)."

,,,,,"Delicious pastries!!! Heavily suggest trying out the Smoked Salmon Pâté! Absolutely delicious, unique, and savory! In our time in Seattle, we had them more than 50% of the mornings we were there. They're sold at a reasonable price. The sweet Apple Pastry (don't remember the actual name), but it was delicious as well. It contained fresh apples and was one of the best apple pastry I've had.  Absolutely recommend! Lines get long, so be prepared!"
,,,,,The crowd control lady lies! They might as well call this location Pinocchio Pinocchio 
,,,,,"She kept telling people 7-10min wait to get piroshkis, but 20min later we had moved less than 10 feet! A local told us sometimes the wait is 1.5 hours!!"
,,,,,We left and went to another location (5min walk away) with no wait!
,,,,,"Hello Mary,"
,,,,,"We're really sorry to hear about your experience. Our team tries their best to give accurate estimates for the wait and try to help as many people as possible as fast as they can. We understand that the wait can take a while during our busy season, but we are happy to hear you found our other location at Century Square as an alternative. We do apologize for the wait and hope you had a great visit in Seattle."

,,,,,"they came to my apartment complex & this is my first time ever trying them out, i got the beef & cheese & WOW... it had just came out of the oven. soooo delicious i got another for my hubby because i was that good. def. would drive to seattle to get more. would recommend to anyone ! & pricing is fair :)"
,,,,,"My partner showed me this place and I was surprised at how good a simple looking pie could be! I got the curry pie and always devour them fast :) not too salty, not too intense but really harmonious flavors. I think they are vegetarian-friendly as well."
,,,,,"Line was long on Labor Day but moves fast, no more than ten minutes until we were inside!"
,,,,,"They take credit card, yay!"
,,,,,"Got the cinnamon and cardamom, apple cinnamon, potato and cheese, and beef and cheese. I'm definitely a savory lover so potato and cheese was my favorite. They potato inside is grated and the bread is so soft and it's just so delicious that wish I had purchased six of them and eaten them all!"
,,,,,My boyfriend's favorite was the apple cinnamon and I'd have to agree that it's phenomenal; it's just so gooey and soft and sweet but not too sweet! 
,,,,,"I'd recommend that as a first timer, to get the most popular ones: cinnamon cardamom, apple cinnamon, potatoes and cheese, beef and cheese, and then to experiment with the other ones after you've tried the OGs- they're OG for a reason!"
,,,,,"Next time I go back I'm trying the salmon one and eating six, heck EIGHT potato and cheese!"
,,,,,What more can I say for a place which has such a huge fan following and long lines at all times..
,,,,,I stopped by one morning right when they opened and it was not very busy. They were prepping fresh piroshky and the place smelled heavenly..
,,,,,We had potato cheese piroshky and I would rate it 4 stars.
,,,,,Cheese Garlic piroshky was 5 stars. They were hot and so fresh..Service was quick and friendly.
,,,,,I'm rating this place purely for their beef and onion Do not get the apple cinnamon. Get like 2 beef and onion. I would come back everyday just for the beef and onion. So good. 
,,,,,The beef and onion was packed full with beef. The apple cinnamon seemed off. Maybe they didn't use sweet enough apples or maybe it was cold but it wasn't good.
,,,,,"Hello Anita,"
,,,,,"Thanks for the review. We're happy to hear you loved the Beef & Onion Piroshky. Thanks for the information on the Apple Cinnamon Roll, we don't often hear negative information about it. We would love to try to make this right with you, feel free to DM us or email our customer service at "

,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,TLDR: MUST TRY spot located near the first Starbucks and the Pike Place Market. You won't regret!
,,,,,"I first stumbled upon this unassuming bakery two years ago on my first visit to Seattle, and was immediately in love. Every time I'm in town, I find myself craving Piroshky Piroshky."
,,,,,"Piroshky are ""baked or fried yeast-leavened boat-shaped buns with a variety of fillings."" They are amazing comfort foods for the frequent gloomy, rainy days in Seattle. There's both savory and sweet version of the fillings at this bakery, and they get you in and out really quickly."
,,,,,"The pastry is amazingly crispy and slightly flaky, but heavy enough that you can feel like you're actually biting into something amazing. The various fillings that they offer give you an ability to almost have a full meal. The line is crazy long almost all the time, but I was lucky enough to come here on a Tuesday morning around 9AM to just a small line of 3 people."
,,,,,Omg!! I had never had a piroshky but this place had a long line so it caught my attention.  It was amazing! I ordered two random ones and I couldn't decide which one was better.  This is definitely something I recommend!
,,,,,"Small bakery serving piroshky (Russian-style puff pastry) right across from Pike Place Market. The place had a line, and seemed to be a popular local spot, so decided to give it a try. Despite the small footprint, they have a pretty good variety of items, both sweet and savory, available for sale. The prisoshky are pretty good sized, and at $5-6 each they are not pricey nor particularly inexpensive. "
,,,,,"I got one with cinnamon and pumpkin spice cream (probably the fall seasonal item), and one that was white chocolate with cherry filling. The pumpkin spice one was pretty decent. The pumpkin cream on top was the highlight: it was very smooth, creamy, and just sweet enough with the right hint of pumpkin spice. As for the cherry piroshky, the filling was a bit too... tart for my tastes. Was expecting something a bit sweeter. I didn't like that one very much. "
,,,,,"Overall, my first experience with Piroshky Piroshky was a mixed bag. Might go back some later time to try some other varieties."

,,,,,Takes both cash and credit card.
,,,,,Be sure to come early and wait in line. We got in line on a Sunday in between lunch and dinner time. This is the best time to get in line as line took about 10 minutes at most. Be sure to know what to order as the folks behind the server table will eagerly pick out the pastries that you like to order. 
,,,,,Sitting indoors is very limited. Approximately 2-4 seats. Most people just grab and go.
,,,,,"I highly recommend their jalapeno sausage roll. Its a limited seasonal item. We also ordered their salmon pate pastry which was good, but a bit fishy smell. The staff here are VERY friendly and willing to help answer any of your questions. "
,,,,,"If you are in the area, must try out this spot. The food is delicious."
,,,,,"My friend told me about this place so I had to check it out, and try it for myself. I tried the Beef&Cheese and Salmon since everyone said it was good. And it was! So glad I stood in line. I know the line looks a bit intimidating, but it goes by real fast. "
,,,,,"The reason why I gave this place a 4 star is because one of the workers that helped me wasn't friendly at all. You can tell this person was faking their smile. Once I got to the register, I paid in cash and after giving the worker my bill I said, ""I have coins,"" so she wouldn't have to give me more coins as change. Guess she didn't hear me and gave me my change with the coins. I said, ""I had the coins,"" and she just said, ""Sorry too late I already put it in."" But I had the exact coin change so all she had to do was take it, and give me a dollar... I guess she was just in a hurry since it was so busy, but I don't like feeling rushed."
,,,,,Visited on a weekday morning and there was no line!!  There were lots of sweet and savory options to choose from...  I tried the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky and the Beef and Cheese Piroshky.  The Smoked Salmon Pate was yummy while the Beef and Cheese was just OK.  The Smoked Salmon Pate was also cuter because it was shaped like a fish! :)
,,,,,"Lonnnnng line but maybe only a 20 minute wait. Gave me a chance to chat with the young lady behind us who just moved to Seattle and was , in her words, ""still acting like a tourist."" "
,,,,,"Anyhow, straightforward menu options but was hard to choose. Good thing everyone in my group ordered something different so I tried several items. "
,,,,,I'm usually a savory gal but hands down my favorite was the marzipan piroshky. It had the perfect filling-to-crust ratio. The dough was so soft and tender! Yum.
,,,,,Beef/onion and jalapeño/cheese were both quite tasty and enjoyable. (Potato/cheese or the mushroom/celery/onion piroshky were my least favorite but still liked by others.)
,,,,,Glad we tried this winner of a place!
,,,,,"Lived up to the hype. Got the beef and cheese piroshky. Line moved fast, the piroshky was hot, savory and everything I hoped it would be. Will come back someday to try other flavors!"
,,,,,"I went here three times during my four days in Seattle and no matter what time of the day you go, the line goes all the way down the block! It IS located right next to the first Starbucks, so make sure you get in the right line. It's not too terribly long in the morning if time is a huge factor for you. Otherwise, even with the long lines, the wait never feels too bad. "
,,,,,"Everything I've ordered here is absolutely delicious! The piroshkies are a little oily, but in just the right way for a girl on vacation. The staff are super nice and the prices are a STEAL. If you're visiting Pike's Place, you HAVE to stop by here for a snack."
,,,,,"Eh, not sure what the hype is all about. I tried the salmon pate and the apple cinnamon roll. Both are two of the most popular items. The dough is flavorful but the fillings left me wanting.  It's an experience, but The line is ridiculous so be prepared to wait."
,,,,,"This spot has been producing quality food for so many years. You absolutely need to visit them and give them your business. If you are visiting Pike Place Market, please grab a potato and mushroom!  I will just say ""You're Welcome"" now."
,,,,,"When people think of Seattle, they may think of the rain or coffee, but for me, I think of Piroshky Piroshky. Their pastries are freaking amazing. Whether you're eating it right after you buy it or reheating after buying a bunch to take home, it still tastes the same to me. Personally, the smoke salmon pate is definitely my favorite. I have tried a bunch of other random pastries, but I don't remember their names. I would pick whichever one looked good through the glass window shelf. I just remember all of them to be all kinds of deliciousness. A disclaimer though, the pastries here are not cheap. For example, one salmon pate will set you back about $5. "
,,,,,"This location is the most popular one because it's located smack in the middle of Pike Place Market and naturally the more busier one. But if you go during the midway during a work week, it isn't usually as busy as say the weekend. But if you don't feel like waiting in line and want to walk a bit, there is one not too far off from Pike Place on 4th and Pike St."
,,,,,"Delicious! On the savory side we tried the salmon and the egg, bacon, cheese piroshkys which were both amazing. Also loved the chocolate hazelnut. Garlic cheddar was just okay."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Line out the door but moves very fast, so don't be discouraged as you won't be waiting long. we ordered the salmon pate, bacon hashbrown, beef and cheese, jalapeño sausage, and apple cinnamon. Everything was fresh and yummy. No seating. We had our toddler in our all city gb pockit stroller and was able to maneuver the narrow entrance. Accepts cash  and card. Friendly service."
,,,,,"Oh how I wish we had a Piroshky Piroshky in Hawaii -SOB- this had to be my favorite thing I ate in Pike's Market. We got there pretty early so we were lucky enough to beat the line. You could smell them baking their pastries from a mile away; it's so mesmerizing! And I had a really hard time choosing what I wanted but I knew I had to get my hands on the Smoked Salmon Pate. The environment is really fast paced so make sure you know your order once you enter in the shop. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. Once we got our goodies and pictures, I went for that first bite and WOW, it was amazing! I don't know how they did it but the flavors were so addicting that I immediately wanted to order a second one. I had a bite out of my friend's pastry which was a Hash brown/Egg/Meat/Cheese all cooked and stuffed together in the bread and it was amazing! That can definitely fill someone's stomach up for the morning. I definitely wish I had more time to eat the rest of their selections. Until next time!"
,,,,,"I had Piroshky Piroshky on my bookmark list for a long time. Truth be told, I was planning on Pike Place Chowder, but I didn't want to waste an hour of my vacation waiting. The small bakery is located across the street from the Pike Place Market near the original Starbucks. Parking is a mythical object here so walk like an Egyptian. "
,,,,,The menu is extensive with a split between sweet and savory pastries. The savory side is a bit more authentic with meat and cheese stuffed in bread. The sweet side is more popular with lots of fruit and cream options. The line wraps into the street with staff handing out menus. 
,,,,,"I chose the smoked salmon and apple cinnamon roll. The salmon was cute shaped like a fish, but it had very little filling although the flavor was there. The Apple roll was the star. It was large with lots of apples and mildly sweet cinnamon base. Walking around the market got me a lot of good looks from everyone!"
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a great place to get a pastry before attempting to visit the original Starbucks or just walking around the waterfront. There is no seating with an often long wait, but hopefully you too can buy a sweet object of attention as you enjoy downtown Seattle."
,,,,,Every time I'm in Seattle I stop here and get myself some tasty treats and I'm never disappointed. Everything is fresh and delicious and they're very friendly. Always willing to be patient and answer questions. Stop here when you're in Pike's place you won't regret it!
,,,,,"Authentic Russian bakery and a must check out snack spot when visiting Seattle. There is usually a line out the door that moves very quickly. I snacked on the salmon pate, beef and cheese sandwich, and beef and onion piroshky."
,,,,,These pastries and sandwiches were delicious. You can tell everything here is really fresh. You can choose between sweet or savory. Glad I stopped by because this place has some yummy snacks
,,,,,"We're glad you stopped by too, Khoi. Glad you enjoyed the salmon and the beef piroshkies. Hope you get a chance to come again. Thanks!"
,,,,,"That salmon Piroshky is worth flying back to Seattle for, not even exaggerating."
,,,,,"The line moves relatively quickly so make sure you decide your order and stick to it. Or be able to make that split second decision. There is a worker who is in control of the line who can show you a menu with the different Piroshky options, too. Each Piroshky is a little pricier than a typical pastry - but you can totally eat one (maybe two if you're starving) as a meal - so still cheaper than a usual lunch out at a restaurant."
,,,,,"I highly recommend the smoked salmon pate Piroshky and the beef and onion Piroshky. The salmon is so light but clearly there - I could literally eat that one all day. The beef and onion is super savory and delicious, but the salmon pate Piroshky has my heart. I also had a chance to try the apple cinnamon roll - it tasted like any standard apple pastry, but it was definitely a very insta-worthy snack. "
,,,,,"So yes, Piroshky Piroshky is worth the wait. And YES, make sure you at least order the Smoked Salmon Pate. Done and done."
,,,,,"I want to start with a con, not for the wrong reason. The store is fantastic and super popular, making it longer for many customers to wait in line for a long time. The good note of this excellent food place is you can yelp order which was super helpful to order online here, grab your food and go. The flavors for each bread I got were so delicious."
,,,,,"Apple Cinnamon Roll, this is what I got and I was quite disappointed. This review is purely for the Apple Cinnamon Roll. Definitely the picture in the menu is quite deceiving as it shows many slices of apples, not much on the actual pastry. The pastry was a bit disappointing in the taste and quite average at best... I will have to come back to try a savory item..."

,,,,,Most popular is the Salmon Pate 
,,,,,"My personal favorite was the Salmon Pate and the Bacon, hashbrown, egg, and cheese one."
,,,,,tip:  by the time you get to the door it's basically your turn already.
,,,,,"There was about 20 people in line when I arrived. I stood in line with a friend so the line seemed like it went fast. I would say I probably waited no more than 25 mins on a Monday late morning.  I feel like I didn't have time to view the pastries. Wendy was the one who helped me out.  She was very nice even though I bombarded her with questions about each piroshky. She answered which ones her favorite and which ones the most popular. She was very helpful. They all seemed very fast, proficient, and  friendly. Very small busy store. "
,,,,,"I ended up getting the Salmon pate, Beef and onion, Hazelnut, and The Bacon, hash brown, egg and cheese.  Eat it while its hot! I have nothing to regret with my decisions waiting and line and getting these. the only regret is I didn't get all the flavors."
,,,,,"What a great write-up, Jason. Glad you found our staff helpful and thanks so much for coming!"
,,,,,Yelp COLLUDED with Russia to highjack my diet when I was in Seattle. 
,,,,,"It all started when I opened up the Yelp app while at Pike Place Market and typed ""bakery"" in the search field. Russian bots must have infiltrated my device because Piroshky Piroshky came up on top."
,,,,,"The rest of the evidence was all swallowed, but photographic proof of all the sweet and savory carbs has been preserved (see exhibits A, B, C, and D and below):"
,,,,,"*SMOKED SALMON PATE: filled with cream cheese, dill, and onion, and every bit as good as most say it is"
,,,,,*WHOLE BAKED APPLE: a huge whole apple wrapped in a full pastry filled with sweet cream that should satisfy any cravings for sweets
,,,,,"*BACON HASH EGG & CHEESE PIROSHKY: this savory hand held pie is a good alternative to a bfast sandwich, but if you're only gonna get one savory item, go with the salmon pate"
,,,,,"*APPLE CINNAMON ROLL: you can't go wrong with their top selling item, it's a more traditional item than the baked apple"
,,,,,"One contact wasn't enough, as I visited twice during my 3 day trip. Someone from Robert Mueller's office is probably going to be paying me a visit."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Was visiting Seattle for 3 days from LA, and had to have a piroshki from this spot twice. The beef and onion, rhubarb, and salmon are to die for! If you must choose one, choose the salmon, you will not regret it."
,,,,,"Wow! You need to come here! I got the salmon pate piroshky. Enough said. It was like a handheld meal, before to walk around and eat. The salmon had a lot of flavor. Everything tasted well balanced and made sense. Yum!"
,,,,,"I am not from Seattle and ended up going to this place while we were walking in that area, hence my review of it is completely unbiased :P"
,,,,,"This is one of the freshest bakeries i have been to! Each time i go to Seattle, i wait in line for their amazing garlic bread! Sooo soft and buttery! Even the people serving here are friendly and welcoming!"
,,,,,"So very delicious. Can't wait to go back. Post Covid, of course. I'm staying home these days. But, I'll be back as soon as I can. Thanks!!!"
,,,,,Good god where do I begin? This place is worth the hype and a Pike Place absolute must. Was in Seattle for two days and stopped in two different times. This is clearly a busy place and they have their flow on lock. You wait in line on the street and someone ushers you in like an amusement ride. It makes it that much more worth it when you get inside. There are menus that get passed around so you're prepared to make a choice when you go in. If you go at a busy time be warned they may sell out of the popular ones. We tried a few but I bet all of them are good. Not to mention the staff is super friendly. 
,,,,,So much delicious warm savory and sweet options. Also upon walking around there is another location in the city I believe on 3rd? You don't get the market experience but they have the same delicious pillows. A Seattle must 100%!
,,,,,"I LOVE carbs!! I knew I had to visit Piroshky Piroshky when I came to Seattle. Several friends have recommended this place as well, so I wanted to come and see what the hype was about. "
,,,,,"Although the line can get long, it moves fairly quickly. They have menus moving around as you're waiting in line, so you can order right away when you go to the counter. The lady upfront is great at managing the lines and making sure there's a clear walk way as well as advertising their products. She's very friendly and will answer any questions you may have."
,,,,,"WOW! That was my impression when I first took a bite into the salmon piroshky and the cinammon cardamom bun. The salmon piroshky was perfectly smokey without being overwhelming. I've never had cardamom before, but I've heard my friends raving about this spice, so I just intrigued. The earthy aroma paired nicely with the cinnamon and the raisins gave a chewy texture."
,,,,,"Their pastries are warm, fluffy, and simply delightful. There are so many different options to choose from, but just not enough time or stomach space to try every single item. I dream about this place everyday and I can't wait for the day I can come back and devour all those pastries yet again!"
,,,,,I am not impressed. The salmon roll was cool then we got the cheese and beef roll that was just flat-out atrocious the flavor was not even bearable to eat or should I say unbearable what a waste of 40 dollars.
,,,,,"The smells of pastries wafting through the air lured me to this spot. The line was short on a Friday morning at 9am, just out the door. We got to watch them make the piroshkys while we waited, which only built the anticipation. I had the seasonal Pumpkin toffee almond braid and my friend had the ham and cheese one. "
,,,,,"The pumpkin almond toffee braid was TO DIE FOR. I fell in love with it 100% recommend it. My friend's piroshky was flaky and warm and it had thick pieces of ham within it. She said she liked mine more though. In the end, we both inevitably ended up wanting more."
,,,,,Absolutely delicious. Tried both the smoked salmon and their vegan option. Both were 5 stars! Cant wait to come back!
,,,,,"Hi Jenn, "
,,,,,Thanks so much for your review! We can't wait to have you back!
,,,,,A must go to spot when you are traveling to Seattle.  Best seller is salmon pate. There's no other place like this.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"It was fine, definitely not a 4 1/2 star worthy snack. Still good to just pick up and go."
,,,,,"The place is amazing! I was brought here last year when I flew to Seattle for the first time for PAX! And my friend was touring me around and highly recommended this place. The line at that time goes out the door, and now still does! "
,,,,,"This place is known for their smoked salmon, curry rice, beef & cheese and potatoe and cheese. Honestly you can't go wrong w their top 4! I have yet to had an had experience!"
,,,,,"Their pastries are fresh and fills your tummy with just one or two! My top two are smoked salmon, curry rice! "
,,,,,"Came back this year and it was the one must haves to me! The place is super tiny, literally like a stand, yet always crowded with people buying to gos! "
,,,,,It's a 2 min walk from pike's market! And it's super worth! See all the other reviews if you don't believe all that I am vouching for!:)
,,,,,"This is a great local Seattle gem. If you are visiting, definitely check out the one near Pikes Place. If you're in a rush, get the one up the street near the McDonalds on 3rd Ave. "
,,,,,Make sure to ask them which Piroshky just came out of the oven.
,,,,,Delicious-must-try if you're already at Pikes Place Market!! I like the Smoked Salmon one!!
,,,,,"I LOVEEE coming to piroshky piroshky. everytime i am in seattle, this is a MUST. i will grab a few and eat alongside the pier. it's the perfect brunch with a hot cup of coffee. :3 "
,,,,,my favorites: 
,,,,,+ always always always get the salmon one. sometimes i'll get more than one :3
,,,,,+ meat pie!!!! 
,,,,,"i think you should try the other ones that pique your interest but i would highly recommend you get steer towards the meat ones. they are the best. enjoy!!!! the lines long, but the piroshky's are warm and worth"
,,,,,"Stumbled upon this place while strolling around the market. We got a hazelnut pastry and a cinnamon twist. We also got a hashbrown, egg, and bacon piroshky which was possibly THE BEST THING I'VE EVER EATEN. I went back the next day because I couldn't stop thinking about it. So good warm or cold. The piroshky was the perfect blend of sweetness from the bread and savory from the filling. Can't recommend this place enough!"
,,,,,Never had a Piroshky prior to my Seattle trip and it was amazing! I was able to try one at their other location in a mall then the one in Pike's place. 
,,,,,"You want to stand in line for Pike's place, definitely worth it. They came out warm so you could enjoy it immediately. The outside was nice and flakey and so many options for the filling (as long as they aren't sold out of your favorite!) it's nice that you can see them make the food in front of you, they stay busy! "
,,,,,The menu is straightforward and even let's you know what the popular items are. I went with the beef & cheese. 
,,,,,"Honestly I'm not even sure what the seating looked like for the store since I just waiting in line, grabbed my order and walked out to continue my day. "
,,,,,The portions were perfect. Enough to get you through playing tourist to enjoy the next meal :) 
,,,,,Wish they had one in Vegas!
,,,,,"Great to hear that you got to try your first piroshky at our bakery, Gina. Thanks for coming! No immediate plans to move to Vegas at the moment, but if you're curious, we ship. ;)"
,,,,,"Provender: I ordered the beef and cheese and the cheddar and garlic roll. Both were excellent, but the beef was more filling and savory. This place is a must-try if you're at Pike Place Market."
,,,,,Prices: one piroshky will run you under $7.
,,,,,"Parking: there are various lots for Pike Place Market, so you can park there. There's also street metered parking north/west of 1st Ave."
,,,,,People: fun for all.
,,,,,"Perks: there's no seating, so after you order you'll have to move on out. But you can munch on these goodies while exploring Pike Place Market. There's usually a line, but it moves fairly quickly. It's almost adjacent to the first Starbucks."
,,,,,"What a great review, John. Thank you! Glad you enjoyed the beef and cheese and hope you get a chance to come again."
,,,,,"Let me tell you, this place gets BUSY. It's a small market with limited seating and doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. Piroshky Piroshky is a must stop pastry shop located near Pike Place Market. The employees get through lines quickly and are very friendly. They offer sweet, savory, and pastries that match a vegan diet as well! Each bite of a piroshky is fresh, soft, and fulfilling. They've mastered the perfect amount of filling versus dough. I definitely recommended you try this for yourself!"
,,,,,"One of the places I was most excited to try during my trip to Seattle, and it did not disappoint! I think I came here pretty much every day because of how obsessed I am with the pastries here. "
,,,,,"I think their savory pastries are generally a lot better than their sweet ones. I recommend the smoked salmon pate as well as the beef & cheese pastries. Every bite of the smoked salmon pate pastry was filled with salmon so you definitely get what you pay for. The bread is also in the shape of a fish so it's pretty cute. Meanwhile, the beef & cheese pastry is filled with stuffing so when you first bite into it, flavor just bursts in your mouth. The beef & cheese pastry is a bit heavier so I highly recommend sharing that one. But in all honesty, I would share all the pastries so you can try a lot of different ones!"
,,,,,"There is usually a line, but it moves pretty quickly. I highly recommend looking at the menu beforehand so you have a rough idea of what to order or any questions you might have. If you don't have the chance to look beforehand, usually a baker will pass down a menu and help with recommendations as you wait."
,,,,,"Line was out the door, but quick service and fresh baked goods! Good variety of sweet and savory with huge serving sizes. Can't wait to go back."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This was a highly recommended place by a friend so we e we're pretty hyped. This was our first stop upon arriving at Seattle early morning. We got the salmon pate and apple. One sweet, one savory so we can try both. These two items were recommended by one of the employees. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of either of them. The salmon one was cold, I felt like it would've been a lot better when eat semi-hot. They heated up the apple one for us, but it was also very mediocre. It tasted like an apple pie and Cinnabon morphed into one."
,,,,,"It was our first time in Seattle, so we had to check out the legendary fish market. I thought it was maybe one pavilion with just fish, not six square blocks of boutiques and eateries of every stripe! We were there on a Sunday, so the entire area was mobbed with tourists, including us, and we took our time wandering through looking for the must-do places. What first caught our eye about Piroshky Piroshky was the long line of people streaming out its door and down the block. Feeling peckish, and recognizing a great Polish bakery when we see one, we got in line ourselves."
,,,,,"What really impressed me was the number of savory options they had, as I typically think of a bakery as someplace to get cakes and pastries only. They do have sweet options, but you can get baked items made with meat or vegetables as well, which is the type of food to go I like to get and go. I don't even recall which one we ordered, all I can say is that it had potatoes and it was delicious and easy to eat. I understand that long line. If we didn't want to explore the entire area we would have just hung out there."
,,,,,"Hi Daniel,"
,,,,,Thanks for the awesome review! We are happy to hear you would hang out with us all day! We hope you had a great time in Seattle and can't wait to see you again!
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,It is a hole in the wall for sure but they treat you like family and their food is worth driving all the way from Bellevue for!
,,,,,"I'm not really sure what the buzz is about. I had a pretty lackluster experience eating their sweet pastry. I'm not sure if it's because I got the wrong kind but I deliberately got the ""bestseller"" thinking it would be a good choice. "
,,,,,"Apple Cinnamon Roll: apples were undercooked, pastry was a bit crisped, and not enough cinnamon. "
,,,,,Cinnamon Cardamon Braid: I tasted more bread than anything else. It wasn't as sweet as I thought and some parts of the pastry was bland. 
,,,,,"In addition to the lackluster pastries, I wasn't happy about the price. It's a little pretentious to be charging lackluster food. "
,,,,,The only part I enjoyed about this visit was the speed of the line despite it being pretty long. My wait time was about 5 minutes which wasn't bad at all. I do want to point out that the shop is super small which is why it seems like there's a line every time you stop by. 
,,,,,"Overall, it was good to try but I wouldn't come back."
,,,,,"Hi Bob,"
,,,,,We're really sorry to hear that our piroshkies didn't meet your expectations! We hope you can give us another chance the next time you're in town.
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,Such a cute small mom and pop shop. Their pastries were so fresh and flavorful. They have both dessert and savory ones and they were all so delicious. I would highly recommend their salmon pate and white chocolate cherry ones! There's always a line but it moves super fast.
,,,,,"Great food experience. We had the smoked salmon, beef and cheese, and Rhubarb Piroshky. Dough was nicely  baked (would've preferred more flakiness) and the filling was proportional to the baked good itself."
,,,,,overpriced for size but Amazing vegan options and packed with flavor! Sometimes a little less warm than I'd like but I love getting a quick $7 breakfast.
,,,,,I came here for one thing in particular and that was the popular cinnamon braid. So it's hard to give a full review just based off of one item.
,,,,,Waiting in line in mid afternoon wasn't too bad.
,,,,,Line moves pretty quickly. And there is an employee controlling the line when it builds up outside.
,,,,,I came here the day before to get a cinnamon braid but was too late.
,,,,,So plan on coming here fairly early to get the most popular items.
,,,,,The cinnamon braid is well worth coming here just for it alone.
,,,,,Friendly staff.
,,,,,"I am not going to leave a bad review. But I only come here a few times a year from Portland Oregon for one item at piroshky. Due to Covid and the menu is cut in half. They no longer have my Carrot, potato, and sauerkraut. I will no longer go here anymore. Still a great place..."
,,,,,"Going on scent alone, this is a great find. We were walking around on our first day in the city and were pulled into the hallway adjacent to this shop by the smell of sweetness and spice wafting on the air. "
,,,,,"We stood in line the next morning, eagerly awaiting our turn at the counter. The line was long, but not terrible. My husband saved our place while I went around to the hallway from the previous day to take pictures of the menu. We used that to plan our pastry purchases."
,,,,,"We decided to get one savory and one sweet pastry to share. That was the easy part. The difficulty came in agreeing on which pastries to buy. I wanted the Oscar's Star and either the Spinach, Egg and Cheese or Mozzarella, Mushroom and Broccoli. Hubs wanted the Coffee Cinnamon Roll and the Beef and Cheese."
,,,,,"We compromised with the coffee cinnamon and the spinach, egg and cheese right before we got to the front of the line. We placed our order...only to be told they'd sold out of the spinach. We asked for the mozzarella mushroom - sold out. So guess what we ended up with? Yeah, the beef and cheese. At least my husband was happy, since he got both items he wanted. "
,,,,,"We were able to snag a couple barstools inside the shop - it's tight in there, but they do offer a small counter with four barstools. We took the pastries out of their bags and started to dive in."
,,,,,"They were good but would've been worlds better had they been served hot. Or even warm. I know warming individual orders would make the wait even longer, but I really think the pastries would benefit from that."
,,,,,"I did enjoy the coffee cake. It's filled with cinnamon and coffee grounds, so I was expecting a zing that wasn't there. The dough was flaky and crunchy. The beef and cheddar definitely needed heat; apparently there was a pocket of cheese in the center of the pastry that only my husband experienced, having taken a giant bite out of it and ending up with the cheese pocket in his mouth."
,,,,,"You can watch the bakers making the pastries either in the front window or in the hallway. They definitely take pride in their product, but I think the experience would be helped by a warming drawer and an updated sign, letting buyers know what's sold out for the day before they get to the counter."

,,,,,After many years of visiting Seattle I finally braved the busy street in Pikes Place market and waited in line to try one of the famous baked goods. The good news is it was a rare beautiful winter day in Seattle so I didn't mind standing in line and it only took about five minutes. I appreciated that a staff member clearly lined everyone up and made sure they had menus and decided on their order ahead of time before being directed inside to grab their food and pay.
,,,,,"I split the Beef & Onion and the Potato & Cheese. If you're visiting from out of town and are craving something warm, savory, and classic, get these. Both piroshki reminded me of familiar flavors in Eastern Europe while living abroad. The pastry is flaky and the stuffed buns are served warm. Check this off your Seattle bucket list while visiting the OG Starbucks while strolling the market!"
,,,,,"Thank you so much for visiting us in Seattle! We'd like to show you how much we appreciate the support, and visit YOU (Denver)! We are coming out to Denver THIS WEEKEND, but there's only a short time left to order. Please check out "
,,,,, or feel free to give us a call if you have any questions  (206)764-1000
,,,,,Hope to see you there!
,,,,,Here's a not-so-secret: Come early before opening because there will be a line even 30 min before the door opens.
,,,,,"What to get? Get their beef & cheese and smoked salmon! The smoked salmon pate is pretty flavorful although a part of me was disappointed in wanting more smoked salmon inside the bun, but hey the flavors are good though. The beef & cheese is definitely the juicier one! I kind of wish I bought a second one ..."
,,,,,"Overall, prices are fair and you definitely get what you pay for. Service is pretty quick but definitely come early because there will be a long line!"
,,,,,"There's always a line here at any time of day, but I like that they are efficient and move the line quickly. I came here to try their famous Salmon Pate. People have raved about how good it is, but I think the flavor is just ok. I like that it was fresh and the salmon and cream cheese blended well, but it wasn't spectacular. This place didn't live up to the hype, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
,,,,,OMG! I didn't pick up this food at the actual bakery! But this salmon patty was so amazing and fresh! I can't complain! I also tried. A lemon croissant type of pastry! And it hit the spot! So amazing and a must try! If you end up visiting Seattle
,,,,,"Every day I went to Pike Place Market and this spot had a long line. My third day I was super hungry and searched some restaurants on Yelp and this spot showed up so I decided to give it a try. Waited in the long line that went by quick. They had a system that got people in and out in less than 5 mins each person. I opted for the smoked salmon piroshky and it did not disappoint one bit!! Super delicious, very fulfilling, highly recommend this one!"
,,,,,"Such a great snack or even breakfast especially if you're going to walk around pike place. The lines are usually long but don't be afraid because it moves very quickly. I tried a breakfast-y Piroshky with bacon and hash browns as well as the smoked salmon pate one. Both were delicious especially while they were still warm. However, I preferred the salmon one. The breakfast one was a little heavy for me so early in the morning. "
,,,,,The bread was super fluffy and warm. Definitely felt like comfort food on a brisk morning.
,,,,,"Small to-go shop. The flavor was underwhelming. I thought from the smell it would be amazing, but I didn't find anything crazy special about it. The bread was nice and soft but the beef on the inside was lacking in explosive flavor. I'll have to go back and try some other things, but as a first impression, sadly I can't say I'm impressed :("
,,,,,Great staff friendly service and fresh food! Convenient location. Prices were a little pricey. But our meal was well worth the cost
,,,,,Yummy unique desserts in the heart of downtown and the classic Pike Market. I kept hearing I needed to try this Russian pastry shop and I am happy I did! We stopped by the location outside of the market to try to avoid some of the lines (although I heard they moved fast!). 
,,,,,"We tried a veggie one, the apple cinnamon and the cinnamon cardamom. The savory one was honestly ok, just not my type. But the Apple and the cinnamon ones were deeeeelicious!! Very unique. Definitely a place to try in Seattle!"
,,,,,"Absolutely delicious! The line moves very quickly so don't be turned away by it. When I went the line was on the street and turned twice and I had my pastries in about 15 mins. Thy are baked fresh and continuously during the day. They have a variety of sweet or savory with many flavors so you're bound to find something you like. I tried the chocolate cream hazelnut roll which I wasn't impressed with. I was expecting more of a Nutella flavor from it, but it had a sweet chocolate cream that tasted a little watered down and then the bread had some hazelnuts on it. I also tried the cinnamon cardamom braid, which was less sweet and I liked the flavor of more. I would love to come back to try others!"
,,,,,"Hi Sara,"
,,,,,"Thank you for the review! We're sorry to hear that the Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll was a disappointment, but we are happy to hear the other ones you tried were great! Thank you for coming by, we can't wait to see you again!"
,,,,,"Thank you,"

,,,,,"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE! This is by no means lives up to the hype. Spent almost $30, we got the beef and Onion, curry chicken and rice, chocolate hazelnut, and the Moscow Bavarian cream. "
,,,,,"The Beef and Onion was the only redeeming factor of our experience here. The beef was juicy, perfectly flaky dough, and delicious until the last bite. "
,,,,,"Sadly, I can't say the same for the rest of our haul. The curry chicken was fine, I'd give it a 2.5/5. I expected the curry flavor to be more bold but instead you're given a very very light taste of curry and a ton of rice. "
,,,,,"The chocolate hazelnut was honestly, just disgusting. The chocolate hazelnut cream was more of a heavily gelatinous pudding and the dough left a gross aftertaste. "
,,,,,"Lastly, the Bavarian cream was beyond dry. For something that's advertised as creamy, this was the absolute opposite. There was a strange dry, gritty paste on the inside."
,,,,,"I'm not one to write reviews often, but the disappointment from here illicited one."
,,,,,The corned beef and veggies was a colossal fail .   Now I'm stuck with 4 more in my freezer.  Yuck.
,,,,,"Lineups even when it is raining, says a lot. Although my sister told me the line wasn't as long as in the summer. They provided umbrellas because it was raining, which was really sweet. They gave us menus to look at as well while we waited. There were a bunch that we wanted to try, but we decided on one savoury and one sweet to share. Originally we wanted the potato and cheese one, but they didn't have anymore. So we got the salmon pate, which had smoked salmon and cream cheese. This one was pretty good. It felt like a bagel with cream cheese and lox, but easier to eat. I liked how the bread wasn't too thick. The sweet one we got was the poppy seed and cinnamon roll. This was pretty good. Not overly sweet. It also had some raisins in it as well. "
,,,,,"Overall, everyone that works there is super friendly. The baked goods we tried were tasty and I'd want to come back to try other ones. Just a note that this is definitely a grab and go kind of place. It is quite tiny inside."
,,,,,Must visit in Pike Place Market.  I got the Smoked Salmon Pate.  It was amazing.  Warm buttery outside with creamy salmon inside.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  This is one of the rare places I would go back to again on a trip.  Usually I want to try all new spots.  It is that good.  
,,,,,Don't be afraid of the long line.  It moves quick.  Be ready when it is your turn so you don't hold up the line.
,,,,,This place is  the best!!! I had the savory selection of cabbage and then one with potato/ mushroom. It was great! Not the kind my mom makes but for a restaurant pretty fantastic! 
,,,,,They are a bit expensive ranging from 5-8 a piece but very good. When I went the line was pretty short but I heard it can be kinda crazy
,,,,,My all type favorite is their smoked salmon piroshky! Its truly a culinary invention...
,,,,,Came here just for the famous salmon piroshky and that was all I got. It was indeed great! First of all there was a line but it moved quickly. The price is  not the cheapest but it's not bad ($7.50 for a piroshky). 
,,,,,The piroshky was lukewarm. First bite gave me a delightful feeling as it was warm and soft.  There was a lot of salmon filling and it tasted great.  After a few bites you might get a bit bored of the taste but overall it tasted great!  The best part was the dough.  It was unexpectedly soft and airy.  The bread wasn't loose at all.  Together with the moderately warmth  the bread  was much tastier than the filling.  This is a must try pastry if you are a first timer at Pike Place! Highly recommend!

Highly recommend it!
,,,,,"People didn't lie when they told me Piroshky Piroshky is a must go to place in Seattle. We went around noon time on a Sunday and waited in line for around half hour, but the wait was sooo worth it!! Highly recommend the Beef and Cheese one, really hit the spot! The Apple Cinnamon Roll was also very delicious, but a little hard to eat since it's quite big."
,,,,,Absolutely coming back and definitely recommend to anyone who hasn't been!
,,,,,"TL; DR Smoked Salmon Pate is amazing, Try to visit 10-15 minutes before they open to avoid long lines, Know what you want before you get to the front of the line!"
,,,,,"This place is pretty awesome!  When ever I find myself in Seattle, Piroshky Piroshky is always on my list of top places to visit during my stay or layover.  "
,,,,,"The lines are always super long, no matter the time of day! I always make it a point to try and get in line right when they open.  Not only do I not have to wait more than 15 minutes to order, I get to watch them bake their wonderful pastries!  "
,,,,,"Walking around the Pike Place Market, one can not help but gravitate towards the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen of this place!  I love salmon, so naturally I always get the smoked salmon pate.  My boyfriend always gets something different but his favorite is the beef and cheese.  "
,,,,,The smoked salmon pate is basically smoked salmon with cream cheese mixed together and stuffed inside a wonderful flaky pastry.  This is the perfect snack while walking around the market or sitting and admiring Seattle's beautiful landscape.  
,,,,,"Service is always a bit rushed, so if possible, know what you want ahead of time!!!  There always seems to be a line at this place, but I found that getting in line 10-15 minutes before they open or in the middle of the day like 2pm, the lines aren't as long."
,,,,,"The food here is amazing. I was traveling to Seattle from LA and some of my friends told me to make sure that I go and taste their piroshkys. I sure am glad I did. I actually got a chance to go twice. The peroshkys are made fresh all day, you can even see them make it in front of you. "
,,,,,"The lines are normally very long, but worth the wait. If you go early in the morning the wait is shorter. Located across the street from Pike's Market. "
,,,,,If you are ever in the area it's a must try. The food is delicious. Period

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,WORTH THE WAIT! Don't listen to any of the people walking by surprised by the line...it's worth the wait.
,,,,,"Since the chances of getting back in line were slim, we took advantage and ordered an assortment of amazing pastries. We ordered the marzipan roll, cabbage and onion roll, Beef and potatoes, potatoes and a cheese, cinnamon cardamon roll, spinach and cheese, and an apple pastry."
,,,,,"These pastries were so freshly made and were a pretty big size too, so even though this place is overpriced (because of the hype) you get more bang for your buck. "
,,,,,"If I had to recommend one sweet and one savory, I would recommend the marzipan roll and the meat pastries, specifically beef. You really can't go wrong! They're perfectly seasoned and savory, I cannot say enough great things about this place. We actually came back twice before leaving and tried a different pastry every time, and were never disappointed! It's a unique kind of pastry and something you probably can't try in your hometown so I say go for it!"
,,,,,"Honestly, I have walked past this bakery several times over the years and seen nothing but a long line waiting to order... Today, there was no line but that's due to the pandemic  The baked goods were delicious and fresh especially the garlic cheddar cheese bread and the apple cinnamon bread. Now I understand why there is always a long line..."
,,,,,"Delicious pastries, situated next to the First Starbucks. Go grab a cup of coffee, walk next door to Pirohky and grab a pastry. I had the smoked salmon pate pastry and wife got the curry chicken and rice. Both were good, but I wish my salmon pate was a bit warmer. My wife's was warm and it was super delicious with a cup of coffee in the cold weather. Definitely worth a try!"
,,,,,"I heard this place is a must see if you happen to be near one of these in Seattle. I got there a minute after the place opened, and there was  already a line which is often a good sign!"
,,,,,The positive: selection is vast and the flavor is great (I tried the potato and cheese and the rhubarb).
,,,,,"The negative: way over priced! $5-7 for an individual peroshok! I might be biased, but my Russian babushka makes better perogies!"
,,,,,"Absolutely worth the hype! Everyone is always sooo sweet and friendly here. Everything is super fresh and I have yet to have a bad thing here. My favorites are the marizpan Piroshky, the cheddar roll, the sausage and then the beef and onion Piroshky. But you honestly can't go wrong with anything you get!"
,,,,,Are they good? Yes
,,,,,"Are they authentic? not all, but they are good"
,,,,,"Are they worth the wait? depends on the time, but 10 mins is acceptable if need to wait"
,,,,,"Are the prices good? Prices are ok, somewhat high for a Pirozhok"
,,,,,"As a Russian I was expecting Piroshky to be like how grandma made them. Not quite, but still they were pretty good. I wish they had a better verity of different types, guess can't have it all. "
,,,,,"Still, I'd recommend checking this place out. Even though it's not quite like grandmas, but they do a good job."
,,,,,"Haven't had this for a while when visiting Seattle as there is usually a long lineup.  When we walked by, the line was short.  When I say short, I mean there was only 15 people.  Usually there is a lot more than that.  The line goes quickly so that is good.  You just hope they have the ones you want when you get to the counter. "
,,,,,"We ordered the beef & onion, and the salmon.  The beef one reminded me of a curry beef Chinese bun but without the curry.  The salmon was good.  We would have ordered more but we were walking around Pike Place and about to go for lunch."
,,,,,Nothing better than standing on a street corner in the middle of winter with the smell of the sea in the air and a hot Piroshky in your hands. Steam poured out of my potato and cheese pastry as I pulled it open. My mouth watered instantly seeing the cheesy goodness inside. A true Seattle Classic.
,,,,,"Came here again, not a surprise anymore considering I've been here literally every other week! I came here around 5:30pm on a Tuesday and there was a short line but it went by quickly. The service was phenomenal this time! The lady answered all my questions perfectly. I ended up getting the smoke salmon Piroshky and the fall limited edition pumpkin cinnamons roll. "
,,,,,The salmon Piroshky was of course delicious as always and the pumpkin cinnamon was surprisingly not as sweet as I expected. It was very delicious and the pumpkin cream cheese on the top was the cherry on top!
,,,,,"I'm seriously obsessed with Piroshky Piroshky! I literally save up my money for this Russian bakery! I usually buy more than two when I'm over here since the line is long. This time, I ordered the potato and cheese Piroshky, smoke salmon pate Piroshky, and marzipan Piroshky. Both the savory Piroshky were great as always but sadly the marzipan Piroshky was a disappointment. It didn't taste as fresh as the others. It was cold and hard from being slightly over baked. The service today was also pretty bad. The female employee was rude and sounded bored. This was a Saturday afternoon too so I expected the service to be top notch. "
,,,,,I've been here over 20 times and never had this happen before so I'm not worried about my next visit here!
,,,,,"It's crazy how many times I've been to Piroshky Piroshky Bakery within this one month. Probably around 8 times! I always order the beef and cheese Piroshky, smoke salmon Piroshky, and marzipan roll but my sister discovered a new fav which are the beef and potato Piroshky and Moscow roll. This one here is the marzipan Piroshky. Doughy, thick, with a dense layer of marzipan filling, this Piroshky def shouldn't be considered a light snack but hey, when touring Seattle, it's all about eating ""small"" snacks along the way rather than eating big meals (at least if you have me as a tour guide )"
,,,,,"I ALWAYS stop by here when I visit Pike Place! If you're wondering how many times I've been here, I would say too many to count! Prob almost 30 times, considering I live here for almost 4 years and they never disappoint! Service and quality of food is always on point; very consistent! The long lines never scare me because I know I'm getting my moneys worth! With that being said, I came here to bring my friends from Texas over to try the famous salmon pate and beef and cheese Piroshky. They loved it so much that we had to come again the next day to order the same! "
,,,,,I strongly recommend for first timers the salmon pate and beef and cheese for savory Piroshky and marzipan or Moscow roll for sweet Piroshky! The price ranges from $5-8.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Always have to drop in to Piroshky Piroshky when in Seattle  growing up I never experienced eating Russian pastries, but wow was I missing out. Service is fast and food is always delicious. I recommend the spinach, egg, cheese Piroshky and the garlic cheese roll. Yummy! FYI there is not anywhere to sit in this location, but there are of course many public places around the market where you can enjoy your pastry."
,,,,,"This is a must hit in Seattle!! It's in the heart of the iconic Pike Place Market and always has a line. Don't fear the line though, it usually goes pretty fast and getting to the front without having a solid plan happens with regularity. Just too many choices!"
,,,,,"My hubs and I came the first time we were in Seattle. I told my g/f on our girl's trip that I HAD to make it in here. She wasn't sure about the hype. But once she took a taste, she wanted to come back so we could a buy a bunch and shuttle it back to Sacramento. Which is exactly what we did! Currently eating it at work right now. So good!"
,,,,,"Standouts - Smoked salmon, potato mushroom, mushroom onion celery, beef and cheese... So delicious!"
,,,,,"We tried the famous salmon pate, beef and cheese, and the chocolate hazelnut. It's good but I think it's overhyped. It's expensive and it's not that good."
,,,,,"The place probably has the longest line out of the others, even longer than Starbucks! But it moves very, very fast. The line starts a little across from the store itself. A lot of people mistakenly thought that there was no line and started lining up outside of the door. I was one of them too. I thought how lucky, the popular place has no line. But worry not, the line moves very, very fast. "
,,,,,"The lady outside will give you a menu to look at once you're almost at the entrance. They have quite a selection. What's good about the menu is that everything has a picture, a name, a price point, and a tag what's the most popular or favorite. You can know exactly what you will order. She can also narrow down for you what's the most popular out of the popular ones, which were exactly what we ordered. Salmon pate is the most popular. And chocolate hazelnut is kids favorite."
,,,,,"Once you get in and order, everything happens very fast. All the bread is ready in the glass counter. So you just need to tell them or point what you want, they'll put them in a bag for you, you'll pay, and get out."
,,,,,"Tastewise, we weren't crazy about it. The bread were all very heavy, except for the sweet one. Which maybe is a good thing for some people. If you're paying 6, 7 bucks for a bread, you want the most meat right. But we like our bread soft and airy. Maybe piroshky is just not for us. And unfortunately, we didn't really like the salmon pate. Why destroy a perfectly good salmon fish and mix it with stuff that weren't really like...salmon. The beef, not crazy about it either. The chocolate was probably our favorite. The bread is soft and sweet. And the hazelnut sauce is kinda chewy kinda saucy."
,,,,,"Awesome pastries located right across the street from Pike Place and a perfect compliment to the original Starbucks next door.  I now understand why this place has the huge number of positive reviews and the successful expansion of this pastry shop.  Of course had to try the signature smoked salmon Piroshky - it was awesome, perfect outside crust with great flavor smoked salmon filling.  Even better than the smoked Salmon was the puff and the potato stuffed pastry.  "
,,,,,Also appreciated the staff friendliness and patience when recommending different options even when they were super busy.
,,,,,"Hello Stephen,"
,,,,,Thank you for the awesome review! We're happy that you had a great experience with our food and our staff! We appreciate the visit and hope to see you again when you're in Seattle next!
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,My husband gives it a 10 out of 5! He had the smoked salmon pirougie and the rhubarb one. The bread was light and the salmon was perfectly cooked. 
,,,,,There is a reason that there is a line out the door!
,,,,,"They have many flavors. I've tried savory and sweet options, all were great. Reasonably priced and easy to eat on the go, no complaints!"
,,,,,"If you love carbs with a savory twist, this is definitely your place. A must try if you are visiting Pike Place. I would get an Butter-flavor Apple Cider right outside to accompany your meal/snack."
,,,,,Get the Beef+Onion pockets or try some of the sausages that are wrapped in bread. 
,,,,,"It is a small place, but it is very organized and smells extremely good in the actual store. "
,,,,,"They have a menu that separates the pastries in Savory or Sweet. The first time I came here, I got one of each and split it with a friend at the time. The most recent time I went was my second time going and I tried two savory ones. The pasties are definitely big enough to share."
,,,,,I visited Piroshky Piroshky during my first and only visit to Seattle a whole seven years ago and still remember the aroma of the freshly-baked delicious pastries waiting to be served from the display of the cozy store at Pike Place Market. 
,,,,,"It may be because I'm spoiled with the plethora of Armenian and Russian bakeries in my area at the end of every street that have showed me an array of how a real piroshky tastes like, but the desserts at this store weren't something that I hadn't seen or tasted before. The presentation is something you won't forget because of some of the oversized doughnuts and other such sweets...but again, if it weren't for the tourist attraction that it has become and the fact that it's on the way to the first-ever Starbucks location, I wouldn't go out of my way."
,,,,,"Regardless, one of my close friends visited Piroshky Piroshky and brought me back a delectable almond pastry which I selfishly kept to myself. The soft, cloud-like pastry was filled with a delicious, pasty almond filling and topped with powdered sugar. I tried to savor each bite and stretched it out for two days before finishing it. "
,,,,,"It's definitely a cute place to visit if you've never been, but next time I'm in town I'd be intrigued to leave behind the cluster that is the Pike Place Market and explore other hidden treasures in the area."
,,,,,The bacon hash brown egg is the one to get!  I bought two in one day and I don't care about the calories!  I'm going to enjoy both today.  The potatoes in the Piroshky are so good.
,,,,,"Definitely a must-try when you visit Seattle! I got their beef & cheese, which is their bestseller and best tasting one in my opinion. The ground beef works really well with the cheese, and on a cold day it was perfect! My friends got the potato & cheese and smoked salmon pate, which they said was really good!  "
,,,,,"What I wouldn't recommend getting is the Uli's jalapeño & cheese sausage which was kinda cold, and the sausage skin was hard to bite off. I also got the apple cinnamon roll, which I thought was just average."
,,,,,"There is a line, but it goes by pretty quickly, and you can definitely use that waiting time to pick what you wanna order. Pricing wise, I thought it was pretty expensive for such a small portion, but I would still definitely try on a Seattle trip."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Classic piroshky's at this location.  Unfortunately, due to COVID, the traffic has been fairly low for the business, but it's been easier to grab a bite to eat from here!.  In general, I'd recommend going with the salmon, but all are quite good.  Just be careful about eating so much because of those carbs!"
,,,,,"I never skip this place when I'm in Seattle. Pre-COVID, the line to get into this place would be insanely long. I recently visited Piroshky Piroshky on a Sunday afternoon, maybe about an hour before closing and there were only 2 parties ahead of us. They have so many options to choose from but I always grab their Salmon Pate Piroshky, it is just undefeated. It's so creamy and salmony and the crust is so flakey - yum! We also grabbed their Cinnamon Cardamom Piroshky and it had such a good balance of both the cinnamon and cardamom. It would be absolutely delicious if enjoyed fresh or warmed."
,,,,,I love this place and I can see why it's so popular! There's usually a long line but it's not too slow. 
,,,,,"During my stay in Seattle, I probably went to this place three of four times. I've gotten a number of items here but my favorites include the salmon pate and the beef and onion pastry! Both of them have a nice crispy texture on the outside but the beef and onion one is flakier. I found both the fillings so flavorful. Usually, eating two (or three if I work really hard) was enough to make me full. I've tried a few of their sweeter pastry like the cinnamon apple bun and while they weren't bad, the savory ones were definitely better! "
,,,,,"The staff was also just so friendly and nice! Even though they were taking so many orders, they still remained really friendly. "
,,,,,I wish I could have taken some home but will definitely be back to get more pastries!
,,,,,"I haven't had too many piroshkies before, but this place was always busy when I went. The potato ones and meat ones are good. Sometimes can be a little dry though."
,,,,,"Came to this place during my tripe to Seattle.  As I was walking Pikes Place, I noticed the long line to this place and decided to see what the hype is all about.  The staff were doing their best to get everyone in and out to tend to the guests waiting in line.  That is appreciated.  So make sure you know what you want prior to getting up to order.  I had the ham and cheese and the strawberry heart.  The ham and chees was good and filling.  The strawberry heart was okay.  A good place overall."
,,,,,Today seemed like a great day for a piroshky. I took some photos of the menu to examine more carefully while I waited in line. By 10am they already ran out of the beef & onion and salmon pate. Nooooooo!!! 
,,,,,"I sampled the beef & cheese, jalapeno sausage, and the marzipan. They were all really well made, but the marzipan really stood out. These pastries are made from scratch with good ingredients; they are really quality. You will taste it, and you will pay a little more for it compared to other places. All in all, I'm a fan. I gotta come back to try those other flavors."
,,,,,"Omg, I'm so mad I didn't take any pictures of the names of the pastries we got! The first one we got was sooo good, it had the perfect amount of sweet and bread. Currently craving one while I write this review. Again, this was one of the places we went back to so we could try other things. The second time around, we got two pastries that had salmon and chicken and mushroom. The salmon one was so delicious, not surprising! We were so stuffed from dinner, but it was so good we finished the whole thing. The other pastry wasn't as good, but it wasn't bad either. "
,,,,,Coming back for more when in Seattle!
,,,,,Yum! I was strolling around Pike Place and decided to stop by because of the long line (mob mentality). I'm definitely glad I did! I ordered the almond croissant and was blown away. I only wished I stopped by another time to try more items - perhaps something savory.
,,,,,"The prices are definitely inflated due to location/popularity, but it's worth a visit. I had never visited a Russian bakery, and now I know to look out for them!"
,,,,,"Hi there Megan,"
,,,,,"Thank you for the positive review and for stopping by! Next time you're in town, please do try one of the savory items! The Smoked Salmon Pate and Beef & Cheese are always a good choice!"
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,"The line says it all!  I really wish I had this place in my home town. I could eat Piroshki all day long and these were wonderful. So fresh, tasty, and warm. Mmmmm, I can't say enough about this place. It is clearly worth the wait in line to get your hands on some of these piroshki. If you think you are going to have a  little snack before dinner, nope, it's not gonna happen. You will get inside the shop after waiting in line, feel the pressure to order quickly, and not want to miss any of the delicious delicacies in the counter in front of you. You'll order 3 times the amount you came in for and enjoy every bite of them. You may even finish 1/2 of them before you make it to a nice seating area!"
,,,,,Don't let the line turn you away. It moves quickly and it's definitely worth the wait!
,,,,,"What an amazing review, Marc. Thanks so much for coming! Hope you get a chance to visit again, but if you're curious, we ship. ;)"
,,,,,"Finally came this day when I walked by a Piroshky (esp. the Pike market one), there was barely a line. How would I miss this perfect chance to try the well-known smoked salmon pate, even though I was not hungry at all? I hopped into the line without a second of hesitation, and got my long overdue smoked salmon pate. "
,,,,,"I bit off the tail right away. It was so crispy, with the hint of sweetness of baked dough. I took another bite and reached the salmon part. The smoked salmon blended just right with the cheese - neither one was overwhelming or stronger than the other. I was never a fan of smoked salmon or cheese, but this combo was wonderful. The other ingredients (dill & onion) added slight scent to the pastry, which improved the variety of the overall flavor by a lot. "
,,,,,"It was very satisfying for me that I finally tried the smoked salmon pate. Was it delicious? Absolutely yes! Was it overpriced? Yes, quite ($6.85 + tax). Was it worth the wait? 10 minutes: sure; 20+ minutes: oh definitely no."
,,,,,Came here on a Friday morning around 10am. The storefront was already packed with people. The service was fast so we only waited inline briefly.
,,,,,"We chose a savory piroshky: beef cheese, and a sweet one: cherry and white chocolate piroshky. "
,,,,,The beef cheese one is quite tasty but mundane: a simple ground beef with cheese filling inside a square shaped bun. I enjoyed it but it was not worth my wait.
,,,,,"The cherry and white chocolate is what made my day! They used real tart cherries, which maintained the original texture of fresh cherries. Their sour flavor perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the white chocolate chips. The amount of white chocolate was just right - it gave the pastry a slight chocolate taste but did not take away the main focus of the cherries."
,,,,,"Definitely coming back to try their smoked salmon pate, ham cheese spinach, chicken curry rice (pretty much everything from their savory section), marzipan roll, apricot turnover, and chocolate cream hazelnut roll!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,We came here for an early lunch and there was already a line forming! The line went pretty quickly and it was nice they had someone passing out menus to help us figure out what we wanted before getting in the restaurant. The service is quick once you order as most items were ready to go and just grab from the display case
,,,,,I went with the beef and onion- I really enjoyed the flavor and crispness of the crust as well. Definitely worth checking out while in Seattle! 
,,,,,There are a lot of sweet / dessert options as well that looked like they were tasty options.
,,,,,"Hi there Lisa,"
,,,,,Thank you for the kind words! We love the beef and onion as well. We're happy you stopped by!
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,Always a must-go when at pikes place. Very small seating area (4 stools) but the line is always quick and the staff is excellent despite being constantly busy. I recommend the apple piroshky if you want sweet and the salmon or the spinach/cheese piroshky if you want something savory.
,,,,,"The smell of the piroshky was heavenly. My favorite are the beef/cheese, salmon pattê, beef/onion. Just one fills me up for breakfast!"
,,,,,We came here at a perfect time- early in the morning around 9:30am there was no line! We got the beef and cheese and the smoked salmon. I loved the smoked salmon more!
,,,,,FEw time I go to Piroshky Piroshky due my Czech Culture is sooo AMAZING! I am proud of Czech 77%
,,,,,Really Good Yummy.. I am part of food that I grew up. Their different .. it is really best taste! I ate .. love it.
,,,,,"DELICIOUS! A must-try if you are coming to Pike Market. Their pastries are so delicious and they have many options! This time I got a beef and cheese piroshky and a marzipan roll. They were great! The beef and cheese is very flavorful and super easy to walk around the market eating. I think the marzipan roll is amazing. I am a sucker for marzipan and this one was fresh and super almond-y. Not too sweet, but perfect as a dessert. The location is easy to find, but very small. "
,,,,,You basically walk up to the counter and see the case filled with piroshkys. The employees are friendly and helpful! I definitely recommend coming here!
,,,,,So I have seen this spot walking around pike place from time to time. Today was the first time that I decided to stop in and see what was up. 
,,,,,"There was a giant selection to choose from. Literally, they have a taste for everyone. If you just want breakfast, they have bacon, egg, and cheese one. In the mood for sweets, they have several. Since it was my first time here, I opted to go with one of their best sellers. "
,,,,,"I grabbed me up a smoked salmon pate Piroshky. The Piroshky was big. Big enough for one meal for me. Perfect for breakfast. I wanted to buy more but after seeing the size, I knew that my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Once I got back to my room, I dove it. It was amazing. There is a slight sweetness to the dough which was a pleasant surprise. Once getting to the pate, it complimented the sweetness very well. The smoked salmon was not over powering. It was just a hint of smokiness. The pate was super tasty. I could put away three and make myself sick....they were that good "
,,,,,"I can't wait to go back. There is a curry one that I am dying to taste. If I had the time, I would slowly work my way through them all. "
,,,,,Inside was super small. They are practicing good social distancing right now. The crew was very warm and welcoming. It took a touch of time to order my Piroshky because it was my first time and I could decide. They didn't rush me and offered comments if I had any questions. 
,,,,,"10/10 would stop back in this spot. If you are in the area and looking for a nice snack to walk around with, this is the spot to stop. Perfect for hand held food."
,,,,,"Must-stop shop.  It's very affordable, and pretty tasty.  I didn't give it 5 stars just because I don't think it's the healthiest snack in the world.  I'd recommend the salmon, because it's just phenomenal!  And it kind of negates the unhealthiest aspect of the piroshkys!"
,,,,,OMG!!! You can smell this place as soon as you turn the corner if your headed to the original Starbucks store. please stop and enjoy the aroma coming from this place. I literally lined up for an apple cinnamon roll and walked out 38$ later and 3 bags full of goodies.i actually returned on all 3 days I was staying close by. The have seasonal stuff too so make and grab those because once they are gone they are GONE! I had these cherries and cream pastries that were seasonal and I even brought some back to California along with the apple cinnamon roll and poppy seed cinnamon rolls. If you do come be prepared to line up but don't worry there is someone that comes out and let's you know when things are running low and when they are gone for your convenience. They also have  a menu in line while you wait to see all the deliciousness they have. While you wait in line you can admire them making pastries in the window or as you walk by. Really not sure if they sale warm drinks since this place caught my eye or should I say nose on the way to the first Starbucks.
,,,,,"Thanks for the awesome review, Casey! We work hard to meet expectations like yours. Come back and see us soon. Cheers!"
,,,,,"I'm down for you Piroshky Piroshky. It's quick, it's cheap, it tastes good. "
,,,,,Pairing this with your Pike Place Chowder is a great tip if you don't already do this. I tried one of their popular piroshkys - smoked salmon pate. Delish! I don't know why I didn't choose to buy more? But you can't come to Seattle and not get this! 
,,,,,"For two of their best sellers, I spent about $14. Well worth it."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We randomly passed by this place while walking through Public Market and we were drawn to the smell! My friend told me that the last time she was in Seattle, she wanted to go in but the line wrapped around the door so she didn't get the chance to. Lucky for us, there was no one there when we passed by that late afternoon! "
,,,,,"There are so many items in the bakery at first it was a bit overwhelming! The service is extremely welcoming though. After talking for a bit I took the recommendation for the salmon pate roll, and it was amazing! "
,,,,,"If you have the time to stop by, highly recommended!"
,,,,,"While walking through the streets of Pike Place Market, I was intrigued by the line coming out of the Piroshky Piroshky bakery. My cousins were familiar with these hand made Russian delicacies, so I decided to try them out."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Like what a majority of everyone here experienced was the the long line, but it did move at an acceptable rate. As of what to order, the menu was very versatile from sweets to a quick and filling meal. With so much to eat, see, and do in the market place, I decided to go with a couple piroshkies so I can have more room in my stomach for more sampling. I had the following piroshkies:"
,,,,,"- Salmon pate (Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion)"
,,,,,"- Bacon, egg, & cheese"
,,,,,Both tasted very good! My favorite out of the two was the salmon pate. 
,,,,,A definite place to visit for freshly made and great tasting eats!
,,,,,"Recommended to us by a friend. My wife like the Berry Bedazzel. Bac, HB, E&C PIr was ok. Bought 3 Moscow Rolls. Threw them way. All 4 of us didn't like them. Not light and fluffy. Bland, pasty and nothing like custard. Skip this item. Mostly dough. Ingredients need to be good. Won't go here again. Kudos to fast line and friendly staff though. Not worth the hype."
,,,,,You know how they have these therapeutic bread making and baking videos online? This place will offer you a live version of it  Best time to go here is on Monday morning around 9 AM. It was almost empty when we went which meant extra time to chat with the bakers and getting to know about the pastries. We got their chives and cheddar roll and signature potato roll and both were out of the world!
,,,,,The employees are very friendly and give you great recommendations. The pastries are made in front of you and they keep getting sold out so everything is fresh. Do not miss this place during your visit to Pike's place market.
,,,,,"Great food! Finally I've found something new. Their bakery is awesome, I don't even know what can be compared to it. I would say it's a must try if you are in town. Best place to experience the taste of Russia, amazing sweet and hot pies."
,,,,,"Last time I came by, the long line turned me off even though the smells were quite tempting. This time we stopped by on a Sunday at 6:10pm and the line wasn't too long, and it moved quite fast. I am so glad we got the meat Piroshky! The beef & onion are the best ones so far. The salmon was pretty good too, but the beef & onion is a must. Flaky & buttery pastry and delicious & savory filling. Tried their sweet patties and I just think we'll just stick to the savory ones next time around."
,,,,,Awesome pastries. Great for cheap eats if you're in pike place market. Grab the patties to go and sit out on the steps overlooking the sound. A must try restaurant for any visitor in Seattle!
,,,,,Bacon egg potato didn't warrant the usual long waits. Lox one wasn't great either. Definitely worth a try if the wait isn't too long however.
,,,,,Little overpriced but very delicious. Great flavors to choose from. The seasonal flavors were good.
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky I love ya Piroshky.
,,,,,"I'm walking down Pike and I see people walking around with delicious looking piroshky's.  Where are they coming from?  Piroshky Prioshky, that's where."
,,,,,"But oh, this is sooo much more than a Piroshky shop, this is a bakery from heaven.  Is there anything in this carb fiesta that I don't like?  Uh, no.  I've tried most of their offerings and I haven't come across one that I wouldn't eat again - or 10 times."
,,,,,"This is a bakery that can become a habit, or maybe even an addiction.  Should there be a 12 step program for Piroshky Piroshky addicts?  Maybe."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"My first time trying Russian food! I must say, I thought it was so good. All I saw was carbs, and I knew this place would be the way to my heart. I ordered the bacon, cheese, eggs and hash brown, along with the apple cinnamon one. Omg so warm, soft and to die for! "
,,,,,"This place is located next to the first Starbucks. It's perfect, because you can grab yourself a danish, and head over to get a warm drink with it. Especially if it's cold out! That's exactly was we did. There's no place to sit, so you just grab and go. It reminded me of a donut shop. You choose what you want, pay and keep it pushing. Yummy spot!"
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky! This location is in the Pike Place Market and all the lists told my friends and I it was a must-try spot. I am a fan for sure, it was legit! "
,,,,,"So WTF is a Piroshky you may be asking? I asked this so figure it may be the question on others' minds, as well. It's a Russian puff pastry either fried or baked then filled with some kind of goodness. "
,,,,,"We had a couple of their tasty delights to try including the Apple Cinnamon Roll ($4.50). It's a classic, soft, sweet and scrumptious made with granny smith apples, cinnamon, honey & lemon. The star of the show for me was the Bacon, Hash Brown, Egg & Cheese Piroshky. Ingredients I love wrapped up in a fried carb blanket. Yes, please! It ran me about $7 and was well worth the cost. Breakfast in a bun!"
,,,,,"On this one, I have to agree with all the recommendations! Pop in while prowling Pike Place! There seems to always be a line but it moves fairly quickly and is worth a few minutes of your time."
,,,,,This is a Seattle classic! I would go early before the market's open to avoid lines. You can then grab a cup of coffee andstroll as vendors get set up.
,,,,,"There are many reasons why I like this place, they have so much bread. I'm a bread person, and I love my carbs. This was my first time trying Russian food, and they have so many good things on the menu I didn't know what to choose from. I ended up trying to Moscow roll, and it was so delicious. They greet you with a great greeting, and they treat you so well. "
,,,,,"My friends love this place also, and I will continue to keep coming here as long as I'm hungry. If you're in the area, if you want some delicious Russian food, I guarantee you'll love this spot."
,,,,,Definitely a Pike Place Market staple! The ham and cheese croissant thingy was just as delicious as I anticipated and the employees were friendly and even made recommendations on their personal favorites. Good food and good people for sure!
,,,,,"Don't be intimidated by the line from afar! The line may look long, but the good folks here were super quick and super friendly - not to mention the food was super good! Cheddar Garlic Roll goes really well with Pike Place Chowder!"
,,,,,"Although I was born and raised in Seattle (go Dawgs! Go Hawks!), I've never really made time to explore the touristy sites before moving to the Bay Area.  On our last Christmas Vacation, we played tourist at the famous Pike Place Market.  Right outside of this market, you'll a single line of people. This is for Piroshky Piroshky of course, the Russian puff-pastries with endless combinations of sweet and savory fillings!  "
,,,,,The line moves pretty fast - maybe 30 min.  Its cool the customers near the front of the line will pass down the menu showing pictures of their offerings with prices. Be sure to return the favor!
,,,,,"Being our first time, we ordered all sweet ones:"
,,,,,"* Cinnamon Cardamom Braid was my favorite, especially after heating it in a microwave for 30 sec.  Hot, chewy pastry with a nice balance of sweet and spicy."
,,,,,"* Marzipan Roll was also good.  Honey, Almond, Sugar - what's not to like?  It was good at room temperature but would probably be awesome warm."
,,,,,* Chocolate cream hazelnut roll was a bit too sweet for my liking. 
,,,,,"Definitely interested in coming back to sample their savory options.  They're pretty pricey at just under $5 each and with so many options, its not surprising that folks come back."
,,,,,"Omg yums, this place was soooo good. I got the salmon piroshky it was amazing. A plus was it just came out of the oven so it was super hot. It was around $8 for one, but it's so worth it that I went back for another one to try. "
,,,,,"The other one I got was the mushroom and potatoes. It was good, but hands down the salmon is my favorite. I was still thinking about it after I ate it. Must get when you are in Seattle!"
,,,,,"Long lines, but moves fast!"
,,,,,"My favorite was the salmon, but the original beef and onion was also really good (a little salty but not too bad). The almond one was underwhelming though."
,,,,,The Russian friend said that she would write this up to 3.5 but we can't so we had to rate it at 4. We bought bread at the afternoon and then ate it at 1 AM while preparing for a 3:30 AM flight to the southern border so that was an experience with the bread. She got the beef and onion and wish there was more diversity in the beef flavor. It was cooked well happy face. However it was a lot of bread for 1 AM so would not recommend eating at 1 AM before a flight so you can't bring it onto the flight so you do have to finish it at 1 AM.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This was good but not exactly what I was expecting. The smells, looks, and lines brought us there. We got one sweet and one savory item. I was expecting a more light and airy dough but was surprised with how dense it was. The hazelnut was okay but not great, once again pretty dense bread. The salmon had a decent flavor and great presentation. It was more of the look and presentation not jiving with the actual taste and texture."
,,,,,"Nothing Russian lol ! I'm Russian my self and this is a joke people! Wrong dough,wrong flavors ,just wrong... nothing Russian.. French guys up the street more French then this one Russian trust me!"
,,,,,I wanted to love this place because of the high ratings. The smell was so inviting and the staff is friendly. But the pastries to me were mediocre. 
,,,,,I ordered the... 
,,,,,- Chocolate Cream Hazelnut roll
,,,,,- Marzipan Roll 
,,,,,- Cinnamon Cardamon braid
,,,,,"- Vegetable Piroshky with spinach, egg, and cheese "
,,,,,"The pasties and piroshki were not fresh. It was a bit cold and it made me wonder how long ago the batch was made. I felt like I was eating harden dough. No sweetness or taste that popped out to me. I really wanted to try the meat piroshki with Ham, cheese and spinach version but they were out. "
,,,,,"P.S. I even tried to warm up the pastries in the microwave back at the hotel, but it did not help."
,,,,,"This place deserves huge praises for delicious Piroshkys and for amazing customer service! We drove up here for my son's birthday and he wanted to have something from here as a treat. When it was initially delivered, it wasn't there. What was amazing was that when we contacted the place to tell them, the owner volunteered to go pick them up herself and drop it off for us. The value of customer service is phenomenal! We will definitely be coming back everytime for this and their amazing selection of pastries. If you are in the area, please stop by and try their food. You will not be disappointed!!!"
,,,,,Thank you Olga!
,,,,,If in the Seattle area this is a must go to ! Order the salmon pastry and you will not be disappointed! Only negative is the line but I will tell you it is worth the wait :)
,,,,,Get in line when it first opens otherwise await is long.  Their bakery bread taste like pretzel bread for savory and sweet.
,,,,,I like 85 degrees bakery bread texture much better Overall.
,,,,,Their food was ok but I wouldn't wait in that long line 
,,,,,Out the bakeries I've tasted average tasting
,,,,,"Classic spot in the Market, whenever I venture down to tourist-central I'll wait in line for Piroshky Piroshky (and the line moves pretty fast). They always have an abundance of delicious Piroshky, and some monthly specials. I'm a sucker for their ham cheese & spinach. Each item will fill you up, but if you're really hungry you could try and finish two entire Piroshky."
,,,,,Great little spot to grab a snack. I enjoyed a variety of their Pirozhkis but the Marzipan took my tastebuds back to the USSR. A must grab at the Fish Market.
,,,,,"Their will be a line on the weekend unless you go in the morning morning. But the place moves quickly and efficiently for a small location. I did see another location while walking in Seattle, but this one is where everyone goes to at Pike Place Market. I had the beef and onion and it was amazing. Perfect amount of meat to bread ratio. Bread had a good crunch and the beef and onion complimented very well with each other. Service is super nice and helpful!"
,,,,,"TLDR; there's always a line at this location but there are multiple ones in the city if you don't want to wait in line. I highly recommend the smoked salmon pate but if you're unlucky like me, they'll sell out when you finally get the chance to order. "
,,,,,"The last time I visited Seattle, I came to Piroshky twice to get the Smoked Salmon Pate because of how good it was. So this was the only thing I really wanted to eat again during my most recent visit. The line was pretty long so half of our group got some Beecher's to share while the other half stayed in line to take all of our orders. "
,,,,,"Unfortunately, they ran out of the smoked salmon pate so I opted for the Beef and Cheese. Apparently it's their top selling so that seemed like a good choice. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a smoked salmon pate. I think I had my expectations set a little too high. I liked the crispy cheese baked on the top though. "
,,,,,"I also got to try the Bacon, Hash Brown, Egg and Cheese Piroshky. I really like the idea of this breakfast one but I think it could've been seasoned a bit more. Because of all the potatoes and the bread, it wasn't as salty as I'd like it to be. "
,,,,,"Even though I wasn't able to get the smoked salmon pate, I'd still give it 5 stars. This will always be a stop whenever I'm in Seattle again."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Wait time was only 15 - 20 minutes, not as bad as we thought it would be. It took us more time to find parking, surprisingly."
,,,,,"We ordered three smoked salmon pate rolls, a beef and cheese roll, a curry chicken roll, and a marzipan. I'd say the most delicious and memorable of the savory ones we tried would be the smoked salmon pate. Biting into it was an interesting experience because of the pate texture. It didn't taste overwhelmingly fishy and the bread to pate ratio was fair. I'd say it's worth $4.00 - $5.00 max, though."
,,,,,"The other rolls we tried weren't that special. Marzipan was good, but wasn't very different from almond paste pastries from other bakeries. The bread was crispy and all, but it wasn't anything to write home about. If anything, the beef and cheese roll and curry chicken roll would make for a filling meal on their own if you're trying to get your money's worth in Seattle. Outside of the smoked salmon pate, I don't recommend anything else from what I've tried."
,,,,,"Pretty decent spot to go to in Pike's place. I can't say that the Piroshkys were that good, but it's at least interesting and something new for me."
,,,,,We got the Salmon Piroshky and the Beef and Onion. Would recommend both. Very friendly staff who had a short but great conversation with us.  Perfect to stop and grab a quick breakfast before exploring Pike Place. Price wasn't bad either.
,,,,,"I waited to taste this for so long and I'm so happy I finally did. I love any type of bread that has filling in it. I got the salmon and cream cheese pate, I was first worried there would not be enough filling in the bread but there were was definitely enough. I really liked it as it was so warm and yummy. Can't wait to try the other fillings they have."
,,,,,Worth the wait? No.
,,,,,Worth naming it twice? Yes. Yes.
,,,,,Worth Yelp stars? Sure ... 4 seems about right.
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is one of the many popular tourist magnets at Pike Place Market. There's a line. At the end are small hand-held Russian-inspired pies. Whether you get veggie, meat, or sweet, you're in line to get a handful of these baked buns."
,,,,,My recommendations:
,,,,, * Smoked Salmon Pate
,,,,, * Cabbage & Onion
,,,,, * Beef & Onion
,,,,, * Potato & Mushroom
,,,,, * Marzipan Roll
,,,,, * Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll
,,,,, * Cherry White Chocolate Roll
,,,,, * Marionberry/Blueberry Vatrushka
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"There are now multiple Piroshky Piroshky locations around Seattle, but this is the one and only original ... worthy of 4 stars and, like New York, so good they named it twice."
,,,,,Piroshky = Small Pie 
,,,,,There's usually a long line at this bakery. I got lucky and was third in queue when I got there. I wasn't ready to order when it was my turn so I asked the lady behind the counter what the top sellers were and got what she recommended:
,,,,,All the pies had a perfect crust to filling ratio. Not too much crust and the filling was not just placed in the center. It went to the edges! We bought our piroshkys and took them home to eat the next day. Easy to reheat. Just pop in the oven for 5 min at 350 F and the crusts will be crispy and the insides are warm. The only one we couldn't heat up was the Vatrushka. Just left it out at room temp. 
,,,,,Beef and Cheese: Perfect balance of meat and cheese. Good flavor. Not greasy. 
,,,,,Smoked Salmon Pate: Delicate and nice smoky salmon flavor. 
,,,,,Marzipan Roll: Mmmmm!! Sweet and smooth almond flavor. 
,,,,,Blueberry Cream Cheese Vatrushka: Creamy and good but not my favorite. The family liked it as well.
,,,,,Today I I drove out from PDX to Seattle. We stopped by to get 2 stuffed pastries because they're delish but lowkey disappointed because I ordered one with just beef and one with  ham & cheese. I didn't realize until I drove back home 3 hours away and realized they messed up my order. I mean beef is good but I was really looking foward to the ham and chese one. Funny thing is that there was no line haha oh well ... theyre good tho just make sure you check your stuff before you leave!
,,,,,"The wait was quick, staff was friendly and efficient, food was fresh, delicious, flavorful, and unlike pastries I've had before. What more do I need to say?"
,,,,,"Definitely a must try when you're in Seattle. Whenever I'm at Pike Place Market, if I get to skip the long line, I'll for sure grab a bite from Piroshky Piroshky. It's authentic and delicious. My favorite ones are the chicken curry and rice, beef and onion Piroshky."
,,,,,"Delicious! Quick and easy spot to grab a bite. Many varieties to choose from: meaty, vegetarian and vegan choices."
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"The selection of piroshky are extensive for such a small place and none of them disappoint on flavor.  The beef and onion is their signature for a reason- it's delish!  They've got service down to an art and you can get in pretty quickly, even if there's a line.  The only drawback on our last visit was the bottom of the bag wasn't glued properly and our curry chicken prioshky bit the dust.  After I showed them the bottom of the bag, they replaced it and we were happy."
,,,,,"Okay, I know it's touristy given the location, but man, these piroshkys are outstanding! I stop buy and purchase and eat too many every time I take out of town visitors to Pikes Market. So many shapes and flavors. Sauerkraut and caraway. Veggie piroshky. Salmon piroshky. Ham and cheese piroshky. It's the dough. You could wrap an old sneaker in that stuff and bake it and it'd be delicious."
,,,,,In a long row of food outlets this is the one you must not miss.
,,,,,Absolutely delicious and great customer service despite how busy it gets. You can't go wrong with any of the options.
,,,,,The REAL reason why I wanted to celebrate my birthday in Seattle. SMOKED SALMON PATE! 
,,,,,"Always a huge line but it goes pretty fast. Wokers there are all awesome. I asked for 12 smoked salmon pate 30 mins before closing and the guy was so sweet. He said ""make sure you get in line and we will hold it for you."" Not only did he save us 12 plus 3 more but they were freshly baked and out of the oven in 10 mins. The smell coming out of this small store is heavenly. "
,,,,,My most favorite is the smoked salmon pate but I also liked the meat n cheese. 
,,,,,My boss even made me bring her some back home. Pop it in the oven or toaster for a few mins and tastes just as fresh.
,,,,,"Hi there Nicky,"
,,,,,Happy belated birthday! We're so happy you chose to visit us on your special day! We are big fans of the Smoked Salmon Pate too. We can't wait to see you again!
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,This place makes crazy good savory and sweet treats. One of my favorites was the curry chicken. Go early to beat the lines!
,,,,,"My friends and I just really wanted a snack. We saw the high reviews and nice photos so we came here from Rachels ginger beer. The line was snaking out the door, but the line seemed to go fast. The shop is really small, with almost no room other than the line. I wish there was a menu sign or something because we had no idea what was there/what to get. "
,,,,,"We came to the front and quickly ordered the beef and cheese and the chocolate hazelnut creme (nutella). They were super hot when they gave them to us. We moved outside to eat. The beef and cheese was amazing! It reminded me of a chinese bao. We weren't huge fans of the nutella one. It was good, but we probably wouldn't order it again. "
,,,,,Only until after we finished eating we noticed the outside wall had pictures and showed which ones were popular. The bread tasted really good with the ginger beer too. I would definitely recommend to check this place out if youre visiting.
,,,,,"Get there early if you want to get in and out. Beef and cheese for savory and rhubarb for sweet, best in my opinion, yum!"
,,,,,It's always nice to come across a place that sells piroshky. Their salmon and beef piroshkys are delicious. I wish they made their potato piroshkys with mashed potatoes.
,,,,,"Expect long queues at peak hours, but nothing really compares to the freshly made piroshki here. My favourite are the salmon pate and the sausage ones but you can't really go wrong here. Grab and go is pretty quick too."
,,,,,"Oh my!  No wonder there was a very long line one Sunday outside this store.  We did not queue up then, but we went back to the market one day during the week and with a shorter line, I was able to indulge myself.  I like trying new dishes and I must say the 2 I bought were heavenly!  Light fluffy pastry with tasty fillings and many filling choices, some of which sell out early.  A very different and delightful choice.  No gluten free options sadly."

,,,,,"Pike Place Market is definitely a gem in Seattle to find good places to around the wharf. I heard from a lot of people that Piroshky Piroshky is definitely a must try if you want some good Russian pastries. My friends and I (being the fatty food loving tourists we are) wanted to try literally everything in the morning, and this place was the first to start our 10-course meal of the day! "
,,,,,"They have so many pastries, but one that literally stood out the most was for sure the famous Smoke Salmon Piroshky. We got it in the morning around 8:00am and it was fresh and warm. There's practically no one in line either at that time. We also got the Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll and the Sauerkraut Piroshky but they were just okay in my opinion."
,,,,,The one thing I was scared of when getting this was if it was mostly bread and barely any salmon. BUT I WAS WRONG. They give such a generous amount and the filling for this pastry specifically was so savory. I wish I ordered a bunch before my flight back to California but I ended up not doing it... and I was sad. But hey next time for sure! I highly recommend this place!
,,,,,"We got the Bacon Hashbrown Egg & Cheese Piroshky along with one of their bestsellers, the Potato & Cheese Piroshky. The don't skimp on the filling. Each bite you get a good portion of the filling along with the bread. The bread itself is slightly sweet which adds to the rich & heavy filling. "
,,,,,My little cousin enjoyed the Bacon Hashbrown Egg & Cheese a lot. I think the combination of flavors is ideal for satisfying a little kid's palate. The Potato & Cheese Piroshky is very rich. I'd recommend grabbing something to drink with these as they tend to be slightly dry. 
,,,,,"There is always a line outside but the line is very quick. It usually takes less than 10min to get to order, so don't be intimidated by the line outside the door."
,,,,,"Hello Yegee,"
,,,,,Thank you for leaving the positive review! We are happy to hear that you enjoyed our piroshkies. We can't wait to see you next time you're in town!
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,I'm back three years later to get the smoked salmon pate that ran out the last time I was here.
,,,,,"I asked for it heated. The smoked salmon pate was soft, fluffy, slightly smoky, flavorful, and stuffed generously inside a cute fish-shaped bread. The size of the bread looks filling but the bread is much lighter than it looks. I definitely had enough room to eat more around Pike Market."
,,,,,"Cabbage and onion - Savory, delicious."
,,,,,"Since I spent more than $50, I received a complimentary bag."
,,,,,The beef and cheese piroshky was excellent. It was just all meat in the center with very little bread surrounding this giant flattened Russian meat bun. It reminded me of what a Russian burger would be like but the contents were sealed off by bread. 
,,,,,"They ran out of the salmon pate bread. Based on two employees' recommendations, I went with the chicken, mushroom, and rice piroshky . I've had Asian versions of rice being stuffed into buns and didn't like that. You can hardly notice the rice. The entire inside was so gooey and full of flavor. "
,,,,,The rhubarb pie was as gooey as you'd expect a fruit jelly pastry to be. It tastes even better when heat it up. It brings out the flavors.
,,,,,"I don't know how I managed to finish all of this but I don't regret any of it. I've been using ""best I've ever had"" in so many of my Seattle posts, but I know nothing about Russian diet, so this really is the best Russian pastry I've ever had."
,,,,,One of our favorite places to visit at the pike place market. The salmon Piroshky is not to be missed.
,,,,,"NOT WORTH THE HYPE. Really with all those lines. There is one good piroshky, the smoked salmon pate. That too the dough was meh. It seems like they make it very ahead of time and it has been sitting around for along time. It's not that tasty. There's no wow in this. Meh tasting pastry hype."
,,,,,I haven't been here in years. The line is always too long. If it's as good as my memory it's worth the wait.
,,,,,"I wanted to see what the hype was all about, so I came here near closing time to avoid the lines. Considering that this is in Pike Place, it's definitely for tourists. I had the beef + cheese piroshky and it was yummy but nothing *that* special. The bread part was a great texture. I also got a cinnamon cardamon braid for later, and it had just the right amount of sweetness. It was quite a hefty pastry, so was definitely a good value. "
,,,,,Service was quick and the staff was smiley.
,,,,,"Long lines, tourist trappy. Thanks, Anthony Bourdain for bringing this dough stand to everyone's attention."
,,,,,Great service and so worth the time finding a parking spot in downtown Seattle! The beef and cheese is hands down my favorite!
,,,,,Freaking delicious. Worth waiting in line. Highly recommend the beef and onion and also the smoked salmon  It's a must when going to Pike Place.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,We stood in line for a good 10 minutes on a Monday morning just to out of plain curiosity as to why other people were. I for one did not know what a piroshky was or looks like. I know the term and there ends my knowledge. I didn't even know if this was something people eat at 10 am in the morning. 
,,,,,"Once we got into this little hole in the wall, I decided to rely entirely on the recommendation of the staff. I was suggested the chicken curry piroshky, spinach egg and cheese, cheddar cheese roll, marzipan roll and the sweet one (I forget its name, as I did not try that one myself). We were a group of 5 and went ahead and ordered them all to get a bite of each. Cost us about $30-ish for 5 piroshkys. Not too bad I assume, for a delicacy. They had a lot of sweet options, such as cinnamon braided rolls, golden baked apple, and a couple of other interesting options. As I have been off of sugar for the last 2 months, I did not try those. "
,,,,,My favorite was the Chicken curry piroshky - I loved how they had delicious chicken rice in the slightly sweet roll. I went back for another even before I had the chance to try the other ones. The crispness and the chicken rice was a perfect combination. It was great to see how fresh they were. Wasn't a fan of the spinach egg and cheese though. The others were quite interesting.
,,,,,"Overall, this would be one of the places I would go back to when I visit Seattle again"
,,,,,Was looking forward to this and went away feeling disappointed. I saw the guy making it from the window and they should really be wearing gloves. Tried the salmon and egg bacon potato ones. Nothing interesting or worth trying. To top it of these are $7 each. Piroshkys in LA are no more than $2. Disappointing
,,,,,"The last time I had the most delicious pierogi pastry at P2 was over twenty years ago. I recall a couple of visits back, I was overwhelmed viewing the line of folks waiting their turn to order up the coveted pastry. "
,,,,,"This time though, a long line was not going to get in between me and my spinach & onion pierogi. The line queue was surprisingly swift; run by a well organized queue conductor. Twenty years later, the flakey pastry was held tightly in my right hand. It quickly disappeared into my mouth with total delight. Ahhh!  "
,,,,,"Don't miss out!  For me, as it goes for pierogi pastries, this is as good as it gets. P2 is a Pike Place Market icon. "
,,,,,Truly a FIVE star experience.
,,,,,Amazing Russian bread! Pretty interesting texture. It's hard but also soft. I like the taste but I wouldn't give it a 5 star. Something is missing on the taste that will gives that umph...I think if they can serve the bread hotter or has the spicy taste...then it will be perfect!
,,,,,This place is very popular at Pike's place and there's tons of positive reviews. There was always a line out the door and one day I found the line to be a little bit shorter so I hopped in. I wasn't sure what to order and didn't see a menu till I got close to the counter. I ended up with the beef and cheese that I had for breakfast I was unsure what to get. I did enjoy eating it while walking and shopping around Pike's place.
,,,,,My only complaint is that they should have a menu to look at before coming to the counter along with prices. I'm sure the location makes the prices a bit high too. I didn't find my pastries to be amazing it was just okay. Maybe I need to try more items on the menu. I would visit again to try other items and find the perfect bite.
,,,,,Worth a 20-minute wait in line. We came back twice. Everything comes right out of the oven. We ordered the meat+onion and potato+mushroom. Yummy!
,,,,,Great little spot to grab a pastry in the morning before walking around Pike Place Market!
,,,,,"I got the poppy seed cinnamon roll, mom got the cinnamon cardamon braid, and dad got the apple cinnamon roll. They all were fresh and soft which always makes me happy. Nothing worst than a hard pastry. The light glaze of honey was pretty good and seemed to be a winner across the board with everyone liking it, but because the glaze was so light, the pastry itself was almost dry. It did provided a subtle sweetness without being too sweet though! The overall flavor seemed a bit subdued - maybe that's just because of the minimalist ingredients used - but as mom said and I agree, ""the flavor didn't pop."" Either way I'd loved to come back and try one of their meat filled pastries and see how I like those! Like any quality food spot at Pike Place, if you want to avoid lines, show up early!"
,,,,,Guilty. Pleasure.
,,,,,"Their smoked salmon piroshky is heaven on earth. But they have a great selection for both meat and non meat eaters alike. Also they have a great ordering service where you can take away a few. My experience is that a Piroshky from here properly stored can last for at least two days, if you don't eat it first. Love their rewards system as well!"
,,,,,"A great option for a quick bite (or many bites, if you want to get a few piroshky...). Though maybe not so quick if you hit it when there is a long line. The Beef & Cheese is super good, as is the Cinnamon Cardamom Braid."
,,,,,When in downtown Seattle I heard you have to try out this Russian bakery which is exactly what I did. I visited the on at Pike Place around 9 in the morning and there was a line. The line however moved quite quickly. I didn't know what to expect nor did I feel I had enough time to look over the items due to the speed of the staff ringing people up so I settled on what looked filling and delicious. 
,,,,,"The bacon, cheese hash looked filling and soft but tasted even better. The bread was slightly sweet, soft and airy and flowed great with the rest of the bacon and hash. I wish I would have gotten more items because it was soo good and tasted like it was made with love. "
,,,,,There is no place to sit inside so make your way to the park or pier area to sit and enjoy. 
,,,,,I would definitely come back to try out some of their other items.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We had to try this spot, because I have passed it so many times before. I have heard of the legendary crust of their pastry, so I picked up one savory and one sweet. The savory was the ham, spinach and cheese. The sweet was their apple cinnamon. "
,,,,,"The crust is amazing!!! No it really lived up to the hype! The filling takes you to another world! I loved, loved, loved it! You learn that each of these vendors are bringing their craft to the market and it's a skill that has been passed down from generation to generation. I tasted the legacy and it was something that I will come back and wait in a line for! Cheers to all who try it. Do not just buy one. You will regret it. Get a savory... or two and don't forget the sweet."
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky should definitely be on your list when you're visiting Seattle. At first I was bit skeptical because it didn't look THAT great on yelp in my opinion. I came here on Sunday with a very short line that moved very quickly so do not be discouraged if you see a line. The piroshky's looked wayyyy better in person and smelled amazing. I ended up ordering the salmon, beef and cheese, potato and cheese, pumpkin toffee, marzipan roll and chocolate cream hazelnut. They were all very delicious except I didn't care too much for the marzipan roll since I'm not too fond of almond. The bread texture is definitely different from the typical breads you eat like baguettes or sandwiches. The piroshky is so soft and flavorful. I was hooked after the first bite. I definitely over ordered but I brought the rest back home to the bay area and were still good after warming them up in the oven! The service is also super quick and friendly here. I can't wait to come back when I visit Seattle!"
,,,,,"I've walked past Piroshky Piroshky so many times, it's almost criminal that I haven't stopped in yet. The lines were always a huge deterrent, and thus I'd take my food adventures elsewhere. But last late yesterday afternoon I found myself in the area a few hours before closing, and the line was only 4-5 people deep."
,,,,,"I went with the ever popular beef and cheese, and I really enjoyed the weight of it (made the $7-ish price worth it). I also liked how it was easy to hold as I made my way to the lookout area."
,,,,,"This was my first time having a piroshky, and while tasty I wasn't completely wow'd. Perhaps it was because it was a luke warm, and not freshly made? I'll certainly come back in the morning and try one of the fresher ones."
,,,,,"Definitely come to the store in the late afternoon if you don't want to wait over 30 minutes, I was in and out within 5 minutes. "
,,,,,"They do take credit cards, even if you're only getting one item (at least I didn't see a sign stating otherwise)."
,,,,,"Hello Caroline,"
,,,,,"Thanks for the kind words. We're sorry to hear that you had a lukewarm Piroshky, we know that can be super disappointing. Please email us at "
,,,,,", we would love to try to make this up to you the next time you are in Seattle."
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,"We came here to grab a few items to start off the day.  There was no line when we came here but we just missed the morning rush.  They had a lot of good piroshky here and just too many to decide on if it was your first time here.  We ordered a few different things and we were on our way.  There was no seating around that I could remember, but it was fine as we sat down somewhere close by.  The piroshky we ordered all tasted good to me.  I would come here the next time I visit Seattle to order other items on the menu.  Piroshky Piroshky was good and I would recommend it if you're in the area!"
,,,,,"This is always my favorite place in Seattle. I have been here for 8 years now. Everything here are good but my favorite is the salmon pate. It has the fish shape, very cute. It is creamy and tasty. There are lines here most of the time but I dont mind, its in Pike place so yeah obviously. I highly recommend this place if you visit Seattle."
,,,,,"I love piroshky! My best advice: if you can, get the meat piroshky! They turned out to be much much better than vegetarian only ones."
,,,,,I am giving it 4 stars be cause I def think it is overpriced. $5-6 at least for a regular piroshky for such a tiny place is quite a lot. Double the amount and you get a regular sized pizza .
,,,,,"Hi Malika,"
,,,,,"Thank you for the kind words! We're sorry to hear that you feel we are overpriced, but unfortunately operating a business in the most popular tourist destination in Seattle comes at the cost to small family owned operations. We hope that doesn't deter you from visiting us again."
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,"Never been to a Russian bakery before, so figured I should give this place a try! Got the salmon pate, beef & onion, apple cinnamon roll, and cinnamon cardamon breads. Salmon pate was interesting...not bad...just not something I've tried before. Beef & onion tasted pretty good. Cinnamon cardamon was a little plain, I wish it had a little more juice or something. But the apple cinnamon was really good. "
,,,,,Would definitely recommend stopping by here to try it out!
,,,,,"Texas has Kolache's at Czech Stop, Chicago has Pierogis at Pierogi Heaven, and I'm a firm believer that the Seattle dog needs to step aside, because the pastries at Piroshky Piroshky should be the flagship dish of the city. The hype is real. "
,,,,,Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
,,,,,"Yes, the lines at Piroshky Piroshky can be long - very very long, so plan accordingly. I rolled in at about 10AM on a beautiful Saturday morning in the Summer and only ended up waiting about twenty minutes, which seemed a miracle based on some of the stories I had heard. Once you're in things move quickly, and before I knew it I had a sweet cinnamon coffee pastry in one hand and a savory beef and cheese in the other hand. Star. "
,,,,,Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
,,,,,"$6.85 seemed a bit steep initially for my Beef and Cheese Pastry, but given the size of this it really wasn't an unreasonable price point. Star. "
,,,,,Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
,,,,,"Sweet or savory, the pastries at Piroshky Piroshky are absolutely marvelous. For starters the bread is absolutely out of this world, and has a fluffy but buttery consistency that reminded me of revamped Hawaiian sweet rolls. Fantastic. To elevate things even further, the beef and cheese were excellent, and the end result was essentially a massive kolache. Two Stars. "
,,,,,Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?
,,,,,This is a Seattle must visit. Star.
,,,,,I'd never been to a Russian bakery and it was worth it. It went by it several times and there was always a line that went out the door and along the sidewalk. I returned about a half hour before closing and only had to wait about five minutes.
,,,,,"The staff was very friendly and recommended the salmon, which they said is one of their most popular. It seemed a little weird to have a salmon paste baked into a mildly sweet bread, but it worked and was surprisingly good."
,,,,,"I also tried the mushroom, which was decent but not great. I really liked the apple and cinnamon especially with the large apple slices in it."
,,,,,It's across from the Fish Market and by an alley. A bit divey looking but clean.
,,,,,"Firstly I really applaud the staff for being so efficient and quick with the long queue of people outside. It's worth the wait, so just go for it. We got the apple cinnamon roll and poppy seed cinnamon roll. The Apple roll just melted in my mouth and it has generous apple fillings. I felt it had little heavy dough but still it tasted SO good. Poppy seed cinnamon roll is less sweet but tasted great nonetheless. Wanna try their savory items next."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,4.5 STARs.
,,,,,"Got so many recommendations to visit this place - a ""must"".  Glad we did made the small effort to visit."
,,,,,"Located pretty much across from Pike Place Market, we were wandering around this area later in the evening (keep in mind the market and most of the stores around it close by 6-8pm).  We got here about 15 minutes before closing time (i think they close 7 or 7:30pm) and everything was 50% OFF!!   Surprisingly, there was plenty of selection for us.  "
,,,,,"It's a TINY place - we were warned that lineups go around the block, but as it was near closing, there was literally only 2 people ahead of us.  Which was good b/c there are only 2-3 seats at a tiny makeshift table/bar.  Basically take your stuff and wander around the area."
,,,,,"We ordered what was recommended to us, and for what they are known for - the smoked salmon pate.  You are in Seattle so you know you getting some fresh salmon!  The crust (fish shaped) so flaky and delectable, the salmon just flavourful (like fresh fish should taste) was lovely.  So grateful that at the end of the day, they still had some (they make they items throughout the day in order to keep up with demand)."
,,,,,"Do yourself a favour, come here, closer to closing time, and get the salmon pate - you won't be disappointed!"
,,,,,"Be sure you are in the right line because this place is really close to the OG starbucks line and they both extend super long. If you want to kill a lot of time, wait in one line then the other line."
,,,,,"This place felt super fast paced. I never had Russian pastries before so I didn't know what to expect. We got Salmon Pate, Bacon Potato Hash, Beef and Onion and it was all pretty good."
,,,,,"It is all about the experience. First you stand in line and someone hands you a menu. I have heard the savory pastries are better so pick those, but don't think too too hard because when you get to the front, they may not even have what you are looking for. We wanted two that they just did not have and on the spot we had to pick other ones. I don't think you can really go wrong, but be sure to have a few in mind."
,,,,,"The place is TINY and it feels like a walking drive through. You order, pay, they give you a bag over a really tall counter, and you leave through the exit, but pastries are good and it feels good to be rewarded with pastries when you're done waiting."
,,,,,"For a while now, I've heard rave reviews about Piroshky Piroshky. So when I entered Pike Place Market and saw the huge line of people being delegated by a Piroshky Piroshky staff member, I bit my lip and got in line."
,,,,,"The good: Piroshky Piroshky is fairly inexpensive. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon piroshky, which was $4. It was big enough that I could have shared it with a friend, which would have brought the cost down further. There is also a lot of variety, including special seasonal flavors. "
,,,,,"The bad: Honestly, I was pretty disappointed about the quality of the pastry I received. I didn't expect it to have come right out of the oven, but I was expecting it to be fairly fresh. After all, through the front windows, you can see staff members cutting and preparing dough. When I tried my pastry, it tasted as if it had been made yesterday. Still good, but not particularly fresh. The long line and lack of seating were expected, but also contributed to a negative experience for me."
,,,,,"Came here hyped to try the beef and cheese, but it was a disappointment. Maybe a bad day, idk but the meat was undercooked. Being middle eastern we take pride in our piroshkys and it was very subpar. If you're middle eastern skip the beef and get sweets."
,,,,,"The Chocolate Cream Hazelnut was heavenly, reminding me of very happy childhood memories somehow.  I wish I had ordered more when food was delivered to Washington, D.C. on a rare visit from this Seattle bakery.  My husband especially loved the salmon pate, the apple cinnamon, and cheddar garlic.  We both liked the Chipolte vegan but found that it was a bit too spicy for us to fully enjoy.  The mushroom potato vegan one was good but could not compare to the amazing chocolate one"
,,,,,"We hope that this bakery will return to D.C. very soon and that we will be ale to order a lot of chocolate hazelnut, salmon pate, apple cinnamon, and try a few new ones like cinnamon cardamon bread. Also we missed the poppy seed apple cinnamon treats we used to get there.  "
,,,,,"We hadn't been able to get to Pike's Market to visit here for years, and we have missed it.  In Seattle, the way to get a conversation going was to ask what was the person's favorite from this bakery.  A lot of people loved the beef and cheese, the salmon pate, or apple cinnamon.  It got interesting to hear what people loved and why.  I didn't get to try the coffee cinnamon roll and we probably should have ordered that while we could.  I love the bakery offering more for vegans and hope for some less spicy options.  And yes, I really would have loved more chocolate cream hazelnuts!  I can see why these are sold out so early each day, according to reviews.  "
,,,,,"Please come back to D.C. soon so that we can enjoy these treats again!  I usually don't allow myself to have certain treats but I am so glad I did this time, especially the chocolate hazelnut."
,,,,,"My husband loved the salmon pate piroshki so much that he bought another the following day.  The apple cinnamon roll was also a favorite for him.  We tried at least 6-8 different kinds in total, including the salmon, smoked mozzarella, mushroom potato, mushroom celery, poppy  seed, and apple cinnamon.  The salmon and smoked mozzarella were the two favorites for savory piroshkies."
,,,,,"Be prepared for long lines, even in the driving rain.  There was someone to guide us through the lines, ensuring that menus got passed back, that we knew what we wanted to order before we got to the counter.   Apparently the beef and cheese is a real favorite these days.  My husband didn't try that one, but he did like the salmon one enough that he had to get another."
,,,,,"This place is definitely a Seattle legend. There is Starbucks next door, also with long lines, and Le Panier with amazing French croissants and other goodies frees out of the oven."
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky! This was actually my friends and I's FIRST stop in Seattle. We were hungry and we looked at my Seattle ""to do"" list and bam, there it was. Right in front of our eyes. We waited in the line outside with our luggage because we came straight from the airport. The line did go pretty quickly. "
,,,,,"Do you know what a piroshky is? If not, compare it to a pierogi or a kolachi. Basically bread with stuff .. stuffed inside lol. Carb heaven I must say. Everything has bread with it. Therefore, if you cannot eat carbs or it's a weakness for you, stay away lol. "
,,,,,"I ended up getting the Smoked Salmon Pate. Giving the traditional Piroshky a local spin, this bestseller is a delicious blend of Smoked Salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion. I really loved it. It was nice and warm and the smoked salmon was flavorful."
,,,,,"Then during a food tour, I had the Smoked Salmon Pate and then an Apple Cinnamon Roll. This includes slices of Granny Smith Apples dusted with Cinnamon, rolled into dough and finished with a glaze of honey and lemon. It is their bestselling sweet creation. It was really good."
,,,,,"The morning we had to run to the airport, we ended up coming back. I had the Spinach, Egg, and Cheese. It contained Spinach tossed with Parmesan then baked with egg. This squared pied is topped of a sprinkle of Columbia Valley Sharp Cheddar. "
,,,,,"Overall, it was a great experience. A little of the expensive side for a pastry. However, it's a ""must go"" for Seattle! "
,,,,,[Review 72 for 2019. Review 514 overall]
,,,,,"Was able to grab some piroshky's this weekend in Woodinville at the food truck by the wineries. Let me just say YUM! We had the jalapeño sausage, the potato and mushroom and the beef. All were so good. The beef was a little greasy on the outside, but the dough was flaky and soft, the meat was flavorful and rich. The jalapeño was good, not too spicy at all, added mustard and it was great! The potato mushroom was very good with soft potato and good mushroom flavor. We will definitely go here again!"
,,,,,"We came later of the day but there was still a line. We got the pastries in about 15min, but totally worth it. I loved the salmon bread. I'd like to try the potato/mushroom too but they went out of them :("
,,,,,"They don't make them fresh, I got a dry cold salmon pate and can't understand the hype."
,,,,,I got the beef onion as the worker recommended me and it was so good. The pastry is so crunchy.

,,,,,The lines to get your piroshky's are long but worth it.  Sublime goodness to go.  Lovely staff and simple but profoundly delicious food.  If you're in the Pike Place Market and want delicious to-go Lu ch  don't miss this gem.
,,,,,"This place is wildly popular in Seattle. So popular in fact that they need a line leader to direct the line that forms outside and into the store. If this deters you, come later in they afternoon when the line isn't so long to grab one of their treats. "
,,,,,"The store smells heavenly. I found myself just standing outside, not even on line, because it smelled so good. It's one of the best smelling stores I've ever been to. You can also watch the bakers assemble which is cool to see. The price per item is a little high but the authenticity wins here."
,,,,,I have loved the way this business flexed & changed during COVID.  They also have partnered with other PPM businesses to help them out.  We will be lifelong supporters of Piroshky Piroshky!
,,,,,Thank you Nicole - we are trying and keep on pushing!  Thank you for your support - we wouldn't have done it without our great customers !
,,,,,"I hate to give such a famous place a 3/5 but we just were not blown away. We got the salmon, the potato/cheese, and the chicken curry based off other reviews. Everything was OKAY but nothing spectacular at all. Maybe the basic-ness of it is part of the attraction but I just did not get what the lines were for especially because everything is already made you just basically grab and go! The salmon was good, imagine a smoked salmon cream cheese dip calzone. The chicken curry was very strong in flavor which was nice but it didn't seem to have the right ratio of ingredients- very mushy. And the potato/cheese was quite dry. The other thing I was upset about is even though the salmon was under the 'heat light' it was very room temp at best. Maybe it would have been better if it was hot? Or cold? I don't know. Either way nothing was bad at alllll and everything tasted fine but nothing I would crave or need to try again."
,,,,,A must have when you stop by Pike's Market Place!
,,,,,"First learned of this place on the food network, and I am soooo glad I made note of this place so that I could make it a point to stop here while visiting Seattle"
,,,,,"LOCATION: This place is located in Pikes Market. Don't get intimidated by the long line, the line moves fairly quick. Choose, bag, pay and devour."
,,,,,"PARKING: so, I came here as a tourist.... I'm not familiar with the parking. My dad dropped us off near the entrance of Pikes Market then walked over from wherever he parked. I'm sure there are parking garages nearby.... otherwise, make use of them legs and walk over."
,,,,,"FOOD:  ok so this is a Russian pastry shop... but don't stick to the sweet pastries. In my opinion, the tasty ones are the meat pastries. Like the BEEF & ONION, CHICKEN CURRY RICE, and BEEF CHEESE SPINACH. My favorite was the beef and onion. I forgot to take photos of them because we ate them as we walked around."
,,,,,"SERVICE:  As I mentioned earlier, they have lines that form outside of their shop. It moves quick... so to keep things going, have an idea of what you want. Or just get one of each! They are nice but busy, so don't expect them to strike up a conversation with you. :)"
,,,,,"My favorite thing about these Russian pastries is how delicious their dough is... and how well it goes with the beef and onion or whatever they put inside. If you can't trust these Yelper reviews, trust the long line outside of their shop!"
,,,,,Of course we had to visit this classic when we landed in Seattle.
,,,,,There was a pretty decent sized line but what do you expect for a Friday afternoon? We got to the front where the smell got even better and ordered a beef and cheese and a cinnamon braid.
,,,,,Both were solid the beef and cheese were well beefy and cheesy they didn't skimp on fillings. The cinnamon braid was good and not too sweet so a perfect compliment.
,,,,,I hope that when I come back I can try everything in the case.
,,,,,Wow. Definitely go here!!! The line moves fast and it's 1000% worth it. Bought the potato & cheese and apple cinnamon roll. Would buy again in a heartbeat.
,,,,,"Small, unassuming place that turned out to be a delight. We saw a long line outside and ended up trying it out - it has subtly flavored, well baked pastries and other items. Very unique and eclectic."
,,,,,Always make it a point to get my breakfast here whenever I'm in Seattle. All the piroshkies are baked onsite. They were still warm when we got ours. My personal rating starting w the best tasting one :
,,,,,"1. Beef and onions, "
,,,,,"2. Bacon, hash browns and egg "
,,,,,"3. Ham, cheese and spinach"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"tl;dr positioned right next to the original Starbucks, this Pike Place hole-in-the-wall brings sweet and savory Russian pastries to tourists and locals alike"
,,,,,"While every shop at Pike Place feels touristy, Piroshky Piroshky can garner enormous lines. This closet-sized bakery can barely fit the small bar counter pressed against its window, much less a swarm of hungry patrons. The queue frequently stretches all the way around the block, and waiting customers are handed menus ahead of time to expedite the ordering process. Once one finally reaches the front, the friendliest bouncer ever (i.e. one of the family members running the shop) allows people in, two at a time, to the cramped interior. Pastries are separated between a display of sweet and savory, and a bustling workforce buzzes int he background ensuring that the supply meets the voracious demand."
,,,,,"With the cool, drizzly weather, the line during our visit was only 5 minutes. Before even entering the closet-sized room, I was entranced by the buttery aromas wafting from the door. We decided on a Beef and Onion Piroshky, a Salmon Pate Piroshky, and Marzipan Piroshky. On each, the warm crust had a heavenly flakiness. The beef had the rustiness of pot pie rolled into a small bite. On the other hand, the salmon erred on the doughy side, but the bites with filling had a heavy, deeply-flavored puree. Finally, the marzipan dialed up a rich sweetness and didn't hold back on the almond notes. "
,,,,,"At around $20 for the assortment, each piroshky carries a slight Pike Place premium. But there's a reason for the lines -- the freshly-baked pastries are something that I will dream about all the way from Philly."
,,,,,"Really good Piroshky!  Third time here and I didn't recall they hired Seinfeld's Soup Nazi's wife.  Try to stand in line and was guided to a different line, then told my kids were standing a foot on the sidewalk, so I was told twice to be sure they literally stood behind an imaginary line.  She's the lady that will charge you for BBQ sauce at McDonalds.  "
,,,,,"When it was time to order, the people inside were legit!  Ordered the food and some good small talk on events going on for the day.  But the Piroshky!  The Beef and Onion was the favorite for us, with the Beef and Cheese at a close second.  Also tried the chocolate hazelnut, but it wasn't our favorite.  Go for savory and it will be good."

,,,,,"Thank you for the positive review! We're so happy to hear our team was ""legit"" -- we will make sure they know! Thank you for visiting us, we appreciate you!"

,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a small bakery at Pike Place market that sells Russian pastries. There was a long line, but it went pretty quickly, maybe about 5-10 minutes. When we got inside, the bakery itself was very small, cramped, and very crowded. We ordered the smoked salmon pate piroshky, the beef and cheese piroshky, and the chocolate cream hazelnut roll piroshky. The piroshkies were large in size, very doughy, and tasted not bad. "
,,,,,"I preferred the beef and cheese piroshky over the salmon pate. Although I do like salmon, I'm not a huge pate person and the salmon piroshky had a lot of pate texture inside the bread. As for the beef and cheese, the flavor was good, but it was also very bready and the beef wasn't abundant. The chocolate roll was a good dessert, but I wasn't blown away."
,,,,,"Overall, Piroshky Piroshky is a good Russian pastry shop where you can get a very filling, savory or sweet, bite to eat. The savory piroshkies were $6.85 and the sweet pastries were about $5-6. We grabbed a few to eat on the plane and they were not a bad choice."
,,,,,"Came here two days in a row because we enjoyed it that much!! Right outside of pike place market. There is a long line but it moves very fast and the pastries are warm and fresh. I've tried the egg hash brown and cheese, apple, chocolate, and ham and cheese ones and they were all good"
,,,,,"Everything here smacks the palette in a satisfying way, but their Curry Beef pastry pales in comparison to Me Sum, could use a bit of salt. Get a drink, it can get a bit dry. Try the Salmon pastry."
,,,,,Their pastries are definitely a pike place favorite for me. Love their mushroom and potato piroshkies!
,,,,,Yes. Yes. And more yes! Every piroshky we tried was delicious ! My fav was the jalapeño cheese link. If you're in the area I would def recommend trying one or all of their items
,,,,,"Thank you so much Gabe - we  will be visiting California with PRE ORDER only  POP-UPs this month- we help  to bring other business to California as well , we will be in SPARK social in SF- please let your family and friends know so they can get their fix! "
,,,,,"There's a long line for a reason! The guys are quick and efficient with our orders. The treats, savory and sweet are amazing and filling."
,,,,,"I've had their beef, maybe, and smoked salmon options through the food truck during winter carnival at Magnusson and also had the pleasure of eating at the old 3rd Ave location. Super yummy, full of comfort, simpler food prepared well."
,,,,,Going to be the unpopular opinion here and say I don't get the hype.
,,,,,Line was long but moved quickly. We were backed up to the old Starbucks but waited less than 10 minutes. Service was also quick but friendly. I didn't feel rushed into making a decision. I went with the acclaimed Smoked Salmon Pate. It was alright. Pastry was OK. The filling reminded me of salmon mixed with cream cheese (which I'm not a fan of). My friend got the Apple Cinnamon Roll. She didn't love hers either. I tried it and thought it lacked flavor and way too much dense dough. 
,,,,,"Not terrible, but not something I would go out of my way for. Next!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,We passed by here on our Eat Seattle tour and I really wanted to try it. It reminded me of what we call kolaches in the midwest. It is a bread outside with either sweet or savory insides. 
,,,,,After our tour when we headed back over here the line was LONG. I went up near the front and asked someone how long they had been waiting and they said less than 10 minutes.  We decided to wait - it did move quickly - impressively so. 
,,,,,"I ordered the beef and cheese and was concerned it wouldn't be very warm - but it was! It was $7 and I did think that was bit on the high side as I could have easily eaten 2, but it was tasty. Hubby and I shared it and both were glad we stopped."
,,,,,"My wife enjoyed the smoke salmon but I was not too impressed.   We ordered the smoked salmon, beef & cheese, and the apple & cranberry."
,,,,,We are from Southern California and this reminds of beachside food.  It's not my type of food but it may be yours.
,,,,,Pretty good for what it is. There are better places to get this type of food but because it is in public market it will be popular. It's pretty consistent in quality and usually pretty fresh because of the traffic. My favorite is the traditional beef and onion. It's a little bit on the greasy side for my liking but it's really good flavor and the crust is nice and flaky. The tasted reminded me of of a philly cheesesteak without the cheese. My boyfriend recently tried the Apple cinnamon piroshky and although I thought it was really pretty but he did not much like it. He said there wasn't much added sweetness and it tasted mostly like raw apples. He has a sweet tooth though so if you like your dessert on the less sweet side this could be ideal for you!
,,,,,Piroshky is hands down my favorite pastry/bread. Today I went to Pike Market area with my friend and we got some piroshky. I got a veggie chipotle piroshky. This is one of my favs. It's a vegan based bread and it has a little kick to it. Really loved the flavor and the bread was very soft and fresh. Love love love it!!! I got potato mushroom one in the past and absolutely loved that one as well. Piroshky is a must go place every time I go to the Pikes Market regardless how long the line will be. I would recommend whoever enjoys a soft bread with flavorful fillings to check this out and whoever visits Seattle.
,,,,,"I'm not a fan of big-hype places, but every visit to Pike Place, I always passed by Piroski. Let me tell you why this place may or may not be for you:"
,,,,,"Quality. Indeed, the variety of breads and their respective qualities are worthy of waiting in line. We tried the cinnamon bread and the salmon bread. Both tasted excellent and stayed well during our travels. If you are not sure what to order (this might happen due to the variety), just ask one of the employees and they will direct you to some of the goodies."
,,,,,"Pricing. I thought $4-6 per piece of bread was a little steep, but then I saw customers who bought $50 or more worth and took them home. If price is not an issue, then by all means go for it if you're a bread fan, especially bread of the Russian tradition."
,,,,,"Wait times and hype. Piroski is one of those places you want to try once, but will depend entirely on you whether a second or third trip is worth it. The line can be unbearably long (30 min or longer) and is tough for those with children. Their breads are good, but definitely not the best breads I have tried."
,,,,,The food is amazing but be ready for a long line during the weekend.  A must hit spot if you're from out of town and hitting Pike Place Market.  They are ALL delicious!!!
,,,,,"Waited in a long line listening to a staff member repeat her sales pitch on the sidewalk multiple times. Very unnecessary. Drove a ways out to eat a beef and cheese piroshky, and it was the only one they neglected to give me. Didn't realize it until I got back to my car. I drive way too far and won't be coming back."
,,,,,"This review is long over due. I was in Seattle for fourth of July for vacation. I never heard of this place until my cousins (who I was traveling with) mentioned it. The line was long since it went to the edge of the street, but it moved pretty quick. I thought we were going to be in line for at least 30 minutes from the length, but we ended up getting inside and ordering after almost 20 minutes of standing in line. A worker was managing the line and it helped keep us organized. I really appreciated that. "
,,,,,"Since we were out of state, we decided to get one of each popular piroshky: salmon, cheese, beef,potato, and a few others. They were all really good, but I would say Salmon, beef and potato and cheese were my favorite. "
,,,,,We also stood in front of a neighboring shop to eat our food since we couldn't wait. I would say this place is worth the line and wait. Just be sure to know what you want to try since they have a variety to choose from. 
,,,,,Workers were also nice and helpful. It is an extremely busy and touristy area so it will get crowded. They might also run out of some flavors if you come to late. Will return again when I visit seattle(again).
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is an absolute staple to any visit home to Seattle, where I'm originally from. Every time I go home I force my family to take me here and wait in the line so I can get a beef and cheese. Piroshky piroshky is also my very first recommendation to anyone asking me what to do or eat on their trip to Seattle. "
,,,,,The beef and cheese is my pastry of choice and it's absolutely to die for. The cheese and beef are just hot and melty and well flavored with a thick and flaky dough pastry around it. It's my perfect idea of food. 
,,,,,"Their dessert pastries are also delicious, but the beef and cheese is the main reason I go. "
,,,,,The line is intimidatingly long most of the time (for good reason) but it moves fairly quick and is absolutely worth the wait. I usually have no problem sitting inside even though it's limited seating because most people get them to go. 
,,,,,Another perk: they serve Martinelli's apple juice (you know those little ones in the circular jug bottles?) which complements the pastry well.
,,,,,"First time eating a Piroshky! I had to tried them because for the time that I was out here , there was always a line. I went during the week so there was no line. I tried the apple & cranberry, beef and onion, chocolate & spinach ham & cheese. My favorite was the beef and onion. Great for breakfast or lunch !!!! Customer service is nice, the place is clean, they get you in and out very quick! Highly recommended if you ever come by the public Market in Seattle"

,,,,,Don't pass this place up!!! Get there early so you can beat the line. These pastries are melt in your mouth delicious.
,,,,,"The veggie chipotle, potato and cheese, and potato and mushroom piroshky are all great options to pick. Very quick service and convenient locations."
,,,,,Finally we get to try pastries from Piroshky Piroshky! Husband had to line up as soon as it opened and grab a bunch for all of us. Good thing we were staying nearby. No need to drive here and look for parking.
,,,,,NUTELLA PASTRY - predictably good and predictably nondescript.
,,,,,APPLE STRUDEL - pretty darned good.
,,,,,CHEESE AND GARLIC - very yummy
,,,,,SPINACH AND EGG - very filling. great breakfast.
,,,,,VEGGIES - used cabbage. Very good.
,,,,,"SMOKED SALMON - my favorite. I took a bite of everything and I kept coming back to this pastry. Yes, it might be a tad bit fishy and I love it!"
,,,,,Came here with a friend and got the mushroom and onion bun along with the oscar's star. The mushroom and onion bun was packed full of savory mushroom and onion encompassed in a perfectly complimenting flaky bun. The oscar's star was a flaky cake donut type bread topped with cream cheese icing and chocolate glaze. The treat was scrumptious and according to the menu is a kid favorite.
,,,,,There was a line out the door but the menu moved very quickly and handed out menus as we waited so we could order as soon as we got to the counter. Would definitely come here to try everything else on the menu here. Can not recommend enough!
,,,,,Incredible! Had the apple cinnamon pastry and it was delicious. Melted in your mouth. A must try! Also had the potato and cheese. Like a hash brown in a bun! Outstanding!!
,,,,,"First time in Seattle and at first I was nervous for line. But not only did the line move quickly, but it was well worth it! The food was delicious. I ended up getting the Moscow roll and the potato and cheese. Super yummy!"

,,,,,Great for a quick walkable bite in Pike Place Market. There are often lines most days but it moves quickly. What makes it great in the area is you can eat without finding a seat which is hard to come by during the pandemic and I imagine this area in general. We had the jalapeño sausage roll that was similar to a kolachee and the apple cranberry which was sweet and flavorable.
,,,,,"As we were walking through the market, we saw the line for Piroshky Piroshky and wondered what all the fuss was about! Wow!! No wonder the line was so long. The Piroshky was amazing! We had a beef and cheese, smoked salmon, and an orange cream! All three were fantastic! Highly recommend waiting in that line!"
,,,,,"That inviting smell of freshly baked hand-held pies! I got the chance to try out this famous bakery at one of their pop-up stands. On the pricier side, but all three of the savory piroshkis that I ate were baked to perfection."
,,,,,-----
,,,,,"Smoked Salmon Pate: smoked salmon, cream cheese, a dash of dill and onion ($7)."
,,,,,The cream cheese mixture lifted the filling with a refreshing taste. I would have preferred a stronger smokiness to the salmon to bring out that contrast. It's also cute that they shape the piroshky as a fish.
,,,,,-----
,,,,,Beef and Cheese Piroshky: mix of seasoned ground beef and sharp cheddar ($7).
,,,,,Probably my favorite among the three: very cheesy and the beef was well seasoned.
,,,,,-----
,,,,,"Veggie Chipotle Piroshky: black beans, field roast crumble, diced bell pepper, cilantro, and onion seasoned with chipotle blend ($6)."
,,,,,Beans were soft and the spiciness was subtle. Although this one had a higher proportion of bread than filling compared to the other two piroshkis.

,,,,,"Not much to say about this place. It's a mom and pop bakery with absolutely delicious pastries. Not a very well kept secret, if you time it wrong you will be waiting in a line that rivals an amusement park. "
,,,,,I had a warm pirosky with ham and spinach and a Martinelli it was a very delicious light breakfast option.
,,,,,My girlfriend had the poppyseed cinnamon roll and a small coffee.... she still talks about the cinnamon roll every chance she gets.
,,,,,"If you're in the area definitely stop by, especially if you can avoid a long line."
,,,,,Many folks head to Pike Market in Seattle to see the fish being famously thrown; we head straight to Piroshky Piroshky for their delicious hot yummy pockets perfect for a meal or dessert.  You'll know you're close when you see the line :) Don't miss this gem!
,,,,,Those fish guys aren't the only ones who can throw some salmon! Thank you for your lovely review! Come back and see us again soon. Cheers!
,,,,,Great taste. Only con is that they're only amazing when piping hot. So make sure to get what's fresh outta the oven.
,,,,,"The long lines are worth it.    Our favorite is the chicken curry but they're all great.  Plus, they re-heat very well, particularly if you have a convection oven or a convection setting on your toaster (350 for 7 minutes does the trick)."
,,,,,"Believe the hype, eat here! We picked up food from here 3 days in a row--beef/onion, the Moscow, potato/cheese, sausage, all great but THE POPPY SEED!! Get the poppy seed, it's incredible !!"
,,,,,"I ran into place, well actually I ran into the long line that extended out from this place, so I decided to give it a go. I had the Cinnamon Poppy Roll not just because it sounded great but looked great from the window display I found myself salivating at. "
,,,,,"The flavors of this roll were spot on. The natural flavor of the bread roll, infused with the natural cinnamon, and then those deep black poppy seeds with their subtle nutty flavor. "
,,,,,"The texture of the rolls was good but not as soft as I expected. The edges were a little dry. I'm not sure if that's just the way the rolls are here or it just happen to be a roll that was sitting for a bit. Judging from the lines and turn around at this place, I suspect the latter. "
,,,,,"The bakery is certainly worth the stop, especially if you are a fan of fresh baked European goods."
,,,,,"I have no idea how this place garnered so many reviews, but I am convinced those who enjoyed what they ate here have zero exposure to actual, authentic piroshki. Ridiculously doughy and yeasty bun layer filled with what can only be described as subpar cheese and potato and meats. I tried their bestseller option, along with three other not even memorable items. And don't get me started on the disastrous poppy seed sweet one... skip skip skip, if only for the sake of your taste buds. (Also, way overpriced.)"
,,,,,"Visited around 5pm on a weekday and there was only a short line (and it went pretty quickly). The workers there are so so friendly it put me in a great mood! I'd never tried a piroshky before and I went into it expecting a warm, buttery bread filled with a lot of flavor inside. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this really is just normal yeasted bread filled with a small amount of meat/cheese. It tasted much better when I microwaved it at home, but I wouldn't say it was as amazing as people had hyped it up to be."
,,,,,"I opted for the smoked salmon piroshky - the filling was great; it tasted exactly like smoked salmon cream cheese. I wish there was more of it (the ratio of bread to filling was quite high). They do offer many other things too though, so I would come back to try something else!"
,,,,,"Hi Clara,"
,,,,,We are sorry to hear our bakery didn't meet your expectations. That's excellent that you enjoyed the staff and that you're willing to give us another try next time you're in town! We look forward to seeing you again.

,,,,,It's a warm and comforting place with long history. 
,,,,,"Never forget that when I moved to Seattle in a wet and windy winter day, I stepped into this store and bought a salmon bread. "
,,,,,The warm bread really warmed me a lot. 
,,,,,It's also a good place to garb a bread then  enjoy the sea near the Pike Place Market.
,,,,,Okay so I'm only giving 5/5 for the taste of the food because it is delicious! The service was disgraceful for the workers didn't even give us a chance to finish saying our order. I don't know if the workers haven't eaten their lunch or something but they were just aggressive & rude placing our pastries onto the table. There was no good customer service at all not even a thank you. It was just disappointing for I was actually excited to try this recommendation from a friend.

,,,,,"There was a long line, but it moved at a decent pace. The most memorable thing was the lady who helped monitor the line...she was entertaining and efficient. "
,,,,,"Honestly, though, it was overrated. We got the smoked salmon pastry, which the lady said was really popular, but we didn't think anything was that great about it. It was good - yes - but not worth waiting in that long line for. $7 was a decent price, though."
,,,,,"My recommendation? Send your friend to nearby Beecher's to wait in that line while you wait in the Piroshky line (or vice versa), and then share. Both are good, but you'll save time by splitting up!"

,,,,,They were all delicious in their own way and I would buy them all again! 
,,,,,"The pumpkin braid was sweet and spicy, a little doughy, but really delicious flavor. The hazelnut chocholate was probably my favorite! The curry chicken was almost like a meal on its own because of the flavors. And oscars star, was bigger than either of us expected it to be! "

,,,,,Beef and Cheese PiroshkyPotato and Mushroom Piroshky 
,,,,,These 2 are my favorites. I absolutely LOVE this place. My husband introduced me to this place about 15yrs ago. It was love st first bite. Same with my girls. My youngest especially. She's now 17 and when we go to Seattle she is always asking to get a Piroshky. Definitely recommend this to EVERYONE!!
,,,,,"A brisk October morning, 26 years to the day after yours truly first greeted this world, I embarked on my first exploration of the great city of Seattle. My first stop? Piroshky Piroshky. "
,,,,,"I arrived around 8:30 on a Thursday morning and to my delight, there wasn't a line at all. Must have been because there were already 50 people hanging out down by the OG 'Bucks trying to get their photos in. Walking into Piroshky Piroshky is what I imagine the pearly gates to be like: the beautiful smell of buttery pastry filling the air, the warmth to shield you from the windy chill of the morning air, and the perpetually-smiling employees to assist you in your piroshky selection... All just *chefs kiss* perfection. "
,,,,,"I ultimately went with the smoked salmon pate piroshky, and it blew my entire mind wide open. Serving both as a hand- and belly-warmer, this beautiful pastry was the best possible way to kick off my birthday. The dough:filling ratio was perfect, with smoked salmon flavor shining through each bite while not overwhelming the pastry. The pastry had a little bit of a toasty outside while remaining fluffy inside. My only regret was not purchasing a dozen more."
,,,,,It was yummy. The line moved pretty quickly. It was reasonably priced. You should atleast try if youre in Pike Place.
,,,,,"We've been recommended to check this place out multiple times. Holy moly, am I glad we did. The pastries look hard and dry on the outside but it's just a bite of heaven. None of them were dry or hard. They were all so soft and delicious. Worth the hype!"
,,,,,"We ordered the smoked salmon, beef & cheese, cinnamon braid and the marzipan roll. We ordered the last 2 because they were the most popular but I wish we went another way. Good but not as good as the savory ones! The marzipan was the plainest one."
,,,,,Our favorite was the beef and cheese. It was so juicy and just packed with beef all the way to the edges. I wish I hadn't shared this one.
,,,,,"Other reviews mentioned that the smoked salmon was too much and after several bites, it got overwhelming. I did not experience this at all. I am very picky and don't like creamy tastes but every bite was so delicious."
,,,,,"Don't confuse the original Starbucks line to this line! It gets confusing and we were confused before we realized we were in the wrong line. Even if the line is long, it moves very quickly so worth the wait!"
,,,,,"Yum! We have been meaning to try this place for about a year now and finally got around to it. We tried a beef and onion and a smoked salmon with pate; both tasted fresh and flavorful and were honestly perfectly sized. They were out of a couple kinds that we would have normally gotten, but we loved the ones we tried and will be back to try more. The only mistake I believe we made was not getting something sweet!"
,,,,,"Straight up, this is my favorite ""walking food"" in the city. Any time I have a visitor, I bring them here! There's literally NOTHING bad on the menu!"
,,,,,"I'm not sure if we just got an older batch or what, but this trip was a little underwhelming and did not live up to the hype, to be quite honest. This is maybe the 2nd time I had Piroshky's and neither times have made me go ""this place is a MUST while visiting Pike Place"". I got the bacon, hash browns, egg, and cheese pastry and it was just okay. It felt like more bread than filling and I was personally not a big fan of the bread either. I personally would have preferred a flaky pastry rather than the texture of pretty much a loaf of bread. Maybe this was a bad batch, I don't know. I don't mind trying it again in the future but it will not be my go-to pastry shop."
,,,,,"I am Ukrainian, so when I heard I was now living a good 20 minute drive from this place, it became part of my weekend routine."
,,,,,"Pre COVID, the lines were a little nuts, zig zagging through Pikes with a person regulating it at the front. During COVID I've been there a few times when allowed, and the wait was only a couple minutes, although I haven't been back yet since the protests started."
,,,,,"The Piroshky themselves are consistently delicious with a lot of variety, regardless of timing. There are a lot of traditional savory choices - with cabbage and onion, potato and dill, and different kinds of meat. There are also sweet choices with apple, cinnamon and my favorite being the poppyseed roll which is very sweet, sticky and messy but oh so worth it! "
,,,,,The service is always excellent too. Highly recommend!

,,,,,"I'm really glad I got to try this place while I was in Seattle! I ordered the beef and cheese, smoked salmon pate, and the cinnamon cardamon braid. "
,,,,,"Beef and cheese: Overall, I think it was a good choice. However, I wish there was a bit more meat. I still very much enjoyed it though. It was very filling and super tasty."
,,,,,"Smoked salmon pate: This is definitely a MUST! It was super flavorful and was salty, but not overpowering at all. If I ever come back to this place, I would definitely order this one again. "
,,,,,"Cinnamon cardamon braid: This was a nice little sweet dessert to have after eating the previous pockets. It had just the right amount of cinnamon! It did taste a little tarty (which I'm not a huge fan of), but it was bearable, and I still really liked it."
,,,,,"Also, don't be fooled by the long line you see outside of this place! It goes by fairly quickly. I believe I waited less than 10 minutes and there was a good amount of people in front of me. Plus, the employee that's managing the line is super helpful in deciding what to order and gives many great tips on what to do in Seattle!"
,,,,,"I love savory pastries much more than sweet pastries, so I was intrigued by Piroshky Piroshky and their large number of savory items. The line forms outside the tiny store, down off the sidewalk (look for the queue lines). They had an employee outside directing us when we stopped by but there was no long line yet. They give you a big picture menu so you can get an idea of what you want and can order quickly. I was torn but ended up getting the beef and cheese piroshky. There is no seating in the immediate area, but if you continue through the building there are a few tables in the back."
,,,,,"The beef and cheese piroshky reminded me of a croissant crossed with a biscuit, with some ground beef and melted cheese inside. It was delicious! It was steaming hot and large enough to share with my boyfriend as a snack. Prices range from around $7-$9 per item but again, they're pretty large. I am so bummed I wasn't able to try any of the other piroshkies but would definitely go back. I would even try a sweet piroshky next time, because I'm sure they're amazing."
,,,,,"Definitely worth the wait. I got here around 8:30am and there was already a line. Fortunately, it wasn't down the street like it normally is, and it went quickly. I had just gotten a coffee and was told that this place has awesome pastries, so I tried it out. This place has a great selection of savory and sweet pastries. I heard everyone in front of me order the apple cinnamon roll, so I ordered an apple cinnamon roll and a chocolate cannoli. The apple cinnamon roll was made with real apples and was so soft and warm when I got. It was definitely a crowd favorite and quickly became mine. It went perfect with my coffee. The cannoli was also warm as if it was just made. Another great addition to my coffee."
,,,,,The service was also great. The lady who helped me was very welcoming and even made a couple recommendations about the pastries. I will absolutely be back for more.
,,,,,"Hey Patrick,"
,,,,,"Thanks so much for the great review and pics! We're so happy you came by our bakery, we love our California visitors! Glad the line moved fast as well, we know it can be daunting but the team tries their best to make it go by quick! Have a great new year and we hope to see you again the next time you're in Seattle!"
,,,,,"Thank you,"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky always smells and looks amazing, but the food quality is seriously meh. Got the beef and cheese pie, which I would rate 3.5/5. The flavor is good but the dough encasing it is seriously average. Also got the Bulgarian cream pie, which I would rate 2/5 because it isn't good. Tasteless filling and joyless, doughy outer pastry."
,,,,,My favorite go to. It is a Seattle  treasure.  Anything with salmon or anything with beef is my go to.
,,,,,"Came here to get a beef and cheese piroshki. There was a small line outside the door, but it moved quick. I had to wait only 5 minutes to get inside the shop to order and they hand you the food immediately."
,,,,,"I think the beef and cheese could use a little more flavor, it tastes a little bland."
,,,,,Might come back to try another one of the pastries.
,,,,,A bit touristy but I can't refuse their stuff. Super yummy and I love their savory bites.
,,,,,"A quick weekend trip to Seattle and we stopped by this little bakery for some buns. I am so sorry to say that it's over hyped for us, the flavour really stands out but the bread itself was like dripping oil. If you are curious about it and the queue is short, get one and try it!"
,,,,,Tasty piroshkis.  I get the vegetarian ones.  The fillings are good.  I like the one with potatoes and another vegetable or maybe herb; I forget what.
,,,,,It's a Seattle touristy thing to do but definitely not worth it. Could be more flavorful. I've been multiple times and been disappointed every time.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Love this place! Was recommended this place by my sister but our friends stumbled upon it by following their noses. Honestly, you don't even really have to seek this place out - you can just be within 15-20 feet of this place and their lovely smells will lure you in quickly. "
,,,,,"The line was out the door and onto the sidewalk every time we passed by but thankfully they're very coordinated and had a person guiding customers into the bakery when there was room. The staff member walked by with the menu quickly and asked if anyone needed to take a picture to help them decide what to get. These guys are nothing if not efficient and it's for your best interest! We were in and out of the bakery within two minutes - if you're willing to wait in line, you won't be waiting long once you get in there. "
,,,,,"We got the cinnamon cardamom braid and it was delicious. They have a large assortment of sweet and savory items and I wish that we had more room in our stomachs to get more than what we did but it really is a great place, just let your nose be the judge of that!"
,,,,,As you walk through the streets of Pike the aroma of freshly baked pastries fills the air and 9 out of 10 times it's Piroshky Piroshky you're smelling! 
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is one of the staple places you try when you come to Seattle. Some people may think otherwise, but I think the taste is just as good as the smell! The only reason I give it a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because this location always has a line. I don't like to wait in lines, so I prefer to go to  the location in South Center Mall or the food truck that sometimes appears down south in Tacoma at Point Ruston. "
,,,,,"I love all of their items, but my favorite is their Smoked Salmon pastry. Can you say heaven?! It just melts in your mouth and keeps you wanting more and more until you've eaten the whole thing! "
,,,,,"I also really like Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll if I'm craving something on the sweet side! I also really like their Ham, Cheese, and Spinach pastry but that's just because I really love ham and cheese. If you're looking for a speciality I definitely recommend getting their Smoked Salmon (unless you don't like seafood or are allergic)."
,,,,,"Delicious piroshkies!! The line was long but went so fast.  The lady managing the line is very organized and tells everyone what they need to do to get their food.  We tried 3 of their best sellers, the two meats and the apple!  Reasonably priced and delicious!!!"
,,,,,Decently good. Maybe... Overrated? I mean the food was good but... I don't have a good answer for this. I'll say 3.5 if I'm being honest. It's fun watching them make the pastries though.
,,,,,People are super nice though and blazing fast.
,,,,,"Ordered beef and onion, nice and flaky."
,,,,,Beef and cheese
,,,,,Forgetting one... Dangit
,,,,,"Cinnamon cardamom braid, pass. We didn't finish this one. Again it's not bad by any means, it was decent."
,,,,,"Friendly service, short wait "
,,,,,"Never had piroshky before, it was definitely worth it."
,,,,,Definitely will be returning next time I'm in Seattle!
,,,,,"Salmon Piroshky is the one to get here.  Great breading with a creamy, salmony, and salty filling. It's shaped like a fish so kids love it, but also very fun loving adults.  Some say these fool bears too.  "
,,,,,"Anyways, small store, but they are doing social distancing and employees have masks."
,,,,,I don't understand the hype but...to each their own. I got the salmon pate and the beef and cheese. Beef and cheese was better. I love salmon and really wanted it to taste good but it really wasn't hitting for me. The sweeter options smelled awesome.
,,,,,"I was very excited about visiting piroshky piroshky because many people had talked about it as being one of the must visit food places in Seattle, yet I feel that this bakery did not live up to the hype."
,,,,,"We went in the late morning and waited in line for about 10-15 minutes, which is not bad considering the hype. The employees there surely do move fast."
,,,,,"We got 3 items to share between 2 people: Salmon, beef & cheese, and onion & beef. Both my friend and I agreed that they were all a little bland. The onion and beef was the most flavorful of the 3, yet we still thought that it could've used a little more flavor. "
,,,,,"Portion wise they were very generous, the 2 of us were both very full by the time we finished sharing the 3 pieces of baked goods. In fact, I had some difficulty finishing the 3rd piece because I was so full and the food wasn't exactly the best. "
,,,,,"Price wise we paid ~$21 for 3 items, which I thought was a little over priced. But considering how this bakery is located in a touristy market by downtown and that it is so famous, I was ok with paying that price. "
,,,,,"Overall I felt that the taste of the food was average so I was disappointed since it was so hyped up. I think it was worth it to try it out just to see what the hype was all about, but would I go back again just for the food? Probably not."
,,,,,This place is great for piroshky. 
,,,,,I had the salmon pate one and it was crafted beautifully 
,,,,,"The dough was slightly sweet. Crunchy on top because of the ridge they folded, added a nice texture. Inside was a mixed layer of smoked salmon, cream cheese, finely chopped dill and onion. My American self initially thought ""Wow there isn't a lot of filling here"". But then I had to remind myself.... this isn't a jelly donut mmmmkay? "
,,,,,After eating more bites I learned the filling was the perf amount. Not too much not too little. Part of the reason is because the dough isn't very thick! It's a good equal ratio of filling to dough. 
,,,,,Anyhoo. The flavors were great and seasoned well. I love salmon to begin with. It's like a lox bagel but piroshky style instead! I really appreciate the small cuts of onion and dill. It takes effort to chop onions that small! I didn't even notice they were there until I examined the filling. 
,,,,,"I can't say piroshkys are something I crave, or actively search for. But if I'm ever in the mood. I know where to go"
,,,,,"When my wife and I found out we were moving to Seattle, as avid foodies, we did some research. YouTube, Google searches, word of mouth. And Piroshky Piroshky was almost on every single one of them. "
,,,,,And rightfully so. 
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky beautifully melds a little bit of Seattle with a touch of Russian flair. I ordered the Salmon one and the Marzipan. And they were both outstanding!
,,,,,"The salmon is so flavorful and savory, and just melts your mouth. I can't wait to eat one on a cold Seattle winter (not looking forward to that) with some chowder nearby. And the marzipan is delightful, but warning: it is pretty sweet. But given my sweet tooth, it was perfect for me. "
,,,,,My wife and I live 10 min walking distance away from Pike Place. This is both a blessing and a curse. 
,,,,,Beautiful and delicious pastries. But here comes the weight gain...
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Yasssss! You don't need the line out the door to see this place is amazing! Savory meats and cheese wrapped up a Russian pastry and baked to perfection. I was not ready for the amazingness. 
,,,,,"Go early, as the day progresses the line gets longer and longer. The breakfast piroshky was my favorite. Eggs, cheese, bacon!  "
,,,,,"If you get caught in line, no worries! It goes quick and the people are friendly. Because the lines long and they are always packed the piroshkies are always hot and fresh. "
,,,,,"You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Seriously, this place is amazing!"
,,,,,"I have found my love for bread again. I'm so glad we came here while visiting Seattle! It's right next door to the 1st Starbucks and the queue system is very efficient. While you're in line, look at the menu and make sure you know what you want before ordering. I've been here 3 different times during my visit. "
,,,,,FOOD
,,,,,SALMON PATE: so much salmon and they make the bread in the shape of the fish! My top favorite and reoccurring item we bought in our 3 visits. It was still good even when it has been refrigerated.
,,,,,"MOSCOW ROLL: my second favorite item. This was part of the sweet items, but the roll itself wasn't too sweet. I really enjoyed it. "
,,,,,"CURRY CHICKEN AND RICE: if you want to try other food, make sure to share this with one or two people! This was pretty good, but too heavy as the rice will fill you up quickly. The curry smell and taste is strong. "
,,,,,"BEEF AND CHEESE: this was the 1st thing I wanted off the menu and they ran out of it during my first visit. I finally got it my 2nd time, but unfortunately it wasn't my favorite. It's still delicious and very similar to the curry chicken and rice for me. However, it's not an item I'd order again as I want to try the other stuff on their menu."
,,,,,"MUSHROOM, ONION AND CELERY: this reminds me of the veggie dumplings you can find in the Asian markets, so the taste was very familiar to me. "
,,,,,"BACON, HASHBROWN, EGG AND CHEESE: I was expecting this to be very heavy, but surprisingly it was not. There's a generous amount of hash browns. This was my 3rd favorite one. "
,,,,,"CINNAMON CARDANA BRAID: I hate raisins but I didn't taste any of that in here! This turned out to be better than I anticipated, and definitely on the sweet side."
,,,,,POPPYSEED CINNAMON ROLL: the poppyseed definitely made the roll stand out a bit more. It's on the sweeter side and goes very well with a glass of milk or cup of coffee.
,,,,,SERVICE
,,,,,Staff is friendly and seemingly enjoying working there! They have a staff who facilitates the line. LOVE IT! 
,,,,,WOULD I COME BACK?
,,,,,OH YES. I'm hoping to ask friends who will be visiting here in the future to bring me back one or two items!
,,,,,"I heard this place was very popular and I came here on a Thursday during lunch time and there was no line. I ordered the smoked salmon pate and my group was still waiting for the order so I took a bite of it when I was still inside and the workers told me it was to go only. However, there was no where to eat it and it was raining and we tried to eat it outside but we got yelled at by passerbyers for not wearing a mask. I wish the restaurant put out tables and chairs outside then. But it was still good and I'd like to come back and try other items."
,,,,,"Reminds me of my grandmas cooking! We each got a sweet and savory piece. My favorite was the beef and cheese and then then rhubarb one!!! My husband got the egg and hash brown one and the chocolate filled one. He said his were better but I liked my choices better! It just goes to show they were all really freaking good! And just like the lady in the street screams, ""it was the fastest line in the markets"""
,,,,,"It was my first time having Russian pastries and I would highly recommend this place to anyone! This location is rather small, and right now during covid they only allow one person at a time inside. The Beef and Cheese Piroshky exceeded my expectations. It was all so good! The mix of the beef and cheese, and the softness of the bread.  I finished it and only wished I had gotten another one. If you plan on visiting this location be aware that there may a long line depending on the time of day."
,,,,,Thank you Maria - We will be visiting California with PRE ORDER only   POP-UPs this month- we help  to bring other business to California as well - please let your family and friends know so they can get their fix! 
,,,,,"I do not find the baked goods here all that special AND I have tried most of their sweet and savory options. I feel it is mostly famous due to the pike place tourist traffic. The queues everywhere in PP market can also be pretty significant and so if you had to choose a queue, definitely maybe not this one."
,,,,,Looking for a tasty bite this place has the best pastries in the city! I was in town for a visit couldn't leave without trying it. I tried the salmon and the hash brown one and it was to die for! I would totally be back for more!
,,,,,"Thank you for your kind words, Beatriz! We are glad you enjoyed our salmon and hash brown Piroshky. Come back and see us again soon!"
,,,,,Love coming here for their pastries!
,,,,,"This is one of my must-eats when I'm in the Seattle area. I always get one of the potato pastries because potatoes are life. There wasn't a line this time when I visited, but one quickly formed right when I left. The shop is really small and the display case is right where you pay, so definitely step aside if you don't know what you want off the bat. The workers were getting a bit upset at people who stood at the head of the line just perusing while a line slowly built up."
,,,,,"I'm not sure if they let you heat up your pastry, but mine could've used a little warming up. It was quite lukewarm, and the weather was a bit rainy. Hot, steamy mashed potatoes would've made me a super happy camper, but lukewarm potatoes got the job done too."
,,,,,"Hard working Russian family.  Good business, consistent quality, great food.  Hope they run forever"
,,,,,"I got the potato mushroom & onion piroshky. It's vegan! The dough is fluffy and baked well. The filling with flavorful and quite mushroomy, so if you don't like the strong taste of mushrooms then this might not be the one for you. I also tried to rhubarb sweet piroshky. It was good with the same bread as the vegan ones but I prefer the savory ones."
,,,,,"The is outside the shop, but it moves very quickly. It's best if you know what you want before you go to the shop since it's quite hectic inside. It's pretty much a grab and go -- not a lot of space to sit down and eat."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I'd give this place 6 stars if I could. Not only are their baked goods so frigging delicious and filling, but they give an amazing service if you're visiting from out of state and want to take some home to hold you over for the next time you visit Pike Place Market or their other locations."
,,,,,"When I asked if I could have them frozen and packed for shipping, they responded so quickly and said I could! That was so, so, so wonderful knowing I'm able to enjoy piroshky once I got back home. You just have to place an order online and ask for it frozen and packed for travel in the special instructions section of the order and schedule a time slot to pick it up from their production kitchen in the C building at 309 S Cloverdale Street."
,,,,,"The awesome customer service from email response to bringing my package to my car upon pickup is outstanding. They held up well during my 6 hour flight and the hour commute home and from defrosting to reheating, they're just as delicious."
,,,,,"I highly recommend anyone who is traveling to Seattle who hasnt visited this amazing bakery to give them a try. Sweet, savory, even seasonal baked goods, and vegan options!"
,,,,,Back in town for the first time in three years and Piroshky Piroshky was my first stop. My daughter was with me this time so she got the chocolate and hazelnut and I got the beef and onion like I always do. The beef and onion may be my favorite food I've ever eaten.
,,,,,Every time I go to Seattle I make a point of going to Piroshky Piroshky. In fact I try to go every day that I'm in town. This time I was there for four days and I ate here three of those days. The beef and onion Piroshki and the beef and cheddar Piroshki are some of the best things I've ever eaten period. One day I'll get around to trying their sweet Piroshki but for now I'm quite happy to continue to double fist the beef and onion every time I visit
,,,,,"One word, three letters: YUMMMMMMMM! "
,,,,,(Ok that was more than 3 letters but oh well lol)
,,,,,"We got lucky, the line was short but I imagine it would have moved quickly either way. "
,,,,,"We got the Beef & Cheese and the Salmon Piroshky, both which were recommended to us by the person that was helping us and OH BOY were they delicious. So so good! And it's big enough (in my opinion) to fill you up. "
,,,,,It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall across the way from North end of Pike's Place. Definitely worth stopping by!
,,,,,"RUN DONT WALK to this place! Their food is so amazing and at a surprisingly low price point for the quality! The place is tiny, and you are in and out fast. We got the chocolate cream hazelnut roll and my favorite- the cheddar garlic roll!"
,,,,,"Great part of my trip to Seattle!  Everyone had told me about how good Piroshky Piroshky was, and there was no disappointment.  Can't wait to get back to Seattle to try this place again.  Avoid the mid day line by going right before they close.  Much shorter wait time."
,,,,,Order the Smoked Salmon Pirosky 
,,,,,"Always made fresh and delicious spread of smoked salmon. You won't be disappointed, get two. One for now and another for later when you get home."
,,,,,"I'm sorry but overhyped and overpriced. So much bread and very little else. At $6 it's insulting if I didn't understand the location. Even The bulgogi one had very little meat and was $8. Really a bad attempt at fusion cuisine. Asian pastries have much more flavor and variety, are lighter and half the price if not less. It's been 16 years since I had a piroshky here and I'm not sure why I was looking forward to it. Thinking back, it wasn't that great back then either."
,,,,,Somehow Piroshky found it's way to my Instagram feed to let me know they were having an event on Bainbridge today! Looked them up on Yelp and found a high likelihood food would be good. 
,,,,,"I pre-ordered two days ago and picked up my order near downtown BI at noon. Food came individually packaged, frozen, in an individualized box with ice packs. Super convenient. No lines. Would I wait in line 30+ minutes for it, nope. Would I go out of my way to visit a location because I just have to have it, nah. Would I pre-order again if they make their way back out to BI, maybe! Minimum pre-order was $35. Ordered 7 items. You can stick what you want to save for later in the freezer. "
,,,,,"From frozen, takes 15-20 minutes in the oven. Your house will be smelling SO good! "
,,,,,"What we liked: Salmon, Meat and cheese, Chicken rice curry, Marzipan (a little too much almond filling and made me miss Copenhagen bakery in LA - would definitely get this again though)"
,,,,,"Not impressed: cheeseburger, Rhubarb (too much filling and mousse-like)"
,,,,,"Very tasty! Wasn't sure what to order, so went with the hazelnut cream piroshky. My only regret was not ordering more. Will definitely be visiting this place again next time I'm in Seattle."
,,,,,"I arrived to Pike Place at 9 am on a Saturday with a mission--to avoid waiting in lines. When I walked into Piroshky Piroshky, there was only one couple ahead of me. Mission accomplished. "
,,,,,"When I was at Pike Place yesterday, I noticed a big line at this little shop, so I knew it had to be somewhere to stop. My eyes widened as I looked over the display case. I finally settled with a chocolate cream hazelnut roll. I giddily walked over to an area to eat it. As soon as my teeth sunk into the flaky goodness, I was hooked. Have you ever just instantly loved something? I think mothers compare it to meeting their newborn. It was that feeling. "
,,,,,"The chocolate/hazelnut cream was perfection. It was amplified with the flavor of (maybe?) amaretto, as well as small pieces of hazelnut to add texture and love. This was absolutely the best pastry I've ever eaten. Now I need to figure out how to fit 100 of them in my suitcase..."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Got there around 5pm on a Saturday.  We had about about a 10min wait.  We got a beef and cheese and an apple cinnamon.  Both were very good. They were out of a couple of items.  Line moved fast and the staff was extremely friendly.
,,,,,"Wide range of selections for the Russian equivalent of a calzone. Everything from wild smoked salmon to beef and onions, stuffed inside a delicious bread shell."
,,,,,Back again in Seattle visiting my favorite bakery. Ordered a few of my favorites. The beef and onion  & chicken curry and rice was pretty good as usual. Flaky outside and the inside was similar to a curry bao. Also ordered a rhubarb one but forgot to give it to us. We'll definitely go back for more.
,,,,,"I went back the next day to have the  jalapeño sausage roll was again delicious. Sausage was juicy and snapped when bitten into it. This time, I also ordered the beef and onion roll which was on the other hand a flakey pie like soft crusted roll filled with a soft ground beef filling. It was good but very rich and heavy. Both was good but the sausage roll was a tastier."
,,,,,"Great bakery. Fresh rolls, sweet as well as salty ones. Long lines but worth the wait."
,,,,,"Classic Seattle spot, love all the choices. Fast service, friendly staff, never gets old."
,,,,,"This is a must visit little pastry bakery! I got the smoked salmon pate & the mushroom and potato piroshky and they were both delicious. On top of that, even though they're insaaaanely popular and busy the front line people working are so positive and nice!! The small conversation we managed to squeeze in was so genuine. Even the girl making the piroshky behind the counter was so sweet!!"
,,,,,"All I can say is that this place is worth the hype. There are a lot of places in Pike's Place to try, but this is definitely one of the ones to drop by and try out. The line can seem intimidating at first but it moves pretty quickly. Plus, you forget about the wait after you take your first bite lmao"
,,,,,"I'm basing my review off the salmon pate and the beef and cheese piroshky; I haven't had many Russian pastries before, but I really, really enjoyed these two so I feel like that's good enough lol"
,,,,,"The salmon pate was shaped like a fish, which was a cute detail that I really appreciated. But beyond that, the crunch of the pastry itself paired with the savory filling made each bite so enjoyable. The beef and cheese piroshky was also amazing; the taste slightly reminded me of a dimsum bao filling, which was a bit nostalgic for me and was probably why I enjoyed it more."
,,,,,"Overall, this is now one of the places that'll immediately come to mind when I think of Pike's Place. It's definitely a Seattle staple for me now :')"
,,,,,Love love loved this place! 
,,,,,Very unique and unlike anything I have ever eaten before. I am kicking myself for not taking pictures but you can't go wrong with anything from here. My daughter and I probably tried 10 different items from here and they were all insanely delicious. I wish we had this somewhere in Texas!!!
,,,,,"We love this place. All varieties are delicious. I like the poppy seed roll and the potato and onion piroshky. All varieties are very good we usually get 4-6 and mix and match throughout the day to try all the flavors and it's excellent. Great flakey dough, good buttery flavor and the fillings are all made with a lot of love and good tradition bon appetit"
,,,,,Friendly staff. 
,,,,,"Piroshkys were not good. The flavors were not there. Too doughy. As a Russian family we had high expectations and the line was lonnng, we don't see the appeal. Even the sweet one wasn't good. They had a long line every day so people must love their food. We were unimpressed."
,,,,,"Super long line, but moves fast. FYI, they have another location inland, no line if you're able to travel. "
,,,,, beef piroshki 
,,,,, cinnamon raisin 
,,,,, curry chicken (way too much curry)
,,,,, salmon--it's okay nothing special though super cute
,,,,,The dough is nice and flaky. 
,,,,,Service is very good.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,We were told this place was amazing . Kind of like a Russian bakery type thing. Not entirely sure.
,,,,,"In regards to the food itself: Well it wasn't what i expected. Maybe the hype was really high?not sure but definitely not what I had in mind. I had the salmon filled bread thing they serve. I did not even finish it. It was cold and I am not sure if you are supposed to heat it up at home but I doubt it. Maybe because it was towards end of day? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Also tried some other things, i cannot remember the name of, but I was not too impressed. My brother loved his food so I guess to each their own right?"
,,,,,"In regards to the parking, it is awful because it is right in the big fish place and so there is A LOT of people parked already most likely. There is pay parking which I guess can help you out."
,,,,,"The service? The service was great. Nice people, absolutely see no problems in that department."
,,,,,"In regards to the wait: well there was always a line but we decided o go almost at closing time and it was not so bad. Due to covid and i guess the space, they only allow 1 customer at a time so yea."
,,,,,Nonetheless be sure to check them out and then give us a shoutout/follow on instagram @thehungrynomadz
,,,,,Americans should eat more savory pastries! 
,,,,,"Do not miss the beer/onion pastry, it's THE BEST."
,,,,,"I agree with those who say this place is overhyped. I was super excited to try this place since everything on the menu looked unique and delicious. We ordered the smoked salmon pate. It was quite pricey at $7, and the taste didn't blow my mind in the slightest. It also was room temperature, which made it less appealing. Would probably like it better if it were warm and freshly baked. I was also surprised by how long the line was even with COVID and the fires going on. Overall, it was good to try since it's a touristy place, but quality-wise, I don't think it's worth it."
,,,,,"Amazing seattle staple get the salmon! Wasn't a big fan of the cinnamon apple. A must stop if you're in the area, best eaten fresh but putting it in the air fryer isn't bad."
,,,,,"Great bakery right across from pike place public market! The line seems long but it moves pretty fast. The inside of the store is really small and it gets kind of hectic. The rolls are $7-8 each and they have savory as well as sweet. I tried the beef and cheese, garlic, and the sausage one. The beef and cheese had a weird taste to it, that I didn't quite like but the garlic roll was great. Everything tasted really fresh."
,,,,,Omg! It was great!
,,,,,I've never expected piroshky is so good. 
,,,,,I and my mom visited Seattle before the pandemic and I saw this at yelp(thanks yelp!!!) and tried it. We stayed the hotel two blocks away so we bought some food including one savory and one sweet piroshki.
,,,,,You can also see they are making piroshki while you are waiting the line. 
,,,,,I'm sure I will be back next time I visit Seattle.
,,,,,"The place is a legend when it comes ""must go"" places in the Pike Market. "
,,,,,"We went on the Saturday that the first death of covid-19 was announced in Seattle. Back then, people were still not very nervous and anxious not knowing the extent of the infection. Anyway, Pike Market was busy as usual. The lady who were outside trying to get people in line was very nice and friendly. We waited about 10 minutes outside and most people seemed to have decided on what they want when they go in, which shows how popular this place is. "
,,,,,"We got two items, one of which is Khachapuri. It was very fresh, moist, and crispy. We sat indoor and finished it regrating not buying more. The shop is very small but they have four or even more staffs helping customers which made the line move pretty fast. "
,,,,,"After we came back from Washington state, the first wave of covid-19 hit Seattle hard and news about the Pike Market being a ghost town was everywhere. A few days ago, I saw the owner of this shop on CNN talking about how the spread of covid-19 was impacting their business. It made me sad that small business like Piroshky's Piroshky's are hit so hard and many people might lost their job.  Hope the fed and local gov can provide them with the help they need and get through these difficult times. Stay strong and take care!"
,,,,,"Went here this last year and we ordered one of everything they had... umm to say it was delicious is an understatement. Definitely recommend the smoked salmon, and the garlic cheese wheels"
,,,,,SO GOOD!! The smell itself is amazing- I've been to Russia twice and it brought back memories of some of the best pastries. Just the taste of the bread is so warm and flavorful.
,,,,,"We had the salmon pastry, the ground beef, and cinnamon twist. All completely delicious. Can't wait to come back to Seattle for this!"
,,,,,Another place on our Seattle tour that I was unbelievably jazzed about!
,,,,,"We took a walk through Pikes early Saturday morning and decided to grab a couple piroshkys around 9:30. There was already a line forming. I took that as a good sign. The staff was friendly and chipper, something else I really liked. "
,,,,,The line moved quickly and we were up to order - one salmon piroshky and one beef piroshky. I was kind of surprised by the salmon... because it lacked any salmon flavor (or flavor whatsoever). I mentioned I was disappointed with mine and my friend said they felt the same about the beef. 
,,,,,"For two, we paid roughly $14. Each piroshky was a sizable portion, so worth what you pay to fill your belly on the cheap."

,,,,,"We came in on Veteran's Day, pretty early in the morning. I think they'd only been open 30 minutes because there wasn't a line at all. I'd been excited to try this place out since I grew up in a predominantly Russian community and speak the language, and have eaten the food. The gal behind the counter was super sweet and patient. I asked her what was good and we got two items she recommended, which did not disappoint. It was a perfect hearty bite on-the-go while we explored Pike Place on a drizzling day. If we are ever back in Seattle, I will definitely stop by again."
,,,,,Truly unique and delicious. I always love to stop here.
,,,,,"They always have a line out of the door so I waited this time and tried many of their bread choices. There's a reason, this place is iconic in Seattle - fresh bakes, nice people, and quick service. The operation seemed to be running pretty smoothly despite the pandemic because they have a system - one party enters the space at a time so be ready for a line, especially in the afternoons. Upon entry, they are quick to let you choose your variety of choices, pay and exit. Not too friendly but nice service, nevertheless. The breads, themselves, were good - slightly sweet dough but nothing truly beats a fresh bread. Their filling options are quite extensive and unique. I do thing the sweet fruits could be a tad better tasting with more fruit filling to bread ratio so it doesn't seem doughy. But my personal favorite is the salmon one. It's so delish, light and oh so fresh. Do try it out when you can."
,,,,,The lines are long here with plenty of piroshki options but they move at a decent pace.  Only 1 party is allowed at a time inside. 
,,,,,I could not decide between the spinach and mushroom piroshki vs. the beef and onion one.  I asked for a recommendation and the person behind the counter suggested that the beef and onion option was better due to the flaky crust.  It was heated up and I'm happy it was.  I wasn't able to try the pastry for another 20 minutes or so and luckily it was still warm.
,,,,,The beef and onion piroshki was quite good and satisfying as a light lunch.  The dough was flaky and tender.  The filling was well seasoned and a bit saucy.
,,,,,There is no place to eat on site so be prepared to take your food and eat it elsewhere.
,,,,,"I honestly don't understand what the hype is about Piroshky Piroshky. Prices are reasonable, but the food is not that amazing. I've only tried their savory pieces which I found to be very oily. The flavors weren't amazing either."
,,,,,"Well, I feel like an outlier here but I'll just admit to not liking the food we got from Piroshky Piroshky."
,,,,,"We stood in a fairly fast moving line and had scoped out the menu ahead of time. We got in there and I did try to ask a question but felt 'shut down' by the service. They barely even looked us in the eyes and seemed very rushed. I understand they can only allow one set of customers in right now, so maybe that was it?"
,,,,,"We got a potato and mushroom, moscow rolls and a ham, egg and spinach. "
,,,,,The ham & egg was.. not edible to me. The insides were this weird flavorless mush. The potato and mushroom was OK. Bland and overly bread-y. The moscow roll was OK. I don't remember what it tasted like and just recall not really caring for it. 
,,,,,We both agreed we wouldn't go again. Just wasn't for us!
,,,,,I just found a new item I like and it's even a pastry!
,,,,,The beef and cheese was so good and filled up the entire bread which was also crunchy and fluffy. So glad I tried it cause now I'll be looking for it at all places I visit.
,,,,,"Good price, friendly staff, and plenty of parking"
,,,,,Tried a few different ones but the salmon was by far our favorite. Wait wasn't too long and the guys behind the counter were friendly. Nice stop as we went on our little foodie trip trying different things along the marketplace.
,,,,,The best in the North West!!You will find this nestled in the Pike Market
,,,,,Always a Seattle staple to stop by. I went twice once in the morning and once right before they closed a noticed a huge difference in the quality of the meat and bread. I would definitely go right when they open because everything is more fresh! I recommend trying to get beef & onion or beef & cheese

,,,,,I learned cream of wheat is not my type of pastry but I'm glad I tried Russian pastries. The bread is not as soft as I thought but the flavor combinations are amazing. My favorite to try was the sausage roll. The sausage was easy to pull apart and a perfect savory match. I was more of a fan of the flavors inside the bread than the actual dough itself.
,,,,,"I love this Russian bakery! There aren't many bakeries that offer savory pastries which are by far my favorite type of pastry. Last time I came I got the Potato and Mushroom Piroshky. This time I got the Veggie Chipotle. The veggie chipotle is more bread like than the potato mushroom which has more of a crispy factor to it. Both have been solid options, but I can't wait to go back and try more."
,,,,,"Honestly the company as a whole is a really awesome company, when the pandemic started the owner came up with a program to deliver food to help all the small businesses around pike place market! "
,,,,,"If that wasnt enough the food is amazing, handmade and consistent. My favorite is the smoke salmon in the shape of a fish!"
,,,,,Fast. Efficient. Friendly staff! The line looks long but it goes by super quickly! There's menus posted throughout the line to encourage you to know what you want to order ahead of time. The smoked salmon pate is out of this world!!!
,,,,,Hard to beat fresh baked goods. Add on some yummybsweet and savory items. All around a recipe for success.
,,,,,Some items are better than others. Really would suggest going with your gut on what sounds good to you. 
,,,,,I found the rice chicken curry puff to be great.
,,,,,"Super crowded. Very small place but they have some of the nicest people I've met at pike market. I got three piroshky but I forgot to take a picture of the chicken, curry and rice piroshky but after like 3 bites I threw it away. It was Hella nasty but flakey bread. The cranberry apple roll was amazing. Now that I'm thinking about it I should have got 2 of them. I will be going back before my trip us over. I take that back my favorite one was the apple cinnamon roll. Can you say OMG I don't know how they did it."
,,,,,Yum!!! Highly recommend. Fresh and fun and delicious. Get the salmon one if you haven't been. My husband and I loved it.
,,,,,"This is a true-to-style, traditional Piroshky bakery. Always fresh and reminiscent of my grandma's from years ago. Thanks for existing!"
,,,,,*Pre-Covid review*
,,,,,Came to Prioshky Prioshky as a recommended place to try. There was a short line in front of the story and was super excited. The store front is quite tight and a bit overwhelming because there's a line behind. We asked them for a recommended one and they suggested the beef. 
,,,,,"Their beef prioshky was good in flavor. There was a good meat ratio. I believe if it wasn't cold, it would taste much better. It rang up to ~$7 for a prioshky. Next time I visit Seattle, I would still visit and try another flavor."
,,,,,"Unplanned gem we decided to give it a shot and stand in line. Amazing piroshkies! So good we came back the next morning (weekday mornings, no line!). This is one of those tourist traps that are def worth it."

,,,,,"I am a big fan of ethnic food and this hits the spot despite its tourist trap location. I was like a lot of you, skeptical at first. HOwever, after I smelled the aromatic scent of butter and bread, i had to get one to see if it is a total waste of my calories intake or worth it. Well, it turns out, it is worth it! "
,,,,,"It has flaky and butter crust, and is filled with savory gravy and meat for my meat pie. They have sweet flavor ones too so there is something for everyone! It is pretty tiny and mainly for takeout. If you come during peak hours, there will be a long line out the door. Luckily, I only come when it is still early in the day to get the first dip. Get it and you won't regret it!"
,,,,,"The line gets long but moves pretty quickly. I had the beef and cheese, it was so tasty. It's worth the wait and it was filling."
,,,,,I LOVE Piroshky Piroshky. 
,,,,,I've never had such great pastries (are they considered pastries?) in my life. The variety and the flavor are unmatched. 
,,,,,"My favorites are the Cheddar Garlic Roll and the Ham/Cheese/Spinach pastry, but you really can't go wrong with any of their options. If you take them home, be sure to microwave them for 30 seconds so their nice and warm!"
,,,,,Also a big fan of their delivery service that they've started doing in the past year since I previously lived out of state. 
,,,,,"If you're visiting in person, be sure to come during the day - since they bake a certain amount, some pastries might not be available closer to the evening but I believe they do BOGO 50% off in the evenings as well."
,,,,,Thank you Andy -  We love visiting California. -we are up for a visit next week!
,,,,,It's a tiny store and line is always long! It's worth the wait. Tried the smoked salmon pate and beef with cheese. Salmon was not fishy. I wish they put more salmon in there. Beef and cheese tastes like Chinese food. I like this store more than the French bakery next door ;)
,,,,,"Came here twice in a recent trip to Seattle- the first time was near closing on Memorial Day so walked in without a line.  It's easy to miss this store but normally you would see a big line outside.  One customer/family inside at a time- you can see the food items and there are signs outside so you can figure out your order in advance.  If you buy 8 you get a stamp card for one free and you get out the food in a nice yellow reusable tote.  My favorite are the beef and onion, beef and cheddar, and smoked salmon.  The potato based ones I found to be more bread and dry.  The sweet piroshkys were good too- had the hazelnut and rhubarb."
,,,,,"Went during Memorial Day weekend, 2021 as a first timer. The line was long, but not as long as the original Starbucks line that was next door. The woman who was working the line outside assured the customers the line went fast and it did. Waited about 15-20 minutes max and was in and out with my items. The salmon was the best; it was hot and fresh. The garlic cheese roll was just that, nothing more nothing less, but still enjoyed every bite. My tastebuds did not agree with the cinnamon cardamon. I took a bite and then another to make sure I was done and I was indeed done. I learned I am not a fan of cardamon."
,,,,,"Their salmon pate Piroshky is probably one of the best things you can go out of your way to try in Seattle in its price range. Very delicious - not everything in their repertoire will be quite as good but I don't think there's anything you can get here that will be *bad.* Not much more I can say about it that hasn't been said already by many others; have ordered bundles of their pastries in a ""bake at home"" style and it was fun to try, made for a very filling dinner."
,,,,,I love this place and I wish I can eat the salmon piroshky everyday but I live in NY. I had the salmon piroshky 3 days in a row when I was visiting Seattle. They heat up really well after being placed in the fridge. I also had the beef and cheese and the potato flavor but is not as good as salmon!!
,,,,,"Yum! Definitely recommend stopping by here if you're in need of a little snack. The line may look long, but the have it managed well and it moves extremely quickly. I ordered the a few sweet pastries and they were excellent! My favorite was the Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll. Be prepared to get a little sticky when eating these!"
,,,,,Always fantastic and friendly! The perfect pick me up comfort food on the go. Very conveniently located In Pike place Market.
,,,,,"I'm at the market at least 3 days a week, I always have to stop in and get a salmon Piroshky, or if I'm having a bit of a sweet tooth one of their sweet options. Quick and friendly service by the staff, even when they're slammed or having a rude customer. When ever I have people come see me I make this a must stop for a munchy on the go!"

,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a super popular bakery in Pike Place Market, and it definitely lived up to the hype. The line at the store was super long on a Saturday afternoon, but we moved pretty quickly so we only waited for maybe thirty minutes. We ordered three of their bestselling piroshky - Potato & Cheese, Smoked Salmon Pate, and Apple Cinnamon Roll. Our pastries came right out of the oven, so they were super warm and fresh. The savory piroshky were so delicious - the pastry was incredibly flaky, and the fillings were perfectly flavored. The Apple Cinnamon Roll was also quite tasty; I really enjoyed the fresh apples and cinnamon flavor. Piroshky Piroshky was definitely worth the wait!"
,,,,,Went last Sunday night @ 625 pm they were closed ! Yelp says they close at 7pm . Real bummer I was hoping to try before I left Seattle
,,,,,I love this place!  Ok...line looks long but it goes by so quickly.  They get you in and out.  My suggestion if you only want to try one or two is the beef and onion...which is like the best burger you have ever had...and the salmon.  Follow that with a Hazelnut sweet...wow...so good.  Otherwise try all of them!! It's super affordable and getting one of each is cheap and you can feed an entire family :).  High marks for friendly people running the shop...they go fast but they don't make you feel foolish if you can't decide.  Go here!!
,,,,,"Amazing and unique pastries. Skip the typical French bakery down the blcok and try this place! The actual shop is just a counter where you order and take your pastries to go. I really enjoyed how fresh the pastries were, all the ones we had were still warm. You could see the employees making more pastries in the window! You can not go wrong here, Savory or Sweet they are all delicious. I will be looking for a place like this near me. I fear I will think of these pastries and never find anything that compares."
,,,,,"These were just ok. We got the two traditional ones; potato and beef and a potato and onion. The potato and beef was in a croissant like flaky pastry crust, but it was soaking wet with grease. Not for me. The potato and onion one was in a tougher dough, that was easier to eat but the flavor was off for me. The dough is slightly sweet and the filling is bland. A very strange combination overall. I'd recommend saving your stomach space and pick something else up while you're downtown."
,,,,,No pictures but it is fast super fresh and delicious
,,,,,More than one location .
,,,,,But we loved all 6 items we got
,,,,,"Super friendly, super quick and really great Gaston food. The ham and spinach was really salty, but that's the nature of ham.... My husband said the salmon was the best pastry he'd ever eaten."
,,,,,"We heard a lot of great things about this place so we wanted to check it out. The line was long but moved very quickly! The person in charge of the line was super effective at facilitating it so that not too many people crowded the ordering area. The food itself was delicious. We ordered a variety of fillings from the beef and onion filling to the curry filling. For myself, I had the pirozhki with salmon pate filling. It was very delicious! I liked how the bread was much lighter and fluffier than I expected and enjoyed how it complemented the pate. Personally, I felt I could have eaten at least half another pirozhki to have a complete meal. In the future, I'd like to try the other types of pirozhkis offered."
,,,,,Piroshky piroshky is a Russian bakery located in the Pike Place Market. It's very popular. And they have yummy stuff. You can watch them make piroshky. A piroshky is stuffed pie. You have lots of choices. They're good kind of warm.
,,,,,We stopped by this spot a few years ago when we visited Seattle. It's one of the stores you need to stop by and check it out as a tourist when you are in town. The place is across from the famous fish market; and you probably won't miss it due to always a long line outside. We ordered the famous apple pastry and it's good and comforting!!! Recommend

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Great Pastries! Nice little bakery in Pikes Place, I liked the beef and cheese pastry, a bit under seasoned but nevertheless good! Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,"we were  around downtown Seattle looking for something to eat. I apoyted this place so we went to check it out. The line was long, but the food was worth it. I had a potato and cheese piroahky that was delicious. The price was very good. I high recommend this place."
,,,,,"Let me just make this clear...I come here EVER DAY when I visit Seattle. I cannot get over these. The perfectly fluffy bread, the tender and flavorful fillings. The line could wrap all the way to 3rd Avenue and I would wait. I would eat these beautiful meat pies for every meal if I could!!"
,,,,,"Quick bites at this spot throughout our visit since the line was long but moved fast. Our favorite was the salmon Pate since it was unexpectedly delicious. I thought both Pate and salmon were strong by themselves individually, and to combine them would be a clash of flavors, but boy were I dead wrong. The texture was soft, velvety, and somehow just worked beautifully. We've been back a few times already for the salmon Pate alone."
,,,,,"Visited 8/24, despite the long line, they have menus posted along the way so that the ordering process goes by fast. They have both dessert and food types, which all are good. They are reasonably priced and made fresh. We purchased a variety of them and enjoyed them all. Would definitely come back next time we are in Washington."
,,,,,"If you go, get the curry filled pastry. 10/10 would eat again.  I'm coming back for a sweet version next time."
,,,,,This place is spiritual. Favorite stop to bring visiting friends to in the market. Get the smoked salmon piroshy you will not be disappointed!!
,,,,,"Tiny place with big, awesome smells! We were second in line when they opened and were blown away by the Potato and cheese, Veggie chipotle and Cherries and cream--heavenly!! Only made better by eating them at the picnic tables on the waterfront."
,,,,,"The fact that I had a layover in Seattle, hopped on the Link train, walked to the market, just to buy a couple Piroshky's should say it all. Just about every time we have feet on the ground in Seattle, we head down for a beef and onion, chicken curry, breakfast Piroshky with hashbrowns, eggs, meat and cheese... Ok you get the point. The biggest issue I have is that my shirt gets covered with the flaky crust and I always want just one more."
,,,,,"Long lines on the weekends! Try to go during the weekdays if you can! Made fresh daily! Loved all the ones I tried! The Marzipan definitely has great almond flavors, but not too sweet. My favorite was the potato and cheese piroshsky. Bread was soft and fluffy and the fillings were flavorful! Highly recommend it!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"A must try when in Pike Place! You've probably heard of Piroshky Piroshky before or seen pictures somewhere of their yummy baked goods. They're famous for great tasting treats! I've made trips into Seattle just for the salmon one, they're well worth it."
,,,,," To my surprise they even have a happy hour in the afternoon, who doesn't love a dea!? I can't remember what time it was and I asked before to make sure, the person helping me had to double check too so just call and ask or ask while your there and you may get a deal! "
,,,,,"I can't emphasize enough, TRY THE SALMON ONE. Not only does it look like a salmon but its savory and oh so good. I also tried the cinnamon twist one on my last trip and it was another delicious choice! there's options for everyone."
,,,,,"Beef and Onion, Smoked Salmon Patê, Chicken Sausage, Garlic Cheese Roll. "
,,,,,They were all good. Kind of pricey but I enjoyed everything. Will come back to try others next time.
,,,,,"I knew I had to try this place after every single blog, list and must do about Seattle said to check them out. We waited in a short line before being able to enter. Originally the potato and cheese one we wanted was out for the day so we opted for the onion and potato instead. "
,,,,,"It was just okay. I think I was disappointed my first choice wasn't available. The dough was nice and soft and flavorful, but the filling was just alright. I felt like it was way too much dough compared to the filling. "
,,,,,I think if I ever went back I'd go early enough to get my first choice or maybe a sweet option instead. I'd say they're still worth trying!
,,,,,"3.5 stars. I ordered the vegan potato and mushroom piroshky and my friend ordered the salmon pâté piroshky. It was good but nothing super special. As of 2022, they have 3 vegan options: Impossible Beef, Potato and Mushroom, and Veggie Chipotle. Make sure you eat it while it's hot!"
,,,,,"Classic Pike Place institution with a line out the door pre-covid, but 100% worth it. Try the salmon piroshky... It's so flavorful, you won't regret it. These piroshky are very hearty and quite rich, so definitely more of an occasional treat."
,,,,,"I'll let you in on a secret though... There's another one of these right on 3rd and Pine, by the McDonald's. A little bit of a seedy location sure, but you'll skip the line completely and it's only a few blocks over"
,,,,,"you already know this is another must try when visiting pikes place  they have a great selection to choose from and i wish I could've tried them all. Their smoked salmon pate is a fan fave and so delicious! The filling is perfectly blended with cream cheese, dill & onion. "
,,,,,"in addition to hand pies, they serve sweet pastries, as well. we tried their apple cinnamon roll, which was just as tasty. it had a good amount of sweetness, and it would taste even better just slightly warmed! "
,,,,,"we went during a weekday in November and although there was a line, they are very efficient and didn't have to wait very long."
,,,,,"Worth the wait...in the snow. If you are in the area, this place is perfect for a light snack. Best to come here early or later in the day as line gets long."
,,,,,"We ordered x1 Beef and Cheese, x1Potato and Mushroom, and x1 Cinnamon and Cardamom Braid. All piping hot and delicious. "
,,,,,Male patron advised us they come and ship to the Bay Area x2 a month. Gonna have to drive to SF for these bad boys again.
,,,,,"I really loved these, and my family did too -- so much that we came here twice within the same day (for breakfast and dinner). The only thing is that the price is slightly high for a pastry, but the fillings are substantial. We tried most of the savory flavors and the apple cinnamon roll and they were all good."
,,,,,"These are flakey and dense patties stuffed with anything and everything. They're definitely fairly priced and large enough that you could get away with eating just one if you weren't hungry. We couldn't decide so we got the salmon (which is just ad good as the reviews hyped it up to be), the beef and onion, potato and cheese, and marzipan. My favorites were the salmon and potato and cheese however the other 2 were my partners favorite. The lines get ling however they try hard to keep it moving. I would wait in line again, if that says anything."
,,,,,"Take a trip to Pikes Place just for this little gem. We always get their potato and cheese piroshki and cinnamon cardamom braid. They have specials sometimes on their menu. Yes, there will always be a long line. But you can be assured that the wait will be worth it."

,,,,,"My adventurous husband wanted to try this place and the line was crazzzzzy long but he waited. Surprisingly it went quickly and when he took a bite out of his meet and cheese patty, he was in heaven! He went back the next day and got a potato with cheese patty and sweet patty and although he liked them all, his favorite was still the meet and cheese!"

,,,,,This place was just ok. Definitely getting the pike place rub to have such high reviews. We went back a second time to be sure we didn't like it because it seems so popular with the tourists and they always have a long line. We are sure.
,,,,,"There are so many pastries to choose from at Piroshy Piroshky. Most are decent, but the smoked salmon pate absolutely rises to the top. I wish we bought an extra to save for breakfast the next day. "
,,,,,"Everything else here is fine. The bacon, egg and hashbrown sounds amazing, but missing the wow factor you'd expect from a place with this much hype. We liked the chicken curry with rice a little better, but it's not a must-order either."
,,,,,"The best part is that the line moves at a really good clip, and your order comes hot and fast. If you're trying a few things at Pike Place, start here and enjoy your bread while in line at Beecher's or Pike Place Chowder."
,,,,,I remember when they opened! I was working in the Columbia tower and they were handing out free introductory samples. 
,,,,,Something unique from uniquely special folks! I am thrilled know they are still going strong.
,,,,,Support them!
,,,,,"I do not understand all the hype and why the line is so long at Piroshky, Piroshky.  Of course I had to try it because I was a tourist.  I did not like the ham, cheese, spinach piroshky and the apple cinnamon roll looked delicious, but it was very dry.  My husband usually eats anything because he is not picky.  Even he did not like the items."
,,,,,"Oh well...been there, done that!"
,,,,,Fove stars for their salmon piroshok!
,,,,,I tried a few and if I had to rank them it would be:
,,,,,1. Salmon! I came back the next day to get some more if these.
,,,,,2. Cinnamon cardamon braid
,,,,,3. Moscow roll
,,,,,4. I don't remeber the name but it was some with spricy sausage
,,,,,5. Apple roll
,,,,,"Also, they have happy hour 6pm-7pm. Buy one get one 50% off."
,,,,,"I simply love this place.  Oh, the storefront isn't so much except it is set in a historic setting right across from the Public Market just off the water front. They have no place to sit down and enjoy that which they offer, but who cares? This food is meant to be enjoyed in the comfort of one's home so take away from Piroshky Piroshky is the way to go.  But the best thing is that, even in Cedar Park, Tx I can get a Piroshky or several delivered to me.  That's right, Piroshky Piroshky has gone somewhat national.  They will be making a fresh delivery to my neck of the woods in Nov. and I fully plan on ordering some of their delights. "
,,,,,Check out their website for possible deliveries in your town. 
,,,,,"This place had some really amazing pastries (both sweet and savory), I wish I could eat here all the time."
,,,,,Came here because my best friend suggested it. My husband got the bacon Hash brown and I got the jalapeno sausage with cheese. So good! Super quick and a lot of choices. Very good street food
,,,,,"This place is usually my FIRST stop when I get to the Market. I've tried to time my visits to when the line would be short but the food is so good, the line is usually wrapped down the street anyway."
,,,,,"Still, worth the wait! Get in line. You won't be sorry."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Line was long but so worth the wait. Numerous vegetarian and vegan options also. Tried the beef and cheese, potato and cheese, and chocolate cream hazelnut. All would come back for. Nice and hot and all were constantly being reloaded. The best was their monthly dessert or sour cherry and cream. Would come back over and over for it."
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky is beyond solid.
,,,,,"I wouldn't say this is anything I would go out of the way for, but if you're near one, there's some good value here considering the ingredients inside them. "
,,,,,"Don't know what a Piroshky is? It's probably between a croissant and a danish with superior filing.  There are LOADS of filling choices to be had and as long as the line can be, it's pretty quick.  When I was there, we were encouraged by a runner to scan the QR code for the menu so we knew what to order when going up, and they'd warn us what was gone ahead of time."
,,,,,"Don't expect much in the way of social distancing though.  The line gets pretty tight mainly because it's right next to the original Starbucks and some other place I'm forgetting.  It's Pike's Place, so if you're not used to crowds yet, you probably shouldn't be coming here."
,,,,,"Again, not anything I'd typically crave, but something you wouldn't regret buying when you're here."
,,,,,I've come before and was not a fan of the meat breads but for this trip I tried the Marzapan..all I can say is I'm inlove! Will be coming back just for this bread:)
,,,,,"Delicious, but they need to add staffing or an additional location; the line is too long (and the costs are fairly pricy also)."
,,,,,"Good place, good service, and good piroshky! "
,,,,,"I ordered a ton of them (over 10), so my apologies for not being able to recite them all. Off the op of my head are the corned beef, and the mushroom and potato. "
,,,,,"My favorite were the beef and onion, beef and cheese, and then the smoked salmon pate. These stood out because of the strong flavors and a good filling to bread ratio. Don't go cheap on me! "
,,,,,"The rest of the food I ordered didn't leave very memorable impressions, as you might have noticed by my lack of recollection. Just lacking in flavor and that BAM, ya know?"
,,,,,"I came on a weekday around noon and there wasn't much of a wait. The price was decent. And so was the food! All in all, worth a try, once :) I might come back again for the beef and onion or cheese piroshky!"
,,,,,"A bit of a tourist trap, with an exceedingly average product. The piroshky--which I've been spelling as pirojki; good thing Yelp search corrected it for me!--was okay, but could have been more flavourful."
,,,,,"We got the Beef & Cheese and the Smoked Salmon Pâté. Both smelled great and were very pretty to look at, but ultimately tasted... bland and yet salty at the same time? The flavours were not particularly complex; the piroshkys were heavy and filling, and quite rich besides, but in the end I don't think I'll go back."
,,,,,I think I'll stick to getting pirojki in less touristy areas.
,,,,,Long line for sure but fast moving and worth it. Tried several things but my fave would have to be the salmon.
,,,,,"Salmon pate was something else! Warm and fluffy. The salmon was delicious. Well even tried the apple cinnamon roll, so good! Does not disappoint!"
,,,,,"Mushroom/potato piroshky is a great snack to start (or end?) your day. Reasonably priced. Line might seems long, but employees are moving it pretty fast."
,,,,,"You can't NOT eat at Piroshky Piroshky. It may not be within my diet in the least bit, but one simply cannot help just how good these darn things are. "
,,,,,"Fresh, perfectly cooked dough, both sweet and savory options. You really can't go wrong. "
,,,,,"Word to the wise - if you are stuck in line in their main location at Pike Market, go up the street to 3rd where they have a small kiosk. You'll thank me later. They also have a food truck that makes its rounds in the area like the SODO wine blocks. "
,,,,,"Faves: Beef & Cheese, Beef & Onion, or Smoked Salmon. Large enough for a meal or something to tide you over while pursuing the market. "
,,,,,"I don't usually opt for their sweet versions, but their apple tart is delicious :)"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"good food. line moves quickly. kinda pricey, but worth it every now and then. "
,,,,,good place to go when in pike place.
,,,,,"We got piroshkies from their pop-up in San Francisco. A friend did the oick-up for us so I can't comment on the process. We ordered 3 savory and 3 sweet piroshkies. The beef & onion was really tasty and had a nice flaky dough. We enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately the chicken pot pie and the beef & potato were both quite bland. The cranberry apple sweet piroshky seemed to have some raw dough despite us heating it in the oven for 18 minutes (from the refrigerator). The Moscow was pretty good. The marzipan was good but super sweet...a tad too sweet. I can't say I would go out of my way to order more but if it were conveniently available, I'd order only the beef & onion and the Moscow."
,,,,,Best Piroshky's in town.
,,,,,"(It's just so popular, hard to get in these days - so send someone in your party to wait in line with your order. )"
,,,,,"Every article about what to eat when visiting Seattle included Piroshky Piroshky, so of course, we had to try it!! I heard lines can be extremely long here, but I thankfully only waited about 5-10 minutes! They are extremely efficient, getting people in and out and getting people their orders right away!"
,,,,,"They have so many options, but I ordered the beef and cheese as it was one of their most popular items. Although I thought it was good, it wasn't the amazing goodness that I was hoping for. The beef and cheese filling just probably wasn't my thing, so I definitely wish I got to try other flavors!! I really enjoyed the bread though! I kind of squeezed out some of the filling so I could eat more of the bread haha."
,,,,,"I can totally see what the hype is for this place and the next time I visit, I would definitely like to try something else!"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky is a must when you're visiting Seattle for the first time. There are multiple locations throughout Seattle if you can't stand the lines at the Pike Place location. 
,,,,,Piroshky is a Russian bakery that has a plethora of pastries to pick from. You can choose between having a savory or sweet piroshky. 
,,,,,Some of my personal favorites are: 
,,,,,- Beef & Cheese 
,,,,,- Smoked Salmon Pate 
,,,,,- Apple Cinnamon Roll 
,,,,,- Cinnamon Cardamom Braid
,,,,,I didn't read about this place beforehand but was immediately drawn in by the smell (incredibly enticing and I did leave the Starbucks reserve line to stand in this line instead). I got a Salmon Piroshky to eat immediately and took an Apple Cinnamon Roll to go! 
,,,,,"It was all delicious but unfortunately gave me a bit of a stomach ache afterwards  overall, was definitely worth it, and the staff the extremely nice and helpful"
,,,,,"Absolutely delicious every time. We came back three times over our trip just to try everything. I highly recommend any of the piroshkies with meat, and of course try the salmon pate one. It's crispy on the outside, hot, fresh."
,,,,,Who doesn't stop by Piroshky Piroshky when at the Market?!? 
,,,,,"I don't know if it's the fresh baked bread or the savory, perfectly seasoned vegetables inside make it melt in your mouth good!! The crew has an efficient social distancing foordering, and they move extremely fast. I highly suggest taking a look at the menu prior to entering because there will be little time for you inquire about the available selections."
,,,,,It's the perfect meal for anyone who loves really good food; and I highly recommend!!

,,,,,"This place was recommended to me by a local in Portland, while giving me pointers of places to visit during my stay. "
,,,,,It's located right on Pike's Place Market next to several other amazing food related shops
,,,,,"There was a (very organized) line right out the door, not surprising though, as you can smell the warm goodies and you can see the handmade process from right outside *.*"
,,,,,"Knowing I was there, I for sure was going to order more than one thing, just to have for to-go and breakfast the next day "
,,,,,"The staff is very friendly, quick and efficient in everything, including recommendations to their fresh baked goodies "
,,,,,"Ordered 3 pastries in total: Smoked Salmon Pate, Cheddar and cheese Garlic Roll and a Spinach pastry that I forgot to take a foto of... "
,,,,,"They were all very well made, somehow can tell they were handmade, also very nicely buttery. The stuffing ratio to the carb/bread/pastry portions are just right and nicely balanced. "
,,,,,Spent about $19-20 for 3 (large) pastries that I snacked on through the rest of the day and had the Cheddar till for breakfast at the hotel. 
,,,,,Was so tempted to go back for the Smoked Salmon Pate pastry but will definitely come back in future trips 
,,,,,Highly recommend!
,,,,,"Made my first stop into this location this afternoon when at Pike Place. I was excited to see some piroshkys fresh out of the oven and got one. The smoked salmon was fresh out of the oven and was delish- i could barely get my son to share with me. I also got one that was mushroom, broccoli and mozzarella and another that had sausage and other things? They were all great but the salmon one is the best."
,,,,,"I appreciated that they took social distancing seriously and we're having 1 group in the small shop at a time. The food was great but the shop itself was I bit dingy- not the cleanest looking, but I didn't mind since it was the kind of place where you grab your food and eat elsewhere."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Be 'prebread' to wait stand in a queue outside to get your fix of Piroshky. Since it's a bakery-style spot, the line goes by super fast, just make sure you know what you want to order before hand. I ordered the highly recommended salmon pie which was good but I enjoyed the beef one way more! They'll see me again before I leave Seattle :)"
,,,,,"Nice experience! While waiting in line, the store lady gave welcome and warm kind of promotion and also gave kind notice on flights (since American Airlines were canceling flights over the weekend. Luckily my flight didn't get cancelled.). "
,,,,,The order process was fast. I think I spent ~15mins for the line and 30 sec for actually ordering and taking foods. 
,,,,,Piroshkies are delicious. Take them home and warmed them up in the oven myself. The flavor is still there. It was the last day of monthly special (beef and kimchi).
,,,,,"Pikes Place must-stop.  Actually, it's across from the market vendor area.  We watched (as we were in line) them creating pastries in the tiny spot.  Only one customer in the store due to Covid precautions."
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle, Piroshky Piroshky is a MUST. Dont let the long line discourage you, it moves really fast! This was my first time trying a Piroshky and I am so impressed by the flaky outer pastry that houses the delicious inner filling. "
,,,,,"Chicken Curry and Rice: 10/10. The chicken curry and rice were delicious and savory. The curry flavor was nice and strong, and the outer pastry didn't get soggy despite the filling! "
,,,,,"Bacon, Egg, Hash Brown: 10/10. Perfect blend of the classic breakfast flavors. "
,,,,,"Ham, cheese, and spinach: 9/10. Absolutely delicious. I personally like extremely strong spices, and I believe this could have had a stronger flavor which is why I took off -1. However, it was still so good! "
,,,,,"Orange: 6/10. The flavor was very good; the classic pastry and a pleasant orange flavor. However, the filling was a gooey marshmallow-like texture, which I am personally not a fan of. "
,,,,,"Overall, Piroshky Piroshky now has a special place in my heart and I will always carve out time for this place if I'm  in Washington! The pastries are generously sized and are SO satisfying."
,,,,,"Yes, yes and yes!"
,,,,,"A wide selection of danishes, croissant type items, turnovers, pierogis........  all appear to be homemade.  Tried a few items and all were delish."
,,,,,The original Starbucks location is a few doors down so get you coffee there.
,,,,,"Being a Pole who loves pierogi, I thought it fitting to try a Piroshki or two or four..."
,,,,,for research purposes.
,,,,,"I ordered the breakfast-hash brown , the ham-spinach-cheese and the beef mushroom."
,,,,,"Verdict:  Easy to eat on the fly, tasty and unusual."
,,,,,"Score: That's two ""Bosh moi!"", a ""Vkusnyye"" and a ""Spasiba."""
,,,,,I was a Seattle Visitor and knew I had to come here based on the reviews I had read. There are a few locations but I went to the Pike's Place one. 
,,,,,"Food: We got the fresh rhubarb piroshki. There was a nice lady serving and I asked her what ""Piroshky"" means and she said its equivalent to ""pie"". I had never had rhubarb dessert in my life and I was pleasantly surprised. I loved this rhubarb piroshky! We went early morning and it made for a perfect breakfast. Right next to this place is the 1st Starbucks in the world but I decided to support a small business rather than a large corporation. "
,,,,,"Ambiance: It's not a restaurant. Its a small hole-in-the-wall that can barely hold two people. You go in, order, and leave. It's a grab-and-go kind of place."
,,,,,Its weird to never review this place as it's iconic to Seattle. But there's always a line pre-covid so I never bothered. But right now was a good opportunity to see what the hype is!
,,,,,I did a group order with my group and decided to try the beef and onion piroshki. The order was easy and I got my food on time. The piroshki was very filling. It looks small but it's packed with yummy goodness in each pastry. I ate one and that filled me up till dinner! I love the flakiness of the pastry and then comes the packed beef and onion inside. 
,,,,,Definitely makes your money worth and its also an easy grab and go while you are exploring. They also have a punch card where you buy 8 and you get 1 free so that's nice! Will be back to try their sweet options next time!
,,,,,Omg!  This place is incredible!  My stomach is growling while thinking about a piroshky!  I'm sad that we don't have a place like this in MN!  
,,,,,"I found out about this place from my cousin who lived in Seattle. It is right outside of the marketplace and if I wasn't looking for it, I wouldn't have found it. Search for them and visit!"
,,,,,"They have a wide assortment of pastries for both the savory and sweet. We tried the potato and cheese piroshky, cheddar cheese and garlic roll and the beef and onion. We ate them so fast and they were surprisingly filling too. We got a lemon one to go for later and it was also incredible.  You can't go wrong here!  Grab one for me if you live in MN! Hahah... not joking. :)"
,,,,,Had the salmon pate. It was flakey and very flavorful. I will definitely be coming back to try the others!
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Delicious! They have 2 vegan options and they both were great. When the line is on the longer side, it goes by pretty quickly. I'd absolutely say it's worth stopping by and getting something. They hold up well in the fridge to be reheated the next day as well."
,,,,,"The dough that goes into these pastries is incredible. Supple yet crispy. Flaky but a bite to it . You will certainly feel full. The people of Piroshky got it down to a science, so even long lines don't last that long. I do wish the veggie savory pastries were more hot, the meat ones were nice and warm inside. The salmon pate one is the one to try ! I also recommend the potato cheese one."
,,,,,Love this spot whenever I come into town!! Honestly it's usually always crowded but with the pandemic going on it was really painless to grab some goodies togo. 
,,,,,My favorite is the smoked salmon pate but honestly all of them are pretty good! 
,,,,,"Pro tip: if you're taking it back with you in a flight, pop it in the air fryer back home and it tastes good as new!"
,,,,,My daughter and I were full after visiting several eateries in Pike Place but Piroshky Piroshky is insanely popular so we had to try them. There was a small line that moved fast to get in. Once we entered the store we were greeted in a friendly manner. 
,,,,,They had so many beautiful sweet Piroshkys displayed but we decided to go with a savory treat. We ordered the salmon Piroshky and it was absolutely delicious. The filling was amazing. The fresh dill in the filling enhanced the salmon flavor. The crust was buttery and flaky.
,,,,,"Giving this place 4 stars for variety. Wasn't a huge fan of all the choices I got, but definitely curious to try the rest. I did love the salmon one and would love to stop by again and snack on some variety of piroshkies. Although the line was long, it definitely moved quick. Hats off to the staff that really got the line moving and we're just fantastic at their job."
,,,,,"The chicken curry rice and the beef/onion are a must try!  I wish I could have tried more, but I am only one person.  The line may seem long, but it moves rather quickly.  You can see the pastries being made as you wait in line, which is pretty impressive.  Highly recommend trying these savory delights."
,,,,,"10/10 amazing, highly recommend smoked salmon pate, one of my favorite places in Seattle to grab a quick lunch"
,,,,,"We kept seeing these yellow bags all around pike place, so glad to finally figure out where they were from. "
,,,,,We tried the beef and onion and the chicken curry piroshkys and they were delicious.
,,,,,Loved it! We first visited here on a food tour we took.  We were given samples of the Salmon Pate. It was really good.  Lines are long on the weekend so we decided to go back during the week.  We went back before leaving to head to airport.  I got a beef & cheese as well as a curry chicken & rice.  Both were very good... wish I had gotten more.
,,,,,"LOVED their salmon piroshky!! The line was long when I got there, however it goes very fast and the food is worth it! Would definitely go back!!"
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,The smoked salmon is my favorite savory choice. The almond filled is my favorite sweet choice!
,,,,,"Stopped for a quick bite to eat while in the area. Got a smoked salmon pate and the bread was soft with a crisp outer layer, the inside filling was hot but there could be more of it. Also got a Moscow roll was expecting it to be filled with cream but it seems like the cream was blended into the bread itself and didn't have a very strong taste. Overall okay for a quick snack just wished the pastries had more filling inside."
,,,,,Got the cheese and potato piroshky! Soooo delicious and hit the spot! I really liked their rhubarb dessert as well.
,,,,,Thank you Kirtana - We will be visiting California with PRE ORDER only   POP-UPs this month- we help  to bring other business to California as well - please let your family and friends know so they can get their fix! 
,,,,,A really yummy Russian bakery with pierogis and sweet treats! There's always a large line but it's worth the wait. It's right in Pike Place Market and there's lots of really awesome options to choose from. 
,,,,,"I got the mushroom and potato pierogi as well as potato and cheese pierogi for a savory dish -- both are super yummy! The potato and cheese is a must-have filled with carb-y goodness. I also got the cinnamon apple roll which was made with the freshest apples. Overall, super yummy and filling!"
,,,,,"Great sweet and savory buns for cheap. If you're looking to avoid the lines, skip their Pike Place location and check out one of the many others around town."
,,,,,Wow ..... must eat 
,,,,,Value for $$ 5/5
,,,,,Taste 5/5
,,,,,Quality 5/5
,,,,,Time to serve 5/5
,,,,,Ease of ordering and service 5/5
,,,,,"Stopped by Piroshky Piroshky during a visit to the Market. We went on a Friday afternoon so the market itself wasn't terribly busy, but there was still a line for this place. The line wasn't too bad, I think we waited about half an hour? And I think it looks longer than it is, due to the fact that only one party goes inside at a time."
,,,,,"Definitely recommend the salmon piroshky and the beef/onion one. The others we tried (potato/egg, egg/bacon, desserts) were only average, but those two were top notch."
,,,,,"I've been here several times and they don't disappoint. The beef and onion is the best savory pastry they have. Perfect puff pastry, amazing filling. The marzipan pastry is really good too, I only wish it was made with the same puff pastry as the beef and onion! The staff is very nice and friendly too. There is regularly a line now that the weather is nicer but if you go during off times it's not bad."
,,,,,"Stopped by for a few fresh pastries. We bought more than we planned but they were so good. They were making more of the apple roll while we were in line. Also saw the baker pulling many fresh items right from the oven. Getting warm, fresh pastries was a nice treat."
,,,,,I waited 30 minutes in line in the freezing cold to finally be able to order what I want and it was worth every second. I didn't even know this was a popular bakery spot until my husband mentioned it to me and was like we need to grab some pastries from here. It's a very small bakery shop so only one customer can fit inside and order at a time and they don't allow anyone else inside due to safety. 
,,,,,"I would say they had about 10-12 pastries to choose from maybe less. At first I didn't know what to get but I ended up ordering the Marzipan, Apple Roll (forgot the actual name), cheese roll, chocolate/hazelnut roll and the Moscow roll. I might be wrong with the names but oh my lord was the Marzipan and Moscow rolls the best pastries I've ever tried in my entire life. The marzipan had this strong almond filling which was divine and the Moscow roll was this sweet vanilla filling. I just can't explain how good these were. I wasn't a big fan of the Apple roll I felt like it was too bulky and plain. The chocolate/hazelnut roll my husband devoured and left none for me to try but I don't blame him it's addicting."
,,,,,The cheese roll is surely a perfect savory snack which I was not in the mood for but don't get me wrong it was really good.
,,,,,I loved loved loved their pastries and I hope I can find a bakery shop as similar in my hometown. Highly recommend and the lines go by fast so don't get discouraged from waiting.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I've always heard good things about Piroshky Piroshky, so I had to try it! We arrived at 11am and there were already twenty people in line. We got the beef & cheese, bacon hash brown egg & cheese and uli's jalapeño cheddar sausage. My favorite was the beef & cheese because it was very flavorful and quite comparable to an empanada."
,,,,,"Thanks for the awesome review, Emily! We are glad you enjoyed our Beef and Cheese Piroshky! Come back and see us again soon. Cheers!"
,,,,,"Piroshky is a must-try ... because well, who doesn't love yummy stuff inside hot pastry filled dough (except those that suffer from celiac disease- I'm so sorry...) All choices are just okay to me but still good once in a while! I recommend the ""POTATO AND MUSHROOM"", ""GREEN ONION AND GARLIC"", and ""RHUBARB"". Time in line honestly de on the day!"
,,,,,"This is a place I always get in line for whenever I visit Seattle. It has been my routine to get a drink at the original Starbucks and then get in line here to get a warm, freshly baked savory and sweet stuffed bread goodness. The salmon pate and the marzipan roll are my favorites."
,,,,,Come early and you'll be surprised with how reasonable the line will be.
,,,,,"Heard this was one of the hot places to go when visiting Seattle and I agree! Although the line might be long, the food was worth it. Definitely would want to try more of their options but for sake of time and money I was only able to try the ""best"" ones. They are quick to give your order which may make you feel anxious/pressured lol but it's efficient I guess!"
,,,,,Just wow!!! 
,,,,,"We had ordered so much food & pretty much everything was delicious ..except ""potato pierogie "".. "
,,,,,They were  over boiled .
,,,,,"- with cherry , beef , sausage piroshky Were good "
,,,,,"Borscht was delicious , pelmeni was good too.. "
,,,,,over all 5* highly recommended !!!
,,,,,A lot of my friends recommended to try this Russian bakery. 
,,,,,My friends ordered the smoked salmon pate. This is one of the popular bread. I couldn't taste the salmon. I thought it tasted like cream cheese. It was ok. 
,,,,,I got the beef and cheese bread. It was really good. It was also huge. So share this if you're planning to eat more at the pike.

,,,,,"Everyone I spoke to recommended this place and it did not disappoint. I love the vibes and quick service of Piroshky. Located right next to Pike Place market, any tourist should make this place a stop on their travel plans. I ordered the salmon pate, beef and cheese, and rhubarb piroshkies, and needless to say, I ate them all before I got any pictures. Very convenient to eat (while on the move), tasty, and filling. Might I add, also very good prices for Seattle! This place is a must go."
,,,,,"I admittedly have an undying love for Piroshky Piroshky. It's legitimately one of my first stops every time I'm in Seattle. If you're extra lucky like I was when I stopped by last week on a little escape up to Seattle, your pastry could be fresh out the oven and piping hot! Truly nothing beats a nice warm Piroshky regardless of the weather and I already can't wait to go back next time I'm in Seattle."
,,,,,Food: 4.5/5
,,,,,I really really enjoyed this place at Pikes!  Loved the beef & cheese piroshky- definitely my favorite!  The salmon pate was very good as well.  Tried many of the other options but those two stand out by far.  
,,,,,Would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!!!
,,,,,I'm not entirely sure what all the hype was about. Waited in line and got a soggy dough-wrapped filling that really didn't do much for me. Maybe I caught them on a bad day but it seems like their success is a matter of location.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Hubby gives it 4.5 stars
,,,,,I give it 3.5
,,,,,Compromised at 4 stars 
,,,,,We got 7 of them total price about $50 and get got a tote bag as a promo.
,,,,,Line gets long but it's very efficient so it goes by fast. There's a couple of menus posted so you'll be able to see them while you wait.
,,,,,The smell was captivating. We were in the Starbucks line and the smell made our tummy rage 
,,,,,"The employees were very polite, quick, and were patient with us"
,,,,,We got an assortment of savory and sweet ones. My favorite was the apple one and his was the beef and onion. After a while... they all kinda tasted the same to me... but it's amazing fresh 
,,,,,I hope you get to stop by and try it for yourself!!
,,,,,I just so happen to stop by when there wasn't a line so lucky me!
,,,,,I ordered the salmon pate ($7). The fish shaped bread was cute! I really liked the baked buns but the filing was OK for me? I didn't really taste the salmon flavor because it was quite muted. I think I'll opt for potato cheese next time since that seemed much more popular.
,,,,,Delish! 
,,,,,"First time visit to Seattle for the weekend,"
,,,,,Saw the long line and had to see what it was all about .
,,,,,Got the original beef and onion and the seasonal special bbq pork .
,,,,,Original was the best with the perfect flakey crust 
,,,,,Went back again before our flight out .
,,,,,Line goes by pretty quickly.
,,,,,Highly recommend!
,,,,,"I had a friend recommend that I stop at this place for snacks while walking around Seattle on a trip there in July. This place is right in the heart of the Pike Place Market area on the main drag. There is a line outside on the street that we waited in for roughly 15-20 minutes. Since there are a lot of different options, the waiting actually gives you time to decide what you want. There was a gentleman that worked there standing by the line answering questions people had while they waited and providing recommendations of all his favorites. We ordered the Potato and Cheese, Beef and Cheese, Chocolate Hazelnut Cream Roll and and a seasonal Apple one."
,,,,,"We took our snacks to a little alleyway with tables nearby and tried each one. First, the dough is super soft and pillowy... almost like fresh yeast rolls you would get at a steakhouse. My personal favorite was the potato and cheese. It was like having cheesy mashed potatoes in a yeast roll. My husband did not enjoy this one as much but he really liked the beef and cheese one. We were told the Chocolate Hazelnut Cream would taste like Nutella but it didn't at all in my opinion. Very little chocolate and the chocolate was more of a gum paste fondant texture. Lastly, we were surprised to find the seasonal apple one we ordered was not in the bag. They accidentally gave us the Apple Cinnamon Roll instead. This was better than the chocolate but somewhat more dry than your typical cinnamon roll. It needed something wet like icing to be great. "
,,,,,All in all this is a great little touristy stop if you are visiting Seattle. Make sure you don't need to be anywhere since the line can be long. Take time to sit and enjoy the pastries.
,,,,,"My number 1 stop whenever I'm in Seattle. There's nothing like freshly baked bread stuffed with a variety of delicious food. It's quite a popular location, in the heart of Pike's Place Market. Don't fret, the lines may seem long but it goes by so fast, you'll be munching on your Piroshky in no time. I highly recommend the Potato & Cheese Piroshky. Maybe grab 2 while you're at it or you might find yourself back in line!"
,,,,,Great tourist attraction
,,,,,Service: polite and friendly
,,,,,"Food: The salmon pate piroshky is literally the only thing you need to try -- beef & onion comes next. The overall pastry had a great mouth-feel when taking each bite, like having amazing bread with even better spread."
,,,,,Worth checking out
,,,,,It was a long line when I got there at 3:30 today but it moved quickly. Everything looks delicious so I bought $34 worth of varieties. They gave me this reusable bag which I love. My favorite is the salmon pate.
,,,,,"I love how well they're enforcing Covid precautions. They only allow one party inside at a time and actually ask customers to wait outside if they don't comply. Service was quick, food is delicious. So many different options, you honestly can't go wrong!"
,,,,,I don't understand why this place is so popular and why it has a 4 star rating. 
,,,,,"We visited on Sunday afternoon. The place is VERY strict on masks. I witnessed the cashier kick out a customer for covering her nose with a scarf rather than wearing a mask, then when she found out that she was with a friend, she kicked the friend out as well without selling any piroshki to the girls. Well they didn't lose anything, in fact SAVED their money. I spent $18 on 3 different piroshki and didn't like any of them. I ordered potato and mushroom, marzipan roll, and some chicken that was not on their menu. I come from slavic family and know what piroshki taste like, these are not piroshki at all. They don't taste good at all! I ended up tossing all 3 of mine. I liked the dough but not the fillings. Maybe if they work on the seasoning of the filling to give it some taste. Also the potato is shredded, I'd recommend adding fresh mashed potatoes instead because the texture of that was weird to me. No offense guys, I just did not enjoy it."
,,,,,It's Piroshky Piroshy. You've got to make a stop when you are in town visiting. The line can be quite crazy to get through but the Piroshky was great! Considering we don't live in the area or even the state - we found it worth the wait to pick up a classic treat!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Super touristy, but super delicious. The line may look long; it moves quickly. If you want a light meal or a dessert wait in line. It is unlikely you will be disappointed."
,,,,,I had stayed at the Inn at the market
,,,,,"From my Hotel door to Piroshky Piroshky was just around the corner, decided to get Starbucks once they opened up "
,,,,,But walking closer to the corner you could smell the aroma of the bread so we had to stop and try it out
,,,,,"I read that this was a must go if you are at the market and boy where people right! The line was luckily not too long on the day I went. I got the bacon hash brown and a marzipan. They both were so delicious. The hash brown one was perfect for breakfast and had great flavors. The marzipan was packed full of delicious almond flavor. I couldn't eat the whole thing because it was very sweet and strong in flavor but I don't mean that in a bad way. It just might be a good one to split! Also just a tip, don't dilly dally in the shop!"
,,,,,Definitely a Seattle staple! The baked savory delights here are so good. I can't wait to come back and try the sweeter baked goods. 
,,,,,"I got three different baked goods: Beef & Onion, Beef & Cheese and the Fish shaped one and they were all so yummy."
,,,,,Visited this place 3 times in 2 days! There's usually a line but it goes fairly quick so def recommend trying it out because it's worth it - don't skip out on it!

,,,,,"As you can tell, I was a huge fan of their savory piroshkys. My favorite was the Uli's jalapeño and cheese sausage that I had to go back and get more! It was so flavorful and tasty *drolls*. My bf really enjoyed the beef and cheese one. "
,,,,,Def will go back when I visit Seattle again!
,,,,,We stopped by while visiting the area. There was a line but it was very well organized and moved quickly. We split a salmon one and it was delicious. Fun to try new foods. Would recommend!
,,,,,I don't even know how this place received great reviews. It is located on Pike Market convening outside. It is located next to a sandwich shop and Paris Bakery which I think a better choice than this. 
,,,,,I asked for their most popular which was the salmon pate and beef and onion. I order both and nothing tasted special. They are okay but not worth the wait or the price. Each of them cost $7 which I think it is over price. 
,,,,,The sandwich shop next door had a huge sandwich in different topping for $7.. so skip this place and spend more with the money and tastes.
,,,,,"Can I be honest? This is a cute little bakery shop. The food is good but I think is overhyped by the amount of tourism making vids/articles of the city. If you've been to Texas and had a kolache, this place will fill the void in Seattle"
,,,,,I always get a fresh snack here when I am in downtown Seattle. They are so good and are reasonably priced!
,,,,,"Came by on memorial day weekend and line was wayyyy too long, came back on tuesday and literally walked right in. Process is super fast, they have little patience to let you browse, get in and out new york style. Don't know what to get? Beef n cheese. It was good but not wait in line for 2hrs good so don't be a tourist and waste your time."

,,,,,"A must stop when in Seattle. We came around 9am on a Saturday morning and the wait was only about 5 minutes. We enjoyed the pastries we got. We didn't order any of their ""popular"" pastries but they were still really good! Staff is super friendly and service is quick. If you walk through the backside there is a little courtyard you can sit in and enjoy your pastries away from the crowds!"
,,,,,"This is like the most popular food place in all of Seattle. Forget about Starbuck, Piroshky Piroshky are what it's all about. If you're at Pike Street Market, literally every other person has a yellow paper bag with piroshkis from this institution."
,,,,,"It's popular for a reason - piroshki are like this super soft, challah like bread stuffed with, well anything you want basically. They have 20+ fillings every day I think and the two I had (smoked salmon and swedish meatballs) were both great. They have Sweet ones too."
,,,,,"Would give 5 stars but that is reserved for their competition, Piroshki on 3rd as they are just a notch better with better quality and more stuffing."
,,,,,"Came here looking for breakfast and settled on the Bacon, Hash Brown, Egg & Cheese Piroshky. The consistency of the bacon and the pairing with the hash browns and egg were married together nicely by the cheese - all of the flavors were present, but I still felt like there was something missing. I found the entire affair to be a bit bland, but this was something that a bit of hot sauce could've have easily alleviated. I was unfortunately not presented with much of a selection on that front, but presentation of the food and location of the shop were both excellent. I urge the store to offer some Secret Aardvark or El Yucateco Habanero hot sauce with this particular piroshky, as either one of those sauces would have put this dish over the top. Definitely was not disappointed, but based on the other reviews I ordered the wrong item or came on a bad day perhaps. Will give this place another shot in the future!"
,,,,,"Look, I only had one thing there.  It was so freaking tasty.  Small little shop, options displayed proudly in a glass case.  Service was prompt.  "
,,,,,"I got the bacon, egg and hashbrown piroshky and was hearty, filling and well seasoned.  The hash browns still kept their integrity and the bread itself was rich and flavorful.  "
,,,,,"It was $8 for one piroshky, it struck me as pricey.  I think $6 would have been more congenial, for the size of it.  Would i buy it again for $8?  Yes, but I often make poor choices in life.  Delicious, poor choices.  "
,,,,,"I'd want to try pretty much anything and everything but particularly the ham, cheese and spinach and the beef/onion piroshky. Lots of folks seem to get the salmon pate, so maybe that, too!"
,,,,,"I got the smoked salmon pate, jalapeño and cheddar cheese roll, and rhubarb piroshkies. All three were bigger than I'd expected and came out to be $19. The two savory ones were delicious, but the ""bread"" was less crispy and looked paler than the ones I've had before, maybe they didn't have an egg-wash and was baked at a lower temp? The sweet one wasn't sickened sweet, which I appreciated!"
,,,,,"Long but fast-moving line and the food was worth the wait. Overall, do recommend despite being a popular tourist destination."
,,,,,Words don't do this place justice. Piroshky Piroshky is phenomenal and a historic favorite at Pike Place Market. The salmon is a crowd favorite and a great small meal or snack while exploring the market. The piroshkys are worth the wait and then some!
,,,,,I don't get the hype for this place. I guess it's a must if you go to Pike Place Market but I wasn't impressed. The best part was the lady shouting at you while you're in line. I'm not being sarcastic. She was hilarious. I enjoyed her energy. Would I do the line again? No
,,,,,3rd time visiting this spot over the years and this was the best time.  A small line out front but went really fast.
,,,,,This time had the traditional beef and onion ($7) and it was fantastic.  Loaded with beef and the bread pastry was nice and flaky and the pirosky was warmed.
,,,,,Came 2nd time at end of day close to 5pm.  Everything was $3.  Not too much left.  I had the beef and cheese and the Cinnamon coffee.  Both were ok.  Will explore other places next time.
,,,,,again another food network mention.  It was good - had the salmon pate & beef cheese piroshkys.  I liked the beef & cheese one better.  Glad I checked it out.  Not necessarily a must go back.  There are alot of good places to pick from at Pike Market.  Note it is located right next door to the original Starbucks.  The original Starbucks was crowded so we didn't get to get coffee there.  No place to sit down at this bakery so it's a take and go kinda thing - walk & eat in the market.    I think the Salmon Pate piroshky was $7.95 and the beef & cheese was about the same.
,,,,,"5 years later, it's still good! They've increased their prices though. It's $7 including tax for salmon."
,,,,,The. Best. Bakery. Ever. 
,,,,,I got their smoked salmon piroshky and it was the best thing I've tasted for $5.40. You must try this place despite the line. I would try every single bread they've got if I lived in Seattle.
,,,,,This place is amazing each time I've had it! They've gotten their ordering system down to a science in order to reduce wait times.
,,,,,Ive previously had the salmon pate and it was delicious.
,,,,,"This time I had the Cinnamon Cardamom Braid and Bacon, Egg, Hashbrown. I really loved the Hashbrown one! Nice savory taste"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,This place had a huge line every time we tried to get food here.
,,,,,"Luckily we only waited for 15 min ,around 6 PM on a Sunday \."
,,,,,Highly recommend getting here before it opens to avoid huge lines.
,,,,,Pastries are def unique here and can understand why line is so long.
,,,,,This place is cash only so make sure to bring cash.
,,,,,We shared to Beef and Cheese Piroshky ($6.36) and Potato and Mushroom Piroshky ($5.45).
,,,,,"The potato and mushroom was a little bready, but potato and mushroom were cooked well. Dough is pillowy, size is pretty big so def share-able between 2 people."
,,,,,"The beef and cheese was surprisingly very light, more beef than cheese heavy."
,,,,,Meat was seasoned well and bread was well baked.
,,,,,"Although line may be long and a little pricy for the portion, worth stopping once for a unique pastry experience in Pike Place."
,,,,,I've seen the food review videos and the great reviews so this place was a must do on our recent trip to Seattle.  Line was short a little before 10am on a Thursday which seems to he unusual as there was a good size line a little later in the day. I tried the bacon egg and hash brown piroshky and it was just ok. Don't know what the hype is about ... dough was bland and the fillings were just ok. It is a nice warm pastry to help warm you up but I don't think we will be coming back.
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky was a must stop anytime we are at Pikes Place. We have been to the store front so many times and Im not sure why I didn't give them a review before...
,,,,,We moved back to Spokane so we had been really missing getting our Piroshky. We have not been back to Seattle for awhile and then here comes Covid-19... 
,,,,,I think the only good thing about Covid-19 lockdown is it brought a Piroshky Piroshky delivery to Spokane. 
,,,,,"I can not tell you how happy we were with our order. Everything was baked fresh and well packaged. The driver was so very nice. We are so thankful that they are coming back to Spokane, we just hope hope that even after Covid-19 and lockdown they continue to come back to Spokane."
,,,,,"I was highly skeptical once I entered the line of about 30 minutes, but it moves pretty fast and was pleasantly surprised. I tried a bunch with my friends and my favorite was the beef and onion. Generally, I preferred the savory options over the sweet ones. Staff are nice and efficient considering how busy they are and right next to the Starbucks so I appreciated that. They're about $7 a piece which is a bit pricey but I'm glad I tried them and I think they're worth trying if you have never had Russian pastries before!"
,,,,,Went to this place last weekend while checking out pike place. There was a line outside by the early afternoon but it moved fast and they had menus so that people could figure out what they wanted to order before they got inside. 
,,,,,"We got the beef and cheese, salmon Pate, and ham cheese and spinach. Everything came out super hot and fresh and ordering was quick. "
,,,,,Beef and cheese: you could tell that this was fresh out the oven from hot hot this one was. They don't skimp on the filling at all and the filling has a wonderful savory taste. The meat gives it all the flavor and it almost tastes like they put something sour (like worsterchire sauce) to balance how heavy the meat filling can be. The bread was wonderfully light too.
,,,,,Salmon Pate: 
,,,,,Definitely loved this one as well too. The bread was light a felt like a cloud when you bit into it. The salmon Pate had a delicate flavor and smooth texture. Would definitely recommend this one as well
,,,,,Ham cheese and spinach:
,,,,,"Also delicious, the flavor is a lot more upfront than the salmon one, and I would definitely recommend to eat this while it's fresh because of the flakiness of the pastry. It was a bit spongy for us but I think that's also because we waited a bit longer to eat it. "
,,,,,Overall I would definitely recommend piroshky piroshky over almost every other place in pike place market. They have great prices for amazing food and not too long of a wait compared to other places. I just wish they were in california too
,,,,,Is the piroshky tasty? Sure. Is it the best I've had? Unfortunately not. Does it get me excited? Not really. 
,,,,,"The bread is more dense, ""bready"" and dry than I'm used to. I'm used to the dough being softer, a bit more chew, and lighter. This dough was almost stiff biscuit like. "
,,,,,The filling...
,,,,,Got the beef and cheese - tasty but salty
,,,,,Smoked salmon - like cream cheese salmon. Alright. 
,,,,,Also got the apple roll (can't remember the exact name). 
,,,,,The best Piroshki I've had was in Inner Richmond district in SF. I can't find anything that comes close...
,,,,,Solid 3/5.
,,,,,"So many tourists around this area next to the first Starbucks store. So when I was waiting on the line for Starbucks store, I got one of the popular ones smoked salmon pate piroshky. "
,,,,,"Honestly, it was little fishy to me and the bread taste like thick soft cracker. "
,,,,,I expected more savory and buttery bread. 
,,,,,I didn't like it. So dry. 
,,,,,I don't know why a lots of people were buying this. 
,,,,,I was wondering only tourist buying this lol.
,,,,,"I think we maybe got the wrong thing for the mood we were in. We popped in here for a little dessert after dinner. We got the hazelnut pastry and the marzipan pastry. They were both good, but very sweet. The marzipan was a little heavy on the filling side - marzipan is thick even as is. If we go back, I think we'd try one of the savory options! I think maybe that's what they're more known for."
,,,,,"Tried the smoked salmon pate, the apple cinnamon roll, and the cinnamon cardamom braid. The first wasn't warmed through as well as I'd hoped, but I liked the flavor. The second was enormous, and I prefer a traditional cinnamon roll. The third was amazing - sticky and sweet! Would return and try other items! Love how the staff was sure to keep the line moving. Overall good experience."
,,,,,"We got the beef and cheese piroshky, and it was super tasty. The portion is perfect to share between friends. It's close to the first starbucks, so grab a piroshky before you go wait in the long line!"
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Great company. They pivoted during pandemic with delivery. They packed everything perfectly. Their piroshkys are delicious! They have both sweet and savory. They make seasonal flavors like turkey and stuffung.  We also ordered delicious frozen clam chowder from them.
,,,,,"The line goes fast and the pastries are FLAKY. We absolutely loved our spinach/cheese and ham/cheese orders. Yeah, $16 is steep for two. But when in Rome, right? If you're at Pike Place, I'd say they're worth a stop."
,,,,,"I was looking for a piroshky place that offered vegan or dairy free options and this one definitely had options. I really appreciate the fact that there 3 vegan options and 1 sweet dairy free (contain a honey so it is not considered vegan). I ordered the veggie chipotle, beef and onion and the garlic cheese. The veggie chipotle was my least favorite as it had a weird taste which I attribute to the chipotle flavoring. The beef and onion was good, but leans on the sweet side due to the onion. Now the garlic cheese I am unsure if I really did get as it didn't seem to have cheese, but if it was the correct one it tasted delicious! My fav out of the 3 vegan I ordered. As for the sweet I ordered the apple cinnamon roll (dairy free not vegan). This was the perfect amount of sweet (not too sweet) as I do not like overly sweet pastries. The line seems long as the wait is outside bc the shop is pretty small, but the line moves quickly. Even if you had to wait it is definitely worth the wait."
,,,,,Definitely a must stop at Pikes Place. The smoked salmon was amazing so was the potato and cheese.
,,,,,"One thing I have ALWAYS been able to count on, since I was a kid, is Piroshky Piroshky, being at Pike Place Market. I know that I'll be able to get an Apple Cinnamon Roll and a Cheddar and Green Onion Roll. Always guaranteed to be good and served up with kindness and a smile! Their lines look hella long, esp during the weekends, but they also move fast!"
,,,,,"Now, they have their food trucks traveling around the northwest and even down to Utah, so make sure to check out their schedule! They're definitely worth a try!"
,,,,,"While waiting in line for the original Starbucks, we got hungry and saw this place. The pastries looked good and made fresh, so we decided to try a variety of them."
,,,,,Chicken curry: tasted like curry but not too much chicken inside; it didn't look like the picture on the menu and more flat... was overall probably the best of the three pastries we got 3.5/5
,,,,,"Smoked salmon: was okay- nothing memorable about it and the texture felt too soft. I couldn't really taste or discern what I was chewing, but the shape was cute 3/5"
,,,,,Chocolate cream hazelnut: the worst one to be quite honest; the chocolate was basically congealed and somehow it didn't taste of chocolate at all. Would not recommend.
,,,,,"Overall I think it's good to try new places especially when it's so popular. Maybe going when they first take out the pastries would be best to taste them fresh, but I don't think I'll go again. The location is convenient though as it's in Pike Place and basically next to the original Starbucks."
,,,,,"Seems like a must try when visiting Pike Place Market. Just wanted something sweet after lunch so I ordered the Cinnamon Cardamom Braid (Cinnamon Cardamom, Raisins and orange peel twisted into a braid, brushed with honey glaze). It was okay, nothing special about it. I think it's also overpriced $6+ w/tax. The staff were nice and friendly though."
,,,,,"This one of the best places to go for bakery items in the PIKE place market. A must visit place in seattle. It's a small shop, with lot of fresh baked goods right from the hot oven. The staff are very friendly and polite. Coming to what to get: 1. The Orange cream (5/5) sweet a bit tangy - a must get. 2. Apricot Turnover (5/5) This one was fresh out from the oven. Great flavor. 3. Chipotle Piroshky (4/5) This had a good amount of Chipotle flavor, not my favorite though. Make sure you eat them hot or warm. Once they cool down they loose the charm. Overall a great local place."
,,,,,"Food here was very subpar and overhyped. Maybe I caught them at a bad day, but it's not worth getting when the price is so expensive. "
,,,,,"The short haired blonde teenager who got our order was very rude. I know working in this industry is stressful but you shouldn't be a bitch to customers who are nice to you. She misheard my order and I told her to replace it, but she gave me attitude and made her other coworker finish our order. I have no idea why she was so disrespectful."
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a Seattle classic, hands down.  For me the star of the show is the potato and cheese piroshky, which is one of their bestsellers.  The cheddar cheese and garlic roll is also truthfully advertised as blissful.  The cinnamon cardamom braid is unique, but you have to like cardamom to go that route.  They sometimes also have limited time offerings - we had a fresh berry sweet piroshky that rocked our worlds.  This is definitely a must-visit stop in the Pike Place market.  There is a line of course, but it's run efficiently (and managed by a woman who's a real character)."

,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,My first time in Seattle and HAD to get some piroshkys.
,,,,,"We ordered the smoked salmon and the hashbrown bacon egg and cheese piroshkys. It was the tail end of the day, so they didn't have all the options available (I was really wanting the cheese garlic). We were lucky since the smoked salmon ones just came out of the oven and they were amazing! The smoked salmon piroshky is even baked in the shape of a fish! "
,,,,,The pastry is sooo buttery and the fillings just hit the spot. I easily killed off my salmon and hashbrown bacon egg and cheese and wanted MORE.
,,,,,"The line here is usually insane! But with only a couple people in mine I finally got to try this place! The smell draws you in, smells like fresh baked bread and it's irresistible. We had just had a large lunch so I really wasn't in the mood for more carbs but again, when the line is short you get in line! Wanted the chocolate hazelnut but seemed to have been out. Grabbed a cinnamon cardamom bread, it was pretty good! Not sweet, just enough cinnamon. Glad I got to finally try this place!"
,,,,,"Not bad, but okay. I've walked by a lot and always been turned off by the long line, even though that usually indicates something good. Finally saw a short line early on a Friday morning and decided to go for it! My friend and I shared the beef and cheese, the bacon hash brown egg and cheese, and the Moscow roll."
,,,,,"The savory ones were disappointing, with really salty filling and a dry crust. I thought these would be served warm, but they were room temp, which I only mentioned because I think it might have been way better warmed up. I'd still be willing to get them to go and try warming it up at home, but as it was, I didn't understand why it's usually so busy."
,,,,,"The Moscow roll was great! Loved it, creamy and not too sweet. I would definitely get it again and would even stand in line! I could see myself coming back for more of the sweet items."
,,,,,Rhubarb - 5/5 very subtle flavor and just the right amount of sweetness
,,,,,Chocolate hazelnut - 4/5 basic. Can't go wrong with these flavors
,,,,,Smoke salmon pate - 2/5 too fishy for my taste
,,,,,"The place is crowded most of the time. Gotta stand in line for over 15 mins and then they hurry you up. I don't like the hurrying up part after standing in the line for such a long time, especially when they don't have some of the items in the menu."
,,,,,What happened???? This is ridiculous to pay $8 for 1 piroshky that doesn't have any filling!!! I can feel only dough. Also after location on 3rd got closed ( they had 20% off after 5 or 6 pm and coupon to collect 9 to get 10th piroshky for free). Price are ridiculous high compare to year ago and also filling it's a joke. I live on 2nd and pine and had to go to pike market to stand line to get this dough with slightly salmon spread. Rip off!!! If tourists buy that rip off I am not going to! As a  European I  am deeply disappointed in this place.
,,,,,My favorite place! I love their beef and onion piroshky. Fresh baked!!! I got a good deal during happy hour only $4.40
,,,,,Amazing. The salmon was great. Chocolate croissant good
,,,,, Potatoes and cheese very good
,,,,,Smell good but taste just ok.  More doughy for my taste.  A bit expensive but expected as it's at Pike Place.
,,,,,I've been coming here  since 1997. Never disappoints. Love the atmosphere in the market area.
,,,,,"Semi-long line when I went but it went by quick. They has a staff members outside making sure people kept moving which helped! Tried a few menu options, all were great but I highly recommend their Chocolate Cream Hazelnut Roll - it was absolutely delicious! Definitely plan to come here again."
,,,,,TDLR: LOVED THE SALMON PATE AND JALAPEÑO CHEDDAR SAUSAGE! LINE LOOKS LONG BUT GOES BY SO FAST BECAUSE OF HOW EFFICIENT THE STORE IS. THE PASTRY IS A LITTLE ON THE PRICY SIDE BUT DEFINITELY WORTH!!
,,,,,"FOOD: We ordered 2 savory piroskys the salmon pate and the jalapeño cheddar sausage. I have to say usually hyped places that all tourist MUST go to are typically overhyped and not worth the wait. Surprisingly this place was DEFINITELY worth it. The jalapeño cheddar sausage was delicious! Not very spicy and not overly cheesy. The star of this pastry was the sausage. It was one of the best sausages I had. It was juicy, flavorful, and had a good bite to it. The only drawback, was the casing to the sausage was a little tough for my girlfriend to bite off. It was perfectly fine for me to eat. Next the salmon pate was so magical. If you are a smoked salmon lover (not lox) then this is your pastry. It was so mouth wateringly flavorful. They put enough filling to bread ratio where it wouldn't be too salty but just right. The salmon pate was soft and packed with umami. The bread was just a little on the harder side. But other than that amazing pastry!! Definitely a must go! Will come back whenever I visit pike place again!! "
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a must when you're at Pikes place! Who doesn't love a warm slightly crunchy carb full pastry filled with deliciousness?! I've had the beef one and the smoked salmon one, both are delicious but the smoked salmon is my absolute favorite because it's rich and savory. I also love that it's fish shaped too! Sometimes the consistency can be different depending on whether you get a fresh batch or one that's been sitting in the display. They definitely taste a lot better when they're fresh out of the oven as opposed to sitting in the display, but that's more of a timing thing. They have sweet pastries too but I haven't tried them myself."
,,,,,"There's a reason why there's usually a line at this place, but generally the line moves pretty quickly so you're never there for too long. If you're at Pike's Place and need a snack to pair with your Starbucks (that you probably had to wait much longer for), definitely check out Piroshky Piroshky to see what the hype is about!"
,,,,,"When they say Piroshky Piroshky is a must visit, they're not wrong! The line can look intimidating and long but they're super efficient and the line moves QUICK. I tried the Smoked Salmon Piroshky and Uli's Jalapeno and Cheddar Sausage Piroshky. For the smoked salmon, the outer pastry is so buttery and soft and the salmon filling is so flavorful. The sausage is great as well! The casing is a bit hard to snap off but love the flavors. "
,,,,,"I even went back to pick up a few more for myself and friends before my flight home. If you have space to hand carry on your trip back home, I recommend it. Just pop it in the microwave when you're ready to eat it."
,,,,,"Yes there's always a line... but always worth it! There's a ""Line Coordinator"" outside who is fun... thrn once inside the ordering goes quick... sweet, savory, vegan & veg options."
,,,,,My mom used to tell me about how good this place is when I was growing up. I finally got the chance to visit Seattle and see what the hype's about! 
,,,,,"This is a staple and the line can get pretty long from what I've seen, but when I went here, I was fortunate enough to wait less than 5 minutes in line. "
,,,,,I love the Moscow roll! It was made deliciously and had a lovely soft hint of sweetness that made snacking while walking through the Pike Place area enjoyable. The sizes here are HUGE! Definitely makes a good deal in terms of quality and price. I'm excited to slide through again when I visit!
,,,,,Nice gem and happy to stumble upon them when so many businesses were closed for the holiday. 
,,,,,Customer service and food were both A+!
,,,,,"The smell of all the fresh bread makes it impossible for you to not *at least* turn your head. Piroshky's is a spot that's always recommended for tourists and locals alike - with good reason. We ordered 3 to sample for our first visit: the Smoked Salmon Pate, Garlic and Cheese (with Tilamook cheese!) and the Chocolate Cream Hazlenut."
,,,,,Personally we loved the savory options over the sweet (though there's plenty more for us to come back and try!)
,,,,,*The line is usually long but it moves pretty fast. 
,,,,,**My favorite touch is that they feature local artists' work on their pastry bags! Such a cool idea.
,,,,,"I dunno...maybe this place was overhyped for me, because I didn't feel like I'd give it 4 stars. It kinda felt pretty average. I had heard that the ones to try are the smoked salmon pate and the beef & cheese. We got two of each of those, as well as the chicken, curry, and rice and the potato and cheese ones. Honestly, I expected more. Our favourite was the smoked salmon pate, but it wasn't as good as I'd thought it'd be--it was a bit dry, and I think the filling to pastry ratio was off. The beef and cheese was okay, but very salty and also dry. Same with the other two. Overall, I felt that they were okay, but largely overhyped. For the wait and the price, it didn't seem super worth it. Glad to have tried it, but might not be going back anytime soon. (Though to be fair, all these amazing reviews are making me question if I just came on an off day for the bakery....)"
,,,,,"The line here is always long but it does go by fast. The place offers both savory and sweet pastries. When the food is fresh from the oven, there is nothing that compares to it. If it has been sitting in the display for a while, they still taste good but nothing spectacular."
,,,,,"Wonderful treats, a bit pricey and crowded, but it's expected around Pike Place.  Have been there a few times the last couple years and it's always a pleasure.  Will be back again soon."
,,,,,"Russian hand pies! That's what these are. The special catch 22 is a veggie scramble - was healthy and flavourful. The crust wasn't crisp but that was taken care of by Piroshky's amazing cheddar and garlic roll. It was so cheesy and crunchy. And you can relish this amazing combo overlooking water at Pike Place market deck! Also, did I say these were quite hearty?!"
,,,,,One star less because the place isn't as well kept.
,,,,,"SERVICE: there is only 1 word to describe this restaurant and it is EFFICIENT. Since this place is very popular, the lines seem extremely long. Although, they seem long actually go by super fast because how quickly everything is done. We waited for about 15 mins. So if you are intimidated by the line, don't worry about it! Also there is a person that controls the flow of the line and shouts out the daily specials, out of stock, most popular pirosky, and more. The pastries are a little expensive but still a must try!"

,,,,,"I've lived in Seattle for about a year and had heard great things about Piroshky Piroshky, but hadn't tried it yet. A friend and I went to Pike Place this weekend while she was visiting and thought we'd try it out. Honestly, I was a little disappointed with my experience. We waited in a long line, but it seemed to move pretty quickly and the staff was very organized and efficient. I ended up ordering the potato and cheese since it was a bestseller, but I found it rather bland compared to what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, just not as flavorful as I had hoped. Perhaps I'd try a different option in the future to give it another chance, but right now I have food options I prefer more at the market."
,,,,,"We apologize that our service was not satisfactory for you. We aim to provide the most excellent customer service and carry our business with high standards. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we will ensure this does not happen again."
,,,,,"I have been here a few times now and I always over order. Now that I think about it, it is good but I come more for the we are in seattle let's do the touristy thing and come here. The more I come here seems just ok. My fave all time is the curry rice piroski just because of the flavor is there. Salmon pate is ok. The chipotle one is too greasy if that is a word. The nutella one was ok. Great to share and sample with your covid free bubble of friends or fam but I'd prob only come here for the curry flavored one if at all."
,,,,,Wondering what smells so amazing walking down Pike Place? It's definitely this place. The smell was what compelled me to stop and wait in the small line out on the sidewalk to try some Piroshky. We waited in line for about 10 minutes and once we got to the counter ordered a beef & cheese Piroshky and a cheddar garlic Piroshky (both listed as best sellers on their website). We took it to go and stopped by Victor Steinbrueck Park a little ways down the street to find a bench to eat on. The Piroshky was warm and simply delicious. I would say the beef & cheese was my favorite of the two that I ordered. This place is definitely a must-try while exploring the Pike's Place Market.
,,,,,"Friendly staff! And the line even tho it was long, it goes by very quick."
,,,,,But - I don't know what the fuss is about. The baked goods looked good but I ordered their top 3 and it was pretty eh. Mostly bread not enough filling and honestly pretty dry
,,,,,I wouldn't recommend buying extra to take home or for later because it doesn't seem like it's good fresh
,,,,,Maybe try one just to check the box that you had a piroshky but honestly I think one visit is enough for me just for the experience
,,,,,"We apologize that our service was not satisfactory for you. We aim to provide the most excellent customer service and carry our business with high standards. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we will ensure this does not happen again."
,,,,,"10/10!!! It was my last day in seattle, I ordered 4 smoked salmon pate for to-go so I can take it all the way back home  to LA! I highly recommend the one by Pike place. The wait can be long but if you time it well, you won't have to wait at all!"
,,,,,The salmon in this bread was a little sweet -- love how it was shaped like a fish. The dough is crispy and complements the pate well.
,,,,,I got the traditional beef and onion and a special chicken philly. The crust is really what takes everything to the next level. The crust on the traditional meat and onion is so flaky and tasty - it does what it's supposed to do. It's really rich and can come off kind of greasy/oily but I think that's the vibe it's meant to have. 
,,,,,"I believe the chicken philly is a rolling item on their menu but it was pretty good, I expected it to be way more cheesy and have more vegetables, that would have made it 10 times better. "
,,,,,"There was a line, but it wasn't too long and it moved quickly. Only one person or group of people who came together are allowed inside at a time. It's an in and out situation because all of the items are already made up. "
,,,,,I think it's worth trying out.
,,,,,COVID 
,,,,,Covid times only one party at the shop and the shop is actually quite small.
,,,,,"Smoke salmon is yummy, especially when it's fresh out of the oven. Each pastry is about $5+, but quite loaded with ingredients, such as the poppy seeds. "
,,,,,They have some special items if the time like April white chocolate with cherry and catch 22 for immune system boost. 
,,,,,"Good service, good food, just be aware of the line."
,,,,,This places offers sweet pastries. The smell and look of the bakery is tantalizing. 
,,,,,I tried some type of pastry with apples tucked in the crevices of the pastry. It was good but I bet had I requested one I'm warmed up or freshly made the taste would have brought a more elevated experience.
,,,,,"Overall, I suggest trying this place out."
,,,,,As if this place needs more positive reviews but heck I love these and they deserve a review!
,,,,,"Always fresh! My favorite is the cheese and potato. They could use a little more of the tillamook cheddar but they are still divine. The salmon one is good too, as are the sweet ones. "
,,,,,They've raised the prices on these quite a bit over the years. That is a drawback.

,,,,,We were getting ready to leave Pike's Place Market and looking forward to a long drive through Seattle traffic. So we walked over to this spot to grab a snack for the drive. 
,,,,,The line started outside and was a little long but very fast moving. Turns out they only have space for maybe 2-3 people inside due to Covid social distancing so the line actually wasn't very long at all. 
,,,,,"We ordered the Apple Cinnamon Roll, Uli's Jalapeño Cheddar Sausage, and Cinnamon Cardamom Bread. Sweet, savory and just what we needed to get through the drive home! "
,,,,,"The bread was soft and sweet, the sausage was not spicy but still sooooo good! The apple was fresh and crisp, the cinnamon was sweet but not overly sweet. They definitely got their recipe down and I wish I could give them more stars!"
,,,,,"Made a quick stop here on my way over to the Seattle Aquarium and got the beef and onion piroshky. The pastry was light, flakey, and packed with so much flavor! I wish I could have tried everything on the menu, but I'll just have to make a return visit soon."
,,,,,"Ok, ok...not what I would have chosen for breakfast, but when a friend says this is the place to try, I couldn't resist.  The reviews are on point with this one.  Hands down delicious pastries with all kinds of fillings.  We shared several different ones from sweet to savory.  Each was fluffy and perfectly soft from edge to edge.  Consistency is key and they all fit the bill."
,,,,,Glad to have tried this on a quick weekend visit.  The line was worth it!
,,,,,"Nice staff and good food. Organize the line nicely and the menu is posted on the line holders as you wait. They recommend getting 1 sweet, 1 savory, but I honestly feel like you won't miss out if you skip on the sweet. "
,,,,,I got the smoked salmon pate and the salmon cardamon braid.
,,,,,Would highly recommend the salmon pate! Was delicious on a rainy day. 
,,,,,"Cardamon braid was sweet and good, but a bit dry for me and not something I'd get again"
,,,,,"You cannot go wrong with anything you get here! I came back almost everyday during my trip to try all the delicious baked goods! The salmon pâté and the jalapeño sausage was my favorite! I wish we had one in California, but I guess this is one reason to come back again!"
,,,,,A small place that packs a punch!
,,,,,I came on a Wednesday with my family around 9 a.m. and miraculously there was only one person in front of us. The service was great and we were in and out quickly. 
,,,,,"I ordered Uli's jalapeño cheddar sausage and I admit I was expecting chunks of sausage not a whole sausage. However, it was incredible. There was lots of flavor, it was juicy and had a good amount of spice. My sister enjoyed her apple cinnamon roll and everyone else scrounged theirs down as well. "
,,,,,"What a great spot. Mornings don't seem to be as busy, but I'm sure if you come for lunch the lines will be long."
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky has become a classic Pike Place institution, with both traditional and non-traditional takes on Russian pastries! In my opinion, the thing to come for is the Smoked Salmon Pate Piroshky, which was in the shape of a fish and contained a filling of smoked salmon mixed with cream cheese and chives. But my favorite part about the pastry was the crispy texture of the outside crust, which contrasted perfectly with the soft, warm, bready interior and the savory, unctuous filling. I also loved the photogenic shape of the pastry, which was a long, narrow torpedo-like fish."
,,,,,"Hi David, we're delighted to hear that you're a fan of our Piroshky! Thanks so much for spreading the word and for writing a review. Our business depends on regulars like you! We hope to see you again soon, David!"
,,,,,"I wasn't as impressed with the piroshky I had this time around. We beat the line but someone still ended up cutting us :( We weren't sure if he was a part of the group ahead of us, so let it slide. But still...rude. "
,,,,,"I got the potato cheese and my boyfriend got the smoked salmon. They're quite big and about $7/piece. I would prefer smaller services at a cheaper price point so I could try more... but I'm kinda over it and will likely skip this place in the future. My boyfriend's pasty was piping hot. I could literally see the steam coming out. However, mine was cold and flavorless. I was a bit disappointed and ate about half before pocketing the rest for home."
,,,,,"So nice, they named it twice! Honestly, you can't go wrong with what you order here. We got a variety of items such as the pesto tomato roll, eggs and ham roll, salmon pate, and the beef & cheese roll. All were delicious, but that beef & cheese roll? Drool-worthy!!!"
,,,,,I seriously could plan my day around a trip here. Definitely put this place down as mandatory to visit at the market.
,,,,,"There was a crazy line when we went on a Monday, but it went fast, was organized, and the wonderful smell was great to distract you."
,,,,,"We got the almond pastry, cinnamon braid item, and my friend got some savory items. It was so soft and fresh and it definitely made its aroma in the car. You definitely want these fresh. "
,,,,,I would definitely say to stop by with a cup of coffee and tea and enjoy by the waterfront.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Located at the Pike Place Market stood a long line outside Piroshky Piroshky as crowds passed by wondering what we were standing outside for. This was my first time trying Piroshky because I didn't realize that there were vegan options. I really appreciate how inclusive this bakery was, but the vegan chipotle was very dry and not worth $7 in my opinion. "
,,,,,"However, my friends ordered meat and vegetarian friendly options that they really enjoyed. The employees were nice despite the rushed environment."
,,,,,Salmon pate wassup. I wish they sold the pate in a can so I can take it home! We're coming back for more!!
,,,,,"I came to Pike Place for other purposes, However, I came to a popular Piroshki store because I wanted to eat Piroshki for lunch. There is a menu board and a roped line on the street of the store. So wait for your turn to enter the store.The menu board is a good reference. I chose the best-seller beef & cheese and smoked salmon pate piroshki. I bought that piroshki and went to a scenic patio at Pike Place, where some people were eating lunch as well. The beef and cheese piroshki had a light taste and smoked salmon pate was good. Piroshki was a little lacking in taste or needed something but If you're hungry when you come to Pike Place, it might be a good idea to gaze at the pier while eating piroshki in one hand. "
,,,,,Next time I will try another piroshki.
,,,,,"Great assortments of pastries both savory and sweet, but overall not my top option for breakfast I'm Seattle.... You'll see lines but it's more because you have to try it out than because it's tasty."
,,,,,"Yum! We came early so we didn't have to wait long, but judging by the set up it can get pretty crazy! I got the garlic cheese roll and my husband got the salmon pastry. Both were amazing!"
,,,,,"I love this place!!! Everything I tried here is good, but I come here specifically for the salmon piroshki!!!"
,,,,,"Glad you enjoyed our Salmon Piroshky, John! Come back and see us again soon."
,,,,,"When I asked about the rhubarb, I was shocked that a sweet-looking pastry is filled with vegetables...but I completely understood the hype once I gave it a try. The filling is soft and slightly stringy to match the consistency and taste of strawberries. The bread was also chewy and warm. "
,,,,,"Really appreciate the clerk who explained what this pastry was, and would definitely recommend for visitors and locals!"
,,,,,"Every time I come to Seattle, this place is on my food's list. The first time I tried Piroshky, it as during a Seattle food tour. We got to sample a ton of bites from all over Pike Market Place. This place has always been on my list ever since. The service is quick and nice. Whenever I come here, there is a line out the door. The place is small but there's a lot going on inside. The price can be a little steep for some of the smaller pastries but it's worth a try if you're new to Seattle."
,,,,,"The baked goods are fresh and always warm. My favorite is the Beef and Cheese!! It's soft and chewy, the beef is grounded and mixed with cheese. It do not look super appealing, if I'm being honest, but every bite made me wish I had ordered more! Another close favorite is the Salmon piroshky!! This one is a knockout. The flavor is rich and savory and packs a punch. The salmon is like a purée which makes it a little weird. I wish there were chunks of salmon to add more texture but the taste is amazing. The Jalapeño Cheese sausage is really good too, but needs a little mustard to dip with. We also ordered some dessert pastries. The cinnamon cardamon was really nice. It was simple but had so much flavor, also not over powering with sugar. The Rhubarb pastry was very dense and not particularly my favorite. The chunks of fruit in the middle was nice but the party as a whole lacked flavor. I wish there was another dimension to it, a pinch of cinnamon, or strawberry drizzle on top would have made is perfect!"
,,,,,"I definitely would recommend this place. We always come for a quick bite to snack on before we start shopping around, and we always buy some extras for later! I've never had Russian food, so I don't know what to compare it to, but it's a nice treat to try when you're at Pike!"
,,,,,This is a MUST GO TO at pike market place!!! It's usually about a 10-15 minute wait but worth every Penny!! I highly recommend the garlic cheese bread you will not regret! I'm still dreaming about it.
,,,,,"This review is for their food truck event in San Francisco. Since covid hit, this Seattle favorite has expanded to pop-up/food truck events and delivery service to sustain business. Follow them on social media to check their schedule. Once you find them, you have to preorder with a minimum of $50. The pastries come frozen in an ice box and they fly them to the food truck event - in this case, Spark Social in Mission Bay SF. Don't be surprised if you see a line, a lot of people come for these goodies and with good reason. "
,,,,,"Their version of Piroshky is not like any other. They do not skimp on ingredients, evidently seen from its filling that is full from end to end. The bread is thin just enough to envelope the delicious filling. I love how the bread is not oily and soggy, how the filling retains its texture even after being frozen and reheated in an oven. It took me back to when I was actually in Seattle, enjoying the sights and food scene, walking with a piroshky in one hand."
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Looking for some Russian pastries? This is definitely the place for you! There is of course a long line at any time of day BUT it moves so quickly! The staff is super nice and efficient. 
,,,,,I definitely recommend grabbing the Korean Beef and Rice (Seasonal - October) and Smoked Salmon Pate! Try to it while it is still hot/warm!
,,,,,A must stop if you're in Seattle!! I liked the savory pastries over sweet. Line may be a little long sometimes but moves fast! There are menus available while you're waiting in line - make sure you know what you want by the time you're at the counter to order!
,,,,,"Walking around, we stumbled upon this bakery. "
,,,,,We could've easily missed the bakery had we not noticed the long lines in front. We tried our luck to return and luckily- it seemed meant to be!
,,,,,We picked out what was left of our choices which were still plentiful. Took a bite and we realized what the hype was about! 
,,,,,"Next morning, we had half of our goodies left and they were just as amazing as that first bite, fresh from the bakery!"
,,,,,"As though this place needs more hype--here's another review. Depending on season and time of day, you can expect a decent wait (10-15 minutes to get an order in), but the line moves fairly quickly. I have liked everything I've had, from the traditional to the not-so-traditional (jalapeño cheddar sausage!). It has all been delicious and worth the wait."
,,,,,"If you are coming to Seattle for the first time or have been living here for years. It's a must go to place. They serve both savory and sweet flavors. I personally loved the hazelnut and jalapeño cheddar. Everything is fresh baked. You can eat these puffs at any time of the day - breakfast, lunch or evening snack. But I would say go in the morning, they always have long queues. But it's worth the wait. And yeah, it's mostly grab and go for the orders."
,,,,,We had Moscow roll and chocolate cream hazelnut. If I were to rank my favorite would be Moscow roll but actually both are delicious!! 
,,,,,"I'm a big fan of pastries and have been tried many Seattle's famous bakeries, and this place has become one of my favorites!"
,,,,,Glad you enjoyed our Moscow Rolls! Please come see us again soon!
,,,,,"Just buy two trust me. We randomly found this spot and smoked the bakery. We decided to randomly try it, and I must say it's simply amazing. I recommend trying two different types of items. You will be happy you did that. I bought the chicken curry and bacon potatoes cheese bread. Both were simply amazing."
,,,,,Go early to avoid the lines! They open at 8 on the day we went but we arrived around 915 and had to wait about 10 minutes to order. 
,,,,,"It's a super small storefront and during Covid and they only allow one party into the store to order. We got several items including the smoked salmon pate, apple cinnamon roll, and a mushroom+potato piroshky."
,,,,,The best item by far is the smoked salmon which is a 5/5. If you love bagels and lox then this is a must try. Creamy smoked salmon goodness in great bread yummmm. The mushroom+potato was okay and wasn't my favorite. The potato was cut up similar to a hashbrown style but not fried. The apple cinnamon was a very large portion with a ton of bread and baked apples in the center. Not overly sweet and a good sweet alternative.
,,,,,The only food I had twice while in Seattle for a vacation. Their piroshky's are delicious and the turnover of food is high because it's so popular so you know the food will be fresh and hot! I loved snacking my way through Public Market and this was a must try for anyone whether you're local or not!
,,,,,RUN don't walk!! Make your way over to piroshky piroshky and grab yourself a salmon pate and beef & cheese bun. You will thank me later. My fiancé and I basically lived off of these during our stay in Seattle lol I miss it already.
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"The pastries here were definitely worth the hype!! The chocolate croissant was off the chain and the coffee cinnamon roll was too good! The location is really small and the line is long, but it does move quick. The folks working are really helpful and it goes really quick if you know exactly what you want to order. It's really warm inside since location is small and a lot of baking, but you'll manage. "
,,,,,Check them out for yourself and take notice of the cool wall next to the register with all the types of currencies! Shoutout to the Pakistani Rupee on the wall of Mr. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (founder of Pakistan in 1947).
,,,,,So fabulous!
,,,,,"I was a little nervous when I saw the line outside, but it's only because this is really just a counter where you order and pick up immediately. So the line moves very fast. "
,,,,,"I had the beef and cheese, which is kind of like an empanada but way better. It is packed with filling and very flavorful. I also had the cream and cherries, which I highly recommend. It's like an awesome cherry turnover. "
,,,,,Service was fast and friendly. Highly highly recommend!
,,,,,"Wow-- Piroshky Piroshky came up as a ""must visit"" spot when looking at the shops and restaurants in Pike Place.  There was so much hype, that I was concerned it would be a let down-- but I'm pleased to report that it lived up to the hype 100%."
,,,,,"There was a line when we visited-- about 15 minutes or so in the early morning. However, the line moved very quickly and they were efficient once we got inside to order.  They include menus with pictures of available items as you're walking in so you're ready to go when you get inside.  My partner and I each got 2-- which was way too much for us  (these are huge!) but we just couldn't decide.  I got the beef and onion and the garlic roll.  Both were phenomenal and worth the wait."
,,,,,We ended up stopping here first and enjoying our goodies while we waited in line at the Starbucks line-- which worked out perfectly.
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky is the heartbeat of Pike Place and if not Seattle. It is nestled in the parallel street from the market and will be notable for the long line outside. 
,,,,,"In a light rainy cloudy weather, a nice warm salmon Piroshky just hits the spot. They are fresh out of the oven and is baked to perfection. From minced beef to cheese to potato's there is a plethora of baked goods available. "
,,,,,It is a Togo food corner so expect to take your food to the Seattle Pike Place to eat your bite. 
,,,,,The only caveat or concern for our experience was the workflow that from Piroshky. We ordered online and we're unable to find a line to gather our pre-ordered food. It would be rather welcoming to have an additional line or better direction to secure our bag. 
,,,,,"Other than that, this was a great grab and go goodie, just be prepared for the line."
,,,,,"This is the 2nd time Ive been to Piroshky Piroshky and for some reason it didn't hit quite the same as it did the first time! It was amazing the first time we had it. If you've never been, it's worth a try."
,,,,,We got 4 piroshkys:
,,,,,- salmon pate 4/5
,,,,,- potato and mushroom 3/5
,,,,,- cheddar cheese + jalapeno 5/5
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,- (seasonal) meatball with mushroom 3/5
,,,,,For a total of ~$35
,,,,,"While it is good, always fresh, and the ridiculously long line moves quickly, there's a lot of good food in Seattle that I would rather have."
,,,,,The line moved quickly and these warm Russian pastries were the perfect thing to enjoy in the cold rainy Seattle weather.
,,,,,"Beef & onion was definitely my personal favorite- with a flaky croissant-like crust and perfectly seasoned filling. I also got the smoked salmon pastry, which had more of a bread-like crust. I also got the cinnamon cardamom braid which was a bit citrusy as well. Overall, a fun and yummy snack spot at Pike Place Market!"
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky. Yes please. Yes please. 
,,,,,I was told the lines were long but we went between lunch and dinner which is apparently the sweet spot. 
,,,,,"Did a half eaten piroshky make its way into my carry-on luggage? Yes, yes it did."
,,,,,I heard many good things about Piroshky Piroshky via YouTube videos. It lived up to the hype. I got the beef and cheese and the apple cinnamon roll. The beef and cheese was delicious. The beef had a good amount of flavor and the cheese made it even better. The pastry itself was very good as well. 
,,,,,The apple cinnamon roll was a nice treat. It wasn't too sweet and it had big chunks of apple in it. Both were worth the short wait time and the money. It was $14 for both of them. Be a little patient and you WILL be rewarded
,,,,,"Surprisingly there wasn't a line on Halloween day. Overall, this place is just ok and a bit overrated. Recommended to try it once if you're visiting though. My top recommendations include Salmon Piroshky and Potato and Mushroom Piroshky. We tried others, but once again no wow factor. The line can get long and also be patient!"
,,,,,"If you're headed to Pike's Place, odds are you are probably going to stop here. This is definitely a must for people visiting the Seattle area. Since this is a tourist spot, lines tend to get long. However they know how to work efficiently there! They have menus posted throughout the line and they have a worker telling customers to have their orders ready. Luckily at the time I went the line wasn't so long!"
,,,,,"We tried 3 different ones: the Moscow roll, the potato and cheese & the chicken curry and rice. Wow they were all good. The Moscow roll had just enough sweetness. The chicken curry and rice was so flavorful yet the pastry part was still very flakey. The potato & cheese, I could eat it everyday. It was all really good & I would definitely get it again. "
,,,,,I do know they ship but I'm sure it's a pretty penny.
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Everyone was raving about how Piroshky Piroshky is a MUST to try in Seattle, and I was SO excited. I LOVE piroshkies, and after my Mom and I got off our flight and checked into our hotel, our first thing to check off our list as tourists is to get lunch! We zipped our way to Pike Place and jumped into line. Thankfully, the line went pretty quick even though it was long. Their ordering system is super  efficient. You just go to the counter, tell them what you want to order, and they put everything in paper bags for you, and then you pay."
,,,,,"My mom and I ordered 4 piroshkies, 2 savory and 2 sweet:"
,,,,,Salmon pate
,,,,,Beef and cheese
,,,,,Cinnamon cardamom bread
,,,,,Poppy seed cinnamon roll
,,,,,"The girl who took our order was SO nice, and asked me if my beanie was of Aku from Samurai Jack. She was so sweet about it, and she guessed correctly, so she wins total brownie points!"
,,,,,"We took our piroshkies outside and ate under a shady tree. Customer service, efficiency, and presentation were all great! However, I only wish the piroshkies lived up to the hype. They're not bad! They're just not...mind-blowing. "
,,,,,"The salmon pate was honestly the most disappointing one. Very skimpy salmon filling. It was the first thing my mom bit into, and she said it was so overrated and not worth it, and expensive. "
,,,,,"Beef and cheese was quite good. My mom liked this one, and I enjoyed it as well, it was a hearty one. "
,,,,,My personal favorite was the cinnamon cardamom bread. It was sweet and I love cardamom and cinnamon. My mom didn't care much about this. 
,,,,,We also enjoyed the poppy seed one.
,,,,,"For all of these, while my mom enjoyed the beef and cheese and the poppy seed piroshky, she only took a few bites of each piroshky and had me eat most of them. Which I don't mind, but we felt like back in the San Francisco Bay Area, we can get other breads and pastries that taste better for better prices and no line to wait in. "
,,,,,At least I'm happy to say we at least checked this off our list on our first trip to Seattle! And on the first day too!
,,,,,"I admit we decided to stop by Piroshki Piroshki because of recommendations from TikTok videos. We ordered the smoked salmon pate and cinnamon cardamom braid. The pastry on the smoked salmon pate was very good- definitely fresh. It would have been great to have a sauce to dip this in! The cinnamon cardamom braid was so soft and fluffy but for some reason I didn't love the flavor profile (possibly the combination with the orange glaze?). If you're expecting something that tastes like a cinnamon roll, I wouldn't recommend this. They're a little pricey but it is Seattle after all! The line moves rather quickly so I wouldn't worry about that. I'd give this place a solid 3.5 stars. If we get the chance to come back I'd love to try some other pastries."
,,,,,"I arrived at Piroshky Piroshky early in the morning, so the line wasn't outrageously long. I ordered both the smoked salmon pate and the beef and cheese. IMO, the salmon was way better than the beef. My favorite bite was actually the salmon's tail lol. So crunchy!"
,,,,,"Overall, I'd say that this place is good but nothing to write home about. Had they been stuffed with more filling, the pastries probably would have been more flavorful. Definitely make sure you devour these treats immediately upon receiving them, since you want them as hot as possible."
,,,,,So nice they named it twice. This particular location is sandwiched in between Beechers and the original Starbucks location in Pike Place.
,,,,,"We were here during the covid restrictions so there was a bit of a line. However, they managed it pretty good so the wait wasn't too bad."
,,,,,"I ordered the beef and cheese piroshky and really enjoyed it. It was served fresh and warm and the flavor profile was amazing. There are many, many options to choose from (even vegan)."
,,,,,Splitting one of these with your S/O or child would be easy which makes it a super affordable (and delicious) snack to enjoy while exploring the market.
,,,,,Highly recommended.
,,,,,Never disappoints!
,,,,,"Their food is great to eat while exploring Pike Place and the Waterfront! The line may look long but it goes by relatively quickly, as the workers are super efficient inside of the store. "
,,,,,"I love how big and fresh all of their pastries are! We got the Beef & Cheese, Potato & Cheese, Cheddar Cheese & Garlic Roll, and Apple Cinnamon Roll. All were really amazing! My favorite was the Beef & Cheese! They also have seasonal pastries sometimes, like for this month they had BBQ Pork Piroshky."
,,,,,Been to Seattle many times and can't believe this is my first time trying a Prioshky...and it was actually pretty good.  I ordered the smoked salmon pate and the filling was hot and delicious!  Will definitely come back to try their other flavors the next time I am in town!  I can't believe I've been missing out on this yumminess all these years!
,,,,,I have been coming here for 15+ years on every trip to Seattle and it never ceases to amaze me. 
,,,,,Every. Single. Item. Is. Wonderful! 
,,,,,"I will continue to come here anytime I am in town, and I hope that everyone seeing one of these 6,000+ reviews realizes that it's worth the wait. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
,,,,,"Coming as a tourist to Seattle, I understand why this place constantly has a long line. Their piroshkies are truly so great. My favorites were the veggie, potato mushroom, garlic/cheese, and the moscow roll! They do sell out of the chocolate hazelnut cream roll pretty quickly, so try and score that one, but you can't go wrong. "
,,,,,"Try and come on a random weekday, and maybe you'll find the line to be shorter! I had to wait about 5 minutes on a random wednesday before closing. The other piroshky piroshky you see on your way (on pike) might not be open, but the one at the market definitely is!"
,,,,,AMAZING PASTRIES AND AMAZING WORKERS!!! This was my first time trying these type of pastries and ughh the sausage was def JUICYYYYY you can tell they make their sausage in house and the cheese and beef one muuahh I killed that in seconds!! If I could get this everyday I would. 
,,,,,We traveled to seattle for three days and the first two days the lines were supppper long so we're like ehhh we'll just wait another day when the line is shorter. Went on our last day.... AND BLESS the line was cut half way so we hopped in and once we got in line it started building up. 
,,,,,"Pastries were fluffy, packed w meat and ugh still has me thinking about it. Even though it was super busy the workers were still super nice and welcoming!"
,,,,,"Piroshky is always going to be a must stop whenever I'm in Seattle. Not too long of a line on a Monday, I will recommend that you come prepared with your order. They put picture menus outside along the lines so you can peruse, and it's cause they gotta move people in and out so you're not waiting forever."
,,,,,"The vibes are no-nonsense, but they are really nice. If you understand that they deal with demanding tourists and unkind faces on the daily, and you offer a more friendly smile and positive energy, they'll return it right back. The ladies in front of me were less prepared with their order, adding things last minute (which if you're on vacation, I guess do what you want while you're there but still), and not making great eye contact with the worker, and the lady was definitely more straight-forward and blunt with them. "
,,,,,"I ordered the go-to salmon pate, saw that the potato and cheese was empty on the shelf and asked if they had any ready in the back. She stated that they were fresh and hot out of the oven, I was super excited, ""that's perfect!"" and she checked out my items and just threw in a smile saying ""I hope you get everything else you ask for."" It was unexpectedly kind!"
,,,,,"Both were delicious by the way, pretty carb heavy but nothing wrong with that."
,,,,,"We passed by this place and it smelled sooooo good. I already wanted to try this place, but the smell just confirmed a visit."
,,,,,"The smoked salmon pate was a wonderful, fluffy pastry with maybe not enough salmon filling, but I liked that it wasn't heavy or too much food (so I could try more things!)."
,,,,,"I also got the beef and cheese roll and the poppy seed roll. The poppy seed roll was interesting because it looks like a sweet treat, but it's got a nutty, muted flavor that makes it a unique bread. Really liked it!"
,,,,,"Only complaint is that it's pricier than your average bakery, but it's probably worth for the one of a kind pastries that you can't really find elsewhere. "
,,,,,One of my favorite visits in Seattle! Wish I could've tried everything.

,,,,,"Small little Russian bakery located in Pike Place Market. They are one of the first places to open on the weekdays so your nose should lead you there. Never had Russian treats before so we were excited and got 4 for the road. It served us well because we ate it for breakfast for the next few days. I'm used to Asian bakery where the bread is light and soft. The ones we got at Piroshky Piroshky were super dense. We got the beef and cheese, potato and cheese and the jalapeno and cheddar sausage. We weren't huge fans of the beef and cheese because of how dense the bread was. But definitely fans of the other two. If we had room in our tummies, we would have tried a savory treat too. "
,,,,,The person ringing us up was super nice and welcoming considering how there was no AC in the bakery and the line was endless. Kudos to the team for allowing Seattle visitors to try Russian goodies!
,,,,,"A necessary visit at Pikes Market that makes a great breakfast (the piroskies are HUGE and not just a little snack, wish they were smaller so we could try more!)"
,,,,,Of the piroskies we tried I think I prefer the savory ones
,,,,,---sausage: the sausage was very flavorful and juicy
,,,,,---potato pirosky: also great flavors and a good vegetarian option
,,,,,---beef and onion: this one is flaky instead of soft baked bread
,,,,,---cardamom braid: ehhh just okay
,,,,,The line is long earlier in the day but seems to get shorter towards the later afternoon
,,,,,They are a super OG Russian bakery located right next to Pike Place. There's always a long line there but it moves fast!
,,,,,"- Smoked Salmon Pate: My goto and it's soooo good! The pate is soft and flavorful, the richness goes so well with the bread."
,,,,,"- Bacon, Egg, and Hashbrown: delicious breakfast in one bite!"
,,,,,Other favorites are Beef & Onion and Potato & Mushrooms
,,,,,Never had a piroshky before but suddenly became addicted after coming here! So much variety and all is so good!
,,,,,"If you only get one thing, get the Smoked Salmon Pate!"
,,,,,"Don't let the long line outside scare you away from waiting in line. The pastries are really good and worth the wait. If you are there with a group of people, I suggest splitting up and each person ordering food or drinks from different places in Pikes Place Market Place to help with the waiting times and enjoying all of the different foods together."
,,,,,"I've tried a lot of different pastries from here (pre-covid times) and they were all good. I liked the savory ones a lot more than the sweet ones; but just my personal preference. This time around, I only got the smoked salmon pate and beef and onion savory flavors. The pastries are a lot bigger in person than the pictures make it look."
,,,,,"I came on a super busy day, and a very busy time and waited about 30 minutes to get to the front. The employees were very efficient and moving quickly so it moves a lot faster than it looks."
,,,,,"Make sure to have cash on hand. When I went, the credit card readers were down and it was cash only. The credit card readers came back online a little later but have cash on you just in case!"
,,,,,"I was a little disappointed by this place. Multiple people told me it was amazing, but I am definitely not convinced. I tried the potato and cheese, garlic and cheese, beef and cheese, and the chocolate one. The beef was the best out of all but I still wouldn't get it again."
,,,,,"My friend and I were trying to count the number of times we've been to Seattle, together and separate and it's quite a few. We often spend a lot of time in the Pike's Place Market area because well I love to eat and try things from all of the little places."
,,,,,We had never had anything from Piroshky Piroshky and I'd be lying if I said I'd ever really noticed them in previous visits. 
,,,,,"That all changed this past weekend, this spot was Poppin' off Piroshky Piroshky - every time we were nearby the line was super long. People were flocking to this place like mad and being that we'd never tried them before I became slightly interested in the fascination that I hadn't witnessed in the past."
,,,,,We happened upon a shorter line later in the day on Sunday and although I wondered if Delta would charge me an additional fee to board my return flight home after all I'd eaten this weekend I still had zero hesitation to hop in line. 
,,,,,"The smells coming from this bakery are quite delightful! We glanced over the menu in line, and the smoked salmon pate item was sold out for the day but we tried three other items that were all delish."
,,,,,"I really enjoyed the savory items, the beef & cheese and potato & cheese are SOOOO good! The actual dough is very yummy, the filling is so tasty."
,,,,,"The cinnamon sweet item we tried was good too, but the savory are the clear winners in my opinion."
,,,,,Served warm and enjoyed quickly thereafter is the move.
,,,,,"I don't think I'll ever return to the area without stopping off in here. It's delish! I noticed a few reviews mentioning dry, there was nothing dry about our order. Everything was fresh and very delectable."
,,,,,I'm about ready to book a flight to get back up there for a taste of that smoked salmon pate.
,,,,,"This place is GREAT! It is worth the waiting (not too long of a wait though). As a person who's from California and not well versed with Piroshkis, this place is great and has amazing selections for meat eaters and vegetarians, so anyone can find something to pick. "
,,,,,My BF and I came around 11am and had to wait for 10-15mins in a line because it is popular but worth it after we got our order. 
,,,,,"WHAT WE ORDERED: 2 Bacon Hash-brown egg and cheese, 1 potato and cheese, and 1 cheddar garlic roll. "
,,,,,These were amazing - if anything wish they were warmer but other than that still 5/5 
,,,,,Would recommended for sure!!!
,,,,,"Piroshky Piroshky is a must stop in pikes place. The food is truly delicious!!  If you go on a weekend when it's crazy busy, this crew has the process down pat!  Listen to the team directing traffic and you'll get your treat in no time!!"
,,,,,"My wife and I went every single day we were in Seattle and I got something different each time. Each item was better than the last. You really can't go wrong here, just know what you want when you get to the counter!"
,,,,,Seattle is one of our favorite cities to visit and Piroshky Piroshky is now a tradition and requirement anytime we go. 
,,,,,Check them out!
,,,,,Finally got to try this place when we happened to spot a short line!
,,,,,"My mom and I purchased a couple of pastries to take home with us the next morning as we had an early flight out of Seattle. While I chose a Cinnamon Coffee Piroshky for myself, it would've been 10x better had I eaten it fresh out of line. My piroshky was still tasty and had the perfect amount of cinnamon-y goodness, but I should've followed the lady's advice that it's best consumed up to 2-4 hours after purchase."
,,,,,Would absolutely return to try it fresh next time!
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This is an impossible-to-miss spot in Pike Place with a line snaking down the sidewalk essentially throughout its open hours. Don't let the line scare you off, though - service is extremely quick and the waits are never terribly long. "
,,,,,"Because they want to keep things moving quickly, the servers aren't necessarily the friendliest and the person greeting you outside is incredibly loud and obnoxious and seems to constantly be screaming for little to no reason either about how the line should continue moving (which would be managing just fine with or without her yelling) or random nonsense about Pike Place no one asked for. "
,,,,,"After making it past all the yelling and into the storefront you're greeted by the scent of wonderful pastries. Striving for quick service means they are all made in advance and it's really a mixed bag on whether you receive something fresh or something that's been sitting for a while. If you're lucky enough to get fresh pastries, they're amazing. I've had about half the menu without many complaints - that is unless I've received something that's been out a while. In that case, the pastry is usually fairly hard and the filling cold and lackluster. An old chocolate cream hazelnut roll just tastes like yesterday's leftover croissant with chilled Nutella. "
,,,,,"If the service were a little more welcoming and you were guaranteed fresh pastry, this place would easily be five stars."
,,,,,Hey Eric! Thank you for your words. We try our best to keep the quality consistent. We will do our best to keep the line moving peacefully. Thank you for stopping by we hope to see you again soon!
,,,,,I'm going to have to be the odd man out and say it...
,,,,,They were not the best ‍
,,,,,The line moved pretty quick and this was a must stop after reading the other reviews on our most recent Seattle visit. We ordered the beef bulgogi and the mushroom and onion. Both had a lack of filling/not very much filling and the breading had zero flavor. It was like eating a piece of white bread with a tablespoon of filling on it. We have had several piroshkis in our travels and these by far would be at the bottom of my list for flavor. 
,,,,,"They have a wide variety so it is fun to mix and match and try different flavors, but as far as flavor in my opinion it was pretty bland. They do seem to be a Seattle staple because many talk about them so if you are new to the area or looking for a favorite foodie spot this may be for you just not for me :)"
,,,,,"My friend and I had a layover in Seattle. We decided to walk Pikes Place, where I ran into this shop. Well, realistically I could smell the amazing aroma hundreds of feet away. I decided to wait in line so I could get a few of these."
,,,,,"I ended up with beef and Cheddar, salmon pate, potatoes with cheese and a dessert one with hazelnut."
,,,,,"I honestly wanted to eat it right then and there, but decided to hold off."
,,,,,"Landed back in Phoenix and ate them with my family. My Gosh! If they were that amazing after a few hours of being in my luggage, I can only imagine them fresh! I literally want to fly back out to Seattle just to buy some more lol"
,,,,,**Late Review** 
,,,,,"It was my wife and I's first time in Seattle, so it was a must to try out all of Seattle staples and most favorited foodies/activities! I highly recommend this place and is a must-visit! "
,,,,,"Long story short, While my wife waited in the long line at Starbucks, I left and went ahead and ordered a few items at Piroshkys. "
,,,,,"Thanks to the delicious Piroshkys, I kid you not, that was the best wait-in-line experience ever. Our food hit the spot perfectly and after taking a bite of all the items we ordered, we finished about 75% of it while waiting in line just because  it was still fresh and just had so much flavors/aromas embedded into the Piroshky. "
,,,,,It even looked so good visually that people waiting in line around us saw our food and had their family members go and order some food for them at Piroshkys! 
,,,,,Items we ordered: 
,,,,,-Beef & Onion 
,,,,,- Potato & Onion 
,,,,,- Rhubbarb Piroshky 
,,,,,"Also, kudos to all the folks working! They were very kind and welcoming even though it was a very hot day and even hotter inside. "
,,,,,Recommend: 10/10 *****
,,,,,"Wam, fresh and delicious Russian pastries where you can pick savory or sweet.  It's been 10 years since we got a taste of Piroshky Piroshky and it was exactly how we remember and better! We've been saying we wanted to come back to Seattle just because of Piroshky and I can't believe it took us literally that long!  "
,,,,,We visited twice the 3 days we were in Seattle and each time bought 4 items!  On this visit my favorite was the salmon spread and Hubby really enjoyed his Beef and Cheddar.  The bread is so soft and you gotta eat it fresh.  We did have some leftovers and it was still tasty the next day after popping it in the microwave.  
,,,,,Our friend who's from Nebraska said it reminds him of Runza sandwiches but better. The line is long outside but it moves quickly because the workers are fast and efficient.  Definitely not to be miss at Pike Place.  Average price about $8 a piece.
,,,,,My absolute favorite! Sweet or savory- its the best !
,,,,,A Seattle must !  Its always worth the wait !
,,,,,"Definitely a must-have when you're doing touristy tingz but also want amazing eats. This is a deli-counter type, so no ""dine in"". You simply tell them what you want and she will grab everything for you, put it in individual bags, and also give you a reusable tote if you buy a certain amount (big deal when you're in Seattle and have to pay for bags lol)."
,,,,,"I always get the beef and cheese, smoked salmon pate, and the potato one. My friend bought the hazelnut roll and said it was amazing, so I'll have to try that out next time."
,,,,,"Service is fast & efficient. Weekends, the lines can be hectic. During the week though, there's no line!"
,,,,,"Smoked salmon pate ($8) - if you like smoked salmon, you should definitely get this. I've never had anything like this before. It was warm and soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I was worried it would be fishy but it wasn't. "
,,,,,Beef & cheese ($8) - lots of beef and not a whole lot of cheese. It didn't have a whole lot of cheese though. I thought it was a little bland.
,,,,,"Overall, it's a bit pricey but if you like smoked salmon, I would give the smoked salmon pate a try."
,,,,,"I don't get it. We ordered four of them, and I tried two of them and they just seemed very bread forward and dry. I would have tried the other two but was disappointed in the two I ordered for myself. I didn't eat it immediately but after walking back to my hotel room about 15 minutes away. Maybe you have to eat it immediately for it to be good. "
,,,,,"Also, I felt very rushed in the small ordering area. I went on a Monday when they opened to avoid a long line. It was pretty quick at that time."
,,,,,"I've heard good things about this place, so I knew I had to try it when I was visiting Seattle! I went here around 6:11pm on Tuesday last week and there was a short wait."
,,,,,"Since it was my first time here and I was visiting Seattle, I decided to get a lot of these piroshkies! I got 2 Apple Cinnamon Rolls, 1 Beef & Onion, 1 Bacon Hashbrown Egg & Cheese, 1 Ham Cheese & Spinach, and 1 Chicken Curry piroshky."
,,,,,"If I were to rank my favorite piroshky to least favorite, it would be the Bacon Hashbrown Egg & Cheese, then Ham Cheese & Spinach then Apple Cinnamon Roll, then Chicken Curry, and least favorite was the Beef & Onion. I loved the Bacon Hashbrown Egg & Cheese piroshky because it wasn't too plain and was very flavorful for a breakfast item. My least favorite was the Beef & Onion because it was too plain and felt a little mushy to me."
,,,,,"I'd recommend this place! It's a great place to visit if you are looking for a quick ""grab and go"" meal, BUT it was a little disappointing that they didn't have some of the piroshkies I was hoping to order and try from their menu."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Wow! Wow! Get the smoke salmon piroshky! One of the best things that I ate in Seattle! They have a variety of other piroshky (European pastry) which were enjoyable as well. But for sure, get the smoked salmon!!! That's all I ask!"
,,,,,"Guess who's in town?  Piroshky Piroshky, a long-time popular spot in Seattle's Pike Place is in San Francisco!!  Just for one day tho.  I enjoyed their piroshkis in  Seattle, so when a friend gave me the heads up, I wasted no time.  All I had to do was place a pre-order and easily picked them up in San Francisco.  I believe they drove orders down all the way from Seattle. "
,,,,,"Minimum order was $50, but totally understandable, since they're making a special 800 mile trip out here.  I'm definitely more than well-stocked with piroshkis now, but I do like piroshkis.   "
,,,,,"There's a wide variety of piroshkis to pick from.  I just ate two during a road trip late this afternoon.  They're pretty filling but easy to eat in the car.  I really enjoyed the Chicken Curry with Rice.  The dough on this was very flaky and the filling was really tasty.  I should've ordered like 10 of these!  On the other hand, I thought I'd like the Beef & Potato most, but the dough on this was completely different, and overall it was just ok.  The dough wasn't the flaky kind and the filling was too salty.  Looking forward to going through all the many other varieties I have waiting for me.  So happy I could get these right here in San Francisco!"
,,,,,TIP:  $50 Minimum; Arrives frozen packed with ice bags and re-heating instructions.
,,,,,I was skeptical of the Smoked Salmon Pate piroshki but it was SO GOOD. I think the pate is mixed with cream cheese and chives so it's kind of like an inside out lox bagel but better. It wasn't too fishy and was just very savory and yummy. The service was quick but not rude or rushed. Definitely want to try some more of their menu items!
,,,,,"My husband and I were walking around Pike Place and we actually walked by this little bakery without the intention stopping...but after one whiff of their baked goods, we got it in line! "
,,,,,"The line seems to be pretty long, but it went by quickly! We had the perfect amount of time to look at the menu and decide on our order. I really liked that they had menus with pictures too! "
,,,,,"I had their Bacon, Hash Browns, Egg, and Cheese Piroshky and the size was huge! I thought it would be a good snack but it was honestly a meal. Lol, the bread was very soft and was stuffed with plenty of filling! However, as a person who likes to eat based on texture...I wouldn't order it again. It was a bit too soft and tender for me. I was a little disappointed because I was contemplating between this piroshky and the seasonal pumpkin...less learned, go with my gut next time. Lol "
,,,,,My husband had the beef & cheese piroshky and he really enjoyed it! It had plenty of filling as well and it was a great mini meal for him. Hahaha
,,,,,"I would say this is a must in Pike Place! If you can walk by, smell the deliciousness and NOT order...something is wrong with you. Lol"
,,,,,"This place is worth the hype. I went early about 45 minutes after they opened and didn't wait long at all. The staff is also very nice and friendly and talk to you while you wait and line and suggest other food spots based on your taste buds. I was doing a food crawl so only tried the egg, hash brown and bacon pastry but will be back to try the famous smoked salmon! Pastry was sooo good and fresh. Devoured it in 2 minutes max."
,,,,,"Russian hand held pies with NW influence since 1992! Check the website for pastries, frozen pierogies, and  seasonal offerings (currently Pumpkin Toffee Braid until Nov 30 & Korean Beef & Rice until Oct 31). "
,,,,,"Can order online and choose the pick up time, which is available starting at 9am. Went to pick up at 9am and easily found street parking and found no line at Pirosky Pirosky! Was in & out super fast."

,,,,,Located

,,,,,Thank you for the amazing detailed review! We love to serve you.
,,,,,First time to Seattle and heard this is the place to visit. We went on a Saturday morning around 9:30am and didn't have to wait in line too long to get in. The staff does a wonderful job moving people in and out quickly. 
,,,,,"The selections were overwhelming just because I wanted to try it all! We settled on the Smoked Salmon Pate, Chicken Curry & Rice Piroshky, and Potato & Mushroom Piroshky. "
,,,,,The breads are soft and pillowy with a crisp outer layer. The inside filling was hot and fresh. 
,,,,,"What an experience! If I lived in Seattle, This place would be hard to stay away from!"
,,,,,"There's always a line for here, even in the rain. The woman that is outside is very nice in answers all your questions. The line moves fast so be ready to make your order at the small counter."
,,,,,"Everything here is so good. We got the beef and cheese, cinnamon twist, chocolate hazelnut cream, and a special pumpkin treat. All were so good. If you spend more than $50, they give you a free tote."
,,,,,I always try to make it here whenever I'm in Seattle.
,,,,,"Overall delicious pastries! Tried things I liked and also disliked. We arrived at a quarter til noon and there was a long, but fast moving line. We were in line for about 10 minutes. There's a menu in line so you can be ready by the time you're at the front."
,,,,,"Best sellers according to them were the beef and cheese, smoked salmon pate, and potato and cheese. They have other items categorized under savory, veggie, and sweet."
,,,,,"I opted for the Smoked Salmon Pate, Potato and Cheese, and Chocolate Hazelnut roll. My favorite was definitely the Smoked Salmon pate pastry - very flavorful, strong salmon taste. The chocolate hazelnut was a great dessert. I did not enjoy the potato and cheese pasty. As much as I love potatoes and cheese... this was very bland. We paired our pastries with the chowder from  down the street. "
,,,,,"Service is okay, not the friendliest. But you're in and out of there pretty quick so it didn't bug me."
,,,,,"The bread was pretty standard, the smoked salmon pate was definitely a unique filling so I'm glad I got to try. But I'm not sure if I'd get it again...."
,,,,,"We went on a weekday afternoon so there was no line, but it might be better to go earlier in the day so the pastries are fresher. "
,,,,,Might come back to try some of the other pastries..
,,,,,1908 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Not as legendary as some others have stated, but still a very solid bakery and a nice stop if you're visiting Pike's and looking for a snack. Don't be too intimidated by the line. It usually looks long but it does move pretty fast. The staff here do a great job at making it as efficient as possible. "
,,,,,"I love the amount of options whether it be savory or sweet pastries. I will always go for savory but it's nice that they do both equally well, so that my partner can go for the sweets and no one is missing out. I tried the salmon and the beef + onion. The salmon was solid (maybe a bit plain) but the dough was just a bit too thick which I wasn't a fan of. Conversely, the beef + onion had a really thin dough which gave it a nice texture that I really enjoyed, and the meat was plenty flavorful. "
,,,,,"While I liked what I had here, I didn't see any amazing qualities of the pastries. I do think you should give it a try if you're in the area to experience one of Seattle's staples, but whether it deserves that title or not is up to you!"
,,,,,When I come to Seattle I always come here.  This place is located across from Pike Place Public Market.  Due to its location parking is scarce.  
,,,,,"There is usually a short line but it moves quickly.  Since the inside is very small, there is no where to eat inside."
,,,,,"I get the smoked salmon and the beef and onion.  I recommend both, they are delicious!  This trip I also got the lemon twist which is a seasonal special.  It was good, but I would not get it again."
,,,,,This is a must visit when you are in Seattle.
,,,,,"The place was a lot smaller than I expected. The cinnamon braid was alright, but nothing special. I'd say the Marzipan Roll was really good, definitely above the average pastry. Not too sweet and went really well with a cup of coffee. The smoked salmon, like the cinnamon braid, was standard."
,,,,,"Nothing was really bad about the food, but overall not extraordinary either. Probably won't be coming back but it's a good place to check out if you haven't before."
,,,,,"I have to try their savory pastries next time, that's what they are really known for but I wanted some sweet stuff. The French bakery next door is defintiely better when it comes to that. There was nothing really special or great about their sweets so I would not recommend it. But hearing everyone get their savory stuff, I messed up. Gotta come back here again to give it another chance. The guys at the register was super nice, so friendly for a Russian place."
,,,,,"One of the big hot spots in Pike Place Market that always has a line out the door. Don't be discouraged though, as the line moves pretty quickly! Would recommend you to take a look at the menu prior to decide what items you want as to not hold up the other eagerly waiting customers behind you."
,,,,,- PARKING - 
,,,,,"Similar to all the other spots within Pike Place Market, you're better off walking here or being dropped off by a Uber/Lyft."
,,,,,- SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT -
,,,,,"Yes, the staff will be yelling at you to keep moving but it makes sense as they just want to ensure there's no delays with the amount of people that come through. Small display case of all the options once you get into the small shop."
,,,,,- FOOD -
,,,,,"Smoked Salmon Pate ($6.85): One of the best-sellers, and for good reason! Great balance with the savory Salmon and slight creaminess from the Cream Cheese. I wasn't able to get this the first time I came to Seattle, so I'm happy I got to try it this time around."
,,,,,"Moscow Roll ($4.85): This was a disappointment, but maybe it was my fault for misunderstanding the description - it said this would have a Bavarian Cream inside, which I associate with a fluffy, whipped texture. However, the inside of this Roll was more dense and dried out."
,,,,,I also got to try my friend's Uli's Jalapeno & Cheddar Cheese Roll and that was VERY good! The Sausage had an amazing bite to it!
,,,,,- OVERALL -
,,,,,Worth the wait to hit a tourist destination spot and get some baked goods as you explore the rest of Pike Place Market.
,,,,,"Popular spot for savory and sweet Russian pastries by Pike Place. Came here on Saturday morning around 10am and there was a long line, but it moved fairly quickly. We waited for about 20 minutes. Credit cards/cash accepted. There isn't anywhere for you to dine in but the piroshkys are easily transportable. We opted for the Uli's sausage and smoked salmon (which was shaped like a fish!). You can split one or two piroshkys between two people and be good if you're feeling peckish. I liked both a lot, though if I had to pick, the Uli's was my favorite. "
,,,,,"If you buy over $50 worth of food, you can get a free tote bag. Bathrooms are available nearby in Pike Place. The line manager was very entertaining and lively. Overall, this spot is a must-do if you're by Pike Place."
,,,,,"This place is super well known as it sits right at the street of the Pikes Market and next to the very first Starbucks. Came here on my first day of my trip to Seattle and line was super packed. You should expect to wait in line. Since my friend and I really wanted to explore, we decided to come later. Got super lucky on our last day and we only waited 10 minutes. Can't say everyone will wait the long but good luck!"
,,,,,"We ordered two beef and cheese piroshki, one beef and cabbage piroshki and a jalapeño and cheese sausage. "
,,,,,"I've had piroshkis at a Russian bakery in SF, but it does not compared to this place. The bread is much softer, and everything tasted a lot fresher."
,,,,,"Out of everything we ordered the sausage was my favorite, which was surprising. The sausage was oozing with juices and flavors. "
,,,,,Worker was super nice and talkative even when they know it's going to be a busy day.
,,,,,"Dear piroshky piroshky,"
,,,,,I hope this finds you all well. I recently found my way to your location and was so excited to try your tasty pastries but was unfortunately disappointed by the quality that I received. 
,,,,,Your employee behind the counter was so enthusiastic that my expectations on the quality of your pastries may have gone up too far. 
,,,,,"We got the salmon pate and the cherry and cream pastry. The salmon pate was okay, not something I would get again but the cherry and cream pastry left me so confused. I took a bite and was immediately appalled by the flavor and texture. I ripped it open and found the saddest looking cherries that were shriveled up and discolored. We ended up just tossing it. ): "
,,,,,"Maybe we caught you on a bad day, it was a little later in the afternoon when we visited you all but our first experience was also our last during our vacation in Seattle, despite us going back to this area multiple times. "
,,,,,"Maybe we simply had the worst luck because the next day, we saw someone else eating the same cherry and cream pastry and the filling was bright red. It looked much better than what we got."
,,,,,"Regardless of what the case was, I hope that if/when I find myself at your location again that my experience will be much better. I was so excited to try your pastries when I was planning my trip!"
,,,,,"Respectfully, "
,,,,,Angel L.
,,,,,"We sincerely apologize that our service was not satisfactory for you. We aim to provide the most excellent customer service and carry our business with high standards. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we will ensure this does not happen again!"
,,,,,Definitely worth the wait!... go for one of the best sellers! Beef and Cheese Piroshky is so good
,,,,,Very hyped staple of Pike's Place! Line moves quickly and ordering is very fast. This was my first Piroshky experience and I tried two of their popular savory flavors: Salmon Pate and Chicken Curry. Each one was around $5+. 
,,,,,"Both were just okay, nothing mind blowing or exceptionally delicious. The Chicken Curry was flaky but a bit dry with not much chicken and just too much rice in the filling for my liking. The Salmon was good and creamy but a bit underwhelming... felt like it was missing something. Both were not as flavorful as I was hoping they would be. Overall, neither of them were bad but they just didn't have that special sparkle to make me enjoy them enough to justify the $5+ price tag. "
,,,,,"For the price and taste, I think these are just.. okay. I don't think I would find myself wanting to come back anytime soon but I don't regret giving this spot a try on my Seattle tour of the market!"

,,,,,This is a must stop and must try spot in Seattle!
,,,,,"We has to stop here to see what the hype was all about.  The hype is real here at piroshky piroshky.  Piroshky is a handheld pie with various filling.  There were so many options to choose from.  We ordered only the meat piroshky and were very satisfied.  We had the curry chicken, beef and onion and smoked salmon pate.  They all were very tasty.  There were plenty of filling. And I love how fresh the pastry tasted."
,,,,,The long will be long.  Don't hesitate - it does move fast.  Get in the line and get ready to order!  
,,,,,We will definitely come back here again!
,,,,,"It was alright.. Really wanted to try this place because of all the hype and really.. it's just all hype. Luckily the line wasn't too long and they were moving quick. I would've been pissed. I tried their famous salmon late and I didn't taste anything special about it. It was decent but it lacked some flavor and there was more dough than there was filling. Spinach and cheese was a 2/5, and . Don't think we'll stand I. Line here again."
,,,,,Don't think about it. Just go get one! Get two. Try something new. You will NOT regret it! I grabbed a beef and cheese and a hazelnut chocolate! They were delicious! The beef and cheese is savory and bursting with flavor! The hazelnut chocolate is sweet and decadent! 10/10.
,,,,,Piroshky Piroshky is located in Pike Place Market and is probably worth visiting just for the experience. My husband and I tried the piroshkis there about 10 years ago while visiting Seattle. I remember them being pretty good and was excited to hear that they were doing a pop-up in San Francisco. My family and I ordered several piroshkis (7 or 8 diff types) and spent about $130. 
,,,,,"Wow, these piroshki were terrible and so different than what I remember. The dough was super thick, bready, and dry af. The fillings were very sparse and didn't have much flavor. Every one of my family members did not like the piroshkis and we ended up throwing them away. This was such a disappointment and a total waste of time and money."
,,,,,"If you're in the Bay Area and want to try a real piroshki, check out Moscow & Tbilisi Bakery in San Francisco. I've been going there for years and their piroshki are the best in SF. I might be open to trying Piroshky Piroshky again if visiting Pike Place Market because maybe they only taste okay when they're fresh."
,,,,,"This spot has been around for 30 years in Pike Place Market and is a must try for visitors.  Don't be intimidated by the line, because it moves very quickly.  "
,,,,,"There are menus along the way, so just be prepared to order when you make it to the counter. And have a back up in case they sell out before you order.  "
,,,,,"When we went, the hot item of the morning was the smoked salmon pate roll.  Lucky for us, we had no interest.  The hubby ordered the hash brown, bacon, egg and cheese which he enjoyed though I found extremely salty.  "
,,,,,"I ordered the marzipan piroshky, which was very sweet but I'm a marzipan fiend and love the sweet almond paste.  My husband then had the Moscow roll which has a vanilla custard texture to it.  I thought it was pretty plain, but he really liked it.  "
,,,,,"I don't think I'll go back, but it's worth an initial visit."
,,,,,Smells so great but I agree with a previous post; seems like it's all hype. Or acquired taste.  Definitely not mine. 
,,,,,"The dough consistency is similar to empanadas.  It's basically Russian empanadas, y'all."
,,,,,I tried the:
,,,,,* Bacon Cheese Burger Piroshky - just get a burger 
,,,,,"* Potato and Cheese - how about we just get Animal fries from In N Out. Wait, do they have In N Out here in Seattle?"
,,,,,"* Smoked Salmon Pate - I love smoked salmon. But this... the aftertaste is definitely not for me. Too fishy and not the good kind. This is from me, someone who loves nigiri and sushi and smoked salmon. "
,,,,,*Jalapeño and Cheddar Cheese Sausage - pretty decent
,,,,,"The lady was like, ""YOU WANT 4?"""
,,,,,"Yes, ma'am. I want a bite of everything. "
,,,,,Shouldn't have done that. Waste of money.
,,,,,"This was a must try on my trip to Seattle! The Pike Place location is a small little shop with one way through- one entrance and one exit. I went early in the morning in a Wednesday so it was not crowded at all, maybe 2 people ahead of me. Service was very kind and the process was very quick. "
,,,,,"The pastries themselves were delicious. I got two of their most popular items and I can see why they were named the best on their menu. Inside the pastries were a nice, flavorful filling. On the outside was a slightly crispy but soft crust. The prices are a bit high but the pastries are huge! "
,,,,,I would totally come back for my savory pastries fix!
,,,,,Thank you so much for your honest review! We appreciate your support :)
,,,,,so freaking goood
,,,,,Love it sooo much
,,,,,Especially the salmon bread
,,,,,I love it soooo much
,,,,,The service is fantastic and great
,,,,,Will come back again
,,,,,There are so many people in there
,,,,,really funny pastry here
,,,,,I tried one
,,,,,It is super crispy and super good
,,,,,I guess you can pick anything 
,,,,,And it will not go wrong
,,,,,Price is kind of high though
,,,,,I have one question
,,,,,There are some other piroshky in Bellevue 
,,,,,Is it the same thing?
,,,,,So excited I got to try this spot! I had a sweet and savory dish and both were delicious. Worth the line which moved quickly by the way. I'll definitely be back for more goodness my next visit into town. I highly recommend
,,,,,"Am I the only person who is unimpressed by Piroshky Piroshky? The bakery has been around for so long that it's basically become a staple of Pike Place Market, but $6 for a very average pastry? No thank you!"
,,,,,"I decided I should give the bakery at least a couple of tries before moving forward with my 3-star review so here I am. There isn't anything bad about the pastry, but for $6 a piece you would expect there to be less bread and more filling. Or for the pastries to be more fresh and warm, straight out the oven type of thing. "
,,,,,"I wonder if the quality has declined over time or due to the pandemic, because what I've experienced each time felt like overhyped and overpriced pastries. Unless you care about getting a taste because it is a Pike Place Market staple after all, I would recommend skipping this one and going with something next door."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I was visiting Seattle for the first time and Piroshky Piroshky was my first foodie stop! 
,,,,,"For a Wednesday afternoon, there were no lines. I watched as the lines went out the door pretty much the rest of the time I stayed in Seattle. "
,,,,,There were so many great options! I chose to get the Smoked Salmon Pâté. 
,,,,,"The fish shape is so cute! The wild smoked salmon and cream cheese blended tasted great, I just wished there had been more. While I thought that this tasted quite good, I got parched by the end of it all."
,,,,,"Overall, great pastry! Wish I had the chance to try more during my stay. Next time!"
,,,,,"Very glad I got to try this Seattle favorite! We came around 6pm on a Monday and despite coming an hour before closing, every item was still available. There was no line when we went but I imagine it would move fast considering everything is pre-made--we were in-and-out in less than 5 minutes. "
,,,,,"I got the beef and onion piroshky and what was really impressive was how fresh my order was: I almost dropped it as I wasn't expecting it to be practically scaldingly hot, like it was taken straight out of the oven rather than the display. Not sure if I just got lucky or if this is their standard practice, but the temperature added a lot to my enjoyment. Since it's quite oily, I can see myself not liking it as much if it had cooled and the pastry lost its crispiness. The filling was also deliciously savory, although I wish there was an option to get hot sauce on the side as that would've elevated it even more. There was so much filling that it was more of a meal than a snack; at $8 my order felt a bit pricey but the large portion helps make up for the price-tag. I definitely want to return to try the smoked salmon pate next!"
,,,,,"This place was good. Quick service and a large variety of freshly baked goods. I personally think the items are overpriced, but given the history and work put into each traditional item, I can understand why that is. The store is small but popular and packed. Piroshky is definitely an easy on-the-go food. "
,,,,,Would recommend it if you are in Pike Place Market and want a quick snack. I was in and out of the store in less than 5 minutes (around 10AM)!
,,,,,10/10/2021
,,,,,Recommend? Yes.
,,,,,"This is right next to Pike's Place so it is very convenient for those walking around and shopping. There is a bit of a wait at times, but the lady working the line is such a character! She might own the place for all I know, but if she doesn't they should give her a raise."
,,,,,"When I went they had 2 vegan ones, veggie chipotle and potato and mushroom. I've never had a pirozhki before so this was the first time I've been introduced to one. I have no reference as to how it should or should not taste. I can only go off my personal preference. To easier explain it to ""mainstream"" tastes; it's like the concept of a hot pocket, Asian bao, Latin empanada, Jamaican pattie, etc."
,,,,,"I really enjoyed the potato and mushroom over the chipotle one. The flavors were mild. I didn't like the chipotle one as much because it has rice in a dough pocket so I felt that was just a bit too much carbs with not much of texture differences. Albeit the potato and mushroom didn't offer that much of a texture difference either, but I found the combination much better suited with the heavier dense fried dough."
,,,,,These are good even when cold. I bought a couple extras for my train ride. You should definitely give them a try. There's nothing to not like about them. I do hope one day they'll have a sweet vegan one.
,,,,,"Omg this place is truly incredible. The pie crusts were so soft, eggy, and crumbly that I was surprised because they look very sturdy and tough on the outside. I have nothing but praise for their soft salmon pate filling, it was absolutely divine and bursting with that good aroma, seasoned perfectly and melting as soon as I took a bite. "
,,,,,So glad to try this family-owned bakery on our short stay. The piroshkis which were kept nice and heated were perfect on a rainy evening! Will definitely be heading back to get some of their other baked goods to go for the road before leaving Seattle.
,,,,,"There were about 10 people in line when I arrived on Sunday around noon time. However, the line moved quickly and I was in and out within 10 minutes. I got the salmon pate piroshky which I would definitely get again. It's buttery, flaky and perfectly seasoned."
,,,,,"I also got the apple cinnamon roll which came with real fresh apple slices! This was also delicious. If I could only get one pastry next time, it would be the salmon pate piroshky (sorry veg friends)."
,,,,,"Salmon had to say it. We went there super early around 8:30 and there were 10 people in line, but the line went very quickly. They serve hot bread made fresh that morning from having a variety of flavors of savory, sweet to veggies options to try. I got one of their most popular ones, smoked salmon pate, it was super warm, a buttery pastry shaped as a fish-shaped, and in the inside was creamy that it reminded of a wonderful lox bagel. I honestly wished I got more bakery goods when I came to Pike's Place, but definitely add this place whenever you're in the area!"
,,,,,"Honestly, I came here with an expectation of how can a pastry be this good that every foodie recommended it.  But once I bit into that salmon pate prisohky, I wanted to slap myself stupid because its that darn good!  Nice hot and deliciously buttery. OMG"
,,,,,"If you don't love piroshky, you're probably a zombie!!! "
,,,,,The apple cinnamon being my favorite and their most enticing smell. It's the one that got me hook when I first came here/ visited. Then became a local and I still come here and wait in lines for it. 
,,,,,"The apple cinnamon: flaky, soft, crispy and juicy apple center with all that cinnamon! It's a must. Their raspberry cream cheese: another decadent one but this is rich and creamy. Perfect winter snack for walking the market. Beef and onion: savory, flavorful and you'll be full after one. Salmon pate: the shape itself is like a salmon! It's massive and it's pretty good. "
,,,,,"But apple cinnamon! It's the best one. And it'll literally stop you on your tracks, walk, strolls. The scent is just so enticing. The lines are not but good things are worth waiting for!"
,,,,,"One of the most highly recommended bakery at Pike Place Market. When we got there around lunch time there was no line which was a plus. Typically there is a long time. However, when there is a line, it goes move pretty quick. Everything came out hot, fresh, and delicious. They have a variety of bakery goods. Honestly, everything was delicious. However, they are pretty pricey for a snack. Would definitely be a 5 stars if it was a little cheaper but inflation is real."

,,,,,"Piroshky piroshky! The name refers to a Russian term that means pastries with various fillings and this bakery represents this to a tee. So many options in this bakery that it was very difficult to choose which ones to get. I ended up getting three: Moscow roll, smoked salmon pate, and curry piroshky."
,,,,,Moscow roll: pretty much tasted like a dense bread roll. Light in flavor.
,,,,,"Smoked salmon pate: great salmon taste, but the cream cheese was a little too rich for my liking."
,,,,,Curry piroshky: liked the flaky exterior. Curry tasted average.
,,,,,"Overall I enjoyed the pastries that I got, but none of them really wow'd me. I still like this bakery though as it offers items that are very different than the ones seen at other bakeries in bakery-robust Seattle. Add this place to your Pike Place itinerary! (Don't worry if you see a line outside of the bakery.....the bakery is grab-and-go style and the line moves at a decent pace!)"
,,,,,"Seen this place on YouTube. Decided to try it since it was next to the 1st Starbucks. We got the poppy seed roll & smoked salmon. Poppy seed roll was delicious, a lot of poppy seed, sweet & buttery. The smoked salmon reminded me of a salmon cream cheese spread. It was alright but in my opinion it didn't ""WOW"" us. But had to try since it was must on YouTube."
,,,,,"I love you, piroshky piroshky and have been coming to this very location since I was a tween. I especially love it when I don't have to stand in a very long line to get my baked good which was the experience I had. I went near closing and surprisingly they still had much of their offerings available. "
,,,,,"I opted for the apple cinnamon roll and it did not disappoint. Still warm, gooey, with perfect dough textures - I am now salivating thinking about this piroshky. My usual go-to without fail is their salmon pate piroshky but decided on a sweet one and it honestly never ever disappoints. Their salmon one has the perfect creamy salmon texture that isn't too overpowering and is cut nicely with some herbs. "
,,,,,"If you're in the market, just grab a sweet one to enjoy later if you're too full. You won't ever regret this delightful treat!"
,,,,,What can I say? It's a Seattle staple and one that was perfect in quelling the rainy weather after landing at SeaTac.
,,,,,"Recently I found out that they now offer two vegan prioshky options which meant my heart was singing. Both are savory - a Chipotle Soy prioshky and a Mushroom & Potato one, both at around $7 each."
,,,,,"Loved both of these options! My favorite was definitely the mushroom & potato option as it was a hearty blend of comfort veggies inside a golden, doughy bun. My partner who isn't plant-based enjoyed their smoked salmon prioshky and thought that was the best of the meat options they ate. Perhaps one day they'll be able to offer a sweet, vegan friendly option but I'm satisfied with what they offer now."
,,,,,"Don't be intimidated by the long line. It moves fast, and if anything, you're probably looking at the line for the 'first' Starbucks right behind it. Make sure you review the menu prior to entering the small shop so that you can order and get out of their quickly."
,,,,,"I read on Instagram that they were coming to West Covina, California. I placed an order to pick it up from the assigned location."
,,,,,They sent me an email that they were running a little bit late and extend more hours for picking up my orders which of course was a nice gesture.
,,,,,When I went the line was long and I waited for an hour.
,,,,,"Finally,I received my order."
,,,,,"The packaging was very professional, it was in a Piroshky Piroshky Box. The interior of the box lined by foam and have 4 ice pack with a menu of my order with storage and heating instructions "
,,,,,I ordered the following:
,,,,,smoked salmon pate
,,,,,"Chicken, curry &Rice Piroshky "
,,,,,Bacon cheeseburger Piroshky 
,,,,,"Ham, cheese and spinach Piroshky "
,,,,,Potatoes &mushrooms Piroshky (vegan)
,,,,,Moscow Roll
,,,,,Lemon twist
,,,,,Potatoes &cheese
,,,,,Chocolate Cream Hazelnut roll
,,,,,Uli's jalapeno &cheddar cheese sausage 
,,,,,Beef & potato Piroshky 
,,,,,OMG! I loved them all. The taste is so savory and really delicious.
,,,,,I enjoyed every bite of Piroshky pastries.
,,,,,I wish they could open a branch in California 
,,,,,Or have more tour.
,,,,,It was a very nice experience. I cannot wait until I go to Seattle to enjoy their fresh bakery.
,,,,,Wow. I'm speechless - Piroshky Piroshky 100% lived up to the hype. 
,,,,,"I got their beef and cheese piroshky which is a fan favorite. It was FANTASTIC!! It was so fresh, soft, and beyond delicious. The actual store is really small, but most stores are in Pike Place. I got here a few minutes after it opened and there was already a line of about 10 people in front of me but it moved really quickly. "
,,,,,"They have other piroshkys and pastries here, but their salmon pate and beef & cheese are the top favorites. I would easilyyyyy come here again and get the beef and cheese again, along with other of their various options. If you're ever in Seattle, definitely stop by Piroshky Piroshky!!!"
,,,,,I seriously LOVE this place. We've been going here for 20 something years. I used to go with my parents when I was a kid and now I'm taking my kids! 
,,,,,"My favorite things there are: (1) The salmon mousse pate. Sooooo savory and delicious, (2) The cinnamon cardamom twist thingy, and (3) the apple cinnamon roll. The apple is tart! Just the way I like it!"
,,,,,"During the holidays, they'll sell a larger version of the cinnamon cardamom twist thingy - shaped like a beautiful Christmas wreath!"
,,,,,"There's always a line but it goes super fast and it's worth the wait! They get ppl in and out quickly. There's no place to sit and eat so it's just all take-out. They'll package everything up for you nicely. On nice summer days, we'll take it to the park nearby (kinda behind the market, down the street) where there's picnic tables and eat there. Or we'll bring it home for later in the day. We like to toast them in the toaster oven if we eat at home."
,,,,,what is the hype.. why.. I did not like this at all. 
,,,,,There's always a line outside so why not try this place. 
,,,,,"I've got their potato and cheese and beef and cheese. Beef and cheese one was very salty. I didn't even get to finish it all. Potato and Cheese was just all cheese... price wise, it's super affordable for a meal or even as a snack. However, I was not a fan of the two I have purchased. I would honestly skip this place in pike place.."
,,,,,"Staff was super friendly and the lady that was tending the line asked if we had any questions, my only regret was that I only got one thing to try!! "
,,,,,"I got the smoked salmon pate and it was so good, the bread to the pate was just perfect."
,,,,,This place is an institution and a visit here is something that I salivate over when ever planning a trip to Seattle.
,,,,,"Anything with sugar in it is typically not on the menu for me and hasn't been for a very long time.  Not that I have anything against self-indulgence but diabetes is not in my life plan especially since it runs in my family.  Still, I am not a monk but if I am going to consume anything insanely unhealthy it needs to be amazingly good.  So......"
,,,,,"My mouth starts watering just looking at the display case.  I don't have any particular favorites and have yet to have a baked item there that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  Of course you can work up an appetite just waiting in line but anything this good is certainly worth cooling your heels in line for a while.  And, in fact, this is not the only eatery in the Pike Place Market area that has long lines."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,If you're looking for a sign for this restaurant then you will get lost. It is literally a pink door. That's it. Once you go inside you'll notice how nice the ambience is. If you do not have a reservation I would recommend coming in early to ask to be added to the walk in list. I went in around 6pm. And was able to get in. About an hour later they stopped accepting walk ins.
,,,,,This place is different because it just seems like a secret. Inside it has a little darker lighting which sets the mood right. When I went there was an aerial silk performance going on. The performer asked for no pictures/videos. I liked this idea because everyone was forced to watch and not be on social media. She performed maybe every half an hour. 
,,,,,"The food was delicious. I got the lasagna pink door which is their signature dish. I don't usually order lasagna cause I think it's too basic but this was definitely worth. My bf got the special with squid ink and he loved it as well. I thought the drinks were a bit too strong for me so I didn't drink as much as  I usually would. However, the dessert was delicious. I don't like a lot of chocolate however I love cheesecake. I gave the nutella cheesecake a try and I couldn't stop eating it. "
,,,,,This place is good but for someone who doesn't like to wait I would suggest going somewhere else unless you have a reservation. This is more a date night place.
,,,,,So I'm late to writing this review as I visited in July but I had to give this place its due write-up. 
,,,,,Such a cool place and steeped in history that it really is a must do/eat at if you are visiting Seattle. I heard it before going and decided to listen to the hype and go- so glad I did! 
,,,,,"Definitely make a reservation and do so weeks ahead especially if you want to go during prime dinner hours and during their special shows. We went on a Monday night and got to see the aerial performance- amazing! I have never had dinner and got to watch such a show, too fun!"
,,,,,"Now the place not only has a way cool vibe to its seating and decorations but the food is delicious! We split items and enjoyed it all- Caesar salad, Arancini, lasagna, and a special artichoke mouse type appetizer that was to die for good. "
,,,,,Pink Door is worth the planning ahead for a reservation and definitely worth the hype it gets!
,,,,,Authentic Italian food and nice interior! Better to make a reservation ahead of time.
,,,,,"Our server, Bonnie, was amazing! Very attentive, charming, and thoughtful! All of the food was incredible and came out in perfect timing The bartender, ! The ambience is romantic and cozy. Such an amazing experience and my new favorite WA restaurant! Thank you Pink Door! We will definitely be back for special occasions."
,,,,,"I was skeptical on why this was the #1 restaurant on Yelp around the Seattle Area. The food was amazing, can't put it in any other way. If I had to pick on something, it probably be the bread and oil they serve you before the meal. It was blah and just basic, - breadsticks from Olive Garden would be better."
,,,,,"The serving size and portion were generous, starting off with the Salumi platter that was bountiful enough to be shared by 6 people."
,,,,,"A group of friends and I went here for my birthday dinner and it surely did not disappoint. I got to try several dishes like the Osso Bucco, Salmon, clam Linguini and the star of the night, the Cioppino."
,,,,,Highly recommended
,,,,,I came with a friend visiting seattle. The staff was extremely rude and judging. They almost didn't accept my ID. Very unamused and disappointing
,,,,,"Amazing food and a beautiful view! The location is right off of pike place in the ally between two main streets so if you are not familiar with the area it may be a little tricky to find but as soon as you walk in you can tell the ambience is fantastic. The staff were friendly and wore masks at all times and they ask you to while speaking with them as well unless you are eating. The best thing we had was the garlic bread which sounds like it would lead to a terrible review but it was phenomenal! The meatballs were okay, lots of fennel to season which is not my thing but the bolognese was amazing! We finished off dinner with the Italian pudding which was a nice end so to a great night!"
,,,,,"This place was highly recommend by my friend and online. I was planning my trip to Seattle and was the most excited about this restaurant, however it was a bit of a let down. "
,,,,,Reservations were booked 5 days out for dinner but I was able to snag a lunch reservation. We arrived right as the opened. 
,,,,,We were one of the first to order since I had already read the menu prior to arriving (I was excited for it). We ordered our entrees then were brought bread. 
,,,,,I had only one special request through the entire dining experience and that was a side of balsamic for the oil and bread. 
,,,,,Unfortunately it was not brought to me until I asked another employee who dropped off our entrees. 
,,,,,My boyfriend ordered the lasagna which he loved! He was very happy and I thought it was really good too. 
,,,,,I ordered the clam Linguine Alle Vongole and I personally wouldn't recommend it despite the rave reviews. I thought it was bland like plain noodles with olive oil. Something anyone could make at home. I like my clams with flavor but these were pretty plain. My boyfriend agreed after trying it. 
,,,,,Maybe the experience could have been saved with a different menu item and if we were there at night during the performances.
,,,,,Absolutely tremendous. Cannot say enough good things. Our server was amazing and the food and drinks were on point.
,,,,,The Pink Door was amazing!
,,,,,"I've since recommended this restaurant to friends traveling to Seattle, and they too have enjoyed the ambiance and food experience that is Pink Door."
,,,,,"Coming down the alley, PD is not incredibly distinctive. It's a plain pink door, unmarked in any real way. Once we came in, we waited a few moments to be seated (we made sure to make a reservation) and were seated at the bar. You're able to pay extra for the burlesque show during certain hours, but we ended up just coming for the food."
,,,,,"By far my favorite was the bone broth and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts with bacon are well known in this area for being amazing, and the oyster we ended up trying was incredibly fresh and delicious. It was probably the best oyster I've ever had."
,,,,,Service was friendly and prompt and I most definitely would recommend stopping in if you're visiting Seattle!
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Probably the best meal I had my entire Seattle vacation. Felt really bummed because we couldn't get a reservation here but stopped in anyways on a Saturday night and they were happy to accommodate us. Our waitress was super friendly. This was hands down the freshest pasta I think I've ever had. I will be thinking about those noodles for the rest of my life. Also drinks were strong which is a huge plus for me.
,,,,,"This place definitely deserves five stars from me, and I'm not sure if I can articulate exactly why, but I'll try my best."
,,,,,"I came into this place with no knowledge or expectations, but I was satisfied with just about every aspect of my experience. The atmosphere was similar to that of fine dining restaurants I had been to before, but also didn't possess the pressure that made me feel uncomfortable that I was dressed like a software engineer. Of course this type of environment tends to prepare me to take a pretty non-negligible dip in my wallet, but I was pleasantly surprised when receiving the check. I wouldn't call it cheap, but definitely very fairly priced."
,,,,,"Now the important part: the food. This is the part I was afraid I'd have difficult explaining, but here goes nothing. I ordered a pretty classic pasta dish--pasta with some Bolognese meat sauce. How fancy or different can it get? But upon the first bite, I realized I was very wrong. I'm not entirely sure what it was that made that pasta so good. The flavors were just perfect, and the noodle itself was not only fresh, but cooked at a perfect al dente texture. I don't really have much else to say other than that I was very pleased with the dopamine releases caused by this food, and I will gladly go again."
,,,,,Lots to like about this place. Great location with some nice views in the Pike Place area. It is located on 1919 Post Alley between Stewart and Virginia streets. But note that the restaurant has no sign. Specifically look for the pink door on the west (water) side of the Post Alley promenade.
,,,,,This place is popular so expect it to be crowded. My wife and I ended up eating at the bar. 
,,,,,We started with the cheese board. Good mix of Italian cheeses with this amazing chianti compote. This also comes with their excellent housemade crackers. All good stuff and a great starter.
,,,,,"I had the chicken marasala with wild mushrooms. Which was cooked perfectly. The wine sauce brought a little sweetness that was nicely balanced by the mushrooms. Also had a side of ""Three of mama's meatballs."" This was perhaps the most basic of the dishes. Good, but nothing special.  "
,,,,,Service was excellent. Wine list decent. The added bonus was the entertainment provided by a trapeze artist. 
,,,,,You can make online reservations here 
,,,,,The oysters from the Cascadia region were some of the best I've ever had. They also were totally up for making whiskey drinks not on their menu. Great experience!
,,,,,"Atmosphere is beautiful. Cocktails are amazing. Food is always delicious.The vegetarian lasagna is the best I've ever had. Risotto is sooo good, and worth every penny! Perfect spot for a special occasion meal."
,,,,,"Loved everything about this place. Decor, ambience, service, food, and the over all experience were all exceptional! The rice balls were melting in our mouths while being crispy on the outside. The risotto was rich, full of flavors, lot of good cheese and good portion for sharing. The bread soup was fresh, hot, lot of veggies and could be a meal by itself ( it's listed under antipasti). The hazelnut cheese cut was lip smacking and a fitting end to the meal. They have live jazz music tonight and this enhanced the over all experience! Highly recommend."
,,,,,"I'm so glad my friend's made us try this place. Not a big fan of Italian food, but the fish of the day (Bronzino) and the veg lasagna were packed with flavor. It made complete sense why it's so tough to get reservation at this place. Also, I admire the fact how strict they are with covid guidelines."
,,,,,The ahi tuna crisp was really good. Great service from the bar and decent drinks. 
,,,,,The bread and dipping oil were also excellent!
,,,,,"DO NOT MISS THE CHANCE TO EAT HERE. This was a culinary experience I'll never forget. The Plum Hot Toddy, the rabbit dish, all amazing. The entrance is inconspicuous and the decor inside is bizarre (in the best way). I was seated at the perfect table for one on the patio tucked with a beautiful view of the harbor and the coolest mural. I didn't feel alone at all. My waiter insisted that I try the rabbit and I'm so glad that I did. The sauce that it was braised in was perfect. I haven't been able to get the dish out of my mind. This is a culinary treasure to Seattle. Thank you Yelp for recommending it to me!"
,,,,,"Once again, I leave The Pink Door disappointed. I ordered the bolognese - simple enough - and it tasted like something out of a Chef Boyardee can. The worst part was the music ---- it was terribly loud and obnoxious...... like 50s ice cream parlor rock, the same song over and over. The service was great. If you go, ask to sit in the back of the restaurant with the waterfront views."

,,,,,"This restaurant is a must when visiting Seattle! I've been trying to get reservations here for several weeks prior to our trip and was unsuccessful. I tried again the day before and found one @5:15. And I'm so glad we did! We had the Lasagna Pink Door, caesar with prawns, and clams/mussels plate. The service was top notch! Already planning our next trip in the spring!"
,,,,,"I've had friends raving about this place for ages, but I wanted to wait for a special occasion to try this place out for the first time. Finally, while planning a surprise afternoon out for my girlfriend's birthday, I remembered this place and immediately started looking into making lunch reservations."
,,,,,"The Pink Door is in the perfect location for people who are expecting to visit Pike Place. True to its name, the front door to this restaurant is, indeed, colored pink. Before visiting, I'd expected a more saturated pink and actually had to double back before realizing its actually a more light, worn out shade of pink. At this point, I didn't think much of the restaurant. At least, not until I went inside."
,,,,,"I was blown away upon entering the restaurant. The decorations and lighting in the interior juxtaposed the subtle door in the alley, hiding it from the outside. There's a stage immediately to the corner, which I'm told is for live music on certain days at night. There's also outdoor seating, perfect for the rare, summer nights we get in Seattle. We, however, were fortunate enough to get seated towards the back of the restaurant, by a window facing a breathtaking view the pier."
,,,,,"Service here was excellent. I'm particularly thankful to our waiter for being patient with me as I butchered through my order. I ordered the Mafalda con Dugo di Coniglio and my girlfriend ordered the Pappardelle al Ragù alla Bolognese. We also got a side of La Fettunta (garlic bread), although I'm pretty sure there is non-garlic bread on the house if you decide to get that instead. For drinks, we also got two grapefruit mocktails."
,,,,,"The wait wasn't very long, especially with the bread, mocktails, and conversations keeping us busy. But for however long the wait was, it was totally worth it. The Mafalda con Dugo di Coniglio was delicious. The pasta noodles were well cooked, and the rabbit was supple and melted in the mouth. The sauce, however, deserves a special mentioned as it was tuned to perfection. I typically can't eat too much pasta because of how thick the sauces are, but the sauce in this dish just right -- light, but impactful."
,,,,,"I had a great experience at the Pink Door. After finally visiting for the first time, I can finally understand the rave behind this place. I would definitely love to come back here again on another special occasion. Hopefully next time, I'll be able to catch one of those live performances too!"
,,,,,"The Pink Door has some of the best pasta I've ever had. I've been twice now, and both times I got a table for 2 without reservation and without waiting. However, we were not trying to view any of the shows they offer, so that probably helped. We did happen to come at the right time for the trapeze artist though. She did a performance that was about 10 minutes long, and it was very good!"
,,,,,"We first got the bruschetta, which I believe is a summer item, as it wasn't on their menu a few days ago (in December). Our waiter told us they grow the heirloom tomatoes for the bruschetta on the roof of their restaurant and they were the best tomatoes I've ever eaten. So sweet and juicy. We were sad to hear it isn't an all year menu item, but understand why. "
,,,,,"Both times I got the pappardelle pasta. The texture of the papparadelle is, in my opinion, absolutely perfect. It just has the perfect amount of chew and tenderness. The sauce they use also just clings the pasta perfectly. Topped with Parmesan flakes, it just doesn't get better than that. "
,,,,,"The prices at this place are appropriate for the quality you get. However, to me it's a special occasion restaurant because of that price though."
,,,,,"This place is like an institution for dates.  It's got great ambiance, good service and a fun festive atmosphere."
,,,,,Love this place!  The seafood was amazing.  Awesome service.  Great ambiance.
,,,,,"I was really looking forward to a great meal. The risotto wasn't bad but the bread looked soggy, charred and sad. I don't know how it gets charred and soggy. Maybe it was better fresh but it didn't survive the ride over. It would have also been nice to have a napkin or utensils with a delivery order."
,,,,,"A hidden restaurant in the Post Alley near the Pike Place Market. We actually had trouble finding this restaurant, since there was no signage and was literally a pink door with stairs going downstairs to the dining area. The dining room had a very good atmosphere with live music playing. We put our name down for a table at 8pm and was not seated until 10pm. Upon seating, we were brought bread by the server. I ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole which consists clams. The linguine has a very good texture and was most likely made in house. The clams were very fresh with a good portion size. Service here was very good and they were very prompt in refilling our waters and bringing us more bread. Overall would recommend for those visiting Seattle. Although, parking can be difficult in this neighborhood, since it's mostly parking meters."
,,,,,"This place not only has a great rep, but it can also back it up! I've come here a few times and I've always had great experiences. It is a pretty big space with lots of interesting features: aerial shows in the main dining room, live music, an amazing patio and inner section of the restaurant with gorgeous views of the water. This spot is really popular so I'd highly recommend reservations or you're easily looking at a 60 min+ wait. "
,,,,,"While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation. While the food I've had is good, it wasn't shockingly amazing. A solid 4/5 but you're really coming here for the overall ambience. I'd highly recommend coming here at least once to check it out! This place also is an amazing date spot!"
,,,,,"I'll admit, the location is a bit hard to find, but if you do, it's worth the hunt!  Upon entering through the alleyway, you're struck by the lovely ambiance of the location!  It's just amazing how looking from the outside in the alleyway, you enter and it's a new world!  The food is absolutely great, especially any of the pasta.  I personally tried the linguine and my husband tried the fish of the day!"
,,,,,"Highly recommended and hyped by multiple friends. The food is closer to 3 star but the ambiance, views, drink menus and live performances bump it right up."
,,,,,"Husband made reservations for the aerialist on Mondays. To view the performance, you will not have a view of the Ferris wheel. That's OK with us but a heads up. The performance was amazing. We were surprised that it's no photos and she only performs once every 45 min for about 5 min. However, they really dim the lights and turn up the music. It's one of the most fantastic things I've ever seen."
,,,,,"The food was OK. Husband loved the arancini but I wasn't crazy about the fennel flavor I tasted. We split the cioppini which I regret - we should have gotten something else. It was very bland and a bit on the fishy side. However, the lasanga was as fantastic as everyone says. It was luscious - soft and rich with a nice bite from the noodles. Highly recommend. The butterscotch pudding (budino) desert was addictive. However, bar del corso remains my italian hot spot."
,,,,,service was fantastic - highly attentive and we were not rushed. 
,,,,,"I would go back here for a drink in a heartbeat. Also, a great date night."
,,,,,"Definitely a must in Seattle! Was a little skeptical when I first made reservations because a lot of hyped places don't live up to the hype, but the pink door definitely did! "
,,,,,"A little hard to find with no obvious signs in post alley, and it is like half a block down from the alley entrance. My friends and I had a little difficulty locating the door but we finally realized the door to the pink door was... well.. pink. It was also 9:40 PM and really dark so maybe that's why we struggled so much. "
,,,,,"They have live music on almost all nights from 7-10 PM, and we got to sit right next to the band! They also offer seating in the dining room (which is fancier.... with white table cloths and such) but service is the same in the main room and dining room. "
,,,,,"Interior is pretty dark, so definitely good for date nights also! Service is extremely attentive, our server checked on us literally every 5 mins. Not sure if service would be slower if they were much busier, but we were very grateful for the great service!"
,,,,,"I ordered the rib-eye steak and also the bolognese. Both were SUPER delicious. The steak was $59 (market price, can vary) and cooked to perfection! I asked for it to be medium rare, and the chef delivered. Comes with mashed potatoes and two sauces for the steak. Absolutely delicious. the meat was super tender and juicy. "
,,,,,Bolognese came out steaming hot w/ beautiful presentation on a white plate. Comes with cheese on top. Would definitely recommend as well. 
,,,,,"There's also bread on the house, which is always a nice touch. Just make sure you don't stuff yourself with bread!"

,,,,,"Their door is pink and the food is awesome. From the door to the bread to the pasta, everything will make you wanting more. What more could you ask for?!"
,,,,,"This place is of course a Seattle icon, so I know I'm  not adding a huge amount to the discourse already in place about Pink Door. We haven't had a chance to see the floor show, so this review is for dinner on the upper patio. "
,,,,,"I think my favorite dish in all of the world's many dishes might be linguine alle vongole, so naturally, this being one of the restaurant's specialties, I ordered it with gusto. It's a particularly pure version of it here - clean and saltwatery and it feels like it could have been harvested from the sea a few minutes earlier. "
,,,,,The house antipasto plate was excellent. There's such a variety of delicious Italian offerings. I particularly liked the tapanada and the Tuscan bean salad. And it's so large that it almost ruined our dinner. 
,,,,,"We were a bit upsold on wine and the restaurant's door is kind of crazy hard to find, but overall a lovely experience and we'll be back."
,,,,,Tuscan fries are elite. Get that stuff. Pasta was also quite excellent. It was my first dinner post-COVID regulations and it was quite the treat.
,,,,,"Always a great spot for Italian food in downtown Seattle, one of the places that I always want to go to more, never super fancy, but everything is done super well, never a bad meal here."
,,,,,"Last time I came here, was after happy our at a near by bar and saw the distinctive pink door so was lured in. The restaurant is always a lot larger than you think, there are tons of table, with outdoor seating in the summer, and a lot of bar seating. At night its dimly lit so great for a date, and there are occasional entertainment, sometimes a cabaret, or during my night a jazz show.  "
,,,,,"The food is always classic Italian dishes done perfectly, never had a bad meal here, with tons of different type of dishes to choose from. On this night had a lobster raviolo and beef osso bucco, both great and would have it again. "
,,,,,"The service was great, very attentive, even though I came in really late and was one of the last customer of the night, there was not rush for me to get out."
,,,,,"There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here. "
,,,,,"If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely. "
,,,,,"I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints. "
,,,,,"The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed."
,,,,,"As many good reviews as you see, this place is nasty... just NASTY! Expensive and there are so, so many other great dining options than this. Food is mediocre, its the alcohol and ""the place to be seen"" that is the draw here."
,,,,,Such a great experience and incredible food. Highly recommend the Arancini and Penn Cove Mussels and Clams for starters! It was a perfect pair to start our meal along side a crisp Riesling and Mojito.
,,,,,"We sat at the bar, our bartender was so friendly, attentive and had support from other tenders. You could tell the workers were happy to be there and not overwhelmed despite it being a busy night. "
,,,,,The aerial entertainment was beautiful and such a nice touch to the ambiance of the entire experience. 
,,,,,"I love the hidden gem feel. The door does NOT have signage on it, you just have to assume it's  the right place because it's a pink door and it think that adds to the mysteriousness of the restaurant. It's very dim and cozy. Its truly just a great vibe unlinked any other restaurant I've been to."
,,,,, The cappuccino was a great ending as well! We will definitely be back!
,,,,,"Found this little gem by accident. The entrance door is literally pink, light pink :)"
,,,,,"Walking in, my first impression was ""why didn't I come here sooner?"" This place has a very unique, rustic yet chic look. Everything is very intentionally placed where it is. For example by the entrance there is a platform with lots of decorative grapes hanging with a vintage sculpture of a head of someone placed there. Or the ladies bathroom has about 15 mirrors on the wall and it's both purposeful and decorative. Very well done!! Plus the back room which is facing the water and Pike Place is just magnificent. It's an Italian restaurant yet it had a slight French feel to it because of a long French windows. Either way it's absolutely gorgeous. So bravo to the interio designer. "
,,,,,"We grabbed a table right by the stage with the piano and a lovely waitress greeted us. She told us the daily specials and she suggested the Pizza Bianca, which I immediately said yes to, and she also suggested the Whole Branzino, which again we said yes to. "
,,,,,"While we waited she brought us some ciabatta bread, if anyone knows me knows how much u love ciabatta, and some infused olive oil. WOW! That olive oil was incredibly good. I later found out that it's infused with rosemary, orange zest, lemons and black peppercorns. It was fantastic and so was the bread. "
,,,,,Then came out both the Branzino and the Pizza. 
,,,,,"They were both extremely great. The pizza has caramelized onions and red peppers. It was very tasty and super cheesy, how I like it. "
,,,,,The Branzino was fantastic!! The green sauce it came with was so delicious. The fish itself was meaty and very juice. Great job chef!!
,,,,,"Gorgeous design and atmosphere. Unique, co with views, hand painted murals etc. the door is excellent! We had the ravioli and sacral balls. Unique and original spices that work seemingly! Highly recommend!"
,,,,,We came without reservations.  Was informed the wait was 45 min.  But lucked out and someone cancelled and was seated in 10 min.  Had the Caesar salad and linguine vongole and bolognese.  They were all good!  Went on a Thursday and there was live Brazilian jazz so that was nice.

,,,,,"We have been here twice now and both times have left us plumped, happy, and anticipating a future visit. The first stop was in honor of the lil sister's birthday. The decorations around Christmas were gorgeous and I particularly enjoyed the anomalous black tree branches with peculiar ornaments looming over our heads. The decor in general is delightfully bizarre and reminds me slightly of stepping into Wonderland. The large windows in the dining room are romantic with the candlelight, views of the water, and the ferris wheel lighting up in the distance.  "
,,,,,"Both visits we've had fun and sassy servers who were intune with their gluten free menu items. Some of my favorites I've tried include the roasted garlic toast with gf bread..literally guys I have zero shame when it comes to extracting every molecule of that heavenly garlic from the bulb. The tuna crudo was amazing also, as was the antipasto. The first night we visited I indulged in the scallop special which was exquisite. The husband had the pappardelle and bolognese which I secretly coveted..so..the second trip, I decided that luscious bolognese was mine and they prepared it for me with gf pasta."
,,,,,The portion sizes are pretty substantial and we've yet to make it to dessert.  It's definitely a little on the pricey side but we found the quality to be worth it.  
,,,,,"Our second visit was with a large group of friends and we attended the burlesque show. The performers, including the host's improve, were excellent and had our whole group laughing and enjoying themselves. Between the food, great service, and the shows, we'll definitely be finding reasons to head back."
,,,,,"Celebrated my 25th birthday at the Pink Door, we were seated exactly at the time of our reservation. We were greeted by wonderful staff. From the complimentary bread, to the appetizers, and the main course everything tasted delicious. Had a couple cocktails and it was tasty. I cannot wait to visit after COVID is over because there is usually live music and dancers! Absolutely amazing restaurant!"
,,,,,"Kind of expensive, pasta was pretty good but not the spotlight. They have a roasted fig and ricotta appetizer that is one of the best things I've ever tasted though. Great for a date spot"
,,,,,"This might still be my favorite restaurant in Seattle. Reservations are highly recommended and don't worry if it's not at an ideal peak time., This is located right in Pike Place so you can walk around and even grab a drink or snack while you wait. "
,,,,,Inside it's pretty dimly lit but the decor is fire and the vibe is romantic yet chill. I ordered the lamb and it came with potatoes and green beans. It was DELICIOUS!! Flavor was on point. We got seated with a view of the ferris wheel too and got to see the sunset. Overall it was just a wonderful meal and I can't wait to go back.
,,,,,"Food was fresh, wait wasn't long and staff was pleasant. Sitting outside is a must! It wasn't that busy so above comments are expected hence the 4 stars."
,,,,,"The Pink Door was a little underwhelming for me. I had gotten loads of recommendations to try it out during my visit to Seattle, so I decided to make reservations for my birthday! The pink door's location is quite subtle. The door itself is a very light shade of pink. No signs. Really adds to the mysterious-ness and exclusivity of the restaurant. "
,,,,,"After entering, you're immersed into a dimly lit, but lively restaurant. I believe aerial performances take place during dinner time, but you need to make special reservations for that specific seating....I decided against it. We were seated at a booth  facing the large windows - which I'm sure during day time would be a beautiful view. "
,,,,,I ordered a clam linguine and it was lacking flavor. 
,,,,,"Our server was friendly, and although they don't do anything to celebrate birthdays...he still brought my dessert our with a candle."
,,,,,"We came here with some pretty high expectations after looking at various articles and reviews. We went in for lunch today after a 45 min. Wait. Our party of 3 had a few cocktails, squid ink spaghetti, bolognese and clam linguini. Overall it was extremely mediocre. The squid ink spaghetti was pretty dry and lacked flavor. The clam linguini was a similar story. I think the best dish was the bolognese but not by a large margin. Cocktails was subpar, and service was surprisingly slow. Overall I don't think I'd visit again, there are plenty of other places that offer better food with better service."
,,,,,"This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee."
,,,,,"Couldn't ask for a better restaurant to share with our friends from out of town. Amazing food, impeccable service, and our famous water views.  Short stroll from the parking garage too.  Well done, Pink Door!"
,,,,,I have been here three times and this is my first time writing a review. I feel that their service is improving in the past couple years. The restaurant is also getting more crowded that you barely could get a table on the same day. 
,,,,,"The linguine is considered as hard to me, so I would request softer noodle, and the taste is just right! Not too salty and nature sweet from the seafood. They also provide daily based fish menu that you might want to ask. "
,,,,,Parking is street park. Very busy during day time. 
,,,,,Note: 
,,,,,"1.) The house bread or garlic bread is not free. It is $6; however, I am not sure you could skip that part. "
,,,,,"2.) The portions of seafood are quite a lot, which means you might get a stale one."

,,,,,"5 stars for the food/service/ambiance. I've dined here on several occasions and every experience has been wonderful. My favorite dishes are the cioppino, lasagne, and chicken Marsala. The wine list as beautiful so many options and curated list of great wines abroad and locally. I brought in my own bottle of wine and our server welcomed it and decanted it. Then today, I dined here for lunch, my husband and I ordered a carafe of the house red and it was great too! Service is professional, attentive, and they take pride in their work and the food as if you were dining in their house...Great hospitality!! The restaurant is stunning and the views are amazing. Pink Door is one of my favorites!"
,,,,,Average Italian.  Hard to find.  Probably would go for the food again.  Ambiance good.
,,,,,"This is one of the best Italian places in Seattle. Especially if you are looking for one of those finer dining places. I wouldn't say this place is super fine dining, as it can be a little casual as well, but it is definitely pricey. "
,,,,,"We got a Cheese Board to share as an appetizer. For the price, I don't think they gave a huge quantity of cheese. But it is quality cheese. Only get this if you appreciate tasting different kinds of cheese, and I realized I wasn't that type. However the Pink Door Lasagna is unique to this place. It is vegetarian, but they make their pasta with spinach as well and layer not only with some marinara but with some pesto as well. This isn't your traditional lasagna, but it sure is unique and tasty. As a vegetarian, this is my go to dish here."
,,,,,"Overall if you are visiting Seattle, this is a great place to visit as a vegetarian especially to give the lasagna a try. Apart from that, it is a pricey place, but I could definitely see myself coming here from time to time if I lived in the Seattle area."
,,,,,"The ambience is great and the host and staff are friendly. However, the food was sub par. We ordered gnocchi, risotto and pasta. The taste was ok but not mind blowing. Dessert was just ordinary. I have eaten better and more flavorful Italian food and this restaurant did not meet the bar in terms of taste. For the hype, price and reviews, I expected more but walked away disappointed."
,,,,,Is it worth the wait? That's your call.
,,,,,"We walked in and found a wait, so put our name in and went elsewhere to grab a drink (bar was crowded!). After 45 minute, we grabbed a seat. My friend and I ordered oysters, brussel sprouts, and winter risotto to share. The oysters were so fresh and amazing. The sea salt was a nice touch."
,,,,,"The entree arrives and everything looks delicious. The runny egg in the hot risotto meant a heavier style. We loved it. The brussel sprouts were cooked well, with some light crisp. Amazing."
,,,,,"Between the both of us, we were filled with the shared food. The menu aired more on the heavier side. I appreciated the drink menu, with local crafts and wines. "
,,,,,"It's a more sophisticated vibe mixed in with some quirkiness. The entrance is non descriptive, we missed the front door and had to ask for directions. It's seriously a pink door."
,,,,,Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. The appetizers were perfection. Enjoyed them all and never made it to entrees. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"I couldn't get a dinner reservation while we were in town, but I was able to get a lunch reservation for 11:30."
,,,,,We got sat at the window looking out at pike market. It was really cute.
,,,,,It was cold out. We shared a lasagna and the cioppino soup. It really hit the spot for lunch. I was pretty full.
,,,,,The service was friendly. Would love to come back for dinner next time.

,,,,,"Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place.  So, I had to..."
,,,,,"But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find.  Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building.  Really no way to know how to get there without being told..."
,,,,,"and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those.  First, it's in an alley.  Luckily the GPS does hint at that.  BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?)  The door IS NOT PINK.  So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door."
,,,,,"Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance.  So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe.  Interesting."
,,,,,Food though is above average but not particularly great...
,,,,,"1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"":  Don't.  Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade.  Mocktail my ass.  1/10"
,,,,,"2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"":  I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close.  I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it!  Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping.  As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener?  Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special.  6/10"
,,,,,"3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"":  Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor.  It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants.  The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh.  The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist.  Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food.  Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served???  No toast, no nothing.  Weird huh?  6/10"
,,,,,"4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"":  Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising.  It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top.  I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert.  But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat.  6/10"
,,,,,"I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so..."
,,,,,"(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)"

It was our anniversary and we ended up sitting facing perpendicular to each other in a corner table. Unfortunately, since this table was not in the back dining room, there were people coming in grabbing take out orders. This part was just a huge disappointment and ruined the entire ambiance. "
,,,,,"The food was good, but nothing to die for. The beef short rib was alright, but really not that tender and frankly I've had better elsewhere. For a $30+ entree I would have expected better. "
,,,,,"The waiter offered us complimentary Prosecco for our anniversary and it was a nice gesture, however the two glasses were completely different shapes and the amount of Prosecco itself was comical."

,,,,,Awesome atmosphere and great deck.  Food is excellent and staff is top notch .  It's a Seattle gem
,,,,,"Corona season makes RSVP very easy for travelers who wants to try this place! Usually 3 month waiting list but was able to book within days. Very cute fine dining experience. Almost underground restaurant very elegant inside. Only complaint is they leave the windows opened so the food got cold quick. The free complimentary bread was delicious, very chewy and not doughy. The Caesar salad was nice, salad was not precut so you get to bite into very large slices of romaine. The grilled shrimp was delicious, comes with 7 shrimps. The croutons was seasoned well. The pasta here is cooked el dente; perfection! The linguine clams was delicious! No sand was in any of the clams!! The sauce is very light and fragrance. The Bolognese with the slices of Parmesan cheese is my favorite of out the 3 main dishes.  Sauce good. Meat good. Cheese food. The autumn risotto was good but a bit too rich for the size, get tired of eating it quick. It taste great, the mushroom sauce is amazing! But it would have been better as an appetizer than a meal. You must put your mask back on every time the waiters walk by. Only 90 minutes to eat here. Overall A+++ experience! Would go again to try the famous lasagna"
,,,,,"Came to this place after reading mostly positive reviews, but definitely should have looked more at the negative ones to give an accurate picture of where I was dining! "
,,,,,Mediocre food. Waitress was the most rude woman I have ever met in my life.
,,,,,"My mom and I were seated for 20 mins before even being acknowledged by the server, even though she passed our table about 15 times.. even placed the menus at the edge of the table to show we were ready to order. After ordering, we waited an additional 20 mins for our bread to come out. After noticing everyone that was seated after us was helped almost immediately, with bread and water provided mins of being seated and dinner already brought out to them we asked how much longer until our food would be coming, she said  ""I'm not sure if you're aware how fine dining works, but we bring out bread first then your main course"" reiterated that we were simply asking since it had taken 20 mins to even get our bread and been another 20 mins waiting for said main course. "
,,,,,"Anyways after eating we asked for the check and I pointed out to her that making a comment about fine dining, almost insinuating that we've never eaten at a ""fine dining restaurant"" was uncalled for and came off really rude and for future to just change her delivery, she was smirking and was so condescending, it was insulting. "
,,,,,"The manager came over after she walked away while I was speaking to her and seemed to be genuinely understanding as to why we were upset and offered to comp our meal. WHICH WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION, and we said it multiple times. We were fine paying for the meal and would have. "
,,,,,"So to the server wearing her fake pearl necklace and 50's stay at home mom hair do, fix your attitude. It's ugly and frankly came off a bit racist seeing as all your other customers that I saw you speaking with and interacting with the entire time we were there, were white ‍"
,,,,,"But the girl (unsure if you may use any other pronouns, if so I apologize) with the shaved head and colored hair, you were cool and were literally the only reason we had water and a even half decent time since you were extremely friendly! Thanks!"
,,,,,Best meal I had while coding Seattle! They book out far in advance so make sure you make reservations before you come! The grilled bread with olive oil was to DIE for! I haven't stopped thinking about it lol!
,,,,,"To start, there is no sign, just a pink door accessed through a small street/alley. Literally a pink door, I guess I didn't read enough yelp reviews. Luckily we were still able to make it on time for our reservation. We had a good table in the back with a view of the water. "
,,,,,"First thing to the table was the complimentary bread and olive oil, had to ask for balsamic, which had a tough crust that made my jaw tired. Next was the ahi tuna crudo which was awesome! A nice blend of fresh, citrus, smoke, and sting from the red onions. Then came the papardelle bolognese. I really enjoyed this dish, not too heavy but definitely flavorful. The papardelle was barely al dente but probably because it was thinner than most I have had, not a complaint. Finally, the roasted quail. The sausage paired nicely with the quail and farrow. My biggest complaint was that the balsamic glaze was too sweet. I did leave very satisfied."
,,,,,This cute speakeasy themed restaurant is such a cute spot downtown. They have amazing Italian and the staff is so nice and friendly. There's a cute outdoor seating area that's perfect for nice days and I recommend finishing dinner with gelato and espresso.
,,,,,"While shopping downtown, I called last minute and luckily they squeezed us in an open spot. Staff was all very accommodating and friendly. I've heard reservations can be tough in this undercover-ish tucked away venue, so we felt lucky. The vibe was warm and busy, but not at all noisy. This was a lovely hidden gem! Who knew all that was behind a small alley door. We tried a bit of everything, Linguine w clams, Bolognese, an onion and bacon bucatini, and a muffuletta. Everything was beautifully served and the portions were on target- filling but not stuffed. Crusty bread and oil served before the meal. This is definitely worth a visit. The only bummer was that being Last-minute Larry's, we couldn't sit near the beautiful water view or patio. That being said, every seat in the house looked charming. We didn't take one photo but ate every bite. Reservations recommended, but try giving them a call if you're there."
,,,,,"I am usually not a big fan of cheese but I loved the food here. Being a vegetarian, it had options for me and honestly it was delicious. Getting reservation was the hardest but then it was all worth it."
,,,,,We also saw some aerial performance there. Overall the experience was neat with happy taste buds!
,,,,,Outside dining al fresco is back! Jackie and her great team are serving socially distant dining on their outdoor deck. It's the best seat in the Pike Place Market. 
,,,,,"I've eaten there for over 30 years and guilty of still ordering my faves. BUT their side order of hand cut fries served with roasted garlic, rosemary plus sage and aioli is worth the extra calories. Just awesome"
,,,,,"Beautiful eclectic decor starting with the lovely pink door we walked through to enter the restaurant. We arrived here from the airport our first night into Seattle (without realizing how lucky we were to get in w/out any wait since it was late in the evening before closing), and it was such a wonderful welcome into the city!"
,,,,,"Gluten free garlic bread (toast) was available (a bit over-toasted for my taste, but still good), and I loved both the mussels and clams dish, as well as the seafood bouillabaisse. Both very flavorful, fresh, and not too heavy on the pallet. Of course, the panna cotta with fresh strawberries was fantastic and a great finish to a wonderful meal. And I look forward to visiting again next time!"

,,,,,I thought it would be appropriate to get my boyfriend a gift certificate to The Pink Door for Valentines (because Pink...lol) and I made the right decision. 
,,,,,"The service was prompt and nice, which if you have read any of my reviews that is hugely important to me. The ambiance was as expected (moderate noise and low lighting) and we got a seat with a view! I imagine that happened thanks to Seattle slowing down right now, but it was a nice touch. They also have live music which I enjoyed a lot. Our cocktails were amazing. The cheese and meat board was fantastic as well -- although I would have loved more cheese! The tuna appetizer was tasty but not breathtaking. Our entrees are what gives this place 4 stars for me. They were good but not great. The market fish was a little dry and had a very fishy flavour to it. The duck was good but the farro was a bit tough. And the winter risotto was pretty bland. "
,,,,,However! -- The dessert was incredible. We had the chocolate cake and I think it lasted a total of 60 seconds. So definitely give that a try! 
,,,,,"Overall, it was a pleasant food/service experience and I would love to try their lunch menu soon!"
,,,,,"During the planning stages of our trip to Seattle, I used the talk option on yelp to ask Seattle locals about their favorite restaurant and recommendations. I was pleased to have made new friends whom offered great restaurant suggestions."
,,,,,"Nick and I made a reservation online for Pink Door at 2 pm. Pink Door is  located in an alley outside of Pike Place Market.There is no sign on the door, so it is possible for you to walk by it and not notice it. The restaurant itself is very deceiving.The room at the entrance is used performances cabarets,trapeze and music shows. There is a bar that divides the main room and back dining room. The room in the back is much more spacious with views looking out to Pikes Place Market. The room was beautifully decorated with Christmas lights and Christmas tree."
,,,,,"Our waitress was very kind and recommended us all the good stuff. We ordered the Cioppioni Pink Door dish (prawns, mussels, clams and calamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth) and Pappardelle Al Ragu (pasta and meat sauce) along with two French 75 cocktails.Pink Door gives you complimentary bread and olive oil. The Cioppioni was delicious; the broth warmed you right up and the seafood is very fresh. Pappardelle had a savory sauce however Nick brought up the serving portion being too small as he was still hungry. The drinks were amazing ! We ordered a second round to keep the celebration going!"
,,,,,Service was great as they were attentive but not overbearing. Thank you to the Seattle locals who recommended Pink door to us! I can't wait to go back
,,,,,"On a busy summer evening the manager was able to get a table of 8 squeezed in with no reservations- initially we were quoted 1 hour wait. She made things happen and got us in in 10 min! Great service. Amazing food. The patio was cozy, warm and buzzing with happy Seattlites."
,,,,,"We went there twice on our 6 day stay in Seattle!! the Service and food was amazing!! Our first visit our server was Shaun....She was so friendly and knowledgable about the menu. We felt like we were old friends! first time we sat on the outdoor patio, overlooking the Sound, and it was wonderful. The next time we sat in the beautiful front part of the restaurant and it was So elegant!! The lasagna was amazing...as was the ahi crudo appetizer, the antipasto appetizer, the muffuletta sandwich and the cioppino were all excellent t!! We will be back as soon as we can!! Thank you Shaun, and the Pink Door!! You made our trip an amazing trip!!"
,,,,,It's located on Post Alley across from Kell's...another gem...no signage...just a salmon color door!!
,,,,,DON'T MISS IT!!
,,,,,The Pink Door was fantastic!! The food and service were excellent!! And not as expensive as we expected. We're going back for lunch tomorrow!!
,,,,,Keep in mind...there is no sign...but it's right across from Kell's...and it's a peach door!!
,,,,,My favorite place to take people who are visiting. It gives off a pretty bougie feel without breaking the budget.
,,,,,Things my friends and I have ordered in the past:
,,,,,"- linguine vongole- SO GOOD! This is always my go to because where else can you get that many clams when you order this dish??? Usually when I order this dish at other restaurants, they give me like 5 clams and expect that to be enough. Recently it's been a little more salty to eat than usual here but I still love it!!"
,,,,,- specials!!! Their specials are always absolutely delicious! My boyfriend always steps out of his comfort zone to try it. He recently got the squid ink pasta with seafood which he said was great with a sort of spicy red sauce!
,,,,,- salad- my friend ordered the salad with crab and loved it.
,,,,,"Can't go wrong with anything! Wonderful service, delicious food, delicious drinks, the only bad thing is it's always difficult to get a reservation. If you're visiting during the week, just come around 5 and there will be no wait!"
,,,,,"Edit: on reflection, what we experienced below was probably discrimination/racism as we're Asian American. Their pink door had a sign that asked customers to cancel their reservations if they were feeling sick ""out of an abundance of caution."" This was the only establishment in Seattle this weekend that we saw a sign like this. Also, my husband and I are both physicians. Completely healthy without any symptoms of a viral illness. "
,,,,,"Edit 2: read over the bad reviews and interesting thing to note is many of them mention racism experienced by Asians/Asian Americans which is actually not normal by any means. This is not a good trend to have whatever star rating you have--it doesn't give you a free pass to be racist. Also, I saw how the management responded to one Yelper who called them out on being racist - that response is very revealing and disappointing. Didn't apologize at all, acting very high & mighty bragging about their high ratings. Will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone."
,,,,,Original review:
,,,,,"We're from out of town and had high expectations of the food only to be sorely disappointed by many things. First, taste wise it was average - definitely had better (I got the pappardelle w/ meat sauce and my husband got agnolotti oxtail)."
,,,,,Worst thing is our waitress really rushed us throughout the whole time asking every 2min if we were ready to order and I felt she started to give attitude when I asked simple questions about the items on the menu. She also took away our dishes too early.
,,,,,We thought about the getting dessert at the beginning but changed our minds quickly as the service became obviously underwhelming--unsurprisingly we were also never offered to get desserts.
,,,,,You're paying a hefty price mostly for the ambiance. If that's what you want (without even the proper time to enjoy/savor it) then hand over your paycheck please.
,,,,,This place is hard to find but it's worth the look. I literally passed this place while walking through the alley. The restaurant is literally a pink door. Once inside though it is nothing like what I thought it would be like. It is definitely a date night place and or just a place to just come and relax. The food was amazing and the portion sizes were just as amazing. Do yourself a favor if you are ever in Seattle after this whole pandemic has passed by and stop by the pink door. The flavors of the seafood dishes that we had was excellent and the customer service was just as good.
,,,,,It's gorgeous out. All the local restaurants are seating people outside. There's a pandemic on and These guys refuse to seat anyone outside. What are they thinking?
,,,,,"Wasn't the best pasta I've ever had but the ingredients were fresh, the balance was there and the service was great. I ordered the House Spritz and they POURED up the Campari, one drink had be quite buzzed. I would recommend mixing it once you get it or you are gonna be sipping on pure liqueur for a minute.  All in all a great experience! Beautiful view outside"
,,,,,Finally got to try this place and it exceeded all my expectations! I really loved everything about this place. From the moment you find that cute pink door to walking down to the bar area - the ambience of this place feels so classy yet homey. 
,,,,,We thankfully got a day of reservation because we went in around 5pm before the dinner rush! We first sat at the bar to get some drinks while they were setting up our table and the bartender was super nice and the cocktails were delicious! Already a big plus. 
,,,,,"They also gave us one of the window seats by the dining area room in the back with the beautiful view of the water and the Ferris wheel! That room was so lovely. Now onto the food, we ordered the special selection of the squid ink pasta and the pappardelle and wowwww it was so good! The flavor and the pasta was cooked to perfection! Not sure if I was pleasantly surprised because I just had a really bad experience at a popular Italian restaurant but it was so delicious!!"
,,,,,"Service was exceptional as well! Seriously, I can go on and on about how much I love the Pink Door. I'm a huge fan and can't wait to go back for more over & over again!! Can't believe it took me THIS long to finally try it and it did NOT disappoint! Thanks Pink Door!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I was extremely impressed by this place. I started off with the cheese platter. This was amazing. Everything was paired off nicely. It felt like every type of cheese I ate was a new experience. A must get. Just wish there were more crackers. 5/5
,,,,,The mama's meatballs and rigatoni were very good. Pasta al dente and probably made in house. It's very rare that I like a tomato sauce. I normally just eat a little bit but I wanted more. Meatballs were good but I thought they were a little bit plain. 4.5/5
,,,,,Pan cotta with chocolate and coffee flavors infused. I remember the whip cream was covered in a little bit of cinnamon sugar. The consistency is of a gel flavor but it's so easy to swallow 5/5
,,,,,"Best Italian restaurant in Seattle! Aside from their amazing food, The Pink Door's COVID precautions made my friend and I feel very safe. Their pasta dishes are amazing-you can definitely taste the freshness. Can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,"Bread with infused olive oil ! Wine! Atmosphere! Must try the arancini, lasagna, linguini and fries with the best homemade aioli. Such a great hidden gem to find in a fun pocket of Seattle."
,,,,,"We had the most amazing dinner today. This establishment is top of its class. It is elegant, has an amazing ambiance, excellent service and food it's world class. We had the house antipasto as an appetizer. I had the pasta bolognese and my friend had the Risotto as an entree. We also ordered a great bottle of Malbec. For dessert we order the basil cake (wow was that a very pleasant surprise) and the limoncello. It was all so amazingly fresh and just very tasty and delicious food. Our server was Maria and she hit the service out of the park. At a time when service is lacking all of over, Maria amazed us with the highest quality service I have experienced in a a very long tome. I do think that this restaurant is easily the best in Seattle."
,,,,,"Our dinner date here was a fabulous experience. Make reservations as they are situated in Pike Place and are a hot favorite among the locals too. Everything on their menu is really good. The staff was super cheerful too and the ambience, just perfect."
,,,,,"Finally had the chance to check this place out and I'm glad I did! Many people rate this place as Seattle's best pasta, and while I don't quite agree with that, it's pretty high up on my list. The Pink Door offers premium pasta in a cool little hard to find spot - meaning it's literally a pink door in an alley without any signage outside. Prices may be high but the food quality here is top notch!"
,,,,,"We ordered the Antipasto of the house (salami appetizer dish), the lasagna pink door, and the linguine alle vongole. The antipasto was a good appetizer and cool to eat, but a bit on the salty side. My girlfriend loved the lasagna but to me it tasted like any other lasagna I've had. The linguine was my favorite. You can really taste the wine flavors in it and it comes with a TON of clams. Portion size here on everything is decent, but remember you're paying for the quality. "
,,,,,"The service here rocks. Our server was extremely attentive and helpful during our meal, and my water was filled at least 8 times (I drink a lot). She even helped out with a birthday surprise and recommended us an awesome dessert! Everything about this place just really gives you a satisfying feeling when you dine here."
,,,,,"Overall, It's a little hard to get to if you're not already in the downtown area, and there might be a long wait (reservations get booked pretty far in advance for dinner so I recommend coming for lunch instead), but the Pink Door is a place you should try at least once if you're in Seattle."
,,,,,"The reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the two ladies who worked at the front and making reservations for people were quite rude and unwelcoming. Even though there was no one else in line, they seemed in a rush to get me and my friends out of the way. I was immediately taken aback and probably would've left if I didn't hear such great reviews on this place."
,,,,,"But I'm so glad I didn't leave! The waiter, on the contrary, was super friendly and helpful. Don't be fooled by the odd location. P.S. It's behind an alley way and actually has a pink door haha! Hands down my favorite place to eat in Seattle - from the delicious food (I got the bolognese which had a small portion but don't be deceived... it was very filling) to the ambience (which included live music) to the interior design. "
,,,,,I would definitely recommend putting your name down EARLY! We went on a Thursday night and it was still about a 1.5 hour wait. They give you about 10 minutes to claim your spot after they text you.
,,,,,Great meal! Great service! Best meal in Seattle! 
,,,,,Highly recommended!  Glad I chose this to celebrate our wedding anniversary!!
,,,,,"I really enjoyed my experience at the pink door! The waiter was absolutely fabulous, ambiance was very home-like and most importantly, the FOOD WAS SO GOOD! I came here around 2pm after exploring the space needle and glass museum for a late lunch. "
,,,,,We got three dishes:
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,- LINGUINE ALLE VONGOLE 
,,,,,- PENN COVE MUSSELS AND CLAM 
,,,,,- CIOPPINO PINK DOOR 
,,,,,All of the dishes came out to be around $21-$23 and the total check with tax and tip was around $86 which I thought was reasonable just because I could definitely taste the quality of the food and the service was superb!
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Linguine Alle Vongole - this is filled with an abundance of baby clams and yummy linguine at the very bottom of it all. I got this dish because it seemed like one of the Yelp favorites. Although not my favorite of the three, it was also not a bad decision. "
,,,,,Penn Cove Mussels and Clam - THE MUSSELS HERE ARE AMAZING. So amazingly fresh and delicious! This is a must try and a dish that I would definitely order again.
,,,,,"Cioppino - I had cioppino at another restaurant in Seattle but I was only recently introduced to the dish itself (shocking). Although the other restaurant where I tried the cioppino included more seafood, the soup of this dish trumps the other restaurant I went to. This dish could get a bit salty but if dipped with bread, it is pure greatness. This is probably my favorite dish because of the soup base."
,,,,,All the tales are served with bread and olive oil. We asked for vinegar separately to compliment the oil and the server happily and readily got some for us. 
,,,,,I would love to come back here again if I am ever in Seattle again. Someone recommended I try the lemon drop as well so I definitely want to try that next time.
,,,,,"I recommend everyone to try the Pink door once at least for the Pike Place's atmosphere. But I came here mainly for the food. The restaurant located in Post Alley, It was hard to find. The door was not bright pink, it was more like pastel pink or beige. The restaurant was decorated like a mobile circus, it was very interesting to me. Service was nice and fast. The servers are knowledgable about where the food came from. Most of the ingredients were from local. The two pasta I ordered were delicious and good portions. They were not too salty which I like, and I love the garlic taste in my food. Overall, good experience, I will be back."
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Food  and atmosphere is amazing definitely one of best experiences I've had awhile. However, I'm taking away one star due to unpleasant customer service. "
,,,,,My friends treated me here to birthday dinner last Thursday and I realized I forgot my wallet after business hours. Today is the first day I've been able to get ahold of a person at restaurant since Sunday night. This obviously not there fault given that hours this week were modified due to the Holiday weekend and sure Covid plays a role as well. 
,,,,,"When I called to ask about my missing property I said ""Hey, would you mind checking if left my wallet at your restaurant, I was there on Thursday"". Angelica (who's apparently a manger) reply's ""Thursday? As in yesterday?! That's was Thanksgiving so it's impossible"". Her tone was extremely condescending and I guess she assumed I too wasn't aware that yesterday was National holiday  -- I explained to her that I was referencing last week and instead of apologizing right then she says ""I guess I'll take a look"". They did in fact have my wallet (!!) and once she realized she was wrong she was more accommodating. I do not appreciate the the dismissive nature nor the insult of intelligence. On top of the non existent remorse until I called back and comforted her about it. She clearly knew she was in the wrong because when called back she stated off with ""hi, I spoke to earlier"", that's universal code for anticipating some kind of conflict. "
,,,,,"I eventually spoke to the owner and while she nicer she too was rather dismissive and continued to stick up for her employee (Angelica) but, it was clear that she didn't know nor care to understand the entire interaction. Her message was just that it's busiest time of year and it's impossible to be nice 24/7. I'm a former hostess of Purple Cafe & Wine Bar whom recently left the industry a few months ago and despite the circumstances such behavior is never to be tolerated by my management nor the owners. "
,,,,,"Especially when I was nothing less than polite, patient, and understanding. In my days on the floor I'd experience angry voicemails and colorful choice words from guests who found themselves in similar instances and, I still never acted outside my job description. "
,,,,,"Overall, would highly recommend the restaurant as it's meal I'll never forget. Maybe just stir clear on busy nights (weekends/holidays) as apparently that's a justified reason for customer service to be less than satisfactory."
,,,,,"New favorite place!!! Good food, good vibe, great location. Post Alley is the cutest hidden gem at Pike Place. "
,,,,,I had the pappardelle balognese and my friend had the pink door lasagna. The pasta was definitely made fresh and it was sooo good! They had a nice little jazz band performing during dinner and it was PERFECT! Service was amazing too! Definitely coming back here again!
,,,,,"This restaurant itself was beautiful and a unique dining experience in Seattle. However, their website is confusing and not always up to date. I heard about the burlesque show on certain Saturday evenings and checked back frequently and it sold out fast. Also knowing when they serve lunch vs. dinner was odd to me as well. But other than that, the service and the food were delicious! We ate in the back room with a view of the water and Pike Place. "
,,,,,"I ordered the stuffed meatball baguette which was really filling. The meatballs were very tasty. My sister had the Ahi Tuna dish and enjoyed it as well. Their cocktails were also delicious and had some unique twists on regular drinks. Loved their version of the old fashioned. Our waitress was very friendly. Little pricey, it can add up with rounds of drinks but treat yourself if you're visiting!! Wish I could have seen some of the entertainment that's advertised all over their website, but there is always next time..."
,,,,,"If you're expecting a sign to find The Pink Door, don't expect it! Look for, as the name implies, The Pink Door! This restaurant was surprisingly larger than I expected and was both classy and quirky with it's artwork. "
,,,,,"l got the Linguine Alle Vongole and it was delicious! It came with a large amount of small clams, which I was very happy about and thought that the portion size was perfect. The meal was a little bit on the pricier side for a lunch ($21), but I think it was well worth it. There was also complimentary bread and olive oil for dipping. The olive oil was so yummy. "
,,,,,"The service was great and the staff was friendly, but do take note that it will take a bit longer to eat here as it is a sit down restaurant. As a party of 7, we didn't call in for a reservation and instead split into two smaller tables which took just a few minutes to seat. "
,,,,,"Overall, had a great meal at The Pink Door."
,,,,,"From trying to find the entrance to the restaurant to polishing off the last bite of our amazing Panna Cotta, it was a true adventure! "
,,,,,I had this place bookmarked for my anticipated Seattle trip weeks in advance because the food looked great and the reviews on the ambiance peaked my curiosity. Good job yelpers! 
,,,,,The pink door of the restaurant is not hard to find but there isn't an clear signage of the restaurant except a small pink plaque on the wall with hours of operation. There is a small speak easy vibe to it and I don't hate it all all. We went for a super late lunch around 330p and the place was busy for that time of day. We did not make reservations however we were able to get seated right away. However if you want to do the Cabaret and dinner- tickets/reservations are required. 
,,,,,"For food- we started with the roasted garlic to share. Two full bulbs of roasted garlic, abundant amount of bread and a side of cheese as accompaniment. For main course we ordered the Ciopino, linguine with clams, and the 3 meat balls. Everything was amazing! We were literally sopping up the broth and sauces not to waste anything. We were debating on getting dessert there or not but- once we saw the dessert menu, we couldn't say no to the Panna Cotta. Infused with bay leave and covered in sweet strawberries, it was perfection. "
,,,,,Please don't go to Seattle without eating here. It is 1000% percent worth it. I can't wait to come back to try all the other dishes and even the cabaret!
,,,,,"I have been wanting to come to this place but couldn't get reservations but was lucky enough to get same day reservations at 10pm last night. I was worried the restaurant would be getting ready to close but it was still very lively when we got there with a live band just finishing up their set. We had a table outdoors and being from LA, I was afraid my thin skin would be cold but after a few sips of our delicious cocktails, I forgot we were outside. We ordered the squid ink pasta and lasagna and the food was delicious. The lasagna was one of the best I have ever had and the squid ink was perfectly cooked. For dessert we got the raspberry basil cake which sounded like an odd combination but it was surprisingly tasty with a hint of savorness. The service was also great, our server was very accommodating with having the bartender create the perfect birthday cocktail for me. He also stuck a candle on top of the cake and helped make our visit a very enjoyable one."
,,,,,Lovely Italian food on a sunny perch above Pikes Place Market. Recommend the lasagna and the Bolognese. Hearty but not crazy big portion sizes.
,,,,,"Pretty hipster spot with a pink door. Food here was pretty decent, but on the expensive side."
,,,,,"Came here based on the recommendations from multiple friends, but was a bit disappointed with the entrees. Got the Lasagna Pink Door and Linguine Alle Vongole. Both were just okay and honestly felt expensive for what we got. Flavor was not outstanding and food did not hold up to my expectations. Otherwise, service was good and they took covid precautions seriously."
,,,,,"If I could give negative stars I would, but it has nothing to do with the food since my party never sat down."
,,,,,"Last Thursday, we had just driven into Seattle and were looking for good recommendations for dinner when we came across this restaurant. We went in knowing that there would probably be a wait. The hostess greeted us and let us know that it would be about an hour. Our party agreed to wait, so she started taking down our information."
,,,,,"Then another staff member walked up behind her and said, loudly and with an attitude I might add, ""Did you TELL THEM it was OVER AN HOUR wait?"" And the original hostess said, ""Yes, but they want to wait,"" and continued to take down the information. Then the staff member gave us a demeaning look. "
,,,,,"It was simply unprofessional and I refused to return. When we were told the table was ready, we cancelled it. We can take our business elsewhere where people can treat customers kindly."
,,,,,"I don't know if it was a race thing or something personal was going on, but I was pretty offended."

,,,,,"Today was a ""take your chance"" experience when it came to stopping by for dining. We were told to come back in 30 minutes to see if we were luckier the second time around. Turns out we were. Yay! Our server was great and the food was delicious. The wine was expensive but we're on vacation, so why not? The ambiance is super cute and the decor is a nice whimsy (we loved it). What I didn't love was the ""Justice for George Floyd"" cocktail. I had to do a triple take! I mean, tacky much? Profiting off George Floyd's murder is beyond disgusting and another example of white society making something small out of a grave injustice. For a classy restaurant, this act is classless - it's offensive and devoid of emotional and cultural intelligence. I'm sorry to give this fine restaurant a two star rating, but I had seriously considered giving it one star. I hope this drink is promptly removed. Thank you."
,,,,,"This place is so stinking cute! The hostess was so kind and polite and was able to squeeze us in for the evening, as long as we were quick that way the next reservation could come in. We were perfectly fine with that because we knew that we weren't going to be long and we really wanted to try this place as we were visiting Seattle for the day. The back outside area has a great view of the water and sunset. It is a little bit hidden which just adds to the cuteness of it all."
,,,,,Amazing food and serivce. Ashley gave wonderful recommendations. Best place I have ate in Seattle hands down. A low key gem that every local and tourist MUST try.
,,,,,"Badass! That was my first impression of the Pink Door. Walking through the doorway and seeing the large dining area, the 3 piece jazz band and realizing that we were being sat on the patio with a view of the water. Just badass!"
,,,,,Every dish we had was delish! The bruschetta was great because the tomatoes were perfectly ripe. The muscles and clams was a huge portion that my friend and I could even finish because we devoured the Bolognese.
,,,,,Come here! You will love it!
,,,,,We went for lunch because they were booked for a month for dinner reservations. The food and view on the patio was so wonderful and a highlight of our trip to Seattle. We had clams and some of their signature cocktails. 
,,,,,"Despite the great lunch, we wish we had planned ahead and figured out how to sneak in a dinner there. Apparently the show is fun and exciting!"
,,,,,Waitstaff was super nice too!
,,,,,The ambience and staff was perfect! Its the most lovely place for a date night - both the seating and setting inside and outdoors.
,,,,,"Enjoyed most of the items we were recommended- the Pinot Noir went perfectly with the Lasagna Pink Door. Unfortunately the garlic bread was not the freshest and was chewier than we like it. The infused oils in it were nice though! From alot of reviews and recommendations which said it was not too sweet, we ordered the basil cake for dessert but it was extremely sweet for our taste even without the butter cream frosting. And i dont think my palate enjoyed the basil flavoured cake. All in all it was a 4/5 night."
,,,,,It was my first time in Seattle so naturally I had to swing by The Pink Door.
,,,,,Started off with a refreshing cocktail that had coconut milk and rum in it I believe.
,,,,,"Down to business though...the pink door lasagna was very very good. The layers of spinach pasta made the taste very unique. There was a perfect amount of sauce topped on. Despite it being a lasagna dish, it doesn't leave you feeling too heavy. Ambiance is delightful and location is great for first time tourists like me to try it out."
,,,,,"Really good - would highly recommend if you are in the area of the Pike Market --- food was really delicious. I had Risotto, my son had lasagna and husband had pappardelle - everyone was pleased."
,,,,,One of our top restaurants to eat at for lunch after exploring Pike Place Market! The balcony is a great spot to sit too when the outdoors is welcoming and there are available seats.
,,,,,"My favorite so far is the Linguine Alle Vongole: baby clams in the shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis and white wine ($21)."
,,,,,"The white wine sauce is light and refreshing, while the pancetta and garlic gives the dish that essential flavor. Clams are always fresh and an adequate portion is served."
,,,,,"Downtown Seattle's Pikes Public Market area has so many culinary choices to chose from.  However, based on the number of outstanding ratings and reviews, the restaurant that stands out the most is Pink Door."
,,,,,"Location is very unassuming.  A single solid pink door on a no window building in an alley.  We passed by it a few times without knowing, which made it that much more fun.  We sat on the outdoor patio with a peek a boo view of the water, but as the weather was so mice, the multitude hanging bouquet of flowers more than suffice."
,,,,,Hospitable hostess and server and a simple menu makes dining even more pleasant.
,,,,,"Dungeness crab Caesar salad: topped off with a very generous helping of shredded crab.  In my experience, typically a bit fishy, but this time, not at all!  The citrus dressing was a pleasant departure from the traditional Caesar dressing.  Recommended."
,,,,,"Clam linguine: again, generously topped off with ALOT of clams, the herbal butter sauce on the linguine was superb.  Recommended."
,,,,,"Ragu bolenesse:  meat sauce was good, but after having tasted the first 2 dishes, my expectations had been exceeded so this dish was simply OK.  "
,,,,,"If your in the mood for Italian, must eat here."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Pros: Romantic ambience and cute decor!!! They have tables on the patio as well which happens to get occupied quickly during summers for obvious reasons! Great spot for a date night or for a milestone celebrations!
,,,,,Cons: Very limited vegetarian option
,,,,,We ordered the vegetarian lasagna for entree as that was the only vegetarian dish on the menu!! We loved it though and placed a same order the second time!
,,,,,"This place was phenomenal!  Came here for my 40th birthday and we were lucky enough to get a table. Beautiful restaurant. The Braised Shortribs and Spinach lasagna were some of the best food that we had the pleasure of eating while in Seattle. The quality of the food was matched by the awesome staff. Our hostess, Belle, greeted us with enthusiasm and professionalism. Our server, Shawn, took perfect care of us. She was efficient, personable, and fun! The bartenders, josh and Mikey, made beautiful drinks with practically no wait. It was a phenomenal experience!  The food was great but the staff really made the experience fantastic."
,,,,,One of my favorite Seattle restaurants!  There is nothing like summertime in Seattle with a seat on their patio.  The food is fantastic.  I feel like I'm on holiday.  Love everything about The Pink Door and often go for my birthday in August each year.  Although it's challenging to get a table you won't be disappointed.
,,,,,This is a terrible place. Don't go. We called and they said we could come and then they said they were full and turn us away. Nasty
,,,,,Excellent service from Terrence last night. Very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. We had the cioppino and the halibut special. The charcuterie appetizer was delicious too. Ambiance a big plus.
,,,,,"Overall it was a good experience aside from the service. The room was so beautiful and the view of the water was so incredible!!!! I loved the way the room was decorated. Cocktails were a little too strong for me, but was still good. I had the ravioli, and really enjoyed it. One of my friends had the lasagna And my other friend had clams/mussels- they both enjoyed their dishes. We were a party of 3... but our server added on a 20% auto gratuity even though the receipt said it was supposed to only be for parties of 6 or more. We thought that was odd but also didn't feel our server deserved more.  She was ""okay"" at best. We were celebrating my birthday, and it was also my Bachelorette weekend and in town from Texas but the waitress didn't seem to care at all. In fact, when she saw we didn't leave an additional gratuity aside from the 20% auto gratuity she came to our table and rudely asked us if the service was satisfactory. It was so awkward. The waitress kind of left a bad taste in our mouth but the restaurant is so cute and hidden!!!!"
,,,,,Loved our brunch here. The atmosphere was perfect.... I fell in love immediately. And the food was very good. Best cup of coffee I have had in awhile.
,,,,,"My sister and I were visiting for the weekend, we came here on Saturday night. It was really easy to get a reservation. Our waitress was amazing she was really helpful, super kind and had a good sense of humor. The ambiance was beautiful loved the mirrors and the entire set up! We had a really great time!"
,,,,,"We had just arrived in Seattle when COVID-19 had just started to circulate so the number of people roaming around had already started to dwindle. Luckily at this time, many restaurants were still open so we got to try a few places before the stay at home orders. Despite the changes, the Pink Door remained very busy. The bar was full, the tables were reserved. Luckily we weren't in a hurry so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar and waited about 30 min before we got our table."
,,,,,"As they state on their website, the Pink Door is built around the Italian ideals of simple, fresh and seasonal. Naturally, seafood has a prominent place on the menu. We started off with a few oysters to share (definitely worth it) and then into the entrees. Pastas were fantastic but I had my eye on the white salmon they had as a special for the evening. The waiter suggested it as a must try and, well, who was I to disagree? It was indeed a fantastic dish one that I would mind having again and again!"
,,,,,"I imagine that during the day, the view would be pretty amazing but it was dark outside by the time we got there so we enjoyed our group's company. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert because I would have loved to give it a try! When you get dropped off here, you'll have to walk around to find it. They are in a small alleyway and there's nothing but a pink door (ha!) to indicate that you have arrived at the right location. This is a must try in Seattle. Don't miss out!"
,,,,,"Amazing Place.  Brought my wife here for her Birthday, she has been telling everyone how amazing it was. Very happy that my coworker recommended it. 10/10."
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Though located in a major tourist area (Post Alley), this restaurant has a subtle entrance and is missed by undiscerning tourists ... which is great ... you get foodies, locals from the Seattle area, and the occasional person who's found it on Yelp.  In short, a good restaurant in the heart of Pike Place Market, with a pleasant clientele."
,,,,,"And the atmosphere is wonderful -- a shaded outdoor seating area is the perfect summer refuge from both the sun and the noise of the surrounding area ... the Pink Door has an island of tranquility in a sea of chaos. Or, sit indoors if the weather is inclement ... fairly standard restaurant decors inside."
,,,,,"The food is very good - Italian and seafood being the specialties. The linguine with clams (Linguine vongole) was fabulous, the Caesar salad with Dungeness crab was very good. The pasta special (spaghetti piscatore) was ok, but not as good as the other dishes (clams, mussels, shrimp over black pasta) - it was supposed to be spicy, but it lacked the bite one normally associates with puttanesca, and the tomato sauce did little to bring out the seafood flavors."
,,,,,But the linguine vongole was fabulous - try that and you won't be disappointed.
,,,,,"The food was so delicious I have to write this. Mamas meatballs Lasagna Coffee Pie Desert .  Ashley,(Pink Door hostess), thanks for the awesome energy you maintained during my visit and for the recommendations all 5 dishes were an excellent choice. I will definitely be back."
,,,,,"Other than the difficulty of getting a table, this should be among the top Italian restaurants in Seattle: foods, desserts, services, ambience, location, etc.  combined. "
,,,,,"Last time I reviewed this place was 2016!  It was a popular place then, but I got a table on Saturday with only 20 minutes wait.  We reserved a lunch table and found two long queues when we arrived.  The longer one was those who did not reserve.  Wow!"
,,,,,"Sat at the patio and felt the Italian spirit coming to live.  A very Seattle mural dominated the view.  The waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and told us behind the squid ink pasta.  Quite nice.  (Not on the menu, just ask.)"
,,,,,We got the Salmon gnocchi and bianca pizza.  Both were thoroughly enjoyable.  The gelato dessert was excellent too.  I remembered why I liked it then.
,,,,,"After the meal, we lingered a while to appreciate the decor and pointed out the changes from the re-modeling.  I recommend this tour."
,,,,,"Saturday night, prowling Pike Market for a decent restaurant, walked into the Pink Door and the wait was only 20 minutes.  That's easily handled by a drink at the bar.  That's the first good impression: a bottle of Woodinville Rye Whiskey.  Hmm... Not superbly good, yet quite tasty."
,,,,,"We order oysters, then share the main dishes: black seafood pasta, risotto, and mussel and clams. The seafood pasta also used mussels and claims, I hope the waitress, a friendly and helpful one, would have told us."
,,,,,"Desserts were really nice.  The ""deconstructed Rhubarb"" was the most impressive one.  Cheese cake had no crust and that's daring.  Lemon Mereign was not my thing, the plating and construction were very good looking."
,,,,,"Overall, a warm and high quality Italian restaurant tucked in Pike Place with a very nice patio for summer days."
,,,,,Bit pricy.
,,,,,"The cutest restaurant. Absolutely so dainty. The property is surprisingly huge. And there are incredible views from some seats too. I loved the pasta dishes, each were cooked as a true al dente."
,,,,,It's a beautiful restaurant serving good Italian food. I was under the impression that this is a must-try Italian restaurant in Seattle. I'm satisfied with our experiences. 
,,,,,"The decor and design were definitely the highlights of Pink Door. The decor was quirky and bright. When we reserved on Open Door, I requested outdoor seating and the weather was beautiful to sit on the patio. On the Patio you can oversee the sea and pier. "
,,,,,"Under our waitress' recommendations, we got the cold appetizer consisting of olives, vegetables, cheese, and meat. We also got the special Black Squid and Linguine. Both dishes were very good! "
,,,,,"Overall I think this is a great restaurant to check out, if you have free time or extra dollars, but not a 5-star worthy must-try establishment."
,,,,,Definitely worth the hype and lives up to being well known in Seattle. Highly recommend reservations for especially during these times. Service was great and caring of social distance. Food was came out very quickly and everything was up to par. The rigatoni and meatballs as seen in the photo were very flavorful and well seasoned.
,,,,,"This place is FANTASTIC! I ordered the ahi tuna crudo and the Penn cove clams and mussels. Next time I need two orders of each! The ahi crudo melts in your mouth and the clams and mussels broth is drink-a-ble! UGH! I'll ask for extra broth next time, don't care, this fatty wants that broth!"
,,,,,This place was seriously the highlight of my Seattle trip because it was that good! Every dish that I tried was beyond expectations! 
,,,,,"If you are in the area or planning to visit, this is a must try place to go! It was worth the 45 minute wait for me. I would recommend you making reservations ahead of time to avoid the wait! "
,,,,,I highly recommend getting the Lasagna Pink Door and the Arancini for appetizers!
,,,,,"I absolutely love the Pink Door! It's my go to place for a special occasion because it hits the mark on ambiance, food, and service. Plus, they always have some sort of live performance going on - burlesque performances, aerial, or jazz etc depending on the night."
,,,,,Their scallops are like butter and seriously the best I have had. It's a shame that each order comes with only three because I could legit each 10 scallops no problem ;) You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu though! I'm never ordered something that was even mediocre.
,,,,,"Definitely get a drink here, they do them right. And definitely I would recommend a rsvp at least a week or two out, particularly if you want to hit one of the nights where they have a performance. They do release more rsvps for same day, at 10am the day of though."
,,,,,"After hopping off the Alaskan cruise, my sister and I took our parents around Seattle. Luckily, I made a reservation on Open Table weeks in advance for a 3pm reservation. We managed to get seated right when it opened since we were hungry and did not want to wait lol."
,,,,,"My family did family-style to try multiple highly recommended dishes provided by our waiter, Mario B. We got the Pizza Bianca, Lasagna, Summer Risotto, Linguine Alle Vongole, and Gelato Trio. "
,,,,,"The individual pizza was a chef's creation of the day, which consisted of salami, artichoke, and arugula. It's not something I would typically order, but I was so happy that I did. Pizza was absolutely cheesy and full of flavor with only a few ingredients. Lasagna was layered with spinach pasta and pesto covered in marinara. It was so savory and definitely one of the best lasagnas I've ever eaten. Clam linguine cooked with garlic and white wine was quite average for me, but I was glad all the clams were thoroughly cleaned and not full of sand. Summer risotto was the family favorite. I wish it had more dungeness crab, but it was so delicious that everyone kept getting seconds after the first bite. The honey lavender gelato was also another favorite. I thought it tasted better than Salt and Straw in LA because the lavender flavor was not overpowering the taste buds."
,,,,,"Overall, the Pink Door made our day with incredible food leaving us feeling extremely satisfied. This place is a MUST if visiting Seattle and highly recommend ordering wine to go with the food!!"
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,A true Seattle favorite. 
,,,,,This place existed long before technology nerds and awkward autistic dudes tried to pick up girls. 
,,,,,Places like this supersede all of the drama in Seattle. Support them and you support the important things.
,,,,,"an outstanding place with awesome italian food and a great view. the lasagna was top notch and delicious, the meatball sandwich was on point and very filling. the prices are fair and the food is some of the best around the pike area, do not miss out and go somewhere else if looking for some great italian food. the service was great, will be back when in the area."
,,,,,One word comes to mind when thinking of my experience at The Pink Door Restaurant... underwhelming.
,,,,,"My friend and I have come to Seattle on vacation several times in the past, and we've always wanted to try The Pink Door because of it's raving online reviews. We made our reservation a month in advance and we're looking forward to what should have been a truly unique & amusing experience. Well, maybe I shouldn't have set my expectations so high."
,,,,,"Firstly, I want to say that the staff was great. I have no complaints whatsoever about our waiter or any of the employees we encountered during our visit. They were all very welcoming, professional, & interesting."
,,,,,"The atmosphere: As soon as you pass through the pink door, you can tell this place is different. The internet describes it as, ""part circus burlesque, part Italian restaurant...with an ambiance that is both funky & hip."" --I would have to agree with this. The decorations, music & layout all suggests a mysterious, old-world, carnival theme with a fine dining upgrade thrust into the mix. Really it made me think of gypies disguised in tuxedos & white linens. Very unique."
,,,,,"However, throughout our two-hour stay, not once did we encounter any trapeze artists, circus performers, or live music--which was one of main reasons we wanted to come here in the first place. We thought it would be fun to have dinner and a show. The closest we got to seeing a trapeze artist was the one painted on the kitchen door on the way to the bathroom. After reading some of the online reviews, it's clear this type of (advertised) amusement is very rare & sporadic...and that I am not the only person to be disappointed by the lack of entertainment at The Pink Door."
,,,,,"The Food: As expensive as it was, you'd think it would've tasted better. For our appetizer, we shared the Arancini, which is sort of a fried rice ball stuffed with cheese & served over marinara sauce. --This was very good, I would order it again. Then I had the Crusty Bread Stuffed with Mama's Meatballs...""crusty"" bread? More like soggy bread with very little flavor. The meatballs were good, however a little dry. My friend had the Spring Risotto & she said she liked it. For dessert we shared the Rose Panna Cotta which was quite different from anything I'd had before. You could really taste the hibiscus in the sauce. It was very sweet & bitter at the same time. I was disappointed in my Italian Cream Soda. It was very watered down & had no ""kick"" at all like Italian sodas should. So basically, the food overall was nothing to write home about--unless you're writing home to ask for more money because you spent all your cash on this over-rated, presumptuous meal."
,,,,,"Another thing that was very annoying is how LONG we had to wait for everything!  Don't get me wrong, I like a nice, leisurely meal with plenty of time to chat and enjoy my food. But there's a limit to how long you should have to wait between courses. We had to wait for our waiter to take our drink order and then wait for him to take our food order and then wait for each thing to come out and wait for the bill to arrive...and I'm not talking about 5 minutes here. There was at LEAST a 15-minute gap of waiting between the moment we finished one thing & when another thing would arrive...and I'm a very slow eater. A good waiter keeps an eye on his guests & paces them so he can bring the next course out within a few minutes of when you've finished the last."
,,,,,"And by the way, those ""astonishing views from the terrace overlooking Elliot Bay"" --if you can ignore looking down at the filthy back allies of Pike's Place Market & can look beyond the ugly rooftops of the buildings right in front of you then yeah, you might see something ""astonishing"" in the distance. --Yet another under-whelming aspect of this place."
,,,,,"Overall, I was disappointed & underwhelmed by my experience at The Pink Door Restaurant & felt like it wasn't worth my time or money. Even though I did find some positive things to say about this place, I probably won't come here again or recommend it to my family and friends."
,,,,,"This place is amazing!!! Looks are not very good from the outside, but once you step foot in there it blows your mind. From the decor on the walls to the outside view. This place is amazing. The wait staff are excellent. The drinks are very well made. The food on the other hand...is off this world. I had the braised beef and my wife had the risotto and I would definitely recommend both. The braised beef was mind melting and the risotto was sooooo refreshing. This place deserves more than 5 stars!!!"
,,,,,"Hands down the best restaurant we ate at in Seattle. Make sure you make a reservation! We ordered the crudo, white fish, linguini, aioli fries and beet salad. All delicious!"
,,,,,I highly recommend this hidden gem!
,,,,,"We lived in Magnolia for almost 2 years and only during the last few months did we try this place.  That makes me sad since the food here is amazing.  Can be a little too salty at times, but it's restaurant food.  Outside patio was amazing on the hot summer days and the drinks were well made and strong. Customer service was on par as I believe the owner came by to make sure everything was in order, just to check on us.  Interior is beautiful with the pink salt bar, I would say great place to take a date or have a girls night dinner out."
,,,,,Restaurant is overrated and the food was underwhelming. I suppose it's considered good Italian food if you've never been to Italy.
,,,,,Decent and light food. Meatball is fresh and pasta is soft. Seafood plate is good as well. It's not as unique as I was hoping for. So 4 stats instead of 5.
,,,,,Wow- thanks to a foodie friend we stumbled into this place. Another sweet talking friend got us on the wait list. This is not to be missed. 
,,,,,We had plenty of bread and infused olive oil. Delicious!  
,,,,,"I ordered the Seared Sea Scallops, not to be disappointed. Tender, succulent and Devine. Not a lot of flare with this dish but wonderful. Others had the Lasagna Pink Door, Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese and Lavander Glazed Lamb Porterhouse. Everything was sooooo good. "
,,,,,I so want to come back for the trapeze show another day...
,,,,,"A pink door stands before you, on the outside it seems like a private property that raise no interests. A"
,,,,,"step through the door brings you downstairs into a beauitful dining room with a small stage for live entertainment. We were sat in the back and gosh was this restaurant beautiful. The Bologese was so good! The sauce was spectacular, the pasta was al dente and fresh. I also got the tuna special appetizer, the fish was done medium rare accompanied by a lemony hollandaise. The fish was so good, the crust had enough flavor to carry throughout the whole fish. I'm bringing my next lover here 5/5."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Casual and tasty restaurant for Italian foods next to Pike's Market area.  Understated pink door that we almost missed when walking down Post Alley.
,,,,,The restaurant is very popular and I highly recommend making reservations.  We were in Seattle for an Alaskan cruise and I was able to get a 2:30 pm reservation for a late lunch on disembark day.
,,,,,"For starters, we had their salumi platter and octopus, shrimp, and celery salad."
,,,,,"For entrees, we had their cioppino and mussels and clams dish."
,,,,,We ordered a chardonnay and amarone for wines.  
,,,,,Desserts also very good and not sugary.
,,,,,Service was friendly. I would recommend this restaurant.
,,,,,The service was good. But the food (pappardelle bolognese and spring risotto) was just okay. Nice enough view. ‍
,,,,,"The food and aesthetics of the restaurant are amazing! I ordered the bolognese and it was small, but delicious. I can't wait to come back and watch a trapeze performance someday if I can score a reservation. Highly recommend if you've never been, and this would be a great place if you have family visiting from out-of-state since it's near all the touristy areas."
,,,,,"Lovely lunch spot with a great view from the back dinning room! The Everything Green Salad was a delightful palette refresher. We had it along side an Antipasto. We selected two pasta dishes. Both had fresh ingredients. I ordered a pea ravioli and I was not disappointed, but I liked my sister's bolognese better. The overdone gilded French decor was charming. We especially liked the monkey painting and vintage playing cards. We would go back again for lunch. The cocktails were whimsical with edible flowers and the house mocktail made a splash! We ordered cocktails, two appetizers, and two entrees and split the bill with each of us paying around $60.00 with tip."
,,,,,"Welp, that's my birthday dinner. Thank god I got to go before everything close down again. I always wanted to go and many of my friends recommended here and kinda judged me for never been there but calling myself a foodie. We made reservations, better do it! And we got a good view, and I ordered 2 Prosecco or 3? I don't remember but it tasted amazing and the glass made me feel bougie. I ordered a mushroom risotto and it tasted amazing! And I wanted more. I took a bite from all my friends meal, all of them are worth to try it. Definitely a fun place for date, birthday or celebration"
,,,,,All I heard didn't live to even average expectations. The people were quite friendly and wonderful.  The food tonight was ok. 
,,,,,We started with bruschetta with the bread over toasted. The tomatoes tasted ok and the plate didn't have enough olive oil. 
,,,,,The pasta was average at best. 
,,,,,Overall service amazing and food average. 
,,,,,Enjoy
,,,,,"This place is such a gem! If you want cute ambiance, delicious Italian food, great service, and sometimes awesome entertainment in Seattle, I highly recommend coming to the Pink Door! Totally worth the thousands-of-great-reviews hype."
,,,,,"I visited Seattle for the weekend and came here with one of my friends. Unfortunately, we didn't attend during a night when the instrumentalists or dancers were there, but I'm sure it's extra amazing! If you want to eat at Pink Door, I highly recommend booking a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance, or else take your chances trying to walk in. Luckily, I read this beforehand and snagged a 9pm reservation on a Friday night and it was perfect. "
,,,,,What we ate:
,,,,,"Seared scallops: Absolutely delish. We could not eat this dish fast enough. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. If you love scallops, this dish will not disappoint."
,,,,,"Linguine Alle Vongole: this one was my dish and SO tasty. It has clams, pancetta, and linguine cooked in a white wine butter sauce. It also tastes a bit lemony, so if you love the lemon-garlic flavor, this dish is for you. "
,,,,,Lemon Verbena Shortcake: oh my gosh! So good! The berry jam on this makes the WHOLE dish. 
,,,,,Mascarpone Lemon Pistachio Cheesecake: my favorite dessert in a very long time. I am a huge fan of lemon in dessert and it was balanced perfectly by the pistachio flavor and creaminess of the cheesecake. I highly recommend trying this dessert. So unique and delicious.
,,,,,A Full Carafe of Red Wine: duh. 
,,,,,I am absolutely looking forward to coming back here whenever I visit Seattle. Remember to make a reservation and look for the light pink door down Post Alley!
,,,,,"View is 5 stars but not the food. I ordered seafood blow, fish was try and had to order pasta separately. Their meatball and lasagna is okay."
,,,,,"The Pink Door is hidden down an alley with no signage but, surprise, their pink door! There happened to be a last minute reservation open up for lunch, so my husband and I snagged it and ran over. We were able to sit outside on an absolutely beautiful sunny day, and enjoy the fresh air! "
,,,,,"We started with drinks, and my watermelon margarita was delicious! I would definitely order that again. The bread service, and especially the accompanying oil, was perfect just as I was starting to get hangry. Pizza of the Day was fig, prosciutto, grilled onions and arugula (my absolute fave!!!), so naturally I ordered that, while my husband got the summer risotto, complete with crab on top!"
,,,,,"We definitely enjoyed our time here, and the bill was reasonable given quality of fresh ingredients and location."
,,,,,"Hubs and I were starving after a long day of walking around and decided we needed hearty meaty food. This beautiful restaurant is nestled in an alley close to the Pike Place Market. We didn't make a reservation but we walked in and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Not a problem, we just went across the way to get a drink at The Tasting Room. Within 20 minutes we got a text that a table is ready. Mind the steps going into the restaurant, they are steep. We were served water right away. Our waitress was so kind and helpful with suggestions, answering our questions. Husband ordered a whiskey drink, some sort of boulevardier. I ordered iced tea, it was very good. We shared the grilled bread, figs, arugula and prosciutto with goat cheese, rigatoni and meatballs, and the pappardelle with ragu bolognese. OH MY GOD. Everything, EVERYTHING was fresh and delicious, and best of all, perfectly proportioned for two to share. The figs, goat cheese, balsamic, and prosciutto melted in our mouths. We used the bread to sop up the remaining cheese on the plate. Those pappardelle noodles were delicate and tender. The rigatoni and meatballs were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Pasta is definitely the star of the show, neither dish were drowning in sauce. Obviously the chefs and owners care deeply about this place. It was packed. Do yourself a favor and PLEASE go to this restaurant. If we'd made a reservation we could've sat outdoors on the patio overlooking the water. Inside was lovely too. We were treated to a jazz trio performance!"

,,,,,"The Pink Door is one of the most highly recommended restaurants in Seattle and I couldn't wait to try it!  The entrance on Post Alley is a quaint, literal pink door - without a sign, so its easy to miss your first time.  The restaurant is much larger than the door would allude to, and the dining room is brightly lit with a great view.  There's also an outdoor patio, but it was closed on this chilly day.

,,,,,"Our server was hilarious and prompt.  I asked his advice on the seasonal butternut squash risotto versus the pappardelle bolognese.  He casually mentioned that the bolognese has been on the menu for 36 years. Instantly sold, and did not regret it.  It was incredible.  Our table also shared ""mama's meatballs"" -  I could eat those everyday.  For entrees, my friend's had the lasagna and the seafood pasta special which included clams, mussels, prawns and scallops.  The dessert menu was tempting but we were all too full - another reason to return!"
,,,,,"Absolutely wonderful! Great food, great service, great ambiance. Seafood Pescadore and Bolognese pasta, tiramisu. Can not wait to come back to this lovely place!"
,,,,,"LOVED THIS PLACE! the food was great, service was great, the aerial show was fun! Perfect date night dinner!"
,,,,,Enjoyed a lovely late lunch early dinner here last month when visiting Seattle.
,,,,,"Make reservations people! I waited until a week before to do so and had to take what they had left, which wasn't very many options, but it worked out. If you are planning a special occasion, make sure to reserve a table at least 6 weeks out."
,,,,,"The outside of the restaurant is a simple pink door (hence the name), and when you walk in, it's surprising very spacious with lovely decor."
,,,,,"We were seated promptly and started with some drinks. I ordered a raspberry lemon drop, sooo good. One of the girls had the watermelon mock tail and I forgot the other drink. The drinks were good and they were pretty stiff too."
,,,,,"For dinner, we had the Salmon, Lasagna, rigatoni and for appetizers the mama meatballs and caprese salads. "
,,,,,"Everything we had was delicious. The prices for the meatballs and the caprese salads were a bit much though considering it's a side salad that consist of 3 things and they were like 3 meatballs. Quality was there though. For dessert we had the pistachio cheesecake. It was okay, but I would probably try another dessert if we were to visit again."
,,,,,We enjoyed our meal near the window with a nice view on a great day.
,,,,,Thanks Pink Door for a great experience!
,,,,,"Vongole paste was good, but the tomato based entree was below my expectation. Food came out very fast, which i loved. Restaurant is super pretty definitely worth a visit!"
,,,,,Great lounge and outdoor seating. Food is quintessentially farm to table with fresh local sound seafood!  Wonderful vibe and burlesque shows when available!  Love it!
,,,,,"This place is a Seattle institution, I await for the day the city makes this place a landmark. Their modern, with respect to the past, approach to Italian cooking is filled with passion and flavor. There's not a bad thing on the menu! The lasagna is a must. Oh and the scallops, best I've ever had. The staff are all very well-versed, energetic, and friendly. I also love that the Pink Door offers gluten-free alternatives for my gluten intolerant guests. "
,,,,,"The Pink Door is an experience with an amazing, colorful and flavorful  atmosphere. I will recommend this place time and time again. "
,,,,,"P.S: make a reservation, always."
,,,,,One of my all time favorite places to eat in Seattle! Atmosphere is unreal. Food is amazing must try their lasagna!! I always order lasagna. My boyfriend ordered it and love it as well!
,,,,,I'm more than stoked that we ate here on Valentine's Day for dinner.
,,,,,The food was unbelievable and that was after I trekked it back 1/2 mile in the snow.
,,,,,The ambiance at this place is really great and it has a good view of the waterfront. My husband and I wanted to come here because we heard that it's a must-try kind of spot and on our 2nd visit to Seattle we are able to go. The food was mediocre. The meatballs were subpar and the risotto was really watery. Our favorite item ended up being the bread with the olive oil.

,,,,,"Vaxx me at the door, baby! Anywhere that's requiring vaccines is getting four stars, it could be a popsicle stand with ants crawling all over it. But, this would get like six big goddamn stars for awesomeness on top of the safety measures. The most primo clam linguine I've ever had and a good vibe with the music. There is a Pink Door in Seattle, there is a Green Door in Cheyenne, and they are both modern marvels for their respective reasons."
,,,,,Went to pink door with my friends. Made the reservation a few weeks out because we wanted to be able to sit on the outside patio during sunset . Food was excellent as always

,,,,,The rave reviews know what's up! The Pink Door is a must eat at restaurant near Pike Place Market. The outdoor seating is beautiful and we had such a lovely waitress who really took care of us during our delicious meal. Only word I can think of to describe the caprese is 'delightful'! I had the lasagna which came out burning hot so I had to be careful to not burn my mouth. Otherwise the lasagna was fantastic. Wish we could have seen the trapeze performance but there's always next time!
,,,,,"Hours of operation were not accurate on yelp.  Made reservation online. Called restaurant and was told they were not open during the date & time I made my reservation.  The person answering the phone was rude.  We were looking for a special place to have dinner during our trip to Seattle. The day before my reservation date, I received a text message wanting me to confirm my reservation and I responded by canceling it as I was told the restaurant was not open that day and I made reservation elsewhere.  On the day of my reservation, I received a phone call from the restaurant wanting me to confirm my reservation, I informed the caller that I was told the restaurant was not going to be open, so I cancelled my reservation and made other plans. The person in the phone was rude and told me their hours changed.  Not friendly customer service.  We enjoyed dinner at That's Amore instead which was superb, the best customer service, and family owned!"
,,,,,"Great ambience, friendly service and great food. Best restaurant experience we've had in a very long time! Caesar salad, Pink Door Lasagna, broccolini side dish and Peanut butter brownie dessert were amazing!"
,,,,,"It's truly heartbreaking that COVID has hit because I had an annual date at the Pink Door, which I looked forward to every time I flew back to Seattle."
,,,,,Where do I begin? Their risotto is amazing. The portions are big enough to fill you up but small enough to leave room for dessert. I love that you can get a three-course meal for just $30! 
,,,,,"I can't wait to come back to the Pink Door for the live music and trapeze artist performances but until then, I'll be faithfully ordering take-out of my beloved mushroom risotto."
,,,,,First time visiting Seattle and our friends told us we had to stop here! We made reservations about a week in advance and could only get in at 9:30. Highly recommended making it way sooner. The restaurant is decorated beautifully. My husband and I got a table facing the water and it was lovely. The waiter told us the lasagna recipe had not been changed since the 80s so we had to try. It was 10/10 and you don't even miss the meat. Must try!
,,,,,"Love this restaurant, little bit pricey, but never disappoints. "
,,,,,You definitely need to reserve  table if you want to sit in the main dining. My advice will be a week before to be on the safer side.
,,,,,"Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view."
,,,,,Food is always good. They have one of the  best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.
,,,,,Only sad  thing is they don't have lot of optIons for the people who are allergic to red meat and shrimp. So that was a bummer for my wife. 
,,,,,But still would like to  go back again.
,,,,,"This place is a staple of Seattle...sometimes hard to find, but just look for the pale pink door and window sills. Service is impeccable and the food is to die for! Lots of pasta dishes and delicious/unique dishes to choose from. The inside of the restaurant is so delightful as well!"
,,,,,"Yum Yum Yum! I got the spaghetti with clams, which is one of my favorite italian meals ever, and it did not disappoint. I loved the atmosphere here and the drinks were great! It was hard getting a table due to covid restrictions and we had to go in and get on a waitlist. Luckily we were at a hotel very close so it was easy to get there within 10 minutes when they texted us. I also got the oysters which were special that day because they were giant. It came with this balsamic ice sauce, which i didn't really like."

,,,,,"Like many other people I had heard about The Pink Door for years but for some mysterious reason never visited. This changed when my husband and I made a reservation to celebrate our 30th anniversary a few weeks ago. Everything - and I mean everything - was outstanding. The ambiance is charming: shabby chic with all kinds of funky/interesting bits of decor to look at. We were seated right next to the window overlooking the Sound: a beautiful view inside and out. Our waiter made a few recommendations, some of which we took. We ordered a roasted endive and a caesar salad (both fantastic) a side of brussels sprouts (amazing) and for our mains the 16-oz ribeye and the cioppino. For dessert we had the pumpkin blondie, swimming in a perfect caramel sauce. (I say 'we' but I ate every bite of it myself, since my husband in doing Keto - which he was able to successfully and deliciously do with the other things he'd ordered.) While this is not an inexpensive place to eat, the value was fantastic: the food, the service, the ambiance, the experience is one we will be sure to repeat when we have our next milestone to celebrate."
,,,,,It's no wonder this place has thousands of reviews and nearly 5 stars. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing. 
,,,,,"We arrived on a Thursday to find this hidden gem, and there was over an hour wait for a table around 830pm. We were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar which was perfection. All the while there was live music playing and I really felt like I was in Italy. "
,,,,,"To start I had the fennel salad, bread, and a cheese board. Loved how the cheese board was paired with a different sauce or topping for each cheese. The salad was also delicious."
,,,,,"For dinner i the lasagna which is not traditional lasagna, I believe it has some pesto in there. It was delicious and not too heavy. Finally got dessert we had the pumpkin bread pudding. Wow was this amazing. Must get!"
,,,,,My husband and I tracked all the wya from Texas to celebrate our 1 year anniversary to hear jazz and supposedly see burlesque and eat Italian food. We had to make reservations weeks in advance! Disappointed when we got to the host stand and she told us our reservation was not found: I showed all proof of confirmation and even asked to speak to the manager. Who was a total racist jerk! The second the host requested we speak to him he came walking up to us and said no reservations get out would not even let us explain or show him how we are confirmed and set. I cried of sadness and my husband felt so racial profiled. Yes we're Mexicans and speak English but for him to speak to us in such a loud tone and use hand motions as if we were not comprehending. We were humiliated by the manager and host in front of  all the guest . We flew in so far to just be turned away and shut off so quickly.  
,,,,,It was raining so hard and we had to wait outside to even wait for a manager or even be given a second of their time
,,,,,"Made a reservation for a Sunday night during Memorial Day weekend a month prior. This place didn't disappoint food wise. My friend and I ordered bolognese, lasagna, side of asparagus and a special temp dish of gnocchi. Everything was great and tasty. I'm still thinking about that lasagna. Yummy!"
,,,,,If I was asked to describe The Pink Door in one word I'd say mesmerizing!
,,,,,"This place is not what you'd expect it to be as you walk past their entrance on Post Alley, which by the way is an actual pink door. Once you open that door and step inside, It will feel like you opened the doors to your wardrobe and stepped into Narnia. A different world. "
,,,,,"The very beautiful space makes the experience that much better. My boyfriend surprised me by bringing me here our last night in Seattle and we loved it. Loved the decor, the aerial silk performance, the superb service, and of course, the food!"
,,,,,"Small quantities (at least what we ordered), but very satisfying. We started off with the salumi platter and some drinks. Followed with some pasta which was delicious and definitely left me wanting to order some more!"
,,,,,"I would definitely recommend stopping by here! But of course, don't forget to make a reservation! Happy eating :p"
,,,,,Make a reservation to have a perfect evening at The Pink Door. So happy that our friends from Texas recommended this delicious restaurant. 
,,,,,"Located off a side alley behind a ""Pink Door"" only marked with a floral arch, you would walk by this restaurant if you didn't know where you were headed. It was completely booked the night we came, so call ahead to guarantee a table. "
,,,,,"The experience is both a gustatory, visual and audio delight. The interior is stunning and the spaces from the entry to the bar to the tables overlooking the water each displayed a unique atmosphere. Loved the waterfront view from the room where we celebrated a birthday dinner. "
,,,,,"So many choices from homemade pastas to frutti di mare to carne. The Lasagna Pink Door is a great dish which layers fresh spinach pasta, besciamella, and pesto topped with marinara sauce. The lavender glazed lamb porterhouse was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Loved the artichoke sformato that accompanied the lamb. Such a delicious, light bite of this savory Italian custard-like contorni. The fish of the day, a wild caught Coho salmon, with a side of pole beans and mushrooms was also excellent. Thanks to Jackie Lu for the great service. "
,,,,,"Both the menus and the entertainment change seasonally or nightly. As the menu is based on locally sourced produce, available ingredients flavor  what may be offered. Entertainment ranges from jazz musicians to aerialists to even a Tarot reading. "
,,,,,"When in Seattle, make a reservation. You won't be disappointed."
,,,,,"For many newcomers, finding The Pink Door is like finding Nemo... it'll take a bit of scavenger hunt around the neighborhood blocks before coming across the restaurant entrance. Although the Pink Door pops with a contrast from the exterior gray wall, one can still easily miss it on plain sight as it's tucked along the back alley of busy Pike Place. It's sign-less, it's subtle... it's actually a pleasant surprise! The impressions one holds with regard to the nameless pink door immediately vanish as soon as you enter the restaurant. The interior is not only cozy and semi-rustic, but also gives off a charming-vintage vibe. A vibe that complements well with extensive selection of freshly prepared and flavorful Italian fine dishes and variety of spirits."
,,,,,"During these uncertain times with Covid, The Pink Door has revamped their focus on 'To-Go-Go' service that can be ready for pickup in 20 minutes as well as thorough safety measures in-placed for 'Dine In' reservations."
,,,,,"Came on a Saturday night and did a walk-in reservation for 2 hours later. That's fine, we went to explore Pike Place in the meantime. We managed to snag a table outside. The patio was so cute and charming and had a lovely view of the water. Our waiter was attentive and gave great recommendations. I ordered the Bitter Winds of Change cocktail and the Linguine Alle Vongole. I was delighted at how generous they were with the clams. My pasta was cooked perfectly and not overdrenched in sauce. Very pleased. Oh, and bread was free of course! I think this would make a really cute datenight spot or somewhere nice to treat your parents."
,,,,,"Presentation: 5/5 Amazing plating. Everything looked perfect, didn't even want to eat it."
,,,,,Flavor: 4/5 The Tuscan Fries & Fried Herbs were delicious and perfectly crispy on the outside until the last bite. They were saltier than the main dishes we ordered. 
,,,,,My partner liked the Pappardelle Al Ragù Bolognese the most. She rated it a 5/5. She also mentioned the white wine sauce from the Linguine Alle Vongole was amazing. 
,,,,,"I too preferred the flavor from the Bolognese. The Linguini was more on lighter side, not salty whatsoever. They were pretty heavy handed with the clams which is perfect for a seafood lover like me. The food was great, but not mind-blowing. Definitely would come back for the fries and other menu items."
,,,,,Cleanliness: 5/5 All the staff and patrons were wearing masks (outside of eating). When waiters/waitresses were near it was asked that the patrons wear their masks when ordering.
,,,,,"Price Effectiveness: 4/5 More on the pricier side, but still affordable with everything tallying up to about $70."
,,,,,"Parking: Recommend to park at Pike Place Market Parking, costed about $8 for 2-3 hours."
,,,,,"if you're looking for a cute lunch or dinner date with water views, add this to your list! this is conveniently located at pike place market, so if you're in the mood for dessert or a second meal it's waking distance from several places. "
,,,,,"the ambience and cute interior decor won me over. the presentation of their food is great, and the dishes were flavorful. "
,,,,,we ordered the linguine alle volgone and cioppino pink door. the  linguine seems to be a popular dish on the menu. they were generous with the amount of clams and pasta leaving us feeling very satisfied. the cioppino is a great choice for those who want to try a variety of seafood. their tomato and white wine broth is excellent and is perfect for dipping that bread 
,,,,,"highly recommend making reservations ahead of time. this place seems to be a popular one, so don't be like us ( thinking we could walk in at 8pm for a nice dinner without reservations )"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This Italian restaurant was recommended to me as a must go. Reservations were filled weeks out but they mentioned they take walk ins so we took a risk and only waited 30 minutes (on a week day). Food was average, service was terrible. The waitress didn't even introduce herself and tell us her name. She barley came by and when she did she barley spoke a few words. The best part about this place was the vibe. Super romantic, great date spot, they had live music which made it feel like you were in Italy. I'd go back for drinks and that's about it."
,,,,,"This place is terrible, olive garden is way better.staff are rude I am Hispanic and I felt I welcomed, they were judging me probably because the way I dressed. The food was just okay reall oily, pasta was over cooked and cold, stale bread, dirty dishes. "
,,,,,And they asked me if I had Id and I don't because I am illegal.
,,,,,"A little hidden gem in the middle of Pike Place Market area. We scored an amazing spot at the bar where Mikey took excellent care of us.  The food was exquisite, the atmosphere quaint and relaxed and the friendly, fast and professional service made our last dinner in Seattle unforgettable."
,,,,,"The food was tasty, the server was friendly, the view was impressive (we got a window table overlook puget sound and the market), and the price was very reasonable. What more to ask for?"
,,,,,So happy that we went here. Best Italian food I've ever had!! All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. Make sure that you make a reservation ahead of time.
,,,,,"We went to the pink door for lunch this afternoon and everything was wonderful! The outside seating worked out well, although if you're not a fan of sitting in the sun there's not many options. My husband and I both ordered the Black Lives Matter cocktail which was incredible (I had two). We also ordered their fries, garlic bread, calamarata, and clam linguine. The garlic bread was so good and definitely worth the extra charge! We will be coming back every time we're in the area"
,,,,,Probably closer to 4.5 stars for the great location in pike market area but cordoned off in a post alley without any identifiable signage at the entrance. The color of the door want my idea of pink but it's the only thing that comes close so I step inside to find a cozy indoor space and a really nice patio perfect for the summer months in Seattle. Service of super friendly and the food and drinks are reasonably priced and very good. Don't expect to have tour mind blown like  meal At bestia in Los Angeles or a high end Italian restaurant in Italy but it's a really nice take on home style coming with high end ingredients and some fusion dishes. The oysters were better than Taylor's or Elliot and about the same price. Cocktails were also really good.
,,,,,What a fun place with amazing decor. The portions are massive! The ambiance is beautiful especially at sunset. Love how eclectic this place was. Everything we ordered was delicious.
,,,,,"Definitely enjoyed my experience here, the food was really good- but I wouldn't rate it 5 stars. The lasagna was yummy, but a pretty small portion for the price. The seafood was definitely fresh, but not the best I've ever had. Overall, recommend but not worth 100% of the hype."
,,,,,The Pink Door Lived up to the hype.  No need to say more...but I will.  What an amazing experience.
,,,,," Looking for the pink door in an alley, Post Alley to be exact was fun.  It's not so much pink as it is salmon color :-).  Nondescript.  One alley up from the pike place market, parking is plentiful but you will have to pay for it otherwise it's very limited around there."
,,,,,"You enter down a set of stairs into the bar area, a swing hanging from the ceiling, along with Ariel silks where live performances take place during dinner.  A small stage with a piano and as you wrap around the bar area you enter into the dining room, a beautiful setting, great views of puget sound, the Ferris wheel, sunsets.  "
,,,,,The service was excellent.
,,,,,"The food was outstanding although my father did not care for his seafood ciopinno, he said it was rubbery."
,,,,,"The oysters were a hit, the salads fresh and tasty.  The linguine and clams were amazing, flavorful and a ton of clams.  The rigatoni was popular, the pork shank melted in your mouth, the gnocchi and the risotto were excellent."
,,,,,The pumpkin dessert was heavenly.
,,,,,Prices are reasonable.
,,,,,"Dress to impress if you wish but also feel find if you go casual, it's quite the mix.  "
,,,,,You Definitely need reservations.
,,,,,Enjoy the experience!
,,,,,Happy 18th to my nephew Chase!!

,,,,,We were spending the night in Seattle after a trip to Alaska. We were looking for restaurants near our hotel in downtown Seattle.  The Pink Door came up on our search & the reviews were so positive. The food was wonderful! We started with their bruschetta which was thick cut heirloom tomatoes on perfectly crisped crostini's seasoned with balsamic vinegar & other seasonings. It was absolutely spectacular. I dream of this starter. Also had their charcuterie & the meats were so fresh & beautifully presented. So very tasty. I had the clam linguine & it was loaded with clams. It was so full of clams you couldn't see the linguine. It was delicious! Two in our partyhad the cioppino & they raved about how good it was. The place had a wonder ambience & great service. Wish I lived in Seattle just to go to this restaurant!
,,,,,"We came on a Wednesday in the end of July around 2pm during Covid and were able to walk right in without a reservation.  That made us so happy.  Yes, we needed to be masked, but this was our first restaurant that asked us to mask up whenever the waiter was at our table.  That got old quick, but he tried to not bug us too much unless we called him over.  "
,,,,,"We tried the special and I'm not exactly sure what they called it but it had black spaghetti noodles and plenty of delicious seafood including shrimp, clams, calamari and octopus all drenched in the most delicious marinara sauce.    For us, the sauce was by far stealing the show, but the seafood was also cooked just right.  The noodles were good, and very different, but didn't match in flavor what we felt they could have for how unique they were.  They were very al dente, but overall we still enjoyed it.  "
,,,,,"We also got a side of La Fettunta bread and could absolutely taste the high quality of the olive oil that was used.  Be aware this bread is very crusty and not too soft, but we loved soaking up any sauce we could with it.  "
,,,,,This joint is a lovely experience all tucked away in the gem of Pikes place.
,,,,,"I love spaghetti, and I love Italian food. The pink door is a great restaurant for whether you want to go on a date, or whether you wanna try a different authentic Italian food. Come here, I didn't know what to expect, the spaghetti was good, and the meat sauce was OK. The food was really average, but my friends loved us, so they'll give a different review. In terms of me, I can see myself coming back, but I would make it a first priority. "
,,,,,"If your hungry, you love Italian food, you should try this place."
,,,,,"This is the best italian restaurant I have ever had in Seattle. Worth the trip, worth the far in advance booking, finding parking spot and walk all the way to this hidden gem!"
,,,,,"This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar "
,,,,,It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment. 
,,,,,"We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu "
,,,,,To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong 
,,,,,The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before 
,,,,,The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach 
,,,,,The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it. 
,,,,,For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off
,,,,,I had been really excited to try this place since it is an extremely famous spot however finding the entrance was a bit of a hassle since it is literally just the pink door which doesn't look like an entrance. 
,,,,,"The food was good and I liked the tuna the best but nothing exquisite (perhaps because I had such high expectations for it) Sadly, the dancers were not there but the service was good. Great place if you want to get dressed up but you also don't feel out of place if you're in more casual attire!"
,,,,,The perfect fancy takeout for our anniversary.  The food was absolutely delicious.Really good food. The service was extremely good.Thanks.

,,,,,The most quaint and charming restaurant along Pike Place! Truly a hidden gem. I would recommend making a reservation - ask for a table with waterfront views.
,,,,,"Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night.  Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:"
,,,,,"-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta"
,,,,,"- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp).  Broth was light, could have used more seasoning"
,,,,,"- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good"
,,,,,Overall good spot if you can get a reservation...
,,,,,"I love this place! I had bread with olive oil and balsamic, the Brussels and a short rib polenta.I split it with a friend because portions allowed so. I also enjoyed a rose hip to your lips off the drink menu and if you're in to floral flavors you'll definitely enjoy. The ambiance decor and the view are amazing. Really enjoyed myself here will definitely be back."

,,,,,"Ok so just left and I have to say thank you so much to Chip Reed? I think is his name? Wow what an amazing server. The food was awesome but our server was even more awesome!!! That was a great and much needed experience for us!! Just wanted you to know you made our night ,Chip! Thank you so much!!! "
,,,,,And those cocktails were heavenly!!!
,,,,,"After hearing about this place numerous times I finally had the chance to check it out. It's in a prime location, steps away from Pike Place however there's no sign for the restaurant. It's just a cute door painted bright pink that stands out from the brick and stone road. There is definitely a right and wrong time to go here as they get busy pretty quick. Saturday afternoon was almost perfect. We were seated promptly, waiting no more than 5 minutes. The ambiance was so cute - a mix of vintage with Italian themes. Their menu selection seemed a bit limited (1 page for food), but that just means they make everything fresh in house. The food was fantastic 10/10. It was fresh and flavorful. However, the portions were small and the prices were a bit high. "
,,,,,"What made our experience not so great was that our waiter seemed to be rushing us as they were transitioning from lunch to dinner. We never got any bread, and they forgot the semolina gnocchi in my plate. Both sets of silverware also had dried food on them as well. "
,,,,,"I would definitely come here again since the food is so good, but maybe hope for an even slower time of day so that everything's perfect."
,,,,,"I went here when I was starving. The menu wasn't impressive and I had a hard finding food to order. It's supposed to be high end, yet they don't have their own bathroom. Your sharing a bathroom with other community restaurants. This place is another tourist trap you should avoid."
,,,,,"I've been wanting to go here for so long and finally was able to nab a reservation! The restaurant's ambience is classic and the place really gives off a classy, timeless vibe. Perfect spot for a special date night (or maybe a proposal like the couple next to us!)"
,,,,,"I'm vegetarian, and despite what I'd heard, I found the vegetarian options to be pretty numerous. We ordered a burrata + beet root and a garlic bread appetizer. The beet root dish was especially good and a great vegetarian option. "
,,,,,"For main dishes, we ordered the spinach lasagna and the penne Al fumo. The lasagna was something special, with the sauce perfectly complementing the wholesome flavor of the spinach lasagna noodles. There were additional vegetarian options on the menu as well, including a risotto and a pumpkin ravioli. "
,,,,,"All in all, food was pretty good and the date night vibes were immaculate. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,"To say this one was of the best meals I've ever had would do this place justice. The live music, our server who knew exactly what we needed to try and the decorations, this place is unreal. When you go, ask for Sierra because she was so fun, great conversationalist, gave us the best advice on what to get and made us feel apart of the community even though we are out of state. She made our experience at this restaurant better than we could have expected! Thanks, Sierra!"
,,,,,The food here was spectacular! We came for our anniversary and they gave us a gorgeous corner table over looking the water. We cannot say enough good things about this place!!
,,,,,Came here by myself as a friend had recommended it but I had no idea what to expect. Had a delicious cocktail that I can't remember the name of but I know it had gin and it was delicious. 
,,,,,"I sat at the bar and there was a group of ladies from San Diego who were very friendly and another girl from LA who was also there by herself. The gang of us stayed at pink door for the burlesque show, which was amazing! Deff recommend, but be warned VERY Risqué"
,,,,,"Good vibes Good food and Good service. Went on a Saturday with no reservation around 4:50pm, right before they opened and was able to get a table for 5. Had excellent service and good food throughout the night. Ordered two appetizers, the arancini and another appetizer (figs, prosciutto, and arugula?). The arancini was really good and the second app wasn't my taste. I ordered the linguine alle vongole which was really good. The clams and pancetta were very flavorful and really made the dish for me."
,,,,,"God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it."
,,,,,"We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside."
,,,,,"The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits."
,,,,,"I had high hopes for this place based off the reviews...sadly I was let down. Limited menu due to covid. Ordered the herb fries (no flavor) aioli taste like mayo and mustard. I had my heart set on the linguini gambari, unfortunately the restaurant was out of the prawns (crazy being that we're by the fish market, nvm haha) the chef offered any meat topping to my liking so I got salmon (bland) the linguini, bland. Whole meal needed salt and pepper (none on table due to covid) The chef did comp my meal due to the prawn outtage(grateful) customer service was great and so was the view. Sad to say I can't say I would return or suggest this place."

,,,,,"A quaint, hidden gem of a dining experience tucked away in the bustling city of Seattle. The Pink Door is an inconspicuous restaurant raved by critics of all sorts. "
,,,,,"First of all, be warned that they will not take walk-ins. Like many others, I had to make a reservation a day prior. The bookings fill up fast so it's literally a game of luck. "
,,,,,Finding the Pink Door was not really a struggle for me. But I can see why many others find it difficult to spot this elusive place. However it is well worth the extra effort. 
,,,,,Recommendation: 
,,,,,"Clam linguine. Hands down one of the best clam linguine I've had in my entire existence. Usually I am not a big fan of clam linguine because the execution of this simple dish holds far more complication than just butter, lemon, and white wine-- which many restaurants fail to captivate the true flavor. The Pink Door however has perfected this dish in such decadence that it is really hard to beat anywhere. The pasta was cooked perfectly and was marinated quite well within the sauce. NO sand!! Which is a huge plus. And also might I add, some actual flavor. GET THIS DISH!"
,,,,,"The Pink Door is such a difficult restaurant to get a reservation to especially pre-COVID. This time around, I didn't think that was the case. We booked our reservation 2 weeks before and got lucky! Also, if you're not a local this may be difficult to find. It's behind Beecher's Cheese down the Alley Shops across from the wine tasting room- to me it looks more like a peach colored door. "
,,,,,"Our food was great! Definitely a good spot for date night. We ordered the meat and cheese board. Loved the cheese - brie and sharp manchego cheddar. It came with proscuitto, copola ham (not a fan), salami, cauliflower, apple slices, and fun jams. There was a cracker on top :) Big enough to share between 2 people. My entree was the linguini with clams which was SO good! I nearly licked the plate clean. My husband ordered the lasagna and was not disappointed either. Our cocktails of choice were the Manhattan type cocktail and the Black Lives Matter cocktail in support of the #BLM movement. WOW! The bread with olive oil was just to die for! Unforgettable meal :)"
,,,,,"The seating included the outdoor patio, wherein we felt safe and we wore our masks with every interaction with servers. Thank you for opening again!"
,,,,,"Overpriced and food wasn't the greatest. I would have to say the place itself is cute and pretty unique with and awesome view. I would recommend this place more for it's drinks than they food. They also gave me hard accommodating my baby stroller. I had to leave it at the entrance even though I mentioned that my baby was asleep, they did no care at all ."
,,,,,The Pink Door is straight fire.
,,,,,Background: In Seattle  for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came  on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew  this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later.  Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty   of getting a reservation.
,,,,,The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly  and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
,,,,,"Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night."
,,,,,What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
,,,,,Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
,,,,,Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown. 
,,,,,Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing. 
,,,,,Service:Great all the way around.
,,,,,Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
,,,,,Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
,,,,,Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in.
,,,,,"I NEVER review anything, but I can't say enough about this place - and I'm vegan! They don't have many options for plant-based eaters but did anything and everything they could to accommodate, on top of providing a complementary glass of bubbly for me and my partner (it was our anniversary) and sitting us in the cutest corner next to a window overlooking Pike Place Market and Elliot Bay. Staff was INCREDIBLE. Food was DELICIOUS. Place was decorated so cool and fun. A must in Seattle for you and your friends / partners!"
,,,,,"We've been looking forward to coming here for weeks. I'm so glad we made reservations because when we got there 5 mins before opening, there was already a group of people waiting.  By the time we were seated, the place was almost filled up.  "
,,,,,I'd remarked on our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary (15 years!!) and when we sat down the server brought out complimentary glasses of Prosecco for toasting.  What a special touch!  
,,,,,"We ordered several things I can't pronounce but this has to be one of the top tasting meals I've had.  I always tell everyone about Mesa Grill in Vegas as the place I've had my best meal ever but this definitely rivals it.  Such friendly staff, such great service, we will be back every time we are in town for sure."
,,,,,"When planning our weekend trip to Seattle literally every person we spoke to told us we had to go to The Pink Door for dinner so we were really pleased when we were able to get a reservation. The restaurant itself is super charming and hidden off of one of the alley's but once you enter it really opens up to be a rather large and well designed cozy space with beautiful views. Coming from the Napa/SF area we are really exposed to great food and while everything was completely fine here nothing really blew us away. The experience, the service, and the location were fantastic and the food was just fine. We just weren't blown away by anything enough to even remember what we had eaten but if we were in Seattle again we'd definitely give this a try. *Disclaimer: we are food snobs that are lucky to live in an area with exceptional restaurants so we are tough critics."
,,,,,"We love love love this place! The food was wonderful! The views were amazing and the restaurant itself was beautiful! I would highly recommend this place if you are wanting to do a nice fun night. Also, the entrance is somewhat tricky, it is literally the cute pink door."
,,,,,"I came here because of the great reviews. The patio does not open until april, so we sat next to the window. The staff was super nice. "
,,,,,I ordered the meat pappardelle and my boyfriend got a seafood dish. 
,,,,,"I gave it three stars because my noodles were under cooked. They were stuck together and hard. For the rest of the noodles that were cooked, it was great. "
,,,,,So 3 stars for a pasta restaurant messing up on pasta. The seafood pasta was lighter and cooked to perfection.
,,,,,"One of our go-to date spots, love Pink Door! Favorite seats are at the bar - fun bartenders, ample space to enjoy lovely live music and jazz while indulging in delicious house pastas."
,,,,,"Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente. "
,,,,,"Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here. "
,,,,,"Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna"
,,,,,"Service is friendly and professional - have always enjoyed excellent service at the bar. Reservations are recommended as waits can be formidable during peak hours, but if you come by on a whim, just put your name down and enjoy a drink at Radiator Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer or any of the fun bars nearby!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,This restaurant is one of my new favorites in Seattle. The indoor and outdoor areas are comfortable. Restaurant was very clean with great socual distancing. Staff were all friendly and helpful with fast service. The food was outstanding! Try the oysters and basil cake as well.
,,,,,"Probably my favorite restaurant in Seattle...Pink Door never disappoints. I really appreciate the consistency of the quality of food and service! The perfect restaurant for casual dining with family or friends, and a romantic date night!"
,,,,,Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
,,,,,Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
,,,,,"Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!"
,,,,,"Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!"
,,,,,Tuscan Fries with Fried Herbs | The aioli is so tasty that we can't stop snacking on these fries!! Wish the flavors of the herbs are stronger...
,,,,,So glad to have checked Yelp to find this place! We loved our lunch of cioppino and clam linguini. The seafood was fresh and to say they didn't skimp would be an understatement. Honestly what made our meal though was the service we received from our server/bartender Aaron. He was so friendly from the moment we sat down and was very attentive. my wife commented that she had the best mock-tails she's ever had at his recommendation. Can't wait to go back.
,,,,,Amazing ambience served with amazing food. A little expensive but the view from the balcony makes it totally worth it. A perfect dine in spot!
,,,,,"The staff was incredible. Our waitress was nice and was always checking on us to make sure we were good. Even the busboy was kind to us and greeted us on our way out. The food was a little overpriced, but definitely good and very filling."
,,,,,I have been stopping in since they opened in the early '80's.  
,,,,,Always a healthy mental / emotional escape from a fast paced day to reflect on the finer elements of living.  
,,,,,Great food.  
,,,,,Great live entertainment.  
,,,,,Beautiful environment.  
,,,,,"Wonderful, respectful, and talented staff.  "
,,,,,Always a feel of great company even when I stop in by myself - while always recommended to share the experience with another.
,,,,,"Great experience, start to finish.  They were serious about COVID protocol on check in, which was appreciated.  The bar area and dining room are eclectically decorated, and were hopping but not overly loud the night we were there.  Service was just right - efficient and prompt, never rushed.  The server stayed out of our business but he also gave two spot-on recommendations when asked.  The cocktails were precise and delicious.  All of our entrees - two pasta dishes and two cioppinos were great, and the appetizers, salad, and even bread were also superb.  Special nod to the Caesar dressing that had the acid and salt turned up an extra notch, which our table loved."
,,,,,"It's hard to get a reservation for this place as it gets booked months and months in advance. Imagine my surprise and happiness when we snatched up an available lunch time that worked for a party of 2! We were also visiting from out of town, so really happy that it all worked out. "
,,,,,"You can also be on standby and wait for a table, but it can be a long wait. "
,,,,,FOOD
,,,,,We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup. 
,,,,,"The rabbit ragu pasta was better than I expected. The meat was tender, and the pasta had texture. "
,,,,,Cioppino soup was delicious! Exceeded my expectations a lot. There were plentiful pieces of seafood. I would recommend dipping the complimentary bread with the soup. I was full after the dish. 
,,,,,SERVICE
,,,,,The servers were very attentive with refilling our water. 
,,,,,PARKING
,,,,,"It's in the heart of pike place where post ally is. If you are driving, there are parking available nearby."
,,,,,"3.5 bumped up to 4. I loved the lasagna. Every thing else was good, not great.  Lamb was good, rigatoni with meatball was good, kids pizza was okay. Pizza was very soggy in the middle, but had a lot of cheese which my nephew enjoyed. "
,,,,,"As a tourist, I wouldn't go here. First, it's hard to get a reservations and second it doesn't seem like a special ""only in Seattle"" type of place or serve food that you couldn't find anywhere else. With that said, if I lived here I would come back for that lasagna frequently. "
,,,,,"Also, I didn't see any signage but there is very clearly a pink door to go in."
,,,,,"We stopped in a wine and Chocolate store and they recommended we come here for dinner.  We did say we wanted a view of the water.  When we walked in they said that they were changing shifts and it would be 15-20 minutes before they sat anyone else outside.  We sat at the bar, ordered a bee happy and the celery made me do it.  They were interesting.  I liked the uniqueness.  Didn't love. But that's ok.  It was worth trying.  After sitting for about 30 minutes and seeing others being seated outside, my husband went to the hostess for an update.  They had indeed changed shifts and she did not know anything about it.  Unfortunately the outdoor seating had now been reserved and was full.  "
,,,,,We asked to close out the tab.  The bartender knew we had came to eat and asked if anything was wrong.  We told her they forgot about us and we really wanted a view so we were just going to walk down the road and see if we could find something else.  They went to get the bill and when they came back they asked if they could sea

,,,,,"This restaurant is absolutely stunning. It's classy and romantic. The band which plays jazz and funky songs from different eras and cultures only adds to the ambiance. We were originally seated in their beautiful dining room, but when we asked to be seated in the lounge with the band, they were able to immediately accommodate us with no problem. The service is so on point with the servers so attentive and even the bussers don't miss a beat. My husband dropped his napkin on the floor when he got up to use the restroom and they quickly replaced it with a new folded napkin on top of the table. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious! The 1/2 order of the antipasto was still a fair amount. The meats, cheese and bean salad were so refreshing. The sausage and smoked mozzarella in the Fussiloni gave the perfect al dente pasta the right amount of saltiness, the pine nuts gave it a nice crunch and the Rapini added the freshness you need in a pasta dish. My husband loved his steak and it was cooked a perfect medium. I had my birthday dinner here and I felt so special. If I have the opportunity to come back to Seattle, I will definitely return to see their aerial dancers."
,,,,,A place I will be back and try the rests on the menu for sure! Very comfy environment and delicious food indeed!
,,,,,"My friends and I stopped in to the Pink Door for some drinks on the patio. As others have mentioned, there is no sign for the Pink Door, just a pink door off an alley. It was a lovely sunny day and we got one of the last tables. There is a bit of shade, but we were mostly in the sun. The patio is pretty decently sized which was great. I wanted something refreshing since it was pretty warm out, so I ordered a seasonal watermelon margarita. It was definitely refreshing! Not super sweet and a great patio cocktail. I really wish we had been hungry, because the pasta dishes all looked amazing. I'd stop in again for a light lunch. The interior was a little weird to me; the decor was a mix of vintage circus/clown themed items. I probably watched the 90s TV version of Stephen King's It way too young but the clowns just creeped me out."
,,,,,"However, The Pink Door was listed as one of the Top 100 Most Romantic Restaurants in 2019 AND 2020, with it being #1 in 2020. So be sure to check it out for date night or Valentine's Day next year!"
,,,,,"We came here for a late dinner two days before Valentine's Day recently and it was a coincidence and ironic that Yelp San Francisco listed this restaurant as the #1 romantic spot for this year. I had made reservations 5 days before the night we dined here, but it was only for bar seating as there was no available spots in the dining room that entire night."
,,,,,"I was very surprised when we checked in with the hostess and we were seated at a table right by the stage, where the band was set up. When I looked around after we we were seated, I was very impressed with the decor and mood of this restaurant. The Linguine Alle Vongole(baby clams, pancetta, garlic, chili and white wine) was the best I've ever had. It was so flavorful, a little spicy, and literally every shell still had the clam inside. We shared the Sicilian Fennel Orange Salad(Cara oranges, red onion, watercress, castelvetrano, and oil cured olives). This salad was light, flavorful, and recommended."
,,,,,"Our waitress was amazing. She was so cheerful, quick, friendly, and welcoming. The band was playing old time jazz and it was very soothing. Overall, between the ambiance, food, and service, I was extremely impressed and I cannot wait to return to Seattle to dine here again."
,,,,,Good food. I've read so much about this place. One of my favorites in the alley. I think the price point was about right and service was good.
,,,,,"The Pink Door is as amazing as everyone else claims it to be! From the unseemly entrance to the beautiful view and decor, this place has earned its prestige as one of the best Italian restaurants around. "
,,,,,"With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront."
,,,,,"They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors."
,,,,,This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance.
,,,,,Wow!! I'm Italian and this place blew me away!! The food is incredible but the service is even better. Tonight I sat at the bar top and was helped by Angel and Aaron. Both amazing bartenders. 
,,,,,"Aaron made the most impressive rounds of beverages that I've had in a long time. Looking for good specialty drink and food, you need to come here."
,,,,,The Pink Door is a perfect Seattle place to eat.
,,,,,"My friend and I went for lunch and Ryan was our server.  We felt welcome.  The food, service, and the view cannot be beat.  I cannot say enough good things about the Pink Door."
,,,,,"The food was so scrumptious here. We had the flank steak and squid ink spaghetti. The ambiance was very romantic, and luckily, we were seated right by the windows overlooking the pier. Highly recommend this place."
,,,,,"Wow, are you kidding me? Unreal!! Ambiance, food, service, everything is a 10/10. My dinner here was the epitome of a perfect dining experience and made our casual Tuesday feel like Valentine's Day. "
,,,,,"Ambiance - Spacious, romantic, dim (but not too dim), amazing live entertainment and breathtaking views of the waterfront. "
,,,,,"Food - A-maz-ing. After that Pink Door Lasagna, I went home and dreamed about it. For appetizers, our mushroom Crostini was delicious and you simply cant go wrong with some fries and aioli sauce. Portions were more than enough and there was flavor in every bite. Those zeppole doughnuts we ordered for dessert were absolutely perfect. That lemon flavor?!? Chef's kiss. "
,,,,,"Service - Not even a second after my water cup was empty it was immediately refilled, and consistently done so throughout the night. The servers here really pay close attention to all their guests and we really felt  acknowledged and heard. "
,,,,,"Overall, a lovelyyyy restaurant that deserves all the hype it gets."

,,,,,"Wow.  I really like this place.  This is a must for a getaway to Seattle.  It is a great place to get Seattle's finest Seafood Italian food at a bargain price in a comfortable setting.  It's right in the heart of Seattle near Pikes Market with both inside and outdoor dining.  The four of us had the Clam Linguine, Cioppino, Mussels and clams, arancini, and insalad.  This is the kind of place that for every visit to Seattle, you'll try to do it again."
,,,,,We dined here pre covid and raved about the experience and food for a very long time. We went this week to celebrate a birthday and we were let down big time. 
,,,,,"The restaurant has Idiotic covid rules (including wearing your mask when the waiter/waitress approaches the table). 2 hour dining window (due to covid, how does that help anyone stay healthy?). "
,,,,,"Server was nice but antisocial, I am also a server so I would consider my evaluation fair. "
,,,,,"To put it simply, the number of times Covid and restrictions were mentioned during our dinner ruined the experience, when you go out you want to forget about the current issues not be reminded of them. "
,,,,,"The server also took the receipt before we left the table which feels unprofessional.  If you're looking for a charming and different experience, this is not the place (at least right now). Althought the food was still amazing, the magic is missing."
,,,,,"I always bring friends here. It never disappoints. I've now eaten in the front room, in the gorgeous main dining room, and outside. All are satisfying in their own ways. And the food...! I literally daydream about the food for days after a visit. I could walk you through details of each course from a lunch with a friend last week. This is my favorite ""special"" restaurant in town. Bar none."
,,,,,"I came here on a Friday night and it was very busy. I put my name in and was told it would be over an hour, but ended up getting seated within 30-45 minutes. I just went across the alley to The Tasting Room as I waited for our table to get ready. For appetizers, we ordered their grilled garlic bread and a half order of the antipasto. The antipasto came with meats, fresh cheese,  pickled vegetables, and spreads. "
,,,,,"For my entree, I ordered the linguine alle vongole aka clam linguine. This was very good and it came with a lot of clams. They give you a bucket to put the shells into and the whole bucket was full by the time I was done with my pasta. I thought this dish was very good and would recommend getting. Another cool thing about this place is they had live jazz music playing, which made for a cool ambiance. Overall, I would definitely come back here to try other dishes."
,,,,,Interesting decor.
,,,,,I couldn't figure out a theme. But I liked it. 
,,,,,Meatballs? Yum.
,,,,,"Meatballs should be bouncy. Not too rough, too chunky, too mushy. There's this balance it needs. And they hit the spot. Fantastic."
,,,,,Seasoning was fantastic.
,,,,,Pasta. Fantastic.
,,,,,"Usually with pasta, it makes me feel heavy, or the pasta flavor over powers the sauce or the sauce over powers the pasta. I feel like this place understands balance amongst all things and performs."
,,,,,I am definitely surprised by the restaurant and definitely come back.
,,,,,Def top ten for me in italian restaurants I've been to.
,,,,,Good vibes. The waitress was super helpful on recommendations. The place was low key and a little hard to find but the atmosphere is amazing. Everything was delicious but they can work on the pasta
,,,,,"One of the best meals in Seattle so far. Reservations are hard to come by luckily we got a late lunch time. A mission to find, we walked up and down the alleys and finally found the hidden place. Somehow missed the link door and pink bars. We got the eggplant Crostini, mixed olives, pappardelle al Ragu, risotto, and pumpkin bread. Everything was delicious. The ragu was perfect balance of meaty and creamy. The risotto was delicious. They didn't have the chocolate ball for dessert so we went with the pumpkin bread. Absolutely loved everything. We were stuck between the cheese board and the Crostini for apps, ultimately decided the cheese board would be too much food. "
,,,,,This place is a must try!
,,,,,"Yum!!! This classic Seattle spot is super popular and in a great location. It gets so busy that I recommend making a reservation on their website at least a week or two in advance. Since it's in downtown Seattle (Pike Place Market) the parking can be a little hard, you have to get lucky."
,,,,,"As a vegan, I've been twice and both times have been served with great vegan options. Most of their pasta and breads are vegan, and they make a delicious tomato sauce and once served me pasta with olive oil and seasonal veggies! I absolutely loved their focaccia bread. "
,,,,,"This place is so cute and aesthetic, and not too expensive for a fancier meal. You need to try this spot if you're ever in town, it's a known and classic favorite."
,,,,,"Not as great as I expected, but I had some high expectations. The sea food tasted fresh, but was nothing special. There was live music which was fun but the atmosphere was not as great as expected."
,,,,,"Worth the hype! Located right in the heart of Pike Place, Pink Door is one of the must-visit restaurants in Seattle. The space is vibey and the food is delish! "
,,,,,"Reservations are a must since this place is so popular. If you do end up walking in, you might have to wait upwards of an hour and a half. There is no sign but you won't miss the pink door that leads to the restaurant. "
,,,,,"For the food, you probably can't go wrong but I do recommend at least trying one of their meat/seafood dishes. The Special of the Day fish was the best dish I had! "
,,,,,Here's the food I tried (fave to least fave):
,,,,,"1. ""BRANZINO STYLE"" Whole White Fish of the Day: this was seriously amazing. I know they're known for their pasta but this dish blew me out of the water. The fish was so delicate and inside was stuffed with fresh crab. Every thing on that dish brought out the fish's flavor. "
,,,,,"2. Lasagna Pink Door: Consists of fresh spinach pasta layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara sauce, and baked. It's super creamy and decadent. Seriously a fave. "
,,,,,3. Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese: House made pappardelle with tomato based meat sauce topped with freshly grated Parmesan. This was good but not as good as the other two.

,,,,,Best Italian food I've ever had in the US! The lasagna is AMAZING! The bread and salad are delicious! The pasta is just so good! The ambiance is lovely and great customer service. Wonderful restaurant! Highly recommend!
,,,,,"I can see why this place has such good reviews! Overall the food was delicious and the service was great! We had the bruschetta (which probably was my least favorite but only because the moisture from the tomatoes made the bread chewy) and ahi tuna crudo for our starters, then the bolognese and lasagna as our mains, then finished off with the semifreddo and poached cherries for dessert! We finished every last bite! I was a little bummed at first because the only table available for 2 was outside which ended up being ok because we got a view and the lights on the patio turn on at night. We were also able to hear the live music being played from inside. This place is definitely a must eat when in the area!"
,,,,,Loved it so much we came here twice on a 4day trip. Highly recommend the Lasagna but the Bolognese is what took it over the top for us. Very cozy atmosphere with nice lights and candles everywhere as well as artsy pieces. Services and drinks were great both times we came here as well.
,,,,,"AMAZING!!! Servers were so friendly, had many suggestions for tourists. So cheap for how yummy"
,,,,,It is!!
,,,,,This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle. The lasagna is the best I have had anywhere (sorry grandma!) and everything I have had there has been amazing.
,,,,,The atmosphere here was amazing. I love the interior design & concept. The food was okay to me. Nothing too special.
,,,,,"Was visiting and passed through the alley and the pink door stood out. Reservations were booked up for weeks but we were able to get a table as walk ins shortly after they opened for dinner. Everything was amazing - food, wine, service, ambiance."
,,,,,Go down the stairs to a magical mystery world. 
,,,,,I've been here a bunch. Not sure if my favorite memory is sipping whiskey with my dad all the way in the back while listening to a jazz duo. Or Mother's Day on the charming patio. Or watching my out of town guests' jaws drop when a trapeze artist twirled above us.

,,,,,"I discovered The Pink Door through Yelp. Difficult not to notice their 5K+ reviews on Yelp. During the days leading up to Valentine's day last month, Yelp San Francisco published a list of the most romantic restaurants in the US on Instagram, and Pink Door was in the Number One spot. Coincidentally and fortuitously, we already had reservations for that same day. Call it kismet fortune."

We were seated right next to the jazz band stage and while they were taking a break, it allowed us to really soak in the atmosphere. I found myself smiling and intrigued simultaneously. I decided to order the Linguine Alle Vongole and we shared the Sicilian Fennel Orange Salad. Both dishes were masterful, flavorful, and light to the palate, which I prefer when it comes to Italian food. The live jazz band added another delicious layer to this whole experience."
,,,,,"Our waitress was delightful, cheery, and wonderfully efficient all night long. I may say this from time to time in my reviews(that I wish to return to try more of the menu from a certain establishment), but when it comes to The Pink Door, I pray with a passion that I will have the opportunity to return as soon as possible."

,,,,,I haven't been here since I first moved to Seattle but it is still as great as I remember it! Everything was amazing but ESPECIALLY the rose poached nectarine dessert. MY GOD this was the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth. 
,,,,,My only complaint was the server kept taking away my plate with food still on it & I wanted every last bite.
,,,,,The 4.5 star and the number of reviews for this restaurant is truly puzzling. I definitely agree with another yelper that has a similar view. 
,,,,,"Sure the restaurant has good service, ambience, view, and price point. But to rave about its food is truly puzzling. My girlfriend and I had the ahi tuna, claims with linguini, and the pappardelle. Subpar across the board. Left disappointed with the food. Both pasta plates lack flavor and needed seasoning. The ahi tuna was average but was slightly better than the pasta dishes. "
,,,,,Summary: Meh
,,,,,Make a reservation because the waitlist fills up too. Maybe next time Seattle. Wish we could've enjoyed.
,,,,,"This place is delicious! Aside from the appetizer, my friend and I got the clam pasta dish and I got a red sauce dish. Both were immaculate! It is a little pricy but if you're willing to spend a little more and get great food, service, and complimentary bread (we love that) then this place is great!"
,,,,,"I made the reservation  a week ahead and it's worthy! The food is perfect, I had the best squid ink pasta I've ever had. The atmosphere is really romantic, warm, and welcoming. It's a perfect spot for night out and date night. You can enjoy the ocean view while enjoying your food. Their wine is tasty and smooth as well."
,,,,,"Try the lasagna and the bolognese! We had to come here twice during our Seattle trip because it was that good! I usually don't like bolognese but theirs was good. The portions are meant for 1-2 people or just 1 if you're really hungry, but I was with people who are constantly on a diet so two people shared an entree. "
,,,,,"The place is a little hard to find since there's no sign but it's right by the Irish pub/restaurant. If you go past the stairs, you've gone too far. The staff are nice. They did let us do walk ins both times but reservations are the better way to go. They told us the wait was going to be an hour and 15 minutes but luckily we got the text that we're able to come in after only 45 minutes. Worth it though. "
,,,,,"There is seating outside and depending on where you are outside, you can get a good view of the water."
,,,,,"Came to Seattle for my sister's birthday celebration and was given the recommendation from several people and blogg reviews to come here. Place is very cute and dishes were savory and flavorful, but I was not happy with the service. Our server forgot to bring the cocktail menu after being asked a 2nd time, brought out and served us the incorrect bottle of wine, and advertised desserts that were not available. Overall felt rushed and not able to ask for assistance because he was busy socializing with his other tables. A simple check in or perhaps better attention to detail would have made this experience more fulfilling."
,,,,,We ordered take out on a whim after craving lasagna.
,,,,,"The vegetarian lasagna was very disappointing. We have had lasagna many times and can safely say this was the most disappointing. It's just layers of pasta with the tiniest smattering of pesto, making is very stodgy and dry. The ""sauce"" that came with it was so sparse that it will barely stretch to 4 servings.  We didn't realize it was vegetarian when ordering it as the menu doesn't mention the word vegetarian anywhere. "
,,,,,The deep fried Brussels sprouts were inedible because they were basically drenched in oil. I understand why I have never seen them on a menu before.
,,,,,"The only good thing were the fries, which we enjoyed with the very tasty aioli. "
,,,,,"When I called up to discuss my disappointing meal, the person I spoke to bluntly said ""oh well, that's how we make it"". We typically avoid Italian restaurants because, thanks to cooking shows and awesome recipe books, it's not particularly challenging to make simple Italian food well at home. I guess that's why I expect the food to be better in a restaurant. "
,,,,,"But I was tired and their lasagna was on a list of best lasagnas in Seattle. Never again. It's one thing to make crappy food, but then to just bluntly dismiss someone's disappointment, it's totally unacceptable. If I had dined out in the restaurant, you would have taken it back and brought me something else. But because it's take out, you don't feel obliged to care."
,,,,,Wanted to eat somewhere Italian and landed upon this place. Wait time was around 30 minutes but it was totally worth the wait. The atmosphere was amazing and they had their own jazz players who came in to play amazing music. Seated near the window with an amazing view while eating. Ordered their meatball and rigatoni dish and was amazed by how much flavor the dish had. The pricing was a bit high but it was worth it at the end and would totally come back here to eat again.
,,,,,"This place is pretty good, i tried the risotto and the lasagna. Both were really tasty, the lasagna was really hot and fresh and the layers were so thin, it was great. It's vegetarian but you don't miss the meat, same with the risotto. The menu is on the smaller side though, I wish there were more pasta options. The service is good, but make sure you have a reservation."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,A must visit if you're in the city.  The view of the water from the patio was beautiful and the food was authentic and delicious.
,,,,,I love the risotto and garlic bread. Great time in the evening for live entertainment.  Quintessential Seattle experience
,,,,,"Stumbled upon this little pink hole in the wall and was charmed by its cozy rustic decor and foggy view of Seattle. Service was excellent. Food was great: we tried the black cod fall special (cod cooked to tender perfection topped with tapenade and sitting on charred broccolini) and the pasta al Fumo (eggplant mozz penne). Both were delish, but the cod was really special."
,,,,,Loved the linguine pasta! The clams tasted really fresh with the garlicky white wine sauce! It would have been better if the pasta was handmade in house. They provide complimentary bread with olive oil. It is also good to just dip the bread in the white wine sauce if you get this pasta.
,,,,,HARD TO GET IT BUT DEFINITELY WORTH THE HASSLE. This place has a reason to believe the hype. My gf and I camped at the door about 15 minutes early to get in for dinner at 5:00PM and there was already a line. 
,,,,,We ordered the Mussels and Clams which is a certified hit  make sure you ask for extra sauce to dip the bread with. My gf ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole which was really good and full of flavor. To drink we ordered off the menu strawberry sidecars crazy good .
,,,,,"My girlfriend made a reservation for a vacation anniversary dinner. We expected dinner and a show; however the show was short 2-3 minute routines every so often. That said, the staff was very accommodating when we arrived VERY late because of traffic. The food was... DELICIOUS! There were multiple vegetarian options. We started with the grilled garlic bread, which was the right mix of garlic and pepper. The potato gnocchi was flavorful with tons of vegetables mixed in. The flank steak came with a delightful cream and lemon sauce, but the secret was the anchovies in it, I would never of guessed. I topped it off with a a dark and stormy, with a unique twist. Would highly recommend a stop in but make sure you have a reservation."
,,,,,We booked this restaurant because it was suggested to us on our road trip through Seattle. 
,,,,,Pros
,,,,,"Our server was awesome! I had a small problem with my drink, he offered to fix it and when he brought it back, the bartender had fixed it 100%! And he offered to have it fixed when I said I didn't really care for it. I would have been fine paying for it not drinking it. I really appreciated that!"
,,,,,Their bread and oil was heavenly. Really yummy! 
,,,,,The oysters with a shaved ice with balsamic vinegar was a solid 10! My husband is a foodie as he's very creative in the kitchen and really loved this dish! Actually that was the highlight of his meal there.
,,,,,Meatballs and sauce were good.
,,,,,Cons
,,,,,"Ciopini ... On a scale of 1 to 10 my husband would give that a six. He often eats this dish at different restaurants and if we went back here, he would definitely not get this dish again. But keep in mind this is an Italian restaurant."
,,,,,"The Gulf shrimp and risotto. I love risotto. And I thought Gulf shrimp were supposed to be larger than what they served. And I can overlook the size of the shrimp, no problem. But the risotto!!! That was just a little disappointing. It was very liquidy."
,,,,,"Although, we didn't love out entrees, we would still go back here another time to try what they're known for which is their lasagna. There were no reservations at night to see a show so we ate rather early which was fine since we were on East Coast time.."
,,,,,"The food was good and so were the drinks, the ambience was lovely, but my God was it overpriced. I've had food and drinks this good at half the price in the area. "
,,,,,"Go if you have money to burn - it's an experience to remember - but if you just want great food and solid service, there are a lot of other good options around."
,,,,,"This place is magical. It was a little hard to find since they don't have a sign and you can only tell this place exists from its literal pink door, but it is a perfect place for some quality Italian food, a candlelit romantic atmosphere, and with a lovely view of the waterfront as well. I reserved a week in advance for dinner on a weeknight, and even though they ask for the occasion when you reserve, they don't really have anything special for mentioned occasion (in this case, a birthday dinner) but that's alright. "
,,,,,"We ended up ordering the arancini, fries, clam linguine, and the lasagna. There is also complimentary ciabatta bread with infused olive oil (pro tip: ask for some balsamic vinegar on the side) which was great bc honestly who doesn't like bread. The arancini was alright, but the fries really took the spotlight for apps. Their aioli is so rich in flavor that I literally couldn't stop eating it even after being beyond full post-entrees LOL. The clam linguine was also delicious and they were more than generous with the amount of clams! I definitely ran out of the linguine first in the dish haha. The lasagna here, though a little smaller than I had thought, was also extremely creamy and rich in flavor. "
,,,,,"The rich Italian food, lovely interior + atmosphere, and bay view made for a wonderful dinner experience on our first night in Seattle!"
,,,,,"The second time came to here, I want to say this time is perfect. I can try the ink pasta with seafood, it only had summer. Finally, the server is better that last one, she was very helpful. The last server when I had dinner in April , she was too bad too too bad."
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Obsessed! Cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! Love the service, love the setting, love the food, love the drinks! This place is alway a treat!"
,,,,,"First came here more than 10 years ago, then moved away. It was remarkable then and even better now. They've added a huge room with views of Elliott Bay (ask for it) and an already gorgeous restaurant has taken it to a new level of beauty. But let's talk about a staff that is warm, friendly and attentive. Walking to the rest room, a half dozen say hello. And the food? Well, it is exceptional, as well. Some great Italian dishes and lots of seafood. You will want to return, over and over again, as I have. It is memorable and inspiring."
,,,,,"We came in on the first night they began requiring vaccination cards, which was so comforting! We have been to Seattle before, and somehow never made the time to stop in. The restaurant is HUGE and the details throughout are stunning. We sat in the back side and had a beautiful view of the water. It's romantic and charming without being pretentious and stuffy. The staff are kind and attentive. Though I didn't care for my cocktail, their wine selection was pretty good. The bread is perfectly crisp and tears with gusto. The kitchen accommodated my veganism, and created a summer squash linguine. Truly, such a lovely meal. Left full and happy!"
,,,,,"We made lunch reservations online for a Saturday at 2:30pm and were promptly sat at our table after checking in. The table we sat at had a great view of the market place and overlooked the water front area. After I sat down, I noticed that the table was still dirty from the previous diners. I found it a bit unhygienic that there was a lipstick stain and breadcrumbs still on the tablecloth, especially given the mandated masks in the restaurant while not eating (due to the COVID pandemic). Of course, mistakes get made and things get overlooked, but the real issue I had with the situation is how our server (Zack B., based on the receipt) handled me bringing it up to his attention. In fact, he was a bit short and unprofessional and proceeded to ask me ""what I wanted him to do about it"". He even asked if the lipstick was from me. I then had to suggest if he could help lift the brown paper over to cover the tablecloth since the waters and plates had already weighted everything down. I did not want to accidentally touch someone else's lipstick while eating. Zack B. clearly was not planning on offering to get someone to promptly change the tablecloth. All he did say was that he would address this situation with the busser, essentially placing the blame on another person. I did not hear anything else regarding this matter after he said he would relay the message to the busser (and we did not even get a final apology for the tablecloth from him when we got the check). In fact, after this incident, I noticed he was very short with us each time he came to the table to serve drinks/food. I also noticed that he wasn't acting in the same short manner with other tables. That left a bad impression because I can understand if he may have just been having a bad day, but he was acting a rude with just our table. The food itself was good and the seafood was fresh, but I would have enjoyed it more thoroughly had we had a nicer server. We split the linguine alle vongole and the cioppino pink door. The linguine was cooked al dente, seasoned generously with pancetta, and topped with clams. The cioppino had a deeply flavorful broth that was slightly spicy and packed with seafood. However, I could not justify the price point of each dish, especially with the experience we had with our server. This was so unfortunate since all the other restaurant staff we encountered were so friendly and professional. On our way out of the restaurant, multiple servers and staff thanked us for dining with them. Unfortunately, I will not be back to this restaurant and absolutely cannot recommend it to anyone."
,,,,,"Best food, service & setting "
,,,,,We had the best cioppino in the world 
,,,,,Papardelli was also wonderful 
,,,,,The bread and salads were fresh and tasty 
,,,,,Our server was pleasant and attentive
,,,,,"I've had so many people recommend me this place while I visit Seattle and it did not disappoint. The ambience and place itself was so pretty with views of pike place and the ferris wheel. I don't usually order linguine but after all the pictures of it on yelp, I had to order it! The linguine was DELICIOUS. They give you a generous amount of manila clams and the noodles were cooked to perfection. My plate was clean! If you're in Seattle you HAVE TO EAT HERE! The best pasta I've ever had."
,,,,,"This place is a must go to. Friendly enough staff, and extremely fast service. It is expensive but you get what you pay for which is amazing and good quality food. We all enjoyed our meals and we couldn't decide which one tasted best, if you're near the Pike Place area this is definitely worth a visit."
,,,,,"This place is beyond amazing. But wait when you first get to the location it does look a little sketchy just because it's in an alleyway and they really don't have a sign to the restaurant. It's pretty much just a pink door. The food was amazing and the drinks were even more amazing, even our waiter was super nice. The inside of it is just beautiful. There is beautiful Flowers hanging everywhere. We were lucky the weather was perfect we got to sit outside and we got a view of the water which was really nice."
,,,,,"This gem  is nestled on a lonely alley with no signage. The ambiance is outstanding, the service was top notch and the food was out of this world. My husband and I ordered the lasagna and the meatball sandwich and shared both items. To say that the food was delicious is an understatement. The lasagna was the best we had ever had. Made with homemade pasta and fine ingredients, the lasagna literally melted in my mouth. The meatball sandwich was also the best we had ever had. The restaurant had a beautiful view of the bay and did I mention how reasonable the prices were? OMG a must have if your are in the area and are craving an excellent Italian meal!"
,,,,,"We finally were able to dine at The Pink Door, and it exceeded all expectations.  I was told it was good, but The Pink Door is in Seattle's tourist central, and places in tourist areas are often bastions of mediocrity. "
,,,,,"With a lovely bottle of Amarone accompanying our meal, every dish was exquisite. There were five of us, and all I heard was oohs and aahs. The Pink Door cooked pasta beautifully, al dente, with a ""wash"" of sauce like the Italians do. More elegant than touristy, service at the Pink Door was sophisticated and warm. This restaurant is special and a Seattle treasure."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We were finally able to snag a lunch reservation at the Pink Door as restaurants very slowly open for dine-in. Boyfriend had the carpaccio, which was packed full of fresh tasty seafood, while I indulged in the NW mushroom risotto, which was rich and delicious. My little bottle of house red was an extra special late afternoon treat! That said, we we've had way better food in Seattle, so I'm not sure why this place is always so hyped (maybe the atmosphere, maybe the exclusivity, maybe the fact that it's a well-known tourist attraction in the center of Pike Place). It was good, don't get me wrong - just nothing to write home about, you know?"
,,,,,"Anyway, all standard COVID precautions were followed to a T (and even moreso than other places we'd been in a few months back; staff was very strict on mask wearing around anyone outside of our party). We felt safe indoors near open windows (+ not too cold), and hope to be able to return in a couple of months to eat outdoors in the Summer sun. (And to see if maybe the dinner menu can prove me wrong about this place)."
,,,,,"Heard a lot of hype about this place, so decided to try it out. They currently do not take any walk in. Finally got a reservation on a Wednesday night. Let me start with that this place is a tourist trap. Food here is at most average for this price point and the portion is small. My risotto came and it was cold, probably has been sitting there for awhile :( the Italian sausage in the risotto is under-seasoned and there are way more veggie and sausages in risotto than rice, flavor is very matured. In my own opinion, the veggie is way too bitter than it should be. This place was inedible for me. The Bolognese is average, pasta is fresh and that's about it. The doughnut holes were really really sweet and dense, it tasted more like cupcakes to me. Would not come back here again"
,,,,,Delightful atmosphere and wonderful food and cocktails!
,,,,,"Make a reservation, it's worth it!"
,,,,,Excellent food and atmosphere. The halibut was the best I've ever had in my life. Came in from Washington DC and this dining experience was worth the trip alone.
,,,,,"Loved the entire vibe and ambiance of this place!! Really enjoyed the food, the coffee, the view and the service! If we are ever back in Seattle, we will for sure be doing back here! The caprese salad was so delicate in flavor and the pasta was so decedent ! Highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,"One of our favorite spots in Seattle! Food was delicious, the arancini was soo decedent, as was the caprese salad. PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE was the best! Loved it here, def recommend it here and all patrons were vaccinated, was a great sense of security!"
,,,,,Leaving one star here. Went in was told an hour wait. Waited the hour only to be told that we couldn't eat there because my 11 year old child wasn't vaccinated. My husband and I both are and presented our cards. My daughter had a current negative test result as well (here for a cheer comp) but they refused us. My child was made to feel like something was wrong with her because she wasn't vaccinated. She left nearly in tears. The hostess was beyond rude about it as well. If these are your policies you should tell us BEFORE we wait an hour. Went one door down and the restaurant told us because she was under 12 she didn't need to be vaccinated or a negative test. They're just making up their own rules at this point... it's a child people!! Think! Terrible customer service all the way around. Wish I could leave no stars.
,,,,,Perfect food. Lola is the best!  Fine live jazz.
,,,,,I love the ambiance and the food is homey but elegant. Came here for a birthday dinner and absolutely loved it!! The lasagna is a must try.
,,,,,"One of my favorite restaurants in Seattle!  We stumbled upon this restaurant on OpenDoor and we realized it had to be good when the only available time during our week in Seattle was a Wed at 3:15 (two weeks before the date).  If you can snag a reservation, you should definitely go!  Highly recommend!  They gave us an outdoor table and the weather was beautiful!!  "
,,,,,We tried a couple of things: 
,,,,,"1. Tuna crudo: fresh, light, great sweet and salty flavor with the citrus and the capers.  A little too many capers for my taste, but you can always move some off!"
,,,,,"2. Short ribs: this is amazing, loved the Chianti sauce so much I asked the server for more to add on top of the short ribs. We finished every last bite "
,,,,,"3. Lasagna: this was unexpectedly amazingly spectacular.  I can understand why this has been on the menu for over 35 years, this is a must try!  Creamy, savory, and just so delicious that I definitely overstuffed eating an extra bite or two! "
,,,,,"4. Asparagus with a sunny side up egg: this was our way of getting our veggie intake for the day, definitely recommend the sunny side egg because it is fresh and came from the chef's hens and you definitely taste the freshness!! Only thing is, I'm still wondering if asparagus goes with eggs .. but that's okay, the other dishes left me more than satisfied"
,,,,,"5. Bread service: yes this deserves recognition even though it is complementary, the infused olive oil (rosemary, citrus zest) was delicious!! Had more bread than I normally have because the fresh bread with olive oil was that good! "
,,,,,"This is in the alley across the way from the tea and chocolate shops, super close to Pikes Place.  Definitely discreet with no signage and only thing is a light pink door with string lights."
,,,,,"Rather underwhelming for such a highly rated Italian restaurant. First of all, it takes weeks to get a reservation or be prepared to come very hungry for some late night spots around 9:30 right before they close. Secondly, the food is not that great. Very average, not authentic, not for foodies who love Italian. We got squid ink spaghetti and pappardelle bolognese. Only the Arancini was good but that's just an appetizer. Third, it's really expensive. For the prices they charge, in the Bay Area I would be eating at one of the best Italian places. But maybe that means I should just move back to the Bay or accept Seattle-level Italian food /shrug."

,,,,,"A wonderful, amazing staple of the Seattle experience. I love going to the Pink Door for special occasions. The view of the market and friendliness of the staff complements the amazing food here. The food here is just absolute perfection - fresh, delicious, and wonderfully seasoned. I cannot rave enough about how good the food here is. Come here if you want to splurge and have a wonderful time!"
,,,,,"Oof! Must have stopped by on an off day given all these outstanding reviews. The best part of our visit was the greeter at the door asking for our vaccine cards. Service was downhill from there. Our waitress was robotic and unfriendly. She took our orders after we sat idly for 20 minutes. Our first round of oysters came and they were extremely fishy. We did not finish these and our waitress whisked them away without a word. Our entrees came next. I got the renowned cioppino and my friend ordered the spaghetti. My cioppino was extremely watery and the fish smelled rotten. As a San Francisco native and seafood lover, I can assure you that this dish was not right. My friend noted his spaghetti tasted funky like the beef had gone sour also. He flagged down the waitress (he never does this) and asked if he could just order a plain salad. Once again, she whisked our plates away without any acknowledgement or apology. Service became increasingly uncomfortable when I noticed our waitress talk to various team members while glaring at our table. My friend's salad came out much later and it was just a plate of leaves for $20. The waitress decided this was also the appropriate time to ask if we wanted any dessert. Absolutely not. I was itching to leave and grab some real food at Pike's Market across the street, but somehow this entire disappointing ordeal took 1.5hrs to complete. Zero apologies, goodbyes, and thank yous from any of the team members. I was just scrolling through Yelp the entire time thinking: this is not my experience at all. 0/5 stars if I could."
,,,,,First recommendation - make a reservation. This place gets pretty busy. They have indoor and outdoor seating. 
,,,,,The staff was very nice and helpful. 
,,,,,Everything was very tasty. Crab cakes - it was their special that day. I don't know what the sauce was but it was really good. 
,,,,,Perfectly spiced linguine. Ask for more bread to dip it in the sauce! They offered more bread for us.
,,,,,"Wine - we ordered half carafe of their house wine. It was much more than two glasses! So if you are planning to order more than one glass or share it with someone, definitely order it and not by a glass."
,,,,,Loved this place for a burlesque event... the food was delicious! We weren't expecting to be able to order food since we hadn't preordered dinner. The cheese/meat plate was perfect for two people. We will definitely be back for cocktails and dinner as well as another show. Great service and venue.
,,,,,"My fiancé treated me to lunch here and I was super excited bc it's been on my to do list for awhile. Currently you have to show proof of vaccination to eat in. The decor is cute & our waiter was decent. I didn't know why he directed 99% of the conversation & questions to my man but whatever. I figured maybe he's low key sexist or maybe he's feelin my man? (He is fine so I wouldn't blame him though) lol anyways.. I ordered the mussels & clams & asked for extra broth. The waiter went through a very long drawn out explanation as to why he didn't know if it was possible to get extra broth. I would've preferred a simple ""I'll see what I can do."" My fiancé ordered the pasta with meatballs. I absolutely loved my  dish, the broth (they were able to provide extra) was so delicious and the mussels & clams were cooked to perfection. The garlic bread was amazing as well especially when dipped in the broth. One of my highlights is the house infused olive oil they serve with bread. OMG! It was divine, will have to try to make my own at home. My fiancé's pasta & meatballs were pretty standard, nothing exquisite but they got the job done. Maybe he shoulda ordered something diff? "
,,,,,Overall would definitely come back here & would love to come for dinner.
,,,,,"Our experience here was very mediocre despite all the reviews. This is coming from an unbiased foodie. The service was sub-par as our waiter seemed to hardly come check on us, and we had to ask for the complimentary bread to come out after our appetizers - the Brussels sprouts and garlic bread which were both great. We also ordered the Caesar salad with grilled chicken, and the chicken was amazing. The salad not so much unless you're a fan of salad dressing overpowering the entire dish. Our second dish was the lasagna. Although it was good, it was nothing abstract or different. The espresso cheesecake was a very nice touch to dessert. All in all, I would rate the service 4/10 and the food 7/10. It was more of an experience than not based on being Seattle's most popular restaurant."
,,,,,"I looooove this place! From the staff, to the cool effortless decor and the food!! "
,,,,,The Cioppino was fantastic but the lasagne (not pictured because we devoured it lol) might have been my favorite. The waiter was professional and friendly and the food arrived quickly. The ambiance is really nice and cozy. Perfect for a date or dinner with a friend. 
,,,,,Absolutely make a reservation! We made ours a weeks in advance and the only time slot left was for 9:30pm. Enjoy!
,,,,,"First time visiting this restaurant and Seattle, I really recommend coming here and experiencing the great food and live entertainment. Our server Sarah was very friendly and helpful, ask for Sarah! Overall great spot to visit."
,,,,,"Second time here, food was delicious and affordable. Sat in the newer dining room area, and the decor and view was awesome. Service was on point and the waiter was very friendly in explaining the specials. Friend got a salmon, and it was super tender."
,,,,,"The only dislike is that the restaurant is located in pike place, which makes parking a bit of a nightmare. But will definitely come back if in the area."
,,,,,So good! The lasagna was the best I've ever had. Also the potato gnocchi was amazing.

,,,,,"I've lived in Seattle for almost 6 years and have always thought the Pink door was overhyped. I was really hoping to be proven wrong after visiting the other night for a best friend's birthday. While the service of the staff and the ambiance of the restaurant is great, the portion of my $24 bolognese dish (literally noodles and a meat sauce) was a quarter of the size of my friend's linguini dish with clams, which was also $22! The noodles were good, but would recommend the lasagna or clams more. "
,,,,,3/5 stars because their fries w/ aioli was delicious!! big plate of fries for $11 was 100% worth!
,,,,,"I don't know what all the hype is.  Located in the Pike Place Market, the Pink Door is such a touristy restaurant.  There is nothing special about this restaurant.  In fact, I have had better Italian food at a dozen other places.  Our waiter recommended the lasagna, which is a pesto lasagna, but it tasted just like any pasta with pesto (1 star off).  We also got another popular item, the meatballs, but they were tiny and I like them even less than Costco's meatballs (1 star off).  I guess the pappardelle bolognese was decent, although it's something that many Italian restaurants do well.  Even though we had a reservation, we still had to wait awhile in line (1 star off).  I really would not recommend eating here unless you are here for the view.  The view was nice...the view always has an inverse relationship with the quality of food."
,,,,,"It was a little tricky finding the entrance to this restaurant, but the pink door gave it away...HAHA. "
,,,,,"I overheard someone say that this place has the best pasta in Seattle. Although I'm not sure about best, the pasta was really delicious!! We didn't make any reservations but the hostess told us it was going to be about an hour wait so we hung around the area. Without a doubt, the hostess was prompt at calling us right at the hour mark and sat us immediately once we got back to the restaurant."
,,,,,"We didn't have to wait forever for the food to be served. The service was A1 and so friendly! We got the clam linguine and the shrimp rissoto. I forgot to take a picture of the clam linguine but let me tell you.....the clam to linguine ratio is something I cannot complain about. Coming from California, im used to having more pasta than protein, so this was definitely impressive for me. Both dishes took me to flavor town! "
,,,,,The shrimp risotto was really rich and flavorful as well. The portions were filling and worth the prices. 
,,,,,Our server recommended us the rosé sangria that came with fresh berries and it was delicious as well! 
,,,,,The atmosphere felt very comfortable and I would definitely come here again the next time I come to Seattle to try more things!
,,,,,Excellent Italian food and 5 star service. Went with a small group of colleagues for a late lunch. Had to make reservations and wait for about an hour. We put our name in and went for a nice walk and we were not disappointed after being seated. Get the garlic fries!!!
,,,,,"The server was very nice. But the food is just ok. If you have had truly good Italian dish in your life, it will be ""meh"" level of food here. Great view though."
,,,,,"The Pink Door is finally back open!!! I was so excited to plan this Saturday's social distancing date night, my husband and I ordered take out and came straight hoke to enjoy our evening. The menu has reduced due to the temporary closure. "
,,,,,"I called ahead to place our order, it was ready within 30 minutes. I greatly appreciate the text messages to let me know the order progress."
,,,,,"Our meal was so exceptionally good, we may order from here again next Saturday. The fresh ingredients were visually evident, and not to heavy which was perfect for a beautiful, warm summer night. We will return, and highly recommend!!"
,,,,,"It is better than 5 stars. The service was impeccable. Atmosphere delightful with live music and the food and drink were incredible. We had the lasagna, potato gnocchi, and the rigatoni with meatballs. Wow. Just wow."
,,,,,"Very Disappointed..........The kale and the Caesar salad were both very good. We had the lasagna and it was what we expected, but the cioppino was a huge  disappointment. "
,,,,,The cioppino lacked flavor or any real depth that you would expect with a restaurant with a high rating like the Pink Door. 
,,,,,"I have been to PD many times over the years and it's always lived up to its reputation, but I'm very disappointed with one of their signature dishes. I actually asked for salt....first for me. "
,,,,,I would rethink going back.
,,,,,"Started with the blistered asparagus and roasted beets. For the mains, had the risotto with gulf prawns. Plenty of fun, tasty cocktails as well. Good place for a night out! Ambience is lovely and the bar + patio are beautiful."

,,,,,"I spent a few days in Seattle and since it was my first time, Yelp was instrumental in helping me find places to eat. By far, The Pink Door was my favorite restaurant! Everything I ordered was delicious! "
,,,,,I started off with the Black Lives Matter cocktail and bruschetta. The cocktail was amazing and perfect for the 70 degree and sunny weather. The bruschetta was fresh and the tomatoes were big and juicy.
,,,,,"I had the lasagna as the entree, and while I'm sure everything else on their menu is excellent--the lasagna is where it is! I finished the entire dish. For me, I usually just order an entree, but even with the appetizer to start and two cocktails, my meal wasn't heavy! "
,,,,,"You need a reservation. I went on a Thursday at 1:45 pm with no issue. You will need to wear your mask anytime your server is at your table. Didn't bother me; in fact, I'd probably dine out more if more establishments implemented this practice."
,,,,,Recommend by a friend and accidentally stumbled upon it. It does have a link door and located in an alley. Super cute atmosphere almost like a secret club or something. Service was superb and food was delicious. We got the stuffed meatball paninis and I can't remember what my friends got but we ate everything on our plates. The panini can be shared unless your super hungry. 
,,,,,Definite recommend!
,,,,,"Got a reservation (Finally) and what a vibe!! There was a live music area, a place with spectacular view and the server was super friendly, and helped us choose the best from the menu. After our entrées, I blindly trusted the server's suggestion for the dessert and was not disappointed at all. The dessert ( butterscotch rum something) was so delicious with right level of sweetness. I had a great time and happy we chose this place for our small celebration."
,,,,,"Amazing menu, everything was so delicious. Wonderful atmosphere inside and great service. Live music, lively vibe, high quality."
,,,,,"I've been visiting Pink Door for several years and have always had a good experience. The staff are friendly, the bartenders mix some tasty cocktails, and the food is delicious. I love that they have a nice-sized outdoor patio with some shade to enjoy during the summer. "
,,,,,"Some of my favorite food items include the various pastas, the meatballs, and the Caesar salad. One time I ate a butterscotch pudding for dessert that I still dream about! I appreciate the rotating cocktail menu as well. "
,,,,,"Of note is that Pink Door is a popular location so be sure to make a reservation. Because COVID has slowed down dining out, you may be fortunate enough to snag a reservation for the same day. Use the OpenTable app to identify table availability and make the process easy."
,,,,,"Always wonderful, and never disappointing. "
,,,,,"The food was delicious, staff was friendly, service was good. It was my partner's birthday-and I believe they confused our table with another party. On our way out, I mentioned it to the staff, and they were deeply apologetic and asked us to wait. They brought out a complimentary birthday dessert in a ""to go"" container for us to share later that evening. So thoughtful! We will be back'"
,,,,,"Pink door is a Seattle classic with incredible dining, drinks, and ambiance. During our visit, the staff was incredibly friendly, attentive, and accommodating to our whole party. The food itself was absolutely stellar- possibly the best lasagna I've EVER eaten and the salmon was cooked to perfection. Can't wait to go back and hopefully catch one of the performances held inside the restaurant!"
,,,,,Arancini and antipasto were good as well as the Cesar Salad!  Budino was excellent for dessert!
,,,,,Live entertainment was fun! Great last night in Seattle!
,,,,,"Glad we didn't have to wait to get a table here. Very courteous staff and beautiful view overlooking pikes place. It was a Sunday so even the farmers market was in full bloom. Had the Chardonnay(the best one I had so far), risotto and ravioli. Creme brûlée was an exception delight. This is a good place for vegetarians give they had ample options for it."
,,,,,Definitely coming back for Chardonnay and creme brûlée.
,,,,,"You cannot pass this place up. I've been coming here for 30 years. The view from the deck is still extraordinary as is this lovely laveder parfait amor martini. Lasagna, great company, beautiful city. Listening to live jazz and indulging. Hidden pink door off Post Alley adds to the adventure. I tried making a reservation for weeks but couldn't get one. We just walked up at 7:30 and were able to be seated in the bar area with a view to the outside so don't give up. It's the Seattle experience."
,,,,,"i have loved this place for so many years.  i go back on each visit to seattle.  the food is good, the cocktails fine and the view from the outdoor patio is of the waterfront and perfect.  this time, i was in seattle solo and after walking much of the city, decided to get a late afternoon cocktail and something small to tide me over.  there was the perfect seat on the deck so i could see the water, i had a parfait d'amour martini (beautiful lavender color and with a hint of orange) and spicy sautéed calamri served with a wonderful, warm, crusty bread.  it was perfect!  the pink door is a hidden gem approached from post alley just across from keel's - if you don't know it's there, you'd never stumble across it - one of it special features!"

,,,,,"This cozy Italian restaurant is tucked in an alley way near Pike Market right across from a wine tasting bar. We were lucky enough to get a walk-in table relatively quickly on a Wednesday evening (about 15 min wait after putting our names in on a Wed night at 630pm). When you enter you go downstairs into the restaurant where I was pleasantly surprised to find a jazz band on stage in the corner of the establishment. Our party started off with the Tuscan Fries and order of Meatballs. The fries were a must have, fragrant with garlic and rosemary and served with a delicious dip. Meatballs were solid and perfect for dredging their bread with flavorful olive oil through the remaining sauce to savor. My dining mates both had their Lasagna from having dined there before and loving it (one of them said it's hands down their fave lasagna). I went with their Squid Ink Pasta with Prawns and it was a garlicky delight. I scooped up every last bite and could have overstuffed myself with more. All in all a delicious first visit to The Pink Door. However, I would be remiss not to mention the only reason they did not get the full five stars is due to the waiter who was very short and sour-faced, when we were trying to be friendly and having a great time. When I didn't know which wine I wanted to accompany my meal yet, he snapped his heels to whip around dramatically and walk away in disgust from our table. On the times that he checked in how things were tasting, it was rather obvious to be an obligation and barely waited for a response before walking away again. We just made the best of the meal though and didn't pay mind to the cold service. Look forward to dining here again!"

,,,,,"There's so many raving reviews at Pink Door and there's a reason... The service and our dinner were excellent. Alissa, our server is the best. She's friendly, attentive and service with a smile. She made our dining experience unforgettable. "
,,,,,"The food was fabulous. We started with the Salami Cheese charcuterie and fresh red and yellow Beet Salad, two great starters. For dinner, we selected Beef Short Ribs braised in Chianti w/ soft polenta and linguine alle vongole. There were more clams than linguine, both coming out piping hot. The meal was divine."
,,,,,"With the perfect lighting and sound, it created a nice ambience. Their playlist was over the top, we enjoyed listening to all-time classics.  Book your reservation, it's worth it."
,,,,,"I dont offer 5 stars often but this place was just great. Only regret was not having more dishes to try. We were food crawling all day so had to save room. We had the mussels and clams, those were tasty and no grit whatsoever. The caesar salad was so fresh and cold and then used whole butter lettuce leaves, mmm. And best of all 2as the brread and olive oil, dont know what it was but man that was good. Service was A+. Really cool place, reminded me of a mix btw New Orleans and Charleston. Big fan."
,,,,,I hope we go back for more dishes one day. You wont be disappointed. Cheers
,,,,,To all the Seattle transplants: I tried the super-famous TPD so you don't have to.
,,,,,"If there was a bingo sheet for ""Becoming a Seattleite,"" then dining at TPD would definitely be on the there. I was so excited to check off one of THE most popular, most reviewed restos in all of the Emerald City. We came here for my bff's birthday, finally!!"
,,,,,"I'd say you'll get exactly what you're expecting, but not what you're actually paying for..."
,,,,,"What I mean is, we got Linguine alla Vongole and Lasagna to share, and they were delicious; however, I felt that the price tag was quite steep for something I could easily attempt to replicate at home. The food was good but nothing that wow'ed me. You're paying for the experience and ambiance which felt both elevated and comfortable. There are definitely some hits and misses on the menu, so check the Yelp photos and reviews for accurate portion sizes (looking at you, tiny Bolognese pasta.)"
,,,,,"If you're interested in a fancier Italian dinner right in the heart of Pike's, then come right on down. If you're looking for a better tasting meal, better prices, or just something that isn't overhyped; then feel very free to skip."
,,,,,Corona Virus Safe. They sanitize and space you out. You eat outside in deck. 
,,,,,Service/atmosphere:
,,,,,This place is cute and servers are very well trained and kind. Must wear a mask at all times when confronted with a server but are allowed to take it off once they leave.
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,Fish was 5/5 so yummmmy $30
,,,,,"Crab risotto 1/5 they probably put two spoon full of VERY THINLY slicked crab on top and A LOT of cheap frozen corn. I wish I sent it back for what we paid. Did not meet expectations for such a ""luxurious"" spot."
,,,,,Lasagna was 3/5 friends liked it but said it was just basic and nothing special for the price tag
,,,,,Clam Linguine 5/5 noodles were perfectly cooked and marinated with clam juice and very generous amount of clams if only they did the same for the crab risotto dish
,,,,,Drinks:
,,,,,BLM is 5/5! So glad they have this on the menu and they donate $1 too
,,,,,I'd probably come back.
,,,,,"Also ordered the cioppino pink door, but thought it was quite blend and not too good. The complimentary sour dough bread was good, but was cold. The mussels and clams was decent, and the garlic bread that came with it was really well made. The house special for the day was amazing. "
,,,,,Food: 7/10
,,,,,Service: 10/10
,,,,,Ambience: 9/10
,,,,,The pink door exceeded our expectations! It's a little tricky to find- but once you find the alley it's not too hard to figure out. We got a really nice booth with a view. Their covid precautions are great- we felt super safe and you can tell their doing everything they can to keep their staff safe.
,,,,,We had the Bolognese and Linguine Alle Vongole. The linguine came with so many clams- I was really impressed. The Bolognese stole the show though. It was one of the best Bolognese we've ever had! Highly recommend.
,,,,,"If I could give this place double the stars, I totally would."
,,,,,"In town for the weekend celebrating our anniversary, my boyfriend and I had The Pink Door on our list as a top place to eat. "
,,,,,Seating and Ambiance: We were able to get seated inside and the ambiance just already sets you in the most beautiful and peaceful mood with overlooking the water and the Ferris Wheel. Big windows with so much natural light coming in and comfy booth to enjoy good company and food. 
,,,,,"Service: Greta was our server and she honestly made our dining experience one to remember, exceeded our expectations and was just so hospitable. I always believe that service can really make or break a place even with having amazing food. She gave us the update on the specials, not listed in the menu, really cared about our preference of food and drinks and checked in to make sure we were all good during the whole dining experience. She's an A+ and we really appreciated her kind service."
,,,,,"Food: we started off with the Ahi Tuna Crudo. AMAZING. So good I could probably eat the whole plate myself but of course, sharing is caring! It ago tuna was very fresh and melts as soon as you take a bite and has a very well flavor balance of micro greens and the orange citrus vinaigrette for sauce. I'm not a big capers fan but this dish changed it as they perfectly fried the capers to give you a crunch without a powering salty taste. This dish was excellent."
,,,,,Next course was the Little Gems Caesar Salad. A very nice portion and definitely something to share. We had it with the Dungeness crab and was really refreshing. Filled our tummies but we were ready for the next course!
,,,,,Lastly we had the special of the day which was the fresh fish. I never ever finish my meals and always end up sharing and getting full so fast but this dish was superb. It was sitting in a very light tomato broth with some potatoes and topped with leek flowers that gave it an incredible balance with all the ingredients on the plate. Beautifully colorful and oh so tasty! 
,,,,,"Overall 100% one of the best dining experiences with having every dish be exquisite in its on way, greatly timed with each dish to be prepared and brought to the table. Great ambiance with the best service."
,,,,,Highly recommend checking this place out for brunch and will definitely be back!
,,,,,"Thanks so much The Pink Door, we left Seattle full and overly satisfied!"
,,,,,"My fourth or fifth visit over the years, in the past I'd have given five stars but this time four. Twenty years makes for more comparisons, I guess. This was the first time I  dined in their outdoor area. Birds flitted in and out among the many hanging baskets of flowers. Everything beautiful, inside and out. Service great, but it's  jarring when every sip of water results in a frantic refill. I could practically hear a supervisor in the background saying, ""Top off those water glasses! Hurry! I don't  want to see any  unfilled glasses!"" Or maybe that's my own post server stress response from all those many years ago. The staff are mostly covered with ink and piercings, melding with the whole rococo mood."
,,,,,"They were out of crab, so crab caesar was out. Clam linguine was out, as the chefs noticed the clams were sandy. Nice catch. So I settled on the wide pasta with meat sauce. It was a delicious  comfort food. Bruschetta was amazing. The kid decided to try something new; I guess age 20 is when some picky eaters begin to branch out. He tried the squid ink spaghetti. I warned him that squid ink has its own unique flavor but he insisted. He actually ate it but said it was too spicy. I tasted it, the spice was nice hot garlic, overcoming the nightmare-like squid ink flavor. Yuck! No squid ink for me! But I digress."

,,,,,"Atmosphere is over the top! Started with cocktails at 5 pm didn't leave until 9! Bartender created cocktails to suit the mood and time with local liquors and nice herbs. Decor quirky. Food oysters, meatballs,and tortellini in a beautiful broth. Espresso was rich dark and robust and we finished with a flavorful pan a cotta .  It's a speakeasy of an Italian restaurant a true gem. Entertainment on some nights alway unique. Run don't walk to the pink door in the alley"
,,,,,"I came here for Halloween and ordered the  papardelle al Ragu Bolognese, risotto, and alancini. All of the food was amazing! I honestly wouldn't change anything. We also had a beautiful view of the pier and the Ferris wheel. Everyone should try this restaurant at least once. We will definitely be back."
,,,,,Let me first start by saying I made a reservation well in advance because of the great reviews.
,,,,,"We were not at all impressed by this place or with their food. There was a ton of flies indoors making the dinning experience distasteful. Another thing that bothered me is that my tea cup was given to me with someone else's lipstick on it (I had none on). The waitress was nice and apologetic but this obviously was an issue for me (especially during a pandemic). Lastly, they don't clean the tables. Ours was dirty upon being seated. I didn't want to complain, so I excused it and avoided parts of the table, but I shouldn't have to do that at a restaurant with such high ratings.  Friends who are traveling to Seattle have asked my opinion on the place, and sadly I am not able to recommend it to any of them."
,,,,,"Although my husband and I had a great experience dining here especially when it was our anniversary, I think the food here is a bit overrated. We loved the two antipasti we ordered: the garlic bread and ahi tuna crudo. They had great presentations and flavors. However, we were disappointed with the popular dish of squid ink spaghetti. It was a bit salty and dry for our taste. We also ordered the grilled broccolini as a side dish and it was also too salty and the broccolini didn't seem very fresh. Being that said, the staff was really friendly and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful and romantic with lots of interesting decorations. I'll probably come next time to grab a drink when they have live music performance, just to enjoy the atmosphere."
,,,,,"As always, it was very busy but they were able to get us in for dinner in a timely manner. The staff are very nice, the food was delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful! We love Pink door and want to come back and sit outdoor for lunch sometime. We will be back and recommend this place!"
,,,,,Excellent mussels and clam lunch today!
,,,,,"Service was friendly, Covid conscious (masks until seated and then required during server visit), and altogether very special. I would recommend advance reservations due to reduced capacity, but give it a try if you are wandering around Pike Place Market. We got in without them but beat the lunch rush. "
,,,,,"Beautiful view, excellent food and service."
,,,,,10/10 loved everything about this place! Service was great with our waitress making sure everything was ok for us! 
,,,,,The seasonal mock tail was a watermelon rosemary mix but I added alcohol and it wasted amazing! Desert was light without being too creamy or thick! 
,,,,,"Reservations can be made online, walk in might be difficult depending what time you go!"
,,,,,"I went here for my last homecoming and the service and food were both very good. They passed no judgment because of us being high schoolers, they treated us as any paying customer. Coming to pink door was a very special experience. I'd take a special someone here."
,,,,,Amazing atmosphere and the food was phenomenal! I highly recommend the pink door lasagna. Perfect for date night with unique vibe and live music.
,,,,,"Hidden off of post alley, we almost walked right past it. There's no sign so make sure you are looking. The inside atmosphere is circus themed and so cool! You do have to put your mask on every time the waiter comes over but they try to give you space. "
,,,,,The staff is friendly and the music was good. 
,,,,,They offer a large menu full of Italian style seafood! 
,,,,,"The drink menu has a variety of cocktails, beers, and wines. You can get a half bottle of wine which is about two and a half glasses, so the perfect personal size LOL! "
,,,,,The linguine was AMAZING and the fish of the day (rock fish) was flavorful.
,,,,,"Ask for them to bring you house bread, it's free! They don't offer it tho!"
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Omg! If you haven't been to the Pink door, make a reservation today! Over 15 yrs in Seattle and still love love love this place! Most recently I went here for a solo lunch. Got a table out on their beautiful patio and cherished  every moment- perfect day, birds chirping, lots of people/laughs. "
,,,,,"I got the Sbagliato Spritz (one of their summer cocktails) and my favorite the Lasagna Pink Door, plus the house bread of course. Everything was 10/10. Can't wait to return."
,,,,,"For the most talked about and consistently well reviewed restaurant in Post Alley (and probably Seattle), it's a wonder I haven't made it here until recently. Well, guess it isn't a huge mystery why, they're always booked!"
,,,,,"On a whim and on a post-lunch hour sunny(!?) November day, I decided to walk by the Alley to see if they happen to have any space for walk ins, and it was my lucky day!"
,,,,,"I got seated at the high tops near the back with fantastic views of the Sound. But what was better were the half dozen Kushi oysters I ordered to start. I'm usually of the opinion that oysters are fantastic anywhere in the PNW, since they all come from the same few farms anyways - as long as they're fresh, not much work is needed to serve them, just need to shuck 'em and wow me a bit with the mignonette I guess. However, I can't help but notice and commend how well and meticulously the oysters were shucked - not a single bit of shell was found and the oysters did not need one iota of encouragement from any utensils to slide right into my waiting mouth. The accompanying balsamic ice also had no trouble wowing me. PNW oysters don't need much help to shine, but the Pink Door definitely pushed them over the top."
,,,,,"For the main, I had the linguine alle vongole, which is every bit as good everyone says it is, including my waiter. There was about equal parts clams and linguine and a satisfying volume of delicious, buttery, lemony, and clammy goodness waiting for me at the bottom of the plate. There was zero hesitation from me when the waiter offered freshly baked bread to sop it up."
,,,,,Hopefully I can find my way back here somehow.
,,,,,"The Pink Door is a hidden gem in Seattle. Apparently it's only well known to locals, but if you are ever in Seattle, you have got to try the Pink door. The Pink Door is a hidden restaurant on Post Alley near the Public Market. All you see from the outside is a pink door. Once you step inside, that's where the magic is. "
,,,,,You're greeting by walking down the stairs and the first thing you encounter is a magical dining room with very nice decor and decorations. It's definitely a date night place if you want a place to impress. During the non-COVID they have live music. 
,,,,,This place is reservation only. You cannot walk in and request a table. I'm not sure if it was like that pre-COVID Era. 
,,,,,"The menu has a huge variety ranging from Anti Pasta, Pasta, Seafood, etc. I ordered like five different entrees as I wanted to try everything. The pricing is incredibly fair compared to the quality and food you get."
,,,,,"For example, the Clam Linguine has a boat load of clams! Definitely get your money's worth. The other dishes are great as well. Everything here tastes awesome. I only wish I had a larger stomach to devour more delicious food from this place."
,,,,,"There is no mandatory service charge, but you'll tip great because the food is amazing and the service is great as well. They come by and check often and replaced my drink often. I ordered a lemonade here and it tasted good, apparently it's freshly made to order so there is no refill. "
,,,,,"The parking for this place isn't difficult as you can find street parking or park at the plaza near by, I parked on the street as it's free after 8 PM. "
,,,,,Remember to not miss your reservation or they will charge you a fee of like 25 dollars or something. 
,,,,,Unfortunately at the time of this review it was the last day of dine in service in Seattle. 
,,,,,Highly recommend coming to check this place out in person the next time dine in service is back! 5/5 FOR SURE! Great place for sure.
,,,,,"I came here for lunch after seeing all the great reviews. This place's entrance is kind of hidden in the alley. I made reservations and was sat as soon as I arrived. I ordered their popular Linguine Alle Vongole which totally lived up to its hype. The noodles were nicely seasoned with garlic and I got an abundance of clams in my pasta. I also ordered the Pink Door Mocktail which was so-so. I was glad to sit outside on their patio but the views weren't anything to look at. Overall, I nice sit down lunch amongst all the hustle and bustle Seattle's downtown has to offer."
,,,,,"Pink door is one of the best food places I have been to in Seattle. The seafood tasted fresh, the pasta was the right type of chewiness and the bread was really fragrant."
,,,,,"The spaghetti pescatore wasn't on the menu but it was able to be ordered if asked! The spicy marinara had a small kick that just elevated the taste of chilis rather than the pain of spice. The medley of seafood in it was great with variety - mussels, clams, shrimp and octopus - and the pasta was truly different from regular pasta m, a dash more deep."
,,,,,The penn cove was a classic as a delicious white wine based sauce with mussels and bread. It was very creamy but not too light as well. I recommend this for a shareable plate except for the garlic bread on top. 
,,,,,The wait staff was also extremely kind and sociable.
,,,,,"Honestly, it was a 10/10 experience."
,,,,,"Everyone knows The Pink Door has incredible Italian food, but a little know secret is that they also have the BEST espresso martinis. Without a doubt. We watched them being made with real espresso, instead of coffee flavored liqueur. Paired with the most romantic ambiance, and we couldn't be happier!"
,,,,,"Love the Pink Door! I've been coming here for years, and this restaurant is as good as ever. They have live music, and the inside is very romantic - perfect for dates!"
,,,,,"We walked in and they said it was an hour wait. But saw there was a opening on the online reservation, so we got seated within 15-20 mins. We ordered the bolognese, crab salad, linguine alle vongolle, ciopinno, rosehips to the lips and a melon drink. The bolognese was my favorite. It was so delicious, I wished the portion was bigger. The waiter thought it was a lot of food for us but we managed to finish it all. The ambiance was so romantic. Will be back again before we head back home !"
,,,,,We went here today memorial weekend. They were fully booked I definitely recommend making a reservation on OpenTable if you went. Seating is mostly outdoor and some people were seated inside.
,,,,,I think Pink door is over hyped and you are playing more for the atmosphere of being above the Pike market place area.
,,,,,We ordered the linguine alle vongole aka the white wine clam pancetta pasta which was okay but I'm not a fan when a popular Italian place uses prepackage pasta. It just didn't have the beautiful bite of a fresh made pasta.
,,,,,The pink door lasagna was better since it was a fresh spinach pasta with pesto topped with marinara sauce. It was a smaller size portion perfect for lunch. I just wish they made their linguine fresh if they made the lasagna noodles.
,,,,,I feel like there's are so many better Italian places that make their pasta fresh. I would only go here if you want to eat in the Pike place area I wouldn't go here if I was craving a really good pasta dish.

,,,,,"Had the best time here and the food was delish. I highly recommend you give it a go whenever you are in Seattle! The atmosphere, people, drinks and food- I cannot rave enough. Really fun spot for a date or anniversary"
,,,,,"This place is hands-down my favorite place for Italian food and my favorite place to take people when they come to visit. It's not easy to get a reservation but try giving them a call and I'm sure they'll be able to find a place for you, or you could walk up. I really love the lasagna and the Bolognese. The olive oil they serve with the bread as an appetizer is also so delicious and you can buy it to go!"
,,,,,I've been here as a treat a few times now and I always love the Bolognase! My boyfriend ordered the lasagna last time and it was AMAZING. Views from the back dining room are gorgeous. Service is great. This is my favorite place for fresh Italian food in Seattle.
,,,,,"Finally get to try The Pink Door! Last time I was in Seattle, I couldn't even get a reservation. Thanks to COVID, I was able to get one during lunch time this time around."
,,,,,"We went on a gorgeous day and outdoor seating was very nice. We ordered the kale salad to share (coz we're trying to be healthy), I got the linguini and my friend got the pesto lasagna. The linguini was good, there were so many clams and each of them are huge! However, I think the star of the show was the lasagna. It was super creamy and with the pesto, which I love! Definitely not your typical lasagna dish. For dessert, we got the panna cotta share, it was also pretty amazing. There were other many good options, but we were just too full at the end to get more."
,,,,,"Would definitely be coming back again when I'm in town, especially because their menus changes every few months!"
,,,,,Ate here on a Thursday night and ordered the flank steak and squid ink noodles. My partner ordered  the noodles and had food posion 4 hours later ): The flank steak was just okay. 
,,,,,It makes me really sad. Here is my $75 donation to you.
,,,,,"Brought my mom here for Mother's Day. The food was so good and light. I wasn't overstuffed! Just right. Our waitress was super sweet and friendly. We also had a basil cake, I wish I had taken a picture of it! That was my favorite part of the lunch. That cake was so freaking good! Never thought of basil in a cake but it was so refreshing and light!"
,,,,,"It's been 2 years since our last visit! We started coming for my birthday but bc covid last year nothing was really open. The wait was with it tho! The food was so so amazing tonight and everyone was asking me about my birthday. I felt so special and was so happy they honored my request to sit by a window - thank you! We got so much food- the herb fries, garlic bread, asparagus, lasagna & bucatini! Everything was delicious!"
,,,,,We were able to get in without a reservation for our group of 4 by coming in right at 5pm. We only had to wait 15 mins and then we're seated.
,,,,,Everything was incredible & we were able to see a cool show on a Sunday evening
,,,,,"This could have been a 4 star review had it not been for the endless wait. The waiter made it less painful by being very personable, so I don't mind coming back if ever I visit Seattle again. "
,,,,,The food was good and service was excellent-but for the wait.
,,,,,"The restaurant has a great ambiance, but the food is not mind-blowing. I had the seafood pasta and was not that impressed."

,,,,,"Just earlier this week, I visited Seattle with friends and was so excited to try the famed Pink Door restaurant! That was until I experienced the startling bad service and surprisingly less than average food."
,,,,,"When we first found the entrance to the restaurant, we were in awe of the gorgeous and elegant ambience, it was literally like we were transported to someplace else. We thought to ourselves, if this view and the restaurant looked THIS good, imagine how great everything else would be? We were sadly mistaken LOL. "
,,,,,"The waiter came to greet us and immediately notified us that the most popular entree, the Linguine Alle Vongole, was no longer available for the night. We were a bit disappointed, but most of my group decided to change out the linguini for rigatoni, which is basically still the same dish but with rigatoni noodles instead. We also ordered the Tuscan fries to share, oysters, and an order of Lasagna and Pappardelle Bolognese for the rest of my friends."
,,,,,"The waiter seemed throughly confused and looked almost mad when we placed our orders for the Alle Vongole. His entire demeanor changed from friendly to seemingly very annoyed of us. My entire group all noticed how weird the encounter was, but we decided to brush it off. The waiter brought out the appetizers shortly after, where I then asked to order the Justice for George Floyd cocktail - which was okay."
,,,,,"The waiter stared daggers at me for a couple seconds when I asked to order a drink and then promptly said ""sure"" afterwards, as if I had done something to insult him LOL. The service was definitely more off putting than ever, creating an uncomfortable and unsatisfactory experience for my group the rest of the meal. We were actually holding back from asking him for anything else, just to avoid any more encounters with him! Every time he came to check on us, he seemed to be holding his breath and mustered up the courage to only give short and simple responses... "
,,,,,"When the food came out though, we still had high hopes. The Tuscan fries were delicious, and my friends did enjoy the bolognese and lasagna. Unfortunately, the ""best"" dish on their menu, the Alle Vongole that I had ordered, was less than mediocre, to say the least. Maybe it was because we opted to get rigatoni instead, since there was no more linguini noodles left. The portions were embarrassingly small, and there was barely any flavor to the dish. My friends and I left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry LOL."
,,,,,"In all, the ambience and overall atmosphere of Pink Door is sooo elegant and classy, definitely my favorite thing about the restaurant! But the food, portions, and service is what killed the experience for me. Wasn't worth the money tbh."
,,,,,We have visited this place multiple times over last 7-8 years.
,,,,,"Our favorite and only dish we have here is the ""Lasagna Pink Door"" - It's vegetarian and it's the best lasagna we have had in all those years!!"
,,,,,Good cocktails and entertainment on Fridays/weekends is just the icing on the cake.
,,,,,Quite a few of my friends have declared The Pink Door their favorite restaurant in Seattle so it's been on the top of my list of spots to try for a while. Was super excited to dine in on my visit to Seattle during Memorial Day Weekend. Didn't get a chance to make reservations in advance but we were able to put our name on the waitlist - they quoted us an hour and half wait time but we ended up getting seated within the hour.
,,,,,"Absolutely adored the homey yet upscale vibes. We were seated by the window and had views of Pikes Place. Our server was spectacular - she was super friendly, attentive, and gave us some awesome recommendations especially with the wine we paired with our meal! Wish I got her name to give her a shout out because it really made the experience that much better!"
,,,,,"To kick off the meal we got some bread and olive oil. (I told my boyfriend I could probably write a paragraph on this alone so here goes.) Bread and olive oil is your standard Italian restaurant appetizer - I honestly think it generally tastes so good because of the anticipation of the big meal. So I will say, maybe this bread and olive oil tasted particularly fantastic because of how hangry I was but I will say, there was something particularly spectacular about this house infused olive oil. On it's own, it was pretty tasty but the bread really brought out some of the citrusy notes - talk about levels and depths of flavor. Okay, enough on the olive oil - point made."
,,,,,"Started off with the everything green salad - loved how light and refreshing the creamy avocado dressing was. For main dishes we shared the linguine alla vongolle, the cioppino pink door, and the special of the night which was a gnocchi with a sage butter sauce. Everything was spectacular. Loved how much seafood was in the cioppino and the linguine - could barely see the noodles in the linguine."
,,,,,Overall a stellar experience and thought it was the perfect spot for a romantic last night of the trip! Would come back again.
,,,,,"Seriously loved everything about this place! We wandered in at lunch. They were completely full, but we promised to eat quickly, lol, and they were able to get us in between reservations. The service was so, so good...friendly and not pretentious at all. I had the short ribs/polenta dish, and it was to die for! My husband had an amazing fish of the day. The decor is SO fun/quirky/delightful, and yeah, just a great, great experience!"
,,,,,We came in at 9:30 pm on a Wednesday night and was luckily able to get a table right away with no reservation. We tried to book a reservation online but it was booked out all month! 
,,,,,This is a great place to go for a nice and romantic dinner since the inside is beautiful. There was live music playing on stage. 
,,,,,"We ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole which had great flavor. The clams and pasta went amazing together and was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Lasagna Pink Door and it was surprising how good it was. I usually don't like lasagna but their dish was really good. For dessert, we ordered the trio of gelato and it came with a cookie as well. Definitely enjoyed this dinner and service was great as well. We asked for the gelato to go and she let us pay first before packaging up the gelato to make sure it doesn't melt as fast!"
,,,,,The food is impeccable and the staff is wonderful... our waitress Ashley is adorable and such a sweet person... please come and ask for her!!! This is the best food I have ever eaten.
,,,,,"The first night in Seattle we decided to have dinner here. First off, it was so difficult to get reservations! We reserved a 9pm reservation, called the restaurant and they said we could come in as they reserve half off of the restaurant is available for walk ins but we will need our vaccination cards or a picture of it. It was nice to see how strict they were with COVID. We were lucky enough to get in an hour early. The restaurant itself is a different vibe but it was a highly reviewed restaurant. We started with Tuna Crudo, very citrusy and fresh. Also, got the garlic bread to share which was a good one for the table. But as we sat around waiting for our food we realized almost every other table was given house bread except for us.. I think our server forgot so she brought it by while we were having dinner. But if we had known we would have chosen another appetizer. My sister and I shared Caesar Salad and Penne Al Fumo. It was a vegetarian pasta, full of flavor and enough for the both of us plus the salad. It was a good experience, not a must try but a nice dinner!"
,,,,,Loved the Pink Door.  The food was amazing.  I had the lasagne.  Yummy.  Bread was delicious too.  Nice cocktails and great service
,,,,,"The service is pretty good, way tooo crowded with covid going around on weekends. So be prepared to sit next to strangers with minimal social distancing. The hosts at the door will ask for proof of vaccination but won't ask everyone for drivers license."
,,,,,"Some Blonds & white people  didn't have to take out license but I did,"
,,,,,Kinda strange if you ask me.
,,,,,Food is pretty good as always
,,,,,We stopped by here for an impromptu dinner and made it in the walk-in waiting line. Luckily it was only about a 30 min wait before we were able to sit down. We ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole and the Lasagna Pink Door and both were amazing! Super flavorful! There was also live music that started at 7pm. Would highly recommend this spot and recommend making a reservation beforehand if you know you're going to go :)
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Cute spot for a date or a girly lunch/dinner.
,,,,,"Atmosphere is super cute, indoor is a classic diner style and outside has light bulbs dangling with floral table cloths."
,,,,,"Highly recommend making a reservation wayy in advance, my BF and I couldn't get reservations for dinner so opted for lunch instead."
,,,,,"Pretty busy since its located in Pike, def a top tourist spot."
,,,,,"For drinks we got a half carafe of house red wine ($32), for mains we split the Ciopinno ($27) and Potato Gnocci ($22), for dessert Trio of Gelato ($10) and Antico Amaro Noveis dessert wine ($11)."
,,,,,"Complimentary bread basket comes with the meal, which was hearty and goes well with the olive oil."
,,,,,"Service was a bit slow, timing for the drinks+food was a little off since the food came right after the drinks."
,,,,,"The red wine is a great deal, perfect amount for 2 people, rich in flavor and not watered down at all."
,,,,,"Ciopinno was fresh, with clams, squid, shrimp, rockfish, and mussels."
,,,,,"Tomato wine broth was super light and not overly salty, wish it was a little spicier."
,,,,,"Gnocci was fluffy and had good earthy flavor from the mushrooms, love how the dish was light with snap peas."
,,,,,"Ice cream was super creamy, came with huge scoops of vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate with a snickerdoodle cookie on the side."
,,,,,"Dessert wine was flavorful, strong with earthy/sweet flavor."
,,,,,Great dishes with amazing vibe~
,,,,,Would def recommend stopping by here for an italian meal craving in seattle.
,,,,,"I had been to The Pink Door yearsss ago for a family birthday dinner (I ordered the salmon ha) and finally dined at the ""famous"" establishment again for my bestie's bachelorette linner in June. We made a reservation for 5 people at 3:30 on a Saturday, and enjoyed the filtered sunlight on the semi poppin' patio. "
,,,,,"For drinks I was tempted to order a glass of bubbles but am so glad I went with something a bit more festive and flavorful, a fresh strawberry vodka concoction served up. The drink was fruity but not too sweet... basically perfect for an afternoon drink on a warm day! "
,,,,,"They don't have many plant-based options so I opted for the seasonal fresh greens with green goddess dressing, asparagus and pistachios? Or something like that anyway! It was fresh, light and just what the doctor ordered. I had a handful of the fries with herbs and those were decent, although not the best fries I've had. We bugged our waiter plus the wait staff for some bread a few times and finally received a basket of free carbs. It was also decent but not spectacular. "
,,,,,"Our waiter was friendly, no complaints there! "
,,,,,"Overall it was a pleasant experience (not cheap by any means), although it would be nice if they had a solid plant-based option."
,,,,,"I was really raving about this place during and afterwards!! I can't remember the last time I liked a restaurant so much lol. First and foremost, make reservations if you can (do so as early as possible, you likely won't find any opening if you're booking within the same week). If you can't, line up before opening time. We lined up on a Friday around 4:45pm and by then we were the 5th or 6th party in line. Luckily we were able to be seated right at opening at 5pm. Decor, atmosphere, lighting, service, food, entertainment--all great in my opinion. I would describe the decor as classy vintage circus. Despite the vintage look, everything felt clean. Slightly creepy dollhouse vibes, but I was into it. It's not for everyone, but I loved it. "
,,,,,I feel like you can't go wrong with the food. 
,,,,,We ordered:
,,,,,"Tuscan fries--the chef informed us that the herbs on top are not just garnish but edible. Very crispy fries; not a single soggy one was found! May be a bit slightly over-salted and dry. Made me grab the water. Would be great to share amongst a group of people, but for two it's a bit much. But hey you'll have leftovers ;)"
,,,,,"Squid ink pasta--whoa, flavor explosion. Slightly spicy and quite lemon-y. Shrimp was juicy and cooked just right. Everything paired well together. Cauliflower did soak up a lot of the lemon juice though. "
,,,,,"Pink door lasagna (spinach lasagna)--so simple yet so delicious. If you like cheese, definitely get this."
,,,,,"Basil cake--one word: moist. So good! Who thought of putting Basil in cake? Works SO well. Got it with a candle for my friend's birthday! The fact that we left behind some on the plate made me sad. I usually don't leave leftovers and take them to-go, but we were so full by the end of our meal. I'll miss that piece of leftover cake...until next time!"
,,,,,"Customer service was great; they really care about customer satisfaction! Our waitress was Jacqueline B. (that's what the receipt says, hope it's accurate). She was really sweet and couldn't have provided better service. Every night there is a live performance. Check out their schedule and a list of performers on their website. Sundays are for aerial performances! For us, it was a jazz band called The Kleins. Since we got there at 5pm we finished our meal before the band was set to come on at 7pm. I asked if we could stay sinc we had such a great spot. Unfortunately we couldn't (they have reservations to fulfill and the place is popular in general), but was offered to watch from this spot in the back. We only stayed to enjoy about 10 minutes of the show as we had other plans anyways, but the fact that they offered that option and to have drinks up there was really nice! Will definitely be back if I'm in the city again."
,,,,,"Needed a lunch spot when I was in Seattle on business in early September.  The Pink Door came up as the highest-rated place near us, it did not disappoint.  They have a great outdoor space with harbor views and a nice fresh menu with lots of local, fresh, seasonal ingredients. "
,,,,,"We sat outside on a great sunny day, I had a tomato burrata crusti that was perfect, followed by shelfshish pasta. it was an excellent lunch."
,,,,,Five stars is not enough for this place. Pure perfection.
,,,,,First...They take the Covid precautions very seriously. All staff are vaccinated and guests must provide proof of vaccination before you can enter. And they will check your documents thoroughly. They have an outdoor patio which is huge and beautiful. It's probably the safest place in Seattle to have a delicious dinner.
,,,,,"Ryan was my server.  Having been in the restaurant business for over ten years, I know an amazing server when I am fortunate enough to get one.  He was helpful, attentive and his recommendations were dead on."
,,,,,I've had dinner all over the world and this place is one of the best.  I only wished I had tried more and had taken more pictures.  I started with the roasted figs.  They were roasted to perfection--and not too sweet.  The bread is AMAZING.  The only problem I had with it is that I wanted more--but didn't want to ruin the rest of my meal.  The clams and mussels w/garlic toast was devine.  AND...I topped it off with a raspberry basil cake!  This was one of Ryan's recommendations and it was incredible!
,,,,,"I'm not sure how it happened, but I was able to get a reservation (solo diner) on Open Table a couple of hours before they opened.  I'm guessing there was a cancellation because many people waited months because they were booked out.  (WORTH IT...WAIT!  DO IT!). I ran into another guy who said he got in because he got in line before they opened. "
,,,,,I'm including some pictures of the indoors as well--it's adorable!
,,,,,HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
,,,,,"I love the ambiance inside Pink Door, super cute date night. We were lucky to have a window seat with a view of the sunset and the ferris wheel."
,,,,,The flank steak is cooked and seasoned perfectly.
,,,,,My squid ink pasta was great! Seasoned well with a generous portion of tender shrimp.
,,,,,Our drinks were super refreshing as well.
,,,,,"As a Seattle native I (usually) reserve my trips to Pike Place for when I am entertaining guests or buying fresh seafood! However, my boyfriend and I decided to spend our 1 year anniversary at Pink Door located just a street up from Pike Place and I couldn't recommend it more. Beautiful ambiance, serving and live music all wrapped up in a uniquely Seattle venue. I especially recommend coming during the holidays because of the decorations, seasonal specials, and view of Pike Place holiday lights from most tables."
,,,,,"We ordered fresh oysters, the cioppino & linguine, and holiday cocktails. Didn't make a reservation (it was Wednesday night) and only had to wait 30 minutes!"
,,,,,"Thank you, Pink Door!"
,,,,,"This place definitely lives up to the hype. Started off with an espresso martini & my boyfriend had a dirty martini. Both were honestly one of the best martinis I've ever had. We had a dozen oysters which ended up being pretty good, even though they didn't have any horseradish or cocktail sauce. Their special topping for them worked really well with the oysters. For main course we ordered the lasagna & the fish of the day which was halibut. Both were super delicious, would order again in a heartbeat. We also decided to try the Brussel sprouts & the meatballs. The Brussel sprouts were super crispy & had bacon with them, just how Brussel sprouts should be. The meatballs were good, not the best I've had but definitely good. Main course is served with bread which we used to soak up the rest of the sauces. We finished off our meal with the pumpkin pecan blonde brownie which was super yummy. 100% a wonderful experience here. Our waitress *kristy was also very attentive & helpful. The guy pouring water was very on top of things. My water was never empty. I will be returning to try some of their other dishes."
,,,,,"Best cheesecake I've ever eaten, and same for the scallops and oysters! Also delicious cocktails. Servers were very kind and helpful."
,,,,,"Very cool place, the front door is hidden in a back alley. There's a beautiful outdoor rooftop patio. I really enjoyed our ceasar salad as our appetizer and I enjoyed the most with my linguine and clams. The bread was good too."
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Hard to get a reservation here and rightfully so. This place is Farm2Table, but also fancy Italian at the same time. It's definitely an intimate, romantic spot. "
,,,,,"I got to try the Vegetarian Lasagna, the gnocchi, and the risotto (which is seasonal). The gnocchi could've used a bit more flavoring even though the pasta itself is well made. The risotto is near perfect, although I was just not a fan of some of the vegetables in it. The lasagna is something else though. It is light and rich at the same time. The spinach layer mixes really well with the sauce and the cheese is not too overwhelming. Honestly would've just eaten that lasagna all day if I could. The wine that our waiter recommended was also great. "
,,,,,"The desserts are nothing to write home about, I was a bit underwhelmed because I thought they'd be a lot fancier, but the peanut butter sundae was definitely solid and a good way to end the meal."
,,,,,"Hands down my favorite meal we had in Seattle! I am so happy that we decided to make a reservation and come here. It is a little hard to find, but just look for the pink door in the alley and you are at the right spot. "
,,,,,"We were seated outside, which was beautiful! Overlooking the water in the distance. There was live music inside, and you could hear it being played over the speakers, which was nice. The complimentary bread was incredible. Tasted so fresh, and was warm. For entrees, I got the linguine and clams and my friend got the bolognese. The linguine and clams was 100% the best linguine and clams I have ever had. The pasta was undeniably fresh, and the clams were just as delicious. I had a bite of the bolognese and that was very tasty as well. To end the meal, we got the trio of gelato which was light and refreshing. Just wish they had tiramisu (my favorite!) If/when I am back in Seattle this place will always land itself on my itinerary."
,,,,,"Had the lamb shank and lasagna plus Caesar salad. All awesome. Gordon Ramsey would be proud  Also some Masterchef bread appeteezers. Both melt in your mouth. Yum yum. Gimme some seconds please. Oh you have some espresso cheesecake I see? Yes, give me that too, thank you. Yum yum."
,,,,,"Had  An INCREDIBLE Birthday  Meal Here , For Myself. Mia Was WONDERFUL  As My Server , The Lamb Shank Was Devine . Kusshi Oysters & Zeppolle For Dessert ..."
,,,,,"The nondescript entrance is tricky to find! I must have walked 500+ extra steps in circles while searching for this place. And it's a good thing I did, because I went to town on the delicious arancini and linguine alle vongole (sans pancetta). But don't think I forgot the roughage - the Everything Green salad with fresh Bibb lettuce and crunchy pistachios was a delightful way to squeeze in some fiber for a worry-free day."
,,,,,WOW. This place. PHENOMENAL!
,,,,,"We were able to snag a 9:15pm reservation on a Friday night for a party of 6. Our vaccination cards were checked before we were promptly seated, live music playing right next to our table!"
,,,,,"The food is really quite phenomenal. I was able to taste the the arancini, pappardelle and basil cake - all of which had perfectly balanced flavors - the arancini in particular was a taste explosion."
,,,,,"There's a reason everyone from Seattle says to come here, it really is quite amazing."
,,,,,We wanted to make reservations here for dinner but decided to come for lunch instead . 
,,,,,Let's just start with the entrance super cute and hidden access to the front door with a cute little pink door.
,,,,,The inside is magical it's like you're at the circus but very well decorated.
,,,,,My husband got the meatball sandwich which he said was the best!
,,,,,I got the clams and mussels which was really good if you don't feel like having pasta.
,,,,,We will definitely go back again
,,,,,100 stars. Best lasagna in the WORLD!!!! And I am not exaggerating! Highly recommend!
,,,,,"We ordered sooo many great things from this place! Probably the best Italian food I have had in awhile. We ordered the clam linguine, mussels and clams, squid ink pasta, charcuterie board, and so much more but those were the few that I definitely enjoyed! We were able to get a reservation luckily! And was seated outdoors in the patio area where the weather was perfect, food was amazing, and the service was 100%! I'm coming back again for you @thepinkdoor!!!"
,,,,,What a phenomenal restaurant tucked away in post alley. Recently had dinner here and I was in awe of how exclusive the place felt. Thankfully they are checking vaccination cards for all patrons which made me feel safe about being inside with that many people. The service was friendly and professional. My partner and I were seated on the stage in the dining room. This was the best seat in the house as it was right next to the entertainment. There was a woman there who performed an amazing acrobatic routine throughout the night. The ambiance of the restaurant reminded me of a quirky European vintage vibe. Hard to explain but it works and you have to see it for yourself. The food...delicious. I had linguine alle vongole which is linguine and clams which was served piping hot with perfectly al dente pasta and loads of fresh clams tossed in a garlicky sauce. My partner ordered the rigatoni with mama's meatballs and he really enjoyed it. The portions were large and reasonably priced. I'd love to go back the next time I'm in Seattle.
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Wow. If I could give a restaurant 6/5 stars I would give it to this one. One of the best places I've ever eaten at. Firstly, the entrance was quite literally a pink door. I love that hidden speakeasy feel and it took my friend and I a few moments to actually find the entrance. When we then entered, the restaurant was beautiful. Love the setup and the entertainment. Finally, the food was incredible. The lamb shank was tender and incredibly flavorful. The complimentary bread was an incredibly nice touch. Truly a once in a lifetime experience and I plan on visiting again in the future."
,,,,,I went here twice in the 4 days I was visiting Seattle for a wedding..... so what does that tell you ?
,,,,,Great food and ambiance! Went here twice while in Seattle and I was only there for 4 days
,,,,,"My first time at The Pink Door and I guess I really don't know the color of pink that well LOL. Totally walked by but then actually found it. Striking ambiance inside which reminds me of Paris even though I've never been there LOL. I ordered a raw tuna appetizer which was delicious, but came across a bunch of silver skin. My girlfriend had the small charcuterie board and let me tell you, I could order that just for dinner it was so lovely and wonderful. Between the three of us we ordered the rigatoni, the lamb shank and the chicken breast. I do have to say my chicken breast was rather dry and I was a little surprised to find that the whipped ricotta underneath it was cold. Guess I should have known but it was still a little uncomfortable if you will to have a hot piece of chicken on cold ricotta. That said, when I told our waitperson about the tuna the manager not only took it off my bill, but offered all three of us a complimentary dessert. The holiday sugar cookie with the poached pear was pretty nondescript, the grapefruit jelly with the donuts was absolutely to die for I could have drank that on its own. That said, I had a few doughnuts left over that I brought home for the next day and when I opened the box they were nothing but a doughy buttery mess which was pretty disappointing. The espresso chocolate mousse is by far the best. Customer service was above & beyond, and then some. Don't know when I will be back because the menu is pretty limited, but I'm sure I will!"
,,,,,"This is an amazing restaurant with awesome service, attractive decor with soothing music and great food! They deserve 5-stars but I'll explain why I gave them 4-stars."
,,,,,"Everything element perfectly fine. The entrance in the ally was a little confusing at first but we found our way. Upon entry the place looked small but there's a much larger section in the back. The tables were socially distanced and the server gave us their mask wearing best practices. The risotto and clams were delicious, I love them both for very different reasons. The risotto was full of flavor and very hearty, the clams were fresh and fragrant and the sauce was divine. We opted for tiramisu which was a major dissatisfaction. I had high expectations after their entrees but the dessert fell flat. There was hardly any taste of the coffee liqueur coming through, it was basically just a creamy light sponge cake. I have had better store bought tiramisu to be honest. "
,,,,,"Overall, worth the dollar, worth the experience, please skip the tiramisu for the life of God."
,,,,,Omg!!!!!! YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE IF YOU ARE IN SEATTLE! The best noodles I have ever had. Don't miss it tho! If you see a pink door you have found it literally. We almost missed it. It's right next to an Irish pub! Make sure you have your vaccination card for service!
,,,,,Just want to start by saying thank goodness they are checking Vaccine Cards and IDs in order to enter!! I support this effort 150%!! 
,,,,,I love The Pink Door soo so much I cannot get enough of this place. So glad they are reopen for dine in for both lunch and dinner. 
,,,,,My sister and I were in the city and were going to try our luck at walking in for a table and just waiting. But luckily at the last minute I was able to find an open reservation. Probably due to some cancellations. 
,,,,,"Anyways, of course the bread with their house made oil was soo good. We also got the grilled figs to start and it was amazing. The goat cheese was very... pungent ? But in a really good way since the sweetness of the fig and saltiness of the cured meat just cut out the moldy cheese taste haha. "
,,,,,"I got the linguine and she got the bolognese (admittedly, that is what we always get haha) and still left very full and extremely satisfied. Next time I'll probably try the gnocchi since it has mushrooms and truffle! Yum yum!"
,,,,,I've been waiting for pink door to reopen and i was not disappointed when they did! 
,,,,,I am not the biggest fan of Italian food (shocking I know!) but I adore this restaurant. 
,,,,,Whenever I am able to come here with my family or friends I leave super satisfied and happy. It is a great place for dinner and drinks. They do have a 1.5 hour maximum time for your reservation though! 
,,,,,Honestly any pasta you get here will be amazing. The bolognese is seriously the best though. And the squid ink pasta was sooo yummy. It came with so much seafood and it had a wonderful little spicy kick to it. 
,,,,,The cheese board has the most unique items that all mesh super well together. 
,,,,,"The daily special we got was this tortellini filled with various different game, all simmered in this beef broth. It was suuuper good. A little salty for me but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. "
,,,,,Our server came back many many times to check in on us so it was nice to have that great service as well.
,,,,,"A funky vibe, in a restaurant that feels hidden away in Pike's Place market. With nightly entertainment, the meal feels like a full sensory experience. The bartenders are so kind, explaining each drink, presenting wine options, and leading us to a delicious cocktail. We split the Caesar salad with shrimp and ciopinno pink door. Both were delicious with a generous portion of fresh Seattle seafood. Our entertainment was an aerial performance. My only complaint was I wish she performed for longer than a song every hour! A fun experience if you're visiting Seattle!"
,,,,,The restaurant was beautiful inside
,,,,,The view on the water was nice
,,,,,The servers were kind and attentive 
,,,,,I had mentioned it was my bday and maybe 4 people wished me happy birthday and gave me a good a spot to sit in.  
,,,,,The food was very good! Smoked gouda/eggplant pasta (i am vegetarian!) yum. 
,,,,,I had a basil cake with rhubarb jam
,,,,,Also; they forgot to make my cappuccino but because the time was up (90min?) i offered to take it to go and instead they gave it to me for free.    
,,,,,Mainly i loved the interior decorations!
,,,,,"Great spot for entertainment and good Italian food. We had a reservation for 7:45 but didn't get our table until 8. That was a strong indication of how the rest of our night went. We got the house antipasto, burrata, and olive oil bread as starters. Mushroom risotto, Caesar salad, Herb fries, and their Lasagna for the mains. The food was great, and their current dessert special is absolutely delicious. But the service was crazy slow! We waited half an hour just for their complementary bread service. Oh, and there is almost no chance of getting a table unless you have a reservation :)"
,,,,,"I was very excited to try Pink Door as I have heard from all the locals that it is the place to be. I had to wake up very early, 30 days in advance to get a reservation so as you would expect my expectations were through the roof. Notable mentions are the ambiance you feel when you arrive. As it was a Thursday evening they had a live trapeze artist which was very unique. My main complaint was the lack of selections on the menu. If you are not feeling seafood pasta you really have skim options. Out of all three dishes we ordered the lasagna was absolutely the best - probably the best lasagna I've ever had. So do I recommend this place, yes but you have to go in knowing the limitations and difficulties creating a reservation!"

,,,,,"I visited this place twice recently. the first time, I didn't have reservation, but got the bar seating after some waiting. Since I hadn't dine before, I asked for vegetarian recommendation from the server, she mentioned an eggplant dish, which was kinda okay, nothing special.  My wife ordered Oyster's I think, which were fresh and tasted better.  Anyway, I thought the food was meh, ambience was nice (live music performance by local Artists.). But it was overpriced in my opinion. "
,,,,,"the second visit was definitely better. We had reservations, got a table in the back dining room that has nice views of the Seattle waterfront. We ordered a lasagna and some scallops entrée, both were really tasty but had small portion size.  "
,,,,,"Overall, I would say it's definitely a romantic place (there were a lot of couples in the restaurant!) with quality food (if you know what to order!). But be prepared to shell out $75-$100 per person!"
,,,,,Came here on beautiful Saturday with a group of girlfriends. Reservations fill up quickly so make it in advance! It was all outdoor seating in a patio area and weather was really nice. 
,,,,,For a group of 6 we ordered: 
,,,,,2 Caesar Salad
,,,,,2 Pappardelle Al Ragu Bolognese
,,,,,2 Meatballs a la carte
,,,,,2 Garlic bread
,,,,,2 Raviolis 
,,,,,Everything was really good!! The raviolis were vegetarian and a huge hit with the group. I personally loved the meatballs and bolognese the most! I'd definitely come back when I'm craving pasta and try the rest of the menu
,,,,,Friends told us we NEEDED to eat here during our trip and we were able to snag a reservation for 7:45pm.
,,,,,"It was not hard to find the entrance and upon entering it is not what was expected, but in a good way! It was warm and lively inside and after checking in and showing our vaccine cards we were walked to our table in the back room."
,,,,,"Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I ordered the linguine and my friends orders the lasagna and the Chef's choice of fish. The linguine was delicious and savory, lots of flavor and the portion was a good size. My friends lasagna was well done and she enjoyed every bite. My other friends meal was a fish with green salsa and pesto and she said she really liked it. "
,,,,,The drink I got was apple cider with brandy which sounded great in theory but once it was prepared it was not the best mix in my opinion. I honestly only took one sip and left the rest.
,,,,,"I gave it 4 stars as well as the meal was great but it also was hyped as THE BEST and in all honesty, it was great but it wasn't something I couldn't find elsewhere. We were also extremely hungover so that may also come into play."
,,,,,My recommendation would be to go when not hungover LOL.
,,,,,"Great location. Once you step in it really is amazing. You take steps down to the dining area where everyone sits and they do have a bar. Great ambiance and live music. We came on a Saturday night and they had musicians. Friends and I had the roussanne white wine which was good. My friend had the nerello red wine, margarita and  oh my last word. We ordered the truffled mushroom crostini, it's good if you like mushrooms. The lasagna was really delicious and flavorful, highly recommended. The lamb chop and cod were also enjoyable. The donuts are also good. Our waiter, Lola was amazing and helped make our night even better."
,,,,,"Very impressed with the service, the the black ink spaghetti was savory and delicious. "
,,,,,The restaurant itself has live music some nights. I recommend reserving a table if you can and coming appropriately dressed.
,,,,,Discriminatory behavior. Tests and proof the day before and I have a medical condition where I cannot get their accepted status. Yet was denied entry due to Karen the owner. I wonder how many have her preferred status and did not take a test before (none I'm sure) and can still have what she is foolishly championing. Not a scientist I can assure you. Welcome to Seattle.
,,,,,"Ok, so everyone raves about this place so I had to try it. And I was unfortunately underwhelmed. Our server was amazing though and totally made up for the experience."
,,,,,"We had the bruschetta for appetizers. It was pretty good. Not the most amazing, but good enough. "
,,,,,"I ordered the linguine and my friend ordered the lasagne. The linguine was ok, nothing special. The price was decent for what it was. "
,,,,,The lasagne was better than the linguine though. And prices were decent. 
,,,,,"Food was just ok, but service was great!"
,,,,,"Super cute place! There was a live band playing when we went, and we didn't have to wait long for a table of 4. Got the pink drink (first on drink menu) that donates which is awesome. Table bread was a bit on the harder side to chew, but good flavor. We ordered the lasagna, the potato gnocchi, the risotto, and the fries for the table. The lasagna was awesome, the fries were super crispy, but the gnocchi and risotto were standard. Cute ambiance and would come back."
,,,,,This place is really cute and super close to Pike Place. The service was good and they made me a really good espresso martini. I ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole and it was a lot of food. The bread was good too.
,,,,,"Where do I start?!? This joint is a hidden gem! Great ambiance, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Our server Ryan was top notch! He knew the menu inside and out and his recommendations were spot on!"
,,,,,Definitely a great dining experience and the views are breathtaking! Will be back again and again!

,,,,,"My boyfriend and I booked a last minute trip to Seattle in mid-October. While I was doing research, the Pink Door came up in my search for a fun place to eat. Unfortunately, when I tried to make online reservations they were booked up for the Sunday night we were trying to go. Lucky for us, our schedule allowed us to get there around 5:30 (close to the time they open for dinner) that night. We could have sat at the bar and ate but we chose to wait for about an 1.5 hours so we could have a seat at a table. "
,,,,,"We had an incredible server, she was attentive and had great food and drink recommendations. I had a raspberry lemon drop (made with their homemade raspberry vodka) and my boyfriend had a moscow mule with tequila. Both drinks were a 10/10!! I had the off the menu squid ink pasta, which was fabulous & my boyfriend had the chicken which he thought was good but could have been better. "
,,,,,"The icing on the cake to our experience was the outstanding aerial show. The artist performed three times while we were at dinner (we were there for about 2.5 hours). She performed for about 10-15 minutes, which I thought was the perfect amount of time. People aren't allowed to record or take photos of the performance but that made me enjoy the show even more. The performance was such a great addition to our little night out."
,,,,,"If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind dining experience, The Pink Door is your place to go!"
,,,,,"Absolutely delicious and such a beautiful restaurant! Highly recommend the bruschetta, we stopped by around early August and since the tomatoes were in season, it was insanely juicy and fresh. You definitely need a reservation, so make sure you get one! It can be a bit difficult to find, but it literally does have a pink door :)"
,,,,,"The staff was so friendly and hospitable. They went above and beyond. Nice and cozy ambiance. Beautiful light fixtures and decor. The food was amazing. I ordered the clam linguini. Noodles cooked to perfection, delicious sauce and loaded with clams. The entrance is a cute pink door (hence the name) which leads you downstairs to the dining room. You feel like you are transported into another world upon entry."
,,,,,"Solid 3 stars, 1.5 for the food and 4.5 for the service. If you're looking for a decent Italian spot in prime touristy spot, fame Pike market, then this is a good option. But if you're looking for a really good Italian joint, then IMO, this isn't it. I am not a chef but the whole time we were there, I knew I could make the dishes much better. The lamb shank was flavorless and very dry. Service was professional and very good."
,,,,,"Delicious meal, executed with exceptional service! Everything we tasted resulted in a fantasy on our tongues! "
,,,,,"Service was lively, attentive and excellent!"
,,,,,"The Pink Door is such a cool find in Seattle. I ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole and it did not disappoint! An enormous number of clams served with a creamy white wine pasta was something I didn't know I needed until I had it. Each bite was delectable and it left me craving it for weeks after. The location itself is in the middle of the Post Alley but it isn't too hard to find, especially on a busier night and the people are congregating. Inside feels like a jazz club, with live music playing if you're lucky. The ambience is great and I really enjoyed my meal and my experience there. Reservations are a must if you want to make sure you get a good seat on a great night."
,,,,,Fantastic meal. Highly recommended! Great service and the food was equally great. I went on my birthday and they made it very special.
,,,,,"It's hard to get into this one, get reservations in advance. The ambience, service and food all are excellent. "
,,,,,Their fish of the day and lasagna are some of the go-tos.
,,,,,This place was super beautiful and unique. The food was delicious! I got the Ahi Tuna and it was so fresh and citrusy.
,,,,,This place was highly recommended as one of the top places to go to in Seattle. It is sad that it only took me around 4 years to go.
,,,,,"On a Saturday night ~7:30 pm, I was able to walk in as a solo diner. Before walking in, they had asked for my Id and my vaccination card. They did allow for photos of vaccination cards but it was just easier at the time to give my physical one and they matched it with the name of my id. "
,,,,,"They asked if I minded being seated indoors and I didn't. However, I wished I asked for bar seating instead of a table. Not that the table was bad, but I had a full view of the performers and was seated just under people seated at the bar. The romantic seating I was at would be better suited for a couple rather than me by myself (though I was cute for the night). The music was great and set the ambiance of the night. In the menu, they had a list of who was performing and who will perform which is great for return dates"
,,,,,"My server was so sweet and helped me decide what I wanted from the many great options. I can say that I actually had a hard choice of choosing what I wanted because there were 4-6 things I wanted. I chose the infamous lasagna and since there was apparently space in my stomach, the penn cove clams and mussels. "
,,,,,"I was truly satisfied by the dishes. As someone who is not the biggest proponent of lasagna, their spinach was a great dish. I typically love clams and mussels and I was happy to see they had mussels of a big size as some places may only serve tiny ones. Shoutout to that toasted garlic bread, it was only through sheer will power that I didn't finish it immediately. "
,,,,,"Overall, I'm going to comeback for lunch. There are pasta dishes that I am eager to try."

,,,,,"What a gem of a place!  My family is in Seattle a handful of times a year and finally got a table here. We felt pampered by the great service and beautiful interior.  And the food was near perfection. We enjoyed the meatball appetizer, linguini with clams, cioppino and risotto.  I would suggest requesting a table in the rear dining room with a ton of windows and natural light.  Oh"
,,,,,"Dining @thepinkdoorrestaurant in Seattle was probably one of the best experiences. I swear this place looks like it's been around since the 50s. Absolutely stunning decor and homey vibes. My server was such a pleasure he was down to earth, fun and very helpful. I sat in the best seat in the house on the rooftop patio. "
,,,,,"And after my amazing cup of meatballs I had to top it off with an ""affogato al caffe"" or as my server informed me, ""drowned"" in Italian. A gelato ""drowned"" with a shot of hot espresso.   "
,,,,,My server also reminded me that I probably wouldn't sleep that night ! He wasn't wrong!
,,,,,.
,,,,,Just keep your eye out for the pink door!   next time you are in Seattle! 
,,,,,.
,,,,,.
,,,,,I wouldn't miss this place if it's your first time in Seattle!
,,,,,"Very much enjoyed our meal here, lasagne and the fish were great! Great atmosphere for a date night."
,,,,,This is a really popular spot in Seattle but we came an hour before closing and were able to get seated right away.
,,,,,"The food was really good. Especially the Salmon Special was very well cooked, seasoned, and plated. The homemade sourdough was one of the best sourdough I've ever had. The crust was crispy and insides were very soft. Bread is provided for dinner (not sure about lunch)"
,,,,,The band is fun and very talented but since we were seated right by the band it was fairly loud.. 
,,,,,Overall:
,,,,,Food: 9/10
,,,,,Ambiance: 8/10
,,,,,Service: 10/10
,,,,,"This is in the heart of Downtown right in Pike Place. Parking is a bit challenging so make sure to plan in advanced as it's either meter or parking lots. This is kind of hidden since there is no sign pointing The Pink Door, it's through an alley and literally the most distinctive thing is the fact it's a pink door that leads into the restaurant. My picture turned out blurry so I couldn't shared it which was disappointing, but an excuse to go back. Also, keep in mind reservations are a must. You can't do walk in's and if you do you'll be lucky. The restaurant is spacious, you enter at the top of the stairs where the host/hostess is and check in for your reservation. During the time of Covid they do ask for proof of vaccination and ID so make sure to have those handy. As the host directs you down the stairs to another check in desk, they walk you to the dining room. You walk through the first part of the dining room, through narrow dining area past the small stage they have as well as the patio and then leading into a dining room that overlooks the Ferris wheel for an amazing view. We had the Truffled Mushroom Crostini, the fraiche just melted into the crostini and the mushroom was sautéed perfectly. The Caesar salad was ok, nothing that stands out to me. The Tortellini had 9 pieces, the broth was well seasoned, the tortellini themselves are very rich so I would almost say to share this with someone else. The Pappardelle was handmade and the sauce was balanced nicely so it wasn't salty or heavy. The Linguine wasn't too rich, sometimes with Linguine the sauce is too salty or too heavy and this was just enough of both clams and pasta. My friend who has the Ribeye said everything was amazing, keep in mind this is 14oz so it is a bigger portion size. Overall I have it 4 stars because nothing wowed me too much. I enjoyed the ambience and having the experience since everyone talks about this place. But I thought it was ok to me."
,,,,,Visited The Pink Door on our second night of our trip to Seattle. We were advised by our friends to make a reservation weeks ahead of our trip because it's usually hard to get a table without one. Our reservation was at 5:30pm on a Thursday night and thank goodness we had a reservation considering the line went all the up the stairs. 
,,,,,We got seated at the back area where they have large panes windows overlap the bay. If you're seated at the right spot you'll have a great view of the Ferris wheel. 
,,,,,For food we ordered: 
,,,,,Antipasto is the house
,,,,,Pappardelle al ragu bolognese
,,,,,Spring risotto
,,,,,Everything was delicious.
,,,,,Service took a little long but we understood considering we're in a middle of a pandemic. Businesses everywhere have definitely took a hit with staffing. So in the meantime we just enjoyed the moment.
,,,,,Great place! Amazing food! And live performance as you enjoy you meal. Highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle!!
,,,,,The Pink Door is a hidden spot near Pike Place Market. It's in an alley near a pub. Right now you have to be fully vaccinated to eat there. You can bring the original vaccination card or just a very good picture of it. I got the spinach pasta lasagna. It was so good and full of flavor. I highly recommend this dish. The peanut butter brownie desert was yummy for my tummy. I truly enjoyed everything I ate and the cocktail I drank. Make a reservation when you are going to be in Seattle. You will not regret it.
,,,,,"I celebrated my birthday here and it seems like the birthday place to be. There was a band playing the in the front room. We were seated in the back. I had the linguine al vongole and the clams were fine. Nothing stand out but still delicious. The restaurant itself had great ambiance. Probably about what I imagined it to be, meeting expectations. They did check for proof of vaccination in the front, so that was nice. Overall, I would recommend."
,,,,,"Exceptional service! My boyfriend and I had a hard time finding this place around the Pike Market place but the lady on the phone was very patient and kind in guiding us to the right place. We ended up being 10-15 minutes late for our reservation but they still had our tables reserved. Upon seating, the waiter was welcoming and seemed informative on the reason for our visit (which was because of my boyfriend and I's anniversary that I mentioned in the notes of the reservation). I was surprised they even said anything since most restaurants often overlook that detail."
,,,,,I wasn't sure what to expect from Pink Door since it looked like any other Italian restaurant to me but the overwhelming number of reviews of this place must mean something good. Setting up a reservation was easy through their website. We ordered their infamous lasagna with a side of meatballs and Linguine Alloe Vongole. The lasagna was amazing! That was the best lasagna I've ever had along with the meatballs. The linguine surprisingly came with a lot of clams. I was honestly expecting a small handful but it came with a generous portion. I'm not a huge fan of linguine pasta itself but this one hit the spot.
,,,,,The food was delicious and I would consider coming back here if I were to visit Seattle again. At least this time I'll know where it is hidden in an alley across the pub.

,,,,,"Enjoyed a delicious lunch of Antipasto, cioppino, pappardelle al ragu bolognese, and grilled garlic bread. Garlic bread was amazing. The pasta in the pappardelle tasted fresh and handmade. Classy, sophisticated, spacious environment. The window seats had expansive views of the water. It was a perfect place to be on a cold, rainy afternoon in Seattle.  The waitstaff was very courteous and helpful. They require an id and proof of vacation as you check in. Felt very clean and safe."
,,,,,"Great service, great dinning experience, wonderful menu! Reasonable price!!! "
,,,,,"There is a reason to such high review and rating from people. This is a must try restaurant if you are visiting from somewhere else. The seafood, the taste are wonderful!"
,,,,,Average price is around 50-70/person
,,,,,"This dining experience was amazing! I would suggest you make reservations Bc if not, you may not get to experience the fresh seafood! Lol.  I will say, If you make reservations and the weather is perfect, reserve outside dining. It oversees the water and the view of the sunset is unforgettable. It was very pleasant. "
,,,,,"The ambiance was peaceful and serene being on the patio and seeing the water. The restaurant is tucked in this super cute alleyway and sits across from a wine bar and other dining spot. The door is actually pink, which helped us navigate where we were. The service was attentive, quick and the server was very knowledgeable. He welcomed us in and gave us information before we could even ask, which was a nice touch. "
,,,,,"Food: food was immaculate. It was packed with flavor. The oysters were super fresh. They were served with a frozen balsamic vinaigrette to top it.  The lasagna was aromatic of pesto and fresh marinade. The halibut was a mouthful of so many different flavors with everything it was complimented with. The clam fettuccine was super light and flavorful. We washed our food down with a ""Justice for George Floyd"" cocktail with $1 of the proceeds going to the NAACP. "
,,,,,It was just an amazing dining experience. I would so go back if I'm ever in Seattle again. I'm so glad we were able to get in. 5 stars!
,,,,,TIP: Make your reservations EARLY. They definitely fill up quickly even on weekdays. We wanted to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary and managed to get a reservation on a Wednesday at 9:15 PM. (LOL) 
,,,,,"We were staying super close that evening so stopped by to see how busy it was, two hours before our reservation. Needless to say they were busy, but we were able to check in and they would call us when a table was available with a friendly reminder that we likely would not have to wait until 9:15 PM. (YAY). "
,,,,,"ANOTHER TIP: Make sure you bring a copy of your vaccine card, you must be fully vaxed! And if you have any complaints regarding this, they are doing just fine without your business. "
,,,,,"We sat outside and was able to enjoy the light set off the buildings, we don't get a great view of the water since it's only a floor up but you get the picture. Our server was awesome. She was able to let us know if we were ordering too much and what she recommended from the menu. We got the Arancini as an appetizer. Can skip out on this, something you can find at the Texas State Fair. We also got the truffle fries, super good and be sure to eat the fried basil and rosemary! We shared their infamous vegetarian lasagna and it was VERY rich, very good and definitely be sure to share because it can be a lot for one person. "
,,,,,"Overall, a good experience. Definitely a lot to try from the menu but we didn't have the capacity to add on another dish. Another thing I was disappointed with was they did not do anything for celebrations. I get that it's a tourist destination and people may take advantage, but a little something wouldn't hurt and would add onto the dining experience in my opinion!"
,,,,,"Ambiance was great along with service.  Food was pretty good, not spectacular but very very good."
,,,,,Known for good consistent food and service just steps from Pike Place Market. And even better when the weather cooperates for dining on the deck with a view.

,,,,,-The host was very accommodating when we wished a table as close to the open door (to the deck). 
,,,,,Dining
,,,,,Indoor dining with spacing. They ask to keep masks on until served. The deck wasn't available today due to rain (& some winter damage).
,,,,,Located
,,,,,-Almost in the middle of the alleyway behind the building block where Starbucks is located 
,,,,,-Half block north of Beecher's Cheese or Sur La Table
,,,,,-Look for the pink door (across from The Tasting Room) and walk down the stairs.
,,,,,"The grilled bread (la fettunta)- do it. I was staying in Seattle for a week and despite many solid options I came here twice just because of that bread. I wouldn't say I'm a carb fiend but I'd I'm going to go for it, I go all out, no holding back. This is worth messing up your diet for, just an FYI. "
,,,,,"Second, the grilled fish special (yellow eye rockfish) is absolutely divine. Perfectly grilled and seasoned very simply - if you've ever eaten fresh grilled seafood in the Venice / Burano area you know what I'm talking about. It was served with a white bean ragu, and despite not being a huge bean fan it was pretty good. "
,,,,,"The tuna carpaccio was also delish, i enjoyed how juicy the citrus made this dish without being overpowering and it helped cut some of the fattiness from the olive oil. The bolognese is as amazing as it looks and you can tell that pasta is perfect from the first bite. "
,,,,,"The setting and ambience of the main dining room is wonderful. Despite being a solo diner I got front and center seats by the window to look out at the water. The place setting was so pretty I had to take a photo to show my manager ideas. Service is excellent as well - I did a boneheaded tourist move on my second trip here and forgot my credit cards in my hotel, but thankfully they have QR payment to allow for a seamless touch free payment."
,,,,,"Came here with a friend to celebrate her birthday. It was a very nice atmosphere with delicious food. I was torn between one of the specials and the original lasagna. The waiter convinced me to get the lasagna since it is what they are known for and it's the best in town. I decided to go with his suggestion and get the lasagna. It was delicious and I'm glad I chose it. It was a mix of pesto and marinara, cooked to perfection. Parking is tough, either expensive garage parking or street parking, which is tough to find. Also recommend making a reservation well in advance. They are booked up even a month before your hopeful date."
,,,,,"Great great great spot! Perfect for date night , perfect t for any night! Came here for dinner , our first night in Seattle and it was just awesome. From the ambiance, to the food, to our waiter everything was just great and it was really just an awesome experience. If ever in Seattle def check this place out, it's nestled in a cute alley way and surrounded by lights and looks out to the pier , great spot! "
,,,,,"Also , must add our waiter Mike was phenomenal! Great service, great recommendations and just all around a cool guy!"
,,,,,I loved everything about my experience here. 
,,,,,We ordered: 
,,,,,The Ahí Tuna Crudo
,,,,,Bruschetta 
,,,,,Pink Door Caesar 
,,,,,Linguine Alle Vongole
,,,,,Pappardelle Al Ragú Bolognese
,,,,,& a half bottle of their Frank Family Chardonnay 
,,,,,"Everything, and I mean everything was delicious! "
,,,,,The stand out was absolutely the ragú bolognese sauce. We were scraping our plate with the bread we had left over to get all the sauce! 
,,,,,We were lucky to be seated upfront by the stage next to the cellist.

,,,,,"Find the door surrounded by twinkly string lights! I was looking for the ""pink"" door but it was not very obvious to me. It was located downstairs and because of it it kind of seemed very hush hush and members only kind of vibes. Reservations required."
,,,,,I wanted something with pesto in it so I decided to get the pink door lasagna. There was marinara on top which was overpowering the more basic taste of the pesto. It tasted more like a regular lasagna to me. Wasn't too impressed. Didn't see any other pesto dish on the menu. It was small and $22. Not too bad but I've had better. 4 stars for me. Service was excellent.
,,,,,"Amazing lighting, music, and atmosphere. Sitting at the bar area is great, especially with the staff being as friendly as they are. The appetizers were tasty and plentiful! Definitely try the fries."
,,,,,"My group of 4 came as a walk-in on a Sunday night at 5pm and had a 2 hour wait to be seated. Although the wait was pretty long, the food and ambiance definitely made up for it. "
,,,,,"The complimentary bread and olive oil was really delicious. We ordered the linguine alle vong, pappardelle al ragu, potato gnoochi, and cioppiano. Every single dish was incredible - we finished everything super quickly. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Clam linguine was super light and yummy with a ton of clams on top. "
,,,,,For dessert we had the basil cake which was a really unique flavor (kinda had some pesto flavor) and the peanut butter brownie sundae (super chocolatey and delicious but very heavy).
,,,,,"Our server was really nice and friendly, great ambiance and service."
,,,,,"This place is great! So cool. It's an unmarked treasure with excellent food, service and ambiance. We came here on a word of mouth recommendation on a Wednesday night. We had to show proof of vaccination. We walked in and were seated within 10 minutes around 5:30. The bartender and servers were amazing! So nice! The oysters were a little small and expensive for 1/2 dozen in November, but that's the only possible negative thing I could say about the place. We had clam linguine and clams and mussels. The sauce and flavors were extraordinary. Entertainment starts at 7:00. Jazz was very entertaining and apple cake was subtle and not too sweet. Enjoy the experience!"
,,,,,4.5 star rating
,,,,,"I would highly recommend making a reservation since this place is super popular. My friends and I walked in during late afternoon to get a table for the night, and got a waitlist spot that was available 1 hour later. We didn't mind the wait since we were early and there was a lot in the area to look around. We took a stroll around Pike Place and enjoyed the view next to the water and the ferris wheel."
,,,,,We were seated in the outdoor area with a good view. The atmosphere was quite nice. I forgot the waiter's name but he was really nice and patient by explaining the dishes and even off-menu items. We were also served bread and olive oil before our entrees came.
,,,,,I ended up getting the Penn Cove Clams & Mussels. The garlic bread was very crispy and well-flavored. They were very generous with the clams and mussels. The sauce buttery and savory. It tasted amazing when dipping the garlic bread and the clams & mussels in the sauce. The portion was okay but you would definitely get full from the shared bread and olive oil. 
,,,,,"For drinks, I got their Sangria. It was sweet and cold. It was definitely pricey but we felt like we had to get a drink eating at a fancy place like this."
,,,,,We came here two hours before our reservation and was seated promptly. The inside of the restaurant is so interesting and gorgeous. Lots of things to look at on the walls and it really feels like an antique shop. We were sat in the beautiful well lit room in the back that faces the water. Overall warm and gorgeous vibes.
,,,,,"AHI TUNA CRUDO - fried capers, smoked castelvetrano olives,  microgreens, orange citrus vinaigrette  16"
,,,,,This was SO amazing. I recently tried crudo at another Italian place in San Francisco and it wasn't as balanced in flavor as this one. The sweet and bright orange segments mixed with the salty capers and the slight bitterness of the olives. Extremely fresh ahi. Wow. I would come back just for this dish
,,,,,"LASAGNA PINK DOOR - fresh spinach pasta layered with besciamella, pesto and topped with marinara sauce  19."
,,,,,This was also very good! The pasta was delicate and soft. Each bite was filled with besciamella and the flavors just went really well together without the extreme heaviness of some lasagna  dishes. We were full by the time we got to this course but still finished it. It's small and would not be enough to fill one person (in my opinion)
,,,,,LITTLE GEMS CAESAR
,,,,,with fennel dusted croutons and N.W. Dungeness crab  27.
,,,,,I loved their caesar! I always order a caesar salad wherever I go and this one was great. They coated each whole romaine leaf with tons of dressing but the lettuce still held up its crunch so the dressing didn't make it soggy at all. Croutons were extremely crunchy (watch the roof of your mouth) and they gave a lot of crab meat. I was expecting the crab to bring some sweetness but it was on the saltier side. Very fresh as it didn't smell fishy at all
,,,,,An absolutely incredible experience for anyone who lives in Seattle or is visiting. The Pink Door seems to be a real staple in the area and for so many reasons. I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner and I couldn't have chosen better. 
,,,,,"As many others have stated, it is hard to find if you're not from the area and it's literally just a pink door. No name on the outside, just a pretty pink door! "
,,,,,"This is truly like no other restaurant I have been to before. The décor and seating is stunning and well thought out. We were sat in a room with a view of the marketplace and the waterfront, which was beautifully lit from the sun. "
,,,,,The staff are super nice and professional. You definitely get better service here as it is a fancier restaurant. Our waiter was prompt and made sure we had the best experience.
,,,,,"Now for the food! The heavenly food! For starters, we ordered the asparagus and fries! Literally the best tasting asparagus I've ever had. I would have it everyday if I could. The fries are nothing normal either. They were so well seasoned and not too crispy and not soggy. The sauce was heavenly and complimented the fries incredibly well. For the entrees, I ordered the pink door lasagna. Although I couldn't taste the pesto, it was still a great choice and I absolutely loved it! My sister got the braised short rib and the meat was perfectly cooked and the polenta was such a great compliment to the meal. I did have a bite of the spring risotto and it wasn't great because it didn't have much flavor, so if you like flavor I would probably skip that entrée. "
,,,,,"The food is more expensive, but I think it's worth it for the experience and the taste that you receive. "
,,,,,"Overall, this is a great place to spend an evening with a date or family. The staff are great and the food is even better!"
,,,,,"Not sure if the food quality is worth the hype. I guess the dining environment, service and vibes are what really contributed to our experience. Food is pretty average. "
,,,,,Cioppino Pink Door: a refreshing dish. Various kinds of seafood in a tomato & veggies soup for $27. Linguine Alle Vongole: an average pasta dish. Generous amount of clams and they were flavorful. But the pasta was a bit hard and under seasoned. Spring Risotto & Fish of the Day (also with risotto) were both really yummy. Highly recommend their risotto dishes.
,,,,,"Side dishes, appetizers and desserts: the Arancinis were yummy. Worth trying! Asparagus were salty and heavy. The chocolate coffee pie was so good that we finished it in 2 mins."
,,,,,Wines were okay.
,,,,,"I went here on vacation and luckily scored a table on Thursday night for walk in with no wait. The food, outdoor seating, and service was phenomenal."
,,,,,"The Pappardelle Al Rag Bolognese was my favorite dish and is better than the bolognese at one of my favorite pasta dishes back home in OC. I was throughly impressed with the fresh, handmade noodles and the creamy pink sauce. Definitely miss this dish and will be making an effort to go here again for this dish when I visit Seattle again. Do yourself a favor, come to Pink Door, and order this dish."
,,,,,"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It had great food and service. I made a reservation for 2 and was immediately seated. In my notes, I mentioned I was celebrating my anniversary with my S.O, so they offered us complimentary champagne or sparkling lemonade. My S.O and I were not feeling alcohol, so we went with the lemonade. They offer complimentary bread and olive oil with your meals. The pasta and oysters we ordered were delicious. The service was superb. Definitely would come back to this place again! It was a little hard to find, bc there is no obvious sign that shows you where the place is, but it's located in a little alleyway. It is worth another visit!"
,,,,,Note: this review is a little delayed on being posted.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,One of my most awaited dinners post covid and it certainly exceeded our expectations! Their La Fettunta is to die for and I could just binge on it without any guilt! The lasagna and halibut were great as well. Loved the decor and ambiance too. A must visit for sure! That La Fettunta will keep you going back for more!
,,,,,I went here while visiting Seattle for my husband's birthday. I would give 3.5 stars if I could ... The food is good but overpriced and nothing remarkable.
,,,,,I had the Cioppino Pink Door - it was nothing I would order again. The flavors weren't there. In my opinion definitely not spicy at all and the fish was bland. Would not order again. My husband got the RR ribeye and said it was good. 
,,,,,I do enjoy the ambience of the restaurant and the staff was very friendly and accommodating as we were half an hour early for reservation.
,,,,,Excellent service
,,,,,Excellent food
,,,,,Excellent ambiance
,,,,,"Don't let the ""$$$"" scare you like it *almost* did to me. If you can snag a seat here, I highly recommend sitting outside! Of course, you can't really go wrong with the bar, either."
,,,,,Worth the visit!!!
,,,,,"My friends and I were visiting from Houston and I'd say we're a pretty big food city but this has to be one of the best meals I've ever had. Everything from the ambience, patrons (everyone was so friendly and chatty!!) to our meal was perfect. Forgot to snap a pic of the burrata and heirloom salad but that was super tasty and fresh too! "
,,,,,I'll def be visiting with my family next year!
,,,,,Was absolutely blown away by the food! Each dish we ordered was made to perfection. The ambiance and service was great as well. A perfect spot for a date night!
,,,,,"We decided on The Pink Door to celebrate our anniversary. Reservations were required at the time (this was in March and we did so, easily, through the opentable app)."
,,,,,The entrance is located in Post Alley and has a literal pink door indicating you're in the right place. We walked in and down the stairs to check in.
,,,,,We were greeted and seated immediately in the back area of the restaurant which offered fantastic views of the Puget Sound and waterfront. Our waiter came to our table to introduce himself and take drink orders.
,,,,,"The service, from beginning to end, was fantastic. I wish I could remember his name but he was super attentive, prompt, friendly, and informative (he offered many suggestions for both cocktails and entrees)."
,,,,,"The food? In a word...amazing! I'm not a big fan of Italian restaurants (mostly because Olive Garden ruined it for me) but this place does the country justice. The food was fresh, delicious, and was presented beautifully."
,,,,,"Needless to say, I would absolutely recommend The Pink Door for any special occasion or if you're just looking for fine dining for a quiet, casual night out. I doubt you'll be let down."
,,,,,"Came for a late lunch on a Saturday (only time slot available for reservations) and was seated outside on their patio behind the restaurant. The decor inside is pretty unique (think trapeze), but the patio was cute for a summer day and you can sort of see the water."
,,,,,"Ordered two cocktails, their version of an old fashioned and a seasonal lime vodka drink. Both were good and refreshing."
,,,,,"For food, shared the linguine alle vongole and the squid ink spaghetti. The linguine alle vongole was pretty standard, with a good amount of clam and kind of strong white wine flavors. The squid ink spaghetti was our pick of the two. It was lightly seasoned to be complimented with the shrimp, and a good lemony aftertaste."
,,,,,"Overall, cute spot for a date or special outing, but food was nothing extraordinary (especially for the price)."
,,,,,"We are so glad that we came across this gem during our visit to Seattle! The food is absolutely amazing! The service is excellent and the we love the style of the place, very chic and unexpected from the outside. "
,,,,,"We sat outside because it was ridiculously hot during our time there in Seattle but it was very nice and calm. The food was seriously something out of this world delish! My husband and I had the fried rice balls with saffron. (Y.U.M) for appetizers. I ordered the spring risotto with shrimp; everything was so fresh and delicious! It was such a perfect meal for a nice sunny day near the marketplace. My husband ordered the braised beef with polenta..it was unbelievable. He wouldn't lift his head to breathe, he enjoyed it so much. For dessert we ordered the panna cotta and the cheesecake..both desserts were a perfect ending to a glorious symphonic meal. "
,,,,,"Overall, this place was amazing! You will not regret it and we do plan on coming back when we return! Thanks for the lovely experience pink door!"
,,,,,"Finally had a chance to snag my dinner at The Pink Door! Class meets old Seattle, city views, Italian food and - yes, she's there some nights - a girl on a trapeze."
,,,,,Snag a table in the back if you'd like a view of Elliott Bay; the evening views are expansive. 
,,,,,"Pink Door is one of Seattle's most treasured and longest running restaurants. The lasagna and cioppino recipes have been served for 40 years as of December 2021, and they're worthy."
,,,,,"Lasagne Pink Door is served in oval dish, with hand shaved parmesan. The dish is not a two-story Maggiono's monstrosity; instead, it's about an inch thick of delicious Italian fare. Not swimming in cheese. Could definitely be shared as an appetizer. Generous layer of pesto which seems to be the signature of the dish."
,,,,,Brews on tap included local breweries such as Old Stove and Georgetown's Lucille.
,,,,,I started feeling like I was special because of all the attention I was getting from my server - then I noticed all the servers spending time and chatting with the customers congenially. I'd rate the service as top notch - mine took the time to really check in and see how things were going.
,,,,,"The halibut was sautéed and served on a bed of smashed Yukon Gold potatoes and something like a bruschetta, with a few chunks of fennel that were absolutely delicious - like candy. Some fresh micro greens on top of the fish along with some chopped olives finished the dish."
,,,,,I'll be back soon.
,,,,,"We were originally going to order take out because there were no tables left, but when we called to make sure that they still do take out, we were told that someone had cancelled and we were able to get a table. Heads up: They take reservation, no walk ins on weekends. Another group came in as walk ins because they read on Yelp that no reservations were taken- and that's incorrect info that doesn't reflect recent changes on their website."
,,,,,Ambience:
,,,,,The pink door is definitely a sit down restaurant. The ambience is great- it's got eclectic vintage decor that's super cute. 
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"Okay, not great. The waitress kept hinting that we should pay the kitchen to split a cioppino because it's ""too messy to split."" She did bring us two bowls to split but she didn't seem happy about it."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,"Absolutely amazing. The free bread was delicious (especially when dipped into the sauces of the pastWe got a cioppino, and the clams with white wine sauce pasta, and the basil with rhubarb cake, as well as a cocktail and wine. Everything was delectable. The cioppino was extremely flavorful, and the pasta with the perfect amount of sauce and clams. The cake actually tasted like basil and rhubarb and the flavors blended together seamlessly. "
,,,,,TLDR: a fancy sit down restaurant that you must visit in Seattle!
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Wow! This was our first stop after we landed in Seattle (after checking into our hotel and dropping off our bags, lol)."
,,,,,"We wanted to try Pink Door but was unable to find a reservation even a few weeks prior. We decided to call and the lady on the phone said they accept walk-ins at 5PM, but first come first serve. "
,,,,,"Note: This was on a Thursday, so policies might be different on a weekend."
,,,,,"We got to the restaurant around 4:45PM, and there was one other party waiting in line already. We stuck around and the walk-up line grew immensely. They have two separate lines, one for reservations, and one for walk-ins. The hostess sat all the reservations first, and then walk-ins starting at 5PM. Thus, although we were second in line, we did not get seated until like 5:20. I think most people walking up got seated because the restaurant was probably only half filled by the time we got in."
,,,,,"We decided to order the lasagna pink door and the Cioppino Pink Door to share between the two of us. The Lasagna was pretty good considering it's a vegetarian dish. It's a very unique dish and super rich in flavor. The Cioppino Pink Door was also a good staple dish, but I didn't think it was super special. The seafood was basked in the tomato and white wine broth, but I thought it could have used some stronger flavors. The mussels also had a bad stench."
,,,,,The complimentary bread was delicious though. I loved the olive oil as it was the perfect pairing to the bread and tasted luxurious. I would have loved some balsamic vinegar to pair in addition!
,,,,,"Nevertheless, I had a great experience at Pink Door. I wouldn't come stand in   line for half an hour again, but it was worth trying for sure! If you can get a reservation or find time to wait in line, then go for it :)"
,,,,,"After living in Seattle for a year and finally accepting you will need to make a reservation 4-5 weeks in advance via OpenTable and *hope* you can make it, we dined for dinner on a Sunday night. My first impression was that it was a nice restaurant, but insanely touristy. I wore a dress and nicer sandals (never again considering we walked over from SLU lol), and I was astonished by the number of basketball shorts, sneakers, and birkenstocks I saw at this high(er) end restaurant."
,,,,,They are packed to the brim. Tourists must be making reservations when they plan to visit Seattle. The drinks and food are quite nice though. Everyone expects the price tag but it is a little disappointing the portion is that small for that price. The lasagna is amazing though and practically melts in your mouth. They do offer complimentary bread too which is nice. 
,,,,,"I personally don't think I will come back here for myself, but I would 100% come back with friends/family visiting from out of town or if I wanted to celebrate a birthday or such. It is a tad overrated but nonetheless still good."
,,,,,"Every flavor, every ingredient, every nuanced artful combination superb. "
,,,,,"The appetizer grilled figs with prosciutto, arugula, goat cheese and aged balsamic was the winner - every flavor complementary, not too strong, a harmony of textures from the delicate warm figs to the creamy goat cheese was outstandingly good. "
,,,,,The drink special mocktail with lime and basil and was surprisingly refreshing and helped bring out the flavors in the meal. 
,,,,,"The squid-ink spaghetti with prawns and cauliflower had beautiful subtle seafood flavors without pungency, the prawns were hot and flavorful. "
,,,,,The poached cherries with mascarpone and honey was a perfect small dessert with rich flavors and a nice firm consistency of mascarpone and frightfully strong flavor in the honey. 
,,,,,"Every dish was balanced, flavorful, and a nice modest portion size. "
,,,,,"The decor was reserved but quirky, with pyramids of stacked garlic adorned with stuffed blackbirds, a sad clown on a windowsill, and a beaded curtain behind the hostess. "
,,,,,"Staff were presentable, energetic, welcoming, and attentive. "
,,,,,"For a restaurant that's been a Seattle tradition for decades, I was impressed at the commitment to detail at every level."
,,,,,"I was so excited to come to the restaurant and it exceeded expectations! We squeezed in a quick lunch visit on our Honeymoon and I'm so glad we did. It was raining all day that day and it was really nice atmosphere to sit out the rain in. The hostess even sat us a nice window seat so that we could look out at the water and Pikes Place while we ate! We both had a seasonal cocktail, which unfortunately I can't remember the names of but I enjoyed mine. My wife said hers was a bit too strong (I gladly drank that one as well). "
,,,,,We ordered oysters to start off with which we never received but honestly once we'd gotten the rest of our meal we were pretty happy they didn't come because we were stuffed. 
,,,,,"I tried the gnocchi with rabbit, my first time ever having rabbit, and it was so delicious and tender, paired with the Parmesan cheese it was perfect. My wife also had a pasta with red sauce (again can't remember the name but it was part of their fall menu), super delicious the sauce was amazing! "
,,,,,In addition we also got one meatball with red sauce to try and the Brussel sprouts. The meatball had me obsessed and wishing that I'd ordered meatballs as my entree. The Brussel sprouts also managed to make an impression on my wife who NEVER eats Brussel sprouts. 
,,,,,"Even though we were stuffed we made room for dessert, I believe we had some sort of maple blondie, it came with a caramel/dolce de leche sauce which was just divine!"
,,,,,Will definitely be booking another reservation when we are back in Seattle.
,,,,,"To no one's surprise, you HAVE to come here if you are in Seattle! This place will knock your socks off! We have been here a couple of times and sat inside as well as out, both were equally comfortable! Our server on our most recent visit, Ryan, was awesome! The food is deeeeelish, no matter what you get! The lasagna is one of their signatures dishes (yum!) but you cannot go wrong with any dish here! I highly recommend desserr, we had the seasonal pumpkin blondie and it rocked, along with our espresso martinis. Reservations open up online 30 days in advance, you can't get in without one usually! As in most of Seattle at the moment, vax cards +ids and masks are required."
,,,,,Really really great!
,,,,,"The proof of vaccination was extremely straightforward and easy. The seating was nice and ambient, the bread they provided was crisp and nice! I really like the olive oil blend they use for the bread as well. "
,,,,,"We sat in the outside area which got lots of great music and flows from the live entertainment. The lighting was also really cute since it made all of our dishes look pink (see below!) The pink lemonade was so pretty under the light. The clam linguini also had a ton of clams and it tasted amazing! We also got the lasagna and fish of the day and both of those were amazing. That day, the fish of the day was conveniently salmon, which my partner raved over, and it was priced fairly at MSRP! The tea was also fragrant and it was overall a great experience. "
,,,,,"Our waitress was awesome too! She checked up on us, gave us bread refills, and was nice enough to take a picture of us at the end!"
,,,,,"Had an amazing time here. Went for lunch on a Friday. Had to make a reservation super far in advance and could only get this one, not even dinner! "
,,,,,"The food is excellent excellent excellent. Their started bread was soft and crunchy at the same time, and good olive oil. Absolutely legendary fries. Everything we got was fresh and tasty. Great service as well. The outdoor patio is super cute."
,,,,,Came here right at 5pm on a thursday without a reservation and was able to get seated right after the people reservations.  We made sure to call in the afternoon to see if they were accepting walkins for dinner. The staff told us to come right at 5pm and wait inline. 
,,,,,"We ordered the seafood cioppino and the pink door lasagna. The lasagna was recommended by the server which was definitely a solid choice. The noodles were super thin and delicious while the pesto sauce wasn't too heavy. Additionally, the lasagna is vegetarian so for your veggie friends the menu is friendly! We thought the seafood dish was just okay, thinking it could have been a tad spicier. One thing we noticed was the muscles tasted a bit pungent but the other seafood tasted great. The shrimps were juicy and the clams were meaty. Surprisingly we thought the bread and olive oil stole the show. The olive oil was nutty and had great flavor while the bread had a nice crunchy crust."
,,,,,"Wow, we really enjoyed our dining experience here! There's a lot of hype around The Pink Door, and reservation availability is scarce, and for good reason. Here are a few:"
,,,,,"The food: We asked our server about her favorite dishes, and everything hit the spot. We *cleaned our plates* (sauce and all!) of the arancini, garlic bread, parpadelle, and lasagna dishes. We indulged and got two desserts, the bourbon boudin (a sort of pudding) and ricotta doughnuts -- my favorite! "
,,,,,"The entertainment & ambiance: We were originally sat in the back of the restaurant with a view of the Ferris wheel, it was lovely but we wanted a livelier vibe. We're grateful that the hostess was so accommodating of our request to sit in the main room. Luckily there was a table for 2 right in front of the live jazz band. We caught the last hour of their 3-hour set, and they were amazing. There's really nothing better than eating delicious food while listening to live music. "
,,,,,"Service: From the hostess, to our server and the supporting staff, everyone was attentive and knowledgeable. "
,,,,,"Scoring a reservation here is difficult, but so worth it! Highly recommend coming on a night when there's entertainment."
,,,,,"I love how eclectic this place this! First time I was here for brunch (pre-covid), it was dark, atmospheric, and there were aerobatic dancers doing their thing. This time was a bit more chill, with outdoor seating to soak in the rare Seattle sun. I grabbed a bar seat this time so that I wouldn't have to wait 1+hr. "
,,,,,Got the roast figs and Penn Clove clams & mussels. Both were delicious! 
,,,,,"The figs were on the pricier side ($16 for 3), but I was feeling fancy and can't resist figs. They were roasted perfect, just so they're a little jammy. Came with prosciutto, goat cheese, and arugula. It was a perfect midday treat. "
,,,,,"The clams and mussels were very flavorful with a light broth. Cooked well, though the sauce isn't the most amazing I've ever had. "
,,,,,Such a fun place to go and get some good food! Even better if you can catch some of the live entertainment.
,,,,,1919 Post Alley
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Hm, am I missing something here? I thought the food was just okay but the line we waited in definitely said otherwise. "
,,,,,"My friend and I didn't have reservations but we showed up to the restaurant about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a line that was formed. The hostess was outside checking vaccination cards as well. There was one line for those with reservations and the other for those without. After opening, we were able to be seated within 5 minutes after those with reservations were seated. "
,,,,,My friend and I ordered the mocktail of the day... I don't really remember it so that doesn't say much for it. We ordered the linguine alle vongole and the mussels and clams. Yes... lots of clams for this meal. 
,,,,,"- Linguine was bland, clams were okay and small "
,,,,,"- Mussels and clams, better than the linguine. More savory sauce and the garlic bread that came with it was the best part of the meal. "
,,,,,"I have no regrets going here, but I definitely would've preferred going somewhere else in pike place market! Good to know for next time."
,,,,,"Holistically, this is a gem of a place. You can tell they care about not only the staff, but also the customers especially now during COVID. The fact that they require vaccination cards and check your ID shows that they lean towards being safer than sorry for all. Erring on the side of caution is amazing and leads to a great experience without worry. Whether or not you agree doesn't really matter as the consideration showcases high effort."
,,,,,"Interior is beautiful, tons of mirrors and overall an amazing atmosphere. Slight European interior design sets the mood and tone. However, the outdoor seating is nothing to laugh at either. The sights of the waterfront and Pike are beautiful too. The setting is just perfect for any occasion and wherever you choose to eat (or whatever is available) will enhance the experience altogether."
,,,,,"Lasagna Pink Door - great taste that surprised me. More of a vegetarian option without meat but a strong choice nonetheless. With that in mind, I wish there was a similar option with meat, but no complaints other than that. Great safe choice, hence ""Pink Door"" in the name."
,,,,,"Linguine Alle Vongole - loads of clams on top of linguini with bacon. While a pasta dish, was not quite what I expected during my cravings for Italian. The clams are amazing and fresh, which is to be expected from Pike Place, home to some of the finest clam chowder. I'd prefer other options when craving Italian, though, but would not discount this menu item. "
,,,,,"La Fettunta - decent bread. It wasn't really garlic bread, however. Grilled bread with olive oil is extremely accurate, but expected some garlic? Pair this with something like the lasagna though, and you got yourself a great combination. Clean up your meal with this and honestly, not bad. Would prefer to try other items before ordering this again though."
,,,,,"I do wish there were more options, especially with pasta, but I am satisfied with what's available."
,,,,,"The Pink Door is one of the best hidden gems in downtown Seattle! It's not such a secret because it's quite hard to get a reservation here in short notice, but when you do, it's soooo worth it. We snagged a 2pm reservation & so happy we got an early spot because we were so full after!  "
,,,,,"The Pink Door tucked in Post Alley outside Pike's market, and it looks tiny from the outside. The pink door is inviting, and when you walk in, it's so much bigger than you'd expect! The tables by the window have nice Puget Sound views too; hopefully you'll be lucky enough to get one of those :) "
,,,,,"The food & service were top notch!  Our server was incredibly sweet & so knowledgeable about every little thing in each dish - including the wines.  We ordered a red blend from Stevens 42, a local winery in Washington.. it was divine! I loved the little bit of history our server shared with us about the couple that owns the winery too.. made it feel more special & at home."
,,,,,"For the foods, they bring complimentary infused olive oil & warm local sourdough to get started. We ordered a half order of the antipasto & it was huge! My favorites on it were the tapenade & roasted veggies, but Joey loved the salami & prosciutto. For entrees, I ordered the pasta bolognese- the noodles were just perfectly al dente & the sauce was so hearty. Joey ordered the meatballs & rigatoni, and the sauce was a little different than mine but also delicious! The meatballs were huge but well prepared too.  We were too full for dessert but I'm sure they were delicious too!"
,,,,,"All in all, our experience at The Pink Door was one of my favorites in Seattle. The service, the wine, the food were all impeccable... not sure what more could have been better, actually.  I'll definitely be back & hope you will give this place a try!!"
,,,,,"I had a reservation here since the restaurant was always booked and it has been on my to-go places in Seattle. This is also a good date spot if anyone is looking for a nice place to go hehe. The setup of the restaurant is quite classy with the high ceilings, chandeliers, and candles on our table. We sat next to the window so we were able to get a view of the Ferris wheel at Pike's."
,,,,,"The restaurant takes their COVID protocols pretty seriously because we would not be able to enter unless we have proof of vaccination/negative covid test. Service was good too, thanks to our awesome server. "
,,,,,We got the linguine alle vongole (the clams pasta) which was very flavorful and yummy.  I do recommend it :) We also got the cioppino pink door which I was not a big fan of. It was bland and most of the mussels didn't have any mussels in it (it was just shells). As shown in the picture they didn't give us a lot or the plate just didn't look full. Did I mention they give us complimentary bread? The bread was p good w the pasta sauce haha!!
,,,,,"Overall, I had a pretty good experience, the food was good. It was not the best Italian food I ever had but I would still give it a try. :)"
,,,,,"I'll be honest, I was REALLY disappointed with this place. I'd heard of it for ages and the reviews were all phenomenal, but the dishes we got were pretty average for Italian food. If you're looking for good pasta in the area, I'd recommend Buca di Beppo instead."
,,,,,"The ambiance of the place was really cute and felt European, I just wish the food itself fit the vibe. The rigatoni with meatballs was underwhelming, the marinara wasn't even as good as Trader Joe's marinara sauce. The squid ink was spaghetti had a good, umami-esque flavor though. "
,,,,,"Overall, I feel like it was too pricy for what they gave. I didn't even pack my leftovers. Good to go at least once because it's a very cozy vibe, but I wouldn't return for the food."
,,,,,"Here comes a really long in-depth review of one of the best food experiences I've had not just in Seattle, but throughout most of my Italian food experiences, Pink Door is one to remember."
,,,,,"Ambiance and Decor: I went with someone from France and he said ""the decor here is more French then some restaurants in France."" Basically, Pink Door really got it right. You wouldn't expect it with the kind of underground entry they have, but the indoor dining experience they had was gorgeous, with beautiful views of Pikes Place. "
,,,,,~ let's start talking food ~
,,,,,"Appetizers: the Tuscan fries with aioli might have been my favorite but the bruschetta and caprese had the most flavorful and fresh, vine ripe tomatoes that made even the simplest of dishes, extraordinary."
,,,,,"Dinner: we ordered the vegetarian lasagna which was by far the standout. Spinach noodles, beschamel sauce, and marinara all stacked perfectly. The serving sizes were just right. The gnocchi was also excellent and I loved the fresh peas and mushrooms. The risotto was incredible, super creamy and fresh with veggies that were high quality. "
,,,,,Dessert: the brownie sundae was so decadent and deserves its own review to be honest. The caramel sauce paired really well with the whole thing. The gelato trio was nice and Light but a perfect way to end the meal. The basil cake definitely reminded me of pesto but it's complex flavor palette is a definite must try for any foodie. 
,,,,,"The cocktails were also delicious and I highly recommend it, or a nice wine could pair well with the food too! "
,,,,,Definitely would come back for a special occasion. The hype here is real.
,,,,,My husband and I went here for our anniversary/New Year's Eve and the food was amazing and the energy of the restaurant was awesome definitely a place to recommend.
,,,,,Delizioso! Wonderful staff and great atmosphere!!! You've got to try it. You won't be disappointed!
,,,,,"Such a great hidden gem.  The lamb shank was fantastic! Great service, such a cute restaurant, great views.  We were there for lunch and want to go back for dinner.  It must look even better at night and the food was great.  Really good experience overall but plan well in advance and make a reservation."
,,,,,This cute spot is a must when visiting Seattle. Our first time here was great! We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived. 
,,,,,"The linguine alle vongole is a must try! 10/10. The clams were delicious and the portion size was perfect. We also got the lasagna which was tasty, and fresh oysters. The salt that came with the oysters was interesting, and when sprinkled on top, took the flavors up a notch. "
,,,,,"The service was also great, and the interior is beautiful. If you're lucky enough to be seated by the windows, the view is gorgeous."

,,,,,"The Pink Door is a staple when I visit Seattle. My dad has been taking me since forever and he loves it as well. Nestled into an alleyway near Pike Place, this spot has some of the best italian food I've had in Seattle."
,,,,,Oysters- so fresh 5/5
,,,,,Risotto - very creamy and hearty (perfect for seattle rain) 5/5 
,,,,,Charcuterie - well portioned and the meats are great! My dad loves this more than me however 4/5
,,,,,TLDR: Pink Door is a must visit if you're in the area!
,,,,,"Pink Door is one of those places that lives up to the hype. I've been here on more than one occasion, and it's been a great experience every time. "
,,,,,"Tonight my family and I went to celebrate a couple of birthdays. Although we didnt have a reservation, we arrived a bit after they opened and they were able to seat us pretty quickly (which is pretty impressive for a party of 7). "
,,,,,They just rolled out their winter menu. Here's what we got:
,,,,,- ARANCINI (9/10): these little rice balls are incredible. These were filled with lamb and were perfection. Love that the marinara they serve it with has a little spice to it. My only gripe with this is it's a bit pricy for three per serving. 
,,,,,- MUSHROOM CROSTINI (7.5/10): these were delightful but the bread became a little soggy. Otherwise it was a great appetizer. 
,,,,,- SALUMI PLATTER (8/10): the gnocco fritto that comes with this is SO good. It's an interesting fried dough that's used to scoop up the market cheese. I wish the cheese that came with it was different (it had the taste and consistency of sour cream). 
,,,,,"- OYSTERS (10/10): if you like raw PNW oysters, get it here! The granita they serve it with adds a perfect balance."
,,,,,- PAPPARDELLE AL RAGU BOLOGNESE (10/10): who doesn't love a good parppadelle pasta smothered in ragu?! The pasta is fresh and the sauce is perfect. It's not excessively heavy and quite enjoyable. 
,,,,,"- BRAISED LAMB SHANK (10/10): whew, this one was the star of the show for me. It's a super soft lamb shank over a bed of polenta. I'm drooling thinking about it. "
,,,,,"- RIGATONI AND MAMA'S MEATBALLS (8/10): these are some pretty dang good meatballs. For the simplicity of the dish, it's very tasty. There's just so many great things on the menu that it's hard for this one to shine through. "
,,,,,"- ESPRESSO CHEESECAKE (10/10): I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but this one knocked it out of the park. It was the perfect balance of coffee, chocolate, and sweetness. Definitely not for those who don't enjoy the flavor of coffee. "
,,,,,- ZEPPOLE (10/10): These pillowy delights were delicious. Reminded us of malasadas from hawaii but a tad airier. 
,,,,,"Needless to say, our dinner was fabulous. And our server Dillion was amazing! He checked on us just the right amount of times and was absolutely fabulous. The bussers were also on top of it with promptly clearing the tables and refilling our waters."
,,,,,"Worth the hype. Amazing food, good service, nice views (and can I say very aesthetic decor)! The food is on the pricier side but this place looks like it's gonna be expensive but wasn't as expensive as this place looks ! "
,,,,,Antipasto 9/10 (we cleaned the plate so you know it's good)
,,,,,Lasagna 10/10 (smaller portion but I love how creamy it is and how well the pesto goes with the dish) 
,,,,,Linguine 6.5/10 (great presentation and fresh clams but the linguine didn't take in much flavor cuz the sauce was too watery)
,,,,,Butterscotch budino 9/10 (on the sweeter side)
,,,,,Definitely a not-so-hidden gem of Seattle! It is located in Pike's so good luck finding parking but well worth it. 
,,,,,"Location: The location itself is easy to miss as there's not much signage. Additionally, the stairs descending from the door down to the dining doesn't seem very accessible for those with mobility issues. We went around 12 (they open at 11:30) on a Saturday and still had tables for walk ins. "
,,,,,"Food: We had the the lamb shank on top of creamy polenta ($29) and of course, the linguine alle vongole ($22). Both dishes were absolutely delicious! The serving of lamb was very large and the linguine was average but filled with plenty of clams. The pricing was very good for the quality of food, service, and location! The table next to us had the Tuscan fries and they looked amazing. "
,,,,,Service: Service was prompt and the waiter came to check on us multiple times. 
,,,,,Overall a spectacular experience and can't wait to come back at night for some live entertainment and to try the fries!
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I are visiting Seattle and we wanted to eat at a nice Italian restaurant, to which we have come across The Pink Door in our search."
,,,,,"The atmosphere was amazing! It was very cozy inside, the waiters/waitresses were all very friendly with prompt service, and the performances we came across were great! "
,,,,,"We first ordered two drinks, a seasonal mocktail and a camperol+soda. These were very well made and tasted delicious, with multiple layers of flavors in the mocktail and perfect balance in the camperol+soda, which came with a complementing orange flavor."
,,,,,"However, the main thing we care about is the food. We first started with the arancini, the fried rice balls with lamb ragout and fontina cheese inside with a surrounding heirloom tomato pureé. This was decent, with the balls tasting  very hearty and delicious. However, there was not enough of the tomato sauce and its acidity to cut through all of the fat and heartiness."
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I shared two entreés - the rigatoni and mama's meatballs, and the tortelli en brodo. This is where we manly deducted our points. First, the rigatoni itself was not al dente - it was too soft. Furthermore, the ""mama's meatballs"" were certainly not something I would put under any true Italian mom - they were well cooked, but very underseasoned. Next, with the tortelli en brodo, the broth was perfect for a winter day, full of flavor. The tortelli was decent, with a nice meat filling, but I just cannot justify paying $26 for 8 small tortelli. "
,,,,,"Overall, our three stars are from the: 1) atmosphere, 2) drinks, 3) service"
,,,,,"I was having a conversation with friends a couple weeks ago about different good restaurants downtown and I mentioned that for some reason The Pink Door doesn't always come to mind as an option, but when it does, I almost always choose it. Every time I eat here I end up telling at least one person: ""We should eat at The Pink Door more often"". As soon as I mentioned The Pink Door everyone else's eyes lit up and the room was filled with exclamations of ""I love The Pink Door"". I was so glad that I had thought of it so I could book my upcoming birthday dinner there a week later, and I have to say, even with all that excitement and expectation, they still managed to blow me out of the water."
,,,,,"Fantastic food (Arancini, Tuna Crudo, Bolognese = delicious) and cocktails in a really cool environment."
,,,,,I've been wanting to try the Pink Door for some time and it did not disappoint.  The atmosphere was welcoming and really cool - and the service was wonderful. 
,,,,,"It was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  We started with the bruschetta, which had thick whole tomato's on top of crusty bread - and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  "
,,,,,"I had the first of the day, the Alaskan Halibut. It was cooked perfectly. It was moist and flavorful - with sliced leeks and artichokes in a light buttery broth. The fish was topped with an olive medley. It was layer upon layer of flavor throughout.  Just incredible. "
,,,,,"Sarah had the vegetarian  lasagna, which was also incredible. It was baked with a béchamel cream. It wasn't heavy, but rather light. She thoroughly enjoyed it!"
,,,,, This place exceeded our expectations. We will be back for sure.
,,,,,I can't wait to come back here again!
,,,,,"What a great location, beautiful decor inside, and lots of outdoor seating with lavender plants and a great view. If your looking for a lovely causal place to have lunch and dinner with your friends, family, or even by yourself- then this is your spot in the Pike's Market area!!!"
,,,,,We got reservations for lunch (highly recommend getting reservations as it is a very popular spot). It took us a few times to find the restaurant- but you want to look for the light pink door on Post Alley. 
,,,,,We had the squid ink pasta and the meatball panini for lunch. Delicious. They have a large selection of drinks as well. Just great pasta and Italian food.
,,,,,One of the best experiences in Seattle. 
,,,,,"When you can impress a 9 yr old and his parents all at the same time with excellent service, amazing food... That's amazing"
,,,,,"We are in love with the gnocchi, the clams/mussels, the garlic bread, and phenomenal and rare, vegetarian lasagna! "
,,,,,It's not easy to get everything right but you did. 
,,,,,Be sure to make reservations though.... All good things take time
,,,,,"I'm never one to pick Italian for lunch or dinner. But this, this right here?? YES! Everything was sooo delicious, even the Cesar salad. Dressing was so bright, perfect amount of saltiness from anchovies. Romaine was fresh and crisp, and house made croutons, to die for. The antipasti had a variety to mix and match, also a must for starters. "
,,,,,"My favorite has to be the lasagna. I have never had pasta cooked to perfection, and the sauce was a perfect ratio. Not too cheesy, not too saucy, just perfection baked TO PERFECTION. And Branzino, grilled whole, the char brought out it's flavor. Served with beans, and even the beans were cooked perfectly. The green sauce paired with it just brightens up the dish to a whole other level. "
,,,,,"The cioppino had lots of flavor but i think can use just a dash more salt. The seafood flavors were definitely there, but that dash of salt would've helped bring everything together for that UMPH! "
,,,,,"The location of this restaurant is in a alley, no signs on the outside, but literally a pink door. If directions are telling you that you're there, just look for a pink door. You will not be disappointed."

,,,,,"The Pink Door was on my list of restaurants to try on our visit to Seattle. And thanks to yelp reviews, I knew what I was going to order. The Pink Door lasagne. Exceptionally good and vegetarian! Very hard to find such a combo in lasagne. "
,,,,,"But the surprise (in a good way) was the potato gnocchi. We asked if it could be made vegetarian by removing the meat and the chef agreed! What arrived was different from the menu, the sauce was tangy and delicious. So good that we ordered a second. The amusing part was that the next time what arrived had a totally different sauce, leaving us confused and requesting for what we had previously.  Our server was really nice and accommodated our request. I see now why The Pink Door is highly rated and recommend this place if you're looking for some good italian food in Seattle. The ambience cozy with a stage in the corner and there's also a vespa on display!"
,,,,,"A VERY hyped-up restaurant near Pike Place. It's so hyped, in fact, that reservations are very hard to get. The ambiance is great. This is definitely a date night spot. Views from the back dining room are nice, even at night. It's overpriced for what you get, though. My husband loved his steak with parsnip purée and Brussels sprouts, but it wasn't better tasting than the steak he cooks himself. I ordered the seasonal tortelli en brodo (in broth) which was tasty, but paying $26 for EIGHT tortellis is silly and gave me flashbacks to a pretentious, overpriced Italian spot in Claremont. And the worst part? I saw it coming. Right down to the exact number of tortellis. Still, it seemed a bit different than the rigatoni and meatballs and pappardelle with ragu, which is what we usually order for Italian. The bread is complementary and fluffy, but served cold. What? "
,,,,,"Hands down, the highlight of The Pink Door was the ambience. The food was decent, but not outstanding, especially for the price. At least we crossed one more touristy thing off of our list."
,,,,,"Let me start with the drinks! The Espresso Martinis and ""Gingerly Made"" cocktails were fantastic. We all enjoyed our drinks. And the garlic bread, Caesar salad with dungeness crab, and grilled raddiccio were also very good. "
,,,,,"I really liked the clam linguine and lasagna, but I didn't care for the pappardelle pasta. The gnocchi was alright, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The clam linguine and lasagna flavors stood out to me most, although others at the table had different favorites. "
,,,,,"And what a fun theme for a restaurant! I couldn't stop staring at the birds, and I thought the wall of mirrors was really cute. "
,,,,,"Service was excellent. We walked in for lunch with a party of 4 on a Thursday afternoon, and we were seated right away. Our waiter was really attentive and the food arrived at a good pace. Never waited long or had to ask for help, but we also didn't feel rushed."
,,,,,"The Pink Door is one of the final highly-touted eateries in Seattle my wife and I had yet to try since moving here so we were excited to give it a go. When you enter, the place is fairly loud and bustling with a very eclectic feel that might also come across as somewhat garish. The tables are set with paper covers to the cloth tablecloths which really downgrades the quality of the experience but is also a somewhat understandable due to their turnover and popularity. Unfortunately for me, I was also greeted by a lipstick-stained glass and, sadly, the pink wasn't really my color. The staff was quick to replace it at least. "
,,,,,"We started with the La Fettunta which was absolutely fantastic. When ordering, I didn't actually know they had ""house"" bread served to the tables but am glad I did it anyway in the end. It's labeled on the menu as having the ""finest olive oils"" which we kind of laughed at until we received the house bread and oil to go with our meal... that olive oil was decidedly *not* the finest. It pales in comparison to a level where it's honestly hard to eat alongside the La Fettunta. "
,,,,,For our mains we tried the spinach lasagna and rabbit gnocchi. The lasagna was somewhat under-seasoned (really needed at least some salt) and was definitely a smaller portion than necessary to be filling but was otherwise good. The gnocchi came without complaint. To finish we shared a pumpkin brownie which was good but nothing that particularly wowed us. 
,,,,,As a note about the trapeze/entertainment element advertised here: less than half of the seating actually has a view of the area this occurs in and when making a reservation you probably wouldn't have known that unless you had some prior experience with the place. The entertainment each night is enjoyed by only a small percentage of patrons and should probably not be a consideration when choosing this restaurant. The views of Pike Place and Elliott Bay were also not available to us where we sat so it's best to assume The Pink Door is just a place to eat unless you specifically request otherwise.
,,,,,The service is great. Food is excellent. Pasta and lasagna is always fresh and amazing. Atmosphere is fun and casual. Music was good. We enjoy every time! Good for date nights or girls night out.
,,,,,"The place is super charming, it has special events but it's all by reservations, weeks in advance. It has two seating areas, one is the dinning like any other restaurant, and then it has the cabaret type. The dinning area has seating with view of the waterfront. Very rustic and appealing look. My server Krista was very nice and polite. They have a full on alcohol menu including bourbon, whiskey, brandy, amongst others, they do cocktails and wines (both national and Italian) by the glass, half or full bottle. The menu is very italian (pasta, risotto, Insalate, I had the Bruschetta and the Risotto and it was super fresh and tasty. Prices are average similar to all the places around between $15-30 for the most expensive dishes."
,,,,,Right now they are requiring proof of vaccination plus ID check
,,,,,"Definitely dine at the Pink Door while in Seattle. The atmosphere is so unique, food is delicious, and service is excellent. "
,,,,,"Complimentary bread was so good, but the olive oil that came with the bread was literally next level--it tasted so fresh like real fresh olives, I don't know how to describe it. Best app: salumi platter, hands down, the different cheeses, meats, and tomato jam worked so well together. I also tried the squid ink pasta and it was SO delicious. Best squid ink pasta I've ever eaten. Wish I could make it at home. "
,,,,,"Prices are reasonable, and the selection of wine is also excellent. The Pink Door was definitely my favorite place to eat in Seattle."
,,,,,Amazing! As soon as you step inside it's a completely different vibe. Jazz music playing and everyone dressed up. The food was so good I forgot to take pictures. They give you complementary bread and the slices are freaking huge! The portions aren't huge but they are filling. They even took our picture with a Polaroid on the way out.  We had an amazing valentines night and will be back.
,,,,,"Dined here for our anniversary. Romantic setting, spacious seating arrangements, fabulous service and quality Italian inspired dishes. We highly recommend the arancini."
,,,,,Had such a great time here + would love to return on a future trip to Seattle!
,,,,,"We did a walk-in without a reservation on a Friday night and put our name down around 7:50pm, and we ended up being seated around 9pm. We walked around Pike Place Market / the waterfront while we waited."
,,,,,"We didn't get a table by the water (totally fine, it was really dark outside anyway) but sat right by the live music - it was amazing and really set the right mood for our dinner! The decor inside is also really cool and overall, we loved the vibes/ambiance."
,,,,,"Food: our group ordered the arancini, lasagna, gnocchi w/ rabbit, and risotto and I particularly loved the gnocchi I ordered. Also! The waiter brought us bread with amazing (garlic?) infused olive oil and I'm still thinking about it now. "
,,,,,Highly recommend including Pink Door on a Seattle itinerary and making a reservation - I'm grateful we were able to stop by without one!

,,,,,"I visited Seattle and had The Pink Door on my to do's list. At first I was afraid it would be closed, but upon searching for a reservation I was able to book for dinner for the next night. Upon entering, you are asked for your COVID Vaccine Card and ID and waiter walks you to your table. "
,,,,,My group was sitted next to the glass window over looking the water and great Seattle wheel. This place is full of Ambiance and vintage art. Very Chic and Pretty. Waitress did a great job at explaining the menue and drinks. 
,,,,,Food was very tasty! I chose the fish of the day/ Chefs dish of the day. Highly recommend although I do not remember what it's call and sadly I didn't take a picture. I was enjoying it that much. It was a salsa verde (pesto with Brussels sprouts and white grilled fish) 
,,,,,Defiently a place to stop by on your Seattle list! I would only return for special occasions.
,,,,,Glad we were able to dine at The Pink Door. 
,,,,,TIP: You need your COVID  vaccination card to dine here. 
,,,,,We flew into Seattle and made our way to The Pink Door. I didn't realize it was located by the 1st Starbucks and Pike Market area. Entrance is on the alley side and you'll see bars etc. 
,,,,,"After showing proof of vaccination,  we sat at the bar for our table. There was live music and we loved listening to them play. "
,,,,,"The bartender was very nice and we had an old fashioned and glass of wine. When our table was ready, the hostess took us to what looked like the back of the restaurant that overlooked the street side. It gave us a view of the ferris wheel. "
,,,,,Our server was very nice but I completely forgot his name. 
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,Ahi Tuna Crudo- delicious 
,,,,,Flank Steak - Not a fan
,,,,,Lasagna- SPINACH PASTA and so good.
,,,,,Complimentary Foccacia Bread (The Best I've ever had)
,,,,,"Overall, the food was amazing. I loved everything about this restaurant and the vibe. "
,,,,,Definitely would return when I visit.
,,,,,"Delicious dinner at The Pink Door. We made a reservation and had to show our proof of vaccination and ID in order to get into the establishment. Upon entering, we were greeted and brought to our patio table. The entertainment of the night was a jazz ensemble; unfortunately, because we were seated outdoors, we missed out on the lovely jazz played by wonderful musicians and only caught part of the jazziness on our way in and out of the restaurant."
,,,,,"The menu consists of different pasta and food items, including squid ink pasta, salmon, etc. We loved everything that we ordered!"
,,,,,"I had such a good experience at The Pink Door. From when I checked in to when I signed the bill, the service was personal and professional. The decor of the place is quirky but so cute and romantic. I got to sit in the dining room with the waterfront view and it was stunning. "
,,,,,I had a delicious chilled rosemary gimlet and oysters to start. I could've eaten way more of the ousters - they were so tasty! I had the Branzino style white fish of the day (can't remember exactly what the fish was) and it exceeded my expectations. The portion was probably enough for two people and I was bummed that I couldn't finish it. The beans and green sauce that came with it really complimented the fish well. 
,,,,,I didn't get a dessert because I was so full but the desserts at the table next to me looked great. 
,,,,,I would love to come back to The Pink Door and try some of their pasta dishes!
,,,,,A big thank you to my sweet waitress who made me feel so comfortable dining there alone.
,,,,,Came here a few times. I just can't say no to good food
,,,,,We had the
,,,,,AHI TUNA CRUDO  
,,,,,"fried capers, smoked castelvetrano olives, microgreens, orange citrus vinaigrette"
,,,,,LASAGNA PINK DOOR
,,,,,"fresh spinach pasta layered with besciamella, pesto and topped with marinara sauce"
,,,,,PAPPARDELLE AL RAGÙ BOLOGNESE
,,,,,"slow-simmered meat sauce,  fresh pasta"
,,,,,"Walk through the Pink Door, and you'll experience a delicious meal with amazing live entertainment! "
,,,,,"I made dinner reservations for my boyfriend and me since we have been wanting to eat here for awhile now! To be honest, I had no idea what to expect, all I knew was that Pink Door was one of the must-try places in Seattle. I  think we came around 7ish pm and we were able to catch a part of a live acrobatic show, which was totally unexpected and cool! "
,,,,,"The ambiance is romantic - slightly dark inside with vintage mirrors and pieces on thee walls. When I came here, it was also decorated with Christmas trees and lights for the holidays."
,,,,,"I was looking forward to trying their squid ink pasta ( I saw some photos on Yelp ), but it's no longer on the menu. I'm not sure if the menu rotates! Here is what my bf and I ordered:"
,,,,,"Pappardelle al ragù bolognese: Fresh, housemate pasta, topped with a delicious tomato meat sauce and Parmesan cheese. Sounds simple but it tasted flavorful and delicious! Favorite dish of the night."
,,,,,"Risotto: This has Italian sausage, rosemary, and radicchio. My bf liked the dish, but I learned that I don't really like radicchio. It made the dish hard to eat because it was a bit bitter for me. The risotto was also not as creamy as I would have liked it to be. Overall, it was okay for me, but still recommend if you have a different taste than me! "
,,,,,I'm hoping to come back soon to try more of their dishes.
,,,,,"Normally I don't eat out at Italian restaurants but I've been interested in trying this place since it's so hard to snag a reservation. Was able to get one the week of on a Thursday at lunch time. I came here with a friend and the process of getting in and getting seated was simple, and they check your vaccination status! "
,,,,,"We ordered the brussels sprouts, linguine alle vongolle, and the lasagna. The brussel sprouts were amazing with a lot of flavor, and I LOVED the lasagna. It's not normally my go to for eating out, but it was so delicious and creamy and flavorful. We tried the linguine alle vongolle since it seems to be a favorite. Honestly I just thought it was okay, and I get annoyed picking the clams out of every shell tbh lol. "
,,,,,"It looks like they have live entertainment in the evenings. The decor is super funky and fun to look at. Service was average but they are quick to refill your waters, but the restaurant wasn't super busy when we went!"
,,,,,Came here on our first night flying into Seattle! Had no reservations and was told the wait is about an hour. No problem :) my boyfriend and I were able to walk around Pike's at night when the crowd was gone and just enjoy the scenery at night. About 45-50 minutes we received a text that our table is ready! The check for vaccination cards! 
,,,,, 
,,,,,"There was live music and it was pretty loud if you're seated in the front of the restaurant, but lucky my bf and I was seated in the back room and there was a view of Seattle. Beautiful and romantic interior as well. Our waitress was so sweet and helpful, the food was delicious and yummy. "
,,,,,Arancini 5/5
,,,,,Soooooo good! The sauce had a kick to it as it was hot and cheesy! Definitely use your bread to get every last bit of the marinara sauce! 
,,,,,Linguine Alle Vongole 5/5
,,,,,Plenty of clams and pasta to fill you up! There was also lots of sauce after that you can dip your bread into! 
,,,,,Potato Gnocchi 3/5
,,,,,"Not my personal favorite since I don't like pomegranate seeds, but my bf enjoyed it"
,,,,,Great service and definitely would come back again!
,,,,,"What a cute spot in Seattle very close to all the hustle and bustle of things. The restaurant is very antique with lots of decorations, many mirrors on the walls, and statues. We got seated next to a window with great views of Seattle. "
,,,,,"I would 100% recommend the bolognese it was the best I've tasted, noodles are so wide with great texture and the sauce was amazing. This was my favorite dish. We also got the linguini pasta which they were very generous with the oysters. Also amazing service, very attentive."
,,,,,Okay I've been trying to go to Pink Door for quite a while and THANK GOD I finally tried it.
,,,,,"Fair warning: this place get's completely reserved, so either look for one ASAP, or do a walk in for an early dinner. We chose the latter and ate around 5:30-5:45 pm with no wait at all. "
,,,,,Food: ughhh it's soooo good. Take me back please! I got the squid ink pasta and it was incredible. The pasta was perfect and the seafood was cooked perfectly. We also shared some meatballs which was quite good balls also just meatballs in my opinion. My partner got the lasagna which was excellent with the bechamel sauce. Also bread was FANTASTIC. It was a nice rustic bread and they actually only serve it with olive oil which honestly was perfectly for it. 
,,,,,Ambiance: the ambiance is excellent. It's such a unique decor and they have live music as well. We saw him get to go on around 6:30 pm so we unfortunately missed it. 
,,,,,"Anyways, YOU MUST make your way here."

,,,,,"Tonight was my second time visiting The Pink Door. The first visit over the summer was absolutely magical-- we had reservations and the service was excellent, food was superb, and we sat on the patio with the most gorgeous view. Tonight, I had a friend who'd just relocated to Seattle so I immediately thought of visiting The Pink Door as our dinner destination. Without a reservation, I thought it might be a long shot but we walked in around 7pm and were immediately seated at the bar without any issue. Our bartender, Jäger, was THE BEST. Super personable and provided amazing recommendations along the way. For my main, I had the rigatoni & meatballs (whatever you do, get the meatballs!) and my companion had the Ribeye and both were stellar. For dessert, I had the poached pear which was such a pretty dessert that a man seated nearby asked what it was.  Jäger suggested the perfect dessert wine to go with it. I think it was Ben Ryé. Seriously, try it. To add on top of all this, apparently on Tuesday nights there's an aerialist?! The wins keep coming. My friend had the best night and is super excited about her move here. Mission accomplished."
,,,,,"TL;DR: Food, drinks, and bartender Jäger made this an A+ experience and I can't wait to return!"
,,,,,I came here for a special date night and it didn't disappoint! Fancy decor on the inside and a great view of the water in one of the dining rooms which we were lucky to sit in. 
,,,,,I had the lasagna pink door which was incredibly delicious! It has a mix of pesto and red sauce which sounds questionable in theory but in practice is such a rich and delicious mix! The portion was good too. Not too big but definitely not small. The rigatoni and mama's meatballs was good too. A classic dish with high quality meatballs. I'd choose the lasagna over it though just because I am a big lasagna fan. 
,,,,,I'd love to come back and try the other dishes as well. The risotto would be my next pick!
,,,,,"Great place for a date night! Fresh, delicious seafood dishes and live music. "
,,,,,"I wasn't aware this place needed reservations beforehand, but I was able to get a table for 2 during walk-in. My boyfriend and I ordered the squid ink spaghetti and the linguine alle vongole (pasta with clams). Things are pricier than other places, however the portion sizes are fair and you get a decent amount of seafood. My boyfriend's linguine alle vongole had the same amount of clams as pasta. My favorite part was the live band they had playing. "
,,,,,FYI: They'll check your vaccination and ID card before coming in. Be sure to have those prepared!
,,,,,"We made reservations in advance online, one of our friends stayed up until midnight to snag them when the dates became available. Otherwise, it can be over a 1.5 hour wait if you walk in. We were staying at a nearby hotel and took Uber, but definitely think ahead for parking if you are planning to drive. "
,,,,,The front of the restaurant near the live music was a more casual setting. As you make your way past the bar to the back of the restaurant there is a more intimate dining room with views of the waterfront. The noise level was honestly pretty loud but we loved the design of that seating area. 
,,,,,"Bread is complimentary with a yummy olive oil. We ordered the garlic bread which was almost the same thing- I'd suggest skipping on that because bread is free. Our favorite dish was definitely the Bolognese, it was creamy and flavorful and was so good because of the thick noodles made by scratch. The lasagna is also a must try- it's made with pesto as well which really added to the flavors. For seafood lovers the linguine was also delicious and had a nice spicy kick to it. "
,,,,,We visited for a friends birthday and unfortunately there are no freebie desserts. If you order a dessert however they will light a candle for you. I would definitely come back for the delicious Italian food offered here!
,,,,,Go here for the vibe and stay for the tasty food. 
,,,,,"We FINALLY got Valentine's Day reservations after moving to the city years ago. You can book a month in advance for any day, but do so on the earlier side, because they do and will fill up. Pink door has wonderful live entertainment and the servers are excellent and attentive. The focaccia bread is mouth watering and pairs excellently with an app of meatballs."
,,,,,Worth every penny! Upscale Italian cuisine and fresh seafood! Speakeasy look from the outside with grandiose interior. Great spot for special occasions!
,,,,,"Alissa, our server, was great! I appreciate the wine recommendation and her attentiveness. "
,,,,,Every dish we had tonight were amazing. Literally cannot find a single fault in tonight's experience. 
,,,,,"The most important thing for seafood is freshness, and the fact that they are located right beside a fish market really shows! "
,,,,,Tips:
,,,,,"- for reservation, keep refreshing throughout the day and sometimes an open spot will come up!"
,,,,,"THERE IS A NO PASTA TAKEOUT POLICY which I don't know how long will be enforced but that threw a wrench in our plans to bring back lunch for some relatives who were working. They explained it is for quality control as prior customers complained about one of their lasagnas not having enough sauce. One of the specific Yelp complaints can be found in the one star review section. So I'm not sure why forbid pasta take out entirely instead of just making sure the takeout has more sauce next time. Whether or not I agree with the policy, it would have been nice to know this beforehand written on the menu somewhere as takeout is a fairly common and almost assumed practice in food establishments these days given the pandemic. "
,,,,,Now onto things that we enjoyed: We love the atmosphere of the place! The decor of the restaurant is so effective and beautiful. It is definitely a memorable and awe inducing environment.
,,,,,The staff was very friendly. There was barely any wait time for any of the food. The presentation of the dishes were beautiful. The pesto and tomato sauce lasagna was delicious and one of my favorite dishes there.
,,,,,"Things that were average: We were dissatisfied with the ""garlic bread"" we ordered. It was charred bread with oil and salt, but there was no actual garlic taste anywhere to be found. It tasted good but it was a misleading name. I looked closely at the bread and I don't know where the garlic was. There was no chopped garlic and the oil was not garlic infused. My boyfriend who looves garlic bread was not happy. "
,,,,,"The fries were nicely presented with fried sage leaves and a clove of garlic, but was bland. (The menu does not allow ketchup to be requested). "
,,,,,"The squid ink pasta I've seen in the Yelp profile picture of this restaurant was not on the menu, but the waiter asked the kitchen to make it. The dish was decent, it was tomato sauce and seafood, but not much other noticeable flavors that pair well with seafood like butter or garlic or lemon so I don't think I'd have it again. "
,,,,,I will say the squid tasted fresh. 
,,,,,"Overall I think most of the dishes are average, some were underwhelming, but the atmosphere is the most impressive and memorable to me."
,,,,,"Stroll the west side of Post Alley between Stewart and Virginia until you catch sight of a light pink door amidst grey bricks. Reservations are highly recommended, but walk-ins are an option, too. "
,,,,,"Started off lunch with La Fettuna and it was just about the tastiest garlic bread I've had to date. As for the entrees, both the Pappardelle Al Ragù Bolognese and winter Risotto equally filled my stomach (and heart) with warmth and contentment. Cocktails on the other hand were way sweet for me which means I'll need to opt for the wine next time. "
,,,,,"Whether you choose to dine in the lounge or outside overlooking Elliot Bay, no trip to Seattle is ever complete without stopping by for a memorable time at the Pink Door where you can enjoy delectable, locally sourced Italian-American fare."
,,,,,***3.5 Stars***
,,,,,"Oh yes... it's quite lovely! The Pink Door has been in my bookmarks for quite some time now. On a recent visit to Seattle, I made it a point to finally stop by. Food and ambience-wise, it definitely met my expectations. Service-wise?! Eh... not so much. But, we'll get into that a bit later. "
,,,,,"The Pink Door is a popular Italian resto that's practically hidden within Post Alley. The entrance reminds me of a Speakeasy. Literally. It's just a door with nothing else around it. No windows, no large signs. Easily missed and I passed by it twice before figuring it out. Not sure if this was their objective, but if so, they won. "
,,,,,"Once you make your way in, you'll be met with the dark and sultry tones of their lovely decor. I walked in without a reservation but did call ahead of time to see if they had tables available. They have a beautiful  patio space that overlooks the waterfront. Unfortunately, there was no space on the patio, so I took a seat in the dining room. The setup is so classy. High ceilings with sophisticated chandeliers. I LOVE. And if you're lucky enough to snag a seat by the window, you'll get to have those same beautiful patio views -- but indoors."
,,,,,"All was going well until the server came along. She just didn't seem interested in helping me much at all that evening. Oh, but she was definitely interested in serving the group of 4 young gentleman who sat next to me (they were nice guys, but still). Barely saw the girl. Interaction was minimal and slow at that. I'd usually drop the rating down to a 3 stars with service like this but... everything else was amazing. The food? Absolutely delicious."
,,,,,"Ordered the pappardelle with bolognese and it was divine. Everything from the chewiness of the pasta to the taste of the sauce and the fresh cheese shavings were damn near perf. And the Chianti paired perfectly with it! It really brought out those rich flavors. Homemade pasta for sure. I get what everyone is raving about. And after eating it, it got me thinking that maybe homegirl was just having a bad day. It's no excuse for bad service of course, but sometimes good food will make you reevaluate things. "
,,,,,"Despite the slow and dismissive service, I'd still come back again because I really did enjoy the ambience and the food. But next time, I won't be so lenient when it comes to the service piece."
,,,,,Party of 3 on a Saturday evening.. we waited an hour wait with no reservation. If you can't get a reservation don't let that deter you eating here. We walked around and shopped a little while we waited. The hour flew by and they texted us when the table was ready. 
,,,,,"Food: appetizer we ordered the arancini.. very flavorful! The entrees were: lasagna 10/10 very creamy and you know what.. worth the hype! (I never order lasagna), the linguine alle vongole was predictable as with any seafood linguine, light and well flavored, then the eggplant penne was good. I think it was agreed upon by us 3 that the lasagna was the best. "
,,,,,Dessert: the fall dessert we ordered was the pumpkin pecan brownie with salted caramel ice cream. It was soooooo good! 
,,,,,"Service: service was good, felt a tad bit rushed. Live jazz music till 10pm. All in all the atmosphere sets the mood and with great food and wine list.. it's all worth the wait."

,,,,,"An incredible, wonderful, MUST do stop when you are in seattle! This was my first dinner in Seattle, and boy did they NOT disappoint. "
,,,,,"Our waitress Ashley was nothing short of incredible! She had amazing recommendations, attentive but gave the appropriate amount of privacy and comfort. She never once interrupted us or dropped by mid mouth full haha."
,,,,,"The food here is incredible! I can't speak more highly of everything! We had the Caesar salad, mamas meatballs, lasagna, and the fresh fish of the day! And of course, lots of wine. I enjoyed everything! "
,,,,,"I don't usually like pesto, but i really enjoyed the layer in the lasagna. Truly a treat, and I can't wait to come back to seattle and eat here again"
,,,,,"I cannot say enough great things about this place! Even though The Pink Door is located in a relatively touristy area, don't let that deter you! Once stepping inside, I immediately understood why this place is so popular."
,,,,,"My group of 4 did not have a reservation on a weekend night, however we were able to wait for 2 hours to get a table. The wait was well worth it, and I'm so glad that we were able to dine here. The ambiance was impeccable, there was a live band playing and candles adorning every table. I could see this being a great place for dates, but also to take your family."
,,,,,"Everything we ordered was so fresh and flavorful, from the oysters to the clam pasta. The best dish (even though they were all amazing) was the market fish - it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and came with a delicious mouthwatering pesto that I will never forget. It had a unique, citrusy flavor that complemented the smoky fish."
,,,,,"If I am ever in the area again, this is the first place I will visit! I highly recommend"
,,,,,Wife and I walked in on a Thursday evening excited for our first meal on this Seattle getaway. We couldn't have been more pleased with our experience at The Pink Door. 
,,,,,"They checked and verified everyone's vaccine status at the door, which we welcomed and got accustomed to quickly on our trip. We were sat at the bar and served incredible drinks by the friendly bar staff. Everything from our appetizer to the main course and dessert was incredible. "
,,,,,The Pink Door was the perfect way to start our Seattle trip
,,,,,"Located in a street in pike place, it's not very difficult to find. Just go on google maps to direct you and your party. Shouldn't be any issue. We went on New Year's Eve for lunch and got there around 11:20. There was a line waiting outside but we got seated instantly. They check your ID and COVID card which is ridiculous but policies are policies. If you choose to eat here you follow the rules they have! "
,,,,,"Anyways we got the linguine with clams. Pretty solid, a little light on the flavor but still very good as you can dip the sauce with the bread. 7/10 for us. Got the bolognese as well and that was cooked perfect Al dente. Really rich in flavor and had tons of sauce and Parmesan! Perfect for a cold winter day and just such a hearty meal."
,,,,,Service was excellent and the food came out quick! Would definitely recommend but you are paying premium prices! Good ambiance and very unique decorations! One of a kind in Seattle indeed.
,,,,,"Holy smokes! How lucky could we have been to have a late night supper after a show on Sunday night. The Pink door is always booked way in advance and for good reason. Wonderful ambience, welcoming and professional staff and delicious food. Note that all COVID protocols are followed."
,,,,,Emily guided us through our late night supper. We started with the truffle crostini which was a meal in itself. Rich and very tasty with just the right amount of truffle. 
,,,,,"For our main course, we shared the  Pappardelle in a Bolognese. This reminded us of a comparable dish made by the famous 3 Michelin star chef from Manresa in Los Gatos now Mentone in Aptos. They are now rivals but from what I learned, the grandmother of the owners adds her special touch with the Pink Door. Just awesome."
,,,,,They also have a fabulous wine selection both Italian and domestic.
,,,,,"All of this plus a wonderful atmosphere and a delightfully professional waitperson, Emily, topped off our trip to Seattle. We hope to come back soon with advanced reservations to enjoy more of their menu."
,,,,,"If you can get a reservation, it's definitely a fun experience! Try and get it while they have a performance. "
,,,,,"Food wise: high price for small portions, but I got the gnocchi and it was pretty fantastic! Lots of different flavors coming through in the sauce (if it wasn't a fancy place I would have licked the plate) their online menu isn't up to date either so beware. "
,,,,,Drinks: the seasonal drinks were really good and creative! 
,,,,,"It think my issue was they are checking covid cards at the entrance and wearing masks, but the tables were smushed together. You have to squeeze into the booth pushing Into the other tables. Which was annoying and too close for current conditions."
,,,,,My husband surprised me with a trip to Seattle for my birthday and dinner at the Pink Door.  This restaurant is apparently THE place for special occasion dining so you have to make reservations a few weeks in advance.  It's down an unmarked side street with no sign to let you know where the restaurant is.  There's an open door leading down to the restaurant.  Go there.  I got the lamb shank and my husband got the risotto with sausage(add meatballs).  Our friends got the lamb shank and the cioppino.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  The risotto had a nice chew and good flavor as did the meatballs.  I wish we had gotten appetizers and salad but we were pretty full by the time we were finished with our entrees.  The restaurant has a really cool vibe and a lot of folks were dressed up.  I'd love the chance to come back here again!
,,,,,Easily one of my favorite restaurants that I went to when I visited Seattle!
,,,,,"Came here during an evening after seeing the reviews online and was absolutely blown away with the food. As an appetizer for my party, we decided to get a dozen of oysters to share. The oysters were served on a bed of ice and served with shaved ice vinegar. The oysters themselves were fresh and did not have any sort of fishy taste to them and paired nicely with the the vinegar. If anyone is an oyster fan, I definitely recommend getting some here. As an entrée item I went with the Linguine Alle Vongole after getting recommended it from our server. The amount of clams that it came with was mind-blowing! Each of which was extremely flavorful. I also appreciated the fact that the clams were cleaned thoroughly as some places do a poor job and you get that sandy tasty. The linguine was also cooked nicely and had that perfect pasta consistency. "
,,,,,"I definitely recommend coming here if anyone is touring Seattle! Service is phenomenal, food is great, and the interior is very eclectic. I also appreciated that there was live entertainment in the evening when I dined in. I will definitely be coming back in the future if I ever visit Seattle again."
,,,,,Just getting caught up with overdue reviews of various Seattle eateries I've been to and have enjoyed.  There are several very good Italian restaurants in Seattle and the Pink Door is one of them.
,,,,,"I am originally from Dorchester (OFD) and the North End of Boston has some amazing Italian restaurants.  Difficult to find really good Italian here in Portland although there are a few that I've patronized that are ""ok"".  But I really appreciate authentic Italian cuisine and this can certainly be found here.  Hit the ATM before you show up since it ain't cheap but you get what you pay for.  I have yet to have a meal here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  Seafood (mussels!), pasta, anything with meatballs in it ....yum!"
,,,,,Wait staff is great although none have been Italian speakers so far.  Not that I am fluent but I speak enough to know what I'm ordering.  My best friend in childhood came over on the boat (literally) at a young age and I measure all Italian restaurants based on how they compare to his Mother's meals prepared after spending an entire day preparing it.
,,,,,"Just writing this review makes me wish I was in Seattle as I am getting very hungry.  Pike Place Market is ground zero for gluttons and those in search of a full, happy tummy."
,,,,,"The Pink Door transports you from what feels like ""hm, GPS is telling me to go down this dark, sketchy alley.. will my organs be ok?"" to ""omg, this is pretty cool, I did NOT expect this!"""
,,,,,"The Pink Door (aptly named) is guarded by an employee that verifies your covid-19 vaccination card. Finish this first trial, and you're allowed access down a set of stairs that flow through a lengthy dining room, with a section in the back that overlooks the ferris wheel and lake waters of Seattle. What a view!"
,,,,,"Overall thoughts: food is good, and the ambiance is great as an upscale restaurant for a date or celebration night, or you could just come in regular clothes (felt pretty underdressed though, not going to lie) - great place to dine at!"

,,,,,"Beautiful museum with all glass work from Chihuly. Located in the Seattle Center, right next to the Space Needle. His artwork is simply incredible. I have only pieces in Boston or Las Vegas but I am so glad to see a whole museum dedicated to him. Very stunning form of imagery, well thought out and some pieces are mind blowing. The museum offered a free photo and was delivered via email."
,,,,,Five stars for my favorite of the Seattle attractions we visited. Beautiful glass structures designed very cleverly with elements of nature. Both the indoor and outdoor exhibits were wonderful but the outdoor as well as the terrace were extra spectacular. 
,,,,,"I recommend sitting to watch the short films about other Chihuly displays. Even going slowly in awe and watching the films it took under two hours. Great gift shop, and conveniently located near lots of other hotspots in Seattle Center- the Space"
,,,,," Needle of course, the science center, the children's museum, several theaters, the famous fountain etc. I highly recommend getting the City Pass because if not the price can add up quickly. Overall a nice sized attraction."
,,,,,Came back after a year and I'm even more in love with it than before. Love the artwork and exhibit. One of my favorite places in Seattle. It's just so beautiful. 
,,,,,If you have been here before there are plenty of parking options around. Including a lot next to Museum of Pop which is next door. There's also street parking. I purchased my ticket with the CityPass which I definitely recommend if its your first time in Seattle. Best bang for your buck. It's a bit crowded in here but expected. 
,,,,,They have photographers roaming around if you want free pictures. Definitely recommend if you want a cheap souvenir. Would definitely come back.
,,,,,We got this 3 for 1 deal in regards to attractions and we loved this art display. Gorgeous glass sculptures and art. They also have works take pictures of you for free. It was a beautiful experience to walk through and I would definitely come back here.
,,,,,This place is amazing. We spent hours looking at the glass indoors and out. The way the glass outside blends in with the beautiful flora is so beautiful.
,,,,,TLDR; museum showcasing glass sculptures. We walked through the whole thing in about an hour. Probably wouldn't do it again but it was really amazing to see the exhibits. 
,,,,,"You can buy a combo ticket that includes the Space Needle and Chihuly and that works out perfectly because they're literally right next to each other. Unlike the Space Needle ticket, you don't need to specify a time you'll be arriving. "
,,,,,"I don't want to spoil much but there's an indoor and an outdoor part of the museum. You'll see different landscapes created with glass, you'll see his chandelier collection, and outdoors you'll see how nature and his sculptures come together. There's even a small theatre and an area outside for some demonstrations. "
,,,,,"The artwork is neat but I think, like the Space Needle, it's a ""once in a couple of years"" kind of attraction. I've visited a couple of years before too and noticed that not much changed. But I appreciate how beautiful everything is! It's worth coming if you've never been."
,,,,,"Mesmerizing exhibits and color overload, but in a good way. Good to see once and then it becomes utterly repetitive...blown glass...colorful, repeat."
,,,,,Amazing and beautiful artwork. The pieces in the museum are absolutely stunning. The outside garden is beautiful as well. Worth a visit.
,,,,,WOW! I initially googled places to see in Seattle as I had never been before and this popped up. The ticket prices are moderate. They offer a discounted deal for space needle and glass garden for something like $50. You can purchase tickets online. At the time of purchasing you will have to chose a time slot to check in. All time slots are about 1 hour. Upon arrival you can't have any food or drink inside the museum and they will scan your ticket in order to get in. 
,,,,,The pieces are huge and extremely colorful. It's jaw dropping how detailed every piece is and how every single piece is made of glass. The best in the museum is the multicolored room. The room is filled with numerous colorful pieces that are held up by glass windows. The lights from up above reflect through the windows into the room to create a stained glass effect. It is just stunning! 
,,,,,We spent about an hour here looking at the exhibit both indoors and outdoors. I would recommend to go early morning and preferably on a weekday as crowds are not as large. There's a small cafe and a gift shop available.
,,,,,"I was a bit skeptical on visiting Chihuly Garden and Glass since it's on the top of every tourism list for Seattle, but it was well-worth the visit.  The artwork is beautiful, and I love how they dimmed the lights and lit up the glass so it's so much more reflective.  It also helps with the ambience.  Chihuly Garden and Glass is also right near the Space Needle!"
,,,,,"There is no denying that the artwork is beautiful here.  The glass displays are detailed, vibrant in color, and just magnificent.  Really the biggest downside for me is the price - I'm not sure it's worth the admission ticket, as the museum could easily take less than an hour to roam through.  But if you've got the money to spend and want to see some amazing glass art, this place is for you."

,,,,,"Really great small museum. His glasswork is gorgeous and deservedly famous.  We really enjoyed the 15 minute demo session about how glass objects are made.  I would like more info about the teamwork approach that he uses.  Very fun hour stop, plus it's right next to the Space Needle."
,,,,,This is probably my favorite art exhibit of all time.  Very beautiful glass art everywhere you look. Be sure to watch the short videos to see how some of the art is created.
,,,,,"Just look at the pictures online. We walked through in 5 minutes, not worth the ticket price"
,,,,,"The admission is admittedly steep and I was grateful to be able to see this spot while friends were kindly treating me .  With that said, this was amazing and thoroughly enjoyed my visit.  "
,,,,,I have always been one that loved art museums being able to stand endlessly getting lost in a favorite painting.  I had never expected that it would be that same way with glass whether admiring garden scenes with glass or fanciful underwater sea scenes.  
,,,,,It was an extra special treat to be able to catch glass artists hard at work in their courtyard (using a converted airstream for the furnace) and demonstrating different techniques.  It is great that they offer this experience and save the long drive to Tacoma to see something similar at the Museum of Glass.
,,,,,"Wow! What an awesome exhibit to display Chihuly's craft! My friend and I bought a combo ticket with the Space Needle next door and we were not disappointed. Beautiful exhibits with brilliant colors. And as an amateur photographer, this exhibit has great lighting to capture part of the experience and opportunities to work on your lens angles. The exhibit has both indoor and outdoor spaces. Recommend stopping by the theater to learn more about Chihuly and how he became the artist he is!"
,,,,,"Tip: if you are going to the Space Needle next door, you can purchase a combo ticket that saves you $10!"
,,,,,"I love Chihuly! I've brought several guests here as well and they've always enjoyed it. It seems a bit pricey, but I know that's how those kind of things go..."
,,,,,This is my second time coming here but this time I brought my fiancé with me! It is a beautiful attraction right next to the Seattle Space Needle and Museum of Pop Culture. There's more to just seeing the beautiful created glass pieces but you learn so much! In the future I will definitely want to bring my own kids to see this for themselves!
,,,,,"Love. Love. Love. I don't want to ruin anything, it was amazing. The wife and I explored the glass and learned so much. You should check it out, really not for kids."
,,,,,Beautiful and amazing glass art! Glass is transformed and sculpted in beautiful ways. 100% worth the trip.
,,,,,If you are visiting the space needle you have to stop in this awesome museum! The artwork displayed here is second to none and definitely a Seattle must-see! Maybe find the kids something else to do as this whole place is glass and one bump away from a massive accident haha!

,,,,,"The art of glass blowing has always been a fascination of mine. Artists working with molted glass forming these unbelievable pieces of art. Chihuly takes the art to another level as you see his expressions in 3 Dimensions. From the rich reds to the deep blues, his art will take you from ocean depths to out of this world. "
,,,,,"There is a cool QR code you can download an audio tour of the gallery. Don't just walk by the sculpture, look closely at the level of detail. The small nuances of the arms the birds nest that has made the sculpture its home. The starfish and sea animals. The are is as fun as it is interesting. Thank you Chihuly for sharing your talent and art."
,,,,,"One of a kind and a must-see in Seattle! We got the CityPass and came here twice in the attempt to see the museum. First time it was closed for a private event and there was no announcement on the website, thus I deducted one star. "
,,,,,"The museum itself was simply spectacular. The glass work created a world of fantasy and beauty. I was fully enchanted by the astonishing glass work, and Chihuly's story (there's a video playing about his story). "
,,,,,My personal favorites are in the pictures! It only took us about an hour to finish the tour.
,,,,,Shows cases the artistes work. Honestly beautiful and a fun immersive experience. The gardens are a fun place YO hangout. Definitely a staple for Seattle tourism.
,,,,,"Love this place. So beautiful, enjoy everything about it. A go to place in Seattle, I live here and still live it everytime."
,,,,,Enjoyed the afternoon with the beautiful exhibits.  Timed entry by tickets led be to believe this would be Covid- Safe but the museum was wayyyy too crowded.
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden and Glass was much more than I had hoped for in a glass art museum. We came here straight after visiting the Museum of Pop Culture, which was right around the corner."
,,,,,"I was a little skeptical when I saw the admission prices of this museum. I was worried it would be a tourist trap since it was included in the CityPass. Luckily the lovely young Asian lady working at the front desk let us know that she could apply a student discount to save us some money. If you're reading this, I love you and you deserve a raise for your amazing customer service."
,,,,,"There's photographers at 3 - 4 of the exhibits that will take your photo with Chuhily's masterpieces for free. At the end of the museum visit, I was surprised when I went to view my pictures that they were truly complimentary and didn't even have obnoxious frosted watermarks. How cool is it that this service comes included in your admission price? Had I known sooner, I would've taken more pictures, lol. Take advantage of this!!!!!"
,,,,,"The museum was pretty small, but each exhibit was beautiful and well-preserved. My favorite part of the museum would have to be the actual garden itself. I can't imagine how difficult it was to carefully and gracefully place each glass artwork in the garden without making a mess. God knows my clumsy self would've fell and broken every bone in my body had I been tasked with setting up even a corner of the garden."
,,,,,"Visiting this museum was well-worth the money we spent. Although I would only come here once in my life, I strongly feel that it's an absolute must for anyone visiting the city of Seattle."
,,,,,Such stunning displays of glass art! So vibrantly colorful and spectacular! I've read reviews of people going to Seattle just to see this museum. It is definitely unique and well worth the visit!
,,,,,"Just f-in cool man.  It is visually stunning.  Nice beer garden.  Hard to get good pictures.  A great place to start and then finish with Space needle, etc."
,,,,,"My girlfriends and I came here with a combo ticket for Space Needle and Chihuly museum and it was a great way to spend the afternoon. Thank goodness it was a sunny day! Chihuly is beautiful! The inside museum has a few breathtaking pieces and others were not as impressive. However, the inside museum is dark and lighting is focused on the glass art, so it doesn't make for photos WITH the pieces. "
,,,,,The last sun room though - totally worth the price of the entry ticket. That art piece in the sun room is a show stopper. Plus the natural light makes for great photos of you and the beautiful glass.
,,,,,Don't Break The Glass!!!
,,,,,Chihuly was truly an amazing museum. The craftsmanship of creating the glass art is just crazy. So much detail in each piece.
,,,,,"The glass displays are simply mind blowing. Every room you walk into, you get your socks knocked off. I loved the blackout room with the glowing glass. So awesome. "
,,,,,"And then the final room, with the green house floral feel. You are left speechless. The bright yellow just catches your eyes immediately. "
,,,,,I also really liked the chandeliers in the outside area.
,,,,,$29 for admission. Very small museum. I was in and out in under 30 minutes. Worth the one time visit!

,,,,,5/1/19 Had an opportunity to take an Ikebana Garden Workshop thanks to a wonderful friend it was a Christmas/Birthday gift. There was a yoga class taking place the same morning. I loved that it started at 8am I believe and included entry to view the museum but we didn't have time to take advantage of that which is fine I have been a number of times. What it did provide was a handblown vessel blown at the hot shop for each student to do their arrangement in and bring home to keep. Well worth the cost. The class was taight bu  Megumi Schacher who taught us Sogetsu School of Ikebana. She has been certified at the highest level. The class took place in the Arbor the one area I had never been in on my many previous visits and it could not have been a more perfect space for the class. Would definitely take one of the Garden workshops again. 
,,,,,If I had visitors from out of town I'd take them here. One of my favorite places to take photographs. You can't go wrong in any weather if you want the creative but spring and summer would probably have more blooms in the garden. You absolutely need to go at night sometime the garden is up lit so beautiful!

,,,,,I've absolutely loved coming here over the years but loved more so sharing it with my partner. She's never seen blown glass especially like this she fell in love with the artist. And the exhibit I think she cried a little bit because it was so incredibly beautiful. I got a little teary-eyed because my love for art has grown so much more over the years and I appreciate things differently. Absolutely worth seeing and is also a part of the city pass
,,,,,"A lot of unique glass sculptures/galleries, but I'm not so sure I love this place. If it's your first time visiting Seattle, it's worth a stop, but otherwise you can see Chihuly at the Bellagio."
,,,,,WOW! Chihuly Garden and Glass is absolutely stunning. 
,,,,,It was hard to wrap my mind around the detail and scale of these blown glass art pieces. The entire museum is breathtaking. I'm sure I could return and see details I missed the first time through. I especially enjoyed the glass pieces in the garden. 
,,,,,"There are so many photo opportunities throughout the museum. There are photographers available to take your photo in front of the amazing art, which you can view at the end of the museum and email to yourself for free. "
,,,,,Glass blowing demonstrations are offered throughout the day to get a tiny glimpse as to the work associated with the giant exhibits. 
,,,,,This is a must if visiting Seattle.
,,,,,Awesome glass flowers artwork.  Beautiful in design and color. Indoor pieces more spectacular than outside.
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden is one of the most aesthetically mesmerizing museums that I have ever visited. Definitely worth the price of admission, although I personally skipped out on the combined ticket up the Seattle needle. I don't want to ruin the historical background behind Chihuly and his amazing artwork. Long story short, it is freaking beautiful and quite astounding as the artist managed to surpass every imaginable obstacles to create something so magnanimous, larger than life, and breathtaking. I visited on a random weekday for conference and didn't have to wait in any lines, although based on the electronic admission system that is also time stamped, I presume this place can get busy during tourist seasons. While the hours are 11a-6p, I really would have loved to see a night-light presentation for a more mystical experience."
,,,,,"Take a look of the photos, they represent most of the artwork, however, nothing beats an in-person visit. While the museum may not be large, the experience will be priceless."
,,,,,"I knew this place was the place to visit when in Seattle, but I underestimated the craftsmanship it takes to build these incredible pieces. The glass blowing demonstration was really interesting, and it made me appreciate the art we were seeing even more. Each room had a theme of what inspired Dale chihuly: marine life, flowers, chandeliers, Japanese culture..."
,,,,,"The giftshop offers some chihuly pieces you can buy, but it's gonna cost you $1000+. Tickets for the museum are $30ish, but citypass has a deal where you can buy the space Needle + chihuly museum pass bundle for less."
,,,,,What a beautiful exhibit!! Creative and stunning. Fluid glass! Well laid out both the indoor pieces and the garden. Worth a visit.
,,,,,"Visited Seattle over this past weekend and boy let me tell you this was by far probably one of my favorite things we saw over the weekend. Would totally recommend coming here, it's so pretty and the history behind it is pretty interesting. They even have a tutorial on how the glass is made. Highly recommend if you are thinking about coming to Seattle go here for sure and make sure to bring your camera!"
,,,,,"As an Indigenous person, I was SUPER happy to see the exhibits nod to Indigenous folks through the Edward Curtis photos and the Pendleton wall. The glass sculptures were beautiful. My only complaint is that I wish the workers would regulate the crowd better. So many people just make the experience hot and uncomfortable.  "
,,,,,Cool part is that pictures can be taken! I walked away with lots of people photographs! I'd recommend this place.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"I was familiar with Chihuly's work from the Garfield Observatory in Chicago, IL and this displace did not disappoint."
,,,,,I found the informational movie especially helpful and contained tidbits about Chihuly that I did not know.
,,,,,"This display is set up so any ""idiot"" photographer, like me, can take great photos. "
,,,,,Definitely work the cost of admission!
,,,,,"Chihuly Glass Garden is so beautiful! I made reservations for both the Glass Garden and Space Needle. The time of arrival was 5pm-7pm and I was under the impression that getting there around 6 would be ok, after going to the Space Needle -I was wrong! We ended up getting there too late and they were just about to close! The host was really sweet and let us walk through QUICKLY! "
,,,,,"Let me tell you, it was still worth it! The pieces were gorgeous! Everything was so bright, colorful, and vivid. This is basically a museum of blown glass art. From different shapes and sizes to tall pieces, it was stunning to see the artistry! I definitely recommend this place, you really get to appreciate the different type of art that is out there and the amount of work that went into this museum! Definitely will come here again whenever I come to Seattle!"
,,,,,Located in the Seattle Center right next to the Space Needle so it's a good thing to visit if you want to kill two birds with one stone. I bought my tickets online and they had a package deal where you can visit the Space Needle and the Chihuly Garden Museum the same day in one payment. 
,,,,,I visited the Space Needle around 5pm and after I came here. But the day I went they told everyone that it was closed due to a private event. I was a little shocked because I thought they would at least email you or leave some kind of notice on the website that it would be closed that day. The guy told me I can get my refund if I go back to the Space Needle where you buy the tickets or I can come back tomorrow. So I went and I told the lady what happened. She gave me a partial refund for all three tickets. I asked her if I can come back tomorrow. She explained that I can but it was like I had to pay the difference but the way she said it was super confusing. 
,,,,,The next day I come back and I showed the admissions the ticket with the refund recipient and I told him that I was their yesterday but they were closed. The guy just said okay and scanned my ticket and I was let in. I didn't have to pay anything! So kinda confusing!
,,,,,The museum itself was super pretty and nice! Had beautiful glass art. They offer free photographers that take your photo and give you a scan card so after the museum you can go to a kiosk and email that photo to you! The museum has glass inside and outside and you can see the Space Needle as well. Overall nice museum and definitely should check out. I think for the museum itself it's ($34) but if you want the package deal with the Space Needle visit it's ($61)
,,,,,"This is indeed a must-visit of Seattle. I don't like tourist traps, but Chihuly is a wonderful art experience that just happens to be in the touristy part of the city. I highly recommend this museum to anyone!"
,,,,,"The museum has a thoughtful collection of Chihuly's inspiration for glass artwork and his unique style. You will be enamored by the colors, light, and texture of the art pieces. my favorite part of the museum was the botanical garden - there are photographers there as well who can take complementary photos of you. It's not a big museum, so it'll take no more than 2 hours for you to go around the place."
,,,,,"Side tip: if you're interested in how glass art is made, you should check out the glass museum in Tacoma. That one has an actual glass studio with live demonstrations!"
,,,,,"Wow! What an amazing art exhibit! Everything about this place was the most creative and beautiful thing that I could've imagined and seeing today. We witnessed the most beautiful glass art, and then we came across a beer/food garden. While enjoying our amazing cocktails and woodfired pizza, we experienced a glass blowing event in the garden that was spectacular! We witnessed pure talent making beautiful pieces that are sold at the space needle gift shop, that benefit the Seattle community financially in a major"
,,,,,"way! Of course we purchased a piece! But in the meantime, we had a run-in with a crazy employee! As we were trying to walk out to the gardens with our drinks sitting, we were told that was not allowed. Completely understandable. But at the same time, there was no signage, and we were scolded in a way that was absolutely unacceptable. We were demeaned and told to sit at the rectangle tables like we were elementary school children who were in trouble. (very Truchbull ) Then when the two people who actually had drinks sat down the third person was scolded once again and told to sit down and did not have a drink! Because of this I don't know that I will bring any other family or friends, especially children back to this venue. This person actually had the nerve to call security on us, and as security interviewed us and we discussed the issue, they let us know that they would watch the cameras, because we were not being unreasonable and this person absolutely was. I hope she has her clipboard removed, and I hope no one else has to experience how uncomfortable she made us. We definitely would've stayed, and experienced the rest of the Chihuly gardens in  it's entirety had it not been for the unfortunate encounter with this rude employee."
,,,,,Chihuly Garden & Glass in Seattle is open from 10 am till 7 pm. Adult admission is $21 (13+) while a youth ticket is $14. Some people prefer the combo ticket (Space Needle & Chihuly) $42 adult and $26 youth. The City Pass offers another options. While you are considering those options be aware that admission after 4 pm to Chihuly is discounted.
,,,,,"Rooms are curated in terms of themes. Mini talks about each room are given by the staff. There is the marine life, flowers, chandeliers, Japanese culture, etc. which are all spectacular. The staging of the is a work of art in itself. The atrium of glass holds demonstrations on the hour and there is an exquisite cascading lei of flowers morphing into butterflies from the ceiling. The theater plays 5 Chihuly behind the scenes videos explaining Dale Chihuly's design process. Be sure to ask about there free photo which will be emailed to you."
,,,,,"You are allowed hand held photos or videos. Most rooms are staged in dim light so a low light camera is necessary. That became a problem for me. I should have done more research before I visited and brought my low light camera. There is a book store which sells authentic Chihuly pieces. Bring a check-book and be ready to spend a $1,000+."
,,,,,This museum is incredible. I have never seen art quite like it. Our group loved checking it all out. 
,,,,,I'd recommend grouping your tickets for space needle and this if you're doing both as it is cheaper. There are also options to bunch the zoo with this as well or you can buy a city pass which gets you into several attractions at a cheaper price. 
,,,,,We were the last few people to get in for the day so be sure to check the schedule for any early closures (we weren't aware it was an early close day but there was a wedding there that night). Due to the early close we weren't able to go inside the glasshouse but we could still see in from the outside which was still cool. 
,,,,,"The entire museum takes around an hour to get through, though you could easily spend less or more time than that depending on how much you want to see, if you do the audio tour (bring your own headphones if you want that free add on for more info!!), watch videos, sit in the garden etc. "
,,,,,"They let you take pictures but just be sure to not touch anything, they are sticklers (rightfully so since everything is glass...) definitely recommend adding this to your must see list in Seattle."
,,,,,"Really a lovely museum if you are into sculpture (especially glass work), and so close to everything it's easy to make a day of it. Whenever I have friends that visit who have never been to Seattle, I always make sure we hit up the CG&G."
,,,,,"This is probably a must-visit of Seattle. There are so many beautiful pieces in here, plus a small theatre showing Chihuly's story/background. The garden area with the iconic Chihuly flowers is a great IG location, plus you can get the Space Needle in the shot if you're looking upwards. All in all, beautiful artwork and well worth the admission cost. (It's included as an option if you purchase CityPass)."
,,,,,"Overall visit took just over an hour, but most of that was just trying to take as many pictures as possible. Most of the inside exhibits are too dark for you to get good pictures with the artwork, but the outside ones are made for those beautiful IG shots. There are a few photographers stationed inside that will take pictures for you (not sure if they are free or not). This was probably my favorite attraction when visiting Seattle, highly recommend! I'd also want to come back at night too - I imagine it would be a very different experience."
,,,,,"My friend had to use the restroom which is located outside the museum. They didn't tell us we wouldn't be able to go back in waste of money. Staff doesn't do a good job helping or informing people. Will never return again, also went here 3 years ago nothing has changed about it."
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"Highly recommend if you're coming to Seattle. I was planning on visiting with my City Pass (also highly recommend if you're doing any tourist things in Seattle), but found a yin yoga class under the glasshouse. It was the perfect way to end a rainy night , with some restorative yoga in a gorgeous setting. "
,,,,,"The glass museum itself isn't that big but there are a handful of intricate, beautiful displays and a theater that shows videos/history of Chihuly."
,,,,,NOTE: if you plan on doing the space needle also purchase the combo ticket to save some cash. we bought individually and spent alot. 
,,,,,the photos are instagram worthy. beautiful pieces for sure. and expensive so make sure not to stand so close or touch. 
,,,,,tickets were little steep though about $40 pp and we finish under an hour.
,,,,,It was nice but especially overpriced. I have seen traveling works of his that were much greater volume and half the price. There were outdated videos to watch that took up about 30 minutes of our time there. 
,,,,,"The employees tell you up-front that it takes about an hour or a bit more to go through, however, after we had seen all of the works, the videos, and viewed the glass blowing demonstration, I kept looking around the corner thinking ""there must be more"". There wasn't."
,,,,,"The glass museum in Corning, NY is phenomenal compared to this."
,,,,,"The Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum features some of the most colorful and intricate blown glass art pieces that I have ever laid my eyes upon. The art is creative and stunningly beautiful, and the gardens are so pristine."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"When you first enter into the exhibit, you'll be surrounded by a wall full of beautiful handmade quilts, baskets, and glass vases. The next few rooms to follow all feature very unique and colorful blown glass pieces. Some of the glass pieces are incredibly large and are coiled up into all different shapes. The dark rooms really allow the most colorful pieces to literally glow right before your eyes. I couldn't even believe that some of the art was actually made of just glass! There's a stunning stained glass ceiling that you can't help but to look up and admire as you make your way from one exhibit to the next."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"The glasshouse is immaculate! The ceiling is 40 feet high and features and incredible orange, red, and yellow, glass ceiling that's 100 feet long. It's a beautiful conservatory with great views of the nearby Space Needle and Seattle Center. The gardens are also something to rave about. The gardens are filled with several different types of flowers, and there are a few glass pieces that are placed throughout the gardens. They also have live glass blowing demonstrations which is a real treat if you can get up close enough to see them."
,,,,, 
,,,,,"This should go without saying, but you are not to touch any of the artwork (although it'll make you wish that you could). A photographer will come around to take your picture in front of one of the giant glass pieces. You'll get one picture for free! They have many souvenirs and glass pieces for sale in their gift shop. Some of the pieces were going for as much as $7,000! Wow! I guess this glass is no joke. If you have a CityPass, this is one of the attractions that is featured on the pass. I absolutely loved visiting this art museum and it was one of my favorite museums to visit. If you're visiting Seattle, a visit to the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum is a must"
,,,,,"If there is one thing to do in Seattle, this would be it! We got there relatively early and stayed for a little over two hours. The museum isn't huge however each installation offers spaciousness to experience it at the fullest. I felt so inspired after being in the space and could have honestly spent all day in there. The Chihuly art is like sparkling jewels come to life in the dark seaworld. A fun treat is a glass blowing demo by the staff offered as a part of the admission. Don't miss!"
,,,,,"When I went to Seattle, the Chihuly Garden and Glass was for sure one of the biggest destinations that I wanted to explore as a tourist there. Everything that you see when you walk around is so intricate and unique. And I honestly can just stare at these pieces and be mesmerized for the entire day. "
,,,,,"Dale Chihuly has created some of the most impressive masterpieces that are essentially created by melted glass mixed together. When you walk inside the store, you will go to the front desk to buy your pass in order to go inside the museum. Once inside, you'll be walking through a dark path only to encounter that his artwork are brightly lit. Make sure you capture all these moments because they're all so interestingly beautiful! I'm honestly a sucker with museums in general and I truly thought that this whole tour left me captivated for more! I was so sad when I finished going through all of his pieces, and it felt so quick as well. "
,,,,,"By the end of the walk through, when you walk outside, there was a little performance of two people showing an audience of how glass art was made. It looked so cool and I was so glad I got to experience seeing that live. It made me appreciate how much time and effort people put into perfecting their workmanship. And also, like any other museum you also have a gift shop by the time your finish your tour as well. I would love to come back here again if I ever make a trip back to Seattle!"
,,,,,"I saw a Chihuly exhibit 10 years ago in Phoenix, and it was amazing. So, coming here was a no brainer. Admission is steep, so we waited until 6 pm, when the price drops from $32 to $22. Smart move!"
,,,,,The glass is spectacular. Extremely creative. A lot of variety. Colorful. Dynamic.
,,,,,The only drawback in my mind is the value. We were in and out in about an hour. I suppose you could stay here longer if you took pictures of everything -- which some people do -- but there's not a ton to see for the price you pay ... even with the discount.
,,,,,"I love it here. For the record, I think it'd be a sweet place to go while stoned. I imagine many people have. My girlfriend and I came on a rainy Saturday (shocking, I know), and paid $34 a ticket. "
,,,,,Each room is as stunning as the next. The vibrance. The colors. The shapes. It's all delightful. It's awesome to walk through the garden and see the blending of the glass with the surrounding flora. 
,,,,,"We probably spent a little over an hour there, which felt like enough time. We caught a little bit of a glass blowing demo, and there were some hecklers, which actually made the show even more engaging. "
,,,,,Wish we had this much Chihuly in Chicago.
,,,,,Wow. What did I just see.....
,,,,,Great place for discovering and learning. 
,,,,,We came with a toddler so it was a bit tricky to keep her away from all the fragile beauty :) Watch out! 
,,,,,Other than that make sure to get a combo ticket along with space needle so save a few bucks
,,,,,Must see if you love blown glass! We came in here after we visited the space needle. It was a very nice museum like feel. There is someone standing in each room to make sure that no one is touching any of the pieces. They also offer free photos that you can download or send to yourself. The glass was absolutely amazing and each room has a story on what each piece represents. 
,,,,,"There is a glass house that you can walk into and take photos with the beautiful blown glass that are hanging like chandeliers. I actually think that it would be a beautiful space for a very small party or reception. I don't even know if they rent that place out, So don't quote me on it! Very cute, a good tip is to get this when you get your ticket for the space needle. We were done in about one hour.  Make sure to visit this beautiful place if you want to see amazing class!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,I'm sure everything I want to say already has been said.
,,,,,"This place is amazing, beautiful, gorgeous, educational, and mindblowing. I've been here twice now (and will come back even more times because I decided to get the Annual Pass) and it never ceases to amaze me looking at Chihuly's pieces. He is a Master when it comes to glass and creativity. I cannot tell you how much I love his pieces. "
,,,,,"Short talks: Not only is this museum about looking at his pieces, but they do mini talks about each other at various times so you get to dive deeper and learn more about each room. "
,,,,,Glass Demos: I love love watching the glass demos that take place in the garden every hour. I can't get enough of watching them make globs of hot glass into beautiful works of art. I love it!!
,,,,,"Videos: After you're tired of walking, you can go to the theatre room and watch 4 (or 5) of Chihuly's behind the scenes videos. I got to learn how he makes the beautiful chandeliers and the giant glass bowls. It's so interesting hearing from him and watch his creative process!"
,,,,,"Overall, I can spend a good 4 hours here easily. It is cheaper to come here after dusk and I will recommend you do once at dusk and once during the day because the rooms with outdoor views look completely different with different lighting. I love love love this place!!!"
,,,,,Wow wow wow. You'll be open mouthed the entire time just looking at all the amazing pieces that Chihuly has put on display. I am so in awe of his work. 
,,,,,What makes this place great:
,,,,,"+ Each room features different themes and beautiful pieces in a variety of ways. Pieces inspired by colors, water, sea, shapes, and the list goes on. You will be WOWed with every room you enter."
,,,,,+ Excellent place to bring your visitors. Chihuly is from the area so this is a special museum. 
,,,,,"+ Discount for residents. Annual membership, I think, is totally worth it!! You get 5 additional tickets (4 are quarterly and 1 is anytime), plus you get into all their events for free such as Yoga, plus a free guest at dusk hours, and so much more. You should definitely check it out if you love your visit (you don't have to decide until at the end of your first visit). It was $160."
,,,,,+ They have great planned talks. The schedule is posted throughout the gallery. They use a microphone so everyone in the room can hear the talk. I found them very informative.
,,,,,+ One of my favorite parts was the live glass blown demonstrations. They happen on the half hour (I think) and it's in the garden. Get there early to get a seat up front. You get a small glimpse into glass making - I saw them make a beautiful bowl. They sell the products in the Space Needle gift shop. (definitely pricey though!)
,,,,,I can't wait to come back after dark. I hear it's so different after the lights turn on!!
,,,,,"This is review based off a rude employee(s) not so much the center, I was just taking off my jacket and this chick with short brown hair scolded me for it and wanted me to RIGHT AWAY take off my crap off of a bench I wasn't breaking any rules or anything she just took her job way too fucking seriously I told her to wait like 2 fucking seconds. It's not like I can grow an extra pair of fucking arms. Honestly most the employees have sticks up thier asses here. My mother in Law was also just taking pictures and they scolded her to not touch anything. She DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH ANYTHING! Just save your money. Bunch of assholes there"
,,,,,Bought my combo ticket for Chihuly Garden and Glass museum + Space Needle. 
,,,,,"Loved everything, such a great place to visit. "
,,,,,Glad I was able to see a live demo of how they make glass bowls.
,,,,,"Chihuly is absolutely beautiful.... very expensive, but BEAUTIFUL. The whole exhibit takes about 1-1.5 hours to cruise through, which seems short, but it felt like every new room was even more breathtaking than the last. "
,,,,,"The rooms each have themes, they encourage picture taking, and they end with the garden exhibit. There is no rush to move through quickly, and I wouldn't say any one room was too crowded. "
,,,,,"I definitely don't regret paying for it, especially since this is the type of thing you do once and skip on your return visit. "
,,,,,Pro-Tip: you can bundle tickets to the space needle and save some money!
,,,,,"I never planned to visit the Chihuhly garden.  I always said, why visit? We live in Seattle, the whole city is a museum of Chihuhly glass. Indeed, you can find installations throughout our fair city, in restaurants and malls, doctor's offices and plazas. I doubted I'd be impressed."
,,,,,"I was WRONG. The collection here is breath taking. Every corner held something new and exciting. The colors and composition were so beautiful. I was angry at myself for not coming sooner, and sure that I would return for a visit in the near future."
,,,,,"If you don't give this place 10 out of 5 stars I have to wonder if you're human. Seriously, it is truly breathtaking from the moment you walk through the doors to the very end. Our group of 6 did the 9AM tour right when they opened, which was brilliant because you avoided the crowds and didn't have to wait for people to move so you could take tons of photos and videos. It is indoor and outdoor, so you can take your time over 2-3 hours or you can get in and out quickly. Our group was efficient and didn't have to wait for anyone in front of us, so we finished it at a relaxing pace within 30-40 minutes. Be sure to go through the theatre, so you can watch the videos of Dale Chihuly talking about his work. I actually wished there had been more videos playing in the installations. It would have been interesting to hear his thoughts about each installation. You get that at the end in the theatre, but incorporating it would have been ideal."
,,,,,Loved the beautiful glass sculptures. The colors and shapes show so much movement. How wonderfully put together. The light often set some prices into a glow. It was other worldly.
,,,,,This was the number one attraction during our family trip to Seattle. I love Chihuly and couldn't wait to show my teenagers his amazing work.
,,,,,We actually walked around the inside and outside twice! 
,,,,,"It was busy, but it was easy to get entrance tickets and walk around. Exhibits were lighted and staged beautifully."
,,,,,"Was pretty hesitant to go here at first, but wow! "
,,,,,"The glass art pieces are absolutely gorgeous up close and in person. You can definitely see the attention to detail that is put into every single piece. The exhibit will probably take you 30mins to an hour depending on how fast you choose to go. Or you can stay longer if you want to sit down and see all the short films of the artist creating his pieces, which I definitely recommend!"
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle Center visiting some attractions this a must visit among the area. I thought I wouldn't be that into it, but I was wrong. Stunning work!"
,,,,,"I don't think Yelp would let me just say ""Just go"" and leave it at that."
,,,,,Would they?
,,,,,Just go.
,,,,,---------------------------
,,,,,If you want more tho:
,,,,,"Chihuly is located at the Seattle Center and right next to the Space Needle. There are some Republic Parking lots nearby that you can park at, and then it is just a quick walk over. There is a Seattle CityPass that Chihuly is a part of (which saves you a considerable amount of money on admission) but I was not going to have time for multiple attractions- I think it was $32+tax which is kinda crazy (it's $22 in the evenings, I forget what time after tho). You can also save and get a Chihuly/Space Needle combo for about $60."
,,,,,"The kiosk to purchase the ticket is in the front and you get it scanned before the first exhibit. Yeah, the showcase is incredible. You get to look at a lot of glass exhibits inside which show how brilliant the contrast of colors and how to make everything just come out. Unique experience, yes. They have glass flowers on top too for an exhibit! Walk through, continuing on you do end up being in a glasshouse with an incredible exhibit. Take the time to enjoy THAT. There's also an outside garden to look through as well and it's kinda cool to see the amount of work and detail put into each piece. "
,,,,,"Takes about 45-90 mins, depending on how much you pace. Is it worth? Now I wanna go during sunset and night actually...."
,,,,,Gift shop as well once you finish haha.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"Wow, loved it. The workers were welcoming. They checked for vaccination, so bring your proof. We got there an hour before close, and I wish I had more time. There is so much to look at and it is all so interesting. We loved it."
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden and Glass museum is amazing. The glass is bright and creatively stimulating, large variety of pieces, worth a visit. Pricey daily pass if you're bringing a family, but a great date night idea if you're into art!"
,,,,,Thought this place would be overrated but is actually great even with kids. Took my 2 year old who loved the vibrant colors. They also had a glass blowing show that was really cool to watch! Will definitely be back. Reservations and tickets were easy to buy online.
,,,,,"Probably one of my favorite places in Seattle. Truly magical in person. If you're an artist or just appreciate beautiful artwork, then I'd recommend checking out. Truly a gem for locals or tourists."
,,,,,"Gorgeous!! Don't miss sightseeing here. There glass artworks are beautiful!! Imagine ocean , universe something like that. Beautiful!!"
,,,,,Small but amazing gallery. Beautiful glass pieces and a glass/flower garden beneath the space needle. 
,,,,,They also have glass blowing demonstrations that was worth sitting in on. Inspired me to want to try it myself. 
,,,,,Pro tip- discount after 4pm.
,,,,,You must see this to appreciate. Photos and videos will not do justice. Also had a nice meal and drink at their cafe. Every piece of the glass displays was incredible.  The garden alone was worth a trip.
,,,,,"WELL worth the admission cost! I went alone when visiting my friend in Seattle as she had to work. Such a beautiful exhibit; all very different artwork, incredibly vibrant colorful creations. "
,,,,,Be sure to check out the garden part near the end. They have a day and night ticket combo or day ticket or night ticket pricing. 
,,,,,Not sure if the photographer is always there but a professional photographer took my photo near one of the glass structures and I was able to email it to myself to keep for free (kiosk near the front entrance/exit by the gift shop).

,,,,,"It's hard to pick a favorite museum in Seattle, but this one is definitely the most insta-worthy. I strongly recommend coming at their late-in-the-day price in the summer, where you pay much less but still get to see everything. You get through the whole gallery and gardens in about two hours and it's light outside til after closing hours anyways. This is a great place to bring someone visiting Seattle, because where they're from doesn't have anything like this. "
,,,,,"Chihuly really is one of a kind, and this isn't like any art museum you've been to. The indoor garden exhibit is incredible, the outdoor garden and glass is beautiful, and the greenhouse ceiling installation is rightfully Instagram famous. However, I think my favorite part is at the end, where they have a theater constantly playing mini documentaries about the artist and his process. Don't skip it over! Watching the glass being worked is mesmerizing and gives me a greater appreciation for the pieces."
,,,,,It is quite an experience walking into this Glass Garden. The whole walk will take about 1-1.5 hours and it is truly worth it. You can get a combo ticket (with Space Needle) online that is really worth its cost!
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"This is hands down the best museum I've ever seen. Compared to classical art museums, I really understand the vision and why Chihuly created these glass masterpieces. You can't help but to smile and marvel over his creations. Outside, the glass garden is whimsical and breathtaking. There is a beautiful view of the space needle. To top it off, you must take moment to watch a live demo on glasswork in the outdoor hot shop. You can buy the art created from the demos in the space needle souvenir shop. We had a wonderful conversation with Sophie (a glass artist) following the live demo."
,,,,,"Chihuly is one of my favorite cultural spots in Seattle to bring out of town guests -- they are always ""blown"" away! (See what I did there? Blown glass? Lol)"
,,,,,"Adult tickets are approximately $32 but you could also do a combo ticket to visit Chihuly + the Space Needle for $49. You could spend all day staring at the glass exhibits, but my visitors and I spent approximately 3 hours touring the museum and garden and we felt that it was sufficient to get the full experience. "
,,,,,"Depending on the time and day, they have live glass blowing demonstrations in the garden area and we LOVED it. I highly recommend timing your visit so that you can see how the glass is really made!"
,,,,,"Absolutely stunning! We got the ticket that included the space needle, so we got to do both - great price for the two combine. About $50 per ticket, you do have to wear a mask while anywhere inside but whatever I'm used to it by now so I can't complain. It was just breathtaking I was nervous I was going to break something. Definitely something you need to do as a tourist in Seattle. Oh they also had someone walking around taking pictures if you wanted for free!!! Can't ask for anything else really, other places would charge you $20+ for a photo"
,,,,,"Pretty iconic place, but quite expensive for how small the museum is. A lot of pictures of sculptures are all over social media, but still a fun experience to come. Would say that you can finish the museum in under 30 minutes even at a pretty leisurely place, so don't expect this to take up a ton of time if you are planning a trip."
,,,,,The garden was amazing. After watching the netflix series blown away I had a huge appreciation of the glass blowing art. Watched one of glass blowing in action which was fun! One downside is the giftshop os very expensive. We did the package with the space needed.
,,,,,"I've been twice, and both were equally stunning, but very different in terms of crowds and photo ops due to the them.  "
,,,,,"The first visit was on a weekday evening about an hour before closing time.  It was awesome!  We were able to take our time enjoying the unobstructed views of the exhibits and also get a lot of pictures without anyone else photobombing them.  The only bummer was the glass house was closed for a private event, so we weren't able to go inside."
,,,,,"The second visit was midday on a weekend and the place was a zoo!  This time, we also purchased the space needle package, so we had to watch our time carefully here since you have a designated timeslot for the space needle.  (I would have loved in and out privileges here.)  They also have a few photographers around that will take a digital photo of you for free!"
,,,,,"So, if you are like me and want absolutely no else in your photo (and also to really enjoy all the beauty and bling Chihuly has to offer), I suggest a weeknight visit.  I would also call ahead to make sure all the exhibits are open!"
,,,,,Honestly I wasn't expecting much. Once inside the art glass pieces where even more beautiful than the pictures online! If you are going to do some or most of the attractions get the city pass. A little on the small side but very nice with lots of glass/art pieces.
,,,,,"Such a great museum! Very unique and colorful! I recommend getting the space needle and Chihuly tickets together because it's cheaper and right next to each other. It's a museum like no other and probably my favorite museum in Seattle. A definite ""must see"" if visiting Seattle!"
,,,,,I'm not sure I'm saying much new but this is a really beautiful place to spend time. It's really beautiful and something to behold - you are allowed to take pictures but they never do it justice. Great experience reasonable price.
,,,,,A must see when in Seattle. You'll see the best blown glass arts to mankind. Dale Chihuly is gifted beyond belief. Colors of the arts are vibrant and astonishing.

,,,,,"We had space needle and Chihuly museum ticket combo. You are required to wear your masks even you are vaccinated. It's a pretty quick tour. There was a glass workshop in the outdoor area where you can also get wine,spirits and quick bites. Be aware Pizza is super greasy!"
,,,,,"A feast for the eyes, I love Chihuly! Bright, vibrant colors- glass stretched, twisted & curved into intricate & huge designs. This was not my first time experiencing Chihuly & I'd bet, not my last. Some of the exhibits were similar to ones I've seen in other cities. The boats of huge orbs set on a mirror like surface so you get the reflection. The chandeliers, pieces that go from floor to ceiling in an hourglass shape. The ceiling of glass- scattering colors in every direction. The highlight for me was the gardens. Fantasy meets real world in an enchanting display of glass & flowers. Beautiful globes set in flowerbeds & curved glass spikes. Huge towering glass sculptures jutting up amongst the tall bushes. A playground for your imagination for sure. I hope to take a full glass blowing course one day & be able to create my own artistic playground, inspired by ask the remarkable works I've seen by Chihuly."
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden and Glass is located right past the space needle and is $57 plus tax for access to both here and the space needle. There is no timed entry here so you can either go before or after you visit the space needle. The lack of timed entry does make the exhibit a bit crowded at times, depending on what time and day you choose to go. The glass pieces inside are very beautiful and vibrantly colored. There are different rooms indoors, each with a theme, as well as an outdoor garden section. The Community Hot Shop located at the end of the garden has glass blowing demonstrations every hour. It was pretty cool to watch them live and to be able to see the whole process. When you enter the building again after the garden, there is a theater to the right and the exit to the left. The exit leads to a large gift shop, where you can purchase pieces that may have been created at the Community Hot Shop."
,,,,,This place is absolutely beautiful. We were in Seattle visiting for the weekend I noticed when I was booking my ticket for the space needle that had this option available also. I'm glad I bought the tickets for this so I could go check it out. The line wasn't too long we waited just for a few minutes to get in. But the garden it is just breathtaking. Totally recommend visiting if you are in Seattle. The whole exhibit Took maybe 45 minutes to check out or not even that but it's really amazing.
,,,,,Very Nice exhibit. Tons of people and tourists taking photos and looking at the glass. They even had a demonstration outside which was neat. Parking was a pain but it's Seattle..
,,,,,I would HIGHLY recommend this when visiting Seattle!! We bought the bundle with the space needle and enjoyed both.
,,,,,We were especially excited for this after watching the Netflix special on glass blowing. There are both indoor and outdoor exhibits so visit when the sun's out and not about to go down! There are employees almost around each piece offering free photos so take advantage of it! We loved that we were able to email these photos to ourselves as a memory.
,,,,,I prefer the indoor exhibits than the outdoor ones. It's a pretty short tour of everything but it's really beautiful!
,,,,,"If you've ever been to the Bellagio in Las Vegas and saw the Fiori di Como, the 2,000 piece, colorful, glass blossom sculpture that hangs from the ceiling of the resort's lobby, you've seen a Dale Chihuly piece.  That was my first introduction to his work years ago. Fast forward 10+ years later, I found myself in Seattle where this museum is located."
,,,,,"This museum is dedicated to all of Chihuly's beautiful glass works of art.  Each exhibit has a different look and feel as you move through the museum.  There are indoor and outdoor pieces throughout the grounds, including a spacious glass atrium.  "
,,,,,My favorite piece was the glass sculpture in the atrium that is suspended from the ceiling above.  It is absolutely stunning with a mix of some of my favorite colors.  You can even see the Space Needle towering above from this room.
,,,,,They also have glass blowing demonstrations and the staff goes through each step of the process in detail.  Arrive there early if you want to snag a seat.  They go fast once the demo begins.  
,,,,,"I probably stayed about 1 1/2 to 2 hours and ended my tour at the gift shop.  There are tons of souvenirs to choose from and some of Chihuly's glass pieces are also available for sale.  Warning, they are quite pricey!"
,,,,,"Overall, a great stop on your Seattle trip. I thought the entrance fee was a little pricey to see just one artist's work and the museum is not that big, but I am glad I was able to make it happen on my last trip here.  I probably wouldn't go again for a long time unless there more additions to the collection."
,,,,,Really cool experience and amazing artwork. Went pretty quick and I was bored pretty fast. But I can appreciate good work and talent.
,,,,,Beautiful glass and art museum. It doesn't matter if you're an avid glass collector of sorts or if you just like looking at beautiful things. Family friendly and a super friendly staff.
,,,,,Well worth the time and money to visit this beautiful installation. We loved the gallery and the garden where pieces are displayed in nature. We purchased our tickets ahead of time which definitely helped cut down on wait time when we got there. I loved that the different rooms focused on unique themes and phases of the artist's life.
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"Really pretty and worth the price if you get the space needle/Chihuly garden deal. Otherwise, way too expensive. "
,,,,,But so cool. So fun to see once. But we definitely wouldn't go back again. 
,,,,,"However, so many amazing pieces to see and I'm glad we went."
,,,,,"Don't get me wrong..This is a beautiful exhibit of glass artwork however the experience was over in 15 minutes. Upon entry I ohhed and awed with the rest of the guests as our senses were immersed with a kaleidoscope and prisms of art in the shape of glass.  Then it was over before it even started.  In terms of value for money, it's hard to pay $30+ for admission for a few rooms displaying various works of colored glass and sculptures. The garden was more of a small winding path and not impressive with more cement and greenery than glasswork art.  Honestly, one of the most memorable parts of the museum was the $15 wood fire pizza at the end. There was also a glassblowing performance that had viewers attempting to crowd around a small space to watch two people create a work of glass art from scratch. I think I expected more out of this museum as coming from DC I am used to the large, multi level free museums. Paying so much for a few short moments of viewing colored glass just seemed overpriced and left me underwhelmed especially as I thought about the additional $15 that I paid for parking."
,,,,,Literally the most beautiful place I've ever been. See attached photos.  It makes me want to take up glass blowing LOL. food is  great too
,,,,,"Drinks not allowed in :) remember that folks. I wasted money and decided to not go in and (well first, I was not having a great day so my attitude was up the roof). I decided that watching dogs play behind the chihuly garden was better lol."
,,,,,"Came here, because wth?! We bought it along with tickets to the space needle. Gorgeous glass pieces. The garden part was okay, thought it would a little more wow popping. There where not a lot of people in certain parts of the meuseum or so it seemed. The guy taking the tickets/scanning tickets was a little rude. I feel this exhibit is only a one time thing, though most of the pieces are amazing, once was enough."
,,,,,The best of Seattle!  Not to be missed!
,,,,,Truly remarkable artistry indoors and out.  
,,,,,So many great experiences here including New Years Eve in the atrium looking at the fireworks through the glass.  Magic!
,,,,,"Must see! Such a beautiful display of glass art, this museum will leave you in awe and with full appreciation for Dale Chihuly's talent. BRAVO!"
,,,,,Wow wow wow! It's not like any other Seattle  tourist attractions on the list. We went in with a blank slate with no idea as to what to expect in there. But I was mindblown. The glass art is AMAZING! Every piece is unique and beautiful. I could practically spend hours looking at the art work. I was lucky enough to have caught their little workshop where they demo how glass is heated and given shape. It was something!! Love the place. I have taken all my out-of-town-guests here..I mean how do you miss a place like this?!??
,,,,,"I could say anything bad about a Chihuly. It was a very ethereal experience, the garden was beautiful with the glass sculptures intermingled with real plants."
,,,,,The Chihuly Garden is worth a stop!  The artwork is all made of glass and is held in various rooms indoors as well as in the gardens outside.   Each room holds different pieces with different themes.  Oddly enough the pieces look even more spectacular in photos than they do in person!  
,,,,,The museum sits in the shadow of the Space Needle (you can get a combo ticket for the museum and the Space Needle!) and was such a soothing and calming place to spend some time.  While the museum is not huge there is much to see.  The interior courtyard has frequent glassblowing demonstrations with the pieces created there sold in the Space Needle gift shop.
,,,,,With social distancing measures tickets are sold for timed entry.  They ask all entrants to twirl 2x so that a UV light can be used for sanitizing visitors.
,,,,,"Their site has some recommended parking garages nearby but on a weekday around noon, I saw plenty of metered street parking nearby.  For this Chihuly Garden I would say that 1 hour is more than adequate for a visit, but plan for 2 if you want to see the Space Needle and walk around the area."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"We've been putting off going to this place, but we finally visited. We regret not going sooner. This place is incredible. I have never seen such art like this before and is probably my favorite museum in Seattle. It's a little bit short/small museum, but we took our time there. It is definitely worth going and checking it out."
,,,,,I love this museum. So iconic and very Seattle. Have brought many out of town guests here! Seems like a great venue for event but expensive to book unfortunately (makes sense for its popularity).
,,,,,"A classic Seattle Center destination. I'm generally not big on art museums, but Chihuly is unique in that you are able to physically walk through the art, making for an immersive and spectacular experience. There is also a complementary photographer roaming around so you can get a photo of the entire group. My only complaint is that Chihuly is a bit pricy for the size of the museum. "
,,,,,"Covid precautions are also quite good-- Before entering all visitors must stand under a UV disinfecting machine, rooms are very large with high ceilings to allow for ventilation, and there are disinfecting wipes provided in some of the rooms. However, visitors often take off their masks for photos."
,,,,,"Also a tip-- ticket times are every 15 minutes, so visitors tend to show up in waves. If you want to feel like you have the whole museum to yourself, show up a few minutes after your entry time!"
,,,,,Must see! I'm not much of a art person but this place is stunning! Trying to find what else to do with the city pass and went ahead and booked this after the space needle.
,,,,,"I can't believe it took me this long to visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum. The glass sculptures are just incredible with rich, vivid colors. Don't touch anything and stand back, it would be easy to have an accident.  "
,,,,,"When we finished with the exhibit, we walked out and found a counter to order drinks and wood fired pizzas. The pizza hit the spot! Great way to spend an afternoon. Don't miss this one."
,,,,,"Breathtaking , informative, and all around out of this world experience. Each exhibit was diverse and brought you into a whole new world. The grounds are amazing and I can say Our visit to Chihuly was the best part of our Seattle stay!"
,,,,,Above and beyond service. Beautiful space. Interactive glass blowing session. One of Seattle's gems.
,,,,,"I was so excited as reviews were amazing. I was very underwhelmed. It is small took 15 minutes to finish.  It was expensive. The staff was rude. It was a bunch of glass bowls, giant marbles (like a kid would play with) and spears. I was SO disappointed with the entire place. :("
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden And Glass was one of the options in the Seattle City Pass. I am a fan of Chihuly but I had no idea how amazing this place was going to be. I anticipated walking through a smaller art gallery, the size of a museum room. That is not what I got at all. "
,,,,,Chihuly Garden And Glass is easily one of the top most gorgeous places I've ever been too. It is unreal. 
,,,,,I spent more time in here than the MoPop Museum and The Space Needle. There are so many pieces to look at and explore. I learned more than I even learned in my college art classes about Chihuly. Not only did it have his glass but it also has his paintings. 
,,,,,The flow of this place is unreal and effortless. It's more like a giant art gallery than a museum.
,,,,,They also have a really nice gift shop at the entrance and exit. 
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle I would make this one of my top places to stop by. Especially, if you're planning on being over by the Space Needle anyways."
,,,,,Absolutely stunning! Chihuly Garden and Glass does not disappoint. Gorgeous artwork in every indoor room that doesn't stop when you get to the outdoor garden. Must see in Seattle!
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"Beautiful glass artwork galleries by Dale Chihuly, plus a glasshouse and garden. We watched an educational glass blowing demonstration as well. Definitely worth a visit. Took about an hour but could have spent more time."
,,,,,"I'm not super into museums but I am into art and appreciate its many forms. So while researching things to do for our upcoming trip to Seattle, ""Chihuly Garden & Glass"", was at or near the top of every article we read. After learning it was located right next to the Space Needle (another attraction we were already going to check out) it was a no brainer. "
,,,,,"For starters, since we were going to be going here AND the Space Needle, it only made sense for us to purchase the combo ticket (which we did at the kiosk along side the entrance to the needle). It costs $49 per adult which saves you $18 bucks between the two attractions. If you're coming from the drop off area for the Space Needle, you can find the entrance to Chihuly off to the left along the walking path. "
,,,,,"As of this review, Chihuly is closed due to covid restrictions. Thankfully, we were here just before the shutdowns occurred. "
,,,,,"As you walk in you show your tickets to the employee, he/she will scan them, and off you go. You then make your way through a series of rooms showcasing some of the most amazing glass art you'll ever see. If you're a photographer (like me) you'll appreciate it as it's easily one of the most photogenic museums I've ever been to. "
,,,,,"Out in the Garden, two local artists held a demonstration on how these pieces of art are made. If they're doing this during your visit I highly recommended checking it out. It only took around 20 minutes or so."
,,,,,"At the end you'll make your way through the bookstore before hitting the exit. Here, there are many pieces of glass art for sale. I nearly purchased one but I wasn't convinced it would've made it back on the plane in one piece. Perhaps they have a shipping service? I just thought of that."
,,,,,I recommend this to anyone who's planning a trip to Seattle. Even if you're not into museums all that much (like me) I think you'll still appreciate the artwork displayed before you.
,,,,,"The Chihuly Garden is a fabulous museum for the ubiquitous glass artist, Dale Chihuly. The permanent collection shows you the evolution of his style and inspiration behind his work. I highly recommend listening to the free online audio guide on your smartphone to get a deeper understanding of the work. There is a nice cafe in the garden where you can enjoy pizza as well as refreshments. I also enjoyed the demonstration of the glass blowing process by an artist in the same courtyard as the cafe. It's definitely worth it to get the City Pass fro Seattle since this is included with The Space Needle and other attractions. Make your reservation ahead of time since they have restrictions on entry."
,,,,,"Worth every dollar. My husband and I always make a point to visit every Chihuly glass museum every chance we get, and Washington being his native state, we couldn't pass on the Space Needle and Chihuly museum package. This museum offers such a large collection of sea and Persian ceiling. Definitely recommend for anyone who loves beauty and admire the skilled honing by this artist."
,,,,,Stunning to day the least. We watched a live demonstration there. It was amazing! Highly recommend if you want to see something unusual and unique
,,,,,You have to see Chihuly.
,,,,,"If you are visiting Seattle, this is must see place. The museum is made for the art of one person,  born in the Pacific Northwest, and on a prime location just underneath the Space Needle. That's how important and impressive Dale Chihuly is. His art is monumental and the display is excellently executed."
,,,,,"If you are a local and have not come. Why? You must come and learn about Dale's formation, work, life, achievements and, more importantly, appreciate the art that is prominently displayed in this museum."
,,,,,"Entrance could get busy, so plan ahead. You will need about 2-3 hours to enjoy the museum fully, but don't get over confident. If you are visiting the Needle and Chihuly, I'd do Chihuly first because of the hours of operation."
,,,,,"They have narration that you can follow with your own phone. Bring earplugs for best experience. Make sure you take pictures! Lots of light, color and glass!!!"
,,,,,Spend a bit of time in advance to learn about Chihuly and his career so you have more appreciation for the work. The museum has excellent video footage but it is shown a bit too late in the exposition.
,,,,,We have also eaten a few times in the Museum's restaurant (not something we do in other museums) and it has been really good food.  Alternatives are plentiful in the nearby Seattle Center.
,,,,,"I have read reviews that complain about price and length (too expensive for the time it takes). I disagree. The price is fair if you consider the quality of the work, the specifics of how the art is displayed (the building was designed to display this art) and the vast number of pieces included.  If you are a museum goer that just wants to check the box, then don't visit. This is a museum to appreciate art and an artist that leaves color wherever his work his mounted all over the world."
,,,,,Being from Vegas I was familiar with the beautiful Belagio glass lobby artwork and was very excited to see more work from Chihuly. We reserved our tickets online and had no wait time once we arrived on a Saturday morning. All covid precautions were being followed and they had a UV scanner at the entrance. 
,,,,,The exhibits were beautiful! It was amazing to see how everything comes together. I also really enjoyed the short videos in the theatre of the making of the pieces. We also were able to see some glass blowing in person in the courtyard by some local artists. Very cool! 
,,,,,This is a must see for visiting Seattle!
,,,,,Definitely a place I would take my out of town guests to check out.  Beautiful glass work.
,,,,,What a lovely experience. I truly loved the experience of seeing this exhibit with my children (two 22yo & 16). I wasn't sure if they'd enjoy it but they did. The dark rooms really made the glass come to life. An absolutely must if your visiting Seattle you can also purchase tickets including the Space Needle saving $18.00.
,,,,,"I went to Chihuly on a rainy day recently. It was required to wear a mask inside. If you're a WA resident, you can purchase a discounted ticket at $27 (original price is $32). "
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle, definitely check our Chihuly. I especially love the transparent room where you can see Space Needle along with the art installation. I can't think of any other better thing to do on a rainy day!"
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,Absolutely breathtaking. This is a magical place and a must see if you are from or visiting Seattle.  I have attended events here and they are always first class.
,,,,,"The museum exceeded my expectations! What an amazing display of colorful and playful glass art. The sheer size of some of these pieces was just impressive. The garden area also had some pretty incredible displays, which felt like something out of Alice in Wonderland. Definitely a must see!"
,,,,,I visited a few museums in Seattle but I think the glass museum is the most worth it.
,,,,,The other ones seem to be a waste of time and money to me. The glass museum is on a whole different level. The glass work is so gorgeous.
,,,,,It does get pretty packed in each exhibit. That's probably the only thing I'm not into that it seems to exceed the capacity with covid going but I like that there is also a outdoor area.
,,,,,"I'm not really a museum person, but Chihuly Garden and Glass came too highly recommended to pass up. I visited this attraction as part of a bundle with the Space Needle. I enjoyed both components, but if I only had time for one, I would have to pick the Chihuly museum. "
,,,,,"I have seen some of Dale Chihuly's works previously, namely the glass flower ceiling in the lobby at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. However, glass flowers were only a small part of the entire experience. There were several ""*gasp* oh my god"" moments on my self-guided tour. The way Chihuly crafts his glass seems effortless and meticulously mimics nature. "
,,,,,I cannot recommend this experience enough. It was the perfect way to slow down and savor a lot of the beauty that Washington has to offer.
,,,,,"In town for business and pleasure. I had some time to explore downtown Seattle for the day and decided to check out Chihuly glass garden. It's located right on the foot of Space Needle and you get a discount if you get a ticket for both. I paid $34 for a Chihuly admission. As I went on Saturday the place was crowded and enjoyed the beautiful artwork, nonetheless. It was overcast/rainy day and the garden was pleasantly displayed. It was worth it."
,,,,,Super nice when it's not packed with tourist! (Guilty I be a tourist) . Stay for the glass blowing session outside
,,,,,"This place is truly awe-inspiring! Had no idea what to expect here, but Chihuly certainly doesn't disappoint.  Loved the informational movie where we got to meet the man behind the art. And the live demonstration was great to see!"
,,,,,"OMG, the art in this museum is breathtaking!!! I purchased a bundle ticket, and I couldn't be happier that I did as I would have missed the opportunity to experience such beauty. "
,,,,,"The same safety parameters implemented at the Space Needle were enforced at Chihuly Garden & Glass. My boys were so fascinated by the colors, and how a piece of glass can turn into majestic art. "
,,,,,"We really enjoyed the demonstration held showing how the process of how the glass is converted into art. This was a perfect way to end our day, and look forward to returning to view new installations in the future!"
,,,,,"This is something you just can't miss when visiting Seattle. It was stunningly beautiful, I've never seen anything like it. The outdoor glass garden is magical, you can sit and watch a glass blowing demonstration, there is also a small theater that tells about the artist which was super interesting. The whole area is a gorgeous park, there are lots of eating places in the Armory, the Space needle is in same area along with the Pop culture museum. You can spend an entire fun filled day there."
,,,,,Chihuly Garden is one of my favorite spots to visit in Seattle. It's a great place to come with friends and family. 
,,,,,"My favorite art piece is the 100 ft floral sculpture that's suspended in the 40 ft tall glass and steel glasshouse. The centerpiece emits hues of reds, oranges, yellows and amber. It's an absolute masterpiece! "
,,,,,Pricing 
,,,,,General admission and pricing will vary from Free to $32. Regular admission for adults from ages 13-64 will cost $32. 
,,,,,There are other package admissions that include admission into Chihuly Garden and Space Needle that start off at $49. 
,,,,,"I highly recommend getting the City Pass if you are looking to check out other places in Seattle such as Space Needle, Aquariam, Argosy Cruises Harbor Tour, Museum of Pop Culture OR Woodland Park Zoo, Chihuly Garden OR Pacific Science Center. (Please check if all are open online on their site) Adult tickets will run you $108 for the City Pass and you'll have access to all the sites above. "
,,,,,Have a safe trip and enjoy all the views!

,,,,,"Chihuly is such a necessary stop in the Seattle Center. Can't recommend it enough, the glass sculptures are GORGEOUS. I go once every couple of years with visiting friends. You can save $5 with your ID if you live in King County, or by purchasing tickets combined with the space needle."
,,,,,"My experience at Chihuly Garden and Glass was unpleasant. Social distancing was not enforced. It was overly crowded and I could not enjoy the artwork. People were rude, kept bumping into one another or were too busy trying to take photos to care if they were in the way or not."
,,,,,"I purchased the Chihuly Garden & Glass with Space Needle admission for $57 in advance and I was so confused about where to check in. I waited in line then I was told to check in with the ticket booth to provide them with the order #, then come back in line. It felt disorganized. "
,,,,,"The space needle was a much better experience. Chihuly needs to implement time slots so that social distancing is enforced. Yes, people are wearing masks but it is way too crowded. I would not come back on a weekend. I am sure visiting on a weekday would make for a much better experience."
,,,,,"Beautiful museum and well maintained gardens.  I really enjoyed seeing the pieces displayed in the garden against different flora and the blue sky.  I thought the ticket prices were a little steep considering the museum is fairly small, but we aren't in Seattle often so we are glad we came out."
,,,,,INCREDIBLE! So much talent and thought that went into creating this museum. Each piece is absolutely stunning. I can't believe the work that is showcased within the building and also the garden. Didn't want to post that many pictures to keep it a surprise. You will not be disappointed! The garden also has a perfect view of the space needle
,,,,,If you want to be truly amazed make sure you take the time to stop and spend a few hours at this museum. Very accessible and right in the middle of everything. Worth the price of admission.
,,,,,"Expensive but worth it. Like no other museum you've been to. Beautifully displayed, nicely lit, imaginative indoor and outdoor displays. Make sure to watch the ""hot shop"" glassblowing demonstration."
,,,,,Simply breathtaking! What a beautiful place. Highly recommended. Definitely go with the free audio tour.
,,,,,I liked the timed entrance to keep the numbers manageable for COVID. Went here a couple of weeks ago with my older Mom and didn't want to have crowds. We did plan a Monday visit and appreciated the precautions. They had a machine that was supposed to remove viruses or something before you went in. Everything was also touch-less. It's a good venue with tall ceilings so felt like we had lots of space. 
,,,,,Okay now for the exhibit. It was my second time but it was worth it. It really is breathtaking and I think maybe had some new items since I went last. I also went in the spring last time so the fall colors in the garden section really highlighted new things to me with the glass. It's so hard to capture in a picture but you still try to help remember the beauty. Plan to spend some time watching the videos it is incredible to see his process. What an amazing talent! It's expensive but so worth it.
,,,,,There's no way to show in pictures how beautiful the glass and gardens truly are. But I'm gonna try. If you're in Seattle I would definitely recommend going it's ming blowing!
,,,,,My daughter and I loved our afternoon at Chihuly Garden and Glass. The artwork was separated by several rooms. Each room brought something new and exciting to experience. There is a gift shop and a pizza restaurant available to guests at the end of the self guided tour. They were also putting on a full demonstration that shows how glass pieces are made. 
,,,,,Covid placed limited restrictions on visitors but for the most part the full experience is intact. All of the employees were informative and polite. They have several strolling photographers that offer to take free photos of visitors that are later posted to the website.

,,,,,"I visited on a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon (so the air conditioning was lovely). The line to get inside was quite long, as first we thought it was for people waiting to buy tickets in person... but alas it is just slow moving to get inside."
,,,,,The glass itself is stunning and the displays are very large. Is it worth the $33 admission price? I don't quite think so.
,,,,,It is VERY packed. You feel like you're in the way of traffic if you stop to pause and look at a display or read something. We walked through the exhibit in around 20 minutes... we spent nearly that much time in line.
,,,,,I wish less people were allowed in at a time so there wasn't pressure to keep moving so quickly. Art deserves more appreciation than that.
,,,,,I had been to Seattle many times before but had never gone to the space needle or glass garden and always wanted to. I took a trip recently and knew I had to go. It was absolutely stunning. Every sculpture was so unique and beautiful. I loved the actual garden and the mixture of glass and plants.  This is absolutely a must see if you are in town
,,,,,When looking up things that are bit different to see in Seattle the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit came up and it was such a beautiful sight to behold! Every sculpture looks like a beautiful delicate moment frozen in time. Except for the fact that I was constantly imagining something horrible happening to them in the back of my mind since this clumsy tourist is surrounded in very breakable pieces on all sides it was well worth it. Do yourself a favor and check it out - it won't take too long...perhaps an hour or so to just walk through at a leisurely pace and appreciate it all.
,,,,,Beautiful art from such a gifted person.  It's unfortunate that they didn't do more to control the crowd.  It was packed to the point of being uncomfortable.  If you are a person with any social anxiety it really detracts from the experience.  It is harder to appreciate all of that wonderful art with people bumping into you.  Perhaps the saving grace is the fact that the exhibit is a fairly short tour. I can appreciate the art in pictures just as well.
,,,,,"Wonderful Experience , By Yourself Or Shared With Friends. The Colorful Creations  Are Dreamy , Like From Another World"
,,,,,"The Chihuly Gardens & Glass Cafe Is Wonderful !! The Rigatoni With Wild Mushrooms Was Delicious . The Ambiance Is Fantastic , In The Shadow Of The Space Needle . The Music , Wonderful Service All Around .."
,,,,,Beautiful. Stunning. Elegant. Regal. Stupendous. 
,,,,,Take your time exploring and soaking it all in. Vibrant displays everywhere! At certain times during the day there are glass blowing demonstrations! 
,,,,,Located next to the space needle and museum of pop culture.
,,,,,"Breathtaking glass work, must see place in Seattle, love how its super open on the outside with a place to eat, drink, and rest."
,,,,,My BF and I bought tickets ahead of time online so only waited a couple of minutes to get in.
,,,,,"The whole exhibit takes around an hour, cost is $57 with space needle package."
,,,,,There is an audiobook you can listen to along the tour (download to phone via QR Code).
,,,,,"After the tour, we sat at the tables and grabbed some beer, def can stay here for hours relaxing while enjoying some good beer and views."
,,,,,"Food wise they offer pizza and appetizers, there is also a glass work demo every hour."
,,,,,Highly recommend checking this place out to enjoy a work of unique artwork.
,,,,,One of my favorite places in Seattle. It's small but it's very nice. Really love Dale's work. I would definitely recommend if you are doing a weekend trip to Seattle to include it. It's right next to the Space Needle and can be seen in 1 hour or so.
,,,,,"Chihuly Garden and Glass is one of the best art museums I have ever been to in my life. In my humble opinion, glassblowing (along with throwing clay) is the easiest art form to appreciate as you can more clearly imagine the process that went into making each of the pieces. To paint you a picture, imagine taking 20 pounds of molten glass, ready to melt through all the layers of your skin, and using your own breath and body momentum to bend, contort, expand, and meld it into something gorgeous, beautiful, and intricate. Each piece in this museum is moving, flowing, and ornately dangerous, just like glassblowing itself. Each piece seems carefully thought out and planned to fit amongst the others, however, it is quite the opposite. A couple of documentaries you'll view at the museum explains that the entire museum was created haphazardly, inspired by the unruly process of nature, and drawn together by raw feelings, emotions, and crude themes. If you come to Seattle and pass by this museum, you'll be sorely missing out on a life-changing experience. This is a museum for both the art critic and the person who has no idea whatsoever about what makes good art. At the end of it all, when you stand underneath a 1200 pound structure of seemingly lifelike glass forms, then you'll get a good understanding of the hype surrounding this museum."
,,,,,"Thankfully, the Seattle City Pass includes this museum as one of 5 Seattle attractions to provide a comprehensive tour of what the city has to offer (among the 5 include: the aquarium, the Space Needle, the Zoo, and of course, the MOPOP). As a side note, I absolutely recommend getting the city pass as it saves you nearly 100 dollars on entry fees to these attractions.  "
,,,,,"10/10 highly recommend this spot for their live glassblowing demonstration, monstrous art pieces, a gorgeous garden of rare plants that should not be overlooked, and presentation of something unusual in the heart of Seattle."
,,,,,Beautiful glass. Reminded me of the glass chandeliers in Venice. Also loved the class ceiling that was like a mini Bellagio. The glass bowls were cool too. Very unique glass structures in the garden. No social distancing enforced. Kind of a do it on you own things. Masks were enforced. I was surprised to see so many children in there because there is a lot of glass and no barriers. I grew up in Washington and this was my first time going and it was decently an experience.

,,,,,"The Chihuly Glass and Garden was one of my favorite places in Seattle. I purchased the same day combination ticket with the Space Needle because it was cheaper. The colorful glass sculptures were stunning, and all the pieces were photo worthy. The versatile installations included the right lighting to highlight vibrant colors and intricate shapes. There were some glass sculptures on the ceilings and were also incorporated in the garden. They also had a glass sculpting demonstrations. During my visit last month, masks were required, and reservation times were not required like other places."
,,,,,"A really cool museum and definitely worth a visit. Everything Chihuly creates is fantastic. There are several different exhibits, each featuring a different blown glass art piece. It was so beautiful and made me want some blown glass in my own home!"
,,,,,I actually proposed to my fiancé last Saturday here and it is gorgeous there. Please take the time to look in the glass house. It was probably my favorite. It was really cold to be outside in the garden but anywhere you walk there's something to look at. I think it's a must visit if you're visiting Seattle.
,,,,,"This glass art museum was amazing. It is so worth to see the art and learn about the life of a great artist. Really marvelous, the amount of time and effort put is extraordinary.  The photos and videos do not do justice. The color patterns and the shapes he was able to achieve with glass is wow. There is a small cafe with pizzas and some drinks. The day we went they had a live demonstration, which was cool. Make sure you go to the movie room and watch his work. It might take a maximum of 2.5 hours."
,,,,,"I had an amazing time!! Chihuly's glass sculptures are so beautiful, and although I was taken aback by the price for general tickets, I felt happier to learn the entrance includes gardens as well as a glass blowing demonstration. The whole space is well organized, and moving through it was easy. I especially appreciated the short videos presented in the theater. Got some amazing photos. Super unique; worth the price of admission."
,,,,,"The Chihuly Glass Museum is definitely a absolute must-see if you're ever in Seattle. It's mind blowing to think that all these exhibits are the work of one man's creativity and a lifetime of hard, dedicated work. "
,,,,,All exhibits intrigue the eye and are thought provoking!
,,,,,10/10
,,,,,It's touristy but I wouldn't call it a tourist trap since it's actually really cool! You can decide however much time to spend there and really make it your experience. We got lucky and found that there was live glass blowing starting soon just as we were about to leave. The demo was really cool and entertaining and was thoroughly explained. Great event for a rainy day in Seattle!
,,,,,"* as of Oct 25th you must be vaccinated or a negative test within 72 hours to get in most places. If you are doing both this and the Space Needle, go online and get the package which saves you money. You have 24 hours from when you do the space needle to do this. We decided to do them on 2 different days since our space needle was at 4:45p. Parking is very expensive. We saw them range from $20 to $60 since they had an event going on but we parked 2 blocks on Clay street by Kiro 7 and paid $.50 for every half hour! Be also aware this museum is NOT good for children that are into everything or like me, a mother with dementia who I had to look after like a hawk from touching anything.  Nothing can be touched, not even the stands or they will warn you that you will be asked to leave. The art is absolutely beautiful. The story behind everything he did and the whys makes you appreciate it more. From the glass art to his sketches and paintings. There is an outdoor area. They do sell food and drinks but you must stay in the designated area to eat and drink. There is also a glass blowing demonstration outside. A beautiful outdoor garden to stroll and a indoor movie area showing a number of movies of his history. This museum wasn't huge and probably with the movies, took us 2 hours to go through. Highly recommend."
,,,,,Absolutely beautiful exhibit and gardens! I had seen a few of Chihuly's pieces in Denver and really enjoyed them so to see a whole gallery was just stunning. It was a tad pricey for a tour but overall it was worth it!
,,,,,"Incredible experience. I came here with a friend and they had kiosks outside where we could buy tickets to either just the museum/garden or the museum and the Space Needle. We chose to go only to the museum/garden. I wasn't expecting much because I always thought Chihuly was overhyped, but I was definitely proven wrong. The sculptures inside this museum and in the garden were incredible and detailed, and I could tell how much work went into them. There was also a theater and a pizza place inside. We were lucky enough to catch a glass blowing demonstration, which was so cool. They made a vase right in front of us and talked us through the entire process."
,,,,,The only downside to this place was that it was fairly small. I would have loved to see more!
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"You've seen the iconic pieces all of Instagram I'm sure, but nothing is better than seeing their beauty in person. Truly awe inspiring though, the museum is a bit on the smaller side. "
,,,,,"Some extras include a theatre with videos of the artist's journey and developments in different countries, a cafe with actually decent food, and a few instructional shows displaying the techniques they use to make glass. "
,,,,,"Overall, very cool. And since it's right by all the other main tourist stuff and part of the CITY PASS, definitely worth a visit!"
,,,,,This is a repeat visit for me.  I get lost in the mastery of artwork and calmness that the grounds give me as I walk through the outside displays. I find something new each time I come.  I haven't made it in the evening to see how everything is lit up but next time...it's a must see!
,,,,,"These glass sculptures are truly magnificent, beautiful in every way. The exhibit is so tastefully done and integrated into nature. Well worth seeing if going to the space needle. Masks are also enforced. There is a spot to have lunch inside where they also do glass blowing demonstrations. Super fun!"
,,,,,Pretty cool museum to visit while in Seattle. There were plenty of rooms to go through and the price was fair. Definitely a good shot to check out if you're in the area
,,,,,The Gardens are just at the base of the Seattle Needle building. You can get a bundle ticket to go to both for a two-for-one kind of price. 
,,,,,"The Gardens have a security where the line forms at the entrance and guests will walk through some UV device to ""kill off bacteria"" before you go in. "
,,,,,The display provides details on the life and works of Dale Chihuly and his influence in creating these masterpieces. 
,,,,,"It's awe inspiring, the shapes and colors that he managed to put together! Lots of color and interesting life forms. "
,,,,,"It takes a good hour to go through the premises. They also have a good service inside, with a small bar to get adult beverages and refreshments. "
,,,,,"It's a very impressive and unique place to check out, worth visiting, especially if you're intending to also see the Seattle Needle :)"
,,,,,"There's nothing I like more than weird and this museum has it. Sure, there is all of the impressive handblown glass and cool lighting to accentuate it and informative behind the scenes videos. But then there's all the other stuff too. If you think his glass art is pretentious, go take a look at the other assortment of everything else. His collections and displays of various items. His drawings. The gardens. "
,,,,,I really can't imagine why this place would get a bad review. I was blown away (no pun intended) by everything. A huge must see for Seattle. I even recommend it over the Space Needle.
,,,,,AMAZING! Such beautiful artwork! The walk through the museum was great. I like that it was short because the artwork is so rich that any more would have been too much. The garden was stunning. The glassblowing demonstration was a nice touch.
,,,,,"If Seattle's famous overcast skies leave you feeling washed out, then Chihuly Garden and Glass will surely adds a splash of color to your day."
,,,,,"The long term exhibition features eight galleries and three drawing walls, and a lush gardens that serves as the backdrop of glass sculptures made up impossible shapes and unbelievably brilliant colors."
,,,,,"Is this worth the $33 admission price? Maybe a half of that. This is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Seattle, so be prepared for crowds. At 1:30pm on a Tuesday, there was a line, which, fortunately, moved quickly. At 3:30pm, that line multiplied by 20 and was stretching all the way around the block. Glad I wasn't stuck waiting in that under the scorching Seattle sun!"
,,,,,"The whole museum and garden walk will take you around an hour to explore, if you're being thorough. Not as many exhibits as I expected. "
,,,,,You have to wear masks while indoors. 
,,,,,"A professional photographer takes photos of all the guests on premises, while you browse the exhibits. These photos are complementary, and are included in your ticket price. You can view the photos on the museum website the next day. Really nice feature, as the museum is dark, so your phone won't capture the best photos. "
,,,,,"Every hour, a live demonstration takes place outside in the garden. Two craftsmen demonstrate the process of glass blowing and in 20 minutes create a small blown glass pot in front of your eyes. This was one of our favorite parts of our experience here. Definitely try to see this."
,,,,,"I knew it was going to be beautiful, but I was (glass) blown away! I was amazed and extremely visually stimulated. I could've stayed there for hours to catch all the detail of all the pieces. I was inspired by one of their postcards with the reflection of the Space Needle on one of the glass balls outside. I went back outside to go find more angles and beauty for more pics. I got a really good shot.  Thanks for the inspo Chihuly Garden & Glass!!!"
,,,,,Tourist tips: get the Seattle City Pass!! Do not park in the Seattle center open parking lot. It's $26 for 3+ hours. Such a rip off!!!! We were there early (before 11am) and got street parking adjacent to the open parking lot for $2.00 for 4 hours
,,,,,Go early! You can get a discount and it's simply not as crowded.

,,,,,This museum is the worth the trip to Seattle itself. My wife and I were absolutely blown away. The sculptures that are made and presented there are amazing. They are truly mind blowing and beautiful. The pictures I provided are just a small insight into the amazing items you will find when you visit. I truly recommend making the glass garden and space needle a trip together as they are so close and the park they are apart of offers more than just the two attractions.
,,,,,"Chihuly is from Portland Washington and this is quite a collection of his work. We bought tickets earlier and lined up.  Many of his work we have seen,  but all together here it's pretty impressive."
,,,,,We spent $25 sharing a lunch in the Cafe of one pepperoni pizza and a water.  The gift shop on the way out again familiar gift items for sale.
,,,,,"To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect, I bought the CityPass for Seattle and got five attractions included, of which I selected this Garden and Glass Museum. Check-in was a bit confusing, but I got in."
,,,,,"I must say, it's a beautiful venue with great exhibits. Like others have stated, it's a bit smaller than you would think, but it can still take up a good two hours of your time. "
,,,,,The exhibits are gorgeous and set up in a way where the colors pop and you can feel the sculptures come to life. 
,,,,,"I would, in a perfect world, love to come back when the sun is down because I imagine the outside garden with the glass sculptures would be even more vibrant."
,,,,,"While on the smaller side in terms of building size, the colorful & larger-than-life sized artwork more than makes up for it!"
,,,,,The intricate designs thought up by the now-injured artist Dale Chihuly push to the extreme the artists who execute his ideas. The artist leaves patrons' jaws agape in awe at the creativity and abilities of all involved who make this experience possible.
,,,,,"Chihuly's artwork has been on display worldwide from Seattle, WA to Chicago, IL, to Lewiston, NY to Washington, DC. Also in England, Finland, Ireland, Italy & Japan, just to name a few."
,,,,,"It was a gorgeous day in Seattle and I was able to enjoy the artwork both indoors & out in the gardens, along with the wildlife."
,,,,,"I was able to purchase t-shirts as gifts in the museum gift shop; however, there are numerous other gift ideas available via the web site with free shipping on domestic orders over $75."
,,,,,"If you have the opportunity to see the works of Dale Chihuly on display, take it, and make sure to share it with everyone you can. (More photos to follow!)"
,,,,,Bee-yoo-ti-full!! I was completely impressed by the artwork at Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every room was even more awesome than I had imagined. Completely surreal and you can really see the talent in every art piece. My favorite room was the Persian Ceiling. It felt like you were underwater. The outdoor garden was just as beautiful and it felt like something out of Alice in Wonderland. 
,,,,,There's a place inside where you can purchase food and beverages although it was a bit pricey for what you get. They also offer demonstrations of the art of glass blowing which was pretty cool to watch.
,,,,,"I'm generally not a big museum or art person, but this glass museum was pretty cool. The museum had a lot of big large pieces of glass artwork and it was really cool to see the level of detail of the art work. More so, I was interested that some of the displays had no barriers around it. I can picture Steve Urkel coming along, and destroying the place, with a classic rhetorical question of ""Did I Do That?"" making it a museum of the past. But in either case, definitely check out this museum. They have stuff outside as well, in a garden setting and the overall experience is fun. It's right next to the Space Needle, and you can even bundle tickets for a cheaper price."
,,,,,"beautiful! stunning! showstopping! I was hesitant about visiting chihuly for the longest time bc I usually hate paying for museums, but it was so unique and interesting that I'm willing to let it slide :) "
,,,,,"I absolutely LOVED the glasshouse + general outdoor area. on an overcast and temperate day, it felt perfect to be able to look up at the glass sculpture without having to squint, and also take a leisurely stroll through the garden without shivering. there are also nice sitting areas where you can kill time and wait for the glassblowing demo, while also taking in the lovely ambiance of the art around you. what a pleasant way to spend an afternoon!"
,,,,,"This is a must do if you come to Seattle. What an amazing exhibition. The place itself is not big, you can do it in less than 30 minutes. But, one exhibit is more breathtaking than the other. The have indoors and outdoors seating in the patio areas towards the end of the exhibition. Food wasn't my favorite, but I should have known better. You can get your tickets online and just show the pic at the scan. With your ticket you get Two complementary pictures of yourself and one of the place. They have a live show on glass making in the patio area. I do recommend going early in the morning so you about it the big crows."
,,,,,"I was so excited to see the museum, we spent 2 hours and still did not take time for the glass blowing presentation. I loved it all. "
,,,,,Take time for the theater as well as walk thru the cafe where all of his other collectibles are...so interesting (and sorta odd/funny too!)
,,,,,"While everyone was wearing masks, there were way too many people in the museum when we left. Social distancing was non existent. We were literally the first 10 people in at opening and trying to enjoy the gift shop as the last stop was impossible. "
,,,,,I would return though. Absolutely.
,,,,,"It's over the top art museum for it's art works here! Just stunning! The only thing I worry about is that it seems needs a little crowd control, there were quite a crowd in the same room sometimes and very close to the display which got my concern, these are irreplaceable arts that you don't want to destroy. Beautiful beautiful art works!!!"
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,"This place is absolutely incredible. Seriously, the pictures can't do it justice. Everything about this place is absolutely breathtaking. The exhibits are exquisite and the history you learn behind them will blow your mind. Don't even second guess going. If you have the opportunity to do so then take it!"
,,,,,Highly recommended.
,,,,,What is there not to like about the Chihuly Garden and Glass museum? The entire building is chock full of spectacular abstract glass art works. 
,,,,,Dale Chihuly is a prolific craftsman. His works say it all as do the pictures. A few examples are below. Go and enjoy!
,,,,,"One of the most unqiue glass galleries I've seen. Beautifully put together exhibition. Apparently everything is designed by Dale Chihuly himself, even down to the wall color called Chihuly Grey. "
,,,,,"It's not too big, and takes about 1.5 to 2 hrs to go through each room and read the descriptions on the wall. "
,,,,,Tips:
,,,,,1) Buy your ticket online in advance so you can skip the line (usually in the afternoon) 
,,,,,2) Join the free talks on the hour about different pieces of art work in the gallery
,,,,,"3) Glass blowing demo by the local organization Hot Shop 15 minutes past the hour in the garden area - fun for kids and adults. If you want to take a piece of glasswork home, they are on sale in the gift shop on the first floor of the Space Needle."
,,,,,"Amazingly beautiful glass art pieces that will dazzle your senses. There are so many different pieces to examine to be enchanted by Dale Chihuly's artistic ability. Your adventure begins outside the museum itself; just walking toward the building you'll see beautiful glass flowers calling to you. Each room and area in the museum represents a different grouping of his work, from under the sea to huge chandeliers hanging from the ceilings. Be sure to leave time to watch the videos that explain how his work is constructed or his thoughts behind the pieces; they give you a whole insight into his pieces. Room after room is filled with beautiful glass pieces."
,,,,,The garden is also filled with his works and is perfect for just sitting and contemplating on how to make your garden a little like this one! Having the Space Needle right next door and as part of the background of the garden doesn't deter from the beauty either! The mixture of the glass sculptures and the live plants lends to the wondrous beauty of the area. 
,,,,,There's a small cafe and eating area in the garden. You can sit and enjoy the area while enjoying a snack.
,,,,,"Purchasing your ticket online in advance will save you a couple of dollars, so it's worth the effort if you know for sure you're going. I had to choose a time slot for entry. The cost for entry runs from $19 to $35 depending on your age and time of entry. "
,,,,,Don't miss this museum if you're going to be in Seattle!
,,,,,"This was one of the best museums that I have ever had the pleasure of going to. I couldn't help but gasp at every corner we turned in the glass exhibits. It was great to explore the indoor exhibits as well as the outdoor ones. I would imagine that visiting this museum would never get old because different lighting would illuminate the spectacular pieces in various ways depending on the weather, time of day, and time of year. The exhibits were very accessible for my daughter who uses a wheelchair (with the exception of some doors).  The museum also has a nice gift shop with a large variety of shirts, books, art, and more.  I would definitely consider this a ""must see"" in Seattle. The whole experience maybe took us an hour. Can't wait to go back again!"
,,,,,We love art. We love glass. We love Seattle. This spot is a bucket list museum for sure and all the exhibits give you all the vibes. 
,,,,,Covid wise there are a lot of people so please be prepared for that.  There are some beautiful sculptures and even cooler stories behind the art. The outdoor area was my favorite and there were so many cool things. 
,,,,,"You can watch people actually make glass here and that is amazing. If I had known any better I would have gotten the city pass for all the Seattle goodies. The glass here is extremely unique and a complete work of art, and absolutely beautiful. Take your time and really get the information and facts from the artists and the museum space itself."
,,,,,If I could give this glass museum more stars I would !!
,,,,,"This artist is truly amazing I've never herd of him before until going here . His work is truly remarkable, some of the pieces will just blow your mind ! "
,,,,,The way they have each of his pieces on display are just so unique . 
,,,,,This is a place you don't pass up going to when your in Seattle !! We loved it
,,,,,"Tuesday, 7/13/2021 - Went to Chihuly Garden & Glass and it was beautiful!!!! This is right next to the Space Needle. This museum/ garden is absolutely beautiful! So clean, very artistic work, so unique and colorful.  It was breathtaking. Love it all! There's an area you can buy food and sit in the area outside right next to it. "
,,,,,"The garden is gorgeous with lots of unique, colorful, glass work. It's so pretty."
,,,,,"If you haven't been here, go check it out!!! It's very nice."
,,,,,"Once in while, there's a song, a taste of food, or a smell of fresh flower that takes you back to happier time.  At Chihuly garden I felt all of the above.  It's too gorgeous for words and I wouldn't even try.  Bottom line is, you have to be here in person to soak in the magnificent colors and intricate designs that mere mortals like me cannot begin to comprehend.  "
,,,,,"There's a lot of things to see for all age group. They garden is very relaxing with charming glass figurines.  I'm glad that I had attended a glass-blowing class at Blowing Sands Glass Studio several days prior to going here, because the complexities of glass blowing and color mixture is immensely complicated.  It makes me more appreciative of artists' dedication to their craft.  "
,,,,,I highly recommend Chihuly Garden and Glass.  
,,,,,What made the experience so memorable was that we were here around 4th of July weekend and it was sunny throughout the week.  The garden was so much more enjoyable on a sunny day.
,,,,,A beautiful exhibit in the heart of Seattle Center. 
,,,,,Food and drink are not allowed in as they don't want anything getting on the glass. 
,,,,,"When we arrived, the museum was pretty busy and packed with people. However, the line to get in was quick and easy as we had bought our tickets in advance. The staff that we did encounter were nice and those who were there as security to watch the patrons were professional and I barely noticed that they were there."
,,,,,The art and sculptures were absolutely stunning. I can't even imagine the time and precision that goes into making just a piece of the whole exhibit. I liked how the lights were dimmed and that there were spotlights focused on each of the sculptures. There is also an opportunity for a free photo in one of the rooms which makes for a great souvenir.
,,,,,"The whole exhibit was rather small and quick to get through, but I think that it was worth it to go at least once. When you exit the indoor part of the exhibit, you will then see a small courtyard full of people, tables and seats outside. In the courtyard, there is a stage where two people are giving a demonstration on how you make the glass. "
,,,,,Further on there are more beautiful glass art in the outside gardens. Each color and piece of glass were unique and added so much life to the area. You can also see the space needle right behind the gardens as it is right next door. 
,,,,,"Overall, I enjoyed the exhibit and how different each room theme was, but if you're looking for something larger this isn't the place."
,,,,,305 Harrison St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98109"
,,,,,An absolutely mesmerizing experience - who knew that glass could be shaped in such a soft and subtle manner. 
,,,,,The line was pretty atrocious to get into the museum even if you reserved a spot but it's expected because of how popular this visit is. 
,,,,,Definitely worth a visit - wear a nice pair of walking shoes!
,,,,,I have visited Seattle plenty of times and this is the first time I visited Chihuly Garden and Glass and I was honestly taken back by how beautiful all the glass sculptures were!!
,,,,,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking this place out. You will not be disappointed I can promise you that. I can say forsure that every time I come to Seattle with people who haven't visited the museum, I will definitely take them there. "
,,,,,"Also, they've got a sweet deal where you can purchase tickets for the glass museum and the Space Needle, which are two of the bigger attractions so I recommend hopping on that!"
,,,,,"A huge collection of beautifully-curated Chihuly glass sculpture.  As you wander from room to room, you will marvel at the huge scale and intricacies of the exhibits. Circle some of the displays to appreciate the unique details that emerge from various vantage points."
,,,,,"When you stroll outside, you'll see sculptures intertwined with the trees and vibrant blooms. Look closely at some of the opportunistically-placed sculptures and you'll even see the reflection of the Space Needle."
,,,,,"I'm not going to lie about my initial thoughts. I had seen some videos that mentioned the Chihuly Garden and Glass place and I was like meh about it. Looked nice, but didn't spark enough interest seeing it on TV. "
,,,,,"We ended up getting the City Pass (definitely recommend doing it if you want  to save some $$), and went here as one of the selections. I was blown away by the Chihuly exhibit. "
,,,,,"This place is so colorful and full of wonderful masterpieces. I love how throughout the place, you get to see how Chihuly evolved and went changing this art work. The vibrance of the exhibits draws you in and has you in awe. "
,,,,,"There are various rooms that show the different styles of glasswork and there is also a garden that has more exhibits, all that will leave you wondering how he did that. More than anything to me, the designs and the colors are what draw your attention and keep you glued to the next piece of artwork. "
,,,,,"All in all, I have to say that I was extremely impressed with his artwork. You really need to see it in person. Pictures don't do his artwork justice."
,,,,,Stunning. Otherworldly. Ethereal and yet explosive. 
,,,,,Go slow. Look at every angle. 
,,,,,"The audio tour was fantastic- and free! (Just use the QR code.) They also take complimentary pictures of you, which I found impressive. "
,,,,,Gift shop was a huge disappointment though. Why in the world do they sell only paper and fabric crafts in a glass museum??
,,,,,"A must see if you are visiting Seattle. Locals, if you haven't been you are doing yourself a disservice.  Chihuly is a world famous glass artist native to the area. His works are unlike any glass art you have ever seen.  "
,,,,,Cheers
,,,,,"Great addition to our Seattle trip! The art work was truly mesmerizing. In my short time visiting, it strengthened my appreciation for art work and the talent it takes to create something so beautiful! "
,,,,,Cons: I would be mindful bringing children sense the art work did not have a barrier. 
,,,,,Other con: Greeter was rude and had some snippy comments to the visitors walking into the first exhibit.
,,,,,My favorite art museum yet.
,,,,,I felt like I was transferred to another world where a vibrant and different way of life is lived. 
,,,,,The behemoth and gorgeous glass exhibits do wonders to contribute to the atmosphere of the museum and every exhibit as well as the garden is just magical. 
,,,,,"I definitely have a lot of respect for the team of artists here, seeing how much planning, creativity, and execution that must have gone into the exhibits and garden. "
,,,,,"You will definitely want to capture some memories as the environment created here is so unique and intense, and I think even the most tight lipped of people will find themselves in awe and wonder."
,,,,,"I went on a Monday in May and there weren't too many people but still a decent amount. There is a cafe as well as a gift shop. I wish they had smaller glass items that were more affordable for the average person, because they were selling some pieces but they were around several thousand dollars. I understand that it probably wouldn't be profitable but it would have been nice to take a small representative piece of Chihuly back with me to California, and I don't know, pencils and journals or coffee table books just wouldn't really do that for me. "
,,,,,Anyways! Enjoy and take some good photos!
,,,,,"Man, this guy must have been on serious acid or mushrooms while making these! Who can be this creative and talented?! Crazy with how unique, detailed and complex the glass art were. "
,,,,,"Amazing work! Such beautiful pieces. There's also a glass blowing demo outside. The gardens were also super unique and kinda weird, especially the glass art that look like snakes or aliens coming up. "
,,,,,I wish they had some small collectible sizes of the glass art for like souvenirs or for sale. Like a trinket. Unique experience.
,,,,,"A must-see place if you love art! Exquisite works of studio glass by Dale Chihuly are showcased. I like how the museum also incorporates the glasswork into an outdoor garden, giving a fresh perspective. An outdoor glass blowing demo occurs hourly and lasts about fifteen minutes. Show up early if you'd like to sit towards the front."
,,,,,"General admission tickets cost $30 in the morning and $35 in the afternoon. A couple of kiosks are placed outside the entrance for those that hadn't purchased tickets online. If using a special pass or discount, you'll be directed to the inside front counter. There was a long line at 2 PM but thankfully it moves rather fast."
,,,,,"The museum itself is not that large; rooms tend to display a big, central piece as the focus. It took us only about an hour to finish. I'm sure some people stay longer or appreciate the art more to get their money's worth. And as expected with such a crowd, it is difficult to take pictures without feeling rushed or portraits without other people in them."

,,,,,"I'm a huge botanical garden fan, so when it comes to hearing the word ""garden,"" I am all over it. To top it off, there are glass sculptures! "
,,,,,"When you walk into Chihuly Garden and Glass, you are immersed into a different kind of world. Despite the sculptures being made of glass, the forms flow in a way that makes you not see them as glass. The colors are so vibrant and the shapes aren't exactly what you expect when you hear glass. The amount of glass blown together to make these sculptures is mind blowing. I was in complete awe. My photos look great, but they don't even hold a candle to when you are there. I could almost feel myself diving into the water with some some sculptures made me feel, and these were just the inside exhibits."
,,,,,"When you walk outside, the glass house is a must. The flow of the beautiful glass looks more like a dragon as you walk below it. You even get a great view of the Space Needle. Outside of there, the glass sculptures are incorporated into the garden! Yes, it looks as if the glass just grew out of the ground like plants. It's done organically and nothing seems out of place. I was there for three hours and if I didn't have to catch a plane, I would've been there for at least 3 more. Oh! They also hold glass blowing demos in the courtyard and you can meet with the artist between demos and ask them about the art form. If you're in Seattle, make it a point to come here!"
,,,,,"This place is something else. It's unique, amazing, gobsmacking, a cornucopia of visual delight. An orgy of colors and twisted glass limb thingies .... You are definitely not going to regret walking through this wonderful display of art and craftsmanship."
,,,,,"I wish the museum had more displays showing the ""making of"" but regardless, enjoy the magic. At a very reasonable ticket price you can't spend a couple of quality hours here, or more if inclined."
,,,,,We had the CityPASS so we decided to go here for one of our stops during our Seattle trip. We went here on a Saturday earlier this month around 12:20pm and it was a little crowded since lots of people stopped to take pictures. This place has a lot of glass sculptures made from glass blowing.
,,,,,"The artwork here is beautiful! I liked how it's not just small sculptures, but there were huge sculptures hanging from the ceiling too! Some of the different glass sculptures was in a group of other sculptures, so it's not just randomly placed there for no reason. Most of the sculptures are indoors, but there are a few which are outside around the building. There's also a glass blowing demonstration outside if you want to learn about how these glass sculptures are made!"
,,,,,I'd recommend this place! It was very fun seeing the different designs and shapes. I also enjoyed the HUGE flower sculpture near the end in the room with the glass walls! Lots of people take selfies and group pictures in that room and it was probably my favorite room from this experience!
,,,,,This was one of the most beautiful places I've ever been.  The glass artwork is amazing.  I highly highly recommend coming here to see the beauty.
,,,,,A must see when going to Seattle!
,,,,,I parked across the street in the paid parking lot. 
,,,,,I highly suggest getting the bundle and get tickets for the space needle next door as well! 
,,,,,The glass sculptures are mind blowing and insanely beautiful! There's a short demonstration of glass blowing at the outdoor eating area! I recommend sitting and watching how the sculptures are made! 
,,,,,Glass blowing requires a lot of work and learning about the process makes you appreciate the sculptures even more!
,,,,,Was pretty cool to see all the glass pieces. Got a discount as we bought the space needle and this place together. 
,,,,,It's smaller than I expected but still alot to see. The glass sculptures and prices were amazing to look at. 
,,,,,They also had a demo on how they blow and make the glass almost every hour. Pretty cool. They also had a movie room but we skipped that as it was crowded and we didn't feel like waited for the next one to start. 
,,,,,We did get a pizza there to eat while watching the demo on glass making and for $16 we thought it was a good value but when opened the pizza box it was more like a flat bread and covered maybe half the box. So less of a value that we originally thought but it was very good. I guess it's average for a tourist attraction place. 
,,,,,But I recommend this activity. It's right next to the space needle so very convenient to do both in the same day.
,,,,,"Such a beautiful stop on, its a must see if you are visiting Seattle."
,,,,,There are so many beautiful pieces of glass you almost feel like you should be able to be so close to them.  Right from the start you are greeted with beauty and there are so many photos you want to take.  Highly Instagram-able if you are into that.
,,,,,There are several rooms with different installations and stand alone pieces.  Sit and stare at the beauty of each piece and the wonder of creating such sculptures out of glass.  Outside you will find pieces intermingled in the landscape.  The glass foliage really shines on a sunny day. It almost feels like an alien planet at times.  Just beautiful.
,,,,,"Pictures do not do it justice, make sure you visit!"
,,,,,Pro tips:  
,,,,,Save and buy tickets for the space needle and Chihuly together. 
,,,,,"Use the restroom before entering, there isn't a convenient one once inside."
,,,,,Ride the monorail from DT for easy access.
,,,,,I have heard great things about this place and was so excited to see it when I visited Seattle! It is absolutely gorgeous inside and the sculptures are breathtaking and stunning. There are certain parts of it where you can see the glass sculptures and the space needle! 
,,,,,Highly recommend!
,,,,,Pretty Glass
,,,,,Cool Class
,,,,,Sketchy Glass
,,,,,Amazing Glass
,,,,,"The glass here is extremely unique and a complete work of art. There are different samples from artist over time each with a certain sculpture or story. Looking into each of the stories behind each piece was exciting for history buffs and artsy minded people. The colors were very pretty and definitely will make you say oooo and ahhhh. The outside garden portion was also nice with decorative glass mixed in with plants to bring more attraction. Of course you can't touch anything, but just looking and learning is definitely a focus here. Check it out after leaving the space needle."
,,,,,I think that this place is conveniently located in Seattle Center but I think that the glass museum in Tacoma is more worth seeing. It look me about 10 minutes to see the entire exhibit and the glasswork at the Museum of Glass has a lot more variety. 
,,,,,All the pieces here had a lot of similarities and but the theme still was not clear. It was almost $70 for two people and my husband was not super impressed either. I am leaving four stars though because it was conveniently located and also something to do on the weekend.

,,,,,Clearly a Seattle staple For a reason.
,,,,,The classic Caribbean pork sandwich is amazing. Definitely messy so grab lots of napkins.
,,,,,"Heard it was the best; even says ""Best rated sandwich in America."" I'm finding more and more if they say that, then it's not that good."
,,,,,"Lettuce seemed to be fresh, so thats good."
,,,,,The sandwich was very sloppily assembled; the sautéed onions were just sorta stuck to the side of the bread in the to go wrap.
,,,,,"The meat was pretty sad. A poorly hand formed wad of wet roasted pork. Resembled the texture of canned tuna fish. For such a great cut of meat, it's sad to see it end up in this form and texture."
,,,,,Bread was pretty firm which helped keep it from falling apart from all the moisture in the meat; didn't really get that wet bread mush feel.
,,,,,"Overall taste was okay, maybe a little too sweet."
,,,,,"It's listed as cheap but idk who considers the lowest price of $11 for a sandwich cheap, w/e."
,,,,,"Fortunately, there is much better food nearby for that price."
,,,,,"Sandwiches, instead of ""meal,"" is what you do here.  Then, there is no escape to compare this one to Un Bien.  By the way, what's up with all those Paseoes popping up?"
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast is an excellent, satisfying, messy, near perfect sandwich.  I think it is less greasy than Un Bien, whose equivalent is also in the same category.  Honestly, I will go either one based on the travel distance and no much else.  Yes, I am basically saying they are about the same."
,,,,,"The baguette bread gives the chew and structure. The meat was very nicely braised.  The aioli was creamy and flavorful.  The condiments was crunchy with just the right amount of kick.  Before I knew, I finished that thing that can probably feed two people."
,,,,,"A tip, it actually reheat well in microwave."
,,,,,tip #2.  The place does not even have a sign.  You might just walk past it without knowing it.
,,,,,Visitors came.  Visitors visited the most famous sandwich shop in Seattle.  I couldn't go with them.  What do I do?  I asked them to bring back an order of Caribbean Roast Entrée.
,,,,,"Well, not bad.  But also not very interesting.  It was well marinated pulled pork on rice, some normal greens, and a bowl of bean sauce.  The portion was big.  It was good value.  But it did not inspire."
,,,,,"Visitors said the sandwich was ""very good."""
,,,,,Next time I will grab a sandwich and revise my review.  Maybe.
,,,,,Overhyped and pricey.. had corn and tofu sandwich.
,,,,,Corn was bland nothing special.. Make sure you get a lot of napkins..
,,,,,Food - 2/5 
,,,,,Service - 0/5
,,,,,"I leverage Yelp a lot when choosing where to go grub, occasionally I'll write a review. I'm not a 3/5 reviewer, I'm either a 5/5 or I want to send a message to management or what not. Note, I do not have any ax to grind with Paseo, I've been to this location a few times before, and also frequented the location down in SODO. Always had a good experience, food meets expectation and the service is adequate. Basically food comes out when it needs to and the order taker says please and thank you, ya know, basic stuff."
,,,,,"This time it was different. My wife is pregnant, and 7 months, so it's fairly clear that she is with child and not hiding a little bump. Because of this, I like to take extra care when eating out, cause not sure if y'all know, but pregnant women really get the shaft when it comes to eating."
,,,,,"Upon arrival to Paseo, it was basic, place is small, used to be cash only but it's clean enough. There's a gal at the front, (hate to put you on blast, but seriously, you need a wake-up call if this is how you portray yourself to a willing and paying customer). "
,,,,,"I asked her in the most friendly, not extra way ""Is the aioli home-made and/or does it contain raw egg in it?"" I got a nod, which I wasn't too sure if that addressed the first half or the second half of the question. I repeated the raw egg part and she says yes. Alright, understood. I mention, ""my wife is pregnant, so you know I just got to make sure."" I do this for mainly one reason and it's this, ""listen, my wife is pregnant, aka our unborn child is susceptible to food borne illness and I would sincerely appreciate it if you and your team took extra care when preparing our little sandwich, so like if you can ensure it's hot and not cross contaminated that would be SWELL"". "
,,,,,"The look that She gave me after I said this was pretty much, IDGAF what the hell do you want. Now, if this was the Attic in Madison Park, or KATZ deli in Manhattan where the staff is known to be a little rough around the edges, I would have let it slide. But nah, this is a 20 something year old that's working the counter at a pretty ""established"" sandwich spot in Seattle. At this point I'm kind of taken aback, usually at the cross roads of, is this place even worth my business and should I leave, or I'll just pull the trigger and see what happens. So I went with choice # 2, damn I was hungry and I just wanted to get the food and knew in my heart that a Paseo sandwich when made right can really hit the spot. Boy, should I have listened to my gut."
,,,,,"My wife asked another question about the bowl she eventually ordered, and was just like ""hey does this contain anything raw in it that I need to know about, She provides an adequate left to right nod. Not sure if her throat was hurting her, but I think I would have gotten more out of her if I had used sign language. "
,,,,,"I've worked in the service industry and have had her exact job for nearly two years in my past life. I know what the days can be like, but hey you signed up for this. Idk what to tell you. Maybe she was filling in? Maybe she had something going on at home? All possible, and I understand it. But when the person on the other end of the counter is doing that thing that we all do, you know it, you act extra nice to the person taking your order, hoping they'll turn a new leaf. That's your queue to pull yourself together and snap out of it. I'm one of the people that always tips an order taker, cause I've been there and I know that when people do it, it compounds and you end up getting a little payout at the end of the week. So I threw a few bones, thinking that I'll pay it forward, cause I'm sure someone did it to me. But alas, it didn't affect the quality of the food. "
,,,,,"F it, I order the press, knowing what its going to be like. My wife orders the Caribbean bowl or whatever. It comes out and I know the Press is ""supposed to be messy"" but damn this thing was just a slop. You can tell when something is put together hastily, and this is it. I mean sht dude, it's a sandwich, how hard is it to make it presentable? Maybe put like half a minute of effort into it. It wasn't even hot. My wife's ""bowl"" was basically two scoops of rice and a ton of meat on it (bonus points for it being a ""good value"" I guess?). And just sauce drenched on it. "
,,,,,"It wasn't hot either, which is probably not surprising considering they just put the meat in a warming pan and serve it. I'm rambling and honestly if their management reads the reviews at all I'm sure there's some actionable items to take away from it. But hey, I don't see much responses below so they probably won't. But if your debating between this and that other spot that has the same menu. The other spot was the winner, and I tell you what the guy that took my order acted like the owner. And that, my friends is the key. Guaranteed he wasn't, but damn sure he was trying to make the experience hospitable."
,,,,,CIAO
,,,,,"Came here by recommendation from a friend who had visited this place before. Per the recommendations on Yelp, we ordered Caribbean Roast and Paseo Press. The Caribbean roast was good - good bread and tender meat, but, in my personal opinion, it was lacking in flavor. Paseo Press was pretty delicious (it was the ham that brought more of a flavor)."
,,,,,"If I came here again, I'd pass the Caribbean roast and get the Paseo Press."
,,,,,"WOW!!! The Caribbean roast. It is a definitely a top contender on my list of best sandwiches I've ever eaten. In fact, it's probably at the top of that list. It really is that good. It basically is a Banh Mi Vietnamese style sandwich, using the same type of bread, smothered in aioli sauce, and filled with tons of caramelized onions, juicy pulled pork, jalapeños, and cilantro. The whole concoction sounds so simple, yet it completely knocks any Banh mi I've ever had out of the water. Gosh, I'm salivating here just thinking about it."
,,,,,"The sandwich gets MESSY, with onions and pork trickling out with every bite. But I don't care. It just means another opportunity to eat the fallen. My hands are completely covered in the sauce and oils after a few bites. But I gosh darn don't care. I could bathe in the sauce and it wouldn't matter to me, as long as I'd get to enjoy the entirety of this heaven-sent sandwich in peace."
,,,,,"Now, Paseo is an unassuming little hole in the wall, discreet unless there's a long line out in front, which I've heard there can be. Luckily, however, both times that I've been I've never had to wait! Seating is very limited inside but I've gotten lucky both times as well. "
,,,,,Bottom line: Paseo's Caribbean roast is definitely a MUST when in Seattle.
,,,,,So flavorful and juicy! Everything I've ever wanted in a sandwich!!! Highly recommend
,,,,,A trek away from downtown Seattle but well worth it.  Sandwich is juicy and full of flavor. Need to be eaten immediately.  Corn is really good too
,,,,,"Tiny hole in the wall not much seating but fantastic food! Ordered a sandwich & a spicy red sauce dish with rice & fish. Great flavor and taste. I have been back several times, had the plantains they are a must! Their black beans are delicious and can be a meal themselves. The bread is clutch! as close to good cuban bread as you can get here. It has great value for your money, even packed they serve fast! seating like I said is limited but not a big deal."

,,,,,"It's  a very small dinner with 2 outside dining benches. However, it offered very good and mouthwatering dishes and sandwiches "
,,,,,It's simply a good food place in a chill neighborhood.
,,,,,We were on our way from Vancouver to Portland and it happened to be approaching lunch time. We were nearing Seattle. Yelp to the rescue! Which one place has the most reviews? Ignore the $'s. Ignore the *'s. Ignore the cuisine. Don't even look at the pictures. Ignore the menu. Just go and order the most popular item! It almost always works!
,,,,,"I have to admit, I was quietly thinking ""what's the big deal? It's just a sandwich shop?! Are these Seattle-ites just not on their culinary game?"
,,,,,"Anyway, we followed our formula, got off the highway, completed the long search for a parking place, and began our wait in a lengthy line on the sidewalk. Luckily, I quickly checked my wallet and we had enough cash to eat! Heads up - no credit cards are accepted."
,,,,,"We both ordered the most popular item, a caribbean roast sandwich, after confirming our plan with other salivating regulars in the line."
,,,,,"I have to say, this was the most flavorful, succulent, tasty and filling sandwich we've ever had. Period. I don't know how they marinated the meat, made the sauce, baked the bread, or did anything. But, OMG it works. "
,,,,,Can we open a franchise in Tampa? Please? Pretty please?
,,,,,Get the Caribbean pork roast sandwich.  It's messy but oh so good.
,,,,,"I arrived 15 minutes after they opened at 11AM Thursday and had two people in front of me.  While waiting about 15 minutes for my order, the line and crowd started getting longer and bigger.  They've been open for half an hour and it was already busy."
,,,,,"Since there's only a handful of tables inside the little shack of a shop, I took my order to go and headed to Kerry Park.  Go there and take in the view as you devour the flavorful delicious sandwich.  The sandwich was huge!  It was full of pulled pork, thick grilled onions, and some lettuce. "
,,,,,"I tried to go back on my last day in Seattle to bring a sandwich home, but they're closed on Mondays.  Bummer."
,,,,,Parking is street only and they only take CASH.
,,,,,"You know how in every city, there's always at least one or two restaurants that get SO much hype that you just have to try? Well, Paseo Caribbean Food is one of those restaurants. Featured on different websites such as Eater, Paseo definitely got my attention."
,,,,,"Paseo is very accessible my car or by public transportation. We took a bus from UW and got to Paseo in about 15 minutes and walked a bit under 5 minutes to get to the restaurant. The place itself is very small, as others have commented on - with only a few tables inside - but there's a large table outside if you have warm clothes. On a weekday, you shouldn't worry about traffic if you come early. We got here around 1130am and took up the entire table outside."
,,,,,"Their menu is divided into two different types of food: sandwiches and plates. I was immediately drawn to their most famous sandwich, their classic caribbean, pulled pork sandwich. It was only around $10, so definitely affordable. I ordered one while my other friends did the same."
,,,,,"Food came out relatively quickly and first impressions was... DAMN this sandwich is HUGE, bigger than Trump's mouth. In terms of portion size alone, it's worth your money. The sandwich was also VERY greasy, and so I just took a knife and fork and ate it the clean way."
,,,,,"In terms of taste, this sandwich hits the spot. I don't think I have ever had that pulled pork that good before. The sandwich was very simple, but the lettuce, meat, mayo, and jalapenos did the trick. The grilled onions inside were also an amazing addition."
,,,,,"Overall, this sandwich spot deserves all the praise that it gets from customers. For the price, you can keep coming here and find yourself in heaven. "
,,,,,"Eat well and prosper,"
,,,,,"I think this might just have been the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. Not to spoil this tip for everyone, but I can't help but gloat when I say that I bypassed the 2-hour line by simply calling and getting my sandwich 10 minutes later."
,,,,,"I would do so many things for one of these sandwiches on my lap: pay $50 bucks, run to Seattle from San Francisco, kill for a man... they're just THAT GOOD!!!!"
,,,,,Oh my god. This was literally the best thing I ate during my trip to Seattle. I HAVE DREAMS ABOUT THIS PLACE. The meat was soooo moist and tender. The rice was flavorful and delicious. Who knew something that is usually so plain could be so good? The beans though.... oh my gosh. I've never had beans like this before. I'm from Texas and I have been eating beans my entire life but these were different and I wish I could describe how good they were but you really need to try it yourself because anything I say would truly be an understatement. 
,,,,,This place is pretty busy! Lots of people in line but they are quick to get your order and food out.
,,,,,"Yeah, its good and I'd go again.  Think I ordered a dud but my wife liked her food.  They want me to add more to the review so I will add this much more."
,,,,,Hi Gerald! 
,,,,,We're sorry to hear it sounds like you didn't enjoy your meal at Paseo! We would appreciate hearing more about your visit. Please email us at 
,,,,,"This was a 4-napkin sandwich. (Maybe I've invented a new rating system.) I never need a napkin to eat a sandwich, but the serving was so generous that the tender pork and sauce kept falling out of this sandwich. Service was lightning fast, and staff were cheerful and the vibe was fun: cramped, hole-in-the-wall, yell-your-number-out when the food's ready kinda place "
,,,,,"I was expecting more spice and flavor... I was well into the second half before I got any heat. But the bread was exceptionally good, chewy, and delicious. The sauce was lackluster, but the caramelized onions were great."
,,,,,"Overall, well worth my money."
,,,,,So girlfriend wanted to come to this sandwich shop because it has sat comfortably on the list of the top 5 of Yelp's Top 100 restaurants in the last few years.  
,,,,,I am always game when it comes to eating good grub and I too want to see what the hype is all about.

,,,,,"Love this spot, it has been a go-to for years now. The cuban style sandwich has never disappointed, not once. Service can be rough, and seating is a joke, but the quality of the food is completely worth it. I've tried plates as well as various sandwiches and even fish. They're all good, but none will draw me away from that sandwich at this point. I make it a point to go here every time I'm in town."
,,,,,"This has been on my list of things to try in Seattle for a while. Unfortunately it didn't blow me away. I was so disappointed! My husband and I split the two most popular sandwiches, the Caribbean roast and the paseo press. I can't complain about portion sizes...they were huge. Very messy though and hard to eat. The Ingredients were very fresh and there were tons of meat on each. The flavors just didn't wow me. I was expecting more spice, flavoring, etc. The small spread of aioli got lost with all the meat. The bread also was just too much and kind of hard. The meat itself just wasn't very flavorful although it was super tender. If you love meat and sandwiches, it's worth a trip. But for me, it was a miss and I wouldn't come back."
,,,,,"I went back here a few months ago post ownership change and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The bread was not fresh, the onions were not flavorful as they used to be, the meat was dry. It was very disappointing. I thought I may have been crazy and just mistaken on my first visit, but then I finally found out later that Paseo had been overtaken by new owners and that the previous owners went and opened a new place called Un Bien. I have not yet been to Un Bien but I look forward to it after the really sad and disappointing experience during my second visit to Paseo."
,,,,,One of the best sandwiches I've ever had (carribian roasted pork) and super cheap.
,,,,,"Terrible slow, two girls at the front are rude and talk to each other over taking orders. I stood at the counter for 5 minutes while they talked before asking what I wanted. Then took another 20 minutes for the food."
,,,,,"Great lunch spot!!! Huge portions and very fair prices! The sandwiches are loaded with meat, but would have appreciated more seasoning to give eat sandwich a more distinct taste. Perfect spot to pick up lunch on the go to one of the many parks in the area."
,,,,,"Fremont sandwich joint is good. It's not the same as  the old days. Better Cubans can be found out there. Not worth a long line wait. I miss the days of phoning in an order and cash only. But yes, tofu sandwich is good. Caribbean fries are good. Pork sandwich is good."
,,,,,Been a fan of paseo prior to the whole fiasco couple years back and will say like many others... it's just not the same. 
,,,,,"With that said, it's still a very solid establishment serving equally as tasty Caribbean food. Usually get the roast, but a sucker for the scallops in red sauce. "
,,,,,I always bring out-of-state friends and they are always impressed! 
,,,,,"Btw... this is how you meal prep, right?"
,,,,,Super fire. Extra napkins for your sandwich. Once you pick it up you cant put it down. Grab and sandwich and hit Fremont Brewery. If you're lame hit the troll. The Sammy and Brews is all you need.
,,,,,"Hi Tanner, thank you for your review! We're so glad you enjoyed your visit to Paseo. We offer some great canned beers at our Fremont location and a full bar at our SoDo location for all your Sammy and Brew needs! :)"
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast was good! We got it to go, and ate it at Kerry Park. Definitely get some of the habanero sauce (not the Tobasco one) in a to-go container. It went really well with the sandwich!"
,,,,,"If you're driving here, park on a residential street and walk over. :)"
,,,,,My favorite sandwich is the muffuletta from Cochon Butcher in New Orleans but the Caribbean roast at Paseo gives it a run for it's money! 
,,,,,"Arriving around 1:15pm on a weekday, the line to order was pretty reasonable. After about 10 minutes, I was inside the bare bones shack placing my order. Since it was my first time, I was advised to try the Caribbean roast ($9.75), which is their best seller. And, I got a high-five from the guy at the cash register!"
,,,,,"If there was any hope for a quick in and out to grab the sandwich, I was definitely mistaken. I waited on my number to be called in a line that snaked along the side of the building for about 40 minutes. Thankfully, the wait was worth it."
,,,,,"The pork was probably the best that I've had! Marinated, slow-roasted pork shoulder with caramelized onions, cilantro, and aioli was stacked on a crusty baguette. It was a cross between a pulled pork sandwich and a banh mi. But, it was better than both! The pork was so tender, so juicy, and so flavorful that I could've eaten an entire plate of it alone. The lettuce added a little crunch and the aioli, cilantro, and caramelized onions really meshed well, helping to create a cohesive sandwich."
,,,,,"Located in the Fremont neighborhood, a few miles from downtown, Paseo is a place not to be missed. Voted #2 on Yelp's list of best places to eat in the US, this Caribbean food joint really produces a fantastic sandwich."

,,,,,You KNOW the meal is going to be bomb diggity when it's served on a Chinese red plate. I still dream of this sandwich. I wish there was something like this in California :( 
,,,,,I ordered the Caribbean roast and oh my gosh... the best sandwich I have ever tasted. It was meaty. It was spicy. It was messy. It was saucy. What more can I ask for?!! 
,,,,,"I also tried the prawns with red sauce and rice, we got extra spicy and the spice is reeeaaaal with this place so if you don't like spicy food then this dish might not be for you. "
,,,,,"If you are a local, I am so jealous. If you are a tourist, you HAVE to visit this place. The sandwich is unforgettable."
,,,,,"Tasty, but very messy :) I wish I could've eat this sandwich at home. But in a Warehouse with nasty dirty work hands wasn't easy. I am really am not complaining about the messiness, I just wouldn't recommend eating it in your car. It's really good food though!!  I wanna go back to try other things on the menu."
,,,,,"The prawns sandwich was amazing, the spicy mayo sauce really packs a kick, despite only getting the first level of spiciness. should definitely eat it right away because the bread would get soggy if you don't, but having soggy and well absorbed bread is really good as well."
,,,,,"As for the caribbean roast, i feel it doesn't live up to its reputation as the most popular menu item. The lettu"
,,,,,"the restaurant  itself is really small, and finding a seat can be really hard. but service is usually really fast."
,,,,,Finally got a chance to test the comparison to Un Bien. 
,,,,,"I went halfsies on a Paseo Press sandwich with my friend who was visiting Seattle. There are definitely differences in taste in comparison to Un Bien, and much rather prefer both the toast and firmness on the bread at Un Bien. The flavor of the grilled meat and onions were okay on the Paseo Press, but I feel like there was so much more potential there. The price isn't too bad either! "
,,,,,"Un Bien 1, Paseo 0"
,,,,,"This is a unique sandwich, with unique flavors and the service was superb. "
,,,,,They were out of the most popular #2 which was a major bummer because I'm from out of town and who knows when I'll be back. I struggled with what to get instead and discussed with the gal at the cashier who was making suggestions. The dude next to her piped in to say they'd make a special version just for me (I guess they could see the real struggle I was having lol). I got a paseo press with grilled pork in it (basically a grilled pork & paseo press conjoined sandwich)
,,,,,The style of the pork certainly surprised me. It was almost like a grilled patty - very easy to bite and chew and tons of flavor. The aioli was awesome. Cheese was awesome. Jalapeños/banana peppers of course awesome. The onions were huge and I ended up leaving them behind. 
,,,,,"I wish they could make it less greasy/wet somehow. My bottom bread slice was soggy which I hate. I ate the sandwich mostly open faced. But hey, at least I saved the calories (like you can even consider trying with this sandwich :p)"
,,,,,This place was just....ok. maybe this is a case of overhyping... I don't know. 
,,,,,"I come from Los Angeles Angeles just south of there in the small port town of San Pedro is a small sandwich shop called Busy Bee market. This sandwich shop compared to chains like subway, Jersey Mike's, firehouse, Jimmy John's, Togos etc. Is a solid 8/10."
,,,,,Compared to busy bee however this is a 5 at best. I know this is an unfair scale but if you are going to go around boasting 5 stars with over 4500 reviews then you better bring your A game. My sandwich experience today unfortunately did not. 
,,,,,Service was good. Experience was nice. But I judged against the true sandwich king so I can only give this place a 3 star review.
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Found this place via Yelp.  Interior is nothing special.  I was blown away by the flavors and the presentation; I had a Caribbean bowl. Full of flavors, and enough food to satisfy my hunger. Good job guys, definitely 5 stars."
,,,,,Looking for something other than a salad or deli sandwich type of lunch?
,,,,,"This place is a treat. Fantastic authentic Caribbean food. You get it quickly and the service is friendly and no-nonsense. After passing this place about 100 times without giving it a second look, I finally went in. Since then, i go once a week and I always bring friends. "
,,,,,Get anything with the caramelized onions!!!
,,,,,"So many people rave about this place so naturally we had to try it. They have a great few options for seafood sandwiches too so that's always a good sign. I've had both the prawns and the Alaskan cod in the two times I've been here and my bf has had the #1 (most famous) and #2 (more hammy version of #1). All in all, our reviews would be the same in that the sandwiches are just too oily. The oily onions come pouring out as soon as you unwrap the sandwich. It's kinda hard to taste the true flavor of the meat/seafood when all you taste are onions. We really wanted to like this place which is why we returned for a second time and both also tried different things, but I don't think we can take the oiliness :/"
,,,,,This is the only Caribbean food I have tried since I have been in WA but this place is amazing! There is so many options that you have to choose from that are all amazing! There is a great groupon deal as well! Love this place
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast is the thing to get here. Lots of pork and yummy caramelized onions, but beware that it's definitely messy to eat. The sandwiches are pretty large so I would recommend sharing a sandwich and a side dish between two people. My friend and I share the Caribbean plus a side of shrimp over rice and that was more than enough food for us. The shrimp was really yummy but the sauce was quite spicy and this is coming from someone who loves loves loves spicy food. "
,,,,,"The place is pretty small and probably only seats 12-14 people, but they do have a couple of tables outside. On a 35 degree weather day though, you're probably better off waiting for a table to clear inside or taking it home to enjoy so that your sandwich's yumminess isn't depleted by the cold air blowing through it."
,,,,,I saw this restaurant on the T-Mobile Park food account on Instagram and had it on my list of places to check out when we visited Seattle. My wife and I stopped to see the Fremont Troll and just happened to drive by it on the way to our Air BnB.
,,,,,"We shared the #1, the Caribbean Roast and it did not disappoint! The meat was tender and moist. 10/10... would eat again."
,,,,,"Yes, this place is ridiculous!  Let me start by saying it is very, very messy.  Not something you would eat in your car."
,,,,,The best selling sandwich is the Caribbean Roast.  A delicious and succulant pork shoulder that is super tender and coated in Paseo Marinade served inside a toasted baguette. 
,,,,,"When biting into this sandwich you will experience many heavenly flavors that included garlic aioli, crisp romaine, cilantro, pickled jalapeños and a heavy amount of salty caramelized onions."
,,,,,"Of course, my first bite of this scrumptious sandwich, a large majority of the meat  fell out, but I scooped it up with a fork! "
,,,,,A great place to stop when you have a few extra minutes.  The lines can move fast depending on the time of day (5-10 minutes or +30 minutes).
,,,,,"Lots of street parking is available at the Fremont location.  Additionally, the Fremont location has some outside seating and maybe 5 or 6 tables inside. "
,,,,,Side note: The only disadvantage to eating inside is that everyone is staring at you while you eat!!
,,,,,"Super friendly service!  Great place to go if you want a special tasting, messy sandwich experience!"
,,,,,"Little hole In the wall spot, family owned. "
,,,,,They are very friendly! I got the 
,,,,,#1 Caribbean Roast
,,,,,"Roasted pulled pork shoulder, aioli, cilantro, romaine, jalapeños, & caramelized onion. "
,,,,,"This sandwich is perfect! Sweet carmalized onions, juicy pork, and some jalapeños for heat. The balance was perfect. A little messy, but I'm sure there is a proper technique.  This place has delicious food!"
,,,,,"We arrived 30mins before closing and you could tell they were ready to shut down. They guy at the register was literally yelling numbers, it became obnoxious. We sat at a table waiting for our food. Once our number was called the guy told us if we wanted to eat there we had 10mins to finish because they were closing up. Otherwise, we would need to sit outside at the picnic tables. They were full so we left."
,,,,,"The portion size was huge. We ordered a roast pork sandwich and a prawn sandwich. We are not impressed. The roast pork was sweet. Living in FL previously, I've had plenty of roast pork. I've had salty but never sweet. There are also very thick onions on the sandwich and lots of them. The ""prawns"" were just really large shrimp. We also ordered the corn, it had the same seasoning on it as the sandwich, it wasn't anything special."
,,,,,"Dear Paseo,"
,,,,,Where have you been all my life?!
,,,,,"Oh that's right, in Seattle. ((grumble))"
,,,,,Why so far? why can't you be in the bay area where I live.
,,,,,"If you want to open a franchise, just call me up. I got you. you can pay me with free sandwiches."
,,,,,"All I got to say is... saw the reviews, went to order, shocked to see how small it was, ordered, ate, and got bitter. Bitter you are so far away and how the only way to get you more was to move to Seattle... hmm..."
,,,,,Caribbean Roast (most popular sandwich) - um. delicious.
,,,,,Paseo Press (basically the one with a lot of stuff in it - um. head explode delicious.
,,,,,so good. i hate you. seattle. psh.
,,,,,until next t... ugh i hate you.
,,,,,franchise?
,,,,,"It is that good, even for vegetarians."
,,,,,The tofu is perfectly seasoned over a bed of rice with a rich tomato sauce and refreshing salad. The side of black beans is more of a soupy mixture that tastes delicious when drizzled over the rest of the food. Even the corn on the cob was worth eating.
,,,,,"Rightly so, the place filled in quickly so plan on getting there during a non-busy hour or taking this to go. Whatever you do, just make sure you get there."
,,,,,"Probably THE best sandwich I've had in Seattle. Hands down. Tender well seasoned pork, perfect amount of heat with the pickled jalapeños, delicious baguette, and caramelized onions. All singing hallelujah in your mouth. If you're craving a sandwich don't waste your time going anywhere else. Come here. Order the Caribbean roast pork sandwich and leave satisfied!"
,,,,,"Opinion: Honestly, thought this was a bit underwhelming. I had the Caribbean pork and rice. Family had the pork, rice and beans and two sandwiches. Mayo sauce for chicken was way too sweet. Definitely sweetened pork that had decent flavor but wasn't out of this world good like I expected. Rice was good and slightly salty. Bread was excellent for sandwiches. In all fairness, I'm not into sweet meat... and I didn't do jalapeños because that isn't the type of heat I enjoy. "
,,,,,Service was fast and friendly.
,,,,,"Other info: a few small tables inside and a few picnic tables outside. They take debit cards it said on their door, and cash. We paid in cash. They have bottled water and canned sodas and tea. They have a water foundation and cups so I wouldn't buy water myself. The location was a bit out of way from main part of Fremont. I would recommend to try for yourself. My parents said 4 stars. My sister said 2 and I said 3. But it gets 4.5 so I'm assuming my sister and I are the weirdos that don't like sweet meat haha"
,,,,,"I first heard about Paseo close to 4 years ago from a friend who visited Seattle frequently. Naturally, I've been wanting to try it ever since. Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't completely blown away, and I probably wouldn't wait for hours to get food here. Nonetheless, the sandwiches are really good so it's still worth a visit, especially for first-timers and tourists."
,,,,,"I ordered the Caribbean Roast, a pork sandwich that comes with the signature grilled onions. The meat was super flavorful, the bread was fantastic, and the grilled onions were unlike any I've had before. I was starting to get full after just a half sandwich, but I continued to eat anyway because it was that darn good. I also tried to friend's Grilled Pork sandwich and that was really tasty as well."
,,,,,There's not much seating room so plan to order takeout. I also suggest coming on less busy days. There was no line for us on a Thursday evening and we were able to get a table right away--score!
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Got the #2 and #8 and split with my girlfriend.
,,,,,BOOM! That was amazing the meat is juicy and is more or less falling apart and the bread was on point. There is a garlic mayo that will rock your world and the carmelized onions are made right. 
,,,,,Personally I liked the #8 better but both were absolutely fantastic. I really liked the pepper on the #2 it added a nice kick to the sandwich.
,,,,,I was so excited to try this sandwich haven upon hearing about it. 
,,,,,"The sandwiches are HUGE. I got the most popular sandwich, pineapple pork. The meat was so tender, and was complimented by delicious caramelized onions and fresh jalapeño and herbs.  The contents inside the sandwich were delicious, all of the flavors meld together in perfect pork harmony..."
,,,,,I could not finish this. It was over $10 which at first I scoffed at... ($10 for a sandwich at a dive joint?) but I was happily put in my place when I received my lunch. This was lunch for a few days!
,,,,,Paseo will give you about 5 wet naps with your sandwich. You will use all 5. This is a WET sandwich. The only problem I had was how wet it really was. It was so hard to eat and the bread got soggy very quickly. Only complaint!
,,,,,"If you are hungry, and I mean really hungry, I would get a sandwich here. Bring your bib!"
,,,,,"Definitely not what I expected. I tried the pork. The sandwich was so greasy, I could not bear to finish and the pork did not taste that dry but I feel it was only because of how greasy the sandwich was. The flavor of it was fine, but the textures and grease was just too much."
,,,,,"If you do want to try it, the place is small and only have a few tables so it definitely a good place to catch a quick lunch with a friend, but not somewhere to have a group. They are really fast as well, and there is street parking which is nice."
,,,,,BEST CUBAN SANDWICH IVE EVER HAD HANDS DOWN. It was so messy to eat but so satisfying. I honestly crave it probably once a week but sadly I don't live in Seattle. Great service too!
,,,,,Love the shrimp sandwich here and a big fan of the roasted corn! I only wish they had more seating!!
,,,,,"Tucked away in the quirky Fremont neighborhood, you may see a long line out the door, but once you order, get ready to taste the best cuban sandwich on the west coast."
,,,,,"The juicy tender pork is so delicious, you may inhale it before you get a chance to snap a picture of it... like me! "
,,,,,Come early as they do run out of popular items and seating is limited. 
,,,,,Beer and wine is available. 
,,,,,Ask for habanero sauce if you love spicy flavors.
,,,,,Came here early in the morning right when they opened. I can't believe there was a line already even before they opened. There is not much searing  area inside or outside. They have 2 seating benches outside but were wet since it was outside. 
,,,,,My bf and I ordered the chicken breast and the Caribbean roast. Both sandwiches were recommended on yelp. We didn't have to wait that long for our food to come out.
,,,,,The sandwiches were super good. The Caribbean roast had sliced roast with a lot of Carmeized onions and a large lettuce. My boyfriend really enjoyed the sandwich. My chicken breast was bomb! I don't know what sauce they use but it was delicious! My sandwich also came with a lettuce and some large Carmelized onions. But I couldn't even eat it like a sandwich. I took 2 bites and the chicken and onions all fell out. I had to eat it with a knife and fork afterwards. The sauce was dripping everywhere!!! 
,,,,,"All in all, the chicken was to die for. I would come back and eat their dripping saucy sandwich. But remember to just do take out because the place isn't that big."
,,,,,"Upon reading some of the reviews before coming here, I thought it was like any other few thousand review place-all hype. But was I ever wrong. "
,,,,,The wait was very long for a Saturday early afternoon but since it just re-opened. I can understand the long line and all the frenzied people wanting to get there hands on a Caribbean roast sando or any of the other delicious sandos. 
,,,,,"I waited for a hour and fifteen minutes total from waiting in line to actually recieving my sando but it was well worth it. The pork was juicey, tender, well flavored and plentiful. Usually, sandos are lacking in the meat department but I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat that was in it. The carmelized onions and even lettuce were a nice compliment. "
,,,,,I would definitely gladly wait in line for another of these sandos or to try another most likely delicious ones from the menu. 
,,,,,Since it re-opened people have mentioned that it's not the same but this version is still pretty good in my book.
,,,,,The sandwich is everything I want from life. I'm vegetarian yet their tofu sandwich with the onions and aioli is what dreams are made of
,,,,,"Hi Rani, "
,,,,,"Thank you so much for your review! We're so glad you enjoyed your tofu sandwich! Our tofu red sauce plato is also a vegetarians dream, and we recommend trying that next since you enjoyed your sandwich! We hope to see you back soon! :)"
,,,,,You know I was really excited to try out this place based on all the reviews raving for the #1 caribbean  sandwich but honestly I thought it was just okay - the pork was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Believe the hype.
,,,,,"Just the smell of them cooking is enough to get your drooling. These people know what they're doing, even their tofu dish is amazing, and the prices are super reasonable. The thing is that there isn't much seating inside, they have benches outside but be prepared to sit next to someone you don't know. Oh and the pulled pork, get that too, so much flavor!"
,,,,,My favorite food spot during my four day Seattle trip! Found this place based on the highest reviews on Yelp in Seattle (thank-you Yelpers) and decided to try the Caribbean sandwich! The sandwich here definitely exceeds my expectation of how great a sandwich can really taste. I tried the most popular item #2: Caribbean Roast. Oh my goodness!! How can a sandwich be so freaking delicious!!! I literally came back to Paseo right before I went to the airport on my last day in Seattle to pick up another sandwich! That's how good it is!
,,,,,"Ok, so Paseo is a tiny local sandwich spot. It is easily spotted when there is a long line out the door. There isn't much seating indoors or outdoors so it's not the best place to hang out in a large group. The sandwiches are charged at a reasonable price roughly around $10 for a decent size sandwich. The flavors of the braised pulled pork inside the Caribbean Roast is unbelievably tasty. It has a tropical fruity flavor kick to it topped with large caramelized grilled onions! The inside of the sandwich is completely soaked with sauce so it gets messy when you eat it. But don't worry, there's a bathroom to wash your hands! Just try this place when you visit Seattle! Trust me, you won't regret it! You may even end up like me and come back within a few days for more! It is just too good to pass!!"
,,,,,"Pretty disappointed on my visit, as I had high hopes for my meal, but I'll fully admit that my disappointment could likely be due more to my meal choice than anything. My local friend told me that I HAD to go to Paseo. I didn't know what it was when she said that, but when I looked it up and saw Caribbean food, I wasn't too excited because I am Caribbean and I grew up on those flavors. The Caribbean is diverse though, and their food can range from West Indian to Hispanic, so I wasn't sure what Paseo was rooted in. Upon entry, I quickly saw it was leaning more towards Hispanic, which was cool because I grew up with more West Indian food. "
,,,,,"I chose my meal too quickly and settled on the Paseo Pork sandwich, which had a title next to it that pretty much promoted it as their signature dish. Furthermore, it was voted ""best sandwich"". If I wasn't rushing. I would've chosen a more balanced meal with rice, meat and a side, which I didn't notice was on the menu till later. So that left me with this ""best sandwich"" which was just way too greasy and left something to be desired in the seasoning of the pork. I've tasted so much better when it comes to pork sandwiches, and with this being Hispanic themed, they could've done more. "
,,,,,"Nonetheless, I do believe there is something to this place, and I'd give it another try by ordering a different dish. Good small business feel to it, and comforting indoor/outdoor setup."
,,,,,"Food is amazing and authentic. Staff is super nice and fast. I always get take out. One thing --when you say spicy, they mean it! So maybe ask for a 3 Star instead of 5. 5 is inedible. Fair warning"
,,,,,They are busy on the weekdays for lunch. This place is amazing. So glad they accept card. Love the outdoor seating in the benches in the shade. This is a fast operation. 
,,,,,I got the Caribbean roast pork and the roasted corn and both are so incredible. 
,,,,,I can't wait to come back soon
,,,,,"One of my favorite meals in Seattle! Came here on a whim after visiting the Fremont Troll & I'm so glad we did! Knew we were in for a treat based on the number of yelp reviews & I agree that it deserves all the praises! My friend & I decided to split the Caribbean Roast & a roasted corn since we had just gone to a cafe prior and was planning on grabbing a dessert afterwards. Frankly, it was a bit messy, but definitely worth it! Sadly, the sandwich itself was lacking a bit of a kick, but I could taste the potential in its flavors and meat juices. The corn was delicious and I'm glad there was a yelp check-in deal for it. The place itself is a bit small, but we were lucky to beat the crowd since we visited at an odd hour before dinner. Overall, I would definitely recommend to friends & family visiting Seattle. Would love to come back in the future!"
,,,,,"As I am not from Seattle, I showed up to this restaurant expecting Caribbean food and boy was I in for a surprise, and not a pleasant one! I ordered the pork but was told there was no sauce to pair along with it, and of course the pork was dry, stringy and had NO seasoning. This was easily the worst meal I've had in Seattle. Not sure why this place is so overhyped but I was bored from start to finish."
,,,,,Such staggering and unbelievable onions! The pork is tremendous! I love these workers like some of my less successful children.
,,,,,A lot of people are saying that you can't have a Caribbean sandwich this immense so far from the Caribbean. That's just what I had heard though and those lowlifes are CLOWNS. I would eat here every day if I could!!
,,,,,"All I can say is amazing!! We stopped here for a famous Cuban sandwich. First off, I suggest ordering more than one sandwich and sharing it with others. "
,,,,,"We ordered the paseo press and Caribbean roast. Both are filled with roasted pork and caramelized onions. Both were amazing!! But if have to say, the paseo press was the best!! It was filled with roast pork, smoked ham, Swiss cheese and banana peppers. We also ordered tortilla chips with spicy salsa on the side. I've never had more delicious salsa in my life!!"
,,,,,I'm sure I'll be back to Seattle soon and I will def return here for some sandwich good-ness!!
,,,,,"I love their Caribbean pork sandwich, which is their most popular sandwich. If I was a local, I would come here at least once a week! By looking at the reviews, my friend and I expected long lines, but if you time it just right, there's no wait. The sandwich is pretty big so we decided to share one. I was pretty full after. I wish I could've ordered a full one and ate the whole thing though... "
,,,,,This place is definitely not overhyped. It deserves all their stars.
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"The sandwiches here are the messiest, but best tasting sandwiches in Seattle! I can definitely see this place as a well known spot to locals. I usually don't go for sandwiches, but this place seemed like a Seattle staple. Their most popular sandwich, the Caribbean Roast, was my favorite compared to the Paseo Press. They were pretty similar though in my opinion. There were large chunks of meat on both and the best part was the caramelized onions. I usually don't like onions very much! The toasted baguettes soaked up the garlic aioli sauce, which made the baguette flavorful and not dry tasting. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches are definitely very messy, so I would recommend eating it at the restaurant or at home. I almost decided to eat it at a park nearby, but thank goodness I did not! Seating is limited inside and there are a few seats outside the restaurant. "
,,,,,"There is street parking, and I noticed there were a few spots close to the restaurant."
,,,,,This place makes me happy that I eat meat again. 
,,,,,Sure its been reviewed more times than pretty much any place in Seattle... so I might not have a lot more to say. Just go. Its tasty and worth it. 
,,,,,Go now!
,,,,,Love this place!
,,,,,Heard about it from different people and it didn't disappoint. 
,,,,,The authentic Caribbean food reminds me of my roots and the flavors that are not always easy to find in the Pacific Northwest.
,,,,,"Prices are very reasonable and service is typically fast, although the place gets packed!"
,,,,,"There is limited seating, so if you are in any kind of rush, take out will be your best bet."
,,,,,The grilled chicken sandwich is my favorite and I would recommend it!
,,,,,"Carribean fare in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, with a mostly Asian clientele."
,,,,,"I can see how this may have been America's best sandwich maybe five years ago but by today's standards it's not all that impressive for being 10.95; roast pork was kind of bland, and the aioli didn't do much but add an extra dimension of grease to it. The caramelized onions were a good touch but would have been a lot better had it been a little warmer. The bread was close to Dutch Crunch in terms of texture on the outside, but soggy inside which kind of ruined it."
,,,,,"The entire sandwich tasted substantially better once I sprayed some sriracha on top -- overall a very enjoyable sandwich, but it just felt like they're phoning it in with this one; I shouldn't have to add sriracha to a sandwich that costs 10.95 to make it more enjoyable."
,,,,,"Great sandwiches. Meat was a bit dry compared to the other time I've had it. We got the Caribbean roast. I love their grilled onions and the jalapeños. Fast, efficient, and delicious food! Parking sucks though, especially since we came during the solstice parade. Would most definitely recommend!"
,,,,,"I came here with a friend because he told me that Paseo had been the #2 Yelp Restaurant in the U.S. back in 2014. I had high expectations, and Paseo did not disappoint. Since we weren't that hungry, we split a $10 Caribbean Roast Sandwich (their most popular sandwich) between us as well as tortilla chips and a 3 oz. cup of black beans. The marinated pork shoulder was very tender and juicy and shined as the star of this hearty sandwich. My half of the sandwich fell apart in the beginning since it was brimming with meat, so I recommend trying to keep the sandwich together in order to get the full combination of great flavors. The chips and black beans served as tasty sides to the sandwich."
,,,,,"While I personally wouldn't crave it ever, there is no denying that Paseo offers some really great sandwiches. I love the hole-in-the-wall vibe you get from this place too!"
,,,,,"I want to give this place a 5 star but I'm sticking with a 4. I ordered the chicken thigh sandwich and it was delicious but I had to pick apart a lot of the meat in the sandwich, because it looked pink eek . My husband said it was seasoning but seeing pink chicken is always a little gross. After I picked it apart though I was satisfied with the sandwich. The aioli, onions jalapeños and romaine are a great mix. I also added the green Yucatán sauce which made it even better! Anywho aside from the color of the meat and having to pick it apart the sandwich, service and atmosphere was good."
,,,,,"LOVE the food here. SO flavorful, big servings, and lots of options. Im vegetarian and it's still one of my fav spots. Whenever I have friends in from out of town, this is one of the spots I take them to."
,,,,,"Usually I can look at a photo of a dish and identify an element that leads me to choose it over another. Not so with these. A photo or a description cannot capture what it is to eat a Paseo sandwich. The aioli, baguette, caramelized onions, jalapeños, and marinated, grilled chicken come together in an indescribable way. The only way to express it is to say that we will spend 2 hours traveling in the car just to eat a Paseo Chicken Breast Sandwich. "
,,,,,"Once upon a time, we lived in the neighborhood of this original Fremont Paseo location, when they had a different owner, only accepted cash, and ran out of bread by the late afternoon. This location still has local charm, but now accepts credit cards and seems to always have enough bread, despite the line that often trails down the block. It's fun to go here, although parking can be rough. Pro tip: Call in your order ahead of time for a quicker pick up."
,,,,,The sandwich is good but not one of my favorites. What I did fall in love with is the N. Fremont area of Seattle. This is a really cool spot.
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Food: 5/5.    Price: 4/5.    Service: 5/5.    Ambience: 3/5
,,,,,"Holy crap the sandwich was legit!! With almost 4500 reviews and 4.5 stars, and rated #2 in the US on Yelp a few years ago, I had to come here and give it a try. Paseo is a hole in the wall shack, but trust me you won't be disappointed. You order by the counter and wait for your number to be called."
,,,,,"#2 Caribbean Roast - pork shoulder coated in Paseo Marinade and slow roasted till falling into succulent morsels. All sandwiches are on a lightly toasted baguette and slathered with aioli, fresh cilantro, pickled jalapeño, lettuce, and caramelized onions. This is their most popular item, and there's a reason for that! First of all, the baguette was toasted perfectly with a nice crunch, though it's a bit small. The sauce - HEAVENLY. Loved the roast pork shoulder, delicious flavors. Some pieces were dry, but the parts with pork fat was amazing. Tons of caramelized onions, making the sandwich to a whole new level. "
,,,,,I would drive the city just for this sandwich. I'll be back every single time I'm in Seattle!!!!
,,,,,Infamous sandwich place in Seattle; was told it's a must try! I ordered #5: Sauteed Prawns as Seattle is known for their fresh seafood. One of the things I enjoyed was how you could customize your spiciness level from 1-5 (I did 3 because I can't really do spicy). 
,,,,,"What was unique about the sandwich: THOSE CARAMELIZED ONIONS were oozing with flavor and the touch of cilantro was great for all those cilantro lovers. I think the unique aspect of this place can be broken down to 3 things; (1) the mayo aioli sauce (2) the crispy fresh bread, (3) the caramelized onions. "
,,,,,"Overall, I would recommend going if you are in the area but if it's super out of the way it's not a ""must-eat"". Sort of reminds me of Seattle's version of Ike's Love and Sandwiches from the Bay Area; super fresh bread and unique tasty sauce."
,,,,,Lived in Seattle for pretty much all my life and cannot believe I just decided to come here.
,,,,,Food didnt take too long and the atmosphere is very fun and chill. It wasnt peak hour when I went so I cant vouch for when it is busy.
,,,,,"The Carribean Roast sandwich is soooo good. The flavors meshed really well, not dry at all with very generous servings of roast pork on it. And the bread was nicely toasted with a good chew to it. I highly recommend it! I'll definitely have to come back for it, I'm missing it already."
,,,,,I also ordered a shrimp sandwhich. While not as mind blowing as the Carribean Roast was still tasty but not memorable.
,,,,,"Also got some fries which had a very addicting seasoning on them. I couldnt pin point what it was, also got the corn. Corn was what I expected it to be, nothing too crazy but still tastes good."
,,,,,"Overall I had a very pleasant first experience with Paseo, and would 10/10 come back."
,,,,,My personal experience was super mediocre:
,,,,,-Beer was on the menu but was not available. 
,,,,,-Their system was down when we arrived and had to wait 15 minutes to put in an order. 
,,,,,-The shrimp sandwich had literally only 5 shrimp inside and tasted like pure habanero (when we only ordered a 2 on the spicy level). 
,,,,,-There are much better Cuban sandwiches to be had and too many other good places in the city to warrant returning here. 
,,,,,..Sorry Paseo. I'm going to Pass..
,,,,,"Like many others have shared, the Paseo Press is awesome!! I added the corn and was really pleased. Yelp said they weren't taking orders online, but one click and I was on the phone with them, placed my order, and picked it up 10-15 minutes later. They're limiting customers inside to one at a time to place orders or pick-up with a separate door for the various delivery services."
,,,,,"Thanks for your review Damon, we’re so glad you enjoyed your meal from Paseo! Hope to feed you again soon!"
,,,,,"I've never had a negative experience at Paseo sandwiches. All the staff, at least the ones I've met, are very friendly and care about the cleanliness of the place. It's always clean in there, both in the kitchen and out where the customers wait. They don't have a lot of seating and sometimes the line can be super long but that's just what happens when you have amazing food. Lunch hour comes around and this place is thriving. I don't care what time it is. When I want paseos, I'll go and stand in line if need be."
,,,,,"As a customer, I pay attention to a number of aspects of any establishment. Unfortunately, Paseo failed on nearly every level."
,,,,,"I was treated disrespectfully by the counter staff. I was given a sandwich which was greasy to put it mildly. I found the napkins reading ""Saving the earth one napkin at a time"" a bit insulting, as I was given maybe 40, of which I had to use a fair number."
,,,,,"I suppose we might say, Congrats Paseo, You've discovered mayonnaise! (but nice try calling it Aioli)"
,,,,,"That said, the sandwich was fairly tasty. But the whole experience was bad, or ""not good"" as the kids are saying these days."
,,,,,"We have a choice of how we spend our money, and what we recommend. And so, Internet, I encourage you to seek out other food establishments. This place has none of the things I'd come back for."
,,,,,"Dear Paseo Caribbean, "
,,,,,"I've heard so much about you, and I'm so glad to have finally met you. Now I know why everyone likes you so much. You are quick and efficient and you waste no time opening peoples eyes to your style of cuisine. As a first timer, the Carribean Plato was my choice of dish, since I didn't feel like eating a sandwich that day. It was sweet, savory, delicious, and generous (definitely shareable between two people.) You were also able to accommodate my vegan friend w/ your Tofu Delight option. Despite the small location, things move quick, and people eat quick. Your customers are also not afraid to eat while standing. I respect that. I can't wait for more of my friends to meet you. =)"
,,,,,"Super disappointed by my last visit.. got the jambalaya plate and it literally looked like someone ate half of it. There were about 4 sausage slices and 2 shrimps with maybe a cup of rice. You've got to be kidding me for $16.... See photo for evidence. To make matters worse, I called in ahead of time for pickup. Ended up waiting at least 30 minutes -- I was there so long I saw some dude back up into an old Porsche and the two men take photos and argue and everything. They literally started making the order when my husband went to pick up the order at the counter. His sandwich was good as expected. Anyways, will stick to Un Bien unless they become no bien as well!!"
,,,,,Legendary Caribbean sandwiches here and always tasty.  I especially like the flavor on the steak sandwich.  This place never disappoints.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,I understand the hype people! It was completely empty on a random Thursday afternoon. The place is incredibly small so it is more of a get your sandwich and go kind of place. There were like 3 tables inside.
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast is apparently the most popular but I was not feeling a pork sandwich. Cashier serving me recommended the Smokin' Thighs. Sandwich came out quickly. More importantly this sandwich was amazing, sweet, and juicy. The caramelized onions plus the aioli balances out really well. It can get quite messy, but you will enjoy it so much you won't even care. Enjoy!"
,,,,,I was in Seattle for only 3 days but made sure I got to eat here at least twice.
,,,,,"The food is absolutely delicious, you can see that it's worth the wait on the weekends and during rush hour. I came during off hours both times so we didn't have to wait at all."
,,,,,"The first time around we ordered a salad with chicken and they completely forgot the protein, but we were so impressed with the sandwiches we came back again regardless of the rude/pretentious worker and salad mishap."
,,,,,"Make sure to take pictures of your food before touching any wrappings, you're hands are going to get messy."
,,,,,Food - 5/5
,,,,,Price - 4/5
,,,,,Service - 2/5
,,,,,Parking - 5/5 (plenty of free residential areas)
,,,,,Paseo press is delicious! Every bit of it is amazing. Here is the rundown: 
,,,,,"bread is fresh, soft and chewy. Does a great job at soaking up the pork sauce, the aioli and cradling the pork, ham, cheese and bed of yummy onions. "
,,,,,"The pork is soft, sweet and literally melts in your mouth. The ham adds a lovely smokiness to the bite as well as the accent of cheese. "
,,,,,"Dont forget to take a big bite with the soft grilled onions and vinegary banana peppers. All in all, with that perfect bite of everythint this sandwich has to offer, its harmony. "
,,,,,"Okay, onwards to the other stuff: "
,,,,,Bathroom is extremely clean.
,,,,,"Limited seating, so you may need to take your order to go. "
,,,,,Quick and friendly service 
,,,,,Clean establishment
,,,,,Yes!!!!!!! This place was recommended by my roommates. It is a $10 sandwich but it made it worth it.
,,,,,Will recommend the carribean roast. It left my palette wanting more. It is a huge sandwich. I do recommend sharing. But if you didn't eat before order for yourself. 
,,,,,I do want to come back to try more options. Will recommend :)
,,,,,"I've heard numerous fantastic things about Paseo - from the moment they closed and the outrage that was sparked across Seattle, causing almost Trump-like riots. To now where they are trundling along as a popular small eatery in a popular neighborhood. So I thought it was high time I check it out with my wife. "
,,,,,"First of all, we were a little shocked to see its shack-like setting! Having been to numerous Caribbean islands, it was more run down than most of the side of the road joints in Jamaica, Barbados etc... "
,,,,,"We headed in, undeterred, and found the menu to be quite full of options which we liked. I went with their staple sandwich as indicated by the menu and we were served 10 or so minutes later. With this place being tiny, we ended up sitting on a bench outside staring at the side of a white van one yard in front of us - so a 1* for scenery. "
,,,,,"I opened the sandwich up and oh my goodness - something was killed and it spewed all of its remains into my sandwich. It was a full, hot, soggy mess. My wife's sandwich was so hot in fact, she couldn't eat it for 5 minutes, literally! Microwaved? And yes - soggy lettuce everywhere, no lettuce should be cooked, average chefs can tell you that. The sandwich was a bite of a disaster - excuse the pun. "
,,,,,"All in all, go check it out for yourself, but don't think of this as Caribbean, we've been all over and this food wouldn't cut it as being good enough there, safe to say."
,,,,,T-H-E  B-O-M-B  is all I got to say! 
,,,,,So much flavor!
,,,,,Parking sucks and the wait can be kind of long but it was worth the walk and wait.
,,,,,"How do you pass up a Cuban Sandwhich spot in Seattle with almost 4000 reviews?  Seriously, Yelp has just made me this spoiled, that I only ate at 2000+ raving review spots while I was in Seattle."
,,,,,"Paseo was another great spot, serving some hearty, hefty, heavy multiple-pounder sandwiches that no doubt, left me satisfied hunger-wise, but probably not satisfied weighing more pounds once I was through.  We had the Paseo Roast and Carribean Press.  These sandwiches are jam packed with juicy hearty pork meat, overflowing with oil and sauce and caramelized onions (lettuce and cheese where applicable) between two bricks of bread.  As much as it's overflowing with ingredients, the flavor also overflows."
,,,,,"The spot presents itself like a little hole in the wall shack, giving it a realistic cuban/carribean streetside sandwich shop feel.  You have to eat this at the shop, and away from the car; you may also need a fork and knife.  It's a monster!"
,,,,,"One of those ""hole in the wall"" places that is mind blowing. The sandwiches are so good. Totally crave-able. It's not overly convenient so I don't get there very often but it never disappoints. Drooling a little as I day dream of this sandwich. Worth the long line!"
,,,,,The Caribbean Roast sandwich was SO GOOD it made me start writing Yelp reviews. Seriously.
,,,,,"The pork roast is dripping in flavorful garlic-citrus flavor, the pickled jalapenos add a welcome bite, and the aioli and caramelized onions on the toasted baguette really completed the package. The lettuce was just hangin' out."
,,,,,"For $9.75, this ended up being the most standout meal I had over two weeks of visiting Seattle."
,,,,,"It's food counter style. I went when late, but there appears to be limited seating."
,,,,,I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH THIS REVIEW WILL BE IN ALL CAPS. 
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Hehe just kidding about the all caps. But in all seriousness, this could possibly be the best thing I've tried in Seattle! If you are visiting, you MUST come to Paseo!!!"
,,,,, 
,,,,,I ordered the classic Caribbean Roast and tried a bit of my friend's Chicken Breast Sandwich. Both sandwiches came out to be $10~ including tax but the Caribbean Roast has a slight winning edge over the Chicken Breast Sandwich with all of its perfectly grilled onions and pickled jalapeno *cry*.
,,,,, 
,,,,,Be prepared to keep the sandwich wrapper spread out on the table while you're eating. If you're a messy eater like me... ingredients will probably fall out of your sandwich.. And trust me when I say you don't want to waste a single piece of your sandwich LOL.
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Small location, so be prepared to eat on the curb or take your food to go. Can't wait until one day I come back to try their bowls/entrees :)"
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"The Cuban sandwiches are fantastic! Great rolls (baguettes) crunchy outside, but not too crunchy. The roasted pork is well seasoned, tender and juicy and combined with the ham, caramelized onions and peppers this is a must try sandwich if you like Cuban sandwiches."
,,,,,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  These sandwiches and lemonade is the best summer treat you could hope for.  The classic Famous Caribbean Roast and the Tofu Delight both made our nights.  And our lunches the next the day, too! So good."
,,,,,"We just booked a catered event for this fall and are excited to be working with Paseo. We already know that we love Paseo's food; however, we were particularly impressed with the time and energy Ryan from the Paseo team spent helping us coordinate our birthday party for about 125 people. Not only did Ryan answer about 30+ questions we had via multiple emails, he did so promptly while also keeping us within our budget."
,,,,,We are excited for our event in a few months and appreciate the time and care Ryan took to coordinate all the details!
,,,,,"Simply put, no trip to Seattle is quite complete without a trip to Paseo because these sandwiches are so freaking delicious!"
,,,,,"For years, Paseo has been a Seattle staple, and its fans are a testament to how good the food is.  Due to legal troubles, the original owners decided to shut down the shop.  So when there was a campaign to get it back open, loyal customers contributed to make sure that Paseo's would continue its good work of satisfying the taste buds of its customers.  And if you come by you will understand exactly why."
,,,,,Here are some of the few things I have had:
,,,,,"Cuban Roast (sandwich): On the menu, they claim it is their most popular sandwich and for good reason!  The pork has been cooked to melt in your mouth tenderness slathered with a nice rich aioli and mixed with pieces of jalapenos that give it a little heat and carmelized onions for sweetness.  This is all sprinkled with pieces of cilantro to give it a nice crispness to it all.  Of course, this is all nestled into a nice baguette that is a sturdy vessel to hold the massive filings and provides a great crunch."
,,,,,"Grilled Chicken Breast (entree): A super filling meal with a nice flavored piece of meat makes this simple meal great!  In addition to the meat, you get a salad, jasmine rice, corn on the cob, and black beans.   I think the only low point of the tray was the corn on the cob but everything else was on point.  The salad must I add is super delicious.  It doesn't have much - greens, onions, beets.  However, with a nice acidic dressing, it is was the perfect accompaniment for the grilled chicken which was moist and had a nice char with a sweet and tangy sauce. "
,,,,,"When you pull up, you would be surprised a place so small is able to cater to its many fans, but the service inside is pretty fast and efficient.  Getting a seat at the restaurant itself is kind of luck of the draw, but they also package the food for you so it is easy for you to take to go.  Especially with several wonderful parks nearby, a picnic with Paseo's is a good option on a good day out in Seattle.  "
,,,,,These sandwiches are filled to the brink so I would highly recommend making sure you grab some toilettes if you decide to take it to go.  There is no dedicated lot for parking but you should be able to find street parking in the general area.
,,,,,"Overall, Paseo has finger licking good sandwiches that are worth visiting when you are in the Fremont area!"
,,,,,"I see that most of the reviews are still quite good, so perhaps my experience is not the norm.  However, I will offer a review based on my experience."
,,,,,"I ordered and paid for the sandwiches online the day before.  On arrival at the scheduled time, the counter staff found no record of the order.  Fortunately I had a copy on my phone to show them.  Although I was pleasant and not argumentative, the counter staff were detached and disinterested, placing the order to be filled, but with no apology or explanation whatsoever, and perhaps a bit of condescending smug indifference. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches (Caribbean Roast) were a major disappointment.  The bread was a completely saturated, falling apart, mayonnaise and moisture sponge--any semblance of a crust long gone.  The meat was a wet pallid gray.   "
,,,,,It appears that Paseo is in need of better consistency and onsite management that cares.
,,,,,I will not be back.
,,,,,"Hi Ted, "
,,,,,"We are very sorry to hear about your experience and would like to deeply apologize. We’re going to speak to staff about this incident and make sure this kind of experience does not happen again to you or any other customer. We would appreciate hearing more about your visit including the date and time, so we can further look into this. We would also love to send you a gift card for a lunch or dinner or us, so we can show you the right Paseo experience. Please email us at "
,,,,,"Thank you for making us aware of this,"

,,,,,Tl;Dr
,,,,,"Amazing sandwiches, super messy. "
,,,,,"The food here is delicious with great flavor in their meat. The meat is super juicy which makes for an amazing, but messy sandwich. "
,,,,,Make sure to use the napkins and hand wipes they give you!
,,,,,"Food was tasty. The chips and salsa were below average. Chips were not homemade, salsa was warm and not too spicy, taste OK. The Caribbean pork was tasty with the grilled onions and sauce, bread was perfect. "
,,,,,"The beans and rice were OK, but could have used some cilantro or pico de Gallo, very plain and nothing too exciting. "
,,,,,"The lady at the register was a little off putting. She first complained ""these people are taking forever."" She didn't know I heard her, but when I apologized, she said, ""Oh no, it's OK, take your time."" She seemed impatient and there was only one family behind us, which I offered for them to go in front of us, but they weren't ready either."
,,,,,"Also when asked about a dish, she said, ""it's on the menu,"" instead of explaining. She then explained, so that's good. It was quick, we just ordered a to go. "
,,,,,The place is super small so I recommend getting to go and maybe even calling in your order. 
,,,,,"Overall the food was good, especially if you are a meat eater. They had some vegetarian options, but they just seemed a bit plain."
,,,,,I was very much looking forward to this place because of the great reviews. And I was soooo underwhelmed. We came in on off hours so we didn't wait much. 
,,,,,We shared an order of the most popular sandwich. The sandwich bread and the lettuce were soggy. The meat was a tad bit dry and more subtle in flavor. It definitely was a bit too sweet for me but has potential. The caramelized onion was really amazing though. 
,,,,,I would pass if you are a tourist like me and only have a few days in Washington.
,,,,,Best Cuban sandwich in Seattle . Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
,,,,,"Ever since watching the movie Chef, I have been in love with the Cubano sandwich. "
,,,,,Paseo without a doubt has the best Cubano I have ever had.
,,,,,"While it was quite the trek getting to by bus from Cap Hill, it is definitely worth the trip. However, you will want to get there early because the line forms quickly."
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"Unfortunately, I don't understand what is hyping this place up. My bf got the most popular sandwich here, the Caribbean roast and I got the Havana seared scallop sandwich. It's a hole in the wall sandwich shop with like 3 tables inside and a couple of large communal tables out front. Not the nicest looking restaurant. Service was quick, but to be honest, it felt like the restaurant was staffed by mostly teenagers. The staff were constantly joking around, and it was kinda uncomfortable eating inside."
,,,,,"Sandwiches were wrapped up, which contains all the moisture. I opened up the wrapper, I and got a soggy sloppy sandwich. It was not that good. Very difficult and messy to eat. Everything fell out of the sandwich as you tried to take a bite into it. Didn't seem like good quality items either for $11 a sandwich. Overall, I guess I'm glad I got to try it, but don't get sucked into these tourist traps like me."
,,,,,MEH. mind you my friends loved this place however i didn't.
,,,,,"first off for parking you'll have to get lucky and find street parking. and once you do make a short walk to this cute little shop with a few tables outside and inside. once you go in its nothing fancy but something more on the authentic side. i went ahead and ordered and asked what the most popular was and of course it was the ""Caribbean Roast"" aka this has pork and was supposed to be delicious. got this to-go so i could go eat with friends at gas works park."
,,,,,they were very friendly and gave great service and were very quick with making my order and making sure it was packed with napkins and everything i needed. so definitely the place had great service and everything!
,,,,,"however, unfortunately when i got to gas works to take a bite of my hyped up sandwich it kinda let me down. at least in my sandwich i didn't taste much flavor and all i had were super big chunks of onion that were super hard to bite down on and just wouldn't really break off so i ended up having to eat huge chunks or onion and/or they fell out. the taste just wasn't there for me. but i would return to maybe try something else since this place is so hyped and beloved to seattle residents and visitors. give it a shot yourself and maybe I'm wrong!"
,,,,,"Paseo's has some good sandwiches, moist and flavorful. "
,,,,,"Their shop is small, with not too many tables inside (3). After ordering to eat there, had to eat outside."
,,,,,"The sandwich itself is pretty messy, and needed to be fully wrapped in paper. Eating it without getting your hands dirty is pretty hard. Bread was properly toasted, mayo light and saucy, meat pretty soft, and jalapenos had a light kick. My only complaint with is was the meat wasn't too tenderized. There were some meat chunks that were just harder to bite into, but not too hard. The best thing about the sandwich though were probably the onions, so sweet and savory. "
,,,,,"Overall, a great sandwich, just get it to go."
,,,,,"Tried #5 Sauteed Prawns which was plain, nothing special. The ratio of onions to sandwich wasn't balanced, too much onions for my liking. The shrimp itself was decent but overwhelmed by the other ingredients. Not sure if this is worth getting here when there are other more popular items. "
,,,,,Also tried #8 Paseo Press which was definitely more flavorful and very enjoyable. It's similar to the popular #2 sandwich but we wanted to try something different. 
,,,,,Overall the sandwiches are a bit messy to eat. Limited seating: there are only about three tables inside but two picnic benches outside.
,,,,,"Seattlelites, please don't come together and send an angry mob to seek revenge on me."
,,,,,"I've had a lot of sandwiches, but unfortunately, Paseo isn't the best sandwich I've ever had. Perhaps it makes the top 10, but I'm not sure if it cracks the top five."
,,,,,"Now, let me explain myself."
,,,,,"It is certainly a good sandwich. If you love caramelized onions, you will looOOOooOOoove Paseo. I think the issue here was that my expectations for this place were through the roof. I think I was expecting these sandwiches would blow my mind - literally."
,,,,,My friend and I decided to get the Grilled Pork and the Caribbean Roast to share. 
,,,,,"The first thing you should know about Paseo is that you should COME HUNGRY. We had nibbled on a little something beforehand, so when it was time to unwrap our sandwiches I was completely OVERWHELMED."
,,,,,"These sandwiches are behemoths. But lovely. And tasty. The Caribbean Roast tends to be the most popular item on the menu, but I personally like the Grilled Pork because the meat was tastier. The Caribbean Roast for me was somewhat dry which, from what I've seen of the Paseo reviews on Yelp, doesn't tend to happen."
,,,,,"At about 11:30 a.m. on a Thursday, I was pleasantly surprised to find that we were not only able to snag a table, but we also didn't have to wait terribly long for the sandwiches."
,,,,,"This is not 99% of the time, especially on a weekend. My advice: Call ahead, get there on-time, take out or eat at a nearby park instead of trying to get a seat inside."
,,,,,"I had the paseo press (which isn't pressed like a Cuban, just an FYI).  Bomb pork, insanely juicy.  Overall the sandwich is super messy (in a good way) and it's on the sweet side."
,,,,,Sleepless in Seattle?? NOT!!
,,,,,First place recommended to stop and eat at..
,,,,,Known for their Caribbean/Cuban Sandwiches.
,,,,,"Luckily it was a Friday early morning lets say 11a and 5 people already standing in line. From reading reviews and posting of people's pictures on social network, this joint gets packed! Small but cozy eatery, and friendly smiling worker bee's. Grabbed a table for 5 and waited for about 15mins and our number was called."
,,,,,What did we all order? pretty much the same thing LOL
,,,,,It's highly recommended to order the Caribbean Roast Sandwich.
,,,,,"Picture: Slowly cooked Pork shoulder coated in Paseo Marinade, on a lightly toasted baguette slathered with aioli (seasoned mayo) , fresh cilantro, pickled jalapeños, crisp romaine lettuce & crowned with caramelized onions. "
,,,,,"All that succulent pork dripping down my face, made every bite worthy!!"
,,,,,Thank you Paseo!!!
,,,,,"I can't believe I have to update Paseos, it was great when I had the sandwich about 15 yrs ago, but today's lunch was a total zero for me.  EVERYTHING has sugar in it, the beans were sweet, the rice was sweet, the salsa was really sweet, nasty little piece of watery corn and for all that it was $22 for take out.  It seems they just took a $7 Mexican meal and just added pineapple juice to everything.  Sorry."
,,,,,Everybody loves Paseo.  It's an old staple of the Fremont neighborhood for Caribbean takeout.  Must try at least once if you're visiting Seattle.
,,,,,"Would it be passé to say I wasn't blown away by Paseo's big 'n messy sandwiches? Oh the Caribbean-inspired meat-bustin' baguettes oozing aioli were $10 tempting tummy stuffers, but the 3 sandwiches I tried weren't especially great 'n tasty. If you are in this area of Seattle and want to get some filling food to go, Paseo is an option."
,,,,,"Parking wasn't much of a hassle on a residential side street. While the restaurant is small, the line is not. There are 4-5 tables in front of the order counter if you are planning to eat at Paseo ... and lucky enough to get a seat. We were especially happy to see four chairs open up just as we made it to the cashier. Our food was ready for pick-up about 10 minutes later."
,,,,,Caribbean Roast Sandwich ($9.75)
,,,,,"Paseo's popular Pork Shoulder wasn't nearly as tender as I'd dreamt and the Aioli totally overwhelmed any distinction from the meat marinade, caramelized Onions, or pickled Jalapeños. (2 stars)"
,,,,,Sauteed Prawns Sandwich ($10.75)
,,,,,Six medium-sized sauteed Black Tiger Prawns were the stars of this sandwich and probably would have been better not being eaten in a Baguette. (3 stars)
,,,,,Chicken Breast Sandwich ($9.75)
,,,,,"Luckily, my wife ignored my advice and got the Grilled Chicken sandwich cause all four of us agreed it was the best thanks to flavorful and succulent chunks of chicken. (4 stars)"
,,,,,Scallops in Red Sauce over Rice ($7.25)
,,,,,Tiny Scallops and a surprisingly tame Tomato sauce over dry long Rice was a trio of sadness. It's clearly not Paseo's specialty and I don't recommend adventuring out side their known favorites on the menu if this is any example. (2 stars)
,,,,,"We had driven about 30 minutes out of our way to try Paseo and knock another bookmark off the list. I'm not sure the sandwiches were worth the time, cost, or line, but I did leave full and in need of a wet nap thanks to some big 'n messy sandwiches."
,,,,,Ok this is epic 10/10 would eat again I can't comprehend how delicious these sandwiches are.
,,,,,"Hi Matt, we're so glad to hear you loved our sandwiches! We're hoping this review was marked one-star as a mistake, and we hope to see you back soon!"
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"First time in Seattle and headed straight to this great spot!  Short menu but not short on taste.  Salads, plates, & hot sandwiches filled with flavorful meat or seafood w/ their special spices and sauce all on a toasted baguette.  We had the famous Caribbean roast pork (#1 on menu), Sautéed Prawns and chicken breast sandwiches...all so tasty & delicious but just a little messy!  The corn on the cob was a little too buttery for my taste. Fries were basic and the tostones bland. I would definitely come back though and try something different or go back to the yummy sandwiches!"
,,,,,"It's a small restaurant so seating is limited and no A/C.  It was pretty warm today so pretty hot inside.  There are a couple of picnic tables outside though.  Line gets long and service is on the slow side so, beware if you're hangry!  Street parking available but hit or miss. Only one bathroom."
,,,,,"Not sure what the hype is all about. Regular sandwiches, the flavor was ok, and the bread was pretty bad and chewy."
,,,,,"Paseo was recommended to us by a friend that had just visited Seattle, and we sure were very happy to take him up on his advice!! The word is that Paseo was started by a family that got in trouble with some employee pay/holiday issue, and that they sold the business."
,,,,,"Well the new owners must have bought the great recipes to go with the business because the Caribbean sandwich was heavenly, and we ordered a scallop dish over savory rice that really hit the spot! The prices are so good (compared to SF Bay Area prices) that ordering this delicious food made it taste even better!! I wish we had more time in Seattle to come by and order different sandwiches, but we will definitely stop by on our next visit to provide an update to this review."
,,,,,"* the original owners opened up a new location under a different name in Seattle if anyone is interested to stopping by there to compare (diehard fans say its better), google it(or whatever search engine you prefer :p)*"
,,,,,"Delicious food, and tons of it. "
,,,,,"You'll get your hands greasy and you'll enjoy it. The famous Caribbean pork sandwich was the best part, but their corn was a close second. Highly recommend both. The chicken thigh sandwich was harder to eat, but still tasty. Both my friend and I had trouble keeping it together as we ate it. I am docking one star because I thought their shrimp sandwich could've been better. It felt very skimpy compared to the meat sandwiches, and the bread felt like it could be improved, since the crust contributed to some of the structural integrity problems."
,,,,,"Small sandwich shop that is slightly isolated! Can find street parking spots scattered in front and across the street! Get in, order, eat fast and get out!!! Would definitely come back to try their other delicious foods!! "
,,,,,Caribbean Roast: delicious! Full of huge caramel iced onions that add in that sweetness to the tender pork that has the textured of stringy and pulled. Love the banana peppers that add a zesty aftertaste and a tangy taste to the sandwich!! 
,,,,,"Paseo Press: also delicious! Second popular sandwich to the first most popular Caribbean roast!!!! Cleaner to eat and not as ""wet"" as the first! Haha :) ! "
,,,,,Pros: 
,,,,,-delicious delicious sandwiches!! 
,,,,,-good service! Friendly!! 
,,,,,-bus tub for dirty dishes to be cleaned!!! Clean up after yourself for the next customer! You know you would want the same done for you!! :) 
,,,,,-free self serve water and cups! 
,,,,,-their chinaware includes plastic Chinese decorated plates. Thought that was amusing! Didn't see sirarcha haha 
,,,,,Cons: 
,,,,,"-small and cramped! Just 4 sets of tables but thankfully, people eat fast and make way for other waiting people "
,,,,,-so hard to eat in one bite for people with tiny mouths and jaws like mine! Ugh!
,,,,,Quality sandwiches are still good when there is a new staff.  Paseo is an icon and full of goodness.  You will love the bread and everything in between.  Make great choices.
,,,,,Paseo was on my list of go to eateries while I was in Seattle. Upon arriving I quickly noticed that the establishment was not very clean. The two girls working behind the counter seemed like they were just chatting.
,,,,,"Since it was my first and maybe only time visiting I asked them what they were known for and quickly ordered what they recommended, which was the Caribbean Roast. My girlfriend ordered the Pork West Caribbean Bowl. "
,,,,,There was a table open so we decided to take a seat and realized that the tables weren't being tended to so I grabbed a few napkins and wiped the table down myself. While wiping the table down it came to my attention that there were pieces of food within the crevasses of the floor.
,,,,,"Within a few minutes our number was called and we started to eat our food. I took a few bites and just thought my sandwich was ok, nothing great, just ok...would I come back? Probably not. I would probably visit other eateries since I am not from the area. I can say though...that I have been...and just quite frankly was not WOWed."
,,,,,"This place is so fire that as soon as you bite your almost required to have the following sentence come out of your mouth ...""Bruh"""
,,,,,"Seriously so good. I have a craving for the Caribbean roast frequently, and nothing else beats it!"
,,,,,One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The Caribbean roast and pork sandwich was full of mouthwatering flavors. It was also HUGE and stuffed with meat and veggies. 
,,,,,Highly recommend! Two thumbs up!
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"Paseo is famous for their Carribean Roast Pork and their Paseo Press.  I had their Carribean Roast Pork Sandwich, which has an nice crusty bread with a soft center.  The pork with slightly dry, but had decent flavor.  The sandwich tends to slip all over the place.  I would say it's one of those things I'd try but not go back for. "
,,,,,"The story behind this place was it closed for a while-- reopened and was bad, then closed, and then re-opened? Supposedly Un Bien is supposed to be better, but I found them almost the same.  Un Bien had slightly juicier meat but harder (cut your mouth) type bread, though it stayed together better."
,,,,,"When I asked friends where I should visit when in Seattle, everyone pointed me to Paseo. Since my travel friend and I just finished up at the Fremont Sunday Market, we walked our way to Paseo for lunch. "
,,,,,"Upon looking at the menu, the most popular item was the Caribbean Roast - Pork shoulder coated in Paseo Marinade & slow roasted 'til falling into succulent morsels. My friend and I decided to split the sandwich and a side salad. Good thing we did!"
,,,,,"All sandwiches are on a lightly toasted baguette slathered with aioli (seasoned mayo), fresh cilantro, pickled jalapeños, crisp romaine lettuce & crowned with caramelized onions. The sammy was massive and perfectly portioned for two, while the salad we ordered helped balance out the heaviness of the pulled pork."
,,,,,"The best part were the caramelized onions though. For real! The slices were thick and large, but oh so tender and sweet. The pork shoulder was amazing and can be enjoyed as is. They were indeed succulent morsels as the menu describes!"
,,,,,"This is literally one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life!! You need to check out their famous Caribbean Roast Sandwich. On the menu, it says that it was voted the best sandwich and it is not a lie. The sandwich is very flavourful and the roast was juicy and cooked to perfection! "
,,,,,I haven't tried any of their other sandwiches yet cause I fell in love with the first one I tried. I know they also have a lot of different options so I should probably try a new sandwich. I will give this review updates once I try their different sandwiches.
,,,,,"Wow! Visiting Seattle for a couple days. I'm a big foodie so I had to watch an episode of none other than, Anthony Bourdain in Seattle! Luckily this place was a 10 minute walk from my hostel."
,,,,,"Got there and there was about a 5-10 minute wait, really good seeing that this is a hot spot! I ordered the Caribbean Roast, this is their most popular one."
,,,,,"Extremely great sandwich that WILL fall apart, so make sure you have napkins!!. Sandwich was really good, the onions were perfectly caramelized and the meat was tender, could have been a bit more juicier but that's just me. "
,,,,,"All in all, great price, great food!"
,,,,,"Paseo has amazing food. We ordered two sandwiches and an order of fries and the world shook underneath our plates. Their Caribbean sandwich and the thigh pork sandwich were amazing. Since Coronavirus has doomed so many businesses this one was such bliss to find on a Friday evening. The portions are big. I'm a light eater but my partner loved and finished his in one shot. This is a few blocks away from Fremont downtown so why you have to scout is for street parking. I'm sure once the virus has disappeared, business will be as usual and this place will be bustling. Hoping to have more sandwiches.. bon-appetite"
,,,,,First time eating here and I'm definitely going back. The chicken in my meal has so much flavor and so juicy I couldn't believe how good it was. 
,,,,,Definitely going back.
,,,,,"I'm so conflicted giving Paseo's a three star rating. I'm not from Seattle, but I've had Paseo's on two different occasions. On both occasions, I've gotten the popular Caribbean Roast which is a pulled pork sandwich with a mayo slathered soft, crusty roll, jalapeños, lettuce, cilantro, and fat n' juicy onions. "
,,,,,"The first time, I was floored. The pork was succulent with the perfect amount of fatty distribution. The sandwich was soaked and dripping in delicious pork juices. The bread is well-structured and can hold the weight of the contents. I shared with a friend (it was a food trip) and I was light-weight regretful that I didn't just get my own sandwich."
,,,,,"The second time, I was really disappointed. I had convinced myself that this was going to be an amazing meal from my first experience. And you know? Everything was just as good, except for what should really matter, the pork. It was so dry, so stringy. The way that immediately gets stuck in your teeth in an unpleasant way. The sandwich was still moist, but it was from the onions and the mayo, not the pork. Again, I shared the sandwich, but I was glad I did and I didn't even finish my half of the sandwich."
,,,,,"On my second trip to Seattle, I had chosen to go to Paseo's again instead of trying out Un Bien and I was sadly let down. Paseo's is a must-try, but I don't know if they're consistently good. I still would recommend, but next time I'm in Seattle, I will probably make a point to go to Un Bien instead."
,,,,,"I got the #1 (""voted the best sandwich in N America"") and despite the crowd in the restaurant, got the sandwich pretty darn quick."
,,,,,"Really juicy, tasty sandwiches (be sure to use their habernero sauces - it adds a nice tangy touch).  Reasonable prices.  "
,,,,,"The only downside (and I am not really sure it IS a downside) is that it really, really gets all over your face & hands - and the bathroom was closed."
,,,,,Disappointed. The sandwich was so greasy it made the wrapping paper transparent and softened the bread to a point it can't hold the sandwich together.
,,,,,"I had high expectations from this place, as many people talks highly of it."
,,,,,Delicious food. The Caribbean Roast sandwich and Plato are always good. My fiancé also loves their prawn sandwich. We always order for pick-up as this plate is typically busy and pretty limited seating. Good spot for a bite in the Fremont area.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Tip: Paseo is no longer cash only. They take credit cards now! 
,,,,,"After the numerous and highly rated Yelp reviews, Paseo Caribbean Food was a must-eat during my trip to Seattle. I listened to what Yelpers suggested and got the Paseo Press and Caribbean Roast. Of the 2 sandwiches, the Caribbean Roast was the clear winner. The pork was really moist and the sandwich was really flavorful. The Paseo Press was good, but definitely on the drier side of sandwiches. "
,,,,,"These sandwiches are really messy and fall apart very easily. I think the best way to eat then is with a fork & knife that way you can grab a little of everything into 1 forkful without getting the sandwich all over your hands. If all else fails, you can just be messy and clean up afterwards with napkins and Lysol wipes provided."
,,,,,"So, I'm sure you've read the reviews but here's my thoughts of this establishment. I've been here a handful of times and I gotta say first time I was impressed at how good the sandwich is for the price. The food is really great as it's known for their Cuban Sandwich which was popularized by the Food Network. I've tried other items they are well worth the shot to give it a try. "
,,,,,The only thing I can say is that it's a small place and dine in seating is a challenge depending on the time of day. The line to order is also long and out the door and down the street if you come during lunch. This time I came it was slower and with the new owner it seems to move a lot faster. They take credit cards now and seemed like they have more workers. 
,,,,,I'm glad they are back in business as when I visit Seattle I have to make a stop here for a  sandwich. Keep up the good work Paseo's and try not to increase the prices too much.
,,,,,Small right off the street shop. When ordering food  Togo it's ready in minutes. Recommend try #1 on the menu. The sandwiches are hard to beat but can be very messy.
,,,,,"So did the other paseos close for good? Thank goodness atleast one more exists in this world. I use to eat these amazing Caribbean sandwiches while I lived in this city so when my friend and I were each flying from diff cities and meeting in the middle of the country she asked what I wanted from Seattle? Well, a paseos sandwich of course! Among a few other things, it is what I miss the most. "
,,,,,"So I was expecting a bit of a soggy sandwich to arrive by plane and I was going to be just fine with that. However, what arrived was a fully deconstructed Caribbean pork sandwich with  separate containers for the perfectly seasoned pork, out of this world grilled onions, secret sauce that could possibly hold the answers to life's age old questions, baguettes, lettuce, cilantro and jalapenos. And a lot of it all!!  So guess what I had for breakfast, lunch and dinner for 4 days? Yup, I think I MIGHT have gotten my fill that week. So hats off to the guys and gals working at this paseos for not only making the best sandwiches in this country but also for being the best at shipping them across the country. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  "
,,,,,"Oh and guess what my friend wanted from Chicago? Well, Garrett's popcorn, that's what. Seattle, I'll swap you 3 Garretts for one Paseos. Deal?"
,,,,,So disappointed! But that's what I get for cheating on the real Paseo. This one does not even come close. The original owners are now over at Un Bien. 
,,,,,"We lived in Ballard for years and were fairly frequent patrons of Un Bien. We now live on Westlake and the Fremont Paseo is much closer, so we thought we'd give that a try. Big mistake. I'll never cheat on Un Bien again! Even if it is further away for me now. "
,,,,," The Press was an attempt at the original, but falls short. They went way too light on the aioli, and the aioli that was on there was lacking in flavor. Meat was decent. Caramelized onions were good. But the thick slice of cheese was hardly melted. "
,,,,,The corn on the cob was an absolute joke. 
,,,,,Their steak sandwich doesn't even compare to the one at Un Bien. 
,,,,,"Not to mention the wait time. There was no line to get the order in, but it took way too long to get food and seemed like our order was skipped over several times. (Not a large one - 2 sandwiches and corn)"
,,,,,"In the time we waited, I probably could have driven to Un Bien, ordered there, got my food, and driven back. "
,,,,,One extra star because they put a couple wet wipes in the to-go bag. That was nice. 
,,,,,"But, I'm sticking with Un Bien."
,,,,,"Tasty, messy sandwiches at a reasonable price, Paseo is an easy Seattle favorite. It's a little bit hole-in-the-wall with very few tables inside and and an older more worn-down look, but don't let that scare you away."
,,,,,"I tried the Caribbean roast, scallop sandwich, and the Paseo press. Everyone raves about the Caribbean roast but while I thought it was pretty good, for some reason it just wasn't very hot and the meat was a bit dry. The scallop sandwich was another solid choice and very tasty. The Paseo press was the BEST one hands-down though. I would come back for that one alone."
,,,,,"The wait was a 1 star but changed my mind after I ate the Carribean and tasted the Press.  They were delicious and my son loved the cod sandwich.  Although line didn't move for 20 minutes bc lady took 2 phone orders to 1 live order, talked story much longer to customers and was just completely oblivious to the line that doubled, then tripled, while her cooks were waiting for orders.  She was a sweet lady but u have to give me my sandwich! It was sitting there for 15 minutes while you talk story to a customer about the Carribean. You made 1 customer feel special while 18 others in line were just fuming and leaving. BUT, after 1 bite, it was surprisingly worth my shorter wait.  I also had the fries and the roasted corn.  Both good but maybe not worth the $5 price bc fries very small.  Beware: corn and sandwiches are super messy so get lots of napkins and wipes too."
,,,,,"Was 3rd in line but took 20min to order and cooks waiting for orders to come in. Counter lady friendly but made errors so had to fix, then took 2 phone orders bc phone ringing and only took 1 order in line.  Meanwhile, the line grew out the door and now 17 deep.  Hope the food tastes good and is worth it!"
,,,,,Good cuban sandwich but the carmelized onions are not as good as the original owners.
,,,,,Price is too high but still a good sandwich.
,,,,,Paseo Caribbean Food is really delicious! If you like a good sandwich with a lot of flavor than this is a really great spot! I got their most popular/suggested sandwich and really enjoyed it!
,,,,,"It feels like one of those restaurants where all ""the locals"" know about and go. Also, I really enjoy the color of the interior of the building, it's a cool looking restaurant! I suggest everyone to go try!"
,,,,,"Honestly, this place is okay. There was limited seating and it wasn't very clean there.  It also a bit overhyped. My husband and I both ordered a sandwich. He got the Caribbean roast and I got the prawn sandwich. The Caribbean roast, which is their most popular sandwich, was decent but it was very greasy and not as appetizing. I actually preferred the shrimp sandwich but it was a bit on the drier side. Maybe they were both just a bad sandwich but I never came back during my 3 month stay in Seattle. I really did want to like this place but I don't see myself craving for more."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"Love this spot! I've only gone to the Sodo location but the sandwiches, corn, fries sauces everything I've eaten has been so damn good!"
,,,,,I've been dying to come here because of the amazing reviews and because my friends kept raving about it. I've been in Seattle a few times and finally on my most recent trip I was able to make it out here. The restaurant is pretty small - majority of the people grab and go but if you do want to eat there they have a few tables inside and some communal picnic tables outside which is where we ate.
,,,,,"Grilled Pork - Cubed pork loin grilled over lava rocks & basted w/ Paseo Marinade until golden brown: This was the most highlighted item by Yelp so we got one. The pork loin was not ""cubed"" as described. The loin was kept whole inside the sandwich which I actually enjoyed. The Paseo Marinade was an explosion of flavors. I loved the grilled onions and jalapeños that came with it."
,,,,,"Caribbean Roast - Pork shoulder coated in Paseo Marinade & slow roasted 'til falling into succulent morsels: This was even better IMO than the grilled pork. The pork looked like pulled pork sandwich and it was super tender and flavorful. Again, the grilled onions and jalapeños were amazing."
,,,,,There is not a clean way to eat this sandwich. Get lots of napkins and wet wipes because you will need it!
,,,,,"With 4,600+ reviews, do I really need to confirm the hype of Paseo's? (Yes, yes I do.) "
,,,,,"We ordered the caribbean roast sandwich and the plate version of that to share between 3 people. Needless to say, it was enough. The sandwich is a bit small to split between two people, though. While the rice plate had more, it wasn't as delicious as eating pulled pork between toasted bread. "
,,,,,"Seating's incredibly limited depending on your luck, but the communal benches outside have a fast turnover."
,,,,,This place is take out only during covid but it is 100% worth going to. Hands down one of the best sandwiches in town.
,,,,,Food: 5 stars
,,,,,Service: 5 stars
,,,,,"The West Caribbean Bowl was amazing! The chicken was falling off the bone! I loved it. My friends also got the West Caribbean Roast sandwich and they loved it too. Overall, we had an amazing meal."
,,,,,Best sandwich place in the city!!! Anytime I'm near one of these shops I grab one or two since I live in auburn wa.
,,,,,"Holy moly. Delicious would be an understatement to describe the sandwiches at Paseo. This spot is at the top of my list every time I visit Seattle, and I think I've successfully gone every single time I'm in the city ever since being introduced to these sandwiches. This shop is a small and not the most convenient to get to but they're super quick. There are a few seats inside the shop and a communal table outside, which is great in the summertime. "
,,,,,"Their classic is the Caribbean Roast, which is juicy and so flavourful. My favourite is their Steak and Cheese. Most of their sandwiches include their iconic caramelized onions making the sandwiches moist and sweet. Honestly such an amazing stop for lunch, don't miss out on Paseo!"
,,,,,This place is well worth the hype. We were the first customers in today and it was busy within the time we were there. I had the sautéed prawns sandwich and it was amazing. The shrimp tasted really fresh and every part of the sandwich tasted amazing. I'm not sure what kind of bread they use here but it was great! It has a slight sweet flavor so it really goes with everything else. My brothers had the Caribbean bowl and grilled chicken sandwich and both of them really enjoyed their meals as well. Also all of the food is very filling. I really had to power through to finish off my sandwich! 
,,,,,Service was pretty good as well! Our food came out within ten minutes. However there is no parking lot so you have to find street parking and there's limited seating inside as well.
,,,,,"Honestly, there's really only one sandwich to get here. The Cuban pork sandwich AKA the Caribbean Roast."
,,,,,"When you get it, EAT IT FAST: it's best when it's fresh, otherwise, you will end up with a big, wet, sloppy mess of a sandwich. It'll still be good, don't get me wrong, but it will be soggy... and will probably fall apart (this was my only gripe)."
,,,,,Stars: 3.5
,,,,,I'm all about trying out places hyped up like this. 4.5 stars and ~4000 reviews? I had to try it!
,,,,,We came on a somewhat rainy Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Thankfully there was no line at all! The little shop was packed but we were able to snag some seats as soon as someone left. 
,,,,,"Of course my boyfriend and I both ordered the most popular sandwich, Caribbean Roast: juicy tender pork, thickly cut caramelized onions, some greens, and jalapenos smacked in between baguette rolls. It was good but not to-die-for kind of good (perhaps my expectations were just way too high). Try to avoid taking it to-go because the rolls will get soggy real quickly. It's an extremely messy sandwich. My boyfriend was getting super frustrated because everything was falling out of his sandwich as he bit into it. Judging on how big the sandwich looks, I thought I would only be able to eat half, but I was able to finish the whole thing (save a few bites of the bread). "
,,,,,"Afterwards, when we got back to our hotel, [stop reading for those faint of heart] we both took some gnarly ass dumps... If I had had to wait 40+ minutes for this sandwich, I would not have been very happy. But since we didn't... it was a tasty sandwich and I have no regrets :)"
,,,,,"EDIT: Two people have brought to my attention that Paseo has new owners and new recipes. So if you're looking for the old Paseo, go to Un Bien!"

,,,,,We love Paseo. Grilled shrimp sandwich makes my dreams come true. I don't eat pork but I hear their pulled pork sandwich is amazing.
,,,,,"I was finally able to come back recently to check them out since re-opening.  Came by on a weeknight, wasn't busy at all and no line...thank god!  "
,,,,,"Ordered my favorite, the Paseo Press. To me, it mostly taste the same, nothing surprised me on it being different or better.  Same as before, a huge honker of a sandwich, but for $11.50 it better be a monster!  Tasty roasted shredded pork, good amount of sliced ham, cheese, yummy banana peppers and of course the wonderful caramelized onions. Those onions are pretty friggin' awesome!  Sandwich is so big that after one bite, the sandwich will most likely fall apart. Not necessarily the bread got soggy, but it's so stuffed with meat that the sheer power of it just blew it up. I ended up eating most of it off the plate. Messy but it's tasty! "
,,,,,"My buddy got the Caribbean Roast, he enjoyed that very much and thought it was equally as good as well.  No other comments from him as he was busy stuffing his face."
,,,,,"Glad I came back to check them out, staff was friendly and helpful and pretty quick on cranking out the food.  Definitely a Seattle staple to check out!"
,,,,,Great authentic carribean food. Parking can be hard in such a small neighborhood. Limited seating but you can't beat the amazing flavors.
,,,,,First time visiting Paseo in Fremont. I ordered the West Caribbean bowl and it tastes amazing. The flavor is spot on and the meat is juicy and tender. It also comes with a side of chips. I will definitely be coming back!
,,,,,We were recommended this place and stopped on our way traveling north and definitely were not disappointed. we ordered the Caribbean roast and the chicken breast sandwiches and split between the two of us The Caribbean roast is one  of the best sandwiches I've ever had
,,,,,I highly recommend!
,,,,,"OH. EM. GEE. This place blew my mind! You know that feeling you get when you go to a restaurant, and after you eat there, you still crave it? Even though you're stuffed? I haven't felt that way towards a new restaurant in a while. But Paseo last night made me get that hankering feeling. Like, I already want to go back and try their other sandwiches!"
,,,,,"We went last night around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday, so there was no line, and finding a place to sit inside was not a problem. Small space though, they can probably seat 10 people inside? It's like a taco stand but with Cuban sandwiches and plates lol. "
,,,,,My best friend and I shared 2 sandwiches:
,,,,,- #8 Paseo Press $11.50
,,,,,- #11 Havana Seared Scallops $11.50
,,,,,"Finger licking good you guys! The caramelized onions were so good on the sandwiches, just everything about them was amazing haha. Slightly on the greasy side though, the wax paper it was served in were already soaked through before we even pulled them out of the bag!"
,,,,,"I dont know what they put in their aioli, but it almost singlehandedly makes the paseo press and fries incredible. The rest of the sandwich was good as well but not exceptional: bread had small areas where it was tough. The meat was good and the grilled onions and banana peppers added some nice flavors, but the aioli held everything together, being surprisingly sweet and savory. Maybe I'm just starstruck by how great a sweet aioli adds to a sandwich since I havent had it before, but I highly recommend the paseo press (ask for some extra aioli and try it as well)."
,,,,,"It's a good spot for some tasty sandwiches. That being said, it's nothing extraordinary like reviews may say. We had the ""famous"" pork sandwich and the shrimp. The shrimp one was yummy. In my opinion worth getting more than their so called ""rated or voted best sandwich"" pork sandwich which was average. I.e. I could probably replicate it without trying too hard. The bread-kinda tough. The pork-kinda bland. "
,,,,,"If I was craving a sandwich of similar nature I'd go to Valhalla. Oh, and to give you an idea of what sandwich spot I give 5 stars to-if you're ever in the Bay Area CA, check Ike's Place and Little Lucca's."
,,,,,Had the roasted corn deal. Nothing bad to say: flavorful and and tasty. Crisp texture. Good amount of cream though so it gets messy. Some might not like it but love the generous cilantro. Could probably be a bit spicier? I love anything like elote nonetheless though. 
,,,,,Their signature Carribean Roast sandwich is very filling. Probably worth the price in terms of amount. The onions have so soft and grilled very well (were quite sweet!). Oily though so can get very messy. The bun could probably be a bit softer to match the filling (it gets annoying to have trouble biting through completely). 
,,,,,Wouldn't mind coming back here again. Parking can be annoying though.
,,,,,"The BEST sandwich I have ever had in my life. I usually do not eat sandwich very often cuz it is  not my fav dish. But a lot of my Friends recommended this place, so I tried. I ordered their  #1 (pork shoulder) sandwich and grilled pork one. Oh my gosh... literally the best. I will come back to Seattle just for this sandwich. I do not understand some people here on yelp complaining about it is hard to eat just  because it has lots of meat and contents. You should be thankful for every piece of meat and caramalized onions in sandwich unless you are vegetarian. Very flavorful and bread is soft. It is not hard.!Try this place. You will not regret. The only bad thing here is that they do not have a lot of seats here. So keep that in mind."

,,,,,Cool place w/ great food. Right in the Fremont area with cool views and walkability. I ordered the Famius Caribbean roast.
,,,,,"Delicious sandwiches. This is a go to spot for a random evening take out, and always a visit when friends are visiting Seattle."
,,,,,"So glad they are still open during COVID! Stopped here for lunch based off a recommendation. I got the bowl with pork and my husband got the ""best sandwich ever"". The food was amazing and the options were generous. The service was quick and friendly. They are only doing takeout right now."
,,,,,"Too late for me, but several Yelpers informed me this place is under new management."
,,,,,They've lost the recipes. 
,,,,,"The pork shoulder on the Caribbean Roast was poorly executed. It was chalky, clearly overcooked. The bread, sauce, and sauteed onions were all quite good. But loading up a sandwich with overcooked meat is a fast track to Yelp purgatory. "
,,,,,"Please drop your cooking temp and more closely monitor the pork. It's okay to remove some of the fat from the shoulder, but they've removed all of it. With it went the flavor. "
,,,,,"I've been told you should go to Un Bien down the road if you want the original Paseo experience. Hopefully you won't make the same mistake I made (twice, because I also went to the impostor SODO location as well)."
,,,,,"I read the reviews. I knew I had to have the #1 Famous Caribbean Roast Sandwich. I came here on a Tuesday at around 12:30PM, so I was prepared for a crazy wait, but luckily it wasn't that bad at all."
,,,,,"The parking is non-existent! If you're like me, you'll have to park a few blocks away and make the journey over on foot. The seating is extremely limited, and even if you're lucky enough to have a table, you'll be cramped. But, that was the bad, now the good:"
,,,,,"The sandwich I ordered was truly amazing and flavorful! They give a generous amount of meat, and the sandwich itself was a good portion. My fiancée ordered the Caribbean Plate, and that was amazing as well. They packed that container full of food. I even had to step in to help her finish!"
,,,,,"If I'm ever back, I'll certainly be visiting this place again!"
,,,,,"So good! Even though Paseo has become so well known, it still retains that down to earth good taste with a hole in the wall vibe. I came here with two of my friends for an early dinner. I ordered the Red Sauce Plato with cod, and my friends got the Caribbean Plato with roasted pork."
,,,,,The Place:
,,,,,"Yes it is small, but it adds character. Seating can be limited, especially around peak hours. There are picnic tables outside along the sidewalk and the weather was perfect, so we were able to get seats outside. "
,,,,,The Service:
,,,,,"So fast! It took about 5 minutes for my order to be ready, and everyone behind the counter were nice and in a good mood. "
,,,,,The Food:
,,,,,"Red Sauce Plato w Cod - I ordered a the plato at a number 3 heat. All their seafood dishes are cooked with some sort of habanero mix that you can adjust spice level. Portion size was huge! So much food and very satisfying. The cod was topped with the red sauce over a bed of loose white jasmine rice, coupled with greens, corn on the cob and a bowl of black beans. The greens were very good - the vinaigrette and rhubarb mix helped cut through the richness of the rest of the plate. Overall very good!"
,,,,,"This (literally) hole in the wall place in the heart of a Seattle neighborhood is a gem!!! I had their #1 pork sandwich with the roasted corn on the cob on the side. The corn on the cob was THE BEST COB OF CORN IVE EVER HAD!!! Next time I am in Seattle, this may be my first stop. Sandwich was awesome too. Great service and cool atmosphere."
,,,,,"Hi Josh, thank you so much for your review! We are so glad you enjoyed your visit to Paseo and hope to see you next time you visit Seattle!"
,,,,,It's been a few years since I've been back. Still the same goodness flavors. 
,,,,,For first timers:
,,,,,1) go with #1 the carriberean
,,,,,2) #2 the Cuban press 
,,,,,Skip the tostanes. Not worth it. 
,,,,,3) get the grilled corn. 
,,,,,"4) and yes - go with the jambalaya (sausage, scallops, prawns). "
,,,,,You should be good.
,,,,,"The caramalized onions, tostones, tofu plate are all good"
,,,,,I'm from out of town so I was surprised to find out that the 4.5 star rating did not match the actual quality and taste of the sandwiches. I was really disappointed because I had such I hopes for this place and I hate to give Paseo only two stars because the people working there are very friendly. 
,,,,,"To keep it short: We ordered the #1-Caribbean Roast and #2 Paseo Press. Despite the texture of the meat being tender, it was bland and lacked dimension in flavor. I was hoping that the garlic aioli would make up for the blandness but it also lacked in the flavor department. It made the sandwiches rather oily and the sandwiches (specially the #1) fell apart so easily. "
,,,,,I didn't try any other sandwiches or items on their menu so maybe it was the two items I ordered that weren't too tasty.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"This small hole in the wall is a great find! The food is definitely on point. I've never had Caribbean food before, but this place did not disappoint! It's definitely not ideal to sit-down and eat here since here is no AC, no ventilation (other than open window + open door), single bathroom, and very limited seating. However, I did stay and eat :) "
,,,,,"The portions are a lot bigger than I had expected so be careful! My friend and I got their Famous Caribbean Roast, West Caribbean Bowl, and thei famous roasted corn (elote). I know right, lots of food for two girls... Haha, but no regrets! The bowl especially was really big -- could not finish that. After eating till we were full, we still had half of the sandwich and half of the bowl leftover. If we were to go back, I would definitely get the sandwich again! The bowl, good to try, but not necessary for me. "
,,,,,"Nevertheless, I was visiting Seattle and made it point to visit here. I'm glad I did!"
,,,,,"Got take out, the classic roast pork sandwich. It was excellent! Decent portions for price as well"
,,,,,Paseo is a must for anyone visiting Seattle! It's slightly out of the way considering a majority of the touristy areas are located around Pike Place and The City Center. Paseo was our last stop of a non-stop eating tour of Seattle for that day. We went to a total of 6 places in about 3 hours so we were pretty full by the time we arrived at Paseo. 
,,,,,CASH ONLY! 
,,,,,"Luckily, the line wasn't too long. There was only a few people in line in front of us. We looked at the menu prior to coming here and were set on getting the Caribbean Roast since that seems to be the best and top selling sandwich here. "
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast is a pork shoulder marinated in their secret Paseo marinade, topped with aioli, cilantro, pickled jalapeños, romaine lettuce, and caramelized onions. The meat was fall apart tender and the whole sandwich had so much going on. The flavor smacks you right in the face and you get so many different textures and seasonings. The caramelized onions and aioli stood out the most from the list of toppings. "
,,,,,"Overall, Paseo definitely knows how to make a killer sandwich. It's beyond messy and you'll need a few napkins, but it's totally worth the mess and the drive to come here. If you're visiting Seattle, Paseo is a must try or you'll regret it until your next visit to this beautiful city!"
,,,,,"It's been years since we've been... the onions are still just as I remembered them. Love to see more options on the menu, including vegan/vegetarian options!"
,,,,,"Would be a five-stars but, my most recent experience got me feeling real petty. "
,,,,,"I usually come here for the Caribbean Roast and fries w/ garlic aioli. 5 stars every time for the sandwich. Fries are nice, thick, fluffy and crunchy. Garlic Aioli is amazing. "
,,,,, 
,,,,,Street parking is available and usually easy to find 1-2 blocks away from the store. 
,,,,,"Now onto the bad experience. I had been craving scallops, and notice the #16 (Jambalaya) supposedly comes with prawns, scallops and andouille sausage. Toppings sounded good so I decided to take the chance. "
,,,,,"First off, it took a while for the jambalaya to come out. And I kept getting looks from the chef for some reason. And when I got the food the cashier seemed overly nice. I get to my car, opened up the Jambalaya and it was completely disappointing. Everything was just mushed together, which I can understand since I ordered togo and the food moves in the box. The second thing I noticed was that there were no SCALLOPS. There was prawns and what I assumed was Cod since they have cod on the menu. But cod was NOT listed as being part of the Jambalaya.The two things that I ordered the dish for (scallops and andouille sausage) was missing! I understand scallops are seasonal or whatever, but I dont get why theres no sausage. Not only that the dish reminded me of school lunch back at my highschool. I ate it just because I ordered it and didn't want to waste food. I did not finish the food. "
,,,,,"I was just like ... Wow, y'all coulda just told me you didn't have scallops and gave me a sandwich instead. "
,,,,,"I really don't recommend getting any of the rice dishes. They charge about 15-16$ for the rice dishes, and I can't justify the up-charge. Just stick with the sandwiches if you want a to assure a good experience."
,,,,,"ZOMG. Like, just, simply, ZOMG!!!"
,,,,,"The sandwiches here are seriously THAT. GOOD. You can't go wrong with anything here, but I went with the Caribbean roast which featured roasted pulled pork shoulder, aioli, cilantro, romaine, jalapeños, and caramelized onions. "
,,,,,"Mmm mmm, mmm hmm. Just foodg*smic if you're a meat lover. Can't say enough about it. Simply a delightfully goopy mess where I licked off all the bits and pieces that fell off, plus my fingers to boot. It's not cheap, but it is worth absolutely every. single. penny. Mmm hmm!"
,,,,,THANK YOU YELPERS for a great find!
,,,,,"Got way more than we expected. We got buffalo wings, Caribbean roast nachos, and their #1 Caribbean roast sandwich. Awesome value"
,,,,,Thank you James! We are so glad you enjoyed our happy hour goodies :)
,,,,,"I agree that Paseo probably has the best sandwich in the country; one of the best at least! I also had a bowl, which was also tasty, but the sandwiches take the cake. I had both the standard sandwich, and the version with accoutrements, but going forward I'll probably just go for the standard version, although they're both really good! Five stars for Paseo, and thanks for the free sandwich in exchange for an honest Yelp review!!!!! :)"
,,,,,One of my favorite food I got to tried when in Seattle!
,,,,,Small colorful shop. I don't recall seeing a large sign with the restaurant name on it so just look for the big crowd.  Line moves quickly. 
,,,,,Plenty of neighborhood and street parking around. 
,,,,,Cuban espresso shot - recommend. Slightly sweet and creamy. Surprisingly not bitter. 
,,,,,Caribbean roast sandwich - recommend. Their #1 and is a classic. Meat is soft and tender.
,,,,,Prawn sandwich - recommend. Prawn was very flavorful. You also get to pick spiciness level. I recommend the spiciest level 5 if you can handle a little heat. It has a good kick to it! 
,,,,,Roasted corn - I actually did not get to try this yet. It's currently with me on my flight back to Cali but looks like a must get for elote or corn lovers.
,,,,,"Really good sandwiches here.  They are HUGE and very filling.  I had the Paseo Press and it was such a good sandwich.  It has pork, ham, grilled onions, and cheese...delicious.  The place is really tiny and can get busy.  I came towards closing so the wait wasn't too bad.  The place is casual and is a tad dingy, but that is where the best foods are made.  "
,,,,,The service is great and ample street parking is available.

,,,,,"Sandwiches were so delicious, salsa for their chips was awesome. Order was for our staff and sandwiches were made quickly and wvweyone enjoyed it."
,,,,,"I've never had Caribbean food until Paseo, but I am so excited to try it again after this. My boyfriend and I were traveling, and walking around Fremont, and this was on his must-try list. We had eaten a good amount that morning, so I didn't order anything myself, but he got the Caribbean Roast sandwich. "
,,,,,"It took a couple of minutes, but the sandwich was ready pretty quickly. It came on a plate, wrapped in paper, and it was huge! I was so full already, but of course I had to try it, and once I did, I regretted having ate earlier in the day, and not having more room for the sandwich in my belly. Everything about the sandwich was perfect: the bread was soft; the pork shoulder was so succulent and cooked to perfection; and the grilled onions and jalapeños complimented the flavors and tied everything in. "
,,,,,"I definitely want to come back to Paseo to try everything on their menu. Looking forward to the rice dishes, also. If the owners ever open a shop in Southern California, they'll have two loyal customers already!"
,,,,,Instagram: @jhaseats
,,,,,Stick with the pork it is amazing either the sandwich or the plate. So flavorful and the portions are generous. I always end up with two meals. The scallops I had once and they do taste great but I was left hungry. 
,,,,,"Another favorite of our house is the special corn on the cob. Not the side of a half corn with just butter that one is a bit boring. The special full corn with all sorts of stuff on it. I also like the white rice. Something about it is different, like a sweetness that is addictive. "
,,,,,One area they could improve is the chips. Hey are a bit boring and always seem on the edge of being stale. 
,,,,,One of the delivery sites has them listed which is great and yet dangerous too! Yum!
,,,,,They have the best sandwiches and plates. If I could get anything there I would get the Caribbean roast and the elote. It's a must try if you have just moved to the area or just passing by!
,,,,,Yum! I couldn't wait to try Paseo out based on the reviews it received on Yelp and we were happy to leave completely pleased with our food.
,,,,,"First and foremost: yes, I will admit that this was a ridiculously messy sandwich. I think that more than half the ingredients that were part of it weren't even in between the two halves of bread to begin with. Work around: fork & knife! So worth it. "
,,,,,"I ordered the Sautéed Prawns sandwich & my fiancé ordered the Caribbean Roast sandwich. All of their sandwiches come on a baguette with mayo, cilantro, lettuce, jalapeños, and lots of caramelized onions. I didn't try much of the Caribbean Roast but my fiancé said it was really good. The Sautéed Prawns were good as well. I ordered the sandwich at a level 1 spice and thought it still had a kick to it because of the jalapeños."
,,,,,"Overall, big and tasty sandwich, a little bit on the expensive side, but really good. We will be back the next time we are in Seattle!"
,,,,,"On a student's budget, I often don't like paying double digits for a sandwich, because I never really think a sandwich is THAT good to warrant me spending over $10 on it... but I was not disappointed when I got the chance to try Paseo's AMAZING Caribbean Roast (only $9.75!). It lives up to its hype. Such a simple sandwich but with flavors that mesh so well together. The pork was so soft and marinated with some delicious Paseo concoction that made me want to keep eating despite how full I was getting. It was a little on the sweeter side, especially since there were also caramelized onions, so the jalapenos were a great touch. Not much lettuce was present, but not a big deal. My boyfriend and I got the Caribbean Roast and the Paseo Press and split them half/half so we could try both! We ended up wishing we just got the Roast. The Press ($11.50) just kind of had a lot going on with the added ham. I wasn't a big fan of the banana peppers either since I like the jalapenos with the sweeter pork they have. Still good I guess, but the Roast had already stolen my heart."
,,,,,"Also, the roasted corn is a must! It's a little on the pricey side at $4 each, but if you check in on Yelp, you get $1 off! It's like a healthier seeming version of Mexican street corn aka elotes... healthier mostly because there's less mayo than it'd usually have."
,,,,,"Street parking only -- I went on a Friday afternoon and found spots right across the street. Also, there's limited seating inside and some benches outside, so might have to grab it to-go if you're coming at normal lunch/dinner time."
,,,,,great little place to stop in and grab a sandwich.
,,,,,We got the Paseo sandwich which was packed with a couple different types of meat and it was juicy and so flavorful.
,,,,,"I also got the Paseo plate witch I chose the shrimp for the protein and it was perfectly balanced with the side beet salad, black beans, and corn. Very clean eating indeed."
,,,,,Don't forget the Yelp check-in and get yourself a dollar off your beer!
,,,,,"What a savory sandwich! Just scrumptious. I got there on Tuesday morning around 11:30. I walked right in, no 40 min line. I asked a few questions about the sandwiches and the girl seemed bothered.  Then I had told them when I ordered it was to eat there not to go they still made it to go. The guy before me also has the same issue but the worker went ahead and got him a plate, when it was my turn she tells me go get the plate and points telling me they are right over there( in the counter).I ordered their most popular sandwich. I ate the whole thing. $9.95 for it. My family enjoyed it too. Prepare to get your hands all dirty!  "
,,,,,"Overall is a good Sammie to try but let's just be clear, THIS IS NOT CUBAN! Though the pork has a great carribean taste to it, I wouldn't call it Cuban. I lived in the east coast and I know what a true Cuban sandwich is. Give it a try. It's a must in Seattle. Walking distance to the troll (15 min walk)"
,,,,,I had seen the photos.  I had read the other reviews.  And now I get it.  These sandwiches are top notch and should be consumed by e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e visiting Seattle.
,,,,,Hubs and I both ordered up their famous Grilled Pork Sandwich ($9.75) and oh. my. what a sandwich!
,,,,,"I, for one, was surprised at how big the sandwich was.  Despite being pretty hungry when we arrived, I had some trouble finishing it up.  Not only is the roll itself long (they use baguettes) but the sandwich is PACKED with good things: cubed pork, cilantro, pickled jalapenos, romaine and caramelized onions. All of these things add up to not just a lil' sandwich but a meal!  The only thing I did not love was the lettuce.. unless you eat your sandwich quickly that lettuce turns soggy.  I ended up picking out a lot from the 2nd half."
,,,,,"But the star of course is the pork!  So tender, so juicy, so good. Make sure you grab extra napkins!  That pork will for sure be running down the side of your hand - no matter how neat of an eater you think you are - this is a juicy messy (yet still delicious) sandwich.*"
,,,,,A few other misc notes: 
,,,,,If you can swing it - go during off-hours.  We found ourselves headed into Freemont on a Tuesday afternoon just after lunch - it was a great time to go!  There was only one couple in front of us..
,,,,,There's not a lot of seating here.  A handful of tables inside and a couple long picnic style tables outside. 
,,,,,There's a bus stop about half a block up that'll take you right back downtown.
,,,,,* Restrooms available to get yourself cleaned up.
,,,,,Super yum and juicy sandwich and roasted corn. I went with my girl friend for lunch on a Friday around 1:00. No lines. We shared the sandwich and two roast corns. They are big enough for two of us.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"I haven't visited this location of Paseo's-the very first!-in almost a decade, but I often frequent the new location in SODO before baseball games and when I'm craving a Cuban sandwich. My go-to sandwich is the Smokin Thighs chicken sandwich. Sometimes I'll spring for the garlicky prawns, but the smokin' thighs' sandwich sets the bar for a chicken sandwich for me. In a decade, the price of this sandwich has only increased by 2 or so dollars. Its a steal now when it used to be a splurge on a college kid's $7 minimum wage budget. "
,,,,,"On my recent visit, I was happy to see they now take credit cards and much of the ambiance hasn't changed. Paseo's still embodies the casual and grungey setting that Seattle used to have. When SLU was still industrial and not bougey. On a recent Wednesday night, there was no line at 7 p.m. and street parking was free and plentiful. My sandwich came with a generous portion of chicken and onions. Those onions make this sandwich and others on the menu what it is. Thick cut slices caramelized to a crunchy not soggy texture. My only complaint was that my chicken was fattier than usual and slightly cold. But, it still was flavorful like I remembered. "
,,,,,"Overall, I'd recommend Paseo's, but the SODO location is still my preferred location with its Happy Hour, parking lot, ample seating, and close proximity to sports venues. I wish it was open past 7 p.m., but I'll still come to the Fremont for my Paseo's fix after 7!"
,,,,,"Duuuuuude!! This place is bomb!! My boyfriend and I ordered the Caribbean Plato with roast pork to-go and enjoyed it at Gas Works Park. Everything on that plate was delicious - the roasted pork, rice, beans, salad and corn - all ingredients complimented each other very well. Portions were also huge. We cleaned our plates! I can't even put into words how good it was... "
,,,,,15/10 I would go back here!!!
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I shared 2 sandwiches. He had the Caribbean roast with roasted pork, but the star was the Paseo press - "
,,,,,"roasted pork with banana peppers, draped smoked ham, Swiss cheese, and caramelized onions. I highly recommend the Paseo press if you're a fan of Cubano sandwiches. It had similar flavor and ingredients, but on a whole different level and so much better. The flavor was so elevated, in the middle of my first bite my eyes widened in awe, and all I could say was wow. There was no shortage of meat - it was flavorful and juicy, and the bread was hefty enough to carry its weight without falling apart. Probably one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had."
,,,,,"Expensive for a sandwich in their type of setting, but I'm not even mad. The Paseo press was $11.50 but totally understandable. The sandwich was so huge and had thick layers of meat and cheese. I could only eat half, so I made two meals out of it!"
,,,,,"It's a nice location in a friendly neighborhood, and close to the Fremont Troll if you're a tourist in Seattle."
,,,,,"I swear when our Uber driver dropped us off, I thought he just left us in the middle of the street. We walked up and down the road to try and find this place, but it was literally in front of our face. To me it seemed a little hidden. But I'm glad we finally made our way inside."
,,,,,"This little place barely seats any one, so I highly suggest just grabbing your food on the go. Although the place is cramped the food was delicious! "
,,,,,"Most definitely recommend getting their signature sandwich. It's jam packed with lots of meat, so no doubt every bite won't disappoint you. The sautéed onions were a great compliment to the sandwich as well, but the only down side was that the slipperiness of the onions made the sandwich fall apart. After a few bites it looked like an open faced sandwich because everything was just falling apart. None the less it was very tasty, even if I had to eat it with a fork"
,,,,,"The shrimp plate was mehhhh, that's guna be a hard pass for me. It came with rice, a side salad, and a side of beans. There was probably only 6 pieces of shrimp in that huge tray so the ratio was a little off to me. There wasn't any thing particularly special about it, so stick with the sandwich!"
,,,,,We loved out takeout sandwiches from this cute little restaurant!  Will definitely visit again.
,,,,,A little hole in the wall sandwich shop but oh my goodness... You must go! This was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The pork had so much flavor and the toppings made it the perfect amount of heat and a little bit of sweet
,,,,,The sandwiches are big enough to share and don't forget a side of delicious fries and a real Coke
,,,,,"Great sandwiches but staff are not wearing masks or not wearing them correctly. Watched a staff take his mask off so he could look at the food, breathing on it, then put my sandwich in a bag and brought it out to me. When I told him he needs to cover his whole face the whole time while working he just said ""oh"" and gave me a blank stare."
,,,,,"Hi Sam, "
,,,,,"Thank you for leaving us a review and letting us know about this experience. It helps us to ensure all staff are following correct protocol, especially now while it is so important to handle food safely. "

,,,,,"- Famous Roasted Corn $5 - good, but quite pricey."
,,,,,We got Paseo for our organization's Winter Celebration and our staff was SO excited when they heard the news! They did not miss a beat! The food was delicious with plenty of options for different dietary restrictions! They were also thoughtful to include hand wipes and mints with the order! They really thought of everything.
,,,,,Would definitely recommend their services for a group event!
,,,,,I had high expectations for this place since my friend had recommended it. 
,,,,,"Firstly, the restaurant itself is tiny. There's about 5 small tables inside and a community table outside. I wouldn't recommend bringing a large party. "
,,,,,"The menu is extensive; however, my boyfriend and I ordered the first thing that caught our eyes-The scallops and carribean roast! "
,,,,,"The scallop sandwich was delicious. The bread was perfectly crispy. The sauce was tasty! But the scallops themselves were so buttery and soft. The only downside was that my sandwich was 90% onions. The scallop to bread ratio was disappointing, especially for the price they charge. "
,,,,,We ordered it medium spicy but there was hardly a kick to it. 
,,,,,"The carribean roast was mighty fine. Jam packed with tender meat and onions. Again, a little too much onion. The meat was so juicy and savory! The bread got soggy and we had eaten it just seconds after it came out. That was a bummer. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches themselves were extremely greasy. It gets real messy so be ready to grab napkins! The portion size is decent. One sandwich fills you up comfortably but not to the point of feeling stuffed. Overall, the sandwiches were really flavorful. I really wish the bread wasn't soggy. Hope they find a way to work around that!"

,,,,,I paid more than $16 for the jambalaya and the portions were super tiny.. The food at Paseo tastes good by what's the deal with these puny portions? I was so pumped to try Paseo based on the hype but I was pretty disappointed and still hungry.
,,,,,"Hi Brandon, "
,,,,,"We're very sorry that this was your first experience at Paseo and would like to apologize. This is not up to Paseo standards and we are going to speak to staff about this. We would love to make your Paseo experience right and give you a lunch or dinner on us. Again, we sincerely apologize and this is not what a Paseo meal should be. "
,,,,,-Paseo Team
,,,,,"I tried the Caribbean Roast, which is their most popular sandwich. I thought the sandwich was okay, nothing too special. "
,,,,,Also got a chance to try the scallops - over rice and in a sandwich
,,,,,The scallops over rice came with a lot of red sauce - which was just a tomato sauce. This dish could've used more rice. 
,,,,,"The sandwich however, was delicious!! The garlic sauce in it was bombbb diggity! Hands down my favorite thing here. "
,,,,,"Their bread is a bit too small though, everything falls out! Super messy"
,,,,,I'd come back just for the scallop sandwich!
,,,,,#1 Caribbean Roast: 5/5 This was just mwah! I love the juicy and tender meat. The jalapeños definitely compliments the meat with something sour and refreshing to balance the fattiness. I would highly recommend!!
,,,,,Caribbean fries: 4/5 Fries were a little salty on my end but the aioli made me forget about the saltiness!
,,,,,"Nice neighborhood hole in the wall feel to this joint! I got the number one and loved the juicy, melt ones of the roasted pork shoulder. The bread was nice and supple enough to hold the onions, pork, and aioli which was greatly appreciated l."
,,,,,"I think $11 + tax is a bit pricey for a roast pork sandwich, but it was a good sandwich! One thing I was looking for was a little more acidity to balance the pork and caramelized onions, but overall, I was satisfied!"
,,,,,"On a Friday at noon, there wasn't as many people as I expected. We were able to order right away, and the service was quick. "
,,,,,"We got the Caribbean roast and chicken thighs to go, and brought them to Fremont brewing co to enjoy them with beers. We must have done the right thing, cause as soon as we started eating both groups around us ordered from Paseo and brought them back. Smelled so good. "
,,,,,"Obviously the Caribbean roast was a hit. The chicken thighs were also really great, but I see why the Caribbean roast is #1. The highlight was the bread - so incredibly chewy. I wonder where they get their bread from! Super glad we stopped by on our trip to Seattle - must try if you're in the Fremont area."
,,,,,"I hadn't had Paseo's in years, and was really excited to grab a sandwich from there this afternoon. I was disappointed when I received my sautéed prawn sandwich and it had a total of 4 prawns on the whole sandwich. I swear I remember previously the sandwiches were always loaded with deliciousness. When you're paying $12 for a sandwich, I'd expect a bit more substance to it."
,,,,,"Wow....what a sandwich!! If you're looking for a quality sandwich to eat in Seattle, Paseo's does the trick. Known for their Caribbean sandwiches, you'd be foolish to NOT order one!!"
,,,,,"The place is tiny ~ only a few tables inside the place. It gets really compact with the demand for their sandwiches out the door..literally. I wish there was more seating inside. There are benches outside but when it's freezing, that's not really an option. The service is quick!!"
,,,,,"I had to order their most famous sandwich, the Caribbean Roast, which comes with pork shoulder. The way that they marinated the meat is tremendous. It's juicy and delicious. I don't think they are lying when they say their meat is ""succulent"". You don't have to worry about the meat being dry at all. Beware though...it's not a neat meal. You will get your hands dirty since the juice just oozes out of the sandwich. It's a pretty messy meal but tastes so good! "
,,,,,I'll definitely be back!
,,,,,My wife got a marble in her sandwich and food poisoning last time we ordered. No thanks
,,,,,"Hi B.N, "
,,,,,We appreciate honest feedback from our guests and do everything we can to address the issue. We messaged you a few months ago regarding this situation when you left a similar review and we have not heard anything back. We’d like to figure out what’s going on as marbles are not something we ever have in our inventory at Paseo. Please email us at 
,,,,, so we can look into this and address it with our staff. Thank you
,,,,,Omg... after hearing about this place from many locals I FINALLY tried it and it does indeed live up to its reputation. I got there around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon be was expecting a huge line but there were only 3 people ahead of me. The only downside is that seating is very limited. I ended up bringing it home to enjoy it. 
,,,,,I got the Caribbean roast sandwich and shared with my bf. It was so juicy and I ate it with some peppers I had at home. 
,,,,,I definitely will be back to enjoy other dishes. 
,,,,,Parking is street parking only.
,,,,,"I was so disappointed.  This place has really declined. Jumbalaya had only a few shrimp. For the price, there was not much volume. Pulled pork sandwich, their signature, was so full of grease that it saturated both layers of paper wrapping and all over everything else in the bag.  It was also small and not much meat.  Corn chips were so salty as to be inedible.  There also were not very many.  Red sauce was great.  French fries were ample in volume, but also were very salty.  Aiole  sauce was great.  One more issue, after ordering online, the site said the order would be ready at a specific time, to the minute.  I arrived 12 minutes early and the food was waiting on the counter.  Based on the food temp, and the fat saturation, it had already been there awhile."

,,,,,Sandwiches did not live up to the hype for me. Had the one with the pork and scallops. Felt the flavor profile didn't really match well.
,,,,,"I usually don't opt for sandwiches for the fact that they get so messy, BUT I'll make an exception for these once in awhile. "
,,,,,"Recommendations: Their most popular sandwich, ""rated best sandwich in America"". This marinated & slow roasted pork shoulder sandwich comes with caramelized onions (BOMB), jalapeño, romaine, garlic aioli, and cilantro by default. Just let them know when ordering what needs to be omitted. The toasted baguette was my least favorite-- it was too hard for my liking."

,,,,,"The famous sandwich to get is the #1 (Caribbean Pork), but as I am a veggie I went for the #9 Tofu Delight. Came on a Sunday sunny afternoon and it wasn't too busy. I would say to sit outside if you can, inside is kinda a smokey hot mess and I feel like I would have come outta there smelling like onions for hours. Anyway! The sandwiches do take a few minutes and when you get them they are hot and dripping with delicious flavors. I wouldn't recommend taking these to-go or eating them later, they are for sure best fresh. The tofu was a perfect spice and this bread is a nice crispy baguette that soaks up all the pounds of onions on your sandwich. curious next time to try the rice plates to mix it up a bit. for sure worth going to if you're in town visiting and come hungry!"
,,,,,"Hi Kelsey, we are so glad you loved your Tofu Felight! One of our favorite vegetarian options is our Caribbean Plato with tofu if you're looking to try a plate next time you come by :)"
,,,,,"Such an amazing place, and should have left a redivide long before this (a staple of mine since I moved here 7 years ago!). The food continues to be delicious, and the Caribbean roast sandwich especially is not to be missed. Their corn is outstanding, and just about every prawn dish I've had here. I did a COVID-19 safe pick up from their, and was super impressed by their diligence and safety at the spot. It was seamless!"
,,,,,An experience of a sandwich. Plan your day around filling up on their #1! Tostones are a must as well.
,,,,,"My fiancé and I stopped by there before heading home from washington. We got here on a Wednesday around 11:30am and waited about 5 minutes. Score! Of course, we came here for the Caribbean roast sandwich and boy was it amazing and messy! The flavors were so juicy and the meat was so tender! Definitely a must stop if you are in Washington! We also got a chicken plate with some beans and corn. Beans were on point. Didn't care too much for the corn. It was bland. The place has very little seating but we got lucky enough to snag a table. There are tables outside too but i guess you can eat on the sidewalk"
,,,,,They don't have the Un Bien sauce. They couldn't find out how the sauce is made/reverse engineer it. Good effort though. At least they're open Mondays and Tuesdays.
,,,,,"I'm usually skeptical of places that claim they have ""the best sandwich in the US"" or ""the best [anything] in [anywhere on the planet]. I just have so many questions--what is the framework? What is the criteria? What are we optimizing for? I rate food based on where they price themselves. At $12 for a sandwich I'd say Paseo does a good job. If I had to rephrase their statement, I'd say Paseo has the best pulled pork sandwich in the Pacific Northwest. Thats not a small a statement."
,,,,,"(1) the sandwich is BIG, or for me it was big. I'd say the size of my forearm, I wear ~size 8 womens shoe. That for me is a big sandwich"
,,,,,"(2) its excruciatingly juicy, def not a date spot--its messy, it gets everywhere there is no classy way to have onion juices dribbling down your chin."

,,,,,"I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I was already in the area so I made a stop here for lunch round 2. Yes, round 2. I'm sad to report that it didn't live up to the hype. I'm so glad I went at an off time so there was no wait. I really didn't think it's worth it to wait and drive out of your way to check this place out. "
,,,,,"I split the Caribbean Pork Sandwich with my friend. I'm so glad I did because I wouldn't have enjoyed eating the entire thing by myself. The sandwich is definitely messy so napkins and forks are required. It resembled a banh mi with the cilantro and pork. There was an uneven distribution of ingredients so some parts lacked while others had too much. In addition,  tenderness and juiciness of the pork was very inconsistent. Some pieces were succulent and tender while others were dry and tougher."

,,,,,"These people don't play.  Plain and simple.  If someone tells you that this place isn't magical?  They're a liar.  Living on the other side of the country, I have had dreams of their sandwiches.  That's not an exaggerate.  I have literally had dreams about these sandwiches, with their perfectly caramelized onions and tender slow-roasted pork.  They are without a doubt the only sandwich on the menu in the cafeteria in heaven.  I've never ordered anything else here because I know that this sandwich is as delicious as it is messy...and that's sayin' something.  I'm not typically an aioli fan, but just do it.  Order this bad boy just the way it comes because their is some kind of black magic when it comes to this recipe and its flavor combinations!  "
,,,,,Note:  This place is tiny.  There will be a line around the building.  They only take cash.  All inconveniences that you will forget about when you take your first glorious bite.
,,,,,Good sandwiches. It's so easy to just grab a quick sandwich and head on to the Freemont brewery or the Gasworks park and enjoy it.
,,,,,The sandwich was well prepared. 100% would recommend the Caribbean roast; everything in that sandwich was how its supposed to be. These guys know what they are doing.
,,,,,Seating at the restaurant can be a mess though. It's a small joint.
,,,,,"Really tasty, filling sandwiches with friendly, quick service. They don't have dine-in right now, but there's a nice little park you can sit & eat at just around the corner. We got the #1 sandwich with pork and it was divine!"
,,,,,"Love Paseos at Fremont! Filling, fulfilling and fantastic food!! Tried all the bowls and sides, never disappointed."
,,,,,So my husband has never had a carribean sandwich and wanted to get him to try one.  Un Bien was closed so we came to Paseo's.
,,,,,I got the tofu sandwich with light onion and husband got the carribean roast. We also got a side of their corn. 
,,,,,When the sandwiches were ready we took them outside to the outdoor seating area. My tofu sandwich was ok. There were WAY too many onions and OIL. I had to pick out the onions and it still left a film of oil on the bread and such.  
,,,,,Husbands was the same way. Good flavor of the meat and tofu but overall isn't the same as Un Bien. 
,,,,,Would most likely not recommend much!
,,,,,"High expectation for this place but came out disappointed. The portion of the sandwich was good but nothing else. The jambalaya was way too salty, very oily. Same for the spicy vegetarian plate, very oily and spicy. A level 2 spicy level was very spicy, I can take Chinese Hop pot's Heat everyday, but not this. "
,,,,,"The fried calamari was a total joke, 6 pieces of barely 2"" long rubbery calamari strips is $7? I don't think so. "
,,,,,"The food came extremely slow in the afternoon way before dinner rush hour, we waited more than 40 minutes for our food. And there are only two more groups ordered before us. "
,,,,,This is my first low review in Seattle. The only two stars are for the sandwich.
,,,,,"Ok so Paseo is super famous for their sandwiches and they are to die for.  However you can also get Jambalaya, and multiple rice bowls which are also really good!   Btw I highly recommend this location by the stadium, it's much less crowded than the Fremont location."
,,,,,"Just moved here and wanted to check out the hype.... and Paseo definitely meets it. I even came twice during my first week of moving to Seattle. I've really only had their most popular sandwich, but really there are so many more I NEED to try. The sandwiches are a very decent size and trust me, I can eat. It can get messy eating, so I suggest having lots of napkins and even a plate near by. Given it's popularity, I would highly suggest calling in your order for pickup, but overall it's really quick."
,,,,,"Soooo, I didn't even time to take a photo because the moment I opened up what I had ordered I was in love and I just dove right in.  I literally thought I had ordered from heaven the millisecond I took a bite, and now I am very full and extremely happy.  And, so are my taste buds."
,,,,,"I ordered ""The Goods"" bowl with the chicken thigh (although I know it would have been delicious no matter which protein I ordered, but I was feeling a bit more chicken-ey today).  I actually debated on whether or not I wanted pork, but went with the chicken.  It came with rice, beans, and flavor that I am still drooling about.  Next time (like, in 4 hours - haha) I might try it with pork."
,,,,,"I know this place is very famous for their sandwich, but if that's all you've ever ordered or you're not feeling like the bread today - go ahead, try the bowl, treat yourself.  You will not be sorry!"
,,,,,Messy but really good.  This is my favorite sub place next to royal grinders.  The spices and flavors are really good and it is pretty quick as well.  The only thing I would say is that it is so messy that I would highly recommend not getting it to go unless you grab a lot of napkins.  I got my first one on the way to a friends house and lost half the sub on the way there because of the mess.  All that being said... worth the mess.

,,,,,best cuban sandwiches in seattle!!! If you're looking for something to pickup on the way to the beach this is the spot!
,,,,,"I'm guessing the cramped space, disorganized queueing, and bored counter staff are par for the course due to this sandwich shop's ""iconic"" status.  "
,,,,,"Make no mistake, the food is good.  But, greed sunk tipped the scales to ""meh.""  They charge you for ketchup.  You know those itsy-bitsy tiny little plastic condiment cups?  Yeah, those. They will set you back 2 for a dollar (and we know that a whole bottle of the stuff at the grocery star is less than that!).  Plus, you have to stand in line to order it (while your food gets cold).  If I'm eating a $12 sandwich and $5 fries, I think maybe a bit of gratis would create a bit of gratitude. "
,,,,,"Bad form, Paseo."
,,,,,"Hi Brant, "
,,,,,"We would like to deeply apologize for your experience at Paseo. Thank you for letting us know about this as it is not okay with us and we are going to speak to staff to make sure this doesn't happen again. Our staff should not have charged you for ketchup as this comes free with an order of fries. We currently have some new staff that may not have known this, and we would like to apologize again. We would love to welcome you back and show you a true Paseo experience with a lunch or dinner on us. Please email us at "

,,,,,Paseo Team
,,,,,"Ah, Un Bien's competitor. Paseo is definitely way high up on my list of favorite sandwich places, but I think Un Bien still edges this place out by a smidge."
,,,,,"I got their super popular Caribbean roast sandwich. Really good, but I thought there roast was slightly drier than what I was expecting. It comes in larger chunks, while from what I remember, the sandwich at Un Bien had more shredded meat. That being said, it was drenched in a ton of pork juice, and the bread mops it up really nicely. Pickled jalapenos added a nice kick. "
,,,,,"Not much seating area, so most people get to-go. I also got the combo meal, which was pretty worn because you also get a side of roasted corn. I'll probably be stopping by a lot."
,,,,,"Messy but amazing sandwiches!! I tried the Friday to Sunday scallop sandwich special, the sautéed prawns sandwich, and the famous Caribbean roast sandwich. I think the scallop sandwich was definitely one of the more interesting ones. I was expecting really small scallops, but they were huge! The sautéed prawns sandwich was also pretty good. It had a little kick to it, but it was still manageable. My absolute favorite was the #1 famous Caribbean roast. The pork shoulder meat was so tender and the caramelized onions are a must on this sandwich. Their garlic aioli sauce smothered the toasted baguettes, but the baguettes surprisingly maintained its crunch."
,,,,,Good but slow af. I want to like this since it's right near me but have always ended up with a greasy sandwich and waiting around an extra 20 minutes for my order.
,,,,,Yelp prices are wrong. Their website prices are wrong. Their website menu is old. I didn't bother asking for confirmation of the price before leaving to pick it up. I regret that the most! 
,,,,,I came in expecting to pay no more than $12 and was greeted with a $19 price mark.  No sandwich is that good. No sandwich! 
,,,,,No need to review the Food. I feel deceived and robbed somehow. I should've just declined to get the food but I'm not that type of person. That's a HUGE price difference and I'm sure the food isn't much different than it was when the sandwich was only $8.50! Definitely wouldn't have added the corn if I had known that as well. I won't waste my time or theirs coming back.
,,,,,"I'm honestly torn on this review. I used to absolutely love Paseo, but feel like it's been on a downward trend. I've been a few times since COVID and both times the front staff were absolutely overwhelmed by the orders. "
,,,,,"This time I thought I'd skip the line and order online ahead. I got to the store front and checked in - food wasn't ready. No big deal, I got there a little early. However - multiple large families arrived, looked over menus, ordered, and received food while my ticket was still sitting on the printer with a bunch of others. It took over 45 minutes from order to getting my food.We finally got the order and found they totally forgot dressing for the salad, and didn't have any cheese on the corn once we got home. They also started wrapping the sandwiches in tin foil so now the sandwiches just steam (aka making the bread soggy). "
,,,,,"Aside from the food - the staff need a lesson in public health and general hygiene. If your shorts and underwear are so low that I can see their butt crack, it's not a great start to my opinion of cleanliness. Him wearing his mask below his nose resting on upper lip, constantly pulling up his shorts (literally touching the exposed butt every time) with the same gloves he is using to put food in bags for customers was rough. "
,,,,,All around this was a rough visit that capped off some declining quality over the last few visits. My business is now going to Un Bien.
,,,,,"Don't get the fries, bland."
,,,,,"If it's your first time, get the #1. I got the #2 and it wasn't as flavorful. I loved that there was no line. Waited about 5 minutes."
,,,,,So good. Got the Caribbean and it is messy and spicy (jalapeños in the sandwich). Ordered from uber eats!
,,,,,Classic. Get the pork sandwich if this is your first time. Guaranteed to satisfy. Parking around the area can be tough so walk if possible.

,,,,,"THIS IS THE PLACE FOR A BOMB, FLAVORFUL SANDWICH YALL!! I got the scallop sandwich and it was loaded up. Definitely greasy but delicious."
,,,,,"I only ever get the carribean roast sandwich, its pretty good. Not as good as the desi sandwich from bongos IMO, but paseo is closer to where I live so I end up going here more often. The sandwiches can be hit or miss, sometimes they will be dripping with sauce and other times almost completely dry. The meat also just tastes better or worse depending on the day and time you go there. Their fries are amazing, they have this sugary and spicy seasoning on them and they go great with their aioli. Overall, pretty solid spot to get a carribean/cuban sandwich."
,,,,,My friend really liked the award wining sandwich. I got prawn one which is good but not too special.
,,,,,"Ugh. The Caribbean roast sandwich - it's a bit greasy, it's messy, and so damn DELICIOUS!! I honestly don't even know how many times I've had it since moving to Seattle. It's just a staple item in my diet at this point. Tender juicy roast, thick sweet grilled onions, and that amazing aioli!!! It's perfect. "
,,,,,Also good:
,,,,,Caribbean fries - Idk what they season it with but I'm addicted. Comes with the amazing aioli.
,,,,,"Roasted corn - I'm sorry but it might even be better than elote loco. It's the aioli, I swear."
,,,,,Citrus salad w/ roast - They really heap on the protein!!  You get your money's worth. It's refreshing and surprisingly amazing. 
,,,,,Tldr: I love this place. Aioli. Just go.
,,,,,"PASEO. You were one of the highlights of our Seattle trip. The caribbean roast was SO, so, so, so good. The meat so tender and wrapped in a wonderful carb-y, bread goodness. WOW. So impressed by this wonderful sandwich. The pork is roasted and marinated so perfectly with grilled onions. Our chicken bowl was also very good; the tender chicken just made me so happy inside. It also came with chips,so the bowl could also double as nachos. Overall, what an experience. This was amazing, amazing. Would come back again for sure. Ambience is cute, with a couple of tables. Pretty small inside, and I could see it getting really crowded at a more peak time (we went around 2pm and it was pretty busy)."
,,,,,"I visited Paseo for the first time on New Years' day, and their ordering system was down, but the staff still powered through a very hectic day! I really appreciated them being open for the holiday, and that they worked SO hard (and even trained a guy on the spot for more help) during Their service. It took about an hour from when I first got to the line until I got to enjoy my sandwich, but it was worth it!"
,,,,,"It is uncommon for a sandwich place that is best known for a meaty sandwich to have fulfilling vegetarian dishes, but these guys have 2 veg sandwiches on the menu! I was impressed that they were not just cold vegetable sandwiches. I ordered the Tofu delight which comes with firm tofu, EVOO, garlic tapenade, jalapeños, very thick caramelized onions, and a habenero oil (from which you can order spice level 0-5). I ordered mine with spice level 2, and was very happy.  The tofu was seasoned well and did not just taste like mush, and the bread really complimented the tapenade, sauces, and onions. It was delicious, but very oily and heavy. So come hungry, drink water, and use the moist towelettes that they provide at the register to wipe your hands after the meal. "
,,,,,"They sold out of corn, but I do hope to try it the next time I visit Seattle!"
,,,,,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday evening for dinner. We ordered our food to go - I got the Scallop Entree and he got the Caribbean Roast sandwich. We hadn't been in for a long time so we were both looking forward to it. My excitement faded when I got home and opened my dinner though. The scallop entree was described as scallops simmered in the red house sauce, which I was really excited to try, but instead what I got was five sad looking scallops shoved in the corner of the container next to the beans. I'm not sure who put this together and thought it looked like a fully prepared dish. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's sandwich and it was also a bit underwhelming. It didn't have as much flavor as I remember the sandwich having and there were only a few small pieces of caramelized onion tucked away between the meat."
,,,,,"Overall, I was not impressed and I don't think we will be returning. For future Caribbean cravings, we'll definitely be going to Un Bien."
,,,,,"Hi Monica, "
,,,,,"We would like to deeply apologize for the food you were served Tuesday evening. This is not acceptable with us & we are speaking to staff to ensure they are clear on expectations for what our food should look like. We would love to have you back & show you what a true Paseo experience should be, please email us at "
,,,,, and we can send you a gift card for your next visit.
,,,,,"Still a decent sandwich, but no longer as special as before the owner transition a few years ago."
,,,,,"This place lives up to the hype.  We loved the grilled pork sandwich (#1 on the menu), but will probably pass on the midnight Cuban press next time.  It wasn't bad, just very pickled-peppery."
,,,,,Repeat word of caution: they run out of sandwiches in the early evening.  Gottta get here in the off hours if you don't want to wait in a long line.
,,,,,Consistently delicious. Often there is a Groupon available. Have had their sandwiches and also their plates. Both are great.
,,,,,The best sandwich shop hands down in the Fremont area. Always love taking my friends here from out of town. The number 3 is one of the best.

,,,,,Always fills up my teens and such amazing flavors! This is hands down the best takeout for family. Order early as demand is high!
,,,,,Parking is available in the neighborhoods on and along 43rd st. Inside is small and there Is a large table outdoors for larger groups.
,,,,,Tried the single shot of their Cuban espresso and it was delicious. Very smooth and flavorful coffee.
,,,,,"For the sandwiches, got to try the prawn sandwich and the classic Mediterranean. First off the sandwiches are huge. Second their garlic onions packed into the sandwiches gives the sandwich nice flavor. The prawns were delicious and the pork in the classic was slow roasted and delicious as well."
,,,,,"My only criticism is the bread is very thick, which made it a little difficult to eat, but flavor wise 5/5!"
,,,,,"My boyfriend and went to Seattle together for the first time and Paseo was our first stop straight from the airport! We arrived shortly after they opened at 11am, so the line wasn't long. It's a little shack with limited indoor and outdoor seating. Street parking only. "
,,,,,"I ordered the infamous Caribbean Roast sandwich which is apparently the second best sandwich in America. I also got the roasted corn ($1 off with Yelp check in)! They have a water spout, but it's not that cold and kinda tastes weird, so we got a can of soda. "
,,,,,"The corn was big, juicy, and flavorful! It's like a Mexican elote. The sandwich was absolutely delicious! Very very messy, but so worth it. You definitely can't eat this in your car, unless you want juicy pork all over your lap. The pork is tender and the bread is toasty but not painful to eat. The caramelized onions are sweet and perfectly soft.  "
,,,,,"We realized later that night that we were actually given the Paseo Press, not the Caribbean Roast! So we went back a couple days later to try the true Caribbean Roast. It was just as good! The difference is that it has lettuce and jalapeños, while the Paseo Press has banana peppers, cheese, and ham. Whichever you choose to get, you will love it! "
,,,,,"I'm happy that I got to eat something so amazing, but sad that there is nothing comparable in Sacramento. I'd definitely return and recommend!"
,,,,,"One of the best sandwich shops in Seattle! Hands down, go check it out now! My boyfriend and I initially wanted to check out the shop with the original recipe called Un Bien, however they were closed. I get we came on a Tuesday, but still! When we got to Paseo, there was a handful of people waiting to get their sandwiches. Luckily we got our order in and food came out fast. The pulled pork is tender and incredibly juicy. Great bread, sauce and pickles! Must try if you're in Seattle!"
,,,,,BRUH.
,,,,,"Tell me why I had to order a second round of their sandwiches because of how good it was. I was already full, but it was just so great."
,,,,,"The first time I came to this place, I fell in love. My recent visit to Seattle, I definitely had this on my MUST-VISIT list. What I usually order is the Caribbean roast. It's juicy, packed, and cut in half for easy eating. Price isn't too bad for the quality of the food and the service given. "
,,,,,"The place is a little small, so if it gets busy, it can get pretty crowded, but no worries. They have tables to eat outside. Parking isn't too bad either, but it is street parking. "
,,,,,"It's hard to spot the restaurant from far away because they have no signs except a small one on their door, but you'll know which one it is when you see crowds of people eating outside and inside."
,,,,,"Visit this place, it's worth it. Definitely will come back the next time I visit Seattle again."
,,,,,Literally a little shack as a storefront that serves some great food.
,,,,,"As you walk in, you're hit with an aroma that can only be described as delicious. The interior of the place looks like it could be straight from the 80s. We got here around 3pm, so it wasn't super packed because it's that awkward time between lunch and dinner (linner???). "
,,,,,"We all ordered the Caribbean Roast because it's supposed to be ""rated best sandwich in America"". When the cashier called our number, we had our sandwiches served on a plate that you would find at a Chinese restaurant. The sandwich was wrapped with a few thick slices of grilled onion and stacked high up with pork, lettuce, pickled jalapeños and cilantro. Everything had the right amount of seasoning, but I also felt like something was missing..."
,,,,,I wished the baguette was toasted a bit longer because it felt a little soggy from the meat and onion juices...
,,,,,"Best sandwich in Seattle, several years running. Even more convenient now that you can order online and pickup without waiting in a long line."
,,,,,"Probably not the best person to review this, since I was having a hella grumpy day and the wait here did not make things better."
,,,,,"Pro tip 1: uber here, and don't be like me....walked all the way from U Dub..."
,,,,,"I don't like to call foods ""fatty"" because all foods are beautiful, but this was probably the sloppiest, and oiliest sandwich I have ever encountered. The meat juice, butter stuff and caramelized onion juice was just leaking everywhere! It was hard to eat sitting down, I can't imagine people do takeout for this!"
,,,,,This is more for DRUNCHIES than a nice sandwich post hike or something. I felt so sick just taking one bite...
,,,,,"This place is super duper small, so most people take to-go. I think they have another location opened elsewhere, but this is the OG. "
,,,,,"Pro tip 2: if anything, AVOID THE SANDWICHES. GET A PLATE INSTEAD."
,,,,,"Price wise, it was kind of expensive. I can get some nice Caribbean food in the bay area (Back a Yard, anyone?)."
,,,,,Mediocre experience. No highlights. +1 for meat overload.
,,,,,Talk about pork overload...!
,,,,,"We made a trip out to Paseo to try their sandwiches. First of all, this place has no sign and would have been easily missed if I hadn't looked up pictures of this place prior to coming. Very worn down, tiny little place with only about 5 or 6 little tables. We ordered the Caribbean roast and Paseo press. Both were good and packed with strong flavors..almost felt like I was eating some pho at times :o but it was super messy and wet. SO HARD TO EAT! There is no way this can be eaten on the go. You will also need a wad of napkins and some wet tissues to work through it. Honestly, what turned me off was their cleanliness or lack thereof. Their bathroom was dirty and very close to the table right outside (patrons sitting there could probably hear you pee and whatnot) lol. Probably not a place I'd recommend :/"
,,,,,"One thing I won't voluntarily eat unless I'm starving is a sandwich, but their sandwich is an exception!!! My bf dragged me here for dinner and I still remember I was complaining about why he brought me to a sandwich place. I even avoided ordering their sandwich and got a jambalaya bowl for myself. However, after my first bite of his sandwich, I regretted for what I did! The roasted pork in the sandwich is super juicy and marinated perfectly. I also loved the delicious grilled onions and other veggies. The bread is also quite crunchy. In short, it is the opposite of what I usually hate the sandwich for!! The jambalaya was a bit too spicy for us given that we only ordered a 1 in the 0-5 spice scale. There is some fish, shrimp and scallops in it but not much. The overall taste is still quite good. I'll definitely come back for the sandwiches!!"
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"The Caribbean sandwich IS a five-star sandwich, but for my money and my husband's, America's #1 sandwich is still the chicken maroosh at Saad's in Philly.  But that's okay!  This was still excellent.  Fries were nicely seasoned and crisped, corn was tasty if a little over cooked.  Good service."
,,,,,Came again after two years since my family wanted to give it another chance. It is worse than last time. We could not finish it like it because it tasted bad. No taste at all. The bread was not panini-style and tasted weird and the chicken tastes like it is days old. Everything tastes like orange juice and ginger. Do not spend your money here. I had to reheat food from last night since we were hungry. Unbelievable it seems their goal is to make their dishes as worse as possible. No thank you.
,,,,,"Came here today around 2 pm and there was no line. This should have been a sign. The sandwich lacked flavor, not enough sauce nor jalapenos. The chicken breast is obviously not cooked with ingredients like before. It is like he ones you buy in big quantity in Costco. Un bien sells better sandwiches. Not returning!"
,,,,,"Thank you for your reviews. We went tonight, got lost, it was raning and with a toddler. But we all went down and ordered, even my daughter was liking the smell.  We ordered the chicken sandwich. But the sandwichera was not working. Still it was so good we ate in the car as there were not tables available. I saw them serving a plate of rice and chicken. The quantity look huge compared to the puertorican restaurant in Ballard. We are returning soon to Paseo for the rice and beans ! ¡Muchas gracias!"
,,,,,"I am a vegetarian so I decided to get the onion sandwich. Although I enjoyed the caramelized onions, they were cut too big for my liking making it impossible for me to take a bite without having the rest of the onions fall out. The aioli was really good and it was somewhat spicy, but the onions were cut too big"
,,,,,"When I told different friend groups that I was coming to visit, they all recommended this place. That should say enough already. "
,,,,,"I came during a bad weekend (Fremont Festival?), so I circled forever looking for street parking, and failed. I heard that finding parking is usually not that difficult though. There is both indoor and outdoor seating available. "
,,,,,"Definitely get the ROASTED CORN. It's like an elote corn-on-the-cob, smothered in beautiful sauce and spices. "
,,,,,"Highly recommend the CARIBBEAN ROAST & PASEO PRESS. Both pulled pork shoulder sandwiches, so very hearty. They definitely do not skimp out on the meat. There were a lot of flavors on both. Paseo Press was saltier because of the ham, but I thought the banana peppers gave it a good kick. "
,,,,,Really great sandwiches and well worth their price!!
,,,,,It was the best sandwich in Seattle or world at large. Still the same as days of old but with a twist of new. If you're in Seattle for the first time. This is a must eat place. I highly recommend it.
,,,,,I'm not sure I've had a better sandwich.. anywhere? 
,,,,,Delicious! 
,,,,,My only suggestion? More mustard! 
,,,,,Will definitely stop by again next time we're passing through Seattle.
,,,,,Pricey & not worth the hype. Went up to order - cashier was talking to somebody despite seeing me walk up. Received no assistance for 3 minutes. Ordered chicken breast sandwich & tofu sandwich with a side of corn. 
,,,,,"Corn was the biggest waste of $5. It's pretty but tastes nothing special. It's bland. Don't know what the hype was about. Chicken breast sandwich is good, but not stuffed with enough meat. Tofu is meh. 2/5. Bad service & ok food. Will not return."
,,,,,"It's been about 15 years since I had my first Paseo sandwich. To be honest, that first bite was so good, it was a pivotal coming of age experience. Since then, I've tried to find a sandwich as good as this, and haven't been able to (with the exception of un bien, which long story short is basically just as legit if not more). This is the best sandwich I've had in my life. Nothing else needs to be said."
,,,,,I stopped by for lunch and maybe it because I'd heard so much about Paseo but it wasn't as good as I expected.
,,,,,"Hi Eric, thank you for your feedback! We’d love to hear how we can improve. Please email us at "
,,,,, 
,,,,,Thank you!
,,,,,"We ordered pick up last night during the ""Coronavirus pandemic"" the staff was super friendly and our sandwiches were yummy! I ordered the chicken breast sandwich and my husband has the pork sandwich - both were HUGE! We should have shared one! Thanks for a great take out experience during an otherwise ""strange"" week!"

,,,,,5 stars for food- had the #2 Paseo Press. Friends had the #1 (details second paragraph). #2 Paseo Press AMAZING. Seems like a vamped up Cuban sandwich on crack - more like crack in the crack- sauce. The sauce was mixed into the pork while on top- leaving it super moist and tasteful. With a slab of Swiss (heaven since I'm a cheese lover). Decent bread ratio- tried to take off some since I'm cutting back- but added it right back into the bite. Honestly could only eat half of the sandwich. Could have shared it with my mum. Says it has pickled jalapeños but didn't have a spicy kick to it for me. I could only taste the sour of the banana peppers (which I prefer).
,,,,,The friends had the #1 Caribbean Roast. Mixed reviews- One said 4.5 stars- was tender and juicy. Good flavor. The other said 2.5 stars- needed some more sauce (but this was coming from a gal who puts ketchup on EVERYTHING).
,,,,,"4.5 stars for atmosphere. I liked the smallness of the place. Lacks indoor seating which is why I took the half a point off, but the picnic tables outside with the lights are fun- sets a communal vibe. Plus could enjoy the weather even from the inside- big open windows."
,,,,,"Once again the sandwiches in this place do not disappoint. So fresh juicy and delicious, you need 6 napkins just to eat one and they are delicious . I think the fan fare of being on a food network show has worn off , we walked in ate right away and actually got a table . The last time we where in town there was a line up around the corner . "
,,,,,"My only issue however is the washroom , I would give 5 stars for the food and staff but the washroom left me feeling like I needed a full body sanitization after I used it . After washing my hands I still felt the need to use sanitizer . Urine all over the seat and floor . "
,,,,,Obviously someone has an issue but with the amount of customers in the washroom should have and could have been cleaned better .
,,,,,"So good! I ordered from Paseo on Uber Eats. I tried the red sauce plato with tiger prawns. It was really good, and came with a lot of food! I got level 3 spicy, and definitely could've gone for 4. The flavors were really great and I enjoyed having the rice with the prawns. The corn was also perfect, and had some of the red sauce flavor from being in the same box. Really tasty and would definitely recommend their take out!"
,,,,,"Hi Mackenzie, "
,,,,,"Thanks for your review! We're so glad you enjoyed your red sauce plato. Since you enjoyed the prawns, we recommend trying our Sauteed Prawn sandwich next! "
,,,,,Thank you for supporting small businesses!

,,,,,Wow. Very good Caribbean roast sandwich. My friend told me this was the best sandwiches he ever had and I'm not gonna lie it's pretty dang good. When I walked in I said my friend told me to come here because it was the best sandwich in Seattle and she corrected me and said in the US.
,,,,,"The onions here kick ass, but omg i dare you to get the corn when its in season. you'll crave it all year. beware."
,,,,,I had big expectations after seeing this restaurant in the top 3 of Yelps top 100 places to eat in 2016. The 3 star rating is basically from being overhyped and probably a place I would've rated 4 stars otherwise. Parking wasn't too bad on the street within a few min walk and the restaurant itself is tiny with maybe 4 tables inside and a couple long table with benches outside. 
,,,,,"Caribbean roast is what everyone recommends and so my gf and I got a sandwich + a plate of it. The sandwich seemed a little lacking in terms of how much meat was on it, and the plate is a much better deal than the sandwich! Sandwich was loaded with grilled onions and some veggies on a ciabatta like roll. "
,,,,,The rice is cooked in pork fat or pork broth which was really tasty and they really load up the pork. Make sure you come hungry if you order a plate! The beets in the salad were really refreshing and it comes with a side of beans and corn as well! The pork had some parts that were pretty tender and some that were over cooked. All in all a very solid meal but anything in the top 10 on yelps 100 should be considered life changing!!
,,,,,Great little spot! They are known for their Caribbean sandwiches which are HUGE. I wouldn't recommend getting take out bc the bread will be a soggy mess by the time you eat it if you do. 
,,,,,"If you are gluten free you have a few options. They have rice and beans, you'll need to get the chicken with no marinade as the rest of the meat has gluten in the marinades. (See below for some more GF options from the owner!! The cashier we had was less knowledgeable so this is helpful info!!)"
,,,,,There isn't a ton of seating but people go pretty quick so you shouldn't have a problem finding a little spot either outside or in their small restaurant.
,,,,,"Hi Emily, we we so glad you had a great visit! Our steak, grilled pork loin, and all of our seafood are gluten free, as well as our chicken breast with no marinade and you can get all of our sandwiches as a lettuce wrap or over rice as a gluten free option! :)"
,,,,,"I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I don't think I'm overselling when I say that. Enjoyed it so much I went twice on my last trip to Seattle.  Looking for a mouthwatering, kinda messy sandwich?  Go. Your belly will thank you. You'll need extra napkins, trust me on this tip. "
,,,,,"Famous Carribean Roast, tender pork shoulder and oh so flavorful."
,,,,,"Roasted Corn, aioli instead of butter?  Who knew corn could tast so good. Just a personal preference, I'd have them go light on the spices they dust on top.  Not spicy, just a bit much, paprika?"
,,,,,"Tostones, dipped in chipotle aioli. Mmmmm, mmmmm good."
,,,,,"Hi Kristi, "
,,,,,Thank you so much for your review! We're so glad you enjoyed your visit to Paseo.
,,,,,The caribbean roast sandwich is amazing. Very very tender pork with perfect seasoning and juiciness. Sandwich is extremely messy so don't eat it in the car like I did lol. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've had. OK service.

,,,,,"This place is nothing compared to un bien, un bien has the true recipe and this place will always be runner up."
,,,,,"I've come here a few times and the experience is always amazing. Out of the two known spots for Caribbean presses: un bien & paseo, this one is my favorite. This little spot serves (and is known for) amazing Cuban press sandwiches, as well as some other great offerings. It's a order at the counter type of spot, but they also have a nice quaint little outside area to sit at with a picnic table setup. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches are always loaded full of caramelized onions and even though it can get a tad greasy and messy, it's very well worth it. The meats are perfectly moist and packed full of flavor while the dashes of jalapenos and sauces make for an artery clogging great time. I'd recommend eating the sandwich immediately when you get it as the bread can get soggy if you let it sit. "
,,,,,"Overall this is a great spot to get a quick bite to eat or even getting some great subs on the go! I'd highly recommend checking this spot out, it's one of those places I take any friends visiting Seattle to!"
,,,,,After living in the greater Seattle area for about 4 years I finally tried this place. Their sandwich was well-filled and quite tasty. Would go back!
,,,,,I finally got the chance to try this place and compare the Caribbean Roast to Un Bien's and it's quite close. The location is small and you must find street parking just like Un Bien. The staff is super friendly too which is great. But the sandwich is slightly different. 
,,,,,"Let me start by saying that Paseo's Caribbean Roast is great! The bread is perfectly toasted and soaks up the delicious morsels of meat that are covered with jalapenos, cilantro, crispy lettuce, and the caramelized onions. But the main difference I noticed is that despite how greasy the wrapper gets, the meat is a bit more dry and the caramelized onions are not as sweet compared to Un Bien's. You can taste the contrast in flavor between sweet and savory at Un Bien that really balances the meal. "
,,,,,"With that said, if you want to introduce a friend to this for the 1st time, I would suggest going out of the way to Un Bien to get them hooked! But if you live closer to Paseo, by all means go here and save the trip! Both taste extremely similar, but Un Bien wins imo."
,,,,,"Excellent flavor,  great portion sizes. I ordered the chicken breast sandwich and the smokin thighs,  both delicious and heavy on the onions and just the right amount of jalapenos to give it a little kick without making it overly spicy."
,,,,,"Excellent flavor,  great portion sizes. I ordered the chicken breast sandwich and the smokin thighs,  both delicious and heavy on the onions and just the right amount of jalapenos to give it a little kick without making it overly spicy."
,,,,,"I really wasn't expecting much out of sandwiches but damn, I was wrong!"
,,,,,Paseo is a really small eatery with only about 3-4 little tables crammed inside. It looks a little run down but don't let this deter you.
,,,,,"I ordered the popular #1 Caribbean Roast ($10.95). Even when you get your order, the sandwich looks pretty ordinary but the flavor burst is absolutely phenomenal. The baguette comes lightly toasted with marinated pulled pork served with the normal fixins of garlic aioli, jalapenos, cilantro and romaine lettuce. Sandwich is served hot and you'll see the steam coming out as you eat. *Warning: can be messy to eat so grab a few extra napkins and a fork."
,,,,,Street parking only but it wasn't tough to find on a weekday for lunch.
,,,,,The Smokin Thighs Sandwich is AMAZING. So flavourful and generous ! ( I always eat it at home because its so messy ) I always get that along with the roasted corn which is bomb!
,,,,,I always order the seared scallop sandwich and it's always good! I used to order the western chicken bowl or whatever it's called but it's been lacking lately.
,,,,,"Way good! If you enjoy the Cuban or Caribbean spices I would recommend this restaurant! My favorite item on their menu is their citrus salad with added pork for the meat, black beans, and corn on the cobb - incredibly satisfying! Very quick and exceptional service."
,,,,,The location in SODO (south of downtown Seattle) has a large parking lot often used for sports event parking. They turned this lot into a drive in movie theatre with Caribbean food. Not sure if the Fremont location does a similar activity.
,,,,,WOW.
,,,,,"I think this is the best sandwich I've ever had. Period. It's such a hole in the wall, the restaurant is small and looks like a shack from the outside."
,,,,,"I'm so glad we didn't have a huge line because the sandwich takes a while to come out. For the price, I'd say it's worth it. Around $11.35 I want to say? Don't remember, just remember the delicious pork."
,,,,,"I got the popular Caribbean Roast and I have to say it was even more Han the hype for me. The bread is a little tougher but I appreciated how it attempted to hold together such juicy meat. Even though it's a messy sandwich, it's a delightful experience."
,,,,,"The pork is so good. I'm still missing it. The caramelized onions are in beautifully big pieces that have a nice pineapple flavor. Surprisingly the romaine lettuce worked even though I don't like lettuce in general. In its simplicity, this sandwich is wonderfully hardy and satisfying."
,,,,,"Would return and recommend to friends. And usually I'm a ""try once and move on"" type of person, but this place is too good."
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,This will forever be my favorite place for a Caribbean sandwich!!! 
,,,,,"The #1 Caribbean roast is what I usually order and every time it keeps me coming back for more. I usually come here when I'm really hungry and because I know what I love I haven't tried much of the other items, but I think I'll have to pretty soon if I end up leaving Seattle again."
,,,,,Hi Abigail!! 
,,,,,We're so glad you love our sandwiches!! Our Caribbean Roast  is definitely a good one! The #2 Press sandwich is a great one to try next if you like the Caribbean Roast :)
,,,,,"This was our first meal after we landed in Seattle, so we were pretty hangry and wanted a delicious, filling meal. Paseo Caribbean is known for their unique sandwiches, filled with pork, chicken, or seafood. The restaurant is actually tiny - basically a counter where you order and a couple tables. There's also some seating outside if you're lucky to snag a seat."
,,,,,"I ordered the renowned Caribbean Roast, which comes with roasted pulled pork shoulder, aioli, cilantro, romaine, jalapeños, & caramelized onions. One bite and I was hooked! The pulled pork was super tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sandwich was stuffed with caramelized onions, which added to the umami flavor of the sandwich. I also enjoyed the aioli, which had a pretty strong garlic taste. The jalapenos added a punch to the already flavorful sandwich. The only bad thing about this sandwich is that it's extremely messy. Probably the messiest sandwich I've ever eaten. A few bites in, and it was dripping all over, but so so worth it!"
,,,,,"Service was super fast too. This was a great first meal in Seattle, and we left with happy tummies. Can't wait to come back in the future!"
,,,,,I had my first Paseo sandwich last week. It was best sandwich I've ever had!  Can't wait to try more.
,,,,,I gave a low review 8 months ago. Someone from Paseo replied asking if I would like to try the sandwich again but I never heard back.
,,,,,"Hi Josh, we’re sorry about this! Can you let us know where you reached out to us so we can get back to you on this? We would love to respond back but have not seen an email, they do get missed sometimes. Thank you for making us aware of this! Our direct email is "
,,,,,"Expectations passed! 10/10 would recommend!! One sandwich is just not enough, you're gunna wanna order two! Service was fast, friendly workers, bombass food! Simple sandwich with a lot of flavor!"
,,,,,Thanks so much for your review Kyle! We're so glad you enjoyed your visit!
,,,,,They could have a better system for callingfor orders.  Person up front was helpful in helping mute decide what to order.  I'm waiting on my order number to be called #13 and I see some dude pop up and grab his order.  I was confused because I ordered before him...I don't think about there was a rush of people after I ordered.  So I'm waiting and waiting for my food until this dude wats more thank half his sandwich before he realizes he had someone else's order -MINE.  
,,,,,"Dude, I orders tofu and tostones NOT a chicken sandwich and fries WTF do people zone out when they eat or what?  And he shared with a girl."
,,,,,When my prefer was remade I got a sorry (it was cool to be acknowledged).
,,,,,My tofu supreme sandwich was okay.  Really greasy - I mean greasy and I got gross instead of the tostones which is what I really bad a taste for.  The bread on the sandwich was nice - roasted with a crunch (yum)
,,,,,I can't say I'd make it back her - it might work for you...it works for many others.
,,,,,Finally got to try this spot after hearing about it from my annoying coworker for years (sorry Jeff lol). It's a little bit on the dirty/greasy side but you know that's just how bomb food goes. I went with the PASEO PRESS but had a bite of my friends CARIBBEAN ROAST and both of them were super good.
,,,,,"It was raining cats and dogs when we were here too so we ended up sharing a plate of CARIBBEAN SCALLOPS over rice and let me tell you, there's nothing like eating warm, saucy scallops over rice on a rainy ass day. We ended up coming back just to share another one of these later on in the trip lol, somehow I liked it even more than the sandwiches."
,,,,,"This place is amazing! Their sandwiches are some of the best in Seattle and I will continue to go back. I would suggest picking up your sandwich personally as some delivery apps take some time and once the sandwich gets cold, it's just not the same as when it's fresh."
,,,,,I believe pork is supposed to be cooked? Received a hunk of completely raw meat in our delivery order. 
,,,,,Red sauce cod was completely flavorless. Tostones and sandwich were decent.
,,,,,Dangerously delicious.  Hard to get them on the phone but really quick if you just drop by and make a order.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,AMAZING! One of the best things I ate on a short trip to Seattle. 
,,,,,Parking can be a little rough-but it's worth it for the sandwiches!! 
,,,,,"We got the press and the Caribbean roast and I honestly don't know which one I liked better because they were both so good! The pork is so juicy and flavorful and the bread is perfectly crunchy yet soft at the same time. The sand which got pretty messy, but I didn't even care because it was so delicious! "
,,,,,"If you're ever in Seattle, this is a must try! Definitely will be back!"
,,,,,A legendary restaurant in Seattle that has completely earned its reputation. 
,,,,,Would give it 10 stars if possible.
,,,,,I'm so disappointed. I ordered a tofu sandwich for delivery and I got steak. It even says tofu on the receipt. My husband is happy with his chicken at least.
,,,,,"We got Paseo delivered and I was a little let down. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, the portion size is huge, and the flavors were great. Unfortunately, it was mostly meat and bread with just some scant toppings and less sauce than such a generous sandwich called for. "
,,,,,"I would order again in person, and maybe ask for more sauce. I wouldn't order Paseo through Peach again, though."
,,,,,"It's awesome!!! Sometimes it's busy, but it's great every time. I recommend the paseo press."
,,,,,"This was my last food stop after a week long vacation in Seattle and the hype did not live up. The #1 Caribbean Roast is far from the best sandwich in America. The bread was chewy and hardly toasted. The pork itself was sparse and almost entirely masked by the caramelized onions. The overall flavor profile is just that of the onions itself as if the pork is a bystander and you get the occasional spice from the jalapeno. The #6 Sauteed Prawns fared better in nearly all aspects but again they skimped out on the key ingredients which make it difficult to justify the cost. A Yelp check-in gets you $1 off their ""famous"" roasted corn appetizer but I would recommend you skip item. Whoever is picking their produce isn't doing a great job; the corn is bland and the toppings can't hide that."
,,,,,"Other reviews mentioned new ownership and it shows. It's a tourist trap now and I guess I fell for it, oops. Staff was friendly but perhaps understaffed, you're going to have to bus your own tables before and after eating. Additionally, parking is practically non-existent and visitors should be prepared to easily 20 minutes driving around the tight neighborhood lanes."
,,,,,"Came in here expecting bomb sandwiches and got exactly what I needed: enormous, delicious, and savory food!  What I didn't expect was the ""Customer Appreciation Raffle"" they were holding...80% off!!!  Two sandwiches, a salad, and a Jarritos for $8.50!!!  This place just won a lifelong customer."
,,,,,The food is mouth-wateringly good here. Whenever I drive by and smell Paseo I have to stop for a sandwich.
,,,,,I understand now.
,,,,,"Yelp wants me to write more, though those three words should be enough. You've come to Seattle, or you've lived here a long time, and you've heard about Paseo and The Sandwich. You've thought to yourself: come on. It can't be that good, can it?"
,,,,,It can.
,,,,,"Go to Paseo. You'll have to mask up and get it to go, of course, but that's fine. You'll probably want to eat The Sandwich in private, because it's going to get all over your hands, and you're going to lick your hands as you eat. There's no shame in doing this, because wiping all that juice and oil on a napkin is a sad, shameful waste."
,,,,,"Order the Caribbean Roast. Eat it, and you, too, will understand."
,,,,,"Here's how we improve:I want to see more seating! Less flies inside, cleaner presentation ( less messy sandwiches when you open the paper, I'd like to see a tiny price adjustment or request a slightly bigger portion on some of the meals. "
,,,,,Here's what is great: the flavor! The quality of food! All the things that actually matter are present! I think this spot is well worth the drive for me. 
,,,,,It would be nice if they also added a punch card.
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,So good. And customer appreciation week was AMAZING! I have told all my friends about Paseo and even went here 3x in 1 week. Definitely get the Caribbean Roast
,,,,,"Overall: Delicious sandwiches, but a bit over-hyped and overpriced"
,,,,,"The good: A dang good sandwich. Piled high with juicy meat and toppings, you really can't go wrong with the original pork sandwich. Every bite was flavorful and covered in goodness (which certainly created a mess when eating, which is a good sign). The fire roasted corn was delicious as well and smothered with cheese, spices, and surely butter. Yum. "
,,,,,The not-so-good: A hole-in-the-wall joint shouldn't cost as much as it does. $11 for a sandwich is too high unless you're getting waited on. Same goes for the $5 side of corn. Not a ton of seating if you're looking to eat right away
,,,,,Food/drink: 8.5/10
,,,,,Service: 8.5/10
,,,,,Atmosphere: 8/10
,,,,,"I was excited to try a sandwich from Paseo's, but it was honestly one of the worst sandwiches I've had. It was bread, a ton of their aioli sauce and huge onions. The aioli was spicy, but had no flavor. The shrimp wasn't marinated and also had no flavor. Everything just slid out of the bread. For the high cost, it was a complete disappointment. I wish I could write something better, but I was not impressed."
,,,,,Delicious and perfect sandwiches for every occasion. Even their vegetarian tofu sandwiches are full of flavor and satisfying textures.
,,,,,Fantastic sando! These things are HUGE! We got the Caribbean Roast and the Paseo Press. Both were great - pork was super juicy and flavorful. Banana peppers and the cilantro added some great flavors. Would definitely go back again.
,,,,,My favorite take out in Seattle! Cod sandwich and the seasoned fries ... the best! Plantains are good too. Won't be disappointed!
,,,,,"Pulled pork was delicious, succulent moist and flavorful. roast corn was delicious. rice and beans were also good, beans tasty but a little to watery for what id prefer."
,,,,,"Three stars because the service experience was bad. People before me and after me picking up all had problems with their order not being fulfilled correctly. I placed order online for scheduled pickup 45 minutes later, when I arrived they said it would be another 15 - 20 minutes later because they ran out of supplies. no phone call or email alert. no attempt at simple apology made. when I got my order 15 minutes later it was incomplete so I had to go back into the restaurant and wait another 5 minutes to get the missing item. complicated process for an easy pickup order. Surprising."

,,,,,This isn't a review for the classic Cuban sandwich. I have had the sautéed shrimp and chicken breast sandwiches. The chicken one is okay (I found it a bit bland for my taste) but I loved the shrimp that comes in mild medium spicy.
,,,,,I've been meaning to come here since I moved to Seattle a couple years ago. This is a cute little hole-in-the-wall that serves up some delicious sandwiches. I got me a prawn sandwich with all the fixings and its delicious! They have a real kick so if you can't handle too much heat I would definitely go with a level 2.
,,,,,"Paseo has been on my yelp bucket list for quite some time. My friend was craving a warm sandwich so we decided to come here. Best decision ever. The sandwich was amazing and the corn was yummy as well!! The sandwich was extremely messy though and we could each only eat half. We took the other half home, but I think the bread will get to be too soggy so maybe split a sandwich with someone when you come because I'm not sure if leftovers will keep "

,,,,,Fantastic sandwiches! Strongly recommend the #1 fantastic pork on a yummy roll. The onion sandwich with 2star spice level was a bit more than expected in the heat side of spice but very yummy!

,,,,,"Great choice, always tasty. Used to be a Seattle secret, now an institution. The tofu con gusto is not quite so good as in the park past, but everything else"
,,,,,"Ok, the hype is real. I am always cautious of going to places that have thousands of reviews because they're tourist traps. I have high hopes then the food falls flat but this was not the case here."
,,,,,"This is a hole in the wall sandwich joint that makes hearty, messy, delicious sammies. I ordered the Caribbean pork roast sandwich since it was listed as ""Rated best sandwich in america"". I don't know if it is really the best sandwich in america but I sure as hell can't think of a better sandwich I've eaten. The sandwich was so simple -- pork roast, romaine lettuce, caramelized onions and jalapenos but so full of flavors I can't even begin to describe. Equally as delicious was the  W. Caribbean bowl with chicken thigh. "
,,,,,I came back the next day and flew out with sandwiches in hand because they were juuuuust that good.
,,,,,"Provender: the Caribbean Roast sandwich was awesome. It's marinated pork, with jalapenos, carmelized onions, special sauce, and lettuce on a crispy baguette. The sandwich is large enough to feed two, or one hungry hippo. For beverages, they serve various jarritos sodas, like pineapple, and beer. They also serve roasted corn, elote style."
,,,,,Prices: the sandwiches are in the $10 range.
,,,,,Parking: there's street parking.
,,,,,"People: all sorts. Hippies, hipsters, kids, and adults."
,,,,,"Perks: there's limited seating inside, but they also have tables outside. On a nice day, sitting outside ain't too shabby underneath the trees. The inside is a bit warmer though. And the workers . . . they have the hottest workers in all of Fremont."
,,,,,"Eating here was so memorable because it was SO delicious. The roasted corn was perfectly salty and sweet, probably the best roasted corn I've ever had. Both of our sandwiches was so savory and filling. Definitely come here on an empty stomach and it'll completely satisfy you. I'd recommend everyone to go out of their way to try this place out, you won't be disappointed!!"
,,,,,"The food is great, and mostly POC-staffed (not sure about the ownership). I found their apparently famous #1 sandwich to be *way* too sweet, and not spicy enough, but otherwise tasty. The bowls are great. "
,,,,,"Now, their jambalaya is absolutely nothing like the Louisiana Creole jambalaya that I'm used to ... but wow, excellent and super-fresh! They offer 1-5 spiciness with added habanero chiles; I ordered 5 and it was medium-spicy but *delicious* and well balanced. If you like your food spicy, you might have to go off their chart with a 6 or 7, or ask for extra chiles. "
,,,,,"My only disappointment is that I probably won't try anything else on the menu, now that I've had the jambalaya. "
,,,,,Gracias al equipo y cocina de Paseo.
,,,,,"Yeah I think I'll PASSeo because I was not very impressed. I was really excited to come here because the hype was big time. Sandwiches looked amazing and authentic! Overall, I'd give the food a 4 (barely) but I'd give the service a 2...  2.5 overall."
,,,,,It's very small inside. A couple benches outside though so that helps. Doors and front windows are wide open so zero cool air on a hot summer day. You can see into the kitchen and it's pretty dirty. Does not look sanitary. 
,,,,,"I got the famous Caribbean roast sandwich and a side of the corn. Corn was pretty good with a lot of good spice and flavor. $5 dollars for like 5 calories though. Not much on cob. The sandwich was good but very hard to eat with the big, thick, and slippery caramelized onions. Yummy bread and roast though! Sandwich was put together really terribly."
,,,,,They have water that is nice and warm... not a fan of that when you're in a hot humid restaurant. The employee taking orders was zero help. Also just yelled out order numbers and when you came up to get your order they didn't know which one was which. Everyone I was with had the same problem.
,,,,,Needless to say I was disappointed and have learned not to give in to the hype too much.
,,,,,"Paseo's lives up to the hype. Simply put, they have some of the best sandwiches I've had in all of Seattle. I have tried the Chicken Thigh Sandwich and the Caribbean Roast Sandwich. The sandwiches are a bit greasy, but worth the mess. Let those greasy bois slide down your gullet to get a taste of perfection."
,,,,,"In addition, the churros are bomb. They have some sort of cream filling and come with a chocolate dipping sauce. They aren't on the menu, but ask about them if you go; I think they're only available during happy hour?"
,,,,,I'd definitely recommend Paseos. I will for sure be returning.
,,,,,"I've been to paseo several times now and I can confidently say they never disappoint. Ive gotten the chicken breast sandwich and I make sure to ask to get it spicy (jalapeños are doubled). The tangy flavors of the marinade with the spicyness of the jalapeños, I just cannot get enough of. The Caribbean fries are delicious alongside the garlic aioli. The roasted corn is so good too with the spices and garlic aioli. If you're considering going, just do it. You won't be disappointed."
,,,,,Order online to pick up to avoid a long wait. This is a great fast casual place in Seattle but if you don't order ahead your will wait awhile. 
,,,,,All ingredients are fresh and tasty. The sandwiches are good but be ready for a mess. You can order extra sauce if you like things very saucy. You don't need it though. Be sure to grab lots of napkins. 
,,,,,The plates are great too if you want to avoid getting your hands dirty. The beans should not be missed and the fish is great and fresh. If you can't handle spice be sure to have the rice with it.
,,,,,"Of course their sandwiches are number one! The classic is amazing with chewy bread, savory sauce, and flavorful meat! The take out process was easy and organized as well. I highly recommend!"

,,,,,"Paseo lives up to the hype as the best sandwich in the US. I was skeptical at first, but their sandwich is truly the best one I've tasted so far in my life."
,,,,,"Caribbean Roast ($10.95) - Marinated & Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder, Fresh Cilantro, Pickled Jalapenos, Caramelized Onions & Crisp Romaine. This is their uber popular sandwich that's consistently won the title as ""best sandwich in America."" The pork's amazing, the bread's perfect, the toppings fit right in = perfection. There's nothing I could complain about the Caribbean Roast, it's quite the messy masterpiece."
,,,,,"Havana Seared Scallops ($10.95) - Sea Scallops pan seared in extra virgin olive oil, Garlic Tapenade, Cilantro. This is also delicious, the scallops're pretty big & they're quite generous with them! The sauce & toppings're the perfect compliment to the scallops."
,,,,,"Paseo is just 1 of those places that you have to try at least once in your life! The seating's super limited inside and outside, but make sure to find a way to eat them there. You can't take them to-go as they'd get too soggy by then. Do be careful with the Caribbean Roast, this sandwich's super messy with juice consistently overflowing out of it."
,,,,,"The Caribbean roast is so amazingly good; it might be the best sandwich I've ever had. The slow roasted pork shoulder is the star of the show; it is perfectly marinated, roasted to perfection. It melts in your mouth in a wonderful melange of meaty fatty goodness. It's complemented by nice caramelized onions and jalapenos to add some kick. I don't usually like jalapenos with my sandwich, but they added just the right amount of spice! The toasted baguette was also super crispy; along with the vegetables, it balanced out the richness of the pork. "
,,,,,"Be warned: this sandwich is super messy, so be careful eating it. Grab lots of napkins."
,,,,,Seating is limited; place is pretty small. I would 100% come back and try more. What an amazing find!!
,,,,,Get the Caribbean roast (#1).  So good and so worth it!   It comes loaded with a lot of pork and all of it was so juicy and tender.  The flavor was really spot on.  It came with a heaping amount of caramelized onions that paired well with the pork.
,,,,,We ended up taking the sandwich to-go and went to a brewery after.  The sandwich paired perfectly with the beer ;) . 
,,,,,"I had to dock a star because although the food is good, the service here is quite horrendous.  The servers aren't enthusiastic, don't really seem to care, and are super slow.  As I was waiting, I saw a bunch of sandwiches on the counter ready to be taken to the customers but no one bothered to do anything.  When someone finally did something about it, my sandwich was actually one of the unlucky ones just sitting there.  Not great as I'm not looking for a soggy sandwich."
,,,,,"I'm unfortunately not a fan despite the many high ratings. I got the #1 and it was just too soggy for me. Maybe next time I'll eat there. The togo wrap didn't help. Expensive too, wouldn't come back on my own time. Street parking only."
,,,,,"Amazing sandwiches (even vegetarian!) if you're a fan of big slices of grilled onions, Paseo will be heaven for you."
,,,,,"This is actually the best, most scrumptious sandwich in the city. I can't say much else, but the food is bomb and the service is thoughtful and kind. I always try to take visiting friends here because this place does not disappoint."
,,,,,"I'm happy to announce that Paseo is just as good as it was when I first had it 6 years ago. I appreciate this consistency since I was raving about their sandwiches to my BF for a while, and the last thing I wanted was them falling short of our expectations. "
,,,,,"But just like last time, the #1 Famous Carribean Roast ($10.50) was hot fire! It was huge - perfect for sharing - and gave off flavor explosions from the first to the very last bite. The marinated pork shoulder was tender and did most of the work though I can't forget about crediting the sauce and the rest of the fixings like the roasted onions. Oh, and the bread, maintained its crunchy chewy texture despite us lugging around the sandwich all the way to Gas Works Park to enjoy it with a view! I honestly don't know how we were able to hold our tummies until then but once we arrived, we devoured the sandwich down to its last scraps within minutes. Our tummies satisfied and at a good fullness once we finished. "
,,,,,My only reservation is that the sandwichs is hella oily (which explains the fullness haha)... so oily that it drenches the 3 pieces of paper it's wrapped in. But they're aware of this and thankfully provide a remedy - wet wipes - so make sure to pick up some of those on your way out! 
,,,,,"Service is okay, nothing to rave about, but at least they're mighty quick! Lucky for me, this time around I didn't have to wait in a line as it was late afternoon, though I don't know if I can say the same during lunch time. Either way, I'll find time once again to visit Paseo when I'm around Seattle the next time around!"
,,,,,"We had a short window for lunch so I called ahead and placed an order for #1 - Caribbean Roast sandwich. When we arrived 15 minutes later, the sandwich was packed and ready to go. It turned out that we could've ordered when we got there as there was no line at all at 12:45pm on a warm Sunday afternoon."
,,,,,"We found seats inside and devoured the sandwich. It was juicy, rich, and all around delicious! Since we were not that hungry, we shared one sandwich and that turned out to be the perfect amount!"
,,,,,Sloppy soggy sandwiches overladen with onions.  Not sure what the hype is about. Ordered the scallop special and they forgot the scallops. Had to drive back to get a replacement and offered a drink for trouble.

,,,,,3.25/5
,,,,,Came by with a group of friends on a Thursday late afternoon after having had this place bookmarked for years and was so excited to finally give it a shot. Parking in the area isn't great but we got a street spot. Luckily not much wait for the food though we had to wait for a cramped table.
,,,,,I ordered their most popular Caribbean Roast sandwich (though really I was eyeing that scallop one). Broke it open and took a bite and it was underwhelming to say the least. The best part is definitely the caramelized onions that they got nice and sweet with a bit of char for extra flavor bursts. The aioli was good but it needed more of it. Bread was fine. Slightly toasted but it's a typical baguette. The big disappointment was the meat. It wasn't dry but definitely not moist either. Flavorwise it had some seasoning but was still kind of lacking. I also got very few pieces of fat. Mostly just dry-ish lean meat.
,,,,,"Overall my visit here was just fine. It wasn't the most expensive sandwich, parking wasn't too bad, we got a seat, and we didn't have to wait in line much but the sandwich was just mediocre. I'm hoping it was just an off day cause looking at photos from other people still makes my mouth water but mine just can't compare."
,,,,,"I was shooooook by the exploding flavor of their tofu sandwich! It was explosive and messy, but worth every bite. The flavor was amazing & the bread they use was just CHEF's KISS! I drank a mango jarritos with it. The fries are bomb too and that SAUCE on the side.. I loooove sauce and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Will definitely be back :)"
,,,,,"A staple Caribbean sandwich of Seattle. It's worth the line. I don't get Paseo very often, but every time I do it's absolutely worth it and it's a treat that satisfies. The roast pork is where it's at - prawns were fantastic too."
,,,,,"Just the best flavors in town. Great sandwiches, beans, piles of pork or chicken. Love it!"
,,,,,"Consistently good food - wonderful flavors, large portions. It's a regular on our restaurant rotation. Even their tofu dish is flavorful!"
,,,,,It's taken me two years to finally try this place. I find myself disappointed for not coming by earlier but excited to return to try more off the menu.
,,,,,"I had the Caribbean Roast sandwich, Paseo jambalaya, and Caribbean fries. Let's start with the sandwich:"
,,,,,"I don't think I have anything to add. Like others have said, this is a must."
,,,,,"Jambalaya: covid-takeout edition--I was really disappointed by the packaging. The use of compostable takeout boxes for something like jambalaya creates a wet bag with the box soaking up the delicious juices. It looked horrible, but immediately all was forgiven when I had a bite."
,,,,,"Caribbean fries: similarly unappealing. The fries looked bland and boring but they are actually flavorful, especially with the garlic aioli."
,,,,,If I could provide some feedback for Paseo: please invest is better packaging for the jambalaya!
,,,,,Thank you for review and your feedback Jamie! We will share this with the kitchen manager and look into it. We’re glad you enjoyed your visit & hope to see you back soon!
,,,,,"Oh. My. Gosh. Everything we ate was delicious! We ordered the Caribbean Pork, the Havana Seared Scallops, and the Cuban Roast. Loved all of the sides and sauces and the staff was friendly and super COVID safe as well. They're open late and on my way home from work, so I'll be a frequent flyer for sure"
,,,,,"When I heard about people raving on how this place had the best Seattle's sandwiches, I had to come try it out and I couldn't agree with them more! "
,,,,,I got the famous Caribbean roast and it was SO amazing! The meat was so juicy and tender and the entire sandwich was packed with flavor! I also got the famous roasted corn and it was slathered with so much butter! YUM!
,,,,,"TIP: definitely go early because the line can go way out the door! It's also a pretty small place, so I recommend grabbing your sandwiches and going to Gas Works Park to eat and enjoy the nice Seattle skyline!"
,,,,,"These sandwiches are the juiciest, sauciest, meatiest, spiciest, and most scrumptious you will have for a long long time!!!! The fries are full of flavor and cooked to perfection. I have NO complaints. I think about my sandwich that I had 7 months ago very often and can't wait to go back when I am nearby! Also the sandos are HUGE so go in with an appetite ;)"
,,,,,Best sandwich I've ever had. Try the fried plantains also! Easy in and out parking loc

,,,,,"Hey, you! If you're reading this and have the time you need to go to Paseo's in Fremont. We ordered the Caribbean Roast, Paseo Press, and the Caribbean Roast Nachos. All three were very good and tasty meals, but the Caribbean Roast is what they are know /famous for and for good reason. Everything about it tied tied together well, from the seasoned pulled pork to the garlic aioli, and lettuce adding that hint of freshness. The bread was also nice and toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall, just a solid sandwich and it was prepared so quickly even with a line out the door. This is a must go for anyone in Seattle, even with Covid they have good safety measures and are only takeout right now."
,,,,,My brother was visiting from out of state and he wanted to go here after seeing that they were rated a #1 sandwich. We were not disappointed! Delicious sammies and fries that we ate on the drive home- they smelled too good to wait. Definitely check this place out! Great grab&go for Gas Works or Golden Gardens.
,,,,,"Not being a native Seattlelite, this was one of the places recommended to me as a ""must-try"" shortly after I moved. I feel obliged to mention that I have not tried Un Bien, so this is a blind taste test of sorts as far as this type of cuisine goes. I ordered three things via their online ordering system: the Press sandwich, calamari (happy hour special), and the roasted corn. "
,,,,,"The corn is basically elote, or Mexican street corn (though with cilantro, which I don't usually see elote), if you've had that before. Otherwise it's basically a very unhealthy corn on the cob. I spent a while thinking about why their corn seemed a little lacking and then it occurred to me that it's probably because there's no strong citrus flavour and it's not even remotely spicy; chili powder and lime on the side are usually main components of elote. This was probably compounded by the fact that getting it to-go meant it was wrapped up in foil, and a lot of the smearing on the corn came off (and couldn't really be put back on very easily). So while it tasted good, it wasn't strong enough in my opinion.  "
,,,,,"The menu says that the calamari comes with both a garlic aioli and a red sauce, but I definitely didn't get the aioli. It's a shame because I think I would have liked that a lot more than the red sauce, which was some kind of cocktail-ish sauce that I really did not like at all. The squid is cooked well, but texturally maybe a little soft on the outside; it's not the traditional deep-fried really (like at a seafood restaurant or something) if that's what you're expecting - lightly breaded is more like it. I've literally never ordered calamari at a Caribbean restaurant though, and I somewhat doubt that this is what people come here for. "
,,,,,"Onto the most important part, the sandwich! I am not a sandwich aficionado, but I have had some really amazing sandwiches over the years from all kinds of places. I thought that the Press was a solid maybe 8/10 sandwich, but it's not a top-tier sandwich. The pros first. The pork is a hefty portion, though I agree that some parts seem drier than other parts like some other people comment on. I'm a big fan of their giant caramelized onions; it keeps things from spilling out. The bread is really robust and holds up well. The cons. The Swiss cheese was very weak in my opinion; you could have told me they were using something mild like provolone or even white American and I would have believed it. I think that two cheese layers, one on top of the pork and one below, would have been better. But I realize that some people might think that was too close to a cheeseburger level. The banana peppers were good but perhaps a little sparse; I didn't always get one in every bite. The sandwich is tall, but because the bread holds up fairly well, it can take a bit of an unhinging to get it into your mouth. The price is maybe a tad high; I'm not used to paying the same for a non-steak meat as for seafood or steak (which is the case here). But you pay for name brand here like anything else famous. "
,,,,,"Parking is probably the biggest issue, which isn't their fault. On busier times or days, you may have to hunt around the local neighborhood, although if you order online and just need to run in to get your order, you can probably chance a 60-second dash from a restricted zone or even a driveway. Their COVID measures are pretty standard and include waiting outside after you order; I recommend just ordering online - they were on time with my order at 5:15 on a Friday."
,,,,,"Wow. No words. This most certainly lived up to the hype. Got the famous Caribbean sandwich and everything about it was great. Not too heavy, great bread, a little spicy. Would come back to Seattle just for the sandwich."
,,,,,"We ordered pick up from Paseo after hearing rave reviews. Heard this was the best sandwich of all time! I was really disappointed with what was served to us. We got a sandwich to-go and the sandwich was so sloppily put together. Not only that, but there was no consistency with the onions. A good portion of the onions were really burnt. "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Honestly, I'm really disappointed based on the hype. I know it's covid-19 so I don't like to leave bad reviews, but i hope the quality really improves."
,,,,,One of the best sandwich spots in Seattle! 
,,,,,Food: 5/5 Super good food for a really good price.
,,,,,"- Caribbean Roast Sandwich ($10.95) This sandwich is so freaking good! The bread is nice and soft and holds up to the sauce and fillings. The meat is super tender and juicy (a little bit on the fatty side, but that's a positive lol) but for me, the best part of the sandwich are the marinated onions. They literally have an option to order more onions on the side, they are that good!"
,,,,,"- Roasted Corn ($5.00) Roast corn with butter, garlic, and cheese? Can't get any better than that."
,,,,,- Caribbean Fries ($5.00) Crispy fries with a tasty cajun seasoning all over with a nice cooling garlic aioli as a dip. 
,,,,,"Service: 3.5/5 Don't get me wrong, everybody here is really nice. I think the only negative is how busy this place can get and the line can be pretty long. The actual indoor eating area can get super congested so I definitely recommend eating outside if it is sunny. If it is rainy then take it to go or try and grab a table. "
,,,,,"Parking: 4/5 Pretty easy to find parking somewhat close, but you might have to walk a little bit."
,,,,,"Overall, great spot for locals and tourists alike! The sandwiches are fire and going during the summer is the best time to go!"
,,,,,"Hi Alex! Thank you so much for visiting & leaving a review! If you're looking for more sitting space on your next visit, our SoDo location has a full dining room and bar with lots of seating space. We are so glad to hear you enjoyed your meal, thank you for your review & we hope to see you back soon!"
,,,,,Not sure what happened :( 
,,,,,Paseo's was the best and now it's not. It might've had to do with their closing and reopening but not sure. Maybe it was karma?
,,,,,"We tried it since it reopened a few times now and it has fallen short. The once beloved Caribbean sandwich was either flavorless, dry, and this last time overly sweet. "
,,,,,Please bring back your original recipe.
,,,,,"Mmm, Cuban sandwich...."
,,,,,"Call ahead to make sure they haven't run out. Cuban roast pork is where it's at. Eat it, wear it, put your face in it."
,,,,,This place is excellent. The big gap is with their bread. Whenever you bite a sandwich everything comes spilling out and makes a huge mess. You have to build the sandwich in you're mouth by picking out each part after the first bite.
,,,,,"Get proper cuban bread, wrap it in foil, and hit it with a press."
,,,,,"You're going to overeat getting the tostones, but definitely worth it."
,,,,,"You know what, the service is dry as fuck BUT the food is delicious and it's worth it. "
,,,,,"P.S. please try the sautéed prawns sandwich, 4 for the level of spice :d"
,,,,,The Caribbean sandwich was amazing. Worth the hype. The bread was perfectly crunchy and the meat and garlic aioli were so flavorful. Such a fun little spot to go to for lunch. A must try.
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,These sandwiches are exceptionally tasty. We could not stop thinking about them throughout our entire weekend in Seattle!
,,,,,Not as good as Un bien and I always find the meat a little dry. But it's still a pretty good sandwich and would stop by if you're in the area.
,,,,,"Fantastic sandwiches and great staff.  Their pork is the way to go, but everything is fairly good.  Fries don't transport well if you are thinking of taking to go"
,,,,,"The pork sandwich is 5 stars, it was really good.  "
,,,,,"The seating options are cramped and not laid out very well.  The line to order is slow.  I don't get what takes so long to get orders in, but whatever."
,,,,,"I was planning to go here during my trip, but got lucky and found a groupon to use, so ended up getting more food than I had planned on."
,,,,,"I got an order of tostones which were decent, but I would definitely skip those next time.  Stick with the sandwich."
,,,,,TLDR; get the Famous Caribbean Roast! It's a pretty filling sandwich so come with an appetite. 
,,,,,"This small shop serves some of the best sandwiches I've ever had, specifically their Caribbean Roast. Come early so you don't have to wait too long, but because it's so small, it can take awhile for your orders if there have been a lot of people ahead of you. There's maybe only 5-6 tables inside the shop. Only street parking is available. "
,,,,,"Each of the sandwiches come with garlic aioli, cilantro, romaine lettuce, caramelized onions, and pickled jalapeños. The baguette was kind of thick but I liked how crispy they toasted it. I split the Steak and Swiss and the Caribbean Roast, with the latter being my favorite. The pork shoulder in the Roast was so tender. The Steak and Swiss was just alright in my opinion. It wasn't a bad sandwich but when I compared it to the Roast, it just kind of fell short, in my opinion. "
,,,,,The Caribbean fries were really good too. Tasted like they sprinkled cajun seasoning over the fries. Make sure you get the garlic aioli to dip! 
,,,,,It was overall a messy meal. Kind of hard to keep everything within the bun but there are forks on the side...or just dig in with your hands and wash them later! Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle.
,,,,,"Do you like giant delicious messy sandwiches? If so, this is a real spot hitter. Both the Caribbean and Cuban roast sandwiches are out of control. Remember to scoop up some napkins, because you'll be covered in delicious sandwich stuffs when you take on these beasts."
,,,,,"This review is about service ONLY. My husband and I ordered using the online ordering system. The system said to pick it up at 7; it's 730 and we are still waiting. The online system allows you to select curbside pickup, but no one answers the phone to actually bring the food curbside. There's also no one stationed at the pick up area, so you have to wait in line to even give your name (only to be told your order isn't ready). There are so many places that have mastered takeout and curbside, but this was a total shitshow. I get that it's Friday and sunny, but this service was so bad and we wound up literally sitting in the car for 30 minutes with no sense of when our food would be ready."
,,,,,"I ordered the famous Caribbean Roast sandwich, which was stacked high with pork shoulder, jalapeños, romaine, and caramelized onions. Seriously this sandwich was huge! I also got the roasted corn, which was also gigantic and paired really well with the sandwich, definitely recommend! This was a super filling and satisfying meal and would definitely come back to try more from their menu!"
,,,,,"Tried this place for the first time last week and I am impressed! Amazing price for the quality and size of food you receive! We got the #1 and it appeared small bc the bread is narrow, but it's actually huge and packed with tons of meat. We also got the tostones, you get like 6-7 in each bag and they're huge. We easily could've split 1 bag amongst 2-3 people! The sandwiches are like $11, I feel like they could charge much more and wouldn't lose any business! Will definitely be back."
,,,,,"The Famous Caribbean Roast is my usual go to and one of the best, if not the best sandwich on the menu. The Rice Bean Trio is simple but packs plenty of flavor and the roasted corn is a great side. I appreciate the size portion of the sandwiches and the amazing flavors."

,,,,,"Been to paseo a couple of years ago, and it was so good I bought another sandwich to take on the road!"
,,,,,"Fast forward to today, and it's still as good as I remembered it! It has a messiness to it that just needs to be there in their sandwich! The sauce sliding down on the corners of every bite, the tender pork breaking off so tenderly, and the soft (but hard) bread that keeps all the good stuff together! "
,,,,,Paseo is still very very tasty.
,,,,,Literally the best sandwich I've ever had. I would come back all day every day for this place. Amazing hole in the wall.
,,,,,"It's a tiny little shop in north Seattle, we happened to be in the area and this place was highly rated so we thought why not. First of all parking is non existent so be prepared to street park somewhere and walk. Second, its a very small little shop with very limited tables. The line may look like it's out the door and crazy, but in reality there's only room for like 10 people to wait in line inside. So after waiting in line maybe 10 min or so we ordered. "
,,,,,"We got the top 2 sandwhiches, Caribbean roast and Paseo Press. Both were incredible. The sandwich had a great balance of flavor for all of its ingredients. I was a fan of the press. I liked how it tasted a little but sweeter but balanced with the banana peppers. We also ordered the corn which was dope because I love garlicky items. I would 100% come back"
,,,,,Thank you Martha! We are so glad you had a great experience at Paseo & loved your sandwiches and corn.
,,,,,"My dad took me here probably 7 years ago, and I still remember how juicy and tasty Paseo's sandwiches were. Their quality has not changed since."
,,,,,"I went with a friend here for dinner after tennis yesterday, and he absolutely loved it. It's kind of a hole in the wall restaurant, so there's limited seating, but we were able to get a table around 5pm. We both got #1 Caribbean Roast sandwiches (the sandwich they deem ""Best sandwich in America""). The Caribbean roast comes with marinated roast pork, jalapeños, grilled onions, lettuce, and their special sauce on a freshly toasted baguette. It is a stack of heaven. They also have a variety of hot sauces; my friend and I particularly liked the Mexican red hot sauce."
,,,,,"I've gotten their rice plate options in the past, but the sandwiches are where it's at! If you love pork and a good sandwich, look no further. Will definitely be back again soon!"
,,,,,"5/5 for food, 5/5 for service, 4/5 for ambiance"
,,,,,Been meaning to stop here for ages and wasn't disappointed! Had their famous Caribbean Roast and so many flavors on so many levels served on a delicious baguette. Perfect...this will be the first of MANY visits!
,,,,,"I got their signature sandwich and the main problem is that while it tastes good, it gets messy and soggy FAST. This was especially an issue for takeaway. This is a pain point for their business because they dont have a lot of seating either. Hopefully this can solve itself as seating options open up!"
,,,,,"A seattle staple, what else can you say? "
,,,,,"The Paseo Press Slaps! Struggling to write this review because I'm slowly entering a blissful food coma. Wow, these sandwiches are savory, spicy, sweet and oh so splendid. The banana peppers, the onions, the jalapeños, all caressing the succulent pork, with juices seeping into the toasted baguette. My my my I'm too content, now all I need is a warm blanket to put me to sleep on this cozy Seattle day. Well done, Paseo. Per usual."
,,,,,Five stars all out max amazing. 
,,,,,"This is the most taste tantalizing food experience.   Please don't eat in public.   This the kind you have to eat in your car and go to town on a sandwich #2 press, super gold corn with more amazing flavors... one bottle of coca cola "
,,,,,#2 press has toast bread roll
,,,,,"Super saucy, caramelizing onions my favorite, fresh delicious cheese i don't know what kind but it works well with this sandwich,  marinated pork and a slice of ham. And a lot of delicious flavors, a lot a lot flavor damn i am frickin amazed.  "
,,,,,"The corn is also a must have.  Roast sweet gold corn, the sauce on top is unmatched from anything i have taste. Good job Paseo Caribbean Kitchen and chef that came up with this recipes thank you so much... i shall come back soon baby!"

,,,,,"They have not upgraded much since my last visit, I love the hole in the wall shack feel."
,,,,,"Parking is still difficult, hit or miss. Located in the out skirts of Seattle, away from the tourist area."
,,,,,"Caribbean Roast Sandwich - $9.95 from $8.50 in 2014 - For someone who choices beef and chicken over pork, this pork is amazing. Roasted perfectly, the marinade gives it such great flavor. Toppings make the pork taste even better. I love the onions. Perfecting between two slices of bread!"
,,,,,GREATEST SANDWICH EVER!!!
,,,,,"I've eaten probably every high rated sandwich place in LA, SF, PHILLY, and NY and nothing compares to this. "
,,,,,"Parking, crap crap and crap! Be prepared to do some illegal stuff looking for parking."
,,,,,Cash only! The restaurant is super small and whole in the wall-ish.
,,,,,"The line is bananas, I saw the line and ordered to go instead. Took 15 minutes and I ate in front of my car looking at the people in line. "
,,,,,Caribbean Roast Sandwich - $8.50 - The flavor was just amazing. The meat and the sauce combined with the toppings. Perfection between bread!!! 
,,,,,Paseo is on the same level as New York's Chicken and Rice at 53rd & 6th Halal Cart. I would come to Seattle just to eat this sandwich!
,,,,,MUST EAT!
,,,,,"THE FAMOUS CARRIBEAN ROAST!  One of the best sandwiches that I have ever had and I don't even really like sandwiches.  Pork was juicy, tender, flavorful and delicious.  The second best part of the sandwich was the perfectly caramelized onions.  I am going to make this place a must visit every time I am in Seattle."

,,,,,"We were in the area and in the mood for a sandwich. Paseo popped up first on the list on Yelp and the reviews are great, so we thought it was worth a try! The service was quick and our cashier was friendly. :-) "
,,,,,"We tried the #1 (Famous Caribbean Roast) and the #6 (Sautéed Prawns). The toasted baguette was amazing and I especially appreciated the cilantro and jalapeño on the sandwiches!! The #1 was just about perfect. No complaints at all. The pork shoulder was juicy and had an impeccable flavor. The #6, however, while it was amazing and the prawns had great flavor, there were way too many onions on the sandwich. They all fell out into the wrapper... I am an onion lover, but I think they could have lowered the amount of onions a significant amount and the sandwich still would have had plenty. "
,,,,,"Anyway, the onions weren't a big deal and it was so good we want to go back and try every sandwich on the menu. Thank you, Paseo. See you soon!!"
,,,,,Wow. Just wow. Hands down the best sandwich ever. I ordered the pork roast sandwich and it was love at first bite. Literally shed a tear of joy when I took a bite of the delicious sandwich. So many flavors greeting your tastebuds at once.
,,,,,Paseo ain't Paseo anymore.  'Nuff said.  
,,,,,Go to Un Bien if you want the real deal...this place now makes sandwiches that are a distant shade of what they once were.
,,,,,"Almost nine years after my first visit, I finally made it back to Paseo. I was with a group of eight, all of us going to a wedding on Orcas Island, and this was the only Seattle stop our car made between the airport and the ferry terminal. Paseo is a popular institution, but it has a second location now, and some time has passed, so no more line out the door, at least not at lunchtime on that particular Friday. We were able to get two tables next to each other without any difficulty."
,,,,,"Service was friendly if a bit on the slow side, understandable given the small size of the operation. I was pretty sad to learn that the scallop sandwich was sold out--I'd been hearing about that sandwich for years and kind of had my heart set on it. Instead, I shared a #1 and a #6 with June K., along with a side of the roasted corn."
,,,,,"Everything was mouthwateringly delicious. I think the #1 is what was once the #2 (see my original review), the famous Caribbean roast with marinated and slow-roasted pork shoulder, fresh cilantro,"
,,,,,"pickled jalapeño, caramelized onions, and crisp romaine. The #6 was the sautéed prawn sandwich: black tiger prawns sautéed in garlic tapenade, also with cilantro, jalapeño, onion, and romaine. I loved both the juicy pork and the snappy, flavorful shrimp. Both sandwiches came on toasted baguette slathered with Paseo's garlic aioli. They were incredibly messy. I used many napkins and still got aioli and other tasty drippings all over my face and hands. The roasted corn on the cob was great too, also slathered in garlic aioli, as well as parmesan, cilantro, and house spices."
,,,,,"I was thrilled to go back to Paseo and look forward to going again, hopefully before another nine years have passed. I may not live in Seattle, but I love this place, and I refuse to die without trying that scallop sandwich."
,,,,,"Just a few minutes after I opened the wrapper and started in on my #2 from Paseo, Matt B. looked at me in disbelief and said, ""You ate that whole thing?""  I nodded, slightly ashamed, while I wiped mayo and pork fat off of my cheeks."
,,,,,"Rewinding.  Paseo is a humble hole in the wall, the most noticeable aspect of which is the throng of people waiting in line or waiting for orders in the street.  I was taking a sandwich to go, so I took a number and waited for my order.  It was a little bit of an ordeal.  You can also eat inside, as there is some seating."
,,,,,"The ordeal, though, was well worth it.  The #2, or the Cuban roast, is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  Made with marinated, slow roasted pork shoulder, fresh cilantro, pickled jalapeños, lettuce, caramelized onions, and a plentiful slather of aioli, it was succulent and flavorful and unbelievably messy.  The pork was juicy, and I doubt that it even needed the help of mayo.  The onions were awesome.  They were caramelized to a wonderful sweetness, but they were cut into huge strips and retained a firm texture.  I put away the whole sandwich with the help of many many napkins and an ever expandable stomach.  When pieces of pork or onion fell out, I picked them up with my hands and put them right in the old gullet.  The sandwich was truly amazing."
,,,,,"Paseo will be a must-stop for me whenever I come through Seattle.  It's not every day that you meet a sandwich of #2's caliber, and when you do, you commit to the long-distance relationship.  I suppose it's for the best that I can only see it every now and then, as it is a heart attack couched in a baguette, but I miss it just the same."
,,,,,I had made my way to Paseo after hitting up the Theo chocolate Factory. Parking is...kinda fun. Street parking on one of the side streets but man some of the streets are small. Anyways headed over and there actually wasn't a line to order (however more of the line was waiting for the food).
,,,,,"I decided and opted for the Carribean Roast sandwich, which is roasted pulled pork shoulder, aioli, cilantro, romaine, jalapenos, and caramelized onions. The wait for it was actually not too long haha and erm... when it came, it was pretty massive. It was pretty long and packed full of meat.. or was it onions? I couldn't tell because the onions were all over as well haha."
,,,,,"The pulled pork was good, went through pretty well and had a lot in it (they did not skimp on this). The aioli wasn't enough to have the complete flavor mask throughout the pulled pork as there was so much. A little bit of an inconsistency here. More jalapenos though please! The base of the bread was different and had a tad of a crunch to it, and had enough bread strength to hold all the fillings together."
,,,,,"Something to try here, big portions that don't skimp. A few seating places inside as well, but feels kinda cramped. Give it a try- I see people have been saying sides are good as well, but I would have been well too full to stuff this and the sides together haha."
,,,,,"I decided to visit after a friend highly recommended it to me. I had two sandwiches and the elite which were both really good. What made it better my meal was actually on the house because it was customer appreciation day. I offered to pay regardless but the staff was so friendly and professional they refused. When I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, I took off my ring and left it there. Unfortunately I didn't realize until after I was already on the flight back to Los Angeles. I called the staff and they were super helpful in getting my ring back to me. Overall great service and great food."
,,,,,Had the Smokin' thighs sandwich and seasoned fries and they were delicious! The aioli and carmelized onions were the stars of the meal for me. Can't recommend this place enough - so good!
,,,,,Omg! Been meaning to try this place for years and finally got the chance while working around the corner. Holy sh*t! One of the best if not the best sandwich I've had in a very long time. Huge portions and quality meat and bread. Also got a side of the garlic aioli because I'm a sauce lover and wow. Amazing! 10/10 recommend
,,,,,"I see a reoccurring theme of ""best"" restaurants that turn out to be nothing worth writing home about, so I'm writing on Yelp. A soggy piece of romaine with caramelized onions (um, greasy, colorless, rushed version of caramelized onions). As a former chef, I'm insulted and took it personally that I was lied to. Okay, I've been to a variety of restaurants that offer Cuban sandwiches and I'll recommend Bongos. El Cubano by Geos at second. Even though the original owners left a while ago, and I had gone there then too, it was a mediocre sandwich that had so much publicity that people had a tendency to be brainwashed first and contrasting reality maybe came in after, if it came in at all."
,,,,,"Finally visited Paseo's this week! This was quite possibly the messiest sandwich I've ever eaten, but it was delicious. Make sure to eat it within the first 30 mins of getting it for best results. Famous roasted corn was indeed worthy of being famous. Go get yourself a porkwich. "
,,,,,Minus a star as the tostones and salad were meh.

,,,,,got the chicken sandwich! the onions were caramelized so nicely and the garlic aioli has many minced veggies in it which I thought was a nice addition to a fairly regular sauce. The chicken was juicy and the jalapeños were a perfect amount of spice!!
,,,,,Very good sandwich. Juicy sweet tasty lip smacking goodness.The bread holds up to all the juiciness.  Literally some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

,,,,,The sandwich is soooo juicy and so lovely 
,,,,,Their service is super good
,,,,,Their pork shoulder flavor is soooo fulfilling 
,,,,,I love it sooooo much
,,,,,"Being a native Seattleite, I have always heard of Paseo and how it's the BEST cuban sandwich in the city. I had high expectations and wow... Paseo exceeded them!! Ordering online was simple and easy on their website, my food was ready in 10-15 minutes. The store was clean and followed distancing guidelines. I noticed a couple benches/tables outside for people to eat at. Street parking was okay at 2pm on a weekday, there are quite a few food pickup load/unload spots on the street."
,,,,,"I ordered the #1 ""the best sandwich ever"" and it was so JUICY and flavorful. The lettuce and pickled jalapeños really elevated the flavor and the bread was able to take on all the juiciness from the pork!! I surprisingly finished the whole thing (it is huge) and I was full for the rest of the day. My partner ordered the Paseo Jambalaya with 5 stars and it was so flavorful! 5 stars was a bit challenging for me to eat, I personally prefer a spice level around 3 stars but the spiciness doesn't overpower the flavor of the dish. I am definitely going to return and try some new things. Paseo is amazing and I highly recommend it. The price is great and affordable for the quality and expertise of food you receive!"
,,,,,Really good place for Caribbean style sandwiches. Grilled pork lion sandwich was very tasty. My favorite is the famous Caribbean roast. The pork shoulder tasted so good.
,,,,,Great experience! The waitress was very sweet and helpful. She suggested the Caribbean Roast as one of their good choices & I'm very happy because it was REALLY GOOD! The meat very tender & the combination with the onion made it even better. There were a couple of tables outside. There are some light fixtures which made it a night to remember! We also got the fries  and the portion was big enough for two very hungry adults. Will definitely come back on my next trip!
,,,,,"This was my first time here, finally stopped in when I realized I was in the right place at the right time. The sandwiches were okay. The service at the counter was a bit brusk and I could tell they were annoyed I paid with cash. Overall, I'd say it was fine."
,,,,,I had to give this place a try on the last day of my Seattle trip because my friend sweared by their sandwiches and says he can still imagine the taste of the sandwich til this day. 
,,,,,"Because it was a small place, I decided to order my sandwich to-go and consume it in the car before our flight. "
,,,,,"I tried the #1 Famous Caribbean Roast and it did not disappoint. It was really flavorful, especially with the caramelized onions. Yum! I'm not sure if it's the best sandwich in America, but it was pretty delicious!"
,,,,,"Hi Mai, thank you for your review! We're so glad you stopped by and enjoyed your Caribbean Roast sandwich :)"
,,,,,"Truly don't understand the stellar reviews. The food was lackluster.... Decent, but nothing special. "
,,,,,"Also, few places to sit and eat."
,,,,,"TLDR: Not as good as OG Paseos, still damn good. "
,,,,,"Paseos used to be a literal tourist attraction back in the days. I remember waiting in line for an hour for that sweet sweet Caribbean roast sandwich. For those of you that don't know, Paseos had some legal issues a few years back that caused the ownership to change or something like that. If you want the OG Paseos, its called Un Bien now and it's like a 5-10 minute drive away. I'm not trying to drive business away from Paseos - it's still awesome! If I'm 5 minutes from Paseos, I'm not going to drive an extra 10 minutes to get Un bien, but if I'm equal distances from both, I'd go with Un bien - you know what I mean?"
,,,,,"Anyways, the sandwich here is fantastic. Super juicy chunks of meat that melt in your mouth. Onions are nice and caramelized and the aioli gives it a nice finish. Definitely give it a shot!"
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,This place is the definition of comfort food.  The Caribbean roast is so tender with generous topping of caramelized onions.  You will be stuffed with one sandwich and some Caribbean fries which comes with a garlic aioli.  The scallop sandwich was also tasty with large well cooked scallops.  Make sure you purchase a Groupon for an awesome deal-  they were super kind to my husband who paid and forgot to use the voucher.  The staff honored the voucher and processed a refund.  After grabbing the food head to Gas Work Park to watch the boats go by and if you have children they will enjoy the playground.
,,,,,"Delicious Cuban sandwiches! My husband and I got the Caribbean Roast and we both loved it! The pulled pork, caramelized onions and jalapenos are so fresh and well cooked that they melt in your mouth!"
,,,,,What's special about the Fremont location is their plantine chips and salsa to die for! Best plantine chips I've had in my life!
,,,,,"If you visit the beautiful Fremont area, take a walk to paseo and enjoy a sandwich+chips & salsa! Bon appetit!"
,,,,,WOW! Huge fan. 
,,,,,I've had Cuban food made for me by my Cuban friends and Paseo delivers the same salty semi-sweet combination! So savory and perfect for a summer lunch.
,,,,,"Order the Caribbean roast sandwich, you won't regret it - as is stated truly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It was flavorful - the pork was so moist and not chewy at all. The bread was the perfect choice for the sandwich and the onions were sweet. The sides - tostones (fried plantains) and Caribbean fries. Both came with dips that were perfect to go alongside them. Rice and beans were also good, my friend and I split our meal and her bowl was top notch. I have nothing bad to say about Paseo. They also had such yummy classic selections for drinks: old school soda bottles! I got the guava fanta of course! One of my favorite things is that the spice isn't over the top. The prices are also great for what you get - nothing absurdly over the top. I can't wait to try more options from Paseo. Be sure to remember your number for your order as they have so many!"
,,,,,I went on their website to order dinner and the include a 15%  tip automatically this is moronic!  I am driving to your restaurant and you are making a sandwich.  Get over yourself paseo. A tip is what I decide not what you dictate!  I will wait till I am back in my home state to get a real Cuban sandwich.
,,,,,"Hi Robert, sorry you feel this way! The 15% tip is what is suggested automatically by the website we go through for online ordering. It also gives you the option to put in a custom tip ($0) upon checkout, you just have to select the “change tip” button. Hope this helps!"
,,,,,Still dreaming about this sandwich for days!!! 
,,,,,"I've heard amazing things about this place but I've been hesitant because I don't really care for sandwiches but I decided to give it a chance and boy was I glad. I got the Caribbean roast and the meat was sooo soft and well marinated. The caramelized onions is a great addition to the sandwich and it plays so well with everything else. I also saw they serve sangria here and if it wasn't 12 in the morning, I'd get a cup. Overall, I'd definitely come back and get the Caribbean roast again!"
,,,,,"Hi Alicia, thank you for your review! We're so glad you came in to try our Caribbean Roast & loved it! We hope to see you back soon, with a glass of sangria too :)"
,,,,,4225 Fremont Ave N
,,,,,"I enjoyed the vegetarian grilled onion sandwich. Very tasty sauce, and spicy jalapeños. Required several napkins, so luckily I ate it outside :) My sister and her husband drove up from Portland to pick up lunch and this was a great choice for a first stop"
,,,,,Of course had to try out the famous Caribbean Pork. The portion size matches the price. There's a hefty amount of meat and it's juicy but too greasy for my taste. The wrapping paper is soaked in oil from the start. It's literally too vertically gifted to fit a whole bite in my mouth. It's inevitable that the meat is gonna be squeezed out and grease is gonna drip everywhere even if you try to eat carefully. The bread is honestly my favorite part as it is warm and crunchy. It certainly is not bad when you're in the mood for some carby fatty comfort food but it's kinda overhyped imo. 
,,,,,Masks are required inside. There are wooden benches outside under shady trees but most people took it to-go. Gotta find street parking.
,,,,,"Love the food just wish I could get it delivered. No one answers the phone. I went through door dash and maybe that's the problem. The complete lack of communication is what is irritating me. Great product poor execution. They either have a "" technical difficulties ""  or some sorry excuse. I gave 4 stars because I did not want to be a dick, but hey pull your head out. Bush league bs"
,,,,,"Turns out it was door dash, they never showed up"
,,,,," My wife reordered today, all is good, sorry for the"
,,,,,The rant.
,,,,,"Wow! I can see why this place is so highly rated.  My boyfriend and I are in Seattle for a visit and working.  I was so depressed to spend my first day of ""vacation"" working in my hotel room. We were starving and wanting lunch. Since I couldn't go out, I found this place on Yelp and they delivered.  It was so good!!!  "
,,,,,"I ordered the Famous Caribbean Roast sandwich and my boyfriend had the Scallop Sandwich.  The Famous Caribbean Roast is melt in your mouth delicious. The flavors are amazing and the jalapeño adds just the right touch of heat. The garlic aioli was fabulous and the scallops were to die for. We may have found our most favorite spot in Seattle. I hope I can get there ""in person"" next time.  We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,"At first, I was like...why am I standing in line for 45 minutes to order a sandwich? And then waiting another 30 minutes for the actual sandwich? But...then I ate it, and it was divine. I highly recommend the Caribbean Roast sandwich. You will not regret it. Also, if you actually plan ahead, you can call your order in ahead and wait half the time."
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to give it a try!
,,,,,"My friend got the classic caribbean roast sandwich and she loved it! The sauce really enhances the flavor of the roasted pork, but the baguette was gigantic so it took us a while to finish it."
,,,,,The scallop sandwich may not be available every time but it's definitely worth getting! Generous portions of the scallops sautéed with basil with a subtle flavor of soy sauce(?) The only downside is the baguette gets really soggy because of all the moisture and sauce that comes with the scallops...but still tasted amazing!
,,,,,Hi Maggie!
,,,,,Thank you for your review! We are so glad you and your friend enjoyed your visit to Paseo! Our Sea Scallops are sautéed in a garlic tapenade with EVOO. 
,,,,,Thank you for coming in and leaving a review! We hope to see you back soon!
,,,,,"Visited Seattle with a couple of friends for a few days and Paseo was the first place we went to for food as soon as we got to the city.  The location is honestly quite great, located in Fremont near various attractions such as the Fremont Troll."
,,,,,"The food itself was very good.  My friend and I got the #1, which is the Famous Caribbean Roast sandwich, and it was by far the best Cuban sandwich I have ever had.  The sandwich had great flavor and the vegetables and meat really complimented each other well without any of the flavors being overpowering.  The meat itself was tender and not dry at all, which is something I have noticed in other Cuban sandwiches I have had."
,,,,,Overall I had a great experience at Paseo and it is definitely somewhere you should make a point to go to if you ever find yourself in Seattle.
,,,,,"The Caribbean Roast:  In my opinion, the best sandwich I've had in my life.  Tender juicy marinated pulled pork, subtly sweet sauteed onions, salty and spicy jalapeno, crispy fresh lettuce, a delicious seasoned mayo spread, and fresh baked artisanal bread.  It's a flavor combination with no match in these United States of America.  If there was a Paseo in Mountlake Terrace, I would eat there every week.  As it is, I must make the trek whenever the mood strikes me, and it's well worth it every time.  Do yourself a favor, and eat this sandwich.  You can thank me later."
,,,,,This is a well deserved title of America's best sandwich.  
,,,,,It's been the better part of a decade since I've eaten it and it's only improved!  The bread isn't as enormous but the sandwich itself still maintains an excellent balance of all ingredients.  
,,,,,"The menu also has vegan options, a variety of seafood choices, and more salad, bowl, sandwich choices than you'd imagine. "
,,,,,I'm grateful this place has maintained its consistency while they've quite literally stripped the houses and trees from all around this quaintly chopped looking stand.  I hardly recognized the area driving up.
,,,,,It's so inspiring I'm currently making a pork roast for dinner to have some kind of repeat tender pork experience.
,,,,,"With nearly 5,000 reviews and multiple recommendations from locals, I had high hopes for Paseo! Unfortunately I think my expectations were a little too high as I wasn't really a fan. As others have mentioned, Paseo is  a very tiny hole in the wall with a few tables inside and some picnic tables outside. We arrived right before a rush so were able to get a table inside. I would say that this food isn't really that convenient for a grab and go option since it's pretty messy to eat. I was glad we had the table to spread out on and collect our growing pile of napkins while we ate."
,,,,,"I ordered the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the #1 famous sandwich with pork. The sandwiches are huge, definitely large enough to split. My issues started with the bread - it's way too thick and chewy. One side of mine was also over-toasted which can really wreak havoc on your mouth. The chicken thigh was tender, but not really that flavorful. They use full huge romaine leaves which doesn't really add much to the sandwich and makes it even more difficult to eat. Same thing with the caramelized onions; they were just huge strips that kept squishing out of the sandwich. Finally, I really wanted more flavor! They could have used some more sauce and definitely a lot more cilantro. I added hot sauce at the table which helped. "
,,,,,"Service was friendly and I liked the iced tea. I guess I just don't get the hype, sorry Seattle!"
,,,,,"I tried Un Bien and wasn't sold, so I thought maybe Paseo would be better. Unfortunately, it also didn't wow me. Would I go out of my way for either place? No."
,,,,,"I tried the #1 here, the Caribbean Roast ($10.95). It's a well-sized sandwich, but my main complaint with both this and Un Bien is that the sandwiches are really relying on the meat here. So in each bite, what you get is primarily the pork. And the pork is very wet, bland, and fatty. I personally wouldn't want this as my main sandwich meat. Like Un Bien, I appreciated the caramelized onions and bread. If I returned, I'd opt for a different sandwich -- and maybe that'll change my mind."
,,,,,This place is so good. The roasted pork is so juicy and they put a lot on! Great value for an awesome sandwich
,,,,,"I was very happy to see that Paseo offers delivery via Uber Eats as long-time rival Un Bien unfortunately does not, at least not to my neighborhood. During these pandemic times, whether a restaurant is on one of the food delivery platforms often becomes a determining factor for where we choose to eat from!    "
,,,,,"1) Service (+): It took less than an hour from the time I placed my order on Uber Eats to my food being delivered to my door in downtown Seattle, and the food was still hot and fresh! "
,,,,,"2) Ambiance (-): Granted I've never visited either of Paseo's physical stores, I did see from a fellow Yelper that the Food Safety Rating for Paseo was just ""Okay,"" the second lowest rating after ""Needs to Improve."" Food and staff cleanliness and sanitation is more important than ever during these times of COVID, and this is one dimension I hope the restaurant will really improve on going forward. "
,,,,,"3) Food (-): I had very high expectations for Paseo given the reputation and large fan base it has in Seattle's sandwich scene. As such, I was a bit disappointed with the food. I ordered the signature Caribbean Roast and the Paseo Press - both were a bit dry and lacking in flavor and seasoning. The baguette was perfectly toasted and there were heaps of caramelized onions and sweet peppers as toppings but the overall execution and flavor profile of the sandwich was lacking. I had to add some of the garlic aioli that came with the Caribbean fries to the sandwiches to enhance the taste.  "
,,,,,"4) Value for Money (+): At price points of $11.95-$13.50 for a large sandwich that can fill me over 2 meals, Paseo offers great value for money."
,,,,,Good friendly service. Great flavors. Careful about value; razor thin meat portions in a $14 sandwich before add-ons.
,,,,,"Maybe today was an off day? We ordered the #1 signature and a scallop sandwich. Unfortunately, the card reader was down (reminder to always have cash around!) by the time we arrived. "
,,,,,"Orders took a long time on a busy Friday lunch rush, it looked like the majority of people ordered online and gets it to-go. "
,,,,,"By the time our food arrived, which was around 20-25 minutes, we were so excited to dig in! My scallop sandwich was mainly full of onions and there weren't enough scallops evenly spread out. Spicy level 3 is actually hot, they don't joke around here! My partner had the #1 and the bread was quite soggy by the time he dived in. He also commented on the abundance of onions in the sandwich. The pork itself was delicious, perfectly seasoned! "
,,,,,"Overall, this is a popular neighborhood joint but I would not recommend the scallop sandwich."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"I think about this sandwich too much to have given it 4 stars. Idk why I gave it 4 stars. Don't hate on me. If you have anything in Seattle, it has to be this place and clam chowder at Pike Place."
,,,,,"Went here once but didn't think it was as good as Un Bien. I know they're basically the same thing, but for some reason they just taste a little different. Especially the pork sandwiches. The pork sandwich we got was a little dry and bland. But the one at Un Bien is SO GOOD. So if you don't mind driving a little way farther, I suggest Un Bien. But if you can't, then El Paseo is good."
,,,,,"Big portioned, yummy sandwiches! Would definitely recommend you try this place out when in town. No seating inside, but few tables outside. I loved their churros and fries. Taking away one star since I always found the proportion of meat to bread to be off and too much of the bread, but that's just me :P"
,,,,,"Heard tons of great things about this place and I was really craving a bomb sandwich. I got there early when they first opened. Looking at the menu I opted for the pork shoulder(best in the area) and the chicken strip sandwich. They all sounded really good so I thought I'd give both a try. The pork shoulder was claimed to be the best in America so I had to see for myself, I also really like chicken sandwiches more than beef. "
,,,,,Got my order fairly quick. The chicken one was more on the dry side but the pork one was delicious! It W's juicy and u could taste all the flavoring. Messy but bomb! 
,,,,,Little bit on the pricey side but overall worth it. I would definitely come back for the pork sandwich.
,,,,,"It should be illegal for a place to be THIS DAMN DELICIOUS. I had to get up from my seat and hit a little happy dance because the cubano rolls here are BREATHTAKING. I had to try their famous Cubano Pork Sandwich and my friend got the Chicken roll and we split it. Both were JUICY AND PACKED WITH FLAVOR. But I especially loved the Cubano Pork roll. If you like spice like me, ask for their Habanero green hot sauce. It enhances the flavor that much more! I didn't take any pics of my food bc I devoured it. I honestly was sad once I finished my sandwich. I'm from the Bay Area and Ike's place makes my favorite sandwich but this place blows it outta the park. Definitely will be coming back when I'm in the area and a few more times before leaving Seattle"
,,,,,We ordered two Caribbean roast sandwiches and some kind of sangria. 
,,,,,The sandwiches were delicious and kind of messy. The pork could've been a little more flavorful and the onions caramelized a little more but it was still very good and I'd order it again.
,,,,,"So many, even people outside of Seattle, have told me about Paseo. I finally found the time to give the place a try. I got the most popular sandwich, which is the famous caribbean roast sandwich. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of meaty meals, and this sandwich was that. If you love meat, you would love this sandwich. It is moist and each bite is packed with meat, onions, lettuce, and jalapeños. The meat was juicy and tender, which was a plus. Definitely use the wet cloth they give you, because it falls apart easily!"
,,,,,The food here is amazing and the caramelized  onions goes well with the sandwich and the Alaskan cod is delicious.
,,,,,"Thanks so much for your review Moby, so glad you enjoyed your sandwich!"
,,,,,"Drove into Fremont and walked up to Paseo to order lunch sandwiches back in December. They have blocked off most of the store interior for COVID safety, so we placed our order right inside the front door, waited briefly outside for our food, and drove home to eat."
,,,,,"If I remember correctly, we ordered the Famous Caribbean Roast sandwich, the Paseo Press sandwich, and Caribbean fries. Everything tasted mouthwateringly delicious. The bread was fresh and not crumbly, the pork was juicy, and the fries were hot and well-seasoned (the garlic aioli dip was the icing on the cake). Servings were very generous; we were stuffed afterwards. Absolutely worth the price and will definitely be back to Paseo the next time I am in Seattle."
,,,,,DELICIOUS sandwich and fries.  Skip the margarita tho... it was a salt-laced sour drink that really had no tequila flavor at all.  
,,,,,"When it was suggested to us to try the place and we pulled up, it was almost a 'no', but, once we got inside, the clerk was delightful and the food was VERY tasty -   would definitely come back, but, probably just order water for a drink.  ;)"
,,,,,Probably the best pulled pork/grilled onion sandwich I ever had.
,,,,,"The black beans were a bit soupy, was hoping for more beans, and a tad spicy. Would have preferred slightly milder, but that's just me. Reasonably priced, free delivery is a huge plus; large selection of sides, extra protein, including shrimp."
,,,,,"  Nothing special about the Jasmine rice, but it was cooked perfectly and not salty. I ordered the #2, Paseo Press, which is the standard Caribbean #1 plus ham. Absolutely delicious and perfectly greasy. Very filling and satisfying."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Such great messy sandwiches with a Caribbean flair.  Will give you a good fix for hot sandwiches with the best sauces!
,,,,,"So glad you enjoyed Patti, thanks for taking the time t leave us a review!"
,,,,,"I mean, for a buy one get one free deal, this was a steal. The churros were delicious on their own, and I would say that they were even better eaten without the dipping sauce. The rice bowl was also great, with the meat being super tender and flavorful. There was just enough in the bowl to keep every bite exciting and flavorful. Overall, loved everything about this place!"
,,,,,This is probably my favorite (or close second) sandwiches in Seattle!!! Soooo flavorful yet simple. Their bowls are amazing too and I'd highly recommend the tostones.
,,,,,The food was so good that it delighted a picky and judgmental eater like me. I've never been upset before about their food. 
,,,,,"The food is always consistent here. The service can be slow from time to time, which was one of the places recommended to me shortly after I moved as a ""must-try."" The food was excellent and the service was super good, but still professional! I'd actually go there the next time I'm in town. Would definitely recommend this place, it's a gem. The fries are also fantastic!!"
,,,,,"Eat this by yourself or around people you're very comfortable with. It's the kind of sandwich you'll be eating with two hands, and picking at spilling bits with your thumb and index fingers. Slighty sweet and spicy, caramelized onions and jalapeños are delicious."
,,,,,BEST CARIBBEAN ROAST!!! Super tender pork and large pearl onions (be aware it can be overflowing and a bit messy but that's the fun of it!)
,,,,,Also note that some of the other sandwiches may not be as good (corn is also not that good)
,,,,,"Ordered the Caribbean Roast sandwich. Being from the south, the pork struck me as a very well-executed version of pulled pork. It was sweet, tender, but a bit one-note. "
,,,,,"The sandwich bun had a wonderful shiny, crusty exterior and was perfect with the sauce. IMO the onions should be shaved, not large slabs - also they weren't particularly flavorful. I was hoping the onions would lend a more caramelized flavor. "
,,,,,"Finally, there really should have been more cilantro or some herb to spice it up. That said, this was still a good sandwich. Just not as good as I was expecting. The service was great though."
,,,,,"I asked a friend what is a must eat in Seattle. He said ""Paseo"".  I happened to be looking at their Yelp page at that moment - so it was decided. "
,,,,,"I ordered the #1 pork sandwich and the #5 chicken breast. I wanted to try both. I got the carribean fries, too. The fries were plentiful and fresh, but I did find a big smooshed plantain in the middle of the bag, sloppy. "
,,,,,"When I went I eat my pork sandwich, I took a bite and it had a slice of ham on it, plus banana peppers. I realized I had the #2 pork press sandwich, which I did not want. "
,,,,,"I told the guy inside that I had the wrong sandwich. He needed my number again to confirm which sandwich I ordered. He saw I ordered the number one and then gave me a new sandwich. However, it was apparently not a new sandwich - when I opened it it was not so hot and the bread was soggy. Maybe only a bit old A guy Sloppy!!! Bad first experience! Thanks for the replacement sandwich. "
,,,,,"Since he let me keep the wrong one, I swapped the bread from the fresh one to make the best of it. The chicken and pork were both good, but not amazing. They were both put together pretty haphazardly. They did not have cilantro on either sandwich and very few jalapeños. Maybe the chef was having a bad day. "
,,,,,"The sandwiches are messy, they have wet wipes. Overall, sloppy experience."
,,,,,"Get the first sandwich on the list. Flavorful, JUICY, and super messy. The prawn burger and the second burger on the list are also good, but the first is unarguably the best. If you have space, the corn is also super sinful, but super tasty."
,,,,,The wait is a reasonable time. You'll want to find parking nearby on the street. Friendly staff :)
,,,,,"Really fantastic sandwiches and Mexican corn. Had the prawn sandwiches and the prawns were so JUICY, and they made the whole sandwich flavorful. As for the corn, you might not think it's worth $5, but you'll always be back for more once you experience the yummy creamy sauce running down your chin. Eating here is a messy endeavor, so be sure to take tons of napkins."
,,,,,"I lived in Seattle for almost 2 years before I tried this place. I had some friends visiting and we looked at the menu and saw the Caribbean roast pork sandwich was advertised as the best sandwich in America! We laughed a skeptical laugh but ordered it anyways. Joke was on us, turns out it is the best sandwich in America! Disclaimer: food enhancing substances may have been involved."
,,,,,"I like the other sandwiches too, but just not as much as the Caribbean. I do occasionally get the platter instead of the sandwich though to mix it up. I wish the salad that came with the platter had dressing on it, but it's still good."
,,,,,Edit: I forgot to mention these sandwiches are super reasonably priced.
,,,,,"Had the flagship sando. While tasty, it was one of the messiest sandwiches I've ever eaten which detracted from the whole experience. I wanted this to blow my mind and it was just all right. "
,,,,,"Will be back to try other stuff, super good vibes inside!"

,,,,,"WOW!! Amazing sandwich!! Easily big enough to fill you up. If you read any negative reviews, don't believe it for a second."
,,,,,"Y'all...this place is totally worth the hype. This was our first stop on our Seattle adventures and man did it set the tone for the rest of the trip. We tried the one and only Caribbean roast. Best sandwich I've ever had in my life. Talk about a trip to flavortown! My taste buds were so happy taking each bite lol. The pork shoulder was extremely tender and melts in your mouth, not to mention literally dripping with flavor! You can really taste the love that goes into slow roasting this piece of meat. They got this craft down to the T. The caramelized onions, jalapeños and garlic aioli take it over the top. The Caribbean fries are also very yummy and the perfect compliment to the sandwich. Don't skip out on these! Everything was so delicious, we can't wait to return. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go here. Just do it."
,,,,,I've heard so much about Paseo from all my friends and even people visiting Seattle that I figured it was time for me to try it. Let me say for my sandwich I was not disappointed.
,,,,,"Caribbean Roast Sandwich: Ordered their classic (and I think most well known?) sandwich. Tons of meat, super delicious and so filling I could only eat half. I loved the sauce, the veggies in it and overall was a great sandwich."
,,,,,"Tofu Sandwich: this is where I'm docking a star. My friend is vegetarian and decided to order this sandwich and didn't expect to see any meat in there. When we sat down she saw bits of meat on the top and ends of her sandwich and I ended up taking them off and putting them on my own. I definitely understand it's hard when most of the sandwiches predominantly have meat in them, but I think this is something that restaurants should be mindful of if they are offering a vegetarian option."
,,,,,"Anyway, overall I think we were still both pretty happy with our food and because it's only takeout right now, we went to a small park nearby and had a mini picnic in the shade which was a great move!"
,,,,,A bit disappointed the quality had gone down. The fries was not crispy and no onions and jalapeños on the sandwich.
,,,,,Loved the chicken and pork sandwich. No line as well but I could see the place getting packed during lunch hour. It's my favorite sandwich place now and it's worth all the traffic and wait.
,,,,,The food here was to die for. The location is small but easy to find and parking is accessible around the streets near by. 
,,,,,"We ordered a jambalaya, famous sandwich and a chicken sandwich. The jambalaya was filled with shrimp fish and the works. The chicken sandwich was 10/10. The bread  was crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside and the chicken was tasty and tender TIP add extra chicken. The famous sandwich was BOMB! it had a lot of meat and onions, and I opted for the extra green habanero sauce because Chile is LIFE."
,,,,,"super delicious sandwiches! they pack a lot of meat into a sandwich and fill it with carmalized onions & lettuce. the pork shoulder was very tender and juice, not too fatty and not too lean. the sandwich was very well seasoned and the sauce from the meat was filled with flavor. "
,,,,,"the storefront itself is very small. you go up to the cashier to order/pay and its only one person @ a time so it's pretty cramped. everyone loiters around waiting for their food, which comes out from the other window. about 2-3 small tables available, but overall, seems like more of a takeout place."
,,,,,tip: check in on yelp for a free coffee!
,,,,,"In our last day in Seattle, we searched for a good food place and came across Paseo. We ordered the Caribbean Roast. Like many other reviews said, it was DELICIOUS. The pork was extremely juicy. The caramelized onions and jalapeños went really well and the bread was surprisingly not soggy. "
,,,,,"My honest opinion is that it's definitely a delicious sandwich - could be among the top few I've had - but not sure I'd say it was the best one I've had. To make it stand out even more, I wished it had a little bit more of a kick. Some kind of spicy or sour kick. The jalapeño helped with this, but a little more of that extra complementary taste would make it even better. Still worth a try for a solid and memorable sandwich. "
,,,,,"We also ordered the churros which were arguably the best churros I've ever had. I'm not someone who especially loves churros or goes out of my way to eat a lot of them, but out all of the ones I've had, it was the best. "
,,,,,The churros were perfectly crispy and piping hot (freshly made) - and the best part was the custard filling inside. It came with chocolate dipping sauce that paired well but I personally preferred eating the churros by itself. 
,,,,,"Last note - I saw another review that said it was too messy to eat in the car and this is definitely true. I was lucky to have a plate in the car but if not, it definitely would've left a huge greasy mess so be careful. "
,,,,,TLDR: definitely worth the try. Wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had but for sure a very delicious sandwich.
,,,,,"Phenomenal sandwiches-- I can tell why this place is so busy! It was recommended to us by a local and it did not disappoint. The churros (on the ""hidden menu"") were an absolutely delicious but a little too sweet for my taste. I didn't expect to have an entire pack of them! "
,,,,,"The only downside is that their bathrooms were not up to COVID safety standards and I really don't recommend using them. The outdoor benches also had signs that they are not sanitized regularly and were ""off limits"".. AKA they don't take responsibility if you get sick from them, but leave them outside for customers anyway."
,,,,,"Food was great, service could have been a bit better! We went at lunch time and there was a bit of a line (to be expected). My mom has some hard food allergies and when there was a lull in the line asked the cashier about some ingredients to see what she could have. The woman was a bit short and dismissive. "
,,,,,"When we ordered, I asked for tostones but they never heard me so sadly we didn't get to try them. We ordered lemonade and we're told they were out, but I watched while we waited for food as she made more and ordered once it was done, so it would've been nice to just order at once since we had to wait either way, but I guess she didn't know when she'd be able to make more."
,,,,,"I had the steak sandwich and it was super delicious and huge! I also tried a bite of the famous pork sandwich and it was also great! Overall I recommend going here, just wish the service had been a little friendlier."
,,,,,"the first time i went to seattle, this was on my list. sadly, i didn't make time for it! but on my second visit, i knew i had to squeeze it in my long list of food to eat! i am so glad i made room for this place. because now i need to go here during seattle visits. their sandwiches are SOOO good."
,,,,,"i def had to try their #1famous carribean roast, underneath this, it says ""rated best sandwich in america."" it's marinated pork shoulder, with pickled jalapenos and caramelized onions. this sandwich was amazing!! it was messy, super worth it with all that meat juice. it def had a kick to it, but i should have asked for extra jalapenos. caramelized onions was really goood! the bread was good but it was def a lot of bread. im not complaining, i love bread!! would totally get this again."
,,,,,"i also tried their seared scallop sandwich. from other reviews, it seemed like they don't serve this everyday and it does sell out. so i def had to try this bc i love scallops! for me, this is spicier than carribean roast sandwich. it was def really good too but wish it had more scallops. it was really flavorful! "
,,,,,i cant wait to go back and get more sandwiches!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,Excellent. Unique take on latin sandwiches- mainly Cuban.  Be ready for a garlic explosion.  Their mojo is outstanding. Order tostones!
,,,,,"Hands down the best sandwich I've eaten in a long time. I did not expect to find such a gem like this in Seattle, but I'm so glad we discovered this place. "
,,,,,They offer to go during COVID and it was super simple to just order over the phone before hand - never had to wait for our food. There's plenty of parking on both sides of the street. 
,,,,,"I have tried Famous Caribbean Roast, Smokin' Thighs and Sautéed Prawns sandwiches. All of them were cooked and prepared to utter perfection. If I had to pick my favorite, it would have to be the Famous Caribbean Roast - I understand why it has so much hype as the best sandwich in America. The portions of meat are generous and you could probably get away with split a sandwich with someone cause they are quite filling."
,,,,,"If you're visiting Seattle, this is a stop you must do!"
,,,,,"Giant hunks of grilled sweet onions? Yes please. Tangy banana peppers and some miraculously delicious Mayo (maybe?) sauce thing on this sando. It was messy AF, but the salty ham with the melted Swiss was amazing. And the sweet corn with tangy toppings was incredible."
,,,,,"Hands down one of the best and most unique sandwiches I've ever tried!! Paseo showed up a lot when doing research on what to eat during our visit to Seattle, and it was also getting recommended to us by people in the city, so we made sure to try it."
,,,,,"We ordered the Caribbean Roast and the Caribbean fries. Firstly, the portions are really big! My boyfriend and I shared the sandwich and side of fries and we were pretty filled for a few hours! The sandwich is STUFFED. I was a little overwhelmed by how I should bite into it haha. The flavors in the sandwich were fantastic! The meat was incredibly juicy and the veggies complimented the meat so well. There were jalapeños in the sandwich, but it wasn't spicy at all and added good flavor. The bread was great, and despite everything inside being so juicy, it wasn't soggy! The fries were on the thicker side, but crispy and delicious, seasoned well, and they went well with the sauce they provided. Of all the things we tried in Seattle, this was our favorite. "
,,,,,"If you're visiting Seattle and happen to be sight seeing, Paseo is also just a 15 minute walk or so from the Fremont Troll! Definitely a must try!"
,,,,,Go to un bien. The owner changed long time ago and opened it. 
,,,,,"If you have been to paseo back in 2000-2012 ish time, you 'd know."
,,,,,"Tip: do your Yelp check-in BEFORE you pay for your order. There's a coupon for a free cafe cubano. I found it right after I paid for my order, promptly showed it to the man at the register, but he said I was too late. Perhaps someone didn't want to make me a coffee? Hmmm..."
,,,,,"I wish I could say the food was as bad as the service. But, it wasn't. It was effing amazing. Heavy on the greasy side, but good! "
,,,,,"With a cubano, it would have been damn good. "
,,,,,2 stars for service. 5 stars for the food.
,,,,,The best sandwich I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. Will be back for sure. 6 stars if it were possible.
,,,,,Thank you so much for your awesome review Mark! We appreciate your support and look forward to feeding you again soon!
,,,,,Paseo's tofu one is SO good. I feel very healthy and full after one sandwich. Definitely worth it and will recommend people to try it out!
,,,,,Absolutely delicious Caribbean Roast Sandwich! As our friend who suggested this place said in his review from 8+ years ago it's all about the onions. I'm not sure what they did to make those stand out (especially since I'm not a huge onion fan) but dang they are good! The pork was nice and juicy and the bread was soft with a great chew from the perfectly toasted outside.
,,,,,WOW! No wonder this place is so highly reviewed! I had been meaning to try it forever and finally saw a great Groupon deal that got me in the door. The restaurant itself is adorable but only has a few outdoor uncovered tables for dining so I definitely recommend getting takeout until the sun comes out or we hit the next phase of dining. 
,,,,,"The menu is short, sweet, and accessible. As a gluten-free pescatarian, it was easy for me to see what I could eat, how they could accommodate the different dishes, etc. It had a lot of variety without being overwhelming. If you have any food allergies, this is your spot. The staff was knowledgeable in helping me find something that fits my needs and the menu itself has so many options and substitutions. "
,,,,,"I landed on the West Caribbean Bowl with tofu. I was BLOWN AWAY by the incredible flavor and texture. Especially for the price! It is VERY reasonable and the food will blow you away. I am already looking forward to going back and telling all my friends they have to try it. The chips were phenomenal, the tostones were a wonderful side and scooper for my bowl, and I seriously could not get myself to stop eating it even after I was full because the flavor was just that good. This is a MUST in Seattle!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"I really wanted to like this spot but the sandwiches were just an ""ok"" in my book. The meat was a bit chewy, making the messy sandwich even harder to eat."

,,,,,A visitors perspective.
,,,,,This was hands down my favorite restaurant in Seattle! Sadly I was not able to dine in when I was there. But let me start off by saying I am not over exaggerating when I say this might be one of the best sandwiches i had in my life. I ordered a Caribbean Roast sandwich along with the Caribbean fries and the elote. Every single item was delicious! The roast was just perfectly cooked and all the flavors just mended together when I took a bite. The fries were seasoned extremely well but the sauce that comes with it is addicting. If possible ask for extra sauce and use it on the sandwich and it was a flavor explosion! The elote was just full of flavor as well. I am sad that I did not order this sandwich again as it was just that damn good. When I say do not skip on this place if visiting please do not skip or you will regret it.
,,,,,Would love to write about the awesome Chicken Breast sandwich ... or the succulent Roast Pork sandwich... or even the addictive aioli... but my kiddos wanted me to write about the fries and the super crispy seasoned fries... can't wait to be back
,,,,,Thanks for your review Casey! So glad you and your kids enjoyed your visit! :)
,,,,,Okay so if meat sandwiches are your thing this is your place. We had the #1 Famous pork sandwhich and the ham and cheese. Both super delicious and packed with all the good stuff. You can probably share the #1 unless you're really hungry. 
,,,,,Both come with caramelized onions and pickled peppers or jalapenos. I'd ask for more on the pork sandwich to add a bit more zip. 
,,,,,"If you dont like those you can ask for the sandwiches without, but IMHO it's not as good. "
,,,,,Also had the fresh squeezed peach lemonade which was the perfect blend of sweet and citrus. The cuban coffee was not as good. Way too much milk.
,,,,,Really just solid-as-hell sandwiches - they ARE messy so grab some napkins or maybe even a knife and fork. Don't skip the elote.
,,,,,"My friend and I stopped by Paseo for dinner before our outdoor concert at Gasworks Park. We were intrigued by the #1 on the menu since it was rated ""The Best Sandwich in America."" Paseo made it to Esquire's Best Sandwiches in America list and we were sold. We had to try it! "
,,,,,"The #1 on their menu is their Famous Caribbean Roast. It consists of marinated & slow roasted pork shoulder, cilantro, pickled jalapenos, caramelized onions & crisp romaine served on a toasted baguette. "
,,,,,Ooof. The sandwich was fire! I recommend eating it one sitting or splitting the sandwich with someone while it's still hot from the shop. I don't recommend saving it for leftovers as it doesn't sit well. The bread will get soggy from juices from the meat and veggies. 
,,,,,I'll be back to try the Sauteed Prawns sandwich!
,,,,,Delicious sandwhich and nachos!!!
,,,,,"Caribbean sandwhich was big. The meat was moist. Nachos with roasted beef was my favorite. The portion was big for $6. Everything together were a great combination. Service was fast and friendly. No dine in, call to pre-order and pick up."
,,,,,"Made a trip to Seattle and this was one of my favorite meals I had while I was there! The exterior was a little shack with pink-ish doors, and if I remember correctly they did have one or two small tables outside for seating. Ordering during COVID was really easy - they take your order right behind the door - and food came out quickly. "
,,,,,"As a first-timer, I went with the classic Caribbean Roast, and it was delicious! I am a big sandwich person, and this definitely hit the mark. I thought the portion was really worth the price - there was meat falling out with every bite! And the bread was so fluffy on the inside, a perfect pairing with all the flavorful contents on the inside. "
,,,,,"If you're in the area, would definitely recommend to come here. Makes for a great meal at picnic or after an afternoon at Fremont Brewing. I'm already getting hungry thinking about it"
,,,,,Simplified Review at The Bottom.
,,,,,"I've heard a lot about this place, whether it was food blogs, food videos, or word of mouth. I'm always a bit skeptical about highly praised restaurants but I think it's fair to say that this one definitely hits. I had two lunches before having paseo so, I didn't have that hunger bias that can sway one's taste buds into loving anything. So, this was as fair as fair can be. I ordered the famous Caribbean Roast and a side of fries. And I have no regrets. The sandwich was incredible, probably the best sandwich I have had so far. The roast was incredibly meaty and juicy. The pickled jalapenos were a needed element also. They had the acidity to cut down on the meaty flavor creating a synergy that I believe ratatouille tried to teach me as a kid(The cheese and grape scene). The side of fries provided kept the meal interesting as it acted as a good side of crunch for a texture change up. I highly recommend a try at this spot."
,,,,,Atmosphere: N/A
,,,,,I didn't have a chance to experience in-door dining due to COVID.
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,"Just amazing the Caribbean Roast was everything I could ask for meaty, juicy, tender, and the acidity of the jalapenos were very good. Good portions and the sandwich was a bit messy."
,,,,,Service: 5/5
,,,,,They were nice and the order got out relatively quickly.
,,,,,"Ordered online and did curbside pickup which was very convenient. I got their classic Caribbean Roast sandwich. It's a VERY tasty sandwich but the reason for 1 star deduction: in the 7 min it took us to get to Gasworks to eat it, the bread had gotten soggy. The outer wrapper and bread was a bit oily/greasy. It was almost too juicy because it was so messy to eat and sauce was dripping from my hands. Make sure to bring LOTS of napkins! And if you are eating it picnic style I recommend bringing a plate as well.  The hand wipes Paseo included were a lifesaver."

,,,,,"I stopped by Paseo during a trip to Seattle based on numerous recommendations and this spot lives up to the hype! Paseo is located in a small unassuming storefront and I loved how intimate the setting was. Ordering was easy and the cashiers were so friendly and helpful. Food also came out quickly. I ordered the #1 Caribbean Roast Sandwich and the corn. Both were AMAZING. The Caribbean roast sandwich was a perfect balance of quality bread, saucy spread, fresh greens, tang and spice from the pickled jalapeños, and moist but not too salty pork. My mouth is literally watering as I type this. "
,,,,,I would recommend to anyone in Seattle (residing or visiting) to go to Paseo. I will definitely hit up this spot again if I'm back in Seattle and I'd want to try more menu items too!
,,,,,The Caribbean roast sandwich was delicious! Prepare to get a bit greasy and messy but its absolutely worth it. Theres no way you finish this sandwich and want to eat more!
,,,,,"I never knew I needed a sandwich solely containing caramelized onions but now I can't live without it. Everything on this menu is a banger, you literally cannot make a wrong choice. The chips and salsa are a must with every meal too! I daydream of paseo for lunch daily"
,,,,,"Thanks for your awesome review Marena, so glad you enjoy your Paseo visits!"
,,,,,"So good. Even the lettuce on the sandwiches tastes fresh and crunchy - ok started with lettuce to convince myself there's something deeply healthy, but seriously- this is legitimately delicious cheat meal food."
,,,,,Tostones are the best in Seattle
,,,,,Roasted corn is the absolute perfect texture- cooked perfectly and tasty beyond the seasoning on it
,,,,,And the sandwiches- roasted pork and chicken thighs- either way you can't go wrong. 
,,,,,Love the onions at In N Out? I dare you to try them here.
,,,,,5 stars!
,,,,,Paseo is a hole in the wall on Fremont St that offers Cuban sandwiches and meat plates. We stopped by for a quick bite for lunch. 
,,,,,Storefront was easy to find and there was plenty of street parking. Paseo was COVID compliant and offered outdoor seating & orders to go.
,,,,,We got the following:
,,,,,"Flagship Cuban Sandwich - Cuban pulled pork served on a baguette with caramelized onions, and caramelized onions. Pork was extremely tender, but lacked some flavor. Bread was soft. Be warned, sandwich is very messy to eat. "
,,,,,"Paseo salad - Ordered with pork (extra charge for meat). Salad was lettuce, pickled cabbage, picked beets, pork, and cilantro lime dressing. Simple, clean salad. Again pork lacked flavor."
,,,,,"Paseo is a great choice for a quick bite. Prices are reasonable and service is great. Though food was tasty, meat was lacking some flavor (hence 4 stars). Would return if in the area."
,,,,,"This place came highly recommended to me as THE place to get my Cuban sandwich fix in Seattle. While the Famous Roasted Corn was EVERYTHING (seriously I could just stuff myself with a bunch of those and be a happy clam), the sandwich itself was not worth the hype for me. I enjoy caramelized onions as much as the next person but there is an overuse of oversized onions in the sandwich, rendering the whole thing a soggy wet mess to eat. I found myself more regretting the heaviness of the sandwich then feeling happy with indulgence. That being said the corn will still have me coming back and I just need to try other items on the menu."
,,,,,"Spent about a week in Seattle on a foodie vacation, and I'm surprised (and also pleased) to say that a Caribbean/Cuban sandwich place ended up being the best place to check out."
,,,,,"My brother, cousin, and I had the Caribbean Roast, the Paseo Press, and the Grilled Pork Loin, and they were all delicious.  To be absolutely honest, if you had to tell me to pick these apart from each other -- I wouldn't be able to, but they all had distinct flavors, and my cousin (who's a VERY picky eater) gobbled it down. "
,,,,,"Aside from the sandwiches, you can also order churros that come with a caramel dipping sauce.  Each order comes with six, and the cool thing is they're already filled.  They're awesome and give Disneyland's a run for their money. Pretty sure the lemonades are just flavored with syrups, so they're nothing to write home about."
,,,,,"Paseo is a way's away from Downtown Seattle, so if you don't have a car this is a place I'd definitely recommend ride sharing to.  Once you're there, at least for now, they're still following COVID protocol. You gotta be masked when you make your order, and while there's no indoor dining, there are two tables outside and the people working do a good job making sure that at least paying customers have been seated."
,,,,,I'll definitely be back here during my next trek to Seattle!
,,,,,Totally deserving of the best Sandwich award they proudly display. Worth fighting through parking. Fried plantains are a good add as well.
,,,,,Thank you Othon! Glad you enjoyed!
,,,,,"Got the carribean roast sandwich and it was ah-ma-zing! Tender and juicy meat, loved the addition of onions and some lettuce. Bread itself was perfectly crispy, but soggy from juicy added a great flavor. Easy grab n go to enjoy with a view"
,,,,,The Caribbean Roast Sandwich (the number 1) is really a jam packed sandwich full of flavor. Really can't go wrong with ordering a #1. The pork was super moist. It is a very juicy sandwich so I suggest eating it with caution. Juice gets all over your hands and down your arms if you aren't careful. The bread was chewy and thick to soak up all of the sauce. The onions were majorly good- soft and golden. I could eat a side of those alone! 
,,,,,"The Caribbean fries were crispy golden, just how I like it. The only thing is how are they Caribbean? The sauce looked and tasted like thousand island sauce with jalapeños in it. "
,,,,,Service was excellent. The cashier was very cheerful. The person calling out numbers was super nice. They even filled up our water bottle (as we just got back from a hike and needed hydration). That was awesome! 
,,,,,The only drawback is that there is limited seating. They have only 2 tables set up with 4 chairs total. We had to sit across the street a ledge near the neighbor's house. Not sure if that was so appropriate but oh well.
,,,,,"Overall, order the #1. Skip the fries. Wear a bib or protective gear (aka napkins). Be prepared to eat in your car or take it to go."

,,,,,"I've been frequenting Paseo for the past few years and I'm happy to say that their food is always of high quality and delicious. My most recent trip here, we ordered to-go. We ordered the spicy scallop sandwich, spicy prawn sandwich, and jambalaya. "
,,,,,"The fish from the sandwiches tasted fresh and had a good amount of spice. The jambalaya was great and had big chunks of seafood and other meats within the dish. Overall, I would highly recommend ordering food from Paseo when in the Fremont area."
,,,,,"Me and my boyfriend came here for the first time last Saturday right when it opened. We were lucky enough to be the first people to order our food! My boyfriend ordered the Caribbean Roast, the sandwich they are most known for. I ordered the Shrimp Sandwich. "
,,,,,"Both sandwiches were phenomenal! The sandwiches were messy if you don't like to get your hands dirty, but so so tasty. I'm happy to say that Paseo exceeded my expectations and I will definitely be back for more!"
,,,,,"I came to this little hole in the wall with my friend who visited me from Baltimore. We had two sandwiches and both were absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced (entire meal was 25 bucks). The sandwiches are filled with fresh meat, tasty caramelized onions, and jalapeños. I would say this is a unique cuisine and a must try in Seattle. Also, for vegetarians they do have a tofu sandwich on the menu."
,,,,,I kid you not I've had Paseo bookmarked on my Yelp list for over 5 years prior to my first visit and I'm glad I was able to check it out this next visit and I can see why it's a local favorite! Small shop with no seating so everything is to go but when we arrived there was already a queue so a good sign.
,,,,,"They are known for their sandwiches on their menu, but they also serve rice plates, salads, and sides of corn, beans, fries, etc. that are a good mixture of meat and vegetarian options. Sandwiches start ~$11+ so pretty affordable and they are filling so you can potentially keep them for two meals. "
,,,,,"Parking can be sparse around the area but not too much trouble since you'll be grabbing and going. We ordered the #1 Caribbean Roast, #10 Onion Obsession, Caribbean Fries, and Churros to go and it took around 15 mins to get all items. "
,,,,,Both sandwiches we ordered were delicious. Bread was thick and the sandwiches were filled to the brim with protein and fix-ins. They are super juicy so be sure to keep them wrapped tight or all the ingredients might fall out (trust from experience haha). Not a dry piece of bread in sight! 
,,,,,Fries are also a great option to get if you're in a group since they are a large portion. They are flavored with a nice seasoning that has a nice kick so a nice change from the standard salt only. I would also highly recommend the churros since they are close to 3 large churros cut up and filled with some custard and paired with a gooey caramel dip. 
,,,,,"All in all, the sandwiches and sides here are solid and great if you want to pick up before heading to a park to eat on a blanket like we did. We had leftovers as well so the portion size justified the price for me."
,,,,,"Thank you so much for your review and photos, we’re so glad you enjoyed your visit!! :)"
,,,,,"The sandwiches here are classic. I'm not a fan of food that gets my hands messy, but Paseo is worth it."
,,,,,"Thanks for your review Darren, so glad you enjoy!"
,,,,,I'm from Philadelphia and it's a city known for good sandwiches. I've been to places around the states that claims a good sandwich............like primanti bros' sandwich is trash. 
,,,,,"I got the #1 and man this was delicious, everything goes well together and complimented each other. The pork was tender, the caramelized onions, jalapeno and aioli sauce was a great match. I definitely want to eat it again."
,,,,,"The sandwiches here are delectable. They're suuuuper messy, so be careful. But wow. The mix of flavors is amazing. The meat is cooked tenderly and is full of flavor. The caramelized onions are fantastic. This is not a diet food, and it's not a good food to eat if you're trying to look cute and proper, but dang it tastes good!"
,,,,,"It's a total hole in the wall. Two tables inside, maybe six outside. I had an inside table, Thankfully, there was an exposed outlet so I could charge my phone. I just had to be sure to not touch the back side of the outlet since there was a rusty nail sticking out. They do have certain flags hanging up that I didn't appreciate, but I will be nice and overlook that. "
,,,,,"But onto the food. Their trademark sandwich is the Caribbean Roast, slow cooked shredded citrus pork, topped with pickled jalapenos, ridiculously thick cut caramelized onions, cilantro, and garlic aioli. It lived up to the huge hype. Sweet, spicy, juicy as can be. And so messy, as the divine combination of citrus juice and aioli ran down my wrists."
,,,,,"We also split the scallop sandwich, same toppings, also really good, but the pork is the star. "
,,,,,"And don't forget the sides! The roasted corn is amazing, pungent spices, butter, parmesan cheese. Super tender kernels, a little spicy, super zesty. Great cobs, good thing we ordered one for each of us. I also liked the fries, they added some of the same spices to the thick cut potatoes and served them with an extra side of aioli. Now this is not your standard  aioli. Most are white in color, this one was pink, it looked a little like Thousand Island. And it was so garlicky, that  even I could taste it and that is saying a lot!"
,,,,,"Good job having Mexican Cokes with real sugar, the way God intended them! The total meal came out to about $55, it may sound like a decent amount of money, but this place is unique in their cuisine and they do a great job with their execution. Fremont may not be my kind of neighborhood, but this is a place for everyone to check out."
,,,,,"The sandwich that is their ""most famous"", is really good, but honestly if you want better Caribbean food at a better price, hop in your car, drive four more minutes up the street, and eat at Bongos."
,,,,,"My wife and definitively decided that Bongos is better both in taste and the price is nicer on the wallet. (Sure it's only a few bucks, but to a frugal guy, that means everything)."
,,,,,"Paseo's definitely has changed over the years and I would say it has been getting slightly worse each year. Overall, this place is still one of the top Caribbean sandwich places but there's definitely better ones around! "
,,,,,Service has always been stellar and quick. Normally it takes less than 10 minutes to get your food. 
,,,,,There's a nice side area with seating if you want to eat there but most people get take out!
,,,,,"A sweet gem of a place. We ordered Smokin Thighs, Famous Caribbean delight, Tostones, rice and famous roast corn and everything was tasty! Well seasoned and service was quick. Definitely recommend."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98103"
,,,,,"I'm not sure what the hype was really about because these sandwiches were definitely meh...if you like huge pieces of slightly cooked onions, and oily meat, this might be the place for you."
,,,,,"My friends and I got the Flagship Carribean Roast ($12), Havana Seared Scallops ($15), and Raspberry Lemonade ($4)."
,,,,,"The first bite into the sandwich was 60% onion. The onions were impossible to tear apart, and wayyy to overpowering for the rest of the meat. The scallop were not seasoned, so be prepared for that."
,,,,,"ALSO, definitely NOT a place to sit in during the winter! You'll freeze to death since there is no proper heating, or warm water in the bathroom!"
,,,,,"Sandwiches here are pretty good. Large size, lots of flavor. On the oilier side but that's pretty much the point I think.  Fries were also decent, not soggy at all. Make sure to get some napkins! "
,,,,,"Smaller restaurant and they're busy seemingly at all hours, so plan ahead and/or do takeout"
,,,,,"What a gem! The famous carribean roast my partner loved! I had the trip bowl with roasted pork and daaaamn the meat was so good! Great value for money as well, portions are huge, we went home with leftovers"
,,,,,"Thanks for your review Carla, so glad you enjoyed!"
,,,,,Loooots of meat
,,,,,The size is like a 12inch subway
,,,,,Totally enough for a girl
,,,,,Juicy!
,,,,,Out of expectation
,,,,,"I went on a Sunday evening to get some sandwiches to go for dinner, recommended by a friend who brought me to Fremont. I ordered the number 1, the Famous Caribbean Roast, which the menu claims as rated ""The Best Sandwich in America"" - their marinated, slow-roasted pork shoulder sandwich. We also got their chips and salsa and their churros with caramel sauce. The sandwich was incredible, full of juicy meat, onions, and greens spilling out of the baguette. The chips and salsa were okay, but the churros were fantastic. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes for our order and demolished everything after we took it back to eat. I'd definitely come back and try out one of their other sandwiches."
,,,,,"Hi William, thanks so much for your great review! We're SO glad you enjoyed your visit and appreciate your support! Can't wait to see you back soon."
,,,,,"Not much to say here that hasn't been said already. This sandwich is so freaking good. The layer of meat is thicker than the bread, and giant pearlescent onions spill out as you're trying to open your mouth wide enough to take a bite. It is a messy meal, so make sure you've got plenty of napkins. "
,,,,,"I saved half of it to eat a couple hours later. After toasting it in the oven, the bread had this amazing crunch and was super flavorful after soaking in the meat juices. Not soggy at all."
,,,,,"This was ok, the prices were pretty high imo for the food you received but I guess that is the way of the world with all of the inflation happening right now."
,,,,,"The food was a bit greasy for my liking but my boyfriend loved his sandwich minus the 5lbs of greasy onions on it.  There aren't a ton of ""healthy"" or ""low cal"" options but if you go knowing you are gonna eat all of your calories in one sitting, you will be fine."
,,,,,I loved the roasted corn (elote) and would go back for that alone.
,,,,,Service was meh. Gal didn't seem super interested in answering questions about the menu.
,,,,,"On street parking.  Just a handful of tables inside.  I think this is a more ""grab and go"" type of place."
,,,,,"Cuban sandwiches are really hard to find in Seattle for some reason but Paseo does an admirable job. The pork shoulder is super tender, melt in your mouth with the right amount of fat. Very well seasoned with tons of flavor. Traditionally, you don't add lettuce and there should be mustard but maybe this is Seattle's take on the Cuban sandwich."
,,,,,Follow my Instagram @nikon.foodie for my detailed review!
,,,,,Had similar sandwiches before that I kept dreaming about and couldn't wait to fly to Seattle to finally eat it again. I heard Paseos was similar and I don't know if it's a year of dreaming about a sandwich that it didn't live up to the figment of my dreams or maybe it was just ok. They are still darn good sandwiches! Just not going to be dreaming about them.
,,,,,"I did get them through doordash so I'll disregard the slightly soggy bread. I got the Caribbean which was juicy and soft. This was my favorite. It wasn't dream worthy though. Also tried the scallop sandwich. Scallops were good, but I just picked them out and ate them. Didn't seem to go well with the warm lettuce and soggy bread that I'm trying to disregard. I also got the steak, which I was looking forward to the most but it just tasted like a regular steak sandwich, nothing special. "
,,,,,"As a sandwich hater, I still think this place is really good. No complaints if someone wanted to eat here. It just wasn't the mind blowing sandwich that my heart and dreams have been longing for"
,,,,,"A cute little storefront up the hill from the Fremont Troll, Paseo is a Caribbean sandwich shop with a lot of selections. "
,,,,,"We had to get the #1 Famous Caribbean Roast as it's advertised as their best sandwich and it definitely did not disappoint! The pork was tender and pulled apart while the garlic aioli and caramelized onions really rounded out the sandwich. For a meaty sandwich, it was still able to provide a lot of freshness with the cilantro and other veggies. It was reminiscent of a vietnamese banh mi in regards to the freshness but obviously had a different flavor profile of the pork."
,,,,,It's located in the Fremont area which is a little north of downtown Seattle but do make the trip especially if you are in the area!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"So smooth and creamy! Definitely a sweet treat, and I would consider it dessert. My favorite flavors are Pumpkin pie, marionberry, passion fruit, lemon curd, mango, key lime pie and apple pie. So delicious. Samples are plenty. A seattle Pike Place Market treat. Can they figure out how to turn it into a frozen yogurt soft serve??"
,,,,,Soo good! There were only a few other people line when I went on a Saturday morning so we hardly had to wait. They let you sample the yogurt before you order which is very nice!
,,,,,I got the Marionberry flavor based on everyone else's recommendation and was not disappointed. I did sample the marionberry pie flavor which was good but a little too sweet for me. 
,,,,,"It was a nice little breakfast to have while walking around and enjoying the market. I do want to note that it was a little difficult to find it since there isn't a sign but it's directly in front of the giant neon ""public market"" sign!"
,,,,,Thanks for making the time to write a review--and for finding us! We're available at your neighborhood Whole Foods (Fremont) so check out the yogurt aisle there. Enjoy!
,,,,,"They give you a ton of yogurt, and even though I'm lactose intolerant it's still a good time. Sometimes the line may look daunting, but just keep circling back until it shortens and soon you too can enjoy some lactose."
,,,,,BEST. YOGURT. EVER!
,,,,,I tried this on a suggestion and I am sold. I won't eat another brand of yogurt.
,,,,,"So delicious!!! I'll had the ""OM ALI"" the best Greek Yogurt I had ever tried , must go !!"
,,,,,"Decided to stop by while visiting Pikes Place. It's located in the corner, diagonal to the Public Market sign."
,,,,,"With so many options available and me being very indecisive, I had to try a few before I finally got the Orange turmeric and loved it. It was something different than usual yogurt flavors and the yogurt itself tasted very creamy and rich. I got the size small and it was more than enough for me. They are very generous with the amount they put in that small cup."
,,,,,"I am not a big yogurt person so it was one of those ""one time try and because I am visiting Pikes Place"" thing for me."
,,,,,Thanks for making time to review us--and you discovered my personal favorite flavor. Hope to see you again when you come back to Seattle!
,,,,,"7 years after leaving my first review, and trying Ellenos, I'm back. I will always come back. Ellenos is now an addiction. Ellenos has ruined me for any other yogurt. I can't eat any other yogurts now. It use to be at just the Pike Place Market, but now its expanded, and I can't escape it. Ellenos is Everywhere.  They sell it  by the case at my local Costco now. I stock an entire shelf in my fridge with cases. I have at least one container a day, sometimes two.....I'm lactose intolerant. My taste buds don't care, they beckon me to eat creamy spoonful, after creamy spoonful, my stomach is in knots for 10 mins after, & my asshole is angry. "
,,,,,"I'm afraid to see what the next 7 years will bring, I'm afraid I will sell my earthly possessions  to afford my Ellenos addiction. If you see me sucking dick in the Costco parking lot, for a case of Ellenos, please pray for my soul...... Or don't and just bring me more Ellenos....... Would you like to buy my soul in trade for some Ellenos?"
,,,,,I don't give out 5 stars easily. 
,,,,,"Flock to this place, thank me later, your taste buds will thank YOU. BEST Yogurt i have ever had, I can't even eat store bought anymore."
,,,,,Have tried nearly EVERY flavor and ALL of them have been DELICIOUS!
,,,,,You can even mix flavors I suggest the Chai and Latte combo.
,,,,,Favorite so far is the Lemon Cheesecake. 
,,,,,Drooooool!!
,,,,,Everyone who works at the Pike Place location is delightful esp the manager! 
,,,,,If you go often be sure to inquire about the frequent buyer program!
,,,,,You've got exceptional Greek Yogurt served here at Ellenos in the same form and fashion as you find gelato; and it'd be a lie to say that you can't compare the two in terms of being a satisfactory dessert. 
,,,,,Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
,,,,,"Ellenos is run virtually identically to your standard ice cream shop, and to my surprise even on a warm Saturday morning the line out here at Pike Place Market wasn't bad. Star. "
,,,,,Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
,,,,,"It seems the pricing at Ellenos has fluxed a bit lately, and while I saw images of menu signs on the internet quoting $3.75 for a walkaround small portion, I'm pretty sure I ended up paying $5.00. Either way, that wasn't unreasonable given the richness and quantity. Star."
,,,,,Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
,,,,,"As others have stated, the Greek yogurt at Ellenos really is exceptional. I'm afraid to take a peak at the nutrition facts, but this is easily a substitute for ice cream. You've got a fantastic whipped up texture that still packs a dense flavor punch, and it wouldn't be hard to really go overboard and eat a whole tub of this stuff. Two Stars. "
,,,,,Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?
,,,,,"So I'm a bit torn here. Ellenos is excellent yogurt, and while it's comparable to ice cream, the price point and range of flavors have me thinking that I'd still choose ice cream over this just about any day. Now, if you tell me that Ellenos is obviously more healthy than ice cream I'm listening, but I'm honestly not sure that's the case. No Star."
,,,,,Passionfruit Greek yogurt for the win :)
,,,,,Super delicious! You can grab it at most stores here in Seattle but it's super fun to visit them at Pikes Place.
,,,,,"I split a small sized portion of the Marionberry Pie with my friend. My only complaint is that I didn't order enough! I could have easily polished off a FAMILY sized portion in that moment instead. The yogurt was so creamy & delicious! The fruit flavor of the berries were apparent & not overpowering as it so often is. Some pie crust dust was sprinkled on top of it which tasted amazing & added some bite & a slight crunch to each spoonful. The spoons are compostable & the containers are in plastic- they have a ""walk around"" size which is in a small & narrow cup as opposed to a flat & wide container, which you hold as you walk around pike place! So creative."
,,,,,"The line itself was short when I got on, but rapidly grew because it's THAT good. Considering the sheer amount of volume & ability to get overwhelmed, the employees were rockstars. Looks like they've got an efficient system set up in order to let people order quickly."
,,,,,"Only two negatives; when I went, they were receiving card only (indicated by a sign). Not sure if this was a ""for a day"" thing or a ""covid"" thing, but if you wanted to pay cash I don't think you could. Might be a long term thing. Second, don't think you can split a small with a friend & be satisfied afterwards!!!!! Would 100% recommend & buy again from!!!! Can't wait to try their other flavors!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Yogurt goodness! Another must try location at Pike Place Market! I got the Passion Fruit and it was, well it did not taste like your regular standard Greek yogurt! The quality was there and definitely elevated to the next level~ I recommend the $5 to go one, so you can walk around the pike market while enjoying your yogurt! "
,,,,,It is located in the corner of the street across from famous Public Market Center sign
,,,,,Thank you so much for your review! Hope you can come back to Seattle again soon.
,,,,,"The Delaurenti Olive Oil and Himalayan Salt yogurt was an  incredible balance of sweet, salty and tart. I highly recommend it. It sounds both weird and simple but packs a lot more flavor than you might imagine. This remains the best yogurt I've had and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to come back to this spot after many years."
,,,,,Could greek yogurt really be worthy of a 5 star review?  YES.  And 2 stops there during a 4 day visit to Seattle.  Amazing.  We tried the marionberry pie and the pumpkin pie.  Both delicious.  Marionberry pie is a 10.  Pumpkin pie is a 9 (and if we hadn't tried the marionberry pie we would have probably thought pumpkin pie was amazing).  Only regret was that we didn't try more flavors.  
,,,,,"Don't miss this on your ""food tour"" of Pike's market."
,,,,,"My favorite yogurt! And one place at Pike Place Market I always take all visitors to.  My favorite favor is passion fruit, but today I tried their newest flavor Brownie Batter and it did not disappoint.  They sell Ellenos at Whole Foods, QFC and at their location in Pike Place but you can buy it online and ship it to other states. How cool of a gift is that? If you have not had this local deliciousness please do. They have lots of yummy flavors. A ral treat!"
,,,,,"I am not a yogurt lover, but my friend said I should try it at least once."
,,,,,"I was want to try the sample and walk away, but I change my mind just after that. "
,,,,,I am finally ending up get one and finish them all. LOVE it.
,,,,,I will go back. :)
,,,,,"To be honest, I am not a fan of yogurt at all. However, I knew after seeing so many pictures of Elleno's Yogurt that I needed to give this place a try!"
,,,,,"The fiancé and I sampled a few flavors before deciding on the Chai and Latte combo. Both were delicious and tasted amazing together. The consistency of the yogurt was creamy and thick, almost like a custard rather than a yogurt to me. We shared the Walkaround and it was more than enough for us!"
,,,,,"Overall, a nice treat to grab while exploring Pike Place Market!"
,,,,,"Incredible yogurt - it's fantastic that these are readily available in grocery stores too. It's the high-fat kind, so probably not the most healthy ""daily"" yogurt. However it is quality, and the employees here are fantastic. I love the plain, but have had the pleasure of trying the brownie batter through their generous Yelp event."
,,,,,Wow!  I can't even with this place.  We got the marionberry with cookie crumbles and the lemon curd cheesecake with cookie crumbles. Both insanely good. I could eat this every day.  So dang good. Definitely make this a stop on your Pikes Place food tour!!!
,,,,,Thank you so much for stopping by! We're so happy to hear you enjoyed our yogurt!
,,,,,"I know there's a long list of things to try when you're at Pike Market in Seattle. However, this needs to go on your top 5. Actually, scrap that. Top 3. "
,,,,,"After exploring my way through Pike and eating all sorts of goodness (read: all the mac n cheese, pastries and chowders) I needed something sweet to finish off my day. I saw that Ellenos had such great reviews and gave it a try. Wow, this is just a another level of yogurt. It is like eating a creamy gelato but fluffier and smoother. The display is also like an ice cream/gelato shop too. The workers helping us were super kind and let my indecisive self try various samples until I finally made up my mind. "
,,,,,"The first day (yes, I came right back the next day) I got the PB&J because I'm obsessed with peanut butter and it was their seasonal flavor. The second day, I got the marionberry cheesecake and the blueberry matcha. All three were so delightful, perfectly sweetened and fresh. I quite literally had cravings for Ellenos for a week straight when I went back to SoCal. "
,,,,,Fast forward a few months and I randomly stumbled upon them at my local grocery store and you bet I was overwhelmed with joy. The poor lady who was there to represent them and give out samples probably didn't know how to react to me bouncing around left & right. Same great taste that brings me back to amazing memories at Pike Place.
,,,,,"Jessica,"
,,,,,Thank you for finding and trying us! Please tell your friends that we're in your neighborhood grocery store. :-) Liz
,,,,,"Very good marionberry pie yogurt. It's a treat I feel less guilty about because it has more protein than ice cream. I also sampled the passion fruit yogurt. That was really good. If I lived in Seattle, I'd buy them by the pint to eat every morning. Yum."
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Best yogurt!!  The place that we return to every time we are in Seattle!!  Marionberry pie is the best flavor!
,,,,,I love Greek yogurt. Throw in giant hunks of fresh fruit and pie and I've died and gone to heaven. 
,,,,,"This was a recommendation to me from a friend's friend who was born and raised in Seattle. Like I shared before, I was already sold but there is something special about this place. "
,,,,,The customer service is next level which surprised me because this location is prime Seattle Farmers Market directly across from the fish throwing booth.   
,,,,,And close to the original Starbucks.After I sampled every flavor in the case I settled on Marion Berry and Pumpkin Pie. 
,,,,,"And, I came back the next day got the same exact combination. At $5, you can't beat it!"
,,,,,"Leah, thanks so much for the review! Hope to see you again soon."
,,,,,"Surprisingly short line in the afternoon on a Saturday, can't go wrong with the original marionberry pie. Pro-tip go one size larger as afterwards you'll want some more for later. I got lucky and got mine freshly made."
,,,,,"Their yogurt is by far the best yogurt you'll ever have. My favorites are the classics - lemon curd, Marionberry, and vanilla bean - but you really can't go wrong with any choice. The perfect balance of creamy, smooth, and sweet their yogurt will satisfy any ice cream, frozen yogurt, or other similar treat cravings."
,,,,,"I wasn't sure about ""greek yogurt"" so I asked for a couple of samples. I was sold! The flavors were AMAZING. My family got orange, lemon curd, passionfruit, green tea and pumpkin. All the flavors were absolutely amazing. Green tea was a bit odd with the greek yogurt flavor but if you like green tea then get you some!! "
,,,,,The location it at the corner right across the big photo op market sign. 
,,,,,Service was outstanding and sincerely so so kind. 
,,,,,I'm lactose intolerant and my advice would
,,,,,"be to take a couple of lactaid pills before you eat their yogurt if you are, too. "
,,,,,This place lives up to all the hype. Go get you some!!!
,,,,,"Jennifer,"
,,,,,"Thanks so much for your kind review! Please note that Ellenos is available in ""prepacks"" at Central Market in Austin. See you in the yogurt aisle. :-) Liz"
,,,,,I love love love their yogurt. Im so excited about the pumpkin pie cant
,,,,,wait to try it!
,,,,,"It was really delicious!!! I highly recommend Ellenos Real Greek Yoghurt  It's this delightful sweet spot not very distant from the juncture between nutritious, yummy ,awesome & delicious"
,,,,,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Ellenos !
,,,,,Its really good - its a Seattle icon - it should definitely be a part of your Pike Place Market experience. Have you tried their Om Ali flavor? Its fabulous.
,,,,,"In Seattle with my 82-year-old mother and staying just around the corner from Pike Place Market, we decided to give Ellenos a try for breakfast on our first morning. Of course, I was already familiar with Ellenos yogurt, but my grocery in Portland only offers a few flavors. Here, at their Pike Place location, they have probably 25 or more flavors, each one better than the last! PLEASE let me recommend the Chocolate Almond, if they have that flavor the day you go.  It's rich and decadent, but it's DELICIOUS!! Another favorite was some sort of cinnamon streusel granola situation and OMG, it was the bomb! Also, the lemon curd, YES, and the marionberry pie! As you probably guessed, we returned every morning to try a different flavor. We had the same cheerful server every visit, and she was a a delight to see every morning. Don't miss this stop on your Pike Place Market shopping spree, but save room. It may be yogurt but it's filling and tastes like a decadent dessert. Sorry I didn't get a pic...my hands were full."
,,,,,"When recently visiting Seattle I stumbled upon ELLENOS! This place can quickly and successfully satisfy a sweet tooth. With their sweet, tangy, tart lemon  curd and creamy yogurt, you will be very happy! Do not be afraid to mix flavors together. I was easily pleased with their lemon cheesecake. My partner and I came here two days in a row. On the second day we blended two flavors together (blueberry and lemon cheesecake). All I can say is YUM and please try. Now that I am back in San Diego please know that I already have two small ELLENOS waiting to be eaten already!!"
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Delicious and unique flavors. More flavors than you usually see in the supermarket for this brand but even better than that you can mix and match the flavors on different sized yogurt containers. It's a fun breakfast to grab in the market and they let you sample flavors before you buy. Happy friendly staff and great experience. Very good quality
,,,,,"Yum. How could this be yogurt?! So decadent, the texture so extra super smooth. Tried the green tea blueberry (subtle green tea flavor) and lemon curd (not too acidic; nice and pleasant lemon flavor). Would recommend both!"
,,,,,"Pretty good! Solid little yogurt place at Pike Place Market with pretty cool flavors. For me, I tasted more sweetness than the tanginess but I am not bothered by it. Worth giving it a shot when you are around and bout."
,,,,,It's messy but it's good. I went to the pike place location on a Friday morning and didn't even have to wait in the God-awful weekend lines thank goodness. 
,,,,,I got the marionberry pie and it was phenomenal. The pie crust or whatever the heck was in there really cut the tartness of the Greek yogurt and it was so yummy. I don't even know what Marionberries are but I apologize for not appreciating them sooner. Stop by and give it a try!
,,,,,"Came here when picking up yogurt for an event.  I found out that the Pike Place yogurt location has some exclusive flavors that can't be found anywhere else, so I had to try.  I love that they're still allowing tastings in the time of Covid  (a lot of other businesses aren't, and I'm not entirely sure why, since it doesn't seem to increase the risk of transmission any more than normal buying/eating)."
,,,,,"I got to sample the olive oil and sea salt, which was interesting, and the chai and latte which were both really tasty.  I really loved the chai flavor for how surprisingly floral it was.  I got a $5 walk around cup, which doesn't have a lid.  But even though my serving was right up to the top of the rim, the yogurt is so thick, it doesn't spill!  Service was super nice."
,,,,,"Be aware that this location is card only, no cash."
,,,,,While touring around Pike Place Market for Starbucks this place got my attention. We got a original and flavored and its delicious. Love their yogurt from original to their flavored yogurt.
,,,,,Simply the best yogurt on the market. i am salivating just thinking about it. 
,,,,,"if you haven't tried Ellenos Greek Yogurt you're missing out on one of Seattle's finest. The lemon yogurt I believe is their first triumph is nothing short of fantastic. Nearly impossible for me to walk by it in the dairy aisle...husband has to monitor my intake. What more can I say about this rich, creamy, delectable and flavorful yogurt? It's the best!"
,,,,,"Best tasting Greek yogurt ever!!! Been here several times and when in the area, I have to stop by and get some this yummylicious treat! "
,,,,,I do purchase some to go for home. I've brought family and friends here to give it a try.  Highly recommended!!
,,,,,Thanks for making the time to review us!
,,,,,I was in Seattle for 5 days and not a day goes by without me thinking about this yogurt. The Marionberry pie flavor was so GOOD and creamy and the passionfruit was citrusy and light everything tasted like ice cream and was SO GOOD SO GOOD
,,,,,While exploring Pike Place we stopped at Ellenos and we're so happy that we did! We got Marionberry Pie yogurt and it was the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness and I really appreciated the graham cracker pie crust pieces. Will definitely get this again next time I'm in Pike Place!
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Ellenos yogurt has been on of my favorites for as long as I can remember. They are always sold out of key lime at my local stores that carry Ellenos and when I got to try it fresh from theIr Pike Place stand, it was well worth the wait. The bits of crust and hint of lime is everything. The Chai was good too, just not one of my favorites or a wow moment. This is actually the only Greek yogurt I like. Any other brands just aren't the same."
,,,,,"My first yelp elite experience with ellenos! Honestly my favorite of the 3 fall flavors was the pumpkin pie. I realized texture is pretty important when it comes to taste (the crunch was amazingg) the other two flavors (cherry vanilla and apple caramel) were good too but a bit too watery/creamy for my taste. Regardless, all were great flavors and pretty filling!"
,,,,,The reviews for this place were extremely high so my expectations were also on that level. I thought the yogurt was good but nothing mind blowing really. I can see why a lot of people like up for this with many flavors offered and it is a nice snack while walking around.
,,,,,"This place is so good!! I had to go here twice in my one weekend in seattle. I tried the marionberry pie, traditional with honey, strawberry shortcake, and blueberry. All of the flavors were amazing but the marionberry pie was what got me hooked. The yogurt is tasty and smooth and they have so many flavors to choose from. The line looks long sometimes but it moves fast and it is definitely worth it"
,,,,,"Located at the entrance of Pike Place market this little gem faces the busy cobblestone street where cars turn to enter the market. The store stands out with visible signage and clean display of various yogurt options with a number of yummy toppings. On first glance though I thought we were in for a frozen treat but instead the selections were a creamy soft display of a healthier variety. At a Yelp event I was offered a prepacked cup of key lime yogurt that was already packed with a dash of granola. As a side I decided to try their fresh apple yogurt to go. The difference between the two offerings were like night and day. The prepackaged key lime yogurt was thick with a key lime flavor and would be a great breakfast option, it was good but not something I would go out of my way to purchase at a store. However, the fresh, small cup of apple yogurt costing $5.25 appears pricey for the amount at first however at first full taste you realize why. There were fresh diced apples with brown sugar and bit of crumble mixed with smooth, creamy fresh yogurt. The combination of tart and subtly sweet really hit the spot. This is the perfect treat while on an afternoon walk or a snack to pack home for later. I truly enjoyed the fresh yogurt with the fresh fruits. In my opinion if this company were to have another event they should offer their fresh yogurts instead of the prepackaged cup. There is a world of difference between the two tastes."
,,,,,"Stopped by to try their new pike place collection flavors. Coconut cream pie, key lime pie, and apple crisp. Wasn't a huge fan of the key lime but the other two are delicious. I don't even like coconut and it was so good!! Recommend going here for delicious yogurt"
,,,,,Hooked to this place! Visited both on the first and the last day of my Seattle trip! Would definitely recommend for anyone in the Pike place area. Staff were friendly and helpful with recommendations!
,,,,,"Delicious Greek yogurt at a good price and with lots of delicious flavors to pick from. I forgot the list of sizes available but I got the cup for $5, which honestly looked small but for yogurt is plenty! It filled me up. "
,,,,,"My favorite is the ube yogurt. My pet peeve is when someone turns something purple and call it ube but tastes nothing like it. This is probably one of the most ube-est tasting items I've ever had. What a healthy, delicious treat that's easy on the stomach and health."
,,,,,So many flavors and sooo delicious!
,,,,,We had the marrionberry pie flavor- so so yummy.
,,,,,"A little bit on the pricey side, but most things in Seattle are. Worth it though!"
,,,,,Such a simple and fun way to grab some morning Greek yogurt in the morning. Right at the PikePlace Market.

,,,,,So delicious. So much sugar. In fact let me write a Haiku:
,,,,,Amazing flavors
,,,,,"Creamy, so sweet, oh my god"
,,,,,I've got the 'Beetus
,,,,,"Don't kid yourself, this isn't health food, but oh my is it a lovely treat."
,,,,,"Thank you for your feedback!  I'm happy to share that our Plain Unsweetened (sometimes also called Natural) flavor has no added sugar, and about 9g of inherent sugar per serving.  I personally love it with fresh berries and a drizzle of local honey!  We also just launched our new Milk + Fruit line, which gets its sweetness from only the Milk + Fruit with zero added sugar (about 11-13 grams of sugar per 5.3oz cup).  At this time, you can find our new flavors: pineapple ginger, cherry vanilla, fig raisin, and apple cinnamon at participating Whole Foods Market stores in the greater Seattle area!"
,,,,,Ellenos greek yogurt is a must go place at pike place. I have tried the marionberry flavor and mango yogurt both are smooth and delicious.
,,,,,"When I go to the market (Pike Place Market), I don't go to see the sights or the throwing fish, I go DIRECTLY to Ellenos. The fresh yogurt has a wide variety of flavors that always compliment my craving. My personal favorite is the Pumpkin Pie that they only have during the fall. 10/10 would recommend!"
,,,,,"Had to leave a little update to say the Olive Oil & Pink Salt flavor is so strange, but sooo delicious. If you're a fan of salty and sweet, you need to try it. :-)"
,,,,,"I am a huge Greek yogurt fan and keeping seeing Ellenos yogurt at all the grocery stores around here (I'm not from here, so it's completely new to me)!! I found out about this shop through Yelp and was so excited to try it. "
,,,,,"For only $5, you are able to get a ""walk around"" yogurt, which is just about the perfect size. They have unique flavors to choose from and you can add multiple into your cup (I tried four). My favorite was the Key Lime Pie and my boyfriend's was the Marionberry Pie. The Carrot Cake and Orange Turmeric were also fantastic. "
,,,,,"Overall, this place is worth the money and won't disappoint. I'd highly recommend it to anyone!"
,,,,,"Ellenos is amazing! A must try in Seattle! The pike place shop has a ton of intriguing flavors and they move the line very quickly! However, this is not your typical Greek yogurt with toppings. This yogurt is very rich, sweet, and filling. It is extremely creamy and I would consider it more of a dessert than a yogurt but delicious nonetheless!"
,,,,,"Ellenos is a Seattle staple. A trip to Pike Place Market isn't complete without a stop here. I pretty much live off of Greek yogurt, so I'm like a kid in a candy store here. It's like an ice cream shop for Greek yogurt with several flavors behind the counter and the option to taste them before choosing. The yogurt is rich and creamy and makes for a perfect snack/treat while exploring the market. Passionfruit is one of my favorites."
,,,,,"My absolute favorite yogurt of all time. To me, this is as good as it gets! I love all of their flavors but I have to say the passion fruit and seasonal key lime are my two top favorite flavors. Something about that extra tartness that really hits home. The yogurt is super creamy and thick and the flavored yogurts are at the perfect level of sweetness for me. "
,,,,,"I love that Ellenos is now more widely available now at stores like Whole Foods/QFC/PCC, and even Costco. While I love the counters, it's not always an easy trip for me."
,,,,,So good. This is basically dessert that you can feel good about eating because it's Greek Yogurt. It's so creamy and the flavors are fun and unique.
,,,,,"I love to walk around the market with a scoop of coffee yogurt. My other go to is Vanilla Bean. I'm not a lemon fan, but my sister raves about their Lemon Curd. "
,,,,,This is a great snack and so Seattle.
,,,,,It's like the best yogurt ever! I actually buy their yogurt and will have it as dessert. The unsweetened Greek yogurt I will have for breakfast. Really an excellent product.
,,,,,"The best yogurt out there! I've been to the Ellenos at Pikes Place multiple times during every season, and buy their products in-store and at Costco often. I love going to the Pikes Place location and seeing all of the flavors in the window. Everyone who works there is so friendly and inviting, and will help you choose a flavor if you can't decide. I used to not be a fan of Greek yogurt, but Ellenos definitely changed that."
,,,,,"My all time favorite is the Passionfruit that includes real passionfruit seeds. It tastes both sweet and sour, but the perfect amount of both. This year, I also tried out the Key Lime and Pumpkin seasonal flavors, and those quickly became two of my faves. I wish these could be year long flavors!"
,,,,,"If you're ever in the Pikes Place Market area, I highly recommend stopping by and grabbing some yogurt. They offer to-go cups as well as different sizes to take home, so that you can enjoy while walking around downtown, or take them home to enjoy!"
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"All the other 5 star reviews pretty much sum it up. I'm just here to recommend you guys try the Olive Oil & Pink Salt flavor. I know it sounds weird!! BUT, hear me out. It's frickin delicious. If you don't believe me, you can always try a sample of it. Also the Mango flavor is bomb too :)"
,,,,,Ellenos makes a quality product. It's rich and flavorful. When you buy it from their stand it's fun too. They add the fruits you want as a topping and it's a pleasure watching them do it while you're sauntering about in the market.
,,,,,"If you have not had at Ellenos Real Greek yogurt, you might not want to start. It is so outstanding. I can't get over the lemon curd, I have had a marionberry and it was just as good. A real treat"
,,,,,"I was lucky enough to get my hands on this LIMITED EDITION Brownie Batter Yogurt, and let's all hope that this flavor changes to an UNLIMITED EDITION flavor  - it's THAT good. It's the good ole classic delicious Ellenos (vanilla?) yogurt, with some fudge chocolate on the bottom and you sprinkle some crunchy chocolate cookie bits on top. This is the perfect dessert yogurt, when you're looking for something chocolaty but not too sweet!"
,,,,,"I've never really considered Greek yogurt as a dessert. I've always thought it's more of a healthy breakfast/snack, but this place definitely count as a cute dessert place!"
,,,,,"I got the walkaround size with the huckleberry pie and lemon cheesecake flavors. I like the huckleberry pie more because it's on the sweater side. The sour from the lemon is a little overpowering when combined with the sour from the yogurt itself. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it! One flavor that I got to try and deserve a shoutout is also the olive oil one, it tasted kind of like vanilla and was delicious!"
,,,,,This idea is such a novel idea and I haven't seen it in other big cities (yet). I'll definitely be coming back whenever I'm in town.
,,,,,"Located right in front of the big main Public Market Center entrance, be prepared for crowds. If you really want to avoid them you can come 10-ish minutes before opening time. On a Friday morning this place had a little line already forming opening. The shop is very small but there were quite a few flavors to choose from (more than 10 for sure). They will let you sample before deciding, which I always appreciate! I ended up trying the Marionberry pie and the strawberry (shortcake?) but went with the Marionberry pie. It tastes similar to blueberry. Loved the little crunchy pie crumbles, which provided added texture. Thought that my size container was the smallest size available but they actually have a size smaller, like a little cup that would have been easier to carry around. Would get that next time. A tasty, healthy snack/breakfast amongst all the other fatty foods I've been having on this Seattle trip. Not ice cream level good, but a good option if you're feeling something light and more health conscious."
,,,,,Went here to pick up my Yelp good for a Yelp Elite event and really enjoyed the Key Lime Pie Greek Yoghurt.. i can see myself eating this once a week if not more.. the greek yoghurt is definitelt high quality.. the only reason I reduced a star was for the amount of added sugar per container this has.. if folks are watching their sugar then please read the nutritional facts before consuming this or consider this a cheat day (like I did) this place is always crowded and I never noticed to stop by as I was always rushing to the flower market or some other eateries down there.. highly recommend giving these guys a try - Trust me you will love it!
,,,,,"This is really good stuff. I wonder how healthy it is, but it is delicious. If you come to Seattle, you need to stop and try some."
,,,,,Great flavors and took me by surprise. I didn't think Greek yogurt would be worth all the hype but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and freshness. Super happy about the decision to get Lemon Curd and Marionberry Pie - they were awesome!
,,,,,"I personally do really enjoy their yogurts, but I can't generally justify it. I would say this is great if you're looking for something healthier than Ice Cream to walk around with. "
,,,,,"The yogurt is creamy and smooth, but also nice and thick so it coats my mouth nicely. I personally love their Marion Berry flavor (one of their classics). It's a little tart, and wonderfully sweet, and just wonderful  to complement the fattyness of the yogurt. "
,,,,,"Service is a great, friendly and very quick. "
,,,,,"I would say overall, It's a great idea and probably good for new years resolutions, but I'm not sure if I'd really splurge on this on a regular basis. There are other amazing yogurts out there. This one is a bit too pricey for my consumption."
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Their yogurt is really good. 
,,,,,"It more just like a regular greek yogurt, not a frozen yogurt. "
,,,,,I personally liked passionfruit. I was told marionberry and passionfruit are their two most popular flavors.
,,,,,"It's almost like an ice cream shop here, except with healthier Greek yogurt.  Just like ice cream, you can mix scoops with different flavors.  I mixed a strawberry cheesecake Greek yogurt with a chai Greek yogurt.  You would think they do not go together, but they tasted just fine next to each other.  Best of all, I like how Ellenos has a walk-around cup size, where you can just consume the deliciousness right away after leaving the stand!"
,,,,,I had a cup of mango and passion fruit. The yogurt was dense; I liked it. The place is located at the entrance of pike market.
,,,,,"While the pictures I have are of a new yogurt flavor of theirs I didn't necessarily like, in general I have loved pretty much every other flavor in the book! Their yogurt tastes very full, rich and creamy and most of all fresh. It has a natural essence you can only get from quality yogurt."
,,,,,"I think my favorite part of this staple in pikes place market is all of the unique, well thought out flavor combinations that you don't find in grocery stores!"
,,,,,"Gluten free friendly, and no credit card fee!"
,,,,,"I have to say... Greek yogurt is never that usual suspect on my list of places to try out when it comes to a market eating frenzy. But Ellenos is a repeater for me when it comes to Pike Market. The yogurt is smooth, rich, and creamy. On top of which, you get to choose your toppings from a full line up of seasonal and classic items - with our favorites being ube and passion fruit. Be it breakfast, light lunch, or simply an afternoon snack, Ellenos will satisfy that craving!"
,,,,,"PS: you can get Ellenos at certain markets around  town, including Amazon to-go!"
,,,,,Actually really bomb. Love the concept of selling yogurt in a cup like one would for ice cream. The flavors are all diverse as well. Tried strawberry cream and it comes with little graham bits which is so important honestly. And service is so sweet and patient.
,,,,,OMG!! This is the bomb! So creamy and smooth. 
,,,,,"Normally get super bloated and sick when eating yogurt. I'm severely lactose intolerant. Surprisingly enough after having a huge portion here, I had no symptoms!! The quality of the ingredients is definitely approved by my sensitive stomach!"
,,,,,"Got 2 different flavors and both were soooo amazing! The yogurt is sooo thick and smooth, I was surprised that yogurt could taste this good! I definitely don't need to eat ice cream anymore. "
,,,,,Highly recommend!
,,,,,"Such a fun Pike Place classic and perfect breakfast item. I got the Marion berry and it was super tasty, almost too much flavor that by the time I had half of the cup it was too much. Not that it was bad at all, just the flavors are rich. The workers here are super nice and helpful and let you sample any flavor so definitely take advantage of that because there are so many interesting flavors that you'll want to try before ordering!!"
,,,,,I really enjoy Ellenos and often buy their yogurts in stores. The Marion berry and passion fruit are two of my faves.
,,,,,I loved walking around Pike place with a small cup of their yogurt pre-covid days. But alas.
,,,,,You have to try their pumpkin pie flavor if you haven't already. It takes so so good!
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"If you find yourself in the heart of Pike place market surrounded by tons of people taking photos Ellenos is a great place to grab a snack. I originally thought it was frozen yogurt but quickly realized it was much closer to a breakfast style. They sell the individual cups for home but have well over a dozen different flavors for sale at the Pike place stand. I tried three different ones and they were all so full of flavor and delicious! Key lime pie, apple crisp and coconut. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other specialty ones, mango looked amazing. The staff was also super friendly, which is very out of the ordinary for the hustle and bustle of the market."
,,,,,"So many flavors!!! This season, my favorite is apple crumble! Perfect balance between sweet apple and cinnamon  Also the customer service here is always top tier. I really wish they start expanding to other states like CA because I cannot believe I grew up withouth Ellenos :P"
,,,,,"This yogurt is a taste of heaven!!! It is expensive and worth every penny. It blows other store bought brands out of the water. I'm lucky enough to have tried it at the Pike Place Market, where they are super nice and friendly, and will happily give you samples to try. I've tried about a third of the flavors, and so far the mango and passion fruit flavors are my favorites. I buy a container from Uwajimaya every time I go to the store. I would never think to eat yogurt as a dessert, but I do treat myself to Ellenos after dinner often. Underneath the lid, you will find the family name and I literally bless them before I take my first bite. I'm moving soon and this yogurt is in the top 10 things I will miss!!"
,,,,,You've never really had Greek yogurt until you have it from Ellenos. Hands down this place blows away most any Greek yogurt you've ever bought in a supermarket.
,,,,,"This was another one of our visits during our Pike Place Market food tour. It's located on one of the outside vendor rows of the market, and on a beautiful day made for a perfect treat in the sunshine. "
,,,,,I had to try the Marionberry as it was a flavor I never heard of. This was so good. I love any yogurt with berries and this was right up my alley. Highly recommend you hit them up if at the market.
,,,,,Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt is known as the best greek yogurt place in Seattle.  It is also one of the popular spots to visit at Pike Place Market.
,,,,,"As it has become very popular, Ellenos greek yogurt is now available in many local grocery stores like Safeway, QFC, PCC, Whole Foods, etc.  A real benefit of getting yogurts directly from the Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt shop is a wide variety of selection you can choose from.  "
,,,,,"This time, I tried a pumpkin pie limited edition, a marionberry, and a passion fruit.  They all tasted very good - as you may have heard, Ellenos greek yogurt has its own uniqueness - slightly different from typical greek yogurts you may have had so far.  Ellenos greek yogurt doesn't have the strong smell of typical greek yogurt.  The texture of it is a bit more creamy."
,,,,,"When I saw all of the recommendations for Ellenos and the 5 star reviews, I thought something was up. Like, what could be so special about Greek yogurt. Not frozen yogurt, but Greek yogurt... a breakfast snack at that."
,,,,,"Well, to my surprise, I walked past Ellenos several times as I was getting pictures of the Pike Public Market sign. I stopped for a moment and saw it, and I had to go over, to figure out what the hype was about! "
,,,,,"Because of Covid, many restaurants are not offering samples any more, but Ellenos is still offering samples safely -- with a spoon, and a small sample cup. The employees were very helpful and friendly! The flavors aren't too extreme, and the fruit flavors are great accompaniments to the yogurt. I tried the lemon curd and chai, and I fell in love with the chai yogurt. I ordered the small for $5.25. It had hints of cinnamon and the sweetness was a perfect balance with the tart yogurt. "
,,,,,"Now why are people flocking in droves to Ellenos and raving about Greek yogurt? Well, because the yogurt is so thick and flavorful, it's hard to believe you're eating healthy-ish Greek yogurt. I just learned that not only is Ellenos sold at the stall in Pike Place and the airport, but they are sold retail across the U.S., fingers crossed that I can find it in Louisiana."
,,,,,"This place is amazing. At first look, you might be disappointed to see all those beautiful tubs are yogurt and not ice cream. Once you start tasting the flavors, the disappointment is replaced with awe. Who knew yogurt could taste so good?! It's decadent and feels like dessert. "
,,,,,"Everyone at the shop was so friendly and encouraged me to try as many flavors as I wanted- i wish I had tried more and bought more! I tried lemon curd, passion fruit, chai, Marionberry with a crumble...I feel like I tried more but I cannot remember. They were all so good! I bought a small container of the lemon curd- i think that was my favorite."
,,,,,"Next time I'm up here, I will stock up on more- I have already purchased the lemon curd and passionfruit from my Neighborhood Safeway store. I live supporting local businesses, especially when they have amazing service and products."
,,,,,Giving this a 5 star not because it's exceptional or the most amazing thing you'll ever have but because they do one thing and they do it well. I'm not a huge yogurt fan but this tasted good and matched every expectation I had of it.
,,,,,Typical tourist trap in Pike Market. I must say Try once to experience the yogurt and you can say I been there and done that at least. I paid $5.25 for a single scoop of yogurt with berry flavor. It was OK. There was NO wow factor.
,,,,,"Hi there!  Thank you for giving us a try!  We are sorry to hear that our Marionberry flavor didn't give you the Ellenos WOW! we were going for.  We truly appreciate hearing your feedback.  If you'd like to give us another shot by trying a different flavor, we'd be happy to make it up to you.  Please feel free to email us at "
,,,,,.  Have a wonderful day!
,,,,,Love the flavors here. Marion berry pie and matcha were amazing! I wish I had more time and stomach space to enjoy all the flavors

,,,,,"I love yogurt, I eat a lot of it, and Ellenos is quality yogurt. It's super creamy and with a wide variety of flavors -- exactly the type of thing you'd miss if you were to become lactose intolerant. "
,,,,,"I've been here several times now, and it's got me thinking: Why aren't yogurt bars a bigger trend? They should be. The line, if there is one, is usually short and pretty fast. I went around two weeks ago and got the Olive Oil & Sea Salt flavor, which is my favorite yet. I love salt in any application, and this hit that perfect note of creamy, subtly salty, and tart. Right now, they also have their seasonal pumpkin pie flavor! They also do samples, which is great when you're indecisive like me (not sure about sampling right now during COVID)."
,,,,,"I do find that several of their flavors veer on the sweeter side, like the cheesecake ones, and those aren't for me. It's a bit pricey for a small cup, but when I compare it to a scoop of ice cream, it's worth if you like yogurt (as you should). For me, it's a permanent stop on the many Pike Place tours you bring your friends on when they visit Seattle for the first time."
,,,,,"I'm not a huge fan of green yogurt but the yogurt here is delicious. It's rich, thick, and creamy with only a hint of sourness. I tried the coconut cream pie flavor and it had the perfect amount of coconut with a sprinkling of graham cracker crust crumbs. They have many other flavor to try as well. It's right outside the famous public market center sign, so you can't miss it."
,,,,,"The people here are friendly, and you always feel welcomed here!"
,,,,,Was able to try their fall flavors and I forgot how good Ellenos is! I usually get Ellenos at the Ballard's farmers market but with COVID haven't been able to go there. It's also a must when your friends are visiting Seattle if they haven't tried it.
,,,,,"The great news is that they have Ellenos in the supermarkets, at Whole Foods, and at Amazon Go so you can get your fix! I absolutely loved the passion fruit flavor (still one of my go-tos). Was lucky to take part of a Yelp Elite virtual event to meet the founder, and I'm so glad that how Ellenos as a business projects itself to its customers is how the founder is as well!"
,,,,,"I will definitely be supporting Ellenos in the future. Also, it's a plus if your yogurt tastes like dessert!"
,,,,,"Busy Saturday at Pike, but line moved quick. Got Matcha blueberry & lemon blueberry- both were fresh & delicious it was a nice afternoon treat. Social distancing protocols were followed and service was friendly."
,,,,,I don't love greek yogurt. I don't even like greek yogurt and I liked this. If you can make me like something I don't like? Winner winner. Stop by when you're at the market.
,,,,,My husband and I visited Seattle for a weekend and wanted to try as many as the popular Pike Place foods as possible. Ellenos was on the list and was by far some of the best yogurt we had ever had! I love berries so decided to try the Marionberry which was tart and sweet! My
,,,,,Husband had the lemon curd and loved it!
,,,,,Got their Lemon Cheesecake yogurt in a Walkaround cup ($5.25) and it was so good! So thick and creamy that I had to save half for later (thank you to the server who gave me a separate lidded container when I ordered!) 
,,,,,"I sampled the Apple Cinnamon, Huckleberry and this one, and for the Lemon Cheesecake, I couldn't taste any of the yogurt, unlike the others. Very unique and a good alternative to an actual cheesecake slice."
,,,,,"Definitely recommend trying some if you're in the area, or asking for a few samples if you're on the fence!"
,,,,,"Limited parking nearby, but I also went on a weekday and when it was raining so I was able to get a spot."
,,,,,"Ellenos is is a little hard to spot as you walk down Pike, as there is no big sign out front. They are located just east of the big fruit stand on the corner of Pike Street and the entrance to the market. But once you know where it is, this yogurt stand is not to be missed. The women serving the yogurt were so nice and friendly. I sampled 3 flavors: apple crisp, coconut, and key lime pie. All were delicious, but I was really digging the cinnamon crumbles on top of the apple crisp yogurt. Yum! I'm looking forward to returning to try more flavors, including mango and chai!"
,,,,,I loved Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt and wished that they had a restaurant in Central Florida. The yogurt was super fresh and creamy. It is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. 
,,,,,They have lots of mix in flavors that enhance the taste of the yogurt instead of overwhelming it. The person working the line of customers was very friendly and offered suggestions. There are four sizes to choose from.  We picked the walk around size and thought that it was plenty for one person.
,,,,,"Favorite place in Seattle. I always come for this. Their regular with honey is amazing, as is their Marionberry. The walking size is plenty large and reasonably priced. High quality, full fat European Greek yogurt."
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Yum!! One of my favorite brands of yogurt! I was so surprised to see them here!
,,,,,"Its Greek yogurt, but I can't tell  it's so rich and thick!! I love it! A real treat! The have tins of flavors, and ""pie"" version of some. Comes with crumb topping. So good!!"
,,,,,"They have multiple sizes. We got the ""walk"" around kind. They even let us mix flavors! Super nice staff"
,,,,,"Super delicious and creamy! High in calories though, but worth it if you're looking for a high protein snack that's sweet!"
,,,,,"This easily became a favorite of mine while visiting Seattle. It was interesting to see a yogurt scooping station and after that first taste it put the typical ice cream scooping places to shame. There were so many flavors and you can stack up the flavors,  so throughout the weekend I got double scoops! My absolute favorite was the Marionberry Pie. The crumble pieces mixed made it even better. "
,,,,,"Whenever there was a line, it moved fairly quickly and you can try samples too if you're undecided. The staff was really friendly and gave wonderful suggestions whenever we asked. "
,,,,,Thanks for keeping my gut healthy throughout my Seattle trip!
,,,,,"So many flavors! I wish they sold them all at the stores! I love that it's ice cream style, so fun and so many different kinds to choose from. We got the Marionberry pie and the key lime pie and they were so good. I get why the lines can be so long!"
,,,,,"My absolute favorite spot to a sweet treat in Pike Place! Whenever I'm in Seattle, I am sure to get my fix at Ellenos because the flavors are unlike the ones you can grab at the grocery store. Most recently, I snagged their Marionberry Pie which is their classic Marionberry flavor topped with pie crumbles and their Chai which had a light cinnamon-y flavor. Ellenos never disappoints!!"
,,,,,"This place has the best Greek yogurt I've ever had, I honestly don't know why it's so good but once you've had it, you definitely want to get more. I tried the mixed berry flavor and it was great."
,,,,,"I love Ellenos so much. I first tried their yogurt when I found it in a Whole Foods in CA. Ever since then I've been wanting to visit the real thing and I was not disappointed! I tried the Marrionberry Pie flavor and it was sooo good. Definitely a more dessert type yogurt, but it's seriously so amazing. I'd move to Seattle just for this yogurt."
,,,,,"Best yogurt around. I love their Marion berry cheese cake flavor, or their lemon bar flavor. This is a good place to go if you're on a diet but still crave something delicious and sweet."
,,,,,Best freaking Greek yogurt in the world. It's like the gold standard of yogurts! I crave it all the time and it's been 5 years since I've been to Seattle. I'm so glad they ship now . I just wish there were more flavors available.
,,,,,"I can't say enough good things about Ellenos. The consistency of the yogurt, uniqueness of flavors, and friendly staff make this a must-visit every time I swing by Pike Place. I also love that you can get the yogurt locally at grocery stores and use the opportunity of getting a Walkaround (2 flavors, in an open cup) to try new flavors. The staff is super friendly too and let you sample a bunch before committing! If it's your first time, you won't go wrong with marionberry."
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,They allow you to sample. It's easy to offer. The Lemon cheesecake was delicious and very filling!
,,,,,"We got a cup of the marionberry pie, and let me tell you this is the best yogurt I've ever had. The crunchiness of the pie crust and the fruitiness of the berry blended perfectly with the yogurt. It's not too sweet but it's still full of flavor. The portion is perfect for sharing, or for yourself by all means. They also do split flavor if you'd like."
,,,,,"I love this Greek yogurt.  Before they started popping up in delis and grocery stores, I craved this all the time because it was never convenient for me to go to their locations. I love passion fruit. It is my go to.  The flavor is so good, slightly tart and it's so creamy. Slightly pricier than other yogurt. If it wasn't I would buy it to eat weekly. "
,,,,,"The only thing I don't like is this location is jammed packed, not really any parking. So unless your already in the area, hard to get to."
,,,,,I love the Greek yogurt here and all the flavors! The line goes by quickly as well so it never a long wait
,,,,,"I absolutely adore Ellenos yogurt. I have not been able to find another yogurt as rich yet not overly thick (example: Fage). Somehow Ellenos is able to make a perfectly textured Greek yogurt that is decadent and versatile. It has become my favorite yogurt in the Seattle area. All major grocery stores in the area (Safeway, Whole Foods, PCC and Met Market) carry pre-packaged containers in such a wide variety, including the seasonal flavors! It's such a treat. I've been able to find Ellenos in the Bay Area as well but the selection and size options are much more limited, so take advantage of the options in store if you live in the Seattle area! "
,,,,,"Enough about the grocery store options though.... The stand has soooo many more options than even the best stocked grocery store. They have more ""crunchy"" options such as Marion berry pie, which is just the Marion berry yogurt with some cookie crumble. I usually get a textured option when I'm here since they are seriously amazing. If I don't get that, I'll get something I can't get in the store since it feels more special to me. "
,,,,,"I do want to add that you should be careful about the sugar content in the yogurt. The taste of the yogurt is comparable to ice cream because the sugar content is comparable!!! If you're sugar sensitive, try their unsweetened option, which is actually the one I get the most often since I buy that one at the store. It's still extremely delicious and works best with granola and fruit since it doesn't overwhelm the flavor with the sweetness. I wish the unsweetened option was available in a large tub in the Bay Area.... Hint hint, Ellenos!"
,,,,,"I've been seeing this yogurt all over Instagram, so when I found out that they originated in Seattle, I knew I wanted to stop by when I visited."
,,,,,"They had a variety of flavors, but I ultimately chose their marionberry because I don't think I've had that before. I already eat greek yogurt from the market, so I was happy with this one freshly made one. The berry was nice and tart, and although it looked like it blanketed over most of the yogurt, I actually could have done with more of the marionberry. I wanted to try their lemon curd one as well, but since I was visiting, I didn't have the stomach space/time for it. Maybe I'll visit the market and see if those are just as good since their products are available at Whole Foods."
,,,,,OK so usually I would give this place 5 stars in a heartbeat - no hesitation. And usually when I come there are two young men at the counter. Super friendly and generous servers.
,,,,,"But today, an older blonde woman helped me. I ordered two medium yogurts. Now tell me why before she put the lid on one of my mediums she took an entire spoonful out and put it back in the serving container???? LMAOO the audacity - I was so close to reaching over the glass like ""aht aht  it's one spoonful put it back ma'am""  why did she do me dirty like that #traumatized "
,,,,,No but being serious when I got home I realized mine was very full and if she kept that spoonful it would've overflowed and made a mess so thank you ma'am  anyway this place is great I love yogurt and I come here at least once a month
,,,,,The yogurt here is in a league of it's own and taste fantastic.  Can now find it in stores around WA.
,,,,,"The location is a great spot at Pike Place Market, it was easy to find. Even though it was 90 degrees it was a cool option to eat. I had the Key Lime Pie yogurt, it was just how I like it! It was creamy and firm in taste. "
,,,,,"I had the ""walk"" size which is a good size option if you are new to Greek yogurt. Plus it does come in a nice cup with the name for photo ops :) "
,,,,,"If the line looks long, it does move fast so don't be intimidated by the line."
,,,,,After eating all around pike's place I had to get dessert at the end. 
,,,,,I love Greek yogurt so it's cool that they have many flavors to pick from. I got passion fruit. It was sweet and not too tart . 
,,,,,The yogurt was very smooth and tasted fresh.

,,,,,I keep hearing about this place and finally got some! It actually lives up to the hype. I personally LOVE Greek yogurt. I got the Marion berry and it was delicious! It was tangy and sweet but not too sweet. It has the perfect amount of everything in there. It's also about $5.25 which i think is reasonably priced. My sister got the key lime pie and really enjoyed it. Everything was super good. Would definitely go back
,,,,,I was so bummed to find out Ellenos isn't open Monday and Tuesdays. I came to Seattle for a short trip and a friend highly recommended it. Luckily I was able to grab two small tubs before I left Wednesday morning. I asked the server what their most popular flavors are (passion fruit and Marion berry). I decided to go with Marion berry and couldn't resist the lemon cheesecake one too. 
,,,,,I preferred the lemon cheesecake one. It has the texture from the crunch of the cheesecake crumble. I would've brought an entire large tub back home with me if I could. 
,,,,,"It's located near the ""Pike public market"" sign. Do yourself a favor and try it even if you're not a Greek yogurt fan typically. It's that good!!"
,,,,,When I first heard about this place I thought it had to be overhyped just because it's RIGHT by Pike Place Market. But I tried this one day and oh my god it absolutely blew me away. The texture was perfect; the yogurt was smooth with just the right amount of chunkiness and perfect amount of chocolate bars added in. A pretty generous serving as well. Delightful staff as well. So happy they sell these in stores because I can't wait to stock my fridge up!
,,,,,"Wow, I'm glad I didn't skip this place. This yogurt was delicious and no line either!! I got the marionberry pie and it was like eating ice cream, soo tasty!! Will definitely recommend people to visit this place when in Seattle!"
,,,,,"Okay Ramy eyed this place and was excited to go all afternoon. We ordered caramel twist (this had some nice crunchy bits) and Om Ali (Ramy is from Egypt and was so excited to see this flavor). We were trying to find somewhere to stop and enjoy our yogurts but with all the COVID restrictions, we ended up toting our yogurts around for twenty minutes before ending up in front of the yogurt shop, eating our yogurts while standing."
,,,,,"By this time, our yogurts were still cold but were not frozen. We were just eating flavored yogurt--this obviously is not the shop's fault, but it would be nice if there was a sitting area inside the market or out on the street where this shop is. We definitely want to return to try this Om Ali yogurt while it's still frozen!"
,,,,,"There's a reason why Ellenos had 5 stars. It's just the best yogurt and dessert. After my first visit to Seattle, I became obsessed and needed to figure out how to get it in the a Bay Area. Lucky they now sell them in Whole Foods! But nothing compares to eating it fresh in Seattle and all the fun flavors. The matcha blueberry and passion fruit are my favorite. You can't leave Seattle without coming here first!"
,,,,,First Stop for Handcrafted Yogurt what a treat! Found this on YELP and could not believe I did not know it was right at the corner all this time.  
,,,,,Picked up the Walk Around size which was perfect and the flavors wow could not decide what to choose. I did choose the Marion Berry and also friends tried the Passion Fruit. Loved It! 
,,,,,hopefully soon we can travel back to Seattle and stop here again
,,,,,"Thanks to a Yelp event, I had the opportunity to try Ellenos.  Now they have a new fan!"
,,,,,"I've tried unsweetened, lemon, vanilla bean, passion fruit, pumpkin pie (limited) and Marion berry.  "
,,,,,"Yes, they have a wonderful product."
,,,,,It's delicious and creamy.
,,,,,"If you're looking for a healthy, lower sugar, clean ingredient yogurt, this is it!"
,,,,,"It's not sold in many stores.  As a result, I have to drive at least 30 minutes to find the closest place... Lazy Acres, Whole Foods, Gelson's and Pavilion have it on their shelves."
,,,,,I finished my stash.
,,,,,Off to get more!
,,,,,"If you like Greek yogurt.. come here. If you're lactose intolerant, take a lactaid and do it! Even my boyfriend liked it and got his own pint when he never likes Greek yogurt. "
,,,,,The seasonal strawberry shortcake flavor was absolutely delicious. I also tried the passion fruit and that was good too! I'm so jealous of those who live in the Pacific Northwest as the Costco's have Ellenos and same with other grocery stores.
,,,,,Obsessed with Greek yogurt so this was my personal heaven. They have so many delicious flavors and I can't believe this hasn't caught on across the country. The Marionberry pie flavor I tried was so good I came back later the same week to get it again. The workers are super nice and let you sample as many flavors as you want!
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Ellenos might just be one of my favorite vendors at Pike Place. Their Greek yogurt is tart, thick, and creamy, and it's mixed with a huge selection of different flavorings and toppings, so you can really never get bored! Their Marionberry pie might be their most popular, but I was especially partial to the De Laurenti, which was Greek yogurt mixed with aromatic vanilla in the base, and paired with olive oil and pink salt, which added a deep savoriness that accentuated the flavors of both the vanilla and the olive oil. I was also a fan of the passionfruit, which had a balanced fruity, sweet, and tart flavor that balanced out the creaminess of the yogurt. The server here was extremely generous with offering samples, so I was really able to taste many different versions before settling on my favorites!"
,,,,,"I have never really been much of a yogurt fan but Ellenos has completely won me over with their Greek Yogurt. Built on family passion, locally sourced ingredients, smooth and creamy texture, well balanced flavors (nice blend of sweet and tart), this is quality yogurt that you can trust. "
,,,,,"I have been to their Pike Place location and purchased cups from local grocery stores, and the taste never disappoints. Among the flavors I've tried (lemon curd, marionberry, and passion fruit), passion fruit remains my favorite!"
,,,,,Not really much to say aside from the fact that you must give them a try!
,,,,,"Um, yummmm. And, yes!!! I love the flavor options (and creativity behind them) and the smooth Greek yogurt that Ellenos offers. Their service is also top notch. And, I love love love that they'll refill your clean glass container (when it's not covid, and dad to do so)!! "
,,,,,Thanks to the great team at the scoop shop today who offered tastings and patiently answered all of my questions. So excited to have a healthy option for a sweet treat when I visit the market. 
,,,,,"P.S. Ellenos, maybe you can switch to compostable spoons for samples instead of single-use plastics ones??"
,,,,,The first thing me & the gf got to eat in Seattle!
,,,,,We got to Pikes as soon as we got our rental car & thought we'd be getting some chowder first or maybe even Beechers but those lines were so long & we just wanted to get something asap.
,,,,,Item's ordered:
,,,,,"Ellenos was of course on our must get list & when we walked by the line was not that bad so we decided to hop in. We already knew we were getting marionberry pie & finally were able to pick our 2nd choice, key lime pie."
,,,,,Taste:
,,,,,Didn't know what to really expect since I get Greek yogurt from the store pretty often but I knew this would be different. Both were very good & I'd get both flavors again.
,,,,,"The overall yogurt flavor is more subtle, less tart & a little sweeter than when you pick up the plain Greek yogurt at the grocery store. This  made for a pleasant, very enjoyable flavor as the base. "
,,,,,"Both fruit flavors came through well & the key lime pie flavor actually did bring back the flavors of key lime pie I've had back in Florida. We purposely chose these pie flavors since they had a ""crust"" topping mixed in & I'm a big fan of texture. This worked out well & made them kinda like parfaits. Honestly the addition of more ""crust"" as an option is the only real thing that would have made these better for me."
,,,,,The yogurt texture is for sure different than you get from the store. I'd say it's as thick as the Fage Greek yogurt brand. But it kind of has that stiff peak feel you get with whipped egg whites with a touch of what I'd call stickiness.
,,,,,Service & parking:
,,,,,"As I mentioned this was one of the shorter lines compared to other well known Pikes Place vendors. I should mention individual parties did not move that fast through the line since like when getting ice cream, many people wanted to sample flavors."
,,,,,Parking is exactly what Seattle parking is. If you get lucky you'll get some really close street parking. But if not there are structures nearby which are still close. Pretty sure it was $4 an hour which we ended up doing since we didn't want to waste our weekend searching for parking.
,,,,,Definitely plan on going back here when I'm back in Seattle. Hopefully they'll have some good seasonal flavors available.
,,,,,My family and I LOVE everything about Ellenos; it's local goodness that offers unique flavor combinations for everyone.  This is the only yogurt my almost 2 yr old will eat!
,,,,,The customer service at the Pike Place location is excellent; and a much larger variety than what's available in the area grocery stores. 
,,,,,"Now that Spring has come, if possible try to arrive very early to the market to avoid waiting in long lines."
,,,,,Sometimes I ask myself how I ended up relocating to such a wonderful place filled with amazing establishments like Ellenos that locally produce naturally good food; this hands down is the BEST Greek yogurt I've ever had!!!
,,,,,"This yogurt is extremely creamy, smooth, and filled with natural flavors from the listed ingredient (lemon, mango, Marionberry, vanilla bean, etc.) Every time we're at the market I make a point to stop by if they are open, but fortunately a vast variety of flavors are sold at Central Market."
,,,,,"My 1 year old will only eat Ellenos Vanilla Bean, and he absolutely knows the difference if you give him anything other than that."
,,,,,"If you're at the market definitely wait in line, or if spot Ellenos in the yogurt section at an area grocery grab a container you won't regret it!"
,,,,,"When I was pregnant 5 years ago, my OB recommended Ellenos for the taste and the protein. I use to get it at the grocery store and loved when I discovered it at the market. Today we stopped by and picked up some for our 97 year old grandma. We got her the apple and key lime"
,,,,,"Pie. Thanks to Yelp and Ellenos, they also gave us some Key Lime pie for us. So yummy! So refreshing to eat at the market/trip home. My daughter loves it!"
,,,,,Wonderful Greek Yogurt here right at the iconic Pike Place Market entrance. Great for insta photos!
,,,,,"I bought a Lemon Blueberry ""walk around"" and walked around while I ate it. Great healthy snack with lots of flavor varieties."
,,,,,Love coming back here when in the area. Give it a try!
,,,,,I stopped by the Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt location at the Pike Place Market a couple of days ago to pick up a tasting packet. At that same time I tasted some of the large variety of unique flavors at their counter. I love the Olive Oil & Sea Salt flavor for one. It reminds me of the Molly Moon Balsamic Strawberry ice cream flavor with the juxtaposition of savory and sweet flavors. Very delish!
,,,,,"I tried a few others but ended up selecting the Walk Around sized  Marionberry Pie flavor for $5.25 per cup. As I ""walked around"" the Market eating this delicacy, I really enjoyed the flavors and the rich creaminess of this Greek yogurt. I am a fan of the quality of the yogurt and the great mix of flavors they have. I like that this location has many standards and many unique flavors that aren't out yet in stores. "
,,,,,I love that Ellenos is now back at the Pike Place Market. They have a great location at the corner across from the iconic market sign and clock. 
,,,,,This yogurt is locally made in the area and is soooo yummy! Ya gotta try it!
,,,,,"Absurdly good, worth the hype. The yogurt is just slightly sweet on its own, and the toppings aren't too heavy. The marionberry pie and the passion fruit are perfect together (and you can get two flavors in one cup). If you're willing to get the small cup, you might as well get the medium, which is probably three times the size."
,,,,,This is quite literally green yogurt on steroids. Love that they have a huge variety of flavors to choose from and really don't skimp on the portions! This spot is a must stop for us every time we're in town and can absolutely guarantee you won't be disappointed. It's really a unique offering you won't find anywhere else!
,,,,,"A friend told me ""make sure you go and get Greek yogurt from Ellenos"", when he heard I was in Seattle. Ok, no problem but I was a bit skeptical as I am very picky with how good a Greek yogurt is."
,,,,,"Well, I am Greek so don't blame me for being kick, ok? :-)"
,,,,,"So, I found the Ellenos store abs had to take a few minutes to decide which flavors to get. "
,,,,,"Although I was a bit surprised that they didn't offer plain yogurt mixed with honey (a traditional staple in Greece), I found out that ALL flavors (with the exception of the plain) were already sweetened with honey. Decent ""compromise"" but I would have liked to see a yogurt sprinkled with honey and some walnuts on its own. "
,,,,,I sampled a few:
,,,,,Plain
,,,,,Olive oil/pink salt
,,,,,Pistachio 
,,,,,"I settled with one small cup of plain and one small cup of pistachio; I must say that the olive oil/pink salt combo was very good as well, quite intriguing."
,,,,,"First, the plain; it was what I expected from a good Greek yogurt. Nice, firm texture, enough tartness and great taste! "
,,,,,"Then, the pistachio: u-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-e ! I am not big on mixing stuff into the Greek yogurt but not sure what the people at Ellenos did, this was amazing. Enough pistachios to give you a decent mouthful but not overwhelming. It felt like eating yogurt with granola but even tastier! Totally recommended!"
,,,,,"So, final verdict; this Greek confirms that Ellenos Greek yogurt is fantastic, lots of flavors to choose from, a must if you are in the Pike Place Market abs want either a light snack and/or a healthy dessert."
,,,,,1500 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Finally able to try the brick & mortar store for my favorite greek yogurt.  Love the assortment of flavors and as always, the best tasting greek yogurt anywhere!  Love the texture and the mouthwatering flavors!"
,,,,,Thiccccc with all the c's in the world Ellenos really knows what they're doing when it comes to yogurt! 
,,,,,"I got the eat and walk option of marionberry and passionfruit and although I don't eat yogurt everyday, if I were to, it would be ellenos. Super thick and super creamy, I'm most likely going to have dreams about this fruity creamy treat. If you visit pikes market, definitely try this out!!"
,,,,,"If there's anything to envy about Seattle, it's that Ellenos is in their pocket. There are several brick and mortar locations; this one being the most famous, in Pike Place Market. "
,,,,,"There is obviously not really any place to park as this is located inside Pike Place Market - you'll have to park elsewhere and walk or take the bus here. As it is just a shop in a market there also isn't really anywhere to sit so this will be more of a to-go affair. The shop is located right next to the famous Pike Place Market sign where lots of people tend to take pictures so it'll likely be crowded, but makes for a nice place to take pictures yourself. "
,,,,,They offer a selection of different flavors which are fresh and innovative. They also have a selection of fresh fruits for you to buy. I tried the marionberry which was tart and sweet and excellent. 
,,,,,Ellenos is also offered in the Seattle area in various grocery stores. Obviously not as fresh and delicious as the real in store stuff but they're still pretty good if you can't make it to Pike Place Market.
,,,,,"I visited Ellenos at Pike Place a while ago, well before I enjoyed their yogurt at a Yelp Elite Event down in the Bay Area where I live. Although Ellenos is expanding all over the West Coast with a focused set of flavors and production methods that translate well to mass distribution, you can find dozens of flavors here at Pike Place that might not travel well and are therefore freshly, locally made."
,,,,,"I found the marionberry and the honey matcha blueberry absolutely delicious. Super creamy, luscious, and bursting with fresh, tangy, fruity ingredients. The yogurts come in a variety of sizes and my only regret was not getting at least a medium all to myself so I could jam more flavors into it. Some of their offerings are collabs with other Pike Place and PNW merchants, so I'd love to try their DeLaurenti olive oil & pink salt or their orange turmeric."
,,,,,"Service-wise, this a walk-up stand right in front of the Pike Place sign. They have stanchions set up to encourage distancing and proper queuing, and even if there's a wait, there are multiple staffers so things move along nicely."
,,,,,"The story behind Ellenos is super interesting. It all started when a Vancouver-based flight attendant discovered the yogurt that Alex and his dad were making in Australia. She tried to encourage them to expand to North America. Although they initially demurred, she was persistent in wooing them. Ultimately, many years later, they took her up on her offer, and this stand here at Pike Place is now as well-established and popular as other ones, many of which have been here for generations. ""Ellenos"" is their U.S. brand that honors both their Hellenic family heritage and their home down under in Oz."
,,,,,"Bonus: if you get to hear from Alex, you'll see how intoxicatingly alluring his Aussie accent is. Pure kryptonite from my perspective. ;)"
,,,,,"A must-have snack tucked into the famous Pike Place Market -- Ellenos serves high-quality, tasty Greek yoghurt! It's super easy to grab a cup and they have a carry-around size that's perfect for when you're walking around the market. "
,,,,,"The staff is super friendly and helpful and the flavors are SO! GOOD! I got the smallest size with a half-half of traditional with honey and marionberry pie -- the traditional was smooth and creamy without being too sweet which I loved, and the marionberry had little crumbles and tasted great as well. I also loved that you could do more than one favor. If you're stopping by Pike Place, do yourself a favor and grab some!"
,,,,,"Question for you: Why.Wouldn't.You.Buy.This.Every.Time? I use it as a dessert treat, topping with sliced almonds ... dragging up the flavored chunks bit by bit. A tall container lasts for 3 treats. No favorite flavor but I think Lemon is available year-round. The only thing I don't like about the container is the plastic lid doesn't always stay secure if the container is bumped when I put it back it the frig. Now, I put a 1/2 sheet of Viva towel on top so it doesn't come off."
,,,,,"Highly recommend for the quality! Buy local doesn't hurt, either."
,,,,,"We have been buying their passionfruit yogurt from whole foods, and decided to drop by the real shop to see their full selections. "
,,,,,"It's sitting by the main Pikes place entrance, so it's easy to find. There were so many favors on display, it could be hard to make up your mind which one to get! We got the mango and maion berry pie and they were delicious! The clerk gave us generous amount of yogurt, which almost filled to the rim! "
,,,,,"If you like Greek yogurt, definitely pay them a visit!"
,,,,,"If you are ever in Seattle, the Elleno's at Pike Place is a must!! Their fresh and delicious greek yogurt is a staple at Pike Place market. They offer so many delicious flavors that will want you craving for more. The marionberry pie is my favorite with the crunchy pie crust and the right sweetness that the marionberry adds. They sell these greek yogurt at the grocery stores in Seattle but they taste way better eating in store in my opinion. Please visit and support this local business:)"
,,,,,One of the best yogurt I've ever had! Will try again! Flavors are amazing! Passion fruit and mango soooooo good!
,,,,,I love ellenos! Even though I no longer live in Seattle I still think of this spot often. The creamy tangy yogurt will capture your palette like no other yogurt can. A visit to pike place is simply incomplete if you don't get some Ellenos.

,,,,,My favorite Greek Yogurt that I usually buy from Metropolitan market but since I live on 2nd and Pine we have here shop at Pike market. I just dont like to stand so big queues with tourists lol but I got lucky after 5 pm when I went to buy something at the market and yogurt place was empty. Me and hubby got rhubarb and blueberry. Rhubarb I guess its seasonal and I love rhubarb sooo much! Blueberry tasted great as well. just like fresh picked forest blueberries. 
,,,,,Brought yogurt to my home and had great delicious yogurt with my fav view.
,,,,,"Ellenos does not need another review, since it's well known and stunning but I had to give one anyways! I'm not much of a yogurt person, but I really love Ellenos!"
,,,,,"They have a lot of flavors to choose from and they are starting to let you sample them again! My absolute favorite is the Almond Mocha flavor! It is so flavorful and you get a slight crunch from the bits of chocolate. They let you mix flavors, so you could get half of one flavor and half of another, which is really nice if you're having trouble deciding!"
,,,,,This is the perfect snack to walk around and explore Pike Place with. Go to Ellenos!
,,,,,Obsessed. 
,,,,,"We tried this famous yogurt along our food tour and loved it so much that we knew we had to return the next day. We had their Marionberry Pie and another flavor which I cannot recall, but it had scrumptious chocolate notes. "
,,,,,"Their yogurt just hits different compared to the other yogurt cups you find at the grocery store. It's down right creamy, luscious, but yet still tastes like actual yogurt."
,,,,,I'm running to my closest Whole Foods supermarket in hopes that it'll tie me over until the next time I visit Seattle.
,,,,,I've never been to a greek yogurt scooping station before. Wow! They have so many flavors to choose from! They offer samples which is great for first timers like me. 
,,,,,"I settled for 2 flavors - blueberry and the key lime pie, but really, you can't go wrong with any of the flavors. We couldn't get enough and grabbed more at Amazon Go; 2 of their best sellers, mango and lemon curd. "
,,,,,"Had I known that Whole Foods has been carrying this product, I could've gotten this every time we went. "
,,,,,Great job Ellenos! Thanks for keeping our guts healthy.
,,,,,Local greek yogurt which you can also find in supermarket like amzon fresh！
,,,,,but the pike public store is just fantastic because you can find several surprising flavors like they recommend passion fruit or lemon curd. 
,,,,,Myslef like all pie flavored yogurt since ellenos add crunchy biscuits or pie adding in the yogurt，especially in the pumpkin pie yogurt you can have a taste of the pumpkin and the cinnamon. 
,,,,,healthier dissert choice！
,,,,,Ps the store does not receive cash
,,,,,"TLDR: still amazing 5-star yogurt, but 1-star COVID caution."
,,,,,"I've been here multiple times but this is the first time since the pandemic started (except once for Yelp event pickup). My friends are visiting and they craved Ellenos. We thought outdoor pickup should be safe, so we stopped by. "
,,,,,"While waiting in line, we noticed that one of the two staff at the counter was not wearing a mask. In addition, there was no glass shield between them and the wide-open yogurt buckets. Meanwhile, they were having a chatty conversation with the customer before us, essentially contaminating the half counter of yogurts in front of them. Out of sanitary concern I decided to leave, but my friend couldn't let go, so we stayed to only interact with the other masked staff, and ask for flavors on the safer half counter."
,,,,,"Not gonna return till the pandemic is officially over, no matter how delicious their yogurt is."
,,,,,"Thank you for loving Ellenos and also for taking the time to share this feedback with us. We take the health and well-being of our team and our community extremely seriously, and our policy requires all team members to wear masks at all times. We will be addressing this with the team, and thank you again for bringing this to our attention."
,,,,,I've always brought my friends from out of town here. They all loved it! 
,,,,,1. You can sample any flavors just like at an ice cream shop. 
,,,,,"2. For $5 you get a walk-around size, basically ton of yogurt in a cup that's easy for walking and eating"
,,,,,"They recently released a new flavor - ube. AMAZING!!! A must try, but only available on the weekend."
,,,,,The best yogurt we've ever tried. Hands down! A must try when visiting Pike Place. 
,,,,,We got the Marionberry Pie (It's the Marionberry with crumbs in it) and it was very delicious. Now I understand why it can make the ice cream jealous.So happy that we can get Ellenos Yogurt in San Francisco Whole foods now.
,,,,,"I sampled many flavors here including: passionfruit, marionberry, matcha blueberry, chocolate almond... but in the end opted for plain (sweetened with honey) and coconut cream pie. Out of everything I tried, the plain was the best one."
,,,,,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Ellenos since everything was a tad too sugary. My favorite Greek yogurt place is still, by far, Sophia's Greek Pantry in Massachusetts. Sorry, but I didn't think this place even came close!"
,,,,,Real fruit and cobbler swirled into tangy yogurt. 
,,,,,Highly recommend stopping by Ellenos when at Pike Place. 
,,,,,"So delicious, tangy, and sweet. Also very reasonably priced for a thick cup of dessert like yogurt. Also a ton of unique flavor options like chai, chocolate vanilla bean, olive oil and pink salt, almond mocha, musang lanka and pandan, ginger blueberry, and more."
,,,,,"Stopped by here cause it was so highly rated. It's a small storefront right at the entrance of Pike Place Market. There wasn't a line when I got there probably since it was getting later and chilly. I got the walk around size of the Marionberry flavor which was $5.25. I eat Greek yogurt every day for breakfast and I have to say flavor and texture wise this one is on another level. It's definitely Greek yogurt but it's so rich it's almost got an ice cream vibe. It comes in a parfait style cup and is easy to eat while walking around. Although its pricey, the quality is so high that it feels satisfying as a treat. I would take a tourist visiting the Market here for sure."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Wow!!!! Thought this was just some overhyped yogurt spot since yogurt is like so basic and every place has the same thing. But the flavor was so unique and so clean! It really had passion fruit in it and it was such a perfect dessert even for a cold day! Just get a small and share it! More than enough for two people. You can even sample the flavors if you ask!
,,,,,"I love Greek yogurt and was glad to have discovered this place while researching about Seattle eats. While a bit pricey compared to others, I think it's worth trying at least once. Eleno's has a lot of flavors to choose from and they were pretty generous with their samples. I had their famous marionberry pie and it was YUM even if it was too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed this place so much that I went back the next day and even the following day. I figured it was a local brand and I wouldn't get to taste their yogurt outside of Seattle / WA. Well, I was mistaken. They've done really well coz  this brand is sold in SoCal. I haven't purchased their yogurt since my trip to Seattle. Why? Coz the nutritional value isn't that great when compared to just plain Greek yogurt. But... I'd still give them 5 stars for the quality, taste, and flavor options. No complaints about service too."
,,,,,"Saw so many suggestions on Google of where to eat in Pike's Place Market, and this was one of them! Elleno's is just right outside of the actual market, having its own booth. I was surprised to hear that I was allowed to try out different types of yogurt before committing to one flavor! Tried the mulberry one, equally delicious but the apple crumble definitely tasted like a healthier version of an apple pie - with bits of apple crust crumbs that the server put at the bottom of my cup! Delicious and I think the small cup was a perfect snack. Thank you!"
,,,,,This place was soooooo delicious. Love all the flavors they have. I got the lemon cheesecake and some type of berry one..can't remember the name. The yogurts are sweet but not overbearing. Good to have for breakfast or as a dessert while you walk around.
,,,,,Went to go try out their 2021 flavor contest winners. So fun! Love it's cute lil spot at the entrance of pike place and sampling all of their different flavors. Personally my favorite was peppermint bark latte! Their yogurt is so creamy and delish!
,,,,,"All the times that I've been to Seattle and to Pike Place Market, Ellenos always seemed like the place to be with it's long lines outside their yogurt bar on Pike St."
,,,,,They specialize in Greek yogurt and first opened up in this location back in 2013 and have been steadily growing their following ever since then.
,,,,,Their yogurt starts with fresh local milk and takes five days to handcraft each batch using traditional family recipes and Greek straining methods.  This results in a yogurt which has a thicker consistency. 
,,,,,"I am not big on yogurt, but my boys are and I am always down to try something new.  Lucky for us, there wasn't much of a line when we visited on a hot late afternoon a few weeks ago!  When you get up to the counter, you'll see an array of different flavors to choose from like rhubarb, chai, mango, & more.  You can also ask for samples from the staff to help you pick a flavor.  "
,,,,,There are a few different sizes to choose from and you can get different flavors. My son chose the marionberry pie and I went with the lemon curd which was split in our walk-around cup.  My husband went with the olive oil.
,,,,,"Overall, I thought it was pretty good for yogurt!  I liked that the lemon curd flavor was prominent and the marionberry pie was tasty as well. Again, I'm not a big fan of yogurt, but it was worth a try.  My son enjoyed his marionberry pie and my husband loved his olive oil yogurt.  Tip, they only accept credit cards so be prepared."
,,,,,"Super yummy greek yogurt, I had to ask the lady that was working what was the most popular flavor and Im glad I did. Wish we had one of these in Las Vegas ‍"
,,,,,"If you like Greek yogurt, this is a place to try in Seattle! This shop is just by the public market and easy to spot. If you're indecisive about what flavor to get, you can ask them for a sample. "
,,,,,We ended up getting passion fruit and marionberry! I would recommend both if you like passion fruit.
,,,,,YUM!! It is our first time trying Ellenos as everyone says this is a must get at Pike Place. 
,,,,,"Something about Ellenos is so unique, there really is nothing like it. It's perfectly tart and sweet at the same time. We came around 1pm in the afternoon on a Saturday and there was a short wait. "
,,,,,Highly recommend the most popular flavors (with good reason) strawberry shortcake and marionberry!
,,,,,"Came here 5 years ago for a food tour, and was super excited to finally make it back to try more flavors! Definitely the top of my list for reasons to return to Seattle."
,,,,,"I love Ellenos because it's the perfect combination of sweet, tart, and creamy plus super unique flavors made with fresh ingredients. Tarter than chobani, creamier and fluffier than greek gods, smoother than noosa but a similar tartness."
,,,,,"For the smallest size, you get 2 flavors and it's a little over $5."
,,,,,"Chai- mild flavor, not bad, though I'd prefer stronger spices."
,,,,,Strawberry shortcake- tastes as expected.
,,,,,Om ali- our favorite. Tasted like baklava in yogurt. Loved the huge pistachios and cardamom flavor.
,,,,,Matcha blueberry- matcha flavor was on the subtle side. I liked that the blueberries were fresh!
,,,,,"Even during COVID, they are still giving samples. The lady working there was so generous that even after I had already tried a few sample and put down my order, she gave me another sample to make sure I'd like what I actually ordered."
,,,,,We came on a Monday late morning and there was no line. Wins all across the board.
,,,,,Gosh this place was so good. Tried the passion fruit and some kind of berry as part of a food tour.  Both were delicious- I need to come back to try the chai one day.

,,,,,"When your loved ones tell you that they want Greek yogurt while on vacation, don't give them a second thought and eye roll like I did.  Especially if it's Ellenos, because it's THAT good.  "
,,,,,"I thought my husband was out of his mind, but I'm sold.  He ordered the marionberry pie yogurt while I ordered the pumpkin pie.  His was nice and tangy with sons graham crumbles.  Mine had actual chunks of pumpkin pie and was superb.  "
,,,,,I even got home in San Diego and searched all over until I found it on sale at Vons.  I really enjoyed the lemon curd and passion fruit flavors.  I can't wait to try different flavors when I'm back up in Seattle.
,,,,,Mangooooooooooooo!
,,,,,"Who doesn't love Ellenos! Sinfully great tasting green yogurt without all that extra artificial sugar and junk. Just pure goodness. It's like eating ice cream but better and healthier. Even when I couldn't make it to Pike market location, I can get my hands on them. Mango and raspberry being my favorite but I'd happily eat the other flavors too. They are like dessert but much better, and better for you. You won't believe it's just Greek yogurt with fruit. "
,,,,,"The best flavors are definitely mango! Marion berry pie ( delicious), papaya passion fruit with an actual passion fruit! Lemon cheesecake. I mean all flavors are good. I even like their original. Sizes also varied:  walk around $4 to family and catering size. Not bad at all. I usually stick to walk around since I want to buy it and eat it right away as you should. "
,,,,,"My recent visit here was for their pike place collection launch. It has apple crisp, key lime pie and coconut cream pie: yumm! Apple crisp was the best. They've also moved back to their original spot which was just a 2 stalls over. Still right by the iconic pike place market sign. But much bigger space with more delicious yogurt. What's not to like. "
,,,,,"And now that they are everywhere, its even better. Love love love!! It's a Greek yogurt love."
,,,,,10000/5 I am obsessed and this is probably my favorite spot in Pike's Place. I am a diehard green yogurt fanatic and I eat it every day so it's no surprise that I fell in love with this yogurt during my visit to Seattle. 
,,,,,"Ellenos is essentially dessert greek yogurt and in my opinion it's even better than most ice cream I've had. Creamy, rich, and decadent. They have so many different flavors and samples are available so you can try them before ordering. You can also mix and match in whatever size you order! They have small cups that are perfect for a grab and go snack and even containers to bring home. "
,,,,,"The Hone MATCHA with blueberries flavor is ... out of this world. It's everything I've ever wanted. I love matcha with a passion and have never had a matcha greek yogurt and have literally wished for one for so long... so this was a dream come true. So creamy and not overly sweet, the perfect essence of matcha coming through and pairing beautifully with the juicy fresh burst of the added berries. The berries were fat and plump and so flavorful and the blend of fruitiness with the matcha yogurt was absolutely divine."
,,,,,"I also loved the Marionberry Pie flavor, which is their signature marionberry flavor with added pie crumbles. SO good. This one is a bit sweet but the added textural element of the pie crumbs really elevated this flavor. "
,,,,,"So good. I will think about this matcha yogurt for a long, long time."
,,,,,"Ellenos is a Seattle and Pike Place staple! Just look at the rest of the reviews to see how amazing Ellenos is! I've seen their yogurts in grocery stores, but I wanted to make sure my first taste was at Pike Place market for an even more special experience."
,,,,,Their Greek yogurt is a bit creamier and not as thick as other Greek yogurts I've had in the past. And I haven't been disappointed by any of their flavors. Whatever you're eyeing will be surely be delicious!
,,,,,"What I recently discovered about Ellenos, which made me love them even more, is that they collaborate with other local Seattle businesses to create an even more uniquely Seattle flavors. Recently, they collaborated with Musang (an amazing Filipino restaurant in Beacon Hill) to create a jackfruit and pandan flavored yogurt!"
,,,,,"While you're taking your quintessential Pike Place Market photos, I (and the thousands of other positive reviews) highly recommend taking a few steps off to the side to give Ellenos yogurt a try."
,,,,,"I always crave this yogurt place when I visit Seattle. They offer free samples if you don't know which flavor you want. This time I went with the brownie yogurt, which was really good if you are a chocolate lover. 10/10 would recommend this place if you are around pike place market."
,,,,,"Yogurta try this popular place out! We luckily came at a time when there was no line here. We got to sample some flavors before committing which was very nice. We got the passionfruit flavor and was probably the best Greek yogurt I've tried! The tart purée was blended throughout and complimented the yogurt so well! I'm not a huge fan of Greek yogurt, but this was definitely tasty  it lives up to its high 5-star rating on Yelp for sure!"
,,,,,My friends and I all really liked the Hone Matcha Blueberry flavor and highly recommend it! 10/10
,,,,,"I never expected to like Greek yogurt THIS much, but visited here while on vacation on a whim and ended up returning a second time. Even if you're not the biggest fan of Greek yogurt, I recommend trying it as a lighter treat compared to ice cream or frozen yogurt. "
,,,,,"We realized that some of the other flavors, such as passionfruit, can be purchased in select grocery stores as well."
,,,,,"Ok first of all, like probably many of you, I was thinking, ""how good can yogurt be for me to visit during vacation?"" Well... yeah it's that good. "
,,,,,"It's tart, creamy, sweet, and the portions are so generous. We initially had trouble finding Ellenos but it's on your right if you're facing the large Pike Place Market sign that everyone takes a photo in front of. "
,,,,,I was also very pleased that they were still doing samples. We got the Marionberry Pie and the Coconut Cream Pie and my only complaint is that it needs more crumble!
,,,,,Did you really go to Seattle without trying Ellenos? This place is right in front of the iconic pike place sign. This place is the best! We tried marion berry pie and it did not disappoint. We had the prepackaged yogurt the day before from the store but it does not compare to getting it in person here. Please make sure you try this place while walking down pike place. You won't regret it.
,,,,,"I tried the marionberry flavor as it seems like it's one of the most popular flavors here (plus I love marionberry). I mean, it's pretty good.....but 5-stars good? I dunno. I was expecting more of the iconic Greek yogurt tangy bite and somehow was expecting the tanginess of the yogurt and the marionberry flavor to mix into something magical lol. The tanginess of the Greek yogurt here is pretty seldom so overall it tasted more like regular yogurt w/ marionberry flavor."
,,,,,I still enjoyed it and this spot is worth checking out if you're exploring Pike Place in general. If you don't usually like Greek yogurt because of its tang give this place a try as you might actually end up liking the Greek yogurt here.

,,,,,"I checked at the entrance if it was dog friendly and they let me and my dog in. I have a very well behaved small dog. We ordered drinks. Right when the drinks were about to arrive, the server asked me if my dog was a service animal. And when I said no, he asked us to leave. He asked the next set of dog owners if their dog was a service animal. They lied and said he is. He never asked for any documentation. All I'm saying is before you let customers in with a dog, make up your mind whether or not you're dog friendly. After someone orders their fucking drink, please do not kick them out."
,,,,,One of my go-to spots when friends/family comes to Seattle to visit me. It's also the perfect place to go if it's raining outside. 
,,,,,"Going here really makes you appreciate the craft that goes into making coffee. Not sure what it is, maybe its the mesmerizing way they transport the coffee beans or the woodsy interior or how everyone on staff looks like coffee artisans. "
,,,,,"My go-to drink here is the Hazelnut Latte, it had the perfect amount of sweetness and the hazelnut comes through nicely without any bad aftertaste. I also highly recommend buying some of the pasties here - they're delicious and super fresh!!"
,,,,,"Came here not knowing what to expect and I was blown away.  This was a huge Starbucks with tons of options.  It was a very unique starbucks.  There were different beans to try, flights, barrel aged varieties, a bakery inside, a bar inside, and a whole roastery operation in the back."
,,,,,This place was packed with goodness!  I opted for a flight of different beans and would have never expected something like this from a starbucks.  I tried my friend's bourbon barrel aged coffee and it looked like a cocktail!  It was also very delicious and worth the premium.
,,,,,"Wow, this is quite the place to visit. If your in Seattle you must plan a stop here for great food, incredible coffee and cocktails. You can purchase reserved coffee and pick up supplies for your home coffee experience."
,,,,,Love this place! Exceeded every expectation I had for a Starbucks reserve. Tried probably one of everything from the food to the coffee and alcohol. The people are beyond kind and helpful. Extremely educational with the roasts and different drinks.
,,,,,"Interesting experience. Starbucks taken to the next level! Amazing assortment of pastries and unique coffees, as well as a bar... we had a flight of espresso martinis...at Starbucks. Staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. I would definitely come back here."
,,,,,Interesting place to visit if you're a coffee lover or not. They had great customer service. Awesome atmosphere and of course great coffee & desserts. It almost felt like a school field trip. My family and I enjoyed the experience. I would totally recommend stopping by if you're visiting the area. Its totally worth your time.
,,,,,This ain't your ordinary Starbucks down the street and I envy anyone that can say it is. 
,,,,,"Visiting from Hawaii we decided to try this place out for brunch.  From the outside you can immediately tell this is not your every day Starbucks.  The inside of this location is even more impressive.  Merchandise, food, coffee selections are all things you can't get at an ordinary Starbucks. "
,,,,,"The food is next level. Sandwiches, desserts, and pizzas were all very good. The merchandise is also very hip and cool. If you're visiting from out of state you'll be very tempted to leave with some kind of merch. "
,,,,,"Then the drinks...the whiskey barrel, aged cold brew was my drink of choice.  Very tasty and fancy, served in a whiskey glass with a large whiskey cube.  I regret not getting a second one. "
,,,,,The experience was great and I will be back the next time I'm in Seattle.  I wish they'd open one in Hawaii so I wouldn't have to travel so far.
,,,,,"I'll preface this by saying I've no idea what's going on there these days. I used to go to this Reserve once in a while pre-covid19 and it had closed down for a time at one point, so I don't know if it's still open in general. "
,,,,,"While this location is not as quiet as the store on 1st, the experience of browsing ample seasonal merch, seeing the impressive machinery, basking in the tasteful interior... I can see how it's become a must-go. It does seem more popular with tourists than locals, and understandably so, but it's lovely to visit and experience nonetheless."
,,,,,"I relate to the person in the reviews who said they were overwhelmed with the sheer amount of options on the menu. Even by the third time visiting it wasn't easy because there was just so much to choose from. The coffee is manageable, but the food? Oh, man. But I'll try to pick some to recommend so that you know what's tried and tested when you go."
,,,,,"I love the Olive sfilatino, but last time I was at this location I also tried the Prosciutto brioche and it did not disappoint in the slightest. And don't get me started on the Torta nocciolina. As for coffee: while usually happy to stick to my blonde lattes, I've tried other options at the Reserve, like the Sparkling Citrus espresso and the Classic affogato. Both were wondrous."
,,,,,"Anyway, don't get discouraged by the crowds. Spots go vacant fairly fast and the baristas are obviously amazing at their jobs so they take care of those long lines quickly enough. It is a bit pricier than other local coffeeshops, but well worth the occasional splurge!"
,,,,,Had to stop by the Reserve Roastery on our most recent trip to Seattle. Unfortunately I found it pretty underwhelming and overcrowded. 
,,,,,"Seating is at a premium and folks are pretty aggressive trying to place an order. I enjoyed the cold brew milkshake, but felt it was very pricey for what you received. "
,,,,,"If you're willing to spend a lot of time seat hunting and are a big coffee drinker, then this maybe worthwhile."

,,,,,Such an awesome experience getting a chance to visit this place. I stumbled across this place by accident as I was just looking for the closest Starbucks to my hotel. Didn't realized I would arrive at the Holy Grail of coffee. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable and they give many cool fun facts as you browse. Definitely worth the visit!
,,,,,Coming here is such a unique and fun experience! All the drinks are special to the roastery and the hand roasted beans make for an amazing pairing to the princi baked goods. The merchandise is so fun and there's new products in all the time! Would definitely recommend if you're visiting Seattle or if you're just looking for coffee and a dessert with friends.
,,,,,"Came here Vday morning. Fascinated by the setup of this Starbucks. This is located in Capitol Hill surrounded by bars and restaurants. Given the other locations in the country are in NY and Chicago, and we are from LA, we definitely needed to try everything LA Starbucks don't bring. We sat at the bar, ordered a whiskey barrel aged cold brew and wife got a cocktail, both were amazing. We also ordered pastries and avocado toast to eat. Wow what a treat! "
,,,,,"We actually came back the day after to try the ""experience bar"" where you can try their special reserve beans in different types of brews, including siphon."
,,,,,"Last little note, you're able to make purchases with your Starbucks card through the app, so if you end up purchasing items, you can rack up stars, only thing is you can't use your rewards at this location. Definitely worth a try!"
,,,,,"Great service, food, drinks - needs more seating but a great experience for any coffee fan. It's unique and interesting"
,,,,,"This was on my bucket list and I am so happy I finally got to try it!! We came around 8am on a weekday and there was 3 people in line. By the time we finished eating it was about 8:30 and the line was so long outside! We tried the cold brew malt, Hazel blanco latte, and an iced matcha latte for the drinks. For the pastries we tried the chocolate hazelnut croissant and salmon brioche (I think that's the bread). I don't even know how to describe the experience but everything we drank/ate was delicious!! The drinks were crafted perfectly and the pastries were so fresh you can literally hear the bread crisp when you bite into it (I'm not even exaggerating) . We ended up going another time and literally right before we headed to the airport! I even carried 1 chocolate hazelnut croissant all the way home to California bc I needed to take one with me. Their souvenir shop is super cute and they have a ton of different merchandise to purchase. Obviously the only downsside is that they are pretty pricey but the point of this Roastery is that they're high quality drinks/food and there's only 8 in the world so we didn't mind one bit! Definitely a must visit when in Seattle."
,,,,,This is my first time visiting a Starbucks Roastery and I absolutely loved the experience. I went here twice instead of waiting in line to go to the original Starbucks at Pike Place Market :) 
,,,,,"It was pretty busy both times we went, so you may find yourself waiting for a free table, or if your party is small enough, sharing a larger table with several other people. The line at the Mixology bar was by far the longest and took the longest to fulfill orders. The mixology drinks are definitely a splurge, worth trying if something really catches your eye, but the hubby and I both ended up enjoying our drinks from the Roastery menu more. We didn't get to try much of the food, but purchased a nice mug as a souvenir. You can also buy freshly roasted beans as well! Definitely a must-visit for me, especially since there isn't a Roastery in the SF Bay Area ;__;"
,,,,,Coming here made me the biggest starbucks fan ever! I was a bit overwhelmed when I first walked in with the crowd of ppl but totally worth.
,,,,,"When you first walk in threw the front doors, there usually an employee there giving out samples."
,,,,,Straight ahead:
,,,,,Pure coffee bliss with sandwiches and pastries! Everything was so good.
,,,,,Further down was a coffee sample bar I believe.
,,,,,To your left:
,,,,,The starbucks store with a bean bagging section to get your personalized weight of beans! They go as low as 1oz btw. Go ever further left and there are more baked good options such as flat breads! My fav was the mushrooms 
,,,,,Theres also the bar in this area... you cant go wrong with anything you order there. The old fashion was my fav tho
,,,,,"For my day off I decided to adventure and drop by this seattle tourist spot. Reserve locations are a big leg up from normal Starbucks. I will admit when I walked into this one, I was overwhelmed on where to start and where to go. They do have a little guide in the front explaining the store layout. The roastry part is pretty cool and plays a big part to the store's aesthetic. Given the day, I have to say it's decently crowded but not terribly so given the reputation."
,,,,,"I decided to get a pastry which name escapes me and the hazelnut bianco latte. Now my only con I found about ordering is if you forget the name of what you want, you need to either describe or try the pointing game since there is no way to read the display case when ordering. "
,,,,,I got the brioche filled with custard. It's light and fluffy with a good helping of custard inside. The brioche itself isn't that sweet but that's what makes it possible to not overpower the custard which is significantly sweeter but not too sweet at least for me as a sweets lover. 
,,,,,I'm not a good judge of coffee so I can't really describe my latte beyond it's not super sweet. It's not super bitter which I associate with black coffee but also not super hazelnut-y. Something I have noticed is that all the lattes have the latte art which is nice and really satisfying to watch. 
,,,,,"Also if you want, they have sparking water on tap at the main center bar where you pick up orders but you can also just ask them for some if you don't just want normal water. Something I found interesting and don't think I see at normal Starbucks."
,,,,,Very cool tourist spot! I really liked just walking around and embracing the great ambiance of this Roastery. The smells were great and the feeling was magnificent. 
,,,,,The baristas serve up a wide variety of different coffee concoctions. The flights of coffee and drinks are a nice way to try out the drinks at a reasonable price. My personal favorite would have to be the nitro infused cold brew. The flavors were just so smooth and refreshing. It is definitely a must try! 
,,,,,A visit at the Roastery is a fantastic way to start the day!
,,,,,"I am not sure if coming here during non-pandemic would be different. We came at about 9.30 am and a lady greeted us at the door. She explained the three different bars that each serves coffee, cocktails, and pastries. There are seating available, but first come first serve, and they do sanitize them between each guests."
,,,,,"I did my research the day before I went there, and my thoughts were the reserve would have a lot more menu items , especially the coffee. There were not very many drink items, I would say regular Starbucks would have the same if not more options. "
,,,,,"I ordered cold brew with sweet cream, since that is the only thing I drink these days from Starbucks. I asked the employee what would be the difference between this one and the one sold at the regular stores. He seemed a little taken aback, and finally said the beans are different. Well that is what I figured lol."
,,,,,"My brother got this Cold Brew Malt smoothie thing. It was $11. You get very small amount too, maybe a little less than a tall size. However, that was one of the best coffee smoothie drink I have ever had. Not sure if it is worth the $11 though.."
,,,,,All drinks are served in to go cups.
,,,,,"We had tiramisu from the pastry bar. It was good, but not mindblowing."
,,,,,"All in all, I think this is a good place to have a different Starbucks experience. I think this underwhelming impression was due to my probably high expectation. May be worth checking, especially if you are from out of the country. May go again when Covid ends."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Place is HUGE and drinks and pastries/food selection are way way way better than your average starbucks. Super crowded even on weekdays, but service is super efficient and there are tons of employees that can help if you have questions. "
,,,,,"You can order alcohol, pastries, caffeinated drinks and even pizza, all at different parts of the reserve. "
,,,,,"Tried the tiramisu at the bar on the right side (right side after entering the building), where they also serve pizzas and cannolis, etc. The tiramisu was SO light, fluffy and wasn't too warm. I loved it. The cream was delicious! Would definitely purchase again. $9. Order at the cashier and they plate it for you immediately. "
,,,,,"Ordered the pistachio latte at the main bar (largest serving area right when you enter), and it was SO amazing. I've never tasted anything like it, and they also added a couple citrus bits in it which gave it a tang. Super super smooth and yummy, not too sweet. $7.70. Ordered at the bar and they call your name at the end of the bar once your drink is ready. Pricier than your average starbucks but well worth the quality. "
,,,,,"Super crowded so it's hard to find seating, but we managed to snag one all the way in the back. There are tons of seating options, but there are also tons of people so you really have to look for tables. If you're ordering coffee flights, there's bar seating right in front of the bars. Have heard good things about the coffee flights but didn't really feel like getting 3 cups of 8 oz coffee right after lunch... maybe next time!"
,,,,,Also really cool you can see them bagging and packaging the beans and roasting them. Overall super cool experience and was well worth the price.
,,,,,Fun place. Crowded. 
,,,,,They have Princi pizza and bakery. Cold brew bar and hot. Impressing coffee attributes  but as always so expensive. Pack of coffee $18. Worth to visit one time to see the coffee roast.
,,,,,"I love pretentious dining as long as the food is good enough to have without the ""experience""."
,,,,,I'm a Seattleite. Liking coffee is a requirement of living here. But that doesnt mean we only buy drinks with overpriced marketing gimmicks.
,,,,,"Starbucks is fine coffee. Not great, but it's not Folgers... *shudder*."
,,,,,"Having said that, going to the ""fancy"" Starbucks and getting something special you cant get at a ""regular"" drink stand is something I like doing every once in a while and if that's what you are looking for, Starbucks Reserve is a cool place. (For coffee and/or alcohol. Their Boulevardier poured over coffee grounds is really good)"
,,,,,"BUT!... Everything other than the ""special"" coffees and their alcoholic drinks is... overpriced and over hyped. The food is...ok. Slightly better than cafeteria food. And all the products are branded kitsch."
,,,,,"So, if youre a coffee snob, and like the exclusive feel of your purchases, it's worth at least one visit. But dont spend on 'meh...' food..."
,,,,,I'm one of those people who LOVE Starbucks so I had to make the trek to this Reserve Roastery and it was absolutely worth it IMO.  
,,,,,"There are different sections for different experiences.  You can grab a map and a menu walking in and peruse before you order and sit.  I'm guessing this place gets extra busy but I happened to be here while everyone else was in self-quarantine so I got ""lucky"" (if you could call it that)."
,,,,,"Trying unique beans and watching them roast them is really fun.  If I could handle all of the caffeine, I would have tried more than one drink.  The food was good.  Nice selection and tasted nice."
,,,,,I can't wait to come back and try other items.  I wish they had more of these but I'm also glad they don't.  Great special thing to do in Seattle.
,,,,,"Please ask your customers if they want their food FOR HERE at the Princi bar!! The food and greeter's introduction of the Roastery are always worthy of 5 stars but today when I finally decided to partake in the GORGEOUS food and pastry at the Princi bar, the person taking my order totally rushed through the process :( "
,,,,,"Even during COVID, dine in customers get a nice plate, wooden tray, and true silverware to enjoy the food they purchase but the man taking care of me didn't ask me (or listen when I said ""for here"") if I was dining in and just threw my pastry and sandwich into two paper bags and shoved them my way as soon as I had paid, saying I was good to go. Maybe i'm just obsessed with instagramming pretty plates of food but I was sooo bummed that I wasn't getting the experience literally every other customer was having in the bar/Princi area with their cute wooden trays and glassware :((( I realize he must have been in a rush but what a bummer! I thought I was going to sit down to a cute meal but this part totally cheapened the experience... "
,,,,,Please ask your customers if they're dining in... it sucks to be the only person eating out of paper bags.
,,,,,This is the nicest unique Starbucks I've ever been to. I know there's the first Starbucks in Pike Place but this Starbucks Reserve is a more unique experience. There's roasting going on in the background and you can ask about freshly roasted beans only available at this store. The staff here are great and helpful. Must try the Whiskey Barrel Aged Cold Brew.
,,,,,"I do think all Starbucks Fanatics should experience it at least once, but knocked off a star due to it being so overpriced. Very good, but $12 for a shot of espresso, tiny scoop of ice cream and a mint leaf??? Eeek. You also cannot drink/enjoy the items inside due to COVID, so recommend grabbing your drinks on your way out. Great for tourists who want to take home souvenirs. Will return once it's fully open. It's really cool, everything is just closed off due to COVID."
,,,,,"This is not your average Starbucks. Put aside everything you know about your average Starbucks that pumps out coffee for the masses and take a step into this Starbucks Reserve Roastery. It is a beautiful, sensory overload from the moment you walk in. You wouldn't be coming here for a cup of coffee-to-go. I actually can't remember anyone walking out with a paper cup. You would be coming here for an experience. "
,,,,,"My favorite thing about this Starbucks was the offering of coffee beans roasted in small batches that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else. I had trouble choosing just one coffee and went for the flight of three different coffees: Guatemala Antigua, Ethiopia, and the Pantheon Blend. Delivery and presentation fo the coffee made the experience feel extra special. Each coffee was freshly brewed, served with a beautiful display that outlined everything you needed to know about each roast and small cups to enjoy each coffee separately. This experience allowed me to learn about and fully appreciate the flavor notes in each coffee. I also had a sip of the Whiskey Barrel-Aged Cold Brew and enjoyed it as well. "
,,,,,"I would highly recommend paying Starbucks Reserve Roastery a visit if you're in the Seattle area. There is a good mix of coffees, pastries, cocktails, merchandise at this Starbucks and it's only a short uphill walk from Pike's Place!"
,,,,,"this was on my list for when i was visiting seattle and i'm so glad i was able to stop by! i tried their espresso martini and wow, it was delicious! i'm not a huge alcohol person so i don't really like sipping on drinks but i didn't mind this one at all! they also have a bakery inside and they also have a more extensive menu.  we didn't have too much time so i basically was only there long though to finish my drink. i also wanted to watch them make the drink but i think due to COVID, they had me sit down and wait until my drink was ready.  no biggie, i'll just have to come back again next time (;"
,,,,,This place is OVERRATED and OVERPRICED.
,,,,,"Yes it is neat, but is it neat enough to visit - not really. If you really need to visit, just walk through and don't eat the prepared thawed out food. "
,,,,,"Parking: 1 Star - Good Luck with street parking or pay $5 an hour, to add to what you will spend in the Reserve"
,,,,,"Bathroom: UNISEX yes you read that right, it's a Unisex Restroom.  If you are not use  that kinda thing, it's strange.  I'll be posting a video on my Instagram page - Navy_family_adventures"
,,,,,"Food: 2 Stars, because the dessert was much better then the COLD HARD breakfast.  Like another review said, it taste like all the food as been previously frozen and thawed out.  If you don't mind that taste, then your fine.  We both had the Avocado Toast with Eggs.  The toast was so HARD I thought we were going to break a tooth and it was COLD.  This is not what I was expecting from this fancy place."
,,,,,"Customer Service: 4 Stars, friendly enough.  "
,,,,,"Coffee:4 Stars -  The cold nitrogen brewed coffee was different, but good.  "
,,,,,Just to tell you about the price of gifts - a small (maybe leather) keychain was $25. 
,,,,,"I've been traveling for 25 years and posting reviews on Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Facebook, Instagram and more since we've had those options. You can believe the review or try for yourself.  "

,,,,,"Do not go here if you plan to dine in. Complete disaster with no system of waiting for a table to sit down. People in here will cut you off so fast and would possibly fight you over a table. For the price, come here only for coffee to go then go to a real restaurant that you can relax at. Not worth buying the food at the expensive prices just to find a place outside to eat in the rain. "
,,,,,"Shame on Starbucks, great idea but poorly executed. "
,,,,,Tourist trap
,,,,,Crowded and touristy.  My daughter loved it .  Nice bakery options and decent espressos.  My wife did not love the macha
,,,,,"The space at Starbucks Reserve is huge, with two levels. The main level has coffee, sandwiches, pastries, the bar and desserts. Also, there is a small shop where you can get clothing, accessories and cups, etc. The downstairs level is an artsy library With a little bit of history about Starbucks. We learned that Starbucks first opened at Pike Place market in 1971, and today Starbucks goes annually around the world to find the perfect coffee bean which they speciality roast here so that each bag of coffee they serve here is unique."
,,,,,"This is a really cool Starbucks. They have a lot of food such as pizza, desserts, pastries that looked amazing but I didn't try. It was really busy on a Sunday early evening, so i had to wait and hover around to get a table. They had some really nice souvenirs that you don't find at other regular Starbucks. I was really excited to try the cocktails so I tried the Martini Flight which is a 3 cocktail sampler. They were so cute I couldn't resist. They were a huge waste of $22. They tasted so bad I could barely drink them. Other customers agreed. Go to Starbucks Reserve but DO NOT get the Martini Flight. My daughter got a non alcoholic cold brew ice cream float which was great."
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve is better than I thought it would be! I got the nitro mole mocha, which is already made with almond milk. The mocha is made with dark chocolate, so it's not overly sweet. The almond milk made it a little creamy but not too creamy to the point that it's difficult to finish. I couldn't really taste the mole but the combination of nitro cold brew and dark chocolate with milk is amazing. "
,,,,,"They have different experiences (they make it in front of you) and flights (coffee made different ways) you can order. They also have a mixology bar with cold brew cocktails. The space is always full and they have so many pastries (croissants, muffins, sandwiches) and they also sell Starbucks Reserve merch. Everyone was really friendly but if you come during peak hours you may find it difficult to find a seat."
,,,,,My favorite place to take first time visitors to Seattle! It's so nice and upscale here with unique drinks - try the malt! - and an espresso alcoholic bar. I love the espresso martini and the espresso flights as well. Make sure to try the Princi food as it's only available at Starbucks reserve
,,,,,"This is the second time I've been here. And I'm actually impressed. Of course everything there is overpriced. But seeing the people all work together to make the drinks and food was a good experience. Hopefully in the future I'll get to actually sit down and socialize with friends, especially in the bar area that would be interesting. The sandwich I had was very tasty but way overpriced. And then the nitro flight trio was again a good experience but again way over priced. I think they should have this in many more locations. Great hangout spot."
,,,,,"The Reserve Roastery allows you to experience some exclusive roasts that you cannot buy anywhere else. They also provide a variety of different brewing methods, whether its drip, pour-over, or syphon, you can experience experience how different brew methods change the flavor."
,,,,,"Outside of COVID times, the RR is usually packed, with people taking advantage of the different available roasts, gifts, and even watching the team cool the freshly roasted beans."
,,,,,"The last piece is probably the coolest part of this location, since you can watch them roasting the beans, dump onto the cooling table, and then watch them work their way through the conveyers to get to wherever they go to store/package them. Drinking here is an experience."
,,,,,"One of my favorite times here, the barista had just created a hot-brew of a coffee they usually serve as cold-brew. He poured me a sample of both to see how cold-brew vs. hot-brew changes the coffee."
,,,,,"My main reason for knocking down to 4 stars is that this location (much like the ""First Starbucks"") is very much a touristy place to go, and is always very busy/crowded and difficult to find seating. Their prices are also a bit on the high-side, even when compared with other Starbucks around."
,,,,,"I love Starbucks and visiting the reserve was a great experience! Its pretty big and has ample seating, however it does fill up. There is 4 separate areas to order. 2 for coffee, the bar, and the food area. We ordered a martini and their twist in the old fashion and they were both great! Both were rather sweet, so if you like sweet they are really tasty. A very fun space, it looked amazing. A must see!"
,,,,,"This Reserve Roastery is turning into a bit of a tourist spot, but still absolutely worth a visit--especially for true coffee lovers.  Unlike most Starbucks stores, they also have a lot of good food."
,,,,,"I had been here a few times, sometimes just to eat.  They feature Italian food, with really tasty pizzas and focaccia sandwiches with a lot of flavor.  They also have some great salads--definitely consider coming here for lunch or dinner.  They also have some excellent pastries."
,,,,,"However for most, the coffee is of more interest.  They have these coffee flights where you can try unusual coffees--they have a selection and you can try up to three.  It is definitely worth trying.  "
,,,,,They also have some great alcoholic drinks that are original.  This is really worth a visit.

,,,,,"My experience could've been really awesome, but it wasn't mainly because of one rude barista. He clearly had his favorite customers and he didn't even try to hide it. No explanation or interesting pieces of info about the drink I ordered, no conversation, nothing. In fact, he kept talking to the other customers while he was making my drink. When I asked a question about the drink he was visibly annoyed that I was even talking to him. I paid $12 for a drink to have some barista roll his eyes at me. Great deal, Starbucks! Ironically he was working at the Experience Bar... "
,,,,,"The girl behind the alcohol bar was really helpful and friendly, and the facility itself was pretty cool. I'm just bummed that what could've been a 5-star experience was just really disappointing."
,,,,,"Starbucks can't even give me the right pizza for their expensive price. Too many people inside trying to cut you off for a table. Bad idea. Go spend your money at a real restaurant that you can eat at for cheaper unless you like to spend a lot to eat your food standing or outside in the rain. Starbucks need to fix the system, can not enjoy this place as is."
,,,,,"If you are in Seattle, you must visit Starbucks Reserve Roastery; it's Only 6 worldwide so far. It doesn't feel like you're in a Starbucks; usually, I'm not a big fan of Starbucks, but all the items in this place are different from a regular SB. It was just a great experience! Cocktails, specialty coffees, great pastries, and foods. It is worth a visit and a lot of fun if you have never been."
,,,,,A must-visit if you're a tourist!
,,,,,"First-rate customer service. I'm glad you need to show vaccination proof in order to be served. But just in case you don't have your phone or card with you, they'll still create a delicious coffee you can enjoy outdoors."
,,,,,"I'm happy to support a company that treats its workers well, and that originated in Seattle. One reviewer mentioned some steep steps to access it....there IS  a wheelchair accessible entrance! "
,,,,," I'm very glad that the many people visiting or moving here from California feel it measures up to their so-high standards, though they're not ""Starbucks fans."" We've known all along how great this company is."
,,,,,"Very cool concept.  Just outside the downtown area but worth the trip there.  A variety of drinks we don't have in our local Arizona stores, onsite roasters and homemade pastries.  Lots of souvenirs too."
,,,,,"I just stopped by to get latte when I was on the way to my hotel, but I was surprised! It was so huge place!! I love Starbucks so I was impressed!! "
,,,,,This place is also considered a restaurant. They have tons of food and baked items! Food is pretty decent too. Also they have pizza!
,,,,,The inside of this place is fantastic. Three separate areas that you can order coffee/tea.. they have a coffee tasting.this place a great hangout for friends and co-workers and couples!
,,,,,Creme de la Creme of Starbucks
,,,,,SITREP
,,,,,What a treat this last time I was in Seattle to experience a fun stop at Starbucks' *FLAGSHIP* operation on Capitol Hill:  The Starbucks Reserve Roastery of Seattle.
,,,,,FULL DISCLOSURE
,,,,,"I can be a coffee snob and prefer the roasts of our independent coffee houses here in Sacramento, such as the Insights, the Temples, the Old Souls, and even some one-offs like Morning Brew and Luchardos."
,,,,,"But when I'm traveling around the country - especially drivng the interstates - I take comfort pulling of the exits and hitting a franchise I know, Starbucks - or Peets for that matter - so I can grab my java and hit the road again withou hardly skipping a beat."
,,,,,"And there's a lot to be said about the customer loyalty program, where based on my prior purchases, all it takes is 50 points off my registered rewards account to get my Venti Blonde to enjoy."
,,,,,"But what I saw here was amazing, and full head & shoulders above both most the indies and other Starbucks I've seen.  This was special....."
,,,,,THE SETUP
,,,,,"From coffee, to pastries, to nitro brews, etc., THIS is the spot that tests, experiments, randomly surveys all of their new, and improved (and possibly discontinue) products."
,,,,,"And I am not kidding:  the products here are FULLY a notch - or two - above items you anywhere else - and in comparing stores to this Reserve Roastery, this spot is far better than:"
,,,,,"* your esteemable Starbucks you catch in it's stand-alone brick & mortar adjacent to a University, "
,,,,,"* especially above the Starbucks in the plaza or mall; and, "
,,,,,* most certainly worlds apart from the Starbucks at the Freeway Exits.
,,,,,There just ain't no comparison to this Starbucks.  [I am even debating that every rating of 5-Stars I've given to the best Starbucks I've been to before I should downgrade to 4-Stars.]
,,,,,MENU OF ITEMS
,,,,,All over the place!
,,,,,"* Pizzas that really aren't pizzas, but rather flatbreads with yummy stuff on top!"
,,,,,"* Sandwiches that really aren't sandwiches, rather breads holding all sorts of yummy stuff inside"
,,,,,PROOF IS IN THE TASTE - FRIEND IN THE TRENCHES
,,,,,"Even coming from Sacramento, it was such a treat to have a friend here in my lovely muse Tanzie - who I first met at the Starbucks Reserve Bar in Sacramento."
,,,,,"So I got to ask Tanzie, ""Give me the scoop!  What coffee beverage right now here is all the buzz around?""  Without missing a beat, Tanzie told me, ""You gotta try the Pistacchio Latte!"""
,,,,,PISTACCHIO LATTE
,,,,,"So I tried the Pistacchio Latte and it blew my socks off, it was so good.  "
,,,,,"I wasn't even sure I would like the taste Pistacchio redacted to a coffee flavor, but I was wrong and it was so good. "
,,,,,THE LOWDOWN
,,,,,This Reserve Roastery is the Gold Standard of Starbucks.
,,,,,This is a must visit! Great place to test out different coffee flavors! They offer great new drink ideas!
,,,,,"If you are a fan of Starbucks, it's worth the visit. The line is always long but if you're lucky you can hop on when it's during an off time. I managed to get in when the line was pretty short and checked out each of the sections. There's an area for drinks and food, a coffee bar, and gift shop. I enjoyed seeing the location.  The drink was overpriced but I assume the experience is what you're going for. I got a nitro brew and it was good but definitely wouldn't buy on a regular basis."
,,,,,"What better place to experience my first Starbucks Roastery than to visit the one in Seattle, the birthplace of this iconic franchise?"
,,,,,"Although I am not a coffee drinker (shame... I know), I still found my visit to the Roastery quite enjoyable. It was more than I had imagined when it came to a Starbucks on crack. The entire shop felt very much like a walk through a Starbucks museum with baked goods, light bites, and cocktails influenced by the brand. Plus, there was an array of merchandise specific to this location that you can buy and take home for yourself to show off to coffee lovers, but I digress."
,,,,,"I went straight to the bar with my friend since I was in the mood to try a craft cocktail with the Starbucks branding at its side. My eyes quickly drew to the Agave Old Fashion ($13), combining a sweet tea experience blended with the makings of an oldie. It was my first time drinking a beverage of steeped tea in alcohol and I quite liked the end result. The concoction was light and strong and didn't contain any coffee at all."
,,,,,"Overall, a great experience for a local and tourist to check out especially if you have any affinity towards the major brand."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Such a cool and fun spot to hit for coffee, and Starbucks, lovers! They have coffee, food, and cocktails. There's a good selection of merchandise as well for souvenirs. The Original Flight Sample was a good way to try different coffees. There's enough coffee in the flight to share with someone else. -1 star for the limited seating. Had to really scout for a table."
,,,,,"My husband and I went twice so we were able to try a few different things. The first time we went, I ordered the espresso martini, which is the best drink I've had in a long long time. The bartender was great and was able to give me other recommendations as well. My husband got an espresso flight and liked one of three espressos. Overall he was not impressed. We went back again and I got the martini flights. The bartender this time was filling in for someone else, so it took about 25 minutes to get my drinks and the ratio of alcohol to mixer seemed to be a bit off. Looked really pretty though! Would go again just for the espresso martini"
,,,,,"I love this place! A must see if you visit Seattle. Its a bit of a walk from Pike market. Get your walking shoes on. Get here early or later in the evening. Great eats and vibe. The staff are super helpful, and informative. Lots to see and buy. Difficult to find seating area if busy. Be prepared to wait, but worth it."
,,,,,"I wanted a nice hazelnut latte with hazelnut croissant in a reasonable presentation, given that my visit was a special trip. They ask you ""Do you have a table?"" Instead of ""For here/To go"" which is a weird question considering there's no way someone alone can find a table until after receiving their coffee. So I get my drink in a paper cup and crushed croissant in a paper bag, and I ask the lady why I'm getting it to go when I wanted it for here. She explained the weird question so I asked if I can just have the stuff replated or even give me the tray and cup so I can do it myself and she refused. Asinine customer service, really ruins the experience. The coffee was pretty good though, and I'd recommend the croissant. Just make sure to lie about your seat. It soured my experience and I wouldn't come back here again."
,,,,,"Want a super cool, sort of elevated Starbucks experience that you don't have to drive into the belly of Seattle for (or fight for overpriced parking) that feel super secret? The SoDo Roastery is for you! "
,,,,,"It is such a cool little modern slice of chill! There are three parts to this place: the front where you can purchase limited edition Starbucks swag, clothing, and beans (hello whiskey barrel aged coffee!), a coffee/booze (YESBOOZE) bar to the right, and a SCRUMPTIOUS food counter straight ahead to the back. "
,,,,,"I might be jinxing myself by saying this, but I've been there at different time of the day, and it hasn't ever been overpacked. The staff is so friendly and know their stuff! "
,,,,,"I haven't had something and not loved it here. Although, some surefire hits are their Fungi pizza and their GIANT cream puffs. My favorite recent drink is a bit of an indulgence -- the bicerin (pronounced as bee-cheh-REEN); with heart-warming layers of drinking chocolate, espresso and delicious cream that takes its name from the vessel it is served in, which means ""small round glass."" It is a MUST try!"
,,,,,"Really cool Starbucks place. They offer Winn, beer and alcohol as well. Really enjoy this place. Check this place out when you are in town."
,,,,,I came here with my husband the other day for the first time - and we're local to Seattle! Can't believe I hadn't visited before. 
,,,,,"As a HUGE coffee connoisseur (at least in my mind), I love exploring different local coffee shops, and Starbucks usually isn't at the top of my list (unless there's no local options available). But I had heard the Reserve Roastery was a place to visit and so we came on a Sunday and brought our laptops so we could both do some work. Of course, the moment we arrived, I realized that we might not even find any seats because it was so busy! But luckily we were able to snag the perfect spot in the corner by the mixology bar, that had comfortable seats AND outlets."
,,,,,"There's different areas that you can order coffee/pastries, and then there's a bar where you can order drinks and an area with more food options. I love the many choices available! I was a little overwhelmed because I wanted to try everything! But I settled for the Brioce muffin stuffed with Nutella (SO GOOD) and a Dark Chocolate Mocha. My hubby got the Hazelnut Bianco Latte (he loved it) and a hazelnut croissant. Everything was absolutely delicious! I wish the regular Starbucks would also offer the Dark Chocolate Mocha - it was one of the best mochas I have had! "
,,,,,"I highly recommend coming here if you haven't yet! Yes, the lines are long and it's a bit pricey - I think we paid around $23 for the 4 items we got - but it's definitely worth coming at least once :) "
,,,,,I can't wait to come back!
,,,,,"Love it. We had a wonderful time here. Servers are very nice although they are super busy. Great location, wonderful and fun environment to learn the coffee culture."
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve Roastery was a place that I had bookmarked for a long time. I've heard from many people to make sure to stop by if I'm ever in Seattle. Luckily, we didn't have much planned that morning and we ended up spending a couple hours here in the store and drinking coffee and eating good food."
,,,,,When you first walked in it was amazing how big the tire place was. On the right-hand side was the bakery. In the far back was a bar. The left-hand side was your standard coffee bar area. And right in the front is where all the merchandise is.  It's all overwhelming but some of the workers were able to explain the concept is and gave us a better idea of where to start.  There's tables throughout the entire place but usually there's tons of people everywhere so if you find something out then be sure to take it. Be prepared to share your table specially if you're at one of those large communal tables.
,,,,,"The bakery section had some fantastic food. I ended up ordering a lasagna and a prosciutto sandwich.  In that section it's a deli style where you walk to the counter and one of the workers will come to you. There isn't a formal line so it was confusing at the beginning since everybody was too courteous and didn't want to cut in front of anybody.  We're so accustomed to waiting in line that it was awkward to make sure you weren't ""cutting"" ahead."
,,,,,The coffee section was very cool they have their own seasonal brew at the time. The menu provides a description on what kind of flavors and notes each coffee type had.
,,,,,In the far back left section there it's an area where the workers are roasting and grinding coffee beans.  Every once in a while you'll see something cool happen.
,,,,,Parking: it seems like there isn't much parking available just have to get lucky to find some street parking in that area.
,,,,,What a great place. Awesome ambience. Enjoyed their pastry - Tiramisu was my fav in that. 
,,,,,"They got a long wait and this place gets pretty crowded, stay safe during this COVID-19 times"
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,If you love coffee (and Starbucks) then this is a must-visit when you're in the Seattle area. 
,,,,,"Place itself is huge with different counters and areas where you can order food, coffee and pastries. There's also an area by the entrance where you can buy a wide variety of Statbucks merch -- from the typical mugs and drinkware to bags, shirts, notebooks, etc. "
,,,,,"It can be very busy with lots of tourists and though they have a lot of seating options, it can be quite full and tricky to find a table. "
,,,,,This is a working roastery that supplies to the different Starbucks locations in Washington and it is definitely interesting to see a glimpse of their process. The staff at the roasting area are very knowledgeable and are willing to share more info and explain their process. 
,,,,,"I ordered their Nitro Mole Mocha while the hubby ordered their Whiskey barrel-aged cold brew coffee and a pastry with custard inside. My drink was great! Loved the flavors and the smoothness of the drink. HIGHLIGHT: definitely the Whiskey Barrel-Aged cold brew! You get a small carafe and a whiskey glass with a block of ice -- and you pour it like you're pouring whiskey. The smell is amazing and it smells like whiskey - oak-ey, vanilla, fermented notes. The taste is mind-blowing too -- it smells and tastes like whiskey without the alcoholic burn and with coffee notes in it. We definitely enjoyed this drink a lot. It is pricey though so be prepared! The whiskey aged cold brew was USD 10 while the mole cold brew was USD 8. "
,,,,,The pastry was a bit dry though it it stuck to the muffin liner. So it was a bit of a bummer.
,,,,,Definitely drop by and try out their whiskey aged coffee because it's just so unique. Will surely go back to this place when we're in Seattle
,,,,,"I've waited a long time to finally step foot inside this store. It did not disappoint! From the signage to the sights to the aromas to the baristas to the bakery to the sale section. Definitely a Starbucks-aholic place to be when in Seattle! The coolness factor here is larger than a trenta tea and better than a quad shot! So glad I trekked here while I was in town, you should too!"
,,,,,"This is an experience I recommend if you have some extra time to kill and you're in the area. I would not necessarily go out of my way or dedicate a ton of time to it. It's unlike any other Starbucks, food and drinks are much better quality. However, that makes it almost just feel like a completely different restaurant. Waited 30 minutes to get in and another 20 to order. Pastry items and drinks were awesome, and all of the machinery makes it look really cool."
,,,,,"This place is like a starbucks mini museum, it is 10x better than the first starbucks down the street. It has a cooler exclusive menu to just the starbs reserves. The lines seem to always be long as it is popular among tourists, students, and locals. Be prepared to wait 10-20mins for your drink to be made. Do yourself a favor and get the pistachio latte. I am not a coffee person, and I am the type of person who can't tell the difference between coffees but this pistachio latte, WAS DIVINEEE! I felt like the critic from ratatouille when he was tasting colors and transported to his childhood! I kid you not. I don't particularly care for pistachios in general but this drink was creamy, nutty, sweet, flavorful as hell! Mind you it is quite sweet do if you drink coffee black it may not be your forte but this is the best cup of coffee i've ever had. We also got the cold brew nitro mole mocha. I like cold brew but I usually add stuff to it. This drank came like a dark ipa beer. Foam on top of just cold black coffee. I tried it and it was pretty good for a coldbrew black with nothing added but  it wasn't what I expected when I ordered it. I will be going back and trying all their hot lattes from now on!"
,,,,,So so so good! I love going to starbucks reserve. They have things on the menu that you can't get at a regular starbucks and the vibe is so nice! I love sitting here and just watching the coffee be roasted. It's sometimes hard to find a table but you just gotta be patient. I tried the hazelnut bianca latte and it was so good! I want to go back and try more drinks. There is quite a line usually but it also moves fast because they let in a bunch of people at a time.
,,,,,"When in Seattle, you gotta visit a Starbucks! And what better location than the Reserve Roastery? We came in on a Sunday at around 11 am, and it was crowded - as expected. Luckily, the line to order coffee/food moves pretty quickly. It's just finding a seat that's difficult."
,,,,,"I ordered the whiskey cold brew, which was amazing. It was either brewed with Knob Creek Whiskey, or there was something to do with the barrels. The flavor was very subtle, so the whiskey is not overpowering. It almost had a chocolatey taste to it. My fiancé had some kind of nitro cold brew float, which was good too - but not as good as mine. I wanted to buy some of the Knob Creek coffee beans but at $48 for half a pound, it was pretty pricey. Kind of regretting not buying it though. I did buy some more reasonably priced coffee beans but haven't gotten the chance to try them yet. I like that you can also buy in 1/8 pound increments so you can try it at home before you commit to a whole half. "
,,,,,"Although crowded, definitely still worth a visit."
,,,,,"Great service and great drinks. The only downside is that there are no vegan bakery options. Overall, would go back again for the drinks and the atmosphere. Staff were all very helpful as well."
,,,,,"This was my second visit and it was just as outstanding as the first visit. We ordered an espresso martini flight, tried the golden monkey tea, seasonal espresso drink and a couple sandwiches. All were sooooo good. I cannot wait to visit Seattle again and come back and try something new."
,,,,,Starbucks gentrifies communities and exploits prison labor for ~0.20 an hour; wage slavery. 
,,,,,"Stop feeding the rich, sip local bean juice"
,,,,,"If you can't get into the original Starbucks location because the line is way too long, then this location makes up for it.  They do serve food, pastries, etc.  But they also have a coffee infused alcohol bar!  The drinks were really tasty and much more than your typical Starbucks location."

,,,,,I live near Modesto California and we went to Seattle Washington our plans were to visit the reserve store and we were excited about it. Everything was fine until one employee asked if we had a table because my wife was eating a cheesecake and we told him no. For a moment I taught that he will be providing a table but for our surprise he told us to leave. We were in shock. We complained to the manager. Sadly I don't remember her name but she didn't apologize or offered to help us in any way. Really disappointed that we made such a long drive to be treated like this. There were a lot of people just standing around like us but we were the only ones to be kicked out of the store. Nobody helped us. Feel horrible to be discriminate. Be aware. Think twice before going over they are really racist. This incident happened on December 28 after 5pm

,,,,,Wow fancy Starbucks but make a reservation before you come. Be sure to also cost the locale market and oyster bar. Ten steps away and very exciting food.
,,,,,I honestly think people come here for the gram only. When you come here you need to have a table prior to ordering or u can ask for a to go bag and wait for people to leave. There's honestly not enough tables for the amount of people that visit. 
,,,,,"One of the workers gave my food to someone else they don't even ask to see ur receipt they just call out names and anyone can get it. So hectic, a lot going on! "
,,,,,They need to do better for a Starbucks.
,,,,,"As someone who is a tea person, I'd give this place an 8/10 mainly for their aesthetics. The interior is super cool, and I think this place is worth going for the experience. But beware, they do not serve your typical Starbucks drinks! I wanted one of their refreshers, but ended up ordering some lavender sage tea.. which really didn't cut it for me. Maybe I should've added a sweetener. My dad ordered their whiskey barrel aged coffee (and some other one that I forgot) and he said it has this special fragrant that beats vietnamese coffee. He ended up buying a bit of coffee beans for himself and a couple of family members. The roastery is perfect for coffee lovers, but it's still a cool place to check out if you don't like coffee. Just a little ways (10 minute walk) from Pike Place Market."
,,,,,Super interesting and definitely not your average Starbucks. Great food and drink selection and would love to return in the evening for drinks
,,,,,"I'm not the biggest Starbucks fan but I knew I had to stop by to check our their roastery.   Walking in, it is indeed like being in Willy Wonka's factory!"
,,,,,"The space is huge and is separated into an Italian restaurant, a gift shop, the roastery and a coffee shop.  Upon entry, a huge menu is available for viewing.  While they offer the standard drinks (coffee, tea, etc.) you can find in any Starbucks, they also had special reserve coffees, cocktails and drinks.  They also have sandwiches, ice cream dishes and pastries.  "
,,,,,"I ordered a tall dark chocolate mocha for $7.  Yes, it was and is pricey, especially since it only contains espresso, dark chocolate and milk.  However, it was delicious and well balanced.  It wasn't to sweet, bitter or burnt-tasting.  This might be the best Starbucks beverage I've ever had!"
,,,,,"Seating during these times was quite sparse, likely due to the need to socially distance the tables.  However, I was able to find a seat the faced the room, with a full view of the roastery and its operations.  People watching at its best!"
,,,,,This space is touristy but it's also quite relaxing and pleasant inside.  Service was quite friendly and the staff was helpful with explaining the menu and coffee products sold there.  
,,,,,During non-Covid times I'm sure this place is super crowded and busy but on the day of my visit it was certainly busier than most places in the area but still relaxing.  The gift shop had some items that were unique to the Reserve locations.
,,,,,"It's worth taking the time to check out, especially if you enjoy coffee.  This is not like the regular Starbucks coffee shops."
,,,,,Awesome place to visit to see all the cool different types of brewing and coffee Starbucks has. Along with some boozy beverages. 
,,,,,Super expensive - but worth seeing! I thought this was a lot more fun than seeing the first Starbucks in Pikes Place market. 
,,,,,"We stopped in while waiting for dinner reservations, so I feel like we didn't get to fully experience the drinks & food. "
,,,,,They have employees standing around to answer questions about the roastery - very knowledgeable people!
,,,,,"Really cool experience, we were able to see the big coffee roasters in action. The prices are pretty high but it's worth checking out at least once. The food and drinks were all very good and there's a lot of new options that aren't available at typical Starbucks stores."
,,,,,"The roastery in Seattle is awesome. It's definitely a smaller space with limited seating, so be prepared to take your order to-go if you're visiting during peak time (I believe there's a park nearby that you could go to hangout). "
,,,,,"In terms of service, all of the team members work essentially in unison to keep a tight ship. With COVID, there was always a team member waiting to wipe down tables for the next set of guests to sit down."
,,,,,"The food and drink selection is incredible, so you can't go wrong with any choice you make."
,,,,,"What an experience this was! So cool to see the roastery and enjoy a delicious hazelnut latte. Definitely go and try their flights they are delicious and the food is so good. Overall a cool place, great staff and amazing coffee."

,,,,,Found a ton of beautiful and cool souvenirs; each unique on their own. We left with several mugs and stickers. Employees working the giant coffee thingy were friendly and posed for pictures with a thumbs up.
,,,,,"Baristas as both the coffee and bar bar were very informative and suggestive about which beverages would fit our palette. We ordered the whiskey cold brew and Nitro mole mocha from the coffee bar and the Boulevardier at the bar bar, and presentation was very classy. The whiskey brew was amazing! Perfect blend of whiskey and coffee and the smell will blow you away."
,,,,,If you are a coffee fan this place is a must for visiting. You have the option to see different ways of brewing coffee as well as overall knowledge on coffee. The food is also exquisite and fresh. We tried a flight of different alcoholic coffees which was amazing.
,,,,,"We had no choice but to go on a Sunday-I had planned to go really early, but that wasn't the case. There was a line down the block, but I think we waited only half an hour or so to get in. "
,,,,,The employee at the door was really engaging and watched like a hawk to ensure no one came in without waiting. He told me that almost nothing at  the roastry is available at the normal locations.
,,,,,"The pastry and food area is full of amazing looking things, we bought a couple to try."
,,,,,"Right now they have a whiskey barrel cold brew-my husband had a malt made with it, my son a regular cold brew, and now they're hooked. Only $40 a bag!!"
,,,,,"The Roastery is a pretty incredible experience for coffee lovers, even if you're anti-Starbucks. This location is immaculate, the air is heavy with the smell of roasted coffee beans, and the counters are dressed with the prettiest pastries and pizzas. It doesn't matter how many Starbucks you've been to, I promise you, you've never seen anything like this. The baristas and service members have an overwhelming amount of coffee knowledge that they're just dying to share, and I encourage you to listen. It's fascinating. As a local, I'll have to admit that this place is an absolute tourist trap which can sometimes ruin the experience, but if you can see past the crowds, add this to your list of stops, as it's an obvious Seattle must."
,,,,,"I usually go to Starbucks for convenience and consistency - not necessarily for spectacular coffee. However, I had heard the Reserve Roastery was an experience and next level, so I couldn't miss stopping by! "
,,,,,"First off, the location is BEAUTIFUL! The whole experience the moment you step in the door is that of luxury. The roasting equipment takes the spotlight in the center of the roastery, with a wrap-around bar, tables along the edges, and a retail section where you can buy all things Starbucks coffee + reserve blends. "
,,,,,They brew only the reserve beans here. They have many brew methods for you to choose from. They also have a selection of pastries. 
,,,,,"They are often busy, so be prepared for that!"
,,,,,Wish I had went when it wasnt on a near lockdown but glad I made it here! Always been a Starbucks fan and seen a Starbucks that served pizza. I didnt even know they served alcohol!! Nothing too crazy but cool.
,,,,,OMG    so fun and a totally different experience from any other regular Starbucks.  The trio of espresso martinis is a must. If you don't like to wait long avoid on Saturdays if possible.
,,,,,"Coming here is like going to a coffee museum. Right when you walk in, there are cool unique items that can be purchased that you don't normally find at other Starbucks locations, including puzzles, throw blankets, and of course different types of mugs and cold presses. Behind the gift item area is where you can order alcoholic beverages and Princi food items. There is an area to the left of the main entrance where you can order coffee/pastries that you normally would at any other Starbucks. However, their menu is much more extensive and includes the Seattle-only whiskey barrel-aged cold brew. You must try this cold brew because it is absolutely the best coffee you'll ever taste. I'm not much of a whiskey fan, and I loved it this special cold brew. Although it has whiskey in the name, there is no alcohol in the actual cold brew. We also got the Irish con crema to try. Both drinks were delightful, but the whiskey barrel-aged cold brew was the clear winner. We're definitely going back tomorrow for more! Also, fun fact: the location of this reserve was previously a Ford/Chevrolet lot, and the lighter-colored speckled tile on the floor inside is still original from way back then before Starbucks acquired the building."
,,,,,"A must visit touristy spot in Seattle. They have a bakery, a mixology bar, gift shop area, and a coffee shop that is apparently completely different from normal Starbucks. My friend and I tried a flight of coffee for tasting. We were given three different types of coffee, and tbh I really couldn't taste the difference that much. I'm just not a coffee snob... Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this establishment. It has great ambiance, interior décor, and that snobby feel to it (which I love)."
,,,,,Awesome spot to take a break and enjoy some amazing specialty coffee drinks. It's a little busy mid but we'll worth it!
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Has such a nice vibe. Definitely has a lot of tourists but the people doing work in the area makes it feel like a local haunt as well. Good selection of food but it's definitely not their strength, and understandably so."
,,,,,such a bad experience with this location. They charge me for extra stuff  i didn't notice in that moment later on i sow on my receipt. I called to the store manager but they couldn't do anything they told me call Starbucks customer service. 
,,,,,non-professional. 
,,,,,if you go to this location make sure you check your receipt most probably they're gonna add some stuff. 
,,,,,probably then make money with this why.
,,,,,"Really cute place! I've never been to a Starbucks reserve but I really enjoyed it. The only thing is that it's pretty busy and you can't order any cocktails without getting a table, and obviously when it's busy it's pretty hard to get a table. Pretty limited seating as well. But definitely a great stop. We got the espresso martini flight and the Coldbrew and whiskey flight as well. Shared tiramisu, but definitely will get food next time!"
,,,,,"This is a really incredible building with great food and drinks. Something you have to see for yourself to believe. While I myself on a super food coffee company, I have to give credit to Starbucks for putting gourmet coffee on the map."
,,,,,Must visit! The drinks themselves were average nothing worth coming again for. The smoked salmon sandwich was great! The place is cool to visit and definitely worth going!
,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle for a few days and decided to check out the Starbucks Reserve Roastery. Right when we stepped in, we were greeted with the amazing smell of freshly brewed coffee! This Starbucks was huge and honestly so beautiful. There were a bunch of pastries and made to order goods to choose from. There was even a bar! Honestly, we were a little overwhelmed with how different it was from a typical Starbucks upon entering, but a worker was standing by the door ready to provide us with  information. "
,,,,,Things we ordered:
,,,,,- Smoked Salmon and Cream Cheese on Brioche : This was AMAZING. Seems simple but it was honestly so good! I ate one and wanted to buy another! 
,,,,,- Caprese on Foccasia Sandwich: The bread. I can't emphasis this enough. The bread was great. 
,,,,,-  Whiskey Barrel Aged Cold Brew: My boyfriend got this and he was so in love with the flavor and aroma that he bought 3 bags of the coffee beans
,,,,,- Irish Con Crema: 5/5. This was simply amazing.
,,,,,"Such a cool experience. If you're in Seattle this place is a MUST! The line is intimidating but goes by fast! Also be ready to spend some $ with awesome cups, clothes and other items that are exclusive to this location"
,,,,,"OK, this might be my favorite coffee shop in Seattle. My go-to destination Sbux has always been the original one in Pike's Place Market. That is, until I discovered Starbucks Reserve on Cap Hill! WOW! The first time I came here, I spent hours browsing, sipping, eating, chilling and people-watching! As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect spot for ALL of those things. "
,,,,,"The bathrooms here are unlike any Starbucks bathrooms I've ever been in before. Which is a great thing because when I'm hanging out there all day drinking coffee, there's definitely some...how do I put this? Movement. Ha ha! Just being honest. "
,,,,,"Try to avoid going there on the weekends, unless you like to wait in line. But I'm also the kind of person who likes lines. If there's a line, there's always bound to be some Seattle tourists, who I love chatting up. I moved to Seattle not too long ago from Cali, so I always feel like we're on the same page. I love to let them know the little secrets of my NEW hometown!"
,,,,,"When you think about how it all started just with some beans and a dream...it's really amazing, isn't it?"
,,,,,"I have never seen anything like this before and it is truly majestic and a coffee house mecca. The interior design is beautiful and the options for drip coffee is abundant although pricey. There is also artisan bakery and a pizza counter for those that fancy food and snacks. Despite the size of this place, it is still pretty hard to find a seat and I have visited this place twice already. "
,,,,,I hope they open more in the Bay area and in Asia! This is truly a beautiful concept and I really miss my delicious Starbucks drinks right now :(
,,,,,"Ah my first time trying their coffee and food. I think Starbucks is average but this place has a difference! Their dark chocolate mocha was great, perfect taste of the dark chocolate. The food was great, avocado toast and cinnamon roll was a favorite. Super cool spot to come and look and grab coffee you can't anywhere else."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,This is a must see place! My goal is to visit all locations. The location was beautiful and clean. I had the smoked salmon sandwich and it was delicious. I also had the double chocolate chip cookie and it was delightful. This is a cool place to hang out and grab a quick snack. I love seeing all the machinery inside of the place.
,,,,,"Overpriced, mediocre, slow service, and ridiculously understaffed."
,,,,,"Expect 45 min to over an hour wait for mediocre food and coffee. Oh, and if you want a refill, get in line and wait an hour again."
,,,,,"Absolutely not worth the hassle, wait or price."
,,,,,"Better, cheaper, faster is available in any of the thousand odd non-Starbucks coffee houses in Seattle."
,,,,,"Great location and ambience. The four of us ordered two espresso martinis, espresso martini flight and the whiskey cloud. The drinks were delicious,  and well prepared. Only complaint is the price, $80 for 4 drinks is a bit steep, but probably to be expected in downtown Seattle. I would recommend and say that the whiskey cloud was outstanding!"
,,,,,"Tourists visiting Seattle, listen up - this is for you:"
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve Roastery is a second-tier tourist destination. If you have four days in Seattle and don't have claustrophobia, then by all means, go. But if you have only two days in Seattle, this is highly skippable. What would you be missing? Why let me tell ya, you cute thing you."
,,,,,"You'd be missing the opportunity to wait in line outside while an employee with the best enthusiasm $20/hour can buy yells out the same basic instruction every minute. Once inside, you'll be missing the crowds to the point where it's legitimately difficult to even walk (people holding a tray of coffee samplers as if they're transporting a faberge egg, families behind you/around you/in front of you screaming about what kind of croissant looks good, etc.). Most importantly, though, you'll be missing the sky-high prices. If you have a family of five, expect to pay close to $40 for them to drink, essentially, coffee -- and that's before food. And finding a seat feels like Simba finding a rock to sit on during the stampede in Lion King. Ugh, hurts so good."
,,,,,"I never fully understood the lure of this place. Sure they have, like, vats and conveyor belts, but unless the place comes with an episode of ""How It's Made"", I don't get much out of it. So I'm left judging the faces of the roastery operators to see if they look smart and determined. The last guy I saw there working a computerthing furrowed his brow at just the right angle that I didn't mind paying 4x the price of what coffee should be. And neither should you, cutie."
,,,,,"The Food is Extremely Good, I give it a 5 for a very enjoyable Casual Dining Experience.. it's not a Michelin Star Resturant by any means.. But for what it Is, it's really really tasty.."
,,,,,"Expresso Flight, way way worth it!"
,,,,,"Wow - I'm obsessed. Traditional Starbucks have never been my go-to but we heard it was must to stop by the reserve. The overall experience was so cool, they had a ton of food options, unique coffees, an employee roasting coffee before you're eyes, PLUS a coffee cocktail bar! My new favorite drink was the whiskey barrel aged cold brew. Was in seattle for a conference and walked each morning just to get it!"
,,,,,"Came here when it first opened several years ago and now again during post-COVID times. I have to say, it's made great improvements. They are much more organized now, with multiple lines for different needs - drinks, baked goods, souvenirs, etc. There's a worker that manages the line outside. He was really nice, because despite the long line, I saw him let people go into the store to use the restroom if needed. Once inside, the workers state you can't linger if you don't have a table by the time your drinks/food arrive. However I did not see this enforced at all, which I'm sure most patrons appreciated. We were lucky enough to get a table right away for our party of 5. We tried various drinks from their special menu that boasts drinks only found at the roastery, including a milk shake (!!), affogato, and special barrel aged cold brew. The drinks were much better than I experienced years ago. Not going to lie, the special fancy drinks we got a few years ago tasted like pretentious overpriced dirt water. But all 3 of these drinks this time were fantastic. The ambiance is new age modern/cool. We enjoyed our experience here. Definitely fun to bring first timers, coffee lovers, and Starbucks lovers. My dad used to be a small coffee shop owner, and he thoroughly enjoyed the experience. So did my sister and husband, who are both avid coffee lovers. And of course my mom and I were just in for the ride."
,,,,,Probably one of my favorite stops on my trip to Seattle -- just a very different and unique vibe at this place! Also really cool that there are only 6 Starbucks Reserve locations in the world so we definitely had to stop by the one in Seattle!! 
,,,,,"It was surprisingly not that busy when we went -- it was a Sunday around noon. We waited in line less than 5 minutes to order drinks, and found seats right away. We also got up and walked around, ordered food from the bakery area, and found seats right away again haha. It is really big and really interesting, and there are a lot more food options than I'm used to at a normal Starbucks haha. There is also a bar!! "
,,,,, 
,,,,,"I'm not much of a coffee drinker and don't even get Starbucks that often, but I just thought the Reserve was super cool, and factory-like. Would def recommend stopping here if you're visiting the area and planning to get Starbucks anyways!"
,,,,,Eeeekkk!! So many cool things!!! First off there are two levels and right when I walked in I was greeted by an employee and I was overwhelmed with all the things in front of me! I did not know where to start! 
,,,,,"Merchandise everywhere!! Oh yea, be prepared to try to limit yourself from spending. lol! I first went to the exclusive coffee beans that you can only get at the Reserves. The lady helped me pick out the espresso bean that my boyfriend asked me to help him get. They had quiet a few selections and yes they are pricey. She was very nice. It shows the latest roasting dates for each as well. "
,,,,,There were food bars to your own selection and the employee warms it up for you. It was really cool because there was a whole case full of food. Think a regular Starbucks case of food but X5!  From sandwiches to pastries. 
,,,,,There are cute little seating areas everywhere. We sat upstairs where the roasting happens! We got to watch the crazy machine do it's work in making the wonderful beans we drink. There is a coffee bar pretty much anywhere you walk do you can't leave without buying a drink and sitting down to enjoy the wonderful aromas along with the roasting machine at top. 
,,,,,Everyone has to come one to check it out.
,,,,,My first This place is amazing!! Everyone must go here at least once! I wish there were more like this all over!!
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,The reserve is definitely cool to stop by! The only issues I had were: the lack of seating- you end up fighting for spots. It is also a pricy for what you get. The inside itself is very cool and they do have some unique options. If you don't mind waiting around for a spot I'd still say it's worth the visit.
,,,,,We tried the espresso martini and the whiskey coffee. The martini was ok- a little bitter and very strong. I think the whiskey coffee was really cool and tasted pretty good!
,,,,,"This is the funnest Starbucks to visit, with all the roastery gadgets and equipment. The coffee menu is also more extensive than others. The coffee flight is a good choice to try different coffees.  This location does get quite crowded, so I would not expect to have a good conversation with anyone here, but it is a fun place to bring out-of-town friends and guests, even if they are not coffee fans...or Starbucks fans."
,,,,,"My first time here, and boy is it crowded and touristy.   I'm talking long lines, and long wait times for food, drinks, and a place to sit.   "
,,,,,"I thought the starbucks drinks we ordered were amazing.   The best starbucks drinks I've ever tasted.   My daughter had the whiskey barrel aged cold brew, which tasted incredible.   Tasted similar to a delicious coffee whiskey. "
,,,,,"I got a chai latte which again was super.   We got a croissant pannini, and a chocolate croissant, and both were tasty too.   "
,,,,,"Would totally love to come back for food and drink, but not if I have to wait 20 minutes in line to order, and 15 to get it.   Just don't have the patience for it.   (There are 3-4 real, authentic Seattle coffee spots within walking distance, so plenty of other options)"
,,,,,"I had my doubts that the Starbucks Reserve Roastery was as cool as people had told me it was, but I was wrong. It was actually a really cool experience, despite being pretty crowded! We did have to wait 20-30 minutes to get inside, but once inside there was a lot to look at. We somehow got seats (there aren't very many so I'd recommend getting your food and drinks to go unless you already have a table), and managed to enjoy our order there. I don't love Starbucks, but this place has unique drinks that I quite enjoyed! In particular, we got the cold brew malt. We LOVED it. It's something that you don't necessarily have to enjoy coffee to like! We also got the cold brew flight, which was good too. And to keep our coffees company, we had their smoked salmon and cream cheese on brioche. The cold brew flight and the sandwich weren't anything special, but I'd go back for the malt alone. The prices there are a bit expensive, but what else would you expect? Anyway, staff were friendly and helpful, the space was cool, and I had a good time. I'd definitely recommend visiting at some point!"
,,,,,"While we had a decent experience at this location, the staff appeared to be overwhelmed and disorganized. We only got half our coffee order at the main bar, and I had to inquire about the other half. One of the coffees in our Origin Flight was much colder than the other two. Additionally, at the Princi bar, we saw our avocado and egg toast sit there for a while before someone carried it to the done counter. However the food and coffee otherwise was great, and I would recommend stopping by for the tourist experience!"
,,,,,"Starbucks has safety Covid protocols that they adhere to. Courteous staff members. I like perusing the selections of pastries and sandwiches. This visit I selected the raspberry tart. It's a nice chill spot at the Starbucks Reserve if you're catching up with friends or grabbing a quick bite. This definitely hit the spot. The raspberries were fresh, custard was soft and delicious, additionally, the crust was buttery and just how I imagined."
,,,,,Cool atmosphere and if your a Starbucks lover it's a must. Great food and lots of drinks you just wouldn't ever get to try at your regular Starbucks.
,,,,,"The tiramisu is okay. It is soft and creamy, but lacks the kick of espresso. It is more like a mouse than a tiramisu."
,,,,,"The pistachio mortadella sandwich is has sharp salt flavor. The sand which could be shorter, like an appetizer, and sharper in flavor. Right now, it is too sharp for how long it is but it still could use more sharpness."
,,,,,I had to go because I love Starbucks. This one is visually appealing. Spent $30 on just 2 whatever tasting pastries and a cappuccino and hot chocolate. Both of which tasted a little watered down. Parking sucks soooo much and If I would've known that I wouldn't have gone through the trouble of visiting.
,,,,,"Always a great experience!  Sorry so late but this review was for my visit before the lockdowns for Covid pandemic.  Always great food and coffees!  Large variety of different pastries, sandwiches and pizza.  The coffee varieties are worldwide!  Beans from all over the world.  There is also a coffee bar, where you can taste different coffees.  Watch the bean roasting process!  Lots of tables and seating.  Enjoyed my visit!  Can't wait to go back when things get back to normal after Covid!"
,,,,,"What a great place!  Got to go see this place if you love coffee!  You can see the roasting process of coffee beans.  There is coffee tasting of different beans.  This place also serves wonderful sandwiches & pastries.  Lots of souvenirs for Starbucks and coffee lovers!   If you are in Seattle, you have to make this a place to visit and tour."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,My review is for my experience prior to COVID. Starbucks Reserve Roastery is usually on the list for all Seattle tourists to visit when they're in town. 
,,,,,The Reserve Roastery is divided up into 8 sections which include: 
,,,,,1. Main Bar - where coffee masters can suggest the perfect drink for you. Seating can be limited depending on how packed it gets. 
,,,,,2.  Scooping Bar- pick up fresh coffee beans to go 
,,,,,3. Handpicked at the roastery - gift shop to purchase souvenirs 
,,,,,4. Mixology Bar- Learn about the art and science behind mixology 
,,,,,"5.Princi- Grab baked goods such as pizzas, pastries and breads "
,,,,,6. Roasting Area- master roasters in action with coffee beans 
,,,,,7. Experience Bar
,,,,,8. Coffee Library 
,,,,,Some of my favorites here are the: 
,,,,,- Green Tea Latte 
,,,,,- Whiskey Barrel- Aged Cold Brew
,,,,,- Coffee & Truffle Pairing experience 
,,,,,"Great experience for a first timer to Seattle. However, now that I live here, I would skip going here all together given how crowded and packed it could get on busy weekends."
,,,,,Very cool place. It's a must try. They don't have very many Starbucks Reserve places around so come and check it out for yourself. Very many options to try out. I also had both their affogatos. The mint one and the regular one. I definitely prefer the OG.
,,,,,It's an experience in itself to visit this place!
,,,,,"A huge space with a roastery,Italian bakery,gift shop,bar area with coffee drinks,cafe with coffee flavors you will not find anywhere else and a great selection of pastries and sweets."
,,,,,We ordered-
,,,,,"Pastries-Cornetto al lampone (raspberry),cornetto al cioccolate (chocolate),custard brioche ,hazelnut tart. ( everything was yummy!)"
,,,,,Pistachio Latte (amazing and it has sweet citrusy notes too)
,,,,,Shakerato Affogato-espresso over Icecream (average)
,,,,,Prices are high but I would visit it at least once and taste the unique flavors available only here.
,,,,,Amazing Starbucks experience! The bar and cocktails are world class! The food is decent. So much fun to bring friends and family from out of town.
,,,,,Not your average coffee shop! Def a spot if you're a Starbucks fan or a tourist in Seattle and like coffee. There are some other roasters in town that have incredible coffee but the roastery is a staple
,,,,,"Came to see this Starbucks Reserve and the interior was definitely something worth seeing. They have unique drinks and baked goods specific to the reserves. If you're in the downtown area, I'd recommend stopping by."
,,,,,"This place is so amazing but also a little overwhelming. Got there right when it opened so didn't have to wait long. The history behind it and watching them brew is was neat. Coffee was good and the food was great. Plus they have an area you can order ""adult coffee drinks"" always a plus."
,,,,,Such a cool experience! You can try all sorts of different coffees and there's even a restaurant attached with sandwiches. The espresso martini flight was great! Extremely busy so make sure you take time to wait in the long lines.
,,,,,"Average. Maybe I'm missing something, but nothing all that interesting about this coffee. No subtlety. Mostly a burnt taste. I should have known better. "
,,,,,My mom said her latte was decent. But the cortado was extremely underwhelming.
,,,,,"I was in Seattle for a trip and one of my main goals was to visit the Reserve Roastery. This place was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had, and I was felt like a kid at Disney World in this place because I'm a huge fan of Starbucks and the Starbucks brand. "
,,,,,"The building itself is beautiful with three different sections- an area where you can order your coffee and pastries, the gift shop area with amazing souvenirs, and a bar-esque area where you can order alcoholic drinks and other things."
,,,,,Everyone working there was extremely nice and made the experience a thousand times better. I got the Whiskey Barrel Aged Cold Brew and a raspberry Cornetto and they were both delicious. I can't wait to go back to Seattle and spend some more time there!!!
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"The Roastery was definitely a pleasant experience!  It was packed however, and due to COVID precautions so finding a table was difficult but not impossible! Just plan out your visit as it is still a touristy attraction. I didn't have high expectations for the food/or drinks however I was highly amazed!! I got the Affogato ice cream and it was so sweet!! The espresso and the ice cream compliment each other so well I definitely recommend everyone try this item! Moreover my friends and I all got different breakfast sandwiches and were impressed! The sandwiches are all so different from regular stores and truly taste so much better! "
,,,,,P.S. my friend hates the espresso martini so maybe save your money and try a different drink...
,,,,,"A definite must stop for any visitors to Seattle- the store front is small but once you get inside it is very impressive.  High ceilings with lots of wood, brass, and cool coffee making contraptions.  The coffee is unique and definitely premium pricing but the experience is unbeatable.  I had the hazelnut Bianco latte and it was delicious.  They also have a nice gift store with unique reserve mugs, clothing, etc - everything is pricey.  The baked goods looked delicious and may be baked on site in the rustic ovens.  The bathrooms are super clean and unisex so be aware."
,,,,,So glad to check this place out! So many delicious food and beverage options and so cool to see the roasting process in action and watch it all happen. 
,,,,,"I had a cold brew float and a chocolate hazelnut tart, so tasty!!"
,,,,,"I love this place from their espresso martinis, to their fresh pizza. this is the place to go after work by yourself or with friends! The energy here is high and flowing I just love it here one of my favorite places"
,,,,,"Starbucks reserve seattle is a MUST visit. From cocktail drinks to meals, to coffee tasting and baked goods. The inventory is amazing. They have awesome gifts and awesome cups to get for yourself or for friends. My friends and I went to visit. My husband and I tried the two different affogattos which tasted great. We got some baked good and loved everything. The customer service was exceptionally amazing. The roastery side was not on at the time but I have been there before and I think it's the coolest thing to see. Vaccine cards are needed everywhere in seattle."
,,,,,What a great spot to check out! I have never encountered a Starbucks like this in my entire existence and Starbucks in California are nothing like this. I felt like I was at cool coffee factory. It was just a beauty inside with so many options to choose from. They offered exclusive only drinks and products which was awesome. I ordered the pistachio latte and my husband ordered some kind of macchiato drink which both were delicious. I never knew Starbucks even offered certain special ice cream drinks which was interesting to me. 
,,,,,"Unfortunately due to Covid my husband and I were not allowed to eat or drink inside so we had to go outside. They did allow us to explore and stay inside as long as we want. They also had a section of coffee bar where you can mix coffee with alcoholic which was very unique to me. I was just in awe mode so mesmerized by everything inside. The ambience, the decor, the vibes were just great!! "
,,,,,Bring one in the Bay Area!
,,,,,This Starbucks is unique. If you want coffee that you can't get at a regular Starbucks you need to visit a Starbucks Reserve. They have a lot of food options and you has different seating options. You can buy some unique items that is only at the Starbucks Reserve as well. I got a cup of the Pantheon coffee. It's a Starbucks Reserve exclusive coffee. It was a good cup of coffee. I wasn't blown away by the coffee. The prices for the coffee and everything was a bit pricey. A bag of the Pantheon coffee is $24. It's  a must visit place.
,,,,,Always crowded.  Mostly tourists.  You might wait 20-30 minutes to purchase and receive a $7 cup of coffee.
,,,,,I went here a few months ago and the coffee and food was good but they seem to run out alot and don't tell you even after watching in line for awhile and it's extremely full all the time. But other than that it's okay .
,,,,,"Im a Seattle area resident, so this review is kind of for the tourist the folks not from our area. I drive over 65miles to come up here, my and family visited today from NE Thurston County, we picked up the rest of the family in SW Pierce county. Starbucks reserve is NOT a regular Starbucks. Heres my FYI and official ""heads up"" plan on restaurant type waits. You're experience will be NOTHING like a typical Starbucks. Reserve has more than a few concierge staff that are there to greet and assist you. We got help today by being directed from primary register to a back up to place our order. Now, we wanted to try some of their drink options of a more adult persuasion. If that's what you want to do, head in the front door and go RIGHT. At the bar, you will find the coffee whiskeys and martinis etc. There is also food to the right, so no need to wait in the much bigger line that is on the left. We we nt on a very iconic overcast showery day in Seattle so the drink, coffee and food mix seems perfect on the day. I got the Roastery Old Fashioned, my brother in law got the Reserve Boulevardier and the ladies got the Cold Brew floats. Each of us paired that with either the Ham and Cheese Croissant or the Breakfast Salmon and Cream Cheese of Brioche. As I said this NOT a typical Starbucks, the experience is well above average and I recommend it for mature adults who are fans of a typical Starbucks, and even for those that aren't. You'll have plenty to choose from whether you're looking for , coffee (its the best Starbucks offers) drinks, treats, cocktails, wine, beer, breakfast and regular sandwiches. The very first coffee I got here years ago was so hot, it took well over 20 minutes to fully cool down, I got the coffee downstairs where they make custom coffee blends. The baristas running the coffee bar downstairs know there product quite well, and it ads to the enjoyment."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I had never been to a Starbucks this fancy before coming to this location. They have so much merchandise to choose from! As soon as you walk in you smell coffee and the yummy hot sandwiches being made behind the glass. Love their featured drinks menu.
,,,,,Superb espresso martini!! My fave was the chocolate. 
,,,,,The salmon and lox was tasty. I will always return with coffe lovers.
,,,,,"Tried the coffee here for the first time and we had a blast sampling delicious coffee! We enjoyed Hawaii Ka'u, which was very bold just how I like it. The Sun-Dried Yirgacheffe Chelelektu was more fruity and citrus which was enjoyable. The Hacienda Alsacia was like muddy water, bland and boring. Next, we will definitely try the bar!"
,,,,,"This place isn't a coffee shop. It's an experience. Walk to the back of the roastery and you can see the assembly line and machinery packaging coffee beans. To the right corner of the roastery, you can purchase pastries and coffee inspired cocktails! I didn't get a chance to try them this time, but hopefully next time I'll have the opportunity."
,,,,,"The pistachio latte super sweet and creamy coffee drink. You hardly taste the coffee but you can really taste the thick and creamy sweetness in the drink. If you're more of a coffee person, def do NOT get this or any kind of drink that sounds like this."
,,,,,"Visited here in summer at peak tourist season. Long wait outside. Cool to see the beans but we didn't get much explanation on what anything was. What really soured my experience was the drink I got--I got the whiskey barrel-aged cold brew for $10.50. I'm normally a cold brew chugger but this was really hard to drink--instead of notes ""chocolate, stone fruit and oak"" all I tasted was expired fruitcake. Not worth the price nor the novelty."
,,,,,"So disappointed with the roastery today. The last couple of times I've been here I've enjoyed myself despite the ridiculous wait times. Today my husband and I went and ordered food at the Princi bar and also ordered drinks at the main drink counter. Both took a long time, but the drinks took especially long. Generally I can deal with the wait time considering this is a pretty popular place, but the whole experience was frustrating. I got a clover brewed Costa Rica blend which was fine, but I asked for room and they barely gave me any. I went to add half and half and it was so full it was spilling everywhere. Of course the self-serve bar said not to eat/drink there so I couldn't sip my drink until it was manageable to carry back to my table. I saw other people struggling with overfilled mugs as well. So frustrating!"
,,,,,"I finally met back with my husband who was waiting with our food. I got a pancetta egg sandwich and when I took the first bite, the yolk exploded all over my hand and table. I love a good over-easy egg but who thought it was a good idea to have an over-easy egg in a sandwich?! How are you supposed to eat that?? Anyway I was already frustrated and that just pissed me off more. My husband had much better luck with his choices. His matcha latte was good and his smoked salmon brioche was tasty."
,,,,,"Love the atmosphere here, but damn they really pissed me off today!"
,,,,,"Pretty cool place! Lots to look at, from the fancy interior deco to the many things for sale to the drinks. I had a gift card so I ordered the matcha latte with an almond cornetto. Both were very tasty, can't go wrong with matcha and the cornetto was basically a croissant with almond flakes and almond filling, very very buttery and layered! "
,,,,,"It's kinda expensive as expected from a Starbucks reserve and kinda underwhelming. Worth going to once but if you don't have a gift card, I would pass on getting a drink."
,,,,,Wow amazing experience!
,,,,,The whiskey barrel cold brew is an explosion of flavors and the best cold brew I've ever had!
,,,,,40$ for 8oz if you want to take a bag home
,,,,,"Also try the Roastery old fashioned cold brew whiskey, it is freaking amazing!"
,,,,,I love the roastery! So many unique drinks to try and I love all the flight options as well. Weekends are busyyyyy so weekdays are my favorite. Service is always nice too! I love the shakerato and my husband likes the nitro molé mocha!
,,,,,"The coffee is great...it's just such a sloooooooooooooooooooooow process. If there are 6-8 people in line, it will take EASILY 15 minutes to get to the front to order. I've attempted to drop in for coffee 4 times in the last few months, 3 of those times standing in line for 7-10 minutes without MOVING. This last time I popped my head in, saw the line, and left. They have ONE person taking orders/money. This is just the dumbest system. Why don't you take the friendly dude greeting us as we walk in and put him behind a cash register?  Better yet, why don't you sell a certain collection of drip coffee over to the right where the food is?  ANYTHING to speed up this painfully slow experience. "
,,,,,Sadly I won't be back. It's just not worth it.
,,,,,I'm from Chicago
,,,,,I think our starbucks reserve and roastery is the most beutiful in Michigan av.....
,,,,,anyway i also  visit the Starbucks reserve and roastery in nyc mmm i don't like it neither 
,,,,,anyway 
,,,,,well this in seattle is
,,,,,ok I walk from belltown to it
,,,,,I'm a coffee  aholic I have too much coffee  in seattle  this time I've a ham cheese on croissant & shortbread cookies for my son
,,,,,I also want to try the coffee martini but I forget my ID
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I'm glad I got to come here. There was a line, but it moved steadily. Once inside, you can purchase drinks, pastries, or merchandise. I was a little overwhelmed by the long list of drink offerings, but  ended up with the nitro mole mocha. I would prefer it to have more mocha and less coffee. I also tried the whiskey barrel-aged cold brew. I didn't think I would like it, but it was quite good. Finding a place to sit can be difficult, but we got lucky as were standing at the right place at the right time. When I come back next time, I would have to come earlier in the day. I had a hard time sleeping that night."
,,,,,Wow. What a cool place to visit. 
,,,,,I've been here each time I visited Seattle. I would say this should be on a top priority list of places to visit even if you are not a coffee fan. 
,,,,,"There are three areas you can order coffee. One is the mixology stand where you can order alcoholic coffee mix! Also, there are plenty of light foods you can order. "
,,,,,Decent amount of seatings even during pandemic (we visited during a weekday lunch time). Lots of cool gifts you can pick up too.  
,,,,,There are machines at work which you can easily see and be in awe of. Order a coffee or a flight of it and just hangout! Perfect place to seat and plan out rest of your Seattle trip.
,,,,,Best Starbucks with quality drinks and atmosphere~
,,,,,"Almost like a library in here, there is a gift shop, roasting station, and a pizza oven inside. "
,,,,,"Menu is very different from your typical Starbucks, including cold brew flights, classy cocktails, desserts, and pizza. "
,,,,,"By BF and I stopped by here around 11:30 AM, very crowded for a Friday and waited for an hour."
,,,,,Seating was quite full but luckily we were able to snag a table.
,,,,,"We got the clover brewed ($5), butter croissant ($4.5), salami sandwich on focaccia ($8), and cannoli ($6.5) to share."
,,,,,My Bf was still hungry so he got the he got the mushroom pizza ($8.5) later.
,,,,,"Order took a little while since it was busy, food is a bit on the pricier side for the portion, but def worth visiting once."
,,,,,"The coffee had a good flavor, rich and not bitter at all, 10x better than your average Starbucks black coffee."
,,,,,"The croissant was okay, would have been better warm but liked how it wasn't too greasy."
,,,,,"The salami sandwich wasn't overly salty, surprisingly light for a cold cut sandwich, light on mozzarella as well. "
,,,,,"The cannoli was the star! Cream was super thicc, although it was rich, the orange peel and the crunchy shell exterior made it a balanced dessert."
,,,,,10/10 would order again.
,,,,,"My BF said his pizza had rich mushroom flavor, little thicc on crust but super filling."
,,,,,"A must visit place in Seattle, although wait can be very long, a super classy place to drink coffee and grab food."
,,,,,Love.
,,,,,Delicious.
,,,,,Ambience is amazing.
,,,,,Barista knowledge is impeccable.
,,,,,Good was great. 
,,,,,Amazing experience. 
,,,,,A must go.
,,,,,"Starbucks fans this is a must stop in Seattle! Absolutely love coming here to discover the unique drink blends. Head to the bar for a variety of coffee and teas blended into cocktails you'd never imagine. Recommend the Cold Brew Spiced Rum - it was surprisingly refreshing, at first glance seems like a fall drink but each sip started to taste like summer. And the Sparkling Sakura Allure was beyond delicious with a great combination of green tea and citrus. Also, garb a quick bite at the Princi Bar. Just so you know, there's so much to choose from! I went with the Margherita Pizza, it was good maybe a little more cheese would've made it perfect, some pieces just had tomato sauce. Finally, can't leave without some shopping! They have a variety of merchandise you won't find anywhere else. Overall, I would come back here again, it's made it to my favorites."
,,,,,The line to get in was about 30 minutes but it wasn't so bad. Inside there was plenty of seating but people camp out for quite a bit (we did too)! There's a specialty menu. I really wanted to try the cold brew but of course cold brew isn't usually decaf (it was after 6 pm). I got a decaf cappucino. I liked the experience but I don't think I'd go again unless an out of town friend really wanted to go!
,,,,,"I'm a Seattle tourist so I was told to check out the Starbucks reserve over the first Starbucks. There was a long line to get in but actually passed by very quickly and we were inside in no time. Once instead, the Starbucks is huge and menu items and drinks which you do not find a typically Starbucks. We got this coffee with ice cream in it, it taste as it sounds. The have a decent amount of seating and sell Starbucks apparel though overpriced ($70 for an apron) and they also have bathrooms"
,,,,,"Feeling Posh and excited to see all that glitters is gold turned espresso. Hmm, how to best describe this luxurious design, rich in detail for your senses that was well thought out for us all to experience. You have to visit multiple times to be able to take it all in, especially when there are many other admirers present. Make note and save to spend because this location has both beverages and merchandise that are exclusive. High quality is worth what you pay to complete your trip and take something away. "
,,,,,"I was told Tuesday November 3rd, 2020 - today - their Christmas would arrive!!!"
,,,,,"Go get some! Woo who, thank you Starbucks for making such an enjoyable places for all my senses."
,,,,,"There are so many great pictures already posted but this visit, "
,,,,,"Thursday October 29, 2020 was very low on attendance so got a few clear shots. There is very limited seating due to our current Pandemic but all the offerings are as Golden as ever!"
,,,,,"Highly recommended stop while your in Seattle.  Get the cold brew whiskey drink, lattes were better than the regular Starbucks."
,,,,,"Ok, having visited Chicago first, I head my hopes up knowing this is the mothership area. Walking in, it was a beautiful space... then I realized, this is everything. Going during Covid restrictions made it even more interesting as the tables were all taken and it was packed. Even without restrictions there was not a lot of space to sit , have a cup, have a bite. "
,,,,,"If you are looking for a neat place to check out and buy some cool Starbucks swag, you found the place.  Besides, it is part of the Reserve trifecta."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Yes, things are pricier here but it's also a unique experience/atmosphere. Customer service was great. There was a long line outside when we arrived around noon. No shade to stand in where the line forms, so be prepared with a hat and some sunscreen if it's a sunny day! A worker came out to tell us about what to expect when we're inside and to answer any questions we had, plus to give us the QR code to check out the menu before it was our turn to enter. There's also a staff person at the front of the line who mans the door and lets only a certain amount of people in at once (safety first) l, and in case you have any questions."
,,,,,Knowing what you want before you enter will save you and others time so I definitely recommend doing so.
,,,,,"I had the barrel whiskey cold brew (no actually whiskey/alcohol, but does smell like whiskey and tastes like sweet whiskey coffee--better than I expected actually) and the espresso martini (sweeter than whiskey cold brew; you can have this as a dessert). I liked the whiskey cold brew the best but would recommend them both. I drank the martini before the cold brew, but wish I drank the cold brew first (or order it to-go after finishing the martini) bc it had ice and by the time I finished my martini the ice in my cold brew watered my drink down a bit. My friend had the nitro cold brew mocha and said she liked it a lot. I tasted it and found it to be a lot less sweet than the whiskey cold brew and espresso martini. It's good for anyone lactose intolerant and would prefer something creamier and subtly sweet. "
,,,,,"If you want your drink in a glass (not in to-go cup as pictured with my whiskey cold brew) you'll have to have a table first. Same for the cocktail bar. They said you need to secure seating before you order from the bar and have signage saying this, but tbh they don't confirm it with you and you pick it up from the counter yourself anyways..do what you will with that info. However I think this rule does make sense though, because your drink would come in glassware... and if you're just walking around the place with glassware (and it can be slightly crowded in areas)...well that is just a recipe for disaster! But yes, something to keep in mind especially if you are excited about the aesthetics of the drinks/food. "
,,,,,"You can use the Starbucks app to pay for bar drinks but it's not recommended it as you won't earn reward points for alcoholic purchases. Like the food and drinks, the merchandise is very cute, but also pricey. Overall the place was smaller than I expected but still beautiful and unique. I would say it's worth a stop if you're visiting from out of town!"
,,,,,If there's anything I need to say : THEIR HOT COCOA HITS DIFFERENT. 
,,,,,Love it. Better than the original Starbucks. 
,,,,,"This is such a cool spot. There's a bakery, beer place, and food with pizza. They sell touristy items and have a section for study + sit down."
,,,,,Like Disneyland for coffee: a ride for everyone. 
,,,,,They have drinks and food options unique not only to Starbucks but to good cafes as well. See pics!
,,,,,Must go for foodies and coffee nuts.
,,,,,First off I would like to start by saying I am not a fan of Starbucks coffee at all. I used to be obsessed with them during my high school and college years but have grown to prefer independently owned artisinal coffee shops more. But this place is so much more than your typical Starbucks. 
,,,,,They have a pretty huge selection of Princi goodies and every pastry I had was so delicious. I had the smoked salmon croissant and a raspberry tart the first time and both were as good as any high end cafe. Later on I added the olive sfilatino and the raisin girella and they ended up being my favorite.
,,,,,For the drinks I ordered the espresso martini flight and they were pretty strong but the flavors were delicate. They were also super cute. Later on I also ordered their whiskey barrel-aged coldbrew and that was pretty expensive. It was $10 for a relatively small cup. You can definitely taste the whiskey from the barrel so that was unique. But I don't like my cold brews to have any sweetness to them. 
,,,,,I really hope we get a Starbucks Reserve in socal that also has the Princi bakery. That would be super awesome.
,,,,,Don't forget to pay with your Starbucks card or at least scan your card for point. Stupid me I forgot and I already paid for my Coffee Experience. I felt rush through to order and pay that I forgot I can pay with my app. And they didn't remind me either.
,,,,,"This was my first time at a Starbucks Reserve Roastery, and I absolutely loved it. This is the first of six around the world and I would recommend stopping by here for a brunch at the start of your day! I don't often go to Starbucks but if there was a Reserve Roastery in California, I would go all the time. The worker at the front of the line recommended the Raspberry Cornetto, and that was probably the most delicious pastry I have ever had. I liked cold brews, so I tried the Cold Brew Trio flights. The Whiskey-Barrel Aged Cold Brew was very strong and I could taste the notes of whiskey and chocolate. The other two cold brews were also great!"
,,,,,It's pretty cool in here. They have a selection of cups and mugs not available in other spots and the food is actually pretty good. I appreciated the pizzas on display. Not a fan of consolidation of pies to save space later in the day because that can affect people with allergies.  We ended up with their coffee/passion fruit/pomegranate drink. Weird as hell and not something I would get again but it was interesting. I'd like to see more of these around and maybe some kind of membership options to involve groups and do tastings.
,,,,,"Yes the line looks long but on a sunny Saturday with a 10 AM arrival, it took us an hour to get through the line, order food and drink and get a seat so it's not as bad as we expected. This experience is 50x better than going to the original Starbucks location. It's a cool place to sit in and just enjoy but the drinks and food were especially great and worth it. We got a couple breakfast sandwiches but they weren't super filling and the pizzas looked too good! We grabbed two slices and a strawberry tart. The pizza was intensely good and they had quite a variety. I had a mocha and cold brew flight as well as a vanilla latte shakerto or something like that and it was great! That the latte was our favorite but the cold brew was nice to try. The variety of drinks was surprising and we ended up staying here for almost 2-2.5 hours. Great for a first timer in Seattle!"
,,,,,"By far my favorite Seattle experience so far! I highly recommend doing your walking around/pictures/shopping first, then one person saving a table (get their ID and order) ordering a spirited libation and food as those lines are way shorter than the entrance line of non-alcohol coffee and pastries. "
,,,,,"I loved my fancy-schmancy Espresso Martini with Irish Cream and dusting of nutmeg! Definitely will be dreaming about that one! My husband enjoyed his Seattle Cider made with Seattle-grown apples. We split a Caprese Salad, Funghi Pizza, and Sicilian Cannoli- all super delicious! On my way out, I grabbed a Cold Brew Float to sip on the way to touring Seattle."
,,,,,"For such a fancy, expensive place the customer service here sucks at epic levels. The staff usually are a sullen, condescending crowd. Recently i  ordered a steamer that sat on the back counter while the baristas chatted. As one of them walked away I asked her to please hand me my drink.  She muttered ""someone will call your name eventually."" When I eventually got my  $8 drink it was lukewarm. I ordered it extra hot!"
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"First time in Seattle! As a lover of Starbucks, I needed to visit the reserve. Funny thing is that my cousin recommended their pastries more than their drinks and their lasagna and flatbread was soooo good! Their pastries are also bomb. Lastly, I still enjoyed the drinks, I wished I tried them with alcohol as they also offer it."
,,,,,Very small and nice place. Friendly staffing!! I was there just for the experience and to get a drink from the very first Starbucks!! 
,,,,,I also got some souvenirs!!
,,,,,Thanks for such an amazing experience!
,,,,,"This place was super cool. Kind of ran into it by mistake walking around the city. They have so many options to get freshly roasted coffee, to pastries, to sandwiches, to coffee flights. It's huge as well. They also have a bar with coffee flavored drinks. They also have unique drinks. They don't serve the regular Starbucks menu here. I recommend anyone visiting go to THIS LOCATION! Much better than the original Starbucks on pike market. Recommend people traveling skip that."
,,,,,"It's very simple: if you love coffee OR if you are visiting Seattle, you have to stop by,"
,,,,,"The Roastery is beautiful in a willy-wonka coffee factory way. The interior is beautiful. The food is great (they bring ingredients from Milan, Italy). The coffee is outstanding."
,,,,,"I am not a fan of regular Starbucks stores. Reserve stores, however, are special. They have different coffee, different equipment, higher-trained people."
,,,,,"This time I had a cortado, and I can say it was excellent."
,,,,,"The pineapple rum float might not taste like pineapple, but that shit slaps."
,,,,,"Tasty drinks, rush a table when you have the chance, order the pineapple float cause ice cream is life, and the food was a nice edition to round it out for those that don't wanna end up white girl wasted at a coffee shop."
,,,,,This is a Seattle must see! 
,,,,,"They have a coffee bar with every kind of coffee brewing method imaginable, a full alcoholic bar, and an Italian bakery. Truly heaven on earth. I'm not a big Starbucks fan at all but I thought this place was incredible! Anywhere with both an Affogato and Aperol Spritz should be a sacred establishment. "
,,,,,"None of that dreaded Seattle ice was to be found here - the employees were all really passionate and helpful, even during this huge COVID surge. If you ask one of them about a brewing method, you can just see their eyes light up as they go into a five minute deconstruction of the process. I had a beautiful pour-over with a Kenyan roast that was suggested. It was really good! My friend had their holiday pistachio latte and she was head over heels for that drink as well. We picked up our drinks and then spent a nice half an hour or so exploring the store and watching coffee being roasted. "
,,,,,"This location is surprisingly much smaller than the Reserve in Chicago, but I actually enjoyed this one a lot more. It didn't seem like as much of a strictly tourist attraction. It's more quaint and intimate. It makes for an easy stop on a long day of Capitol Hill exploring. They have a big selection of cute merchandise too if you need souvenirs or just a little something to zazz up your coffee routine!"
,,,,,Definitely put this on your itinerary if you're touring Seattle even if you could care less about coffee. 
,,,,,I don't drink coffee because I actually can't (I get dizzy). But there's something for everyone here! 
,,,,,**Wait Times**
,,,,,Ranges from  25-40 minutes for entry. There would be little wait if you come on Tuesday/Wednesday. 
,,,,,**Drinks**
,,,,,I'm not a coffee person so I truly don't know. I still ordered the nitro brew mole + mocha because I got a sample of it at the 'first starbucks' on Pike Place and it tasted so good!!! So velvety smooth and chocolately. 
,,,,,I'm quite sure the Teavana is the same as others so I purposely ignored that and went for the most intense coffee ever...haha 
,,,,,**Food**
,,,,,"Princi bar is SUCH A TREAT! They have a whole host of bread, pizza, sandwiches, and pastries. Highly recommend the strawberry tart. It's a small slice for $8 but the strawberries were deliciously sweet! If you're with a group, just get everything to try them all! If you don't have a table, you'll only get these in bags/boxes. If you've found a table, the cashier would actually give you plates and a cute wooden tray. "
,,,,,**Merchandise**
,,,,,Lots of exclusive merchandise at the reserve! The designs are really good and I got some cups for myself. Again it's ironic because I really don't care about Starbucks but their merch are really good quality. They also have kits and devices to make coffee. 
,,,,,**Tours(?)**
,,,,,"None because of Covid. However, the roastery is functional and there's a person that explains the roasting process whenever the beans come out."
,,,,,**Parking**
,,,,,There are street parking but you could also park at Amazon Go Groceries for free parking with validation and walk a few blocks.
,,,,,"A Seattle visit definitely isn't complete without a Starbucks stop. After seeing how long the line was to get inside the original Starbucks at Pike Place Market, we decided on visiting this roastery instead that was a short distance away. "
,,,,,It's basically a very sophisticated Starbucks with a lot to see and sample. There was tons of merch/ souvenirs available for all you Starbucks lovers out there and a wide array of different food and drink options that are not available at your local Starbs. I was able to try the affrogato and loved the bitter yet sweet contrast and the pastries were very good as well! There is also a bar if you're feeling something other than coffee and the bakery section offered both sweet and savory options as well. 
,,,,,"For quite a touristy place the employees were still extremely nice and were extremely helpful, helping me decide on what to get as everything looked and sounded so good. Overall I definitely recommend making a stop here if you aren't able to make it to the original or want to experience a Starbucks you don't get to see everyday."
,,,,,"Worth a pop in here, if even for a quick coffee! The industrial equipment reminds you that Starbucks can be more than just your quick, I'm-late-for-work, drive-through!"
,,,,,Fellow yelper Thao could not have created any better review. I 100 percent agree with Thao and this place is a tourist place.  The hazelnut  latte is delicious but it is not 8 dollars and some change delicious.  It is like a zoo and no place to sit ever.  I was even afraid to order a pastry after my 8 dollars latte.  My gf ordered the whiskey iced coffee and it was 11 dollars and something.  I will not be coming back here again.  I am pretty sure I will not miss my 8 dollars latte.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Visited the iconic SBUX reserve early morning! The place is a great tour site, explaining all the processes of making coffee. The servers were nice, but unfortunately got my order wrong twice. The first time they gave me Strawberry instead of Blood Orange, and the second time they forgot the tea... Not pictured though is a much tastier Raisin Pistachio Girella!"
,,,,,"I'm so happy I got to visit this beautiful roastery. There are so many words to describe this place...cozy, posh, unique, luxurious... and I would agree, you totally get Willy Wonka vibes when you watch the roastery in action. "
,,,,,"I wish I lived here (like, inside the reserve hahaha) so that I could try every single drink and food they offer. I can be a dingbat sometimes, and I thought they would have the same drink menu that regular Starbucks have. Nope, lol, I asked for a Pink drink and the barista giggled at me and said, ""Uhmm, we're not like a normal Starbucks, are menu is very different..."" She handed me a menu and my eyes were like saucers. I settled on Pistachio Latte...omg, I'm so sad thinking about it because I don't have it in front of me. SO.FREAKIN.GOOD. And the presentation was lovely too. "
,,,,,"There were quite a few customers and not very many seats due to Covid19 precautions (totally appreciate their efforts!). We sat on the stairs next to the roastery (absolutely allowed and encouraged, there's actually a section for sitting on the steps) until we snagged a open table. "
,,,,,"Pandy taboo for sure, but I had to taste my sister's Espresso Martini, 10 stars, 100% recommend. "
,,,,,"I'm looking forward to visiting again, especially if we end up moving to the PNC. For now I'll enjoy just a regular old Starbucks drink in my very cool Seattle Reserve coffee cup. Side note, it was a little pricey, but I also wanted a souvenir other than a shot glass to commemorate  my wedding in Seattle :)"
,,,,,So what if it's a tourist trap?? WORTH it. This ain't your typical Starbucks!
,,,,,"Hubby and I arrived right at opening. No wait but still bustling inside. At first it's a little confusing, but there is a barista in front to explain how it works. When you step in, there's tons of merchandise. Really cool stuff. Even different types of coffee presses! "
,,,,,"To my right, there was a food line. There's a menu, but if you keep looking you can see a display. Brunch items and pastries. Keep going and there's the bar. Coffee and tea infused alcoholic beverages. To my left of the entrance, there's the drink bar. Go straight, and there's your roasting machines. There's not too many tables to use, and they have a down stairs with a little but more. All food and drink items are packaged ""to go"" unless you already have have table. It is wheel chair accessible. Although the first floor and second is a few steps down, I can really appreciate the mini elevator to accommodate everyone!"
,,,,,The food and drinks we tried where phenomenal. NOTHING like the usual menu. I got eggs in purgatory with the custard brioche. The eggs were so savory and tart. I was in love. Loved the fresh basil. My hubby got the fritata and tiramisu. It was so fluffy! 
,,,,,"We got the expresso martini, cold brew flight, and an affogato. All must tries! The whiskey aged coffee smells so dangerous it almost scared me  it really has a whiskey smell."
,,,,,Its a must stop when you're in Seattle!
,,,,,"Highly highly recommend the cold brew malt, which is cold brew with ice cream. Start by drinking it as is, so you can taste both the cold brew and the ice cream. Afterward, mix it well and you get this beautiful mixture of creamy coffee. There were some tables to sit, but my friend and I ended up just sitting on the stairs next to the roasters, and it was cool to watch the beans getting roasted. Would definitely be back!"
,,,,,"I'm not a fan of Starbucks, but I am a fan of the Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Seattle. This place is huge! Only Starbucks could afford to make a bougy roastery like this. There are several areas for food, bar, and coffee."
,,,,,Food:
,,,,,1) Prosciutto Sandwich - Delicious sandwich but nothing special
,,,,,2) Smoked Salmon Croissant - good light sandwich. nothing special
,,,,,3) Chocolate Hazelnut Croissant - Delicious. I wish it was warmer so it would ooze more as you bite into it. Great pairing with bitter coffee
,,,,,Drinks:
,,,,,1) Citrus Sparkling Espresso - very refreshing caffeine kick. I'd order this again
,,,,,2) Nitro Cold Brew - very smooth.
,,,,,100% worth the trip if you are a coffee/Starbucks fan. The actual roastery has a really cute vibe. You can see the coffee being roasted and packaged etc. they also have a Milan based bakery that provides the food part. We got some pizza and it was decent. The baked goods looked delicious. We also got an espresso martini flight and an espresso flight. The martinis were delicious! The other coffee based drinks were also very good. You have to find your own table to be able to order drinks there. If you don't find a table you have to get it to go so you can't get any of the alcoholic drinks if you don't find a table. There was a line when we got there it probably took about 15/20 minutes but it was worth the wait. Really enjoyed the experience.
,,,,,"I got the cold brew flight with the whiskey barrel aged. If I went again, I wouldn't get the whiskey barrel aged again. It was a bit strange for me - it smells like whiskey but tastes sweet. My friend ended up liking it after awhile, though, so it's definitely up to personal preference. It's super touristy and the coffee isn't the best but was still a good experience!"
,,,,,"This Starbucks roastery is awesome!! They have two floors with food, coffee, alcoholic beverages, and souvenirs. I got the espresso martini flights... not my favorite they were extremely strong with both coffee and alcohol but the experience itself was great. This roastery is one of six in the whole world. Definitely recommend if you are visiting Seattle. :)"
,,,,,Giving this place five stars simply for the nostalgia of it being the first Starbucks ever and it's on Pike Pl.  now I understand why they have Pikes coffee! 
,,,,,Long line to get in to a very small store.  Worth the wait to grab nostalgic coffee cups that have original Starbucks logo and literally say the first Starbucks store too. 
,,,,,This is mandatory stop for a coffee fanatic and a tourist in Seattle.  
,,,,,Can't give them anything less than a ten! It's the first ever Starbucks guys! Come on!
,,,,,Such a great experience! Staff was extremely nice and helpful navigating the large menu! Will be back my next time in Seattle

,,,,,"Starbucks isn't really my thing. Waiting in line to get into Starbucks definitely isn't my thing, but my wife loves Starbucks.  We finally got in and it wasn't too packed inside...because the crowd is waiting outside in line to get in, lol. "
,,,,,"If you want to order from the bar, you need a table and getting a table was a challenge. You have to stare down people until they leave or continue to ask them if they're done. Starbucks really needs to increase their seating capacity. "
,,,,,"Once we finally got a table, I got the Old Fashioned and it was absolutely delicious!!! My wife thought the same of her chocolate martini. The salmon toast was also very good. "
,,,,,"Final thoughts, I would come here again...in fact, I did and will continue to do so because the food and drinks are good!!!! Only markdown is the fact that we have to find seats in order to get something from the bar and the seats are hard to get."
,,,,,"Pretty large location with retail shopping on the right and cafe ordering on the left. Menu is conveniently available by scanning the QR code, they also have a large standing menu you can see from the line. There's a lot of seating so make sure to stick around to enjoy your drink and food item. "
,,,,,They do have some items that otherwise aren't sold at all Starbucks. I had ordered the Nitro Molé Cold Brew and it was pretty good! Check them out for yourself and you be the judge!
,,,,,Not enough tables
,,,,,Beautiful inside 
,,,,,Staff nice 
,,,,,Cool to experience ; you can do tastes of coffee or get ice cream in espresso desserts with mint and vanilla ! They have also pastries sandwiches pizza soups ans its all good 
,,,,,Good food (though i left half of my order hanging from a table so if you find it let me know how it was lol)
,,,,,Due to COVID they have a limited in-person dining. I recommend getting there early enough to save a table so you can stay to get the full experience. 
,,,,,"Of our order, our favorite items were the raspberry tart, tiramisu and the quiche. The raspberry tart was subtly sweet and had a tasty crust. The tiramisu was AMAZING, we ended up ordering a second slice to share. The quiches are made to order and went well with their buttery croissant. "
,,,,,"As for drinks, we ordered the advertised seasonal drink which was the Irish con Crema. My friend did not like the flavor at all, but the baristas were happy to make her a new drink. Definitely friendly and knowledgable service. Overall we had a fun time!"
,,,,,This location definitely stepped it up as a Starbucks from your greeting at the front door to your entire experience throughout the brewery it's just amazing. All the barista and staff were very knowledgeable and friendly and ensuring that our first experience was a good one I'm giving us some background on location also explaining on some of the features that this location had such as a library a sitting area. 
,,,,,The cups that are offered at this location be where they will get you I ended up leaving with almost like $150 worth of cups because they're so pretty and you want to have them you don't be like me have some self control lol !!
,,,,,The menu offerings here are to die for ! They had me at coffee and alcohol! Seriously We came here at least 2-3 days out of our 4 day stay! I had a great time can't wait to stop here again !!
,,,,,"WOW! Definitely come for the experience. The Roastery has SO many different coffee options, as well as alcoholic coffee beverages and delicious desserts! I got the hazelnut blanc latte and it had the right hint of hazelnut within the coffee. We went on a really busy time/day (Saturday at 5pm) so there was no seating available to us. When I went on a Monday afternoon, there were copious amounts of seating so just plan your visit around the busy times! They had cool merchandise and different coffee machines that you can purchase. It was a great experience and seeing how the coffee beans were roasted first hand was amazing!"
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,Visited while on vacation. We had such a a great experience . The staff friendly and very informative. The entire drink experience was amazing . My fiancé is t much of a Starbucks fan but he truly enjoyed all the drinks this time around .
,,,,,"I very much enjoyed my trip to the roastery, one of my favourite coffees I had on my trip, the hazelnut bianca latte. The croissants were nice, didn't care much for the breakfast ones. My biggest complaint was the smell though, you'd think the place would be giving out coffee beans vibes but all I could smell was sewage water, the tap water did not taste good."
,,,,,"I thought I hated Starbucks coffee and all its burnt bitter offspring and hard dry pastries but this feels like a totally different place! The espresso martini flight is fun, but we had a few of the other drinks and they are truly good, even the ones that sound weird and even if you don't care about/like coffee flavor."
,,,,,"Also tried a nitro cold brew and it was really smooth and delicious. The snacks feel really fresh, my favorites were the tiramisu and a croissant with a dab of hazelnut. The tiramisu wasn't particularly rich like I like, but I really appreciated that it wasn't too sweet. The croissant was buttery and so chewy that it was hard to pull apart, but in a good way."
,,,,,"Worth the wait, even though hovering around a table is a bit stressful, but such a fun experience. All the merch is super cute too!"
,,,,,"Not the biggest coffee lover but after visiting the Reserve, I have been wishing to have a one here in LA! I didn't think coffee would be so special until I tried the cold brew malt. The malt was my favorite drink I tried. Not very malt-y but the flavors blended so perfectly. We also tried the custard croissant, hazelnut croissant, cold brew float, dark chocolate mocha, and the nitro cold brew. All were amazing! The pastries were great as they are made fresh in store. It was difficult to go back to a regular Starbucks menu after trying all the goodies here. "
,,,,,"Tip: Try to go early or you'll have to wait in line outside, 10-20 minutes depending on the day. Seating is also a little difficult. Our first trip we went around 8 AM and didn't have to wait outside, walked straight in and found seating right after we ordered. The next day we went around 10 AM and had to wait outside for a couple minutes and had some trouble finding seating for just two of us. It also didn't help standing outside in the heat but we did end up being there while the PNW was having a heatwave haha. "
,,,,,"Really nice interior, good service, and delicious coffee and pastries. Hope to be back to try more sometime soon."
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Great stop!! I'm a Starbucks fan and definitely wanted to check this place out.  We walked there from our hotel & took photos outside with the mural supporting Black Lives Matter!! Awesome.  We headed inside and I was just amazed at how big it was inside.  There's a coffee section,  alcohol section,  pastry/food section,  coffee brewing/grinding section, shopping section, and additional seating downstairs.  "
,,,,,I purchased coffee for myself and my mom.  I also purchased a tumbler.  I didn't get any coffee or food because we were about to go on a food tour afterwards.  I'll definitely make another visit when in the area.  Loved it.
,,,,,"The reserve is so cool! They have a large shop area where you can buy things like mugs and shirts and souvenirs. There are at least 3 bars that I saw, one is the cocktail bar and I split the espresso martini flight with a friend. The flights are pretty pricy ($24) but they're really tasty. The servings are small, as you would expect from an espresso flight. A great trip for those who love starbucks and those that aren't really Starbucks People but love coffee and cocktails. I've been twice: once during the day on a Wednesday and it was extremely busy and difficult to find a seat and once on a Friday night and it was way less crowded and there were plenty of tables."
,,,,,Chai Tea is very sweet!! And a great place to take pictures! 
,,,,,The Bar is very nice to look at and a great place to sit and enjoy. For breakfast avocado toast was recommended. My coffee of choice would be?? They have ice cream and espresso mmm.. and Pizza.
,,,,,"Cool place, great coffee, interesting stuff to look at. Kinda like going to a spirit tasting room but less intimate and everyone is buzzed up rather than down. Lol"
,,,,,What. A. Treat!
,,,,,"This place was an entire experience (totally touristy), and I'm so glad we went. "
,,,,,"My family and I split the Origin Flight and some breakfast pastries. That particular day we tried their various roasts from Vietnam, Costa Rica, and their Pantheon Blend. My favorite was the roast from Vietnam because it had an almost dark chocolate flavor and it went perfectly with the chocolate hazelnut croissant. All 3 roasts were incredibly smooth however. "
,,,,,"Would absolutely return, and to maybe even try out their alcoholic concoctions next time!"
,,,,,"I was in Seattle on vacation and was really excited to see this place ! I'll explain why I give this place 2 stars! So we came by the first day and had some pistachio lattes , avocado toast and pasta salad . Firstly the food was gross, stale , tasted not so good. Don't come here for food nothing tasted fresh. But the pistachio lattes are wow beyond amazing ! Beside the point that they are 500+ calories and $10 each ( which is really expensive)  I was really impressed and said ill splurge because I'm on vacation. Because I've tried pistachio lattes in the regular locations and they are gross but they told us they make it different there and it tastes different so we tried it and fell in love! basically the drink was the only good thing that's why I gave 2 stars , I came back the next day for another drink and  again gave a Second chance for the food had a lox croissant was dry again. Also The location is cool style wise but very packed with people."
,,,,,"Starbucks is everywhere you blink no matter where you are in the world. But Starbucks Reserve, these are hard to come by. They can only be found in Seattle, Chicago, and New York. Oh how I wish I had one of these at home. You walk into the door and you would think you died and gone to Starbucks heaven. It's absolutely adorable, modern, and clean!! It has both an upstairs and downstairs with ample seating options. There are several lines depending on what you want to order. If you want a pastry or savory sandwich, there's one line. And if you want a drink, there's another. This Starbucks has unique items that I've never seen anywhere else. Items like a prosciutto and fontina croissant sandwich, margherita pizza, coffee and espresso flights, pineapple rum floats, blush mint juleps, and many more fabulous items that I have failed to name. Please come to California very soon!"
,,,,,"Love this place! The food, the atmosphere just impeccable. The people working here are very friendly. the pasties are amaazing. I tried the hazelnut chocolate croissant and the raspberry croissant and they are both delish. I came back the next day for the hazelnut  one. I also tried the pistachio latte for the fist time. It's a fave spot now."
,,,,,Such an amazing experience at this Starbucks reserve! Its located in a busy area so there isn't much area to park around the street. 
,,,,,Inside you are welcome by nice staff explaining the procedures for COVID and ensuring that people are keeping 6 ft apart. There are lines and separators and staff telling which way to go to avoid bumping into each other. 
,,,,,"There is so much inside here! A bar, a little bakery, a store, a coffee roastint factory, and a coffee shop all in one! It was such a cool experience and I highly reccomend people to go and visit."
,,,,,"I ended up trying their whisky old fashion cold brew, pistachio latte, and nitro cold brew. Everything was so delicious! The whisky cold brew was surprisingly very smooth, slightly sweet, and came with a big clear cubed ice. It was a lot smaller than I expected but had a lot of caffeine!"
,,,,,"If you're looking for an unique coffee brewing experience from cold brew, nitro, pour over, drip, etc., this place is for you. "
,,,,,Husband and I are in town for a quick bites and coffee and ended up buying the coffee beans to go. The bourbon barrel aged coffee was amazingly delicious with a note of bourbon in the aroma but without the buzz so you can continue with your day.
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"No I'm not a coffee drinker (and don't even enjoy the flavor of coffee/espresso), but this place is actually kind of nice! It certainly made for a decent spot to grab an early adult beverage with a couple girl friends. "
,,,,,"My two friends and I arrived around 8:15pm? on a windy, cold Saturday and after showing the employees at the door our vaccination information made our way over to the line to order drinks. "
,,,,,"The line went pretty quickly and so did the wait for our cocktails/wine. Thanks to the cashier's/bartender's recommendation I went with the floral gin offering for my gin and soda. Dang it was pretty good! I would order again. (Not sure how much it cost exactly since my friend paid, but I'm assuming it was more than your average dive bar well gin + soda offering.)"
,,,,,"My friends and I swooped on an open window bar-table spot, and then thanks to an employee clearing a recently vacated high top table we went for that more centrally located seating option instead."
,,,,,The large high-ceilinged space is well lit and clean. The food offerings in the case look pretty good too! Is this an ideal location to mingle and meet a potential date? Probably not. But it seems to be a decent place for friends to catch up.
,,,,,"Worth a visit! Their menu is completely different from any usual Starbucks, and they have special drinks like whiskey cold brew and espresso dolces. The whiskey cold brew had the sweet notes of whiskey, and the passionfruit pomegranate espresso dolce was overly sweet and kind of nasty, unless you like jam + espresso. Also got the chocolate hazelnut cornetto, which was very flakey and filled with cream that tasted like it came from a Ferrero Rocher. "
,,,,,"The person taking my order was very patient despite the long line behind me. There is also an area for special merch, great place to pick up a gift!"
,,,,,"Awesome coffee selections, reserve flavors never seen in a local location, food to order, adult beverages and more!! Way way more."
,,,,,Amazing visit. 
,,,,,I enjoyed it a lot. Was like a Starbucks heavenly experience!!
,,,,,"YOU ALL ARE BLESSED OUT THERE IN SEATTLE. My friend and I came here a little past opening time and found ourselves in awe at the sight of this place - it's so spacious and beautiful, with its design so modern yet so industrial at the same time. I'm jealous! This would be my idea spot to study and do work if I had that chance to do so on a regular basis. I tried the cold brew trio flight and found myself victim to the whiskey barrel-aged cold brew - whatever you heard about it, it's true! It held a certain fruitiness and was smooth on the mouth! If I didn't know better, I'd order many, many glasses more of it! Considering the rarity of this Starbucks, I say dive in as early as possible here and indulge in the space and its drinks!"
,,,,,"I walked in the door and immediately said, ""wwoooowwww."" I was BLOWN away. I've been around and into coffee culture for a while, and this place was beautiful. "
,,,,,"The building is divided into a few sections. Most notably, a merch section, the roasters, and seating. I was stoked to see things on the menu that I've never seen anywhere else. "
,,,,,"Sparkling Citrus Espresso- I didn't quite like it at first, but I think it's because it was so new to me. I got more into it the more I drank. It was light, refreshing, and just a little citrus. It was like having a carbonated americano, and that's sort of brilliant. "
,,,,,"Passionfruit Pomegranate Espresso Dolce- before I received the drink, I thought you drank it in layers. The barista let me know to mix it for best results, and I wish they would have just done that, lol. However, this drink was exciting! The pairing of the fruity flavors with the bitter notes of the espresso and the creamy texture of the sweet cream all gel better than I expected. Would drink again. "
,,,,,Smoked Salmon on Brioche- this was good. This is what I most wish wasn't regionally specific. I could have at this at brunch anywhere and feel right in place. It was lovely. 
,,,,,"I loved the entire experience! Very glad I went here instead of the ""first Starbucks."""
,,,,,I AM A STARBUCKS LOVER AND THIS PLACE WAS HEAVEN!! 
,,,,,Soo many choices!!! 
,,,,,If you have a chance stop by and give it a try YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED 
,,,,,THEY HAVE EVERYTHING 
,,,,,THE BAR HAS ALOT OF OPTIONS!! I got the espresso martini flight which hurt my taste buds!!! I couldn't eat or think about eat again. I am not being dramatic.. if you love expresso you might like this just know it will be bitter and gross! 
,,,,,The bakery side of the reserve has some of the best goodies ever! All the fruit and creams are so fresh! Whatever it is you'll love it! 
,,,,,I beverages are also so unique and good I'd give them all a try!!
,,,,,Overall the most prettiest place ever and perfect for any coffee lover!!' You won't want to leave!
,,,,,"There are only 3 of these in the whole country, so you have to come to the home off caffeine to get to witness it first hand. You can see how Starbucks does its thing, from beans all the way to a cup of fresh coffee. It is a little on the pricier side, but they have menu items here that you won't find anywhere else. "
,,,,,"I got the Espresso Martini Flight which was amazing and worth going back for. Although you don't want to spend too much money, don't be surprised if you end up buying a bunch of merchandise on the way out!"
,,,,,"This coffee joint will give you an experience like no other. The attention to detail, the decor, the experiences and even the merchandise is all very desirable. I stopped by a couple times during my visit to Seattle, I just wanted to try everything :) The hosts really made sure everyone understood the COVID regulations and was super nice. "
,,,,,"The pistachio latte was to die for! By far one of the best I've ever had. I ended up purchasing one their exclusive coffees, one of the rarest in the world, Jamaica Blue Miuntain. I wish all Starbucks was like this one!"
,,,,,"This isn't your typical Starbucks with your typical Starbucks drink. It's mostly rich coffee grounds and different ways of having coffee. There are options for coffee with alcohol, ice cream, and flights of cold brew or espresso. I've heard of this place and was dying to try it! Once you walk in, the atmosphere is amazing. You are immediately surrounded by the smell of fresh coffee and fresh pastries. On one side, you have majority of the pastries/baked goods and a cold brew bar. On the other side, you have the main coffee section. Seating and items for sale are spread out throughout. Everything was freshly made and absolutely tasted wonderful. "
,,,,,I definitely will go back to try their other unique drinks. Highly recommend this place!
,,,,,This experience was wild. I love how huge this roastery is and how well crafted all of the flavors were!
,,,,,"The interior itself is stunning, so much to explore and so many fun things to try (and buy, lol). "
,,,,,"On my trip to Seattle I had opted to visit the roastery instead of the original for my coffee fix because, well.. just look at the pictures, she is stunning!!"
,,,,,The service was pretty seamless for the amount of people in here.
,,,,,I was able to try some of the tasting coffees and even took a bag of one home!
,,,,,Highly recommend going to experience this place for yourself.
,,,,,4.7/5
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Recs: whiskey barrel aged cold brew, breakfast sandwich"
,,,,,Highly recommend the whiskey barrel aged cold brew! Super interesting before- and after-tastes that I haven't experienced with other coffee. The cold brew was not bitter at all and a little bit sweet (but not sugary). 
,,,,,"Also ordered a breakfast sandwich with porchetta, egg, and salsa verde on ciabatta and it was AMAZING. "
,,,,,"The raspberry cornetto was tasty but not very unique and a bit underwhelming (very little jam, and I wouldn't call it a filling but more a dollop on top of the pastry)."
,,,,,"We were on vacation here in Seattle. Of course we had to visit this Starbucks. I'm a huge fan of Starbucks, not because they are necessarily the best coffee but their consistency where ever you are in the world. "
,,,,,"Restaurant. This place is amazing. You can tell that there was not a Penny spared when they designed this place. It's beautiful. From the old school travel destination board, to the beautiful piping in the ceilings, to the wood floors, and the 5 star restrooms. It's so hard to describe. You have to visit and witness it on your own. Like I state in all my reviews, you can tell how clean a place is but how well they maintain their restrooms. Their restrooms were pristine. That's amazing considering how many people were going in and out. "
,,,,,"Food- the food was amazingly good. My wife and I were a fan of the Salmon Croissants, the Italian Pizza, and sausage, feta, and spinach pizza. It was so good we went back for seconds. Even my small children enjoyed their food. Normally it's just cheese pizza for them. But they were jumping in on the croissant and the other pizza. That's why I had to go back because I didn't anticipate my boys eating the food my wife and I chose. "
,,,,,Service. Of course the service was 5 star. The door greeter some was refreshing to talk with. I can't imagine how awkward that position is to have to try to make eye contact and greet strangers. But he was very friendly and answered my questions about how much work went into building this place. The same friendliness was evident with the chefs by those cool ovens. They were pretty excited to talk about them. 
,,,,,This is a must visit if you love coffee.
,,,,,"This isn't your typical Starbucks -- by far my favorite coffeeshop. Came here two days in a row! There were so many option - tad overwhelming. We ordered the classic affogato, shakerato affogato, cold brew float, raspberry cornetto, chocolate hazelnut cornetto and prosciutto and parmigiano-reggiano on brioche.  "
,,,,,All three coffees contained ice cream; certainly different and very interesting. The ice cream adds the perfect amount of sweetness!
,,,,,Such a great experience people are so polite friendly it's not to crowded they make everything in front of you there's pizza dessert and drinks
,,,,,Very cool place to visit and take friends and family coming from out of town. Little pricy when it comes to ordering overpriced coffee already. But it's about the journey man.
,,,,,"Don't get this place confused with the ""First Starbucks"" (that's a ridiculous line to a regular SB)...and don't get this place confused with any other Starbucks or Starbucks Reserve. Period. "
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve Roastery Seattle is a MUST VISIT if you've never been, and if you like Coffee and booze. The line does move fairly quickly, so just stay in it. When we got in, we headed straight for the alcohol area (to the right). That's right...don't come for the coffee, come for the speciality drannnkssss!! "
,,,,,"There are so many different items that you can order, but you can't go wrong ordering an Espresso Martini Flight, or the Boulevardier. We had a great time wandering around and taking a look at all the goodies, and food options, but we were slightly pressed on time, and drowning in good conversation over good drinks that we ended up not getting anything afterward. "
,,,,,"Still, I HIGHLY recommend taking a trip here instead of the first Starbucks! It's fun, kids are allowed, and it's a neat experience that's worth the wait. :)"
,,,,,"I came here twice during my trip to Seattle in February and I loved it! It was such a cool experience just walking around and watching the roastery and staff at work. They have a pretty big area for merchandise and a bunch of Starbucks Reserve exclusive items such as cups and mugs. They have an extensive menu with Starbucks Reserve exclusive drinks as well. I tried the adffogato and omg, I was addicted. It was sooooo delicious. It came with a spoon, but I preferred to just mix it all up into a milkshake-y consistency before drinking it. I was hooked so quick. I still dream about it, DELISH! I love how the baristas give you a little note card to let you know what coffee was brewed for your drink. "
,,,,,"They also have another area that sold food. I think they had pastries, sandwiches, and desserts."
,,,,,"Very cool spot for interesting coffee cocktails, and baked treats. Love the Princi bakery, delicious croissants"
,,,,,"Just as I had expected based on my previous experiences at Reserve Roasteries from other states, this place was just as wonderful! Similar to other stores around the neighborhood, this coffee shop is definitely smaller than other Roasteries (one floor), but designed with a great amount of space and seatings. "
,,,,,"The service here is wonderful, and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!"
,,,,,This was on our bucket list and long due! We had some friends visiting from the east coast and decided go with them on a chilly evening! Some highlights from our visit are below. 
,,,,,- it is an experience and not just a cafe
,,,,,"- the roasting equipment, bronze/copper decor, princi bakery and the drinks menu make a perfect combination for a date night or a group visit"
,,,,,- espresso martini is a must try. I have never tasted a martini this good!
,,,,,I can't wait to go back and I highly recommend visiting if you haven't already
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This is a whole experience, awesome whether you're a tourist or local. Pretty much NOTHING like a Starbucks and more like a fancy bakery/bar/Eataly! They have cute merch that's often a collab with designers. There was a line out bc of covid, but once you're inside it's actually really nice because it's not crowded. They let in just enough people to fill up the seats/tables. "
,,,,,"I bought a cup and got a slice of tiramisu. The tiramisu was a bit pricey at $9, but it was prettty good, so about the same as I'd pay in a fancy restaurant. Their pizza/flat breads looked so good, I wished I hadn't already eaten lunch. I'll definitely be back!"
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve Roastery was a fun tourist stop on my trip to Seattle. The entrance is pretty grand with large doors that open to a bustling scene filled with coffee, coffee cocktails, pastries, roastery machinery display, and Starbucks merchandise. "
,,,,,"We tried the espresso flight. It wasn't exactly my cup of (coffee), but was still a fun experience. The pastries were delicious! There was so much variety to choose from. "
,,,,,"There isn't a lot of seating though, especially for big groups, so plan ahead if you're visiting with a lot of people and want seats available."
,,,,,"It's too crowded but they have so many food and drink options. It is always super hard to get seating but it is definitely worth it. They have so many more coffee options than other Starbucks and they have a ton of food and snack options. They also have a bar and alcoholic drinks! The espresso martini flight is great and my favorite. It's a set of 3 little espresso martinis, one with a lemony flavor, one with chocolate flakes, and one with an orange flavor. I like that they're all unique. "
,,,,,It is super touristy but definitely worth coming here instead of regular Starbucks to try something new. They also have a lot of cool merchandise. I love their mugs and cups and they have really unique things too. You can also buy bags of coffee that are different from the options at any other Starbucks.
,,,,,What an experience!!! This place is a MUST for all the coffee lovers out there! I've been to many coffee shops and tried endless different cold brews. This place...is THE place!
,,,,,They offer cute little flights of coffee. We went with the cold brew flight that pairs with chocolates - my two favorite things!! We opted in for sea salt caramel and dark chocolate truffle. Both were *chef's kiss* perfect!!!
,,,,,"The cold brew was AMAZING. Our coffee beans were from Bolivia, and let me tell you, the best nitro cold brew I've ever had. I wish I lived in Seattle because I'd be tempted to go here every day!! The experience is also a fun treat itself. They grind and bag the coffee in front of you, so it's interesting and fun to watch!"
,,,,,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF VISITING SEATTLE. I used to be eh about starbucks but reserve is on a HIGHER level. The pastries are freaking good like paris level good, I was loving this more than super popular Le Panier....drinks are great and so cool to see them roast beans. Better than a lot of craft coffee shops (i feel bad for saying that) but starbucks has the money and resources to pour into R&D for best coffee experience. "
,,,,,Highly recommend their Cornetto and matcha latte!
,,,,,"I must say, I prefer mom&pop coffee shops and I try to stay clear of corporate coffee but the bestie loves her some Starbucks, and what kind of tourist/best friend am I if I don't at least try it with her in Seattle of all places?! "
,,,,,I am shooketh! This Roastery is legitness. 
,,,,,Whiskey in my coffee?! Hell yea! 
,,,,,"It shares a space with an Italian bakery that has a bunch of goodies. The cannolis were delicious. Everything looked amazing, and everything I got, "
,,,,,! This is a definite must try if you're in the area.
,,,,,"This place was very pretty inside, it's a little confusing to figure out where youre supposed to go though- first I got a croissant at the bakery section to the right, but then I realized the coffee section was to the left of the store and they also had the same bakery items so I did 2 separate payments. There seemed to be not many tables and a lot of empty space, maybe because of Covid. I got a latte for almost $9 and a $5 croissant so it's expensive but you come here for the ambiance. Their espresso martini flights looked pretty cool, and the sandwiches & pizza also looked great. Would love to visit the other locations!"
,,,,,If you are a coffee lover even if you're not a Starbucks fan this is a fabulous experience. It is a more upscale/ coffee aficionado type of experience. I went on a hot July Sunday afternoon so there was a bit of a wait to get in but the line moved quickly and I think makes the experience better by keeping the crowd level down. My advice is to camp out by the Princi/ alcohol bar and wait for a sit down table to open up. My spouse and I did that so we would be able to enjoy the experience. We got two delicious sandwiches from the Princi counter and then I  waited for a table to open up which it did in about 15 minutes. 
,,,,,We then ordered the espresso martini flight from the bar and it was really a nice variety of martinis with different flavors. I also recommend going downstairs to watch how they roast coffee. 
,,,,,"The staff here was very friendly and explained the process. Also, you can earn stars here when you use your Starbucks card. The bartender said no, but I saw stars on my Starbucks card that I had earned. At the end after looking at all the cool items for sale I bought a 1/2 lb. of the Paradiesi blend which is exclusive to the Seattle Reserve Roastery. I tasted it when I got home from my trip and it is really special."
,,,,,"Love the decor. Hate the crowds, lines, long wait times."
,,,,,"As someone who only ever goes to Starbucks for my free birthday drink, I at least knew I had to visit the roastery as a tourist in Seattle. I tagged along, not expecting anything in particular, but was impressed by the grandiosity of the space."
,,,,,"Stopped by around 2pm on a Saturday and it was hopping. Thankfully it was only two of us so it was relatively easy to find a seat, but people were definitely watching out for seats and ready to pounce as soon as anyone got up. By the time we left later in the afternoon, it definitely emptied out a bit and there were more seats available."
,,,,,"I ordered the Nitro Mole Mocha and we got the Shakerato Affogato to split, as well as almond and raspberry croissants. I don't know much about coffee, so I'll just say the croissants were tasty and I enjoyed the Affogato."
,,,,,"Overall, a nice place to hang out and appreciate drinks and the decor. I wouldn't mind coming back, but would definitely want to try other local coffee shops first."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"This is definitely an experience. It's really interesting to see all the different coffee beans they have and the different merch they have for Starbucks. It's really big and watching the process of how we get our coffee is fun if you're a coffee lover. The pistachio latte was sweet and delicious! I love that you can't get it anywhere except the roastery, so it's special."
,,,,,Blush Mint Julep Cocktail! It had a star next to it so obviously it was fab! My pals adored it!! 
,,,,,"I tried the blood orange tea and the cucumber like spritz, I prefer the cucumber lime one for sure! The orange one didn't have much flavor? It was still good but I'm more of a lime person! "
,,,,,Absolutely will be back the only downer is the line has been pretty long recently be it a weekday afternoon or Saturday evening -- but they offer a nice refreshing cold brew sample while you wait in the sunshine and I think they're spacing out entry to enhance the customers experience and prevent over crowding which I appreciate!!
,,,,,"I will start this by saying, I am not a ""starbucks"" coffee drinker, i enjoy coffee, like a lot but not typical Starbucks. So stopping here was purely on the recommendation for others and i headed right over to the adult bar side when i got there. It was pretty crowded but the bar was empty so snagging a seat was no issue. The bartenders were so nice and went out of their way customer service wise for me and other patrons. I only had one drink, a cold brew and whiskey comparison and the cold brew poured over the whiskey was delicious! if all starbucks served alcoholic drinks i may be more of a startbucks drinker, until then i'll be a reserve roastery starbucks kind of girl lol."
,,,,,"My favorite spot in Seattle!  Many people feel Starbucks doesn't live up to the huge array of smaller coffee shops and their quality/flavors, but the Starbucks Reserve and Roastery is exactly what reminds me of why Starbucks is so successful and excellent."
,,,,,"Lines can be a bit long at times, and prices high, but I feel it is totally worth it.  If I have to work an extra shift, sure, let's do it to get this coffee fix on!  My favorite is their Barrel Aged Whisky Cold Brew, which has a full flavor and mild natural sweetness.  I even bought their bags of this, which was $40 each, but still worth it to have at home.  Also loved their Nitro Mole Mocha which was also fantastic.  They also have ice cream infused coffee drinks- of which my favorite is their Cold Brew Malt, and their Affogato was also solid."
,,,,,"There are only six Roasteries in the world, of which this is their main location.  You can watch them process the beans here while waiting for your coffee.  They also have an alcoholic coffee section and a bakery/cafe which serves sandwiches, pizza, and pastries."
,,,,,Overall highly recommend this place.  Came here several times on a short trip to Seattle.
,,,,,"I really liked the Reserve Roastery in NYC so wanted to check out the one in Seattle. Considering Starbucks originated here I was surprisingly small compared to the one in New York. On the plus side the crowds were smaller as well when we came on a Saturday evening and there was minimal wait-time to order. The menu items are the same, and the espresso martini tasted just as good. This time I also tried the funghi pizza which was delicious though took 15 minutes to come out, a little long considering it just needed reheating."
,,,,,"Although I'm not a huge coffee drinker (my wife happens to be), I can certainly appreciate the uniqueness and spectacle that is this reserve roastery.  "
,,,,,The area is large and displays the roasting process for the coffee beans (which you can of course purchase fresh here).  
,,,,,I was also surprised to see that they served hot fresh baked foods here as well at reasonable prices.  There's also lots of knick knacks and useful coffee related souvenirs that you can purchase here (though they're NOT cheap). 
,,,,,If you're a coffee drinker then you can't come here and NOT try their nitro brew coffee.  Despite not being a coffee drinker the use of nitrogen to carbonate the coffee gives it an extremely velvety texture which melts in your mouth.  Definitely a must get if you're visiting!
,,,,,The biggest downside (and I'm not sure if this is COVID related) is the lack of physical tables to sit down.  To dine in you need a table and if you come during peak hours be prepared to camp out and wait for a table to open up!
,,,,,I never knew a Starbucks could be this fancy !
,,,,,This building is beautiful!! Me and my husband got there expresso martinis which were Devine 
,,,,,This place is pretty magical
,,,,,"Woke up early to avoid the line and see this! Overall, great setup - I especially enjoyed seeing all the coffee machinery and beans. Smelled awesome. It was interesting to also walk around and see all the different kinds of merch - wasn't expecting there to be that much clothing! Coffee was also tasty (took a bit of time tho and pricier, as expected). Overall, glad I was able to go, but don't know if I would be this dandy if I had to wait in that line."
,,,,,"While visiting Seattle, what better way to end our trip than visiting the Starbucks reserve. When we walked in, we were surprised to see just how big the coffee shop was, and even more surprised to learn it had a lower level too. "
,,,,,"On the right side of the upper level was the bar where they served alcoholic drinks, as well as a space for their miscellaneous items they sold like tote bags and coffee pots. They even had a small area where they sold their beans by the scoop which was very interesting. "
,,,,,"Oh the left hand side was where they made their coffee drinks and pastries. I got the Blanca iced latte and my friends got a coffee adffogato and a matcha latte. My iced latte tasted good, but I definitely wouldn't justify the large price tag especially since I got a tall. It was also so full of caffeine that I got super jittery right after I finished it. My friend's matcha latte was so sad! It was full of clumps and didn't taste like matcha at all and it was really expensive too, very disappointed. The coffee ice creams were okay, the coffee itself was bitter and the ice cream was creamy, but it was incredibly tiny. "
,,,,,"Overall, the experience was nice and I've always wanted to visit a reserve, I'm just disappointed in the drinks themselves :( I have it 4 stars because I liked how my drink tasted, but the other drinks we got were subpar."
,,,,,I am not the biggest Starbucks fan but I am the biggest Starbucks Reserve Roastery fan! This Starbucks is just on another level!
,,,,,The environment and ambiance is so cool! They have a good amount of seating and even some books you can read. There is also nice Starbucks Reserve Roastery merch that they sell. 
,,,,,"There are a lot of unique drinks and even a bar within this Starbucks. I love their flights and cold brew malt! The food and pastries are also very delicious and aesthetic. The only con is that the food and drinks are a bit pricey, but totally worth the visit!"
,,,,,"If you're going on the weekend, there's usually a long line. I recommend going at 8/9 AM to avoid the line!"
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Hands down, the best coffee I have ever had. I came here to try the Whisky Barrel Aged Cold Brew and after I tried it, I didn't want to try anything else! It had the original cold brew taste with notes of whiskey and wood. There isn't actually any alcohol in the cold brew but they did have some other options for alcoholic beverages."
,,,,,"There is a merchandise section in the store where you can buy cool and unique cups and mugs. When I went, there was even a full suit jacket made out of coffee bean bags. Not for me but it was cool to see."
,,,,,"If you are ever in Seattle, this is a must try!"
,,,,,"Do not go to the original Starbucks. If you're going to line up, go to the Starbucks reserve roastery. The wait wasn't too bad. "
,,,,,"Once you go in, you're really taken back. First, make sure you get a table! Then, order your food and drinks. If you're going try anything, get the whiskey-barrel cold brew. It smells so good and super smooth!!!!!! We were very caffeinated after this. The wait for the drinks does take a while. "
,,,,,The food looks good but I would say it's alright. The wait wasn't too bad. 
,,,,,"After coming here, you'd think all the regular Starbucks....are just too regular lol"
,,,,,So cool and extremely whimsical. This place really takes artistry and dining to the next level. We will definitely be stopping by again for some libations. 
,,,,,"The staff is very kind and welcoming, the roastery part of the building is extremely clean and gives off some cool steam punk vibes. Great selection for coffee, espresso, etc. "
,,,,,There's a variety of different things to get here. I really enjoy them having some infused bar options as well. Don't pass this up!!
,,,,,"We were lucky that we chose a hotel downtown where we are in between downtown Seattle and the other part of the bridge which is the Capitol hill area. We walked to Starbucks Reserve on our last morning because we ran out of things to do. We visited the original 1912 Starbucks but I didn't feel the need to stay in the long line to buy a coffee. I figured this Roastery would be a better idea and experience since you can sit down and see wonderful Starbucks machinery and giant grinders. I was not wrong and we actually had a blast! My husband loves croissants so it was an easy sell. They call it ""Cornetto"" here by the way. "
,,,,,"I shared a picture of the menu because tall, grande ans venti do not exist in this place and the pastries have fancy names. Pro tip: Better be ready when you order as it will be hard to decide once you see everything in front of you ;)"
,,,,,"Let me start off by saying that although I do like Starbucks, I'm not a super fan. But the Reserve Roastery looked like something so different, I just had to come visit and see what this place was all about. "
,,,,,"When we arrived, we found the line wrapped around the corner. It was like waiting in line for a Disney ride. There was staff there just to direct the lines in and going out. The staff member outside was explaining how to navigate the store once we were able to get inside. Apparently they offer a ton of unique drinks you can't find at regular Starbucks, a cocktail menu (yes please!) and food featuring beautiful breads and pastries by a bakery called Princi. The inside is like being in the Wonka factory. It's a multi-level store, with a beans being roasted on the bottom level, and coffee, spirits, food, and merch on the mail level. Bathrooms are unisex and you can peer through the glass to the roastery as you're washing your hands.  "
,,,,,"This is a really neat concept and was really cool to visit. I was just sad that my family wasn't able to find seating inside so that I could order off the alcohol menu (they won't serve you cocktails unless you have a table/seat). Booo... We ordered a bunch of pastries, some sandwiches and pizzas, and they were all so yummy! I'd go back to the Roastery for the food alone! "
,,,,,"Merchandise was pretty expensive. It was crowded inside. But overall, it was definitely worth visiting on my visit to Seattle!"
,,,,,7/10 there was not much variety for merchandise 
,,,,,"6/10 Porto's style line up, one line for food and another for drinks and food"
,,,,,7/10 seating is limited and reservations can't be made prior
,,,,,"Cool to go check out once as a tourist,won't be coming back"
,,,,,Dang this place is absolutely insane for a Starbucks!
,,,,,"One of the original Starbucks Reserves, this is a must go for coffee lovers in Seattle. It's not too far from Pike's Place Market, so you can easily make a pitstop before or after Pikes."
,,,,,"The place itself is huge! It's like a brewery to be honest. You got multiple areas for seating, merchandise, bar and food. A little overwhelming compared to normal Starbucks but pretty crazy nonetheless. This place is always packed but lines move fast."
,,,,,My friends and I came here for the merch and the alcoholic drinks. They use coffee/espresso in pretty much all of the drinks. I got a one similar to an old fashioned and man was it tasty. The quality of the beans really shines through with the whiskey. Obviously prices are going to be a little more than what you're used to but at the same time you get what you pay for.
,,,,,"Overall, one of those places that makes Seattle a place for coffee lovers. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,"The 1st of 6 Starbucks Reserve Roasteries in the world!! Born in Seattle, December 2014. Wow! Felt like I won a golden ticket to see Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory! It's a swanky coffee bean factory with a cafe & tasting room with exclusive merchandise for sale front and center. What's neat about this place is the building dates back to 1920 and was originally part of the ""Auto Row."" Starbucks restored the 15,000sqft building to showcase its wood ceiling and concrete flooring."
,,,,,"Our alarms were set bright and early to arrive at 6:30am, 30-mins prior to opening. To our delight, there was no line at the door. We even waited in our car until 7am and only a few others trickled in before and after us. By 7:45am, tables were full and customers were already standing by. We stayed for about an hour."
,,,,,"We ordered the Origin Coffee Flight and Princi breakfast sandwiches and custard brioche. Smell, slurp, savor and compare! I really enjoyed this experience! The baked items were soooo fresh and delicious, unlike the packaged goods you find at your local Starbucks. No need to warm it in the toaster! The wonderful food menu is brought to you by Princi. Rocco Princi is an artisan bread baker from Milan, Italy, and his lineup is offered at other Roasteries."
,,,,,"Check out the bathroom. It's community set-up and very clean!! When you're washing your hands at the sink, you're not just looking at a mirror - it's a mirrored window! I thought I had double vision, but you're actually looking into the coffee ground packaging area. Very cool indeed!!"
,,,,,This place is so intriguing!! My review doesn't even cover it all. I just want to visit all of the Roasteries in the world now!!! Cheers!!
,,,,,"I came here one day to have a chill afternoon with a friend! I did bring some work to do, but was a rookie mistake on my part. This place is quite busy and probably not the place to be productive. I started out with a delicious pistachio latte and pretended to do some reading. Eventually I was over it, and got their signature martini. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Definitely worth the hype! If you're a fan of Starbucks, you know you have to come here but I'm just letting you know even with the crowds and tourists, the drinks are worth it!"
,,,,,I love love love this place . 
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle and love coffee , this specific Starbucks is DEFINTELY a must . I think this place should be on everyone's bucket list as the Starbucks here is just really a step above . "
,,,,,"The inside feels like a modern hipster brewery . I really like how you're able to see to e whole brewing action . B it the best part of this place is the variety of food you can order . Firstly , the drinks here cannot be found from your local Starbucks , there is no Frappuccino whatever but there is beer and out of this world selection of treats which are being hand made by chefs etc . "
,,,,,Awesome place and awesome coffee
,,,,,*avoid lines by going to this place after 3 PM
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"A great experience for a Seattle first-timer like myself. Even if you don't drink coffee, there is something here for you in the many Reserve-exclusive pastries and sandwiches. There is also an extensive gift shop and a bread bakery on one side of the building."
,,,,,"You get a map upon entry and can visit any of the various bars. You can order most everything at the Main bar, but will need to go to the other bars for flights, alcoholic drinks, loose coffee beans, and bread. "
,,,,,There's plenty of seating and space. You can also get a glimpse of the laboratory towards the back where they test new flavors and brews.
,,,,,"It was my last day in Seattle, so I went here over the weekend around 12pm on Sunday. There was a long line with about a 30 minute wait. This Starbucks location has food like pizza and they also have alcohol! It's different from the usual Starbucks."
,,,,,"Ok, so it was my first time here and the different lines were very confusing! I think there were 3 or 4 different lines! First, I went to the line to my left and eventually made my way to the line on the right side of the building. They sell different items here depending on what line you're in."
,,,,,"After I made it to the front of the line on the right side and middle line of the room (pizza, alcohol), they told me I need to reserve a table BEFORE I order if I wanted to dine there. That was frustrating since I felt like I was going in circles. Anyways, I ordered the SAUSAGE, GRILLED PEPPERS"
,,,,,"AND MOZZARELLA pizza, SALAME MILANO ON FOCACCIA sandwich, and a PINEAPPLE RUM FLOAT as my alcoholic drink."
,,,,,"The pizza and sandwich was good. I liked how the bottom of the pizza was nice and crispy and both food items were hot too. My alcoholic drink wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The Pineapple Rum Float had no pineapple flavor, which was something I was looking forward to. It had more of a dark chocolate flavor with alcohol mixed into it."
,,,,,"I'd recommend this place! I'd advise you to know or ask around about what line each one is for since it was very confusing with the store's lack of signage. They also sell some cool souvenirs here too! Next time, I'll try one of their cocktails. I guess I'm not really a rum kind of girl."
,,,,,"I'm not too big a coffee drinker so I wasn't sure if the Starbucks Reserve Roastery was worth a trip for me, but it totally was!"
,,,,,Got the whiff of coffee as soon as I entered the place and it was just beautiful!
,,,,,The place had such a beautiful vibe on the inside as well.
,,,,,But now for the mean part... The food!
,,,,,The pastries and sandwiches and salad options which is amazing! It was so hard to pick what to go for.
,,,,,My boyfriend and I both got the Summer Squash Salad as well as the Caprese On Focaccia.
,,,,,He also got the limited time Custard Croissant/Cornetto for dessert.
,,,,,"The salad was just amazing! What perfectly roasted squash, a creamy yogurt topping and crunchy granola. The dressing was really good as well."
,,,,,I tried some of that yogurt just by itself and there was no tanginess at all like what you would usually expect. What a beautiful contraption here! I would totally have gone for a second.
,,,,,The salad came with a soft sourdough bun which was better than any Sourdough I have had in a while!
,,,,,My boyfriend had the same opinion of the salad. We both loved it!
,,,,,The caprese focaccia sandwich is just okay. Fresh mozzarella and bread as well. The bread did seem a little too oily and salty but it was okay. I asked for extra arugula on the side and they were happy to oblige.
,,,,,I tried some of the custard croissant and it was really fresh and soft as well. The bf definitely enjoyed this one!
,,,,,"let me tell ya something, the original starbucks in seattle is just a tourist trap! i think it's super cool but the line is always so long, id suggest skipping and checking out the starbucks reserve! The reserve is so entertaining and offers exclusive items that you won't find at other starbucks like affogatos, assorted sandwiches and pizza?!? what what! you heard me right! the back of the reserve has a pizza spot and it's bomb! seriously some of the best pizza i've had!! Id suggest the cheese because it comes fully loaded with sauce and cheese and it's cooked to perfection!"
,,,,,"I'm pleased to see I'm not the first person to ever Google ""do espresso martinis have caffeine in them"" because honestly, I had no idea. My friend was pretty certain they did, and I kept trying to tell him I think it's just an espresso flavored liquor. What do I know? I don't drink Martini's. I'm not a Martini girl. I'm a coffee girl, all day, everyday but I don't know the first thing about coffee cocktails. That all changed the afternoon we visited the Starbucks Reserve Roastery."
,,,,,"This place is really awesome. Perfect spot to hang out for a little bit, sure it's Starbucks but it's such a great energetic, bustling, good vibes spot."
,,,,,"I knew I'd be ordering the Starbucks Reserve Espresso Martini. After reviewing the menu, I now see the first ingredient listed is, Starbucks Reserve Espresso. My bestie probably already read this, and didn't have the heart to tell me - Candace! It's the first freaken ingredient for this drink. Bless his heart!"
,,,,,"This drink was super special! I don't think I'll ever order an espresso martini elsewhere, this was the perfect place for this cocktail. I'm more of a bourbon neat, or spicy marg type but I was so excited to try my first Espresso Martini and it did not disappoint. "
,,,,,"The space is gorgeous! The drinks, dare I say it... Fantastic, the food was yummy."
,,,,,"This is the type of place that you can easily visit each time you are in town, rather than a once and done."
,,,,,"I also loved their really large water bowls for four legged friends out front. I don't have a dog, but I love when I see businesses that are mindful of those who do, and are considerate of their hydration as well. Super sweet."
,,,,,"I'll definitely return in the future, seeing that this is the only spot I'll drink an Espresso Martini at. Ok, I'm done typing Espresso Martini. Promise."
,,,,,"Sunday morning. Busy place. Staff is walking on eggshells. Coffee is excellent, but the kitchen won't toast the sandwich. Manager gaslights me into his way or the highway by ascertaining that the sandwich WILL taste better if it is eaten with that bread chill in it. Satisfied that he handled a ""karen"" with perfect aplomb, he leaves no room for compromise. Cost of finding out where the rudeness begins: $40.00"
,,,,,"So I've visited the Reserve Roastery twice now.  My first visit was pre-covid and I was solo.  It was overwhelming for me - I didn't know where to order, there were so many people everywhere, and no seating available so I just did a walk-through and left.  On my visit this time around, there is a limited number of people allowed because of covid and I was with a friend.  There were tons of seats open (except for the bar area) and I could actually see where the lines began.  It was much more enjoyable the second time around."
,,,,,"My friend and I wanted to try their bar drinks that are coffee infused. Unfortunately you can't place an order until you have a table in the bar area.  There's only 6-8 tables available and no line or waitlist so you pretty much have to hover around and move in fast once a table opens up.  I didn't like this process at all, but we finally managed to snag a table."
,,,,,"My friend got the Espresso Martini Flight and I got the Final Say (matcha, tequila, other ingredients I can't remember).  I saw the bartender making my drink - I appreciate that he was grinding the matcha by hand and he put a lot of care into making it.  However, that drink was horrible and I seriously didn't want to finish it, but I learned in college to not waste alcohol lol.  And just for the record I did finish it haha.  The flight also wasn't my cup of tea either but I did like it more than the cocktail.  Next time I'll just stick with their non-alcoholic drinks haha."
,,,,,But we enjoyed the pastries a lot - the favorites being the Girella all'Uvetta e Pistachio (raisin snail) and the Raspberry Cornetti (raspberry croissant).  The Torta Nocciolina (hazelnut tart) was just alright.  A bit pricey but *all* of the food seriously looked too good to pass on.  I would want to go back to try more food items and enjoy the experience again.
,,,,,What an experience! 
,,,,,There's a line so plan accordingly but worth the wait! Super chill inside and everything you look at is photo ready. The food tastes as good as it looks. The alcohol bar was phenomenal. The roaster has special blends you can only get there. Very cool atmosphere
,,,,,"Amazing experience coming to Seattle and going to Starbucks Reserve for my first time! Coming to Seattle, I've always wanted to go but for some reason I never had the chance till this past week! I've been to Seattle 3x now but I am so glad I got to experience and eat here 2x while I was in Seattle this past week! Once on Saturday and the other time was Tuesday. I'd recommend going on a weekday as its less crowded. The moment you walk in they check your vaccine card (digital or real whichever is fine) and you walk in thinking this is not your typical coffee shop lol. I was amazed at all the machines and everything tbh. You walk in and you see the gift items in front then to the right is the food area and bar! OMG the food and the cocktails here are sooooo good! They have variety of pizzas, salads and pastries for you to try! They have a pretty large cocktail menu and I must say everything I ordered was delicious! "
,,,,,Cocktails: 
,,,,,-Sparking Sakura Allure: This one is a sparkly drink with a hint of Sakura flavors! It's a refreshing drink if you're in the mood for something bubbly! 
,,,,,"-Espresso Martini: I was blown away with this one honestly. It may have been my favorite out of the 2. I've never been into Martinis but this Espresso Martini was bomb dot com! I can't taste the alcohol tbh so I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing but it tasted amazing either way. The espresso is strong but super tasty! If it wasn't so late in the afternoon, I'd get another one lol. "
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,- Fungi pizza: This one was delicious! Usually I prefer pizza with meat but this one itself was flavorful and delicious! 
,,,,,"- Spinach, feta cheese and sausage pizza: This one was another flavorful one! You get a combination of sausage and veggies in one bite! The feta cheese has a strong taste so if you're not too into cheese that has strong taste then it might not be for you but I personally enjoyed it! "
,,,,,"- Pesto salad: Simple dish and it's super light. It has some tomatoes, cheese and olives in there. You can't go wrong ordering this on the side with your pizza! "
,,,,,- Tiramisu: BOMB! You can't go wrong with this and it went so well with the Espresso Martini. 
,,,,,- chocolate croissant: It's crispy on the outside and the sweet chocolate on the inside. This one too wasn't anything special but if you're craving sweets then tiramisu or croissant is the way to go. 
,,,,,"Overall, service was great and the drinks were bomb! I hope to come back to the Starbucks Reserve again soon!"
,,,,,Quite easily the fanciest coffeeshop I have ever been to... and it's a Starbucks too!
,,,,,"Don't expect this to be your typical Starbucks because it ain't. This is a Starbucks that sells delicious looking meals, alcohol, and coffee drinks you won't get at any usual Starbucks. Honestly, I feel the first OG Starbucks can't even match up to this one. Take pictures outside the OG Starbucks then come to this location about 0.7 miles away for drinks and food."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Omg really cool, must visit destination in Seattle! Got some type of whiskey-like brewed coffee. It was Smokey and EXTRAVAGANTLY prepared! Never tasted anything like it! Soooo good! Felt like a baller! Tried my friends' other drinks and they were delicious especially the pistachio latte. Gosh everything was good!"
,,,,,Comparing to the Chicago roastery this location was a letdown.
,,,,,"Separate line for food and drink, they were unable to heat up croissants and Other bakery items. The avocado toast was also served cold and hard. People were taking tables with no food and without ordering (pictured) and because of that once we received our food we went over to one of the long bars to eat and were quickly told we weren't allowed to even though they had nowhere else to eat and the man who took my order witnessed me go to sit down with my order number and the lady pictured just ran for the seat while the lady with her continued to walk around. Bad service, bad food, overpriced, do yourself a favor and skip a trip to this location there is many much better options in the area!"
,,,,,"Actually a beautiful space to take friends / visitors. It's touristy though for sure. Wouldn't wait in line, just try to catch it at an off hour (later in day). The space is well-designed and feels elegant, expansive, and futuristic. They have espresso martinis which are all the rage right now."
,,,,,Also nice bathrooms!
,,,,,"I walk by here all the time and see that it is absolutely full of people and foot traffic at pretty much all times, so I got curious and decided to try it with a friend. We went in at around 6PM and found it to be absolutely packed. It's a huge place reminiscent of a brewery, with tall ceilings and massive coffee equipment in the backdrop. On your right there is a bar which serves alcohol and on your left is the coffee bar. Throughout the store there is a ton of merch and high scale coffee equipment that can be purchased. "
,,,,,"I didn't try the alcohol bar and instead opted to go to the coffee area. A friendly lady greeted us and explained the menu and how it varied from the typical Starbucks -- this place doesn't have the normal menu or setup at all. I had plenty of time to go through the online menu while waiting in the wraparound line. After I ordered they pointed us to the pickup area and it didn't take too unusually long to get our order. As I mentioned the place was absolutely packed despite it being a snowy New Years Eve Eve, but because the place is so big we were able to find an open table for 2 to sit down relatively quick."
,,,,,"My drink was good, it seemed about the same as the normal equivalent at another Starbucks. The pastry however was much more fresh than you'd typically find laying around a SB window, so I was impressed there. Aside from that, it felt pretty touristy. Honestly, the whole place felt more like an attraction than a coffee shop. It definitely doesn't have any kind of intimate cafe vibe. It's much more similar to a brewery like I mentioned, and I definitely felt I had to speak up to be heard across the table to my friend. For those reasons the ambience was a little hard to pin down -- it doesn't feel like a cafe nor a bar nor a brewery but something in between, which could be good or bad depending on what you like."
,,,,,"Overall it's a cool place, impressively large and the quality is good. If you're a Starbucks nerd you'd probably love it. For me, it was cool but we'll see if I find myself wanting to stop here and going through all the commotion every time I want a quick drink."
,,,,,"Absolutely LOVED their famous Whiskey barrel aged cold brew coffee!  It had the perfect amount of sweetness and it was very smooth. They also serve it to you in a whiskey glass and the huge signature ice cube. Whatever halo select, you can't go wrong tasting a flight trio here as I did from the cold brews to the martini trios. However, if you want something Original that that this Starbucks Reserve carries and is famous for then do yourself a favor and order the Whiskey Barrel aged cold brew coffee."
,,,,,They have tons of souvenirs among coffee items for you to purchase and a  bar on the side where you can also order alcoholic beverages. Apparently before COVID they had walking tours where they would explain the roasting bean process but for now you can just watch the whole process at a distance and immerse yourself in how fast paced this place is. 
,,,,,Baristas were great! Cashier had originally got my order wrong but the baristas were more than accommodating in making sure I was still happy with my drinks and had a great experience. A must stop for all the coffee junkies and Starbucks fanatics. I'll definitely be back again!
,,,,,I've wanted to go here for decades and never been to Seattle. So stop #1 was here first thing in the morning!! I was so overwhelmed with the options. Their pastries were European quality. I went for the cold brew flight with sea salt chocolate. My husband got the espresso flight and we got the Irish coffee w/ barrel aged whiskey coffee. 
,,,,,Btw that coffee is $40 a small bag. I did find a neat cup to take home. I was thrilled. 
,,,,,Their restrooms are unisex. They have plenty of seating.
,,,,,"If you're a fan of Willy Wonka like I am, then Starbucks Reserve is bound to give you that warm fuzzy feeling. A mid-day visit was perfect for a gloomy day and a quick pick-me-up."
,,,,,"The great thing about this location, there's a bar if you'd like to mix alcohol and coffee for a twist to happy hour. I also like how there are different ordering areas for the bar, the bakery, coffee and to grab gifts from their shop right in the center of all. "
,,,,,"Keep in mind, the drinks are little pricier here (for two coffee drinks it was $18) but the flow of everything and all the cool machinery makes it worth the visit. Also, if there's a long line at the Original Starbucks at Pike Place Market, this is an excellent alternative. "
,,,,,I tried a Cold Brew Malt (coffee with ice cream - seriously what's better?). It was smooth and savory to the last drop. I seriously only want a Cold Brew Malt every morning - unfortunately I don't think the drink would last through shipping (insert sad face). 
,,,,,"Seriously, go check it out!! You'll enjoy it, I promise!"
,,,,,Thoroughly impressed!
,,,,,"I have had so many great cups of espresso and coffee throughout Europe and the Middle East.  From Ristretto, to Espresso, to Turkish Coffee, I really enjoy coffee.  However, I am not a coffee snob and will often have at least 75% of the time, a decaf coffee since living in the desert dryness, decaf is a form of hydration and frankly the taste is fine for me.  Office decaf is often a brand I am not focused on and will simply use it and it is fine.  Going to a normal Starbucks is fine for me, I mostly get the Pikes coffee black. Going to the small unique privately owned coffee shops, I generally will order a black coffee."
,,,,,"So, when the family suggested going to the Starbucks Reserve, I was thinking, okay, but what is going to be special when I just drink decaf or black coffee..."
,,,,,"We got here just before 8:00 am on Sunday on a Labor Day holiday weekend.  We found parking at the garage across the street and also there was no line, other than the one at the cashier / ordering area.  Normally, we heard that there are lines going around the entire building, so we decided to come early and skip the line."
,,,,,"1.  Espresso - So, they had a wonderful menu and I ordered the flight of espresso.  They served me two espressos from beans called Costa Rica Naranjo and Vietnam Da Lat.  Beautifully presented, comes with water, I loved the entire ambiance and style.  But, I have to give this a 2 out of 5 star.  Why, the espresso was luke warm to me and when espresso is luke warm, I have a hard time to taste the espresso.  This was a fail, but they get 2 stars for presentation.  Okay, I can be a bit superficial..."
,,,,,"2. WBA Cold Brew - Everyone in our family wanted to try this. I am thinking...WHAT?  I cannot and do not like lukewarm espresso, why would I want a cold brew? I have had a cold brew before and was simply not impressed at all.  Also, what does Whiskey Barrel Aged mean???  Well, my daughter ordered one and since you are noticing that I was in a superficial mood at this place, I was immediately impressed with the brew being served in a whiskey glass with a large square whiskey ice cube.  I love having bourbon over the big sphere or square ice cubes, so I was immediately interested.  They give you a separate glass jar with the WBA Cold Brew to pour over the ice.  I did try this.  This was a 7 out of 5 stars!  far exceeded any of my expectations."
,,,,,"Smooth, velvety and complex. The flavor of the WBA is so very special and unique. While this is coffee, it has absorbed the flavor or Whiskey, and this is an experience that just blows up your taste buds.  There is no alcohol and if you do not like the taste of Whiskey or Bourbon, that is okay, as the flavor that this imparts to the coffee beans is subtle and if you like ice cream, cake, chocolate or anything sweet, you will like this taste."
,,,,,Now I am on a mission to go to a Starbucks Reserve whenever I can and when traveling (in the future).
,,,,,GK says... check it out!
,,,,,Starbucks Reserve Roastery was definitely above any Starbucks joint that we have been to. 
,,,,,"Their pastries are definitely a notch above any Starbucks location. They are baked fresh before you, and visually look more appealing. We had an almond croissant (cornetta as they call it), which was crispy, buttery, and very nice to have on a cold winter day. "
,,,,,"As for drinks, we had the espresso martini flight. Each of the three mixed Martinis were satisfactory to drink overall, and interesting to experience the three different unique flavors (molé spice, cherry limone, orange cacao). We liked molé spice and cherry limone the most, but the nice foam of all three particularly were enjoyable the most. "
,,,,,"However, at the end of the day, we did not find anything ""wow"" or particularly outstanding by the croissant or drinks that we had. The atmosphere was warm and pleasant, and so we give this place a solid three."
,,,,,Busy and expensive. It's still worth coming here because of the great experience that you get. Parking is terrible here. We got a latte and the whiskey cold brew. Incredible smoothness and coffee flavor mixed with whiskey. A little bit sweet for my taste but still very good. They have tons of seating available. Great food and even an Italian pizza/bread kitchen where you can pick up something heavier. Drinks come out quick as they call out your name. A definite visit if you are in Seattle to visit!

,,,,,"If you are a Starbucks fan, you owe yourself the opportunity to see the Reserve Roastery when in Seattle. Only about a mile from Pike Place Market, this venue is pure magic. First off the venue is amazing with open ceilings and amazing two story architecture. The venue is divided into 3 sections. The coffee, the cocktails, and the food. Don't worry as all of the lines go fast and you can order from multiple areas and then sit at convenient tables or chairs throughout the roastery. "
,,,,,"One thing to note is that there are several coffees that are not served anywhere else, so if you want to try something unique, this is the place. And if you want to try a Starbucks hand crafted cocktail, they got you covered. We sampled the Espresso Martini flight and it was nothing short of amazing. In addition, they have a nice gift shop area with Reserve logo stuff. Super high quality and friendly and efficient staff makes this experience 5 star"
,,,,,"Went on a Monday during brunch time and found a table fairly quickly. Be warned the location is up some rather steep hills depending on where you're coming from (if walking), but worth it! Lots of aesthetic merchandise if you're a Starbucks fan. They surprisingly didn't have any of the ""Been There"" merchandise, however. "
,,,,,"Lots of unique drinks that can't be found at regular Starbucks locations. As someone who doesn't typically drink coffee, I found the Cold Brew Float to be perfect due to the sweetness from the ice cream! My friends also enjoyed their drinks."
,,,,,"The food was nothing incredibly special, but not bad."
,,,,,I've been to Seattle a million times and even lived there for a couple of years and I had never gone here until recently. Big mistake! I missed out on so many angelic drinks. We went here a week ago and there was a Tsunami warning on our phones from that Tonga volcano and luckily the walk up to this roastery was to higher elevation. There was no tsunami but if there ever is just come here lol. 
,,,,,"I had an Oatmilk Honey Latte and one of their breakfast sandwiches where the name cannot be pronounced or remembered. Every bite, every sip was just incredible. The problem was I did not know that there was another level with alcoholic Starbucks! Dropped the ball on that one, but I was able to taste my friend's whiskey barrel cold brew and to my surprise it did not even need creamer and I am a creamer junkie. This place tastes nothing like the other Starbucks and do not miss it if you go to Seattle."
,,,,,"I had been wanting to pop in to a Starbucks Reserve for a while now! It was quite busy on a Sunday evening, and we did have to stand and wait for a table to open up. While we waited, we walked around, saw the art work, merchandise, and the food. This is not a typical Starbucks! This was my first espresso martini, and I think it was quite good! I think this is a good spot take take friends in town who like coffee. The atmosphere is fun (not bar/club fun, but more energy than sitting in a coffee shop)"
,,,,,"If you're a huge fan of Starbucks, this touristy place is definitely a must-go! This multi-level coffee shop offers a bar with coffee-infused cocktails, pastries, coffee beans, and merch! We got the Espresso Flight, which is a great sampler of different flavors: citrus, chocolate, and spicy. This was a must-try! If you're a tea lover, the Maharaja Chai Nog was so delicious. The rum and chai, along with the almond milk all complimented each other nicely. Not to mention, it was super aesthetic for pictures! We also got the board with a selection of cheese, ham, along with bread. Perfect pairing with your drink! We then finished the night off with a chocolate hazelnut cornetto, which was so decadent!! You will definitely be able to spend hours in this place trying out their numerous selections and gift shopping!"
,,,,,"This is probably my favorite spot to hangout in the city. They've got princi bakery goods which are delicious, and a nice assortment of reserve coffees. If you compare the coffee to other local roasters it's obviously not going to win out, but the overall vibe here is perfect for hanging out later into the night. I loved coming by in the evening, grabbing a latte and a pastry, and settling in to either do some work or get through a good book. Always worth a visit!"
,,,,,"I love visiting starbucks reserve roastery, to check out the interior design and interesting coffee tools. This Seattle Reserve is not the biggest I've been, but it has a very cute sitting area and staircase. They have a variety of choices, which took me a long time to decide what to get. Eventually we got the espresso flight. Cool experience."
,,,,,"Great place to get your Java on.  Super friendly staff. Coffees were delicious and so were the desserts. They were roasting beans while we were here and it was interesting to watch the process. Street parking available if you find a spot, or there's parking garages around the area."
,,,,,"We visited this location on a Sunday morning around 10am. Not sure about parking since we walked here from our hotel, but it appeared pretty limited. "
,,,,,"It was pretty busy, but the line was not out the door and onto the sidewalk as I have seen in the past. We walked right in.  There was someone at the entrance checking vaccination cards. "
,,,,,"The inside is large with lots to look at including merch, a bakery, and full bar!  Seating was pretty limited, but we were able to find a spot to enjoy our drinks."
,,,,,"I ordered the whiskey barrel-aged cold brew.  I am not a coffee drinker, but my drink was delicious!  It did not convert me to a coffee drinker, but I would definitely get it again."
,,,,,"I really should have written this immediately because I forgot the barista's name, but he is a tell gentleman that wears glasses. He really was entertaining, informative, and insightful. "
,,,,,"I tried a flight of cold brews, and without a doubt it was the best I ever had times 4. The flavors were inspired and delicious."
,,,,,"I'm telling anyone who likes coffee, forget the tourist trap feeling at Pike's Market, and go the the Reserve Roastery for the EXPERIENCE! "
,,,,,"Don't forget to tip your barista! It's not in the cost, and they don't give you that option when they charge it initially. It might be an option if you order food."
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I wanted a Starbucks experience in Seattle, but the line at Pike Place Market was too long. I decided to go to this location, which seemed like the better option based on my preferences. Since I used to go the Starbucks Reserve when there was the Los Angeles location on La Brea, I was familiar with Reserve Bar menu as I used to order the Dark Chocolate Mocha and Cold Brew Float."
,,,,,"I wanted try something new so I ordered the Espresso Dolce (5 stars) with passion fruit pomegranate. I enjoyed the unique combination of espresso, fruit puree, and sweet cream. It plays with all your taste buds with sweetness from the cream and fruit puree. The puree was also slightly tart that cuts through the richness of the drink. It still had the bold espresso flavor that complemented the other strong flavors. It gave me a caffeine kick, but my husband did not like it. He preferred his Cold Brew (4 stars) with a splash of sweet cream."
,,,,,"If I stayed in Seattle longer, then I would have tried one of their cocktails. It is also a roastery so you can watch the process in the works, which was cool to see as we were waiting for our drinks. Service was 5 stars."
,,,,,"This is the first time I sat on the bar side, I didn't know they serve cocktails too. My friend got A flight, which the main ingredient is coffee and turn into yummy cocktails. I got a SPARKLING SAKURA ALLURE. It tasted like tea and juice!! "
,,,,,Overall it's a great experience and it's a good place to take cute pictures
,,,,,We usually come to the Roastery if we have guests in town or are in town and wanna have a seat. It's chill. There's a lot to see that's Starbucks and it's great for people watching. 
,,,,,NOTE: you might not find your favorite Starbucks drink here. This is a specialty store and their showing off their coffee. 
,,,,,"Go during the day to watch actual production of beans - roasting and bagging. You will also find a restaurant, an alcohol bar, a gift shop, a coffee bean bulk purchase bar, some fresh bakery items, and their drink ordering area to-go or stay. "
,,,,,If you've never been - go! If you have guests - take them! Starbucks is definitely trying to reinvent their local status in Seattle (though Roasteries have opened in NYC and Chicago too).
,,,,,"I am a bucks girl. It's my daily go to.  Starbucks has been a constant in my life, and Ive watched the changes and growing pains over the years. "
,,,,,"Discovering Starbucks reserve Roastery in Seattle, was like walking into Nirvana."
,,,,,"I don't even know where to begin because the experience was overwhelmingly delicious, surprisingly above and beyond anything that I imagined, and I wish that I lived closer."
,,,,,"The roastery features amazing European made in the house pastries, food offerings, that include divine sandwiches, delicious flatbread pizzas, and just so much more. Order the cannoli. It's out of this world scrumptious."
,,,,,The roastery features made in house at their bar adult libations that will knock your socks off.  The bartender knows his stuff!
,,,,,"If you're looking for the traditional Starbucks caffeinated beverages, this is so much more than that. Dessert coffee beverages, to pure roasted coffee, teas, and drinks that sadly are not made at the basic Starbucks stores."
,,,,,"The Rosetree also features unique Starbucks coffee cups, water bottles, French presses, and other items that are only unique to their location."
,,,,,"Everything about the space in place is unique and wonderful, and I truly wish that the basic Starbucks stores would up their game. I get that it would take away from the three roastery's in the country, but it's just that everything is so amazing, that I would want to experience it more often."
,,,,,"Seattle, Chicago, and New York are the only three locations in the country that feature a full on roastery. Yes, you can go in and watch them roast the beans from start to finish, enjoy adult libations, European cuisine, and some of the best damn coffee out there. Make a point of visiting one. You won't regret it."
,,,,,One of my favorite experiences during my first trip to Seattle! 
,,,,,Of course everyone told me to visit the first Starbucks in Pike Place but the Starbucks Reserve was also highly recommended and I'm so glad I listened! 
,,,,,"The space is huge with 3 different ""bars"" that offer yummy drinks, pastries, lunches, etc. "
,,,,,"My husband had their hazelnut latte (not what it's called but that's the flavor lol), I had their espresso martini flight and we shared a slice of their raspberry cheesecake. Everything was delicious! I loved the aesthetic of the martini flight and it was very different from any other Starbucks - obviously. There was actual liquor inside the espresso martinis and I felt pretty great after the flight. Hahahah, I will have to say that the mole one was not my favorite. :( "
,,,,,"The space is an influencer's (or in my case, wanna-be influencer lol) dream. There is so much to see and a great place for a photo-op. "
,,,,,"All the baked goods looked incredible. I wish I had a bigger appetite or more time to enjoy & indulged! They had pizzas available, which would have been so nice for lunch. "
,,,,,I highly recommend for anyone visiting Seattle! I can't wait to go back again.
,,,,,This place is awesome.  Been to Seattle several times and never knew about this location.  It's like the Graceland of Starbucks.  The wife and I absolutely loved the Starbucks based cocktails that they served here.  We even made it a point to visit this location again right before our flight home.  Got one for the road!
,,,,,"The Starbucks Reserve is busy as when your local Starbucks releases their fall/winter drinks, but instead of being busy just a couple of days. It's busy all the time. I'm glad I stopped by the Reserve in Seattle. As much as I wanted to grab a coffee, I thought why not just opt in for their Espresso Martini."
,,,,,"They have some amazing team members to guide you right when you walk in. When you order at the bar, you do have to have a table ahead of time. You cannot simply order and walk around with your alcoholic drink. During peak hours, it can become difficult to snatch a table. I also ordered a pizza at another location within the Roastery. It got the job done and filled me up!!"
,,,,,It's a nice one time experience. I don't think I would visit another one unless I'm outside the country.
,,,,,"Such a cool spot, a must-go if you're visiting the Seattle area! It has tons of merch, food, coffee drinks, alcoholic drinks, and tons of seating. We got the funghi pizza and espresso martini, which were both great. It was bit hard to find seating on a Saturday night, apart from the bar seating. "
,,,,,"For those who drink alcohol, definitely head to the bar when you visit! The Roastery offers a selection of unique coffee- and tea-based drinks."
,,,,,Wow! Just wow! I fell in love with this place maybe because it's my first time going into a Starbucks Reserve and trying out some of their exclusive items on their menu. 
,,,,,"My family and I was in Seattle for Veterans Day weekend and since we didn't have much planned out, we decided to make this place one of our stops. Let me just say that it's a good thing I went on Yelp to just get some insight on the place and what to expect since it's not a ""regular"" Starbucks shop. A fellow Yelper mentioned  showing your COVID vaccination card or a 72-hour negative test result and I'm glad I saw that because it is require when going into restaurants to dine in. "
,,,,,"There's street parking around the area or there's a parking lot across the street where Salvation Army is at and parking was about $10 if I'm not mistaken. We walked in and it was busy, which we expected. The line was pretty long, but moving pretty quickly. If you're going in as a big group, have one or two people in your group look for a table otherwise your items will be packed to go. "
,,,,,"I tried the Irish con crema and it was pretty strong for me, but definitely tasty. My daughter got the vanilla cream (I think that's what it's called) with their house hazelnut milk. I would recommend that if you want something hot to drink especially in Seattle's rainy weather but don't want any caffeine. "
,,,,,"For food, my husband and I both got the salmon cream cheese brioche sandwich and my daughter got the prosciutto and cheese brioche sandwich. Pretty pricey, but the food and drinks were definitely worth it! "
,,,,,Can't wait to visit Seattle again and try out other items from the Starbucks Reserve menu.
,,,,,HEADS UP: Current local regulation requires you to show proof of vaccination OR a negative Covid test in the past 72 hours for entrance/dine in. 
,,,,,"As much as I try to avoid the everyday Starbucks stop when I'm at home, I can't help but gravitate towards the reserve every time I'm in Seattle. Vibe check? Passed. "
,,,,,"This place feels like my version of coffee heaven. The style and design of the reserve is incredible- modern, industrial, open, and light. The food is delicious! The drinks are great. There's even some light shopping you can do. I'm really not ashamed to confess my love for the Starbucks Reserve Roastery. "
,,,,,"There are 3 sections to order from: 1) the food side where you can order pizzas, soups, pastries, and sandwiches 2) the drinks side where you can grab their signature coffee drinks as well as some pastries and sandwiches 3) the bar side where you can order alcohol drinks. "
,,,,,"I LOVE THE FOOD HERE. my husband and I are convinced this is one of our favorite pizza places! Odd, it's a Starbucks. But there's something about that Princi pizza on focaccia dough. There's something special about the salmon croissant sandwich. There's extravagance in their layers and layers of croissant flakes. The coffee is above and beyond your regular chain location. We order the cold brew float everytime. It's amazing. "
,,,,,"All in all, if you're in Seattle...this is the spot you CANNOT miss. It may feel overhyped but it's 100% worth it. Yes, it can be crowded during peak hours. But come early morning or late afternoon and you'll see what this place is about!"
,,,,,1124 Pike St
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"OK, this is just Starbucks showing off, but what a job they do of it! "
,,,,,"It would be easy to accuse this corporate coffee giant of pandering to their fanbase with this remarkable, impressive showroom, and I'm sure there are plenty of cynics that could/would make a case for it. But as someone who rarely, if ever, drinks coffee in any form, the Reserve Roastery is still pretty badass; you don't have to be a coffee enthusiast to enjoy your time here. And to top it all off, it is an actual, working roastery, so you get the best aesthetics of form and function, along with some excellent food, experimental drinks, and a heaping dose of the Cult of Starbucks, all in one place."
,,,,,"For first-timers, things can be a bit overwhelming here. Seating can be tough to secure, so you *must* be vigilant, and a bit cutthroat; try to find somewhere to sit first, before exploring. Once that's out of the way, there are several zones within where you can order snacks and beverages, based on your preference. There's a bar and bakery sharing the back right corner (""Arriviamo"" and ""Princi"", respectively), serving remarkably tasty pizzas baked in-house, as well as coffee/espresso infused cocktails (espresso martini flight, anyone?), as well as a few old stand-bys. "
,,,,,"A spacious merch area buffers the bar from the central counter, where most of the action happens. Here, you'll find tasty pastries, succulent sandwiches, and a bevy of beverages you won't find at any other terrestrial Starbucks location. Does the Reserve Roastery function as a test kitchen, previewing items before they make their debut at a Starbucks near you? If not, they should, because there are some fantastic selections here that ought to be shared with the wider world, although it's easy to see how some of them might be logistically challenging."
,,,,,"In the lower section, the focus seems to dial in on espresso and espresso-related experiences. Here, you can sample a tasting flight of various espresso shots, enjoy an affogato, and watch as the various roasting and sorting machines perform their magic: sifting, sorting and carrying off batches of freshly roasted beans through a series of transparent pipes to God knows where, before the end up brewed in your next cuppa. It's an entertaining experience to watch, here in the heart of the beast, and regularly draws a crowd of onlookers, cameras at the ready."
,,,,,"Starbucks Reserve Roastery is not likely to be anyone's regular café; it's too busy, it's more expensive than usual, and I'm sure the novelty would wear off overtime. As an experience, though, particularly for coffee aficionados, it's unbeatable, but also enjoyable for even the most casual coffee connoisseur, such as myself. There's sure to be something for everyone to enjoy, even if it's just taking in the atmosphere, the wonderful aromas and, if you really just hate coffee, grab a cocktail and hang out for a bit. For some, the Reserve Roastery, like the 1st and Pike location, will be a pilgrimage. For others, it's still a top tier café, on all fronts. You can leave your own reservations outside the Reserve, as they are not needed (for a table, or otherwise)!"
,,,,,This place has unique drinks that you cannot get anywhere else. It also has bakery and food items as well as alcoholic items that you cannot get it any other Starbucks. This makes it worth the trip plus you can see all the beans being roasted. I got a cold brew milkshake and olive bread stick which was really good. My friend got the avocado toast which was just OK a lot of their other food items looked pretty good but long wait when you go on a Saturday. The coffee line actually move pretty fast for as many people that were there. This is an experience I think everyone should do at least once.
,,,,,"Parking: street parking or find a parking garage. It's pretty difficult to find, but we lucked out with street parking "
,,,,,The store
,,,,,-bring your covax card to go inside 
,,,,,"-once you get inside there's lot of merchandise to purchase and there's two separate areas to order. This proved confusing for us. When we first walked in we weren't sure which line to go in, but we assumed (incorrectly) that they would be the same. When we got the front of the line we found out that the line we were in only had some of the food items but that we were supposed to go the other line for the hot food items. There were no signs or anything, so that was frustrating to have wasted our time. We ended up just getting cold food in this line since we didn't want to wait in another line (NOTE: I noticed on the way out that they had people stationed at the front to direct and answer question - they were not there when we arrived so that may have helped). We got the smoked salmon and cream cheese sandwich and a chocolate tarte (both were decent. I liked the chocolate tarte best). For drinks we got the cold brew float (I actually really liked this) and the mole mocha (me and my husband both didn't like it unfortunately, we ended up tossing it. It was just like an extremely bitter chocolate milk). "
,,,,,"After exploring we found another small section at the back with a bar but again, not a lot of signs so I'm not sure if that was a different station where you can order different things or just the same as the front. There's a decent amount of seating but for the crowds of tourists you need to be aggressive to get a seat. "
,,,,,They do have bathrooms. They are a gender neutral bathroom with plenty of stalls and a family stall. 
,,,,,"Overall, I was super excited to try this place but left a bit disappointed. I'll try to visit again and try something different and update my review!"
,,,,,The takeaway: 
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle and at all interested in coffee, take the chance to check this place out, if only for the novelty. "
,,,,,---
,,,,,Full review: 
,,,,,"Busy, packed, tourist trap, but in a nice way! "
,,,,,"This is a Starbucks flagship store/showroom, and it shows. The drinks selection was massive, with lots of Reserve-only choices that show off a more ""refined"" side to what Starbucks has to offer. "
,,,,,Drinks:
,,,,,"The drinks of course were A+. I had the cold brew trio, which included the standard cold brew and nitro cold brew you can get at a regular Starbucks Reserve, and a special Whiskey-Barrel Aged cold brew, which apparently they only have here? Has all the roasty oaky notes of a whiskey, without the uh, whiskey. The Whiskey-Barrel Aged cold brew comes lightly sweeted, without any sort of cream, and is absolutely delicious. "
,,,,,Food: 
,,,,,"Lots of great bakery and food choices, from small desserts and warm sandwiches, to a full on hot-food area with pizzas and more. Absolutely try the ""princina"", a dense chocolate brownie-tart thing - really more of a flourless chocolate cake in a crust. Maybe bring a buddy, it's delicious but dense. "
,,,,,"I didn't try the hot-food section, but it sure smelled great from the bar. Speaking of..."
,,,,,Bar:
,,,,,"The bar is an experience. Sitting at a bar in a Starbucks is a novelty in and of itself. But the bar was well run and had lots of interesting cocktails that highlighted coffees and teas. The espresso martini flight is the star of the show here - three espresso martinis flavored with different liquers and accompanying mixes (orange cacao, mole spice, cherry lemon). I must have seen 30-50 of these flights being made during the hourish that I spent here. "
,,,,,"Definitely try the Whiskey Cloud and the Sakura Allure (green tea, prosecco, whiskey, vanilla, lemon - slightly strange but delicious and refreshing). "
,,,,,"Bartenders Matt and Jonathan are super friendly - they answered questions, kept up the banter, and were all around great folks to hang out with, all while they churned out dozens of drinks every couple minutes. Huge shoutout to them."
,,,,,"Although it's touristy, the Starbucks Reserve is SO cool and a must see if you're visiting Seattle. It's like the Disneyland of Starbucks. The place is huge with tons to see, eat, and drink. The experience is very interactive and immersive. "
,,,,,I got an espresso martini at the bar. It was delicious and strong with rich coffee flavor.
,,,,,"This place has such a chill true Seattle vibe. The woods, exposed pipes, roaster, tanks, coffee house/ cool bar, gift shop and of course the food! I could sit here and people watch all day."
,,,,,"From the moment you walk in you can smell the blended roasts and fresh, hot coffee and pastries both savory and sweet in the air. Um... need this in an air freshener to capture this. "
,,,,,"I did an affogato flight and it did not disappoint. They have several options but I love ice cream anything and paired with smooth coffee, it's just soo good. The baristas are so knowledgeable and friendly while making your order. It's not really sharable but I would say if your a couple wanting to try a few things off the menu then order 1 flight of each. "
,,,,,"Just dreaming about going back and if you're ever in Seattle, skip the original location and check the reserves out instead. You won't regret it. Enjoy."
,,,,,"Yes, it's touristy. But it's definitely a touristy spot that is worth going for any coffee enthusiast. Finding street parking was miserable. But when you get past that hurdle, you're in the clear. "
,,,,,"When you first get in, it can definitely feel overwhelming with the numerous lines and Starbucks swag everywhere. But it was well staffed and someone was usually available to answer any of the stupid questions I might have and."
,,,,,My recommendation is definitely the whiskey aged cold brew if you want to try something not offered at normal Starbucks. The whiskey flavor is not hidden at all in the cold brew. You get this smooth and sweet flavor that goes really nice in a cold brew. 
,,,,,"They offer ""real"" food here too such as pizzas and smoke salmon sandwiches if you're craving a bite."
,,,,,Definitely worth stopping if you're in the area. I had a pleasant experience here on my visit to Seattle.
,,,,,This is the first of 6 Starbucks Reserve Roastery locations! It's definitely a must visit as well as the first Starbucks store which is only almost a mile away! 
,,,,,My first visit here pre-Covid was on a weekday so there was no wait and many open seats. 
,,,,,My latest visit post-Covid was on a rainy December weekend which meant long but doable lines and hardly any open seats available (we ended up standing alongside a table by the window). 
,,,,,"You can pay using your Starbucks app for beverages, Starbucks food and merch to earn rewards, but I believe you cannot redeem rewards here. There is a bar and another food area inside to the right of the entrance but I'm unsure if you can also pay with the Starbucks app."
,,,,,"I honestly didn't think the exclusive merchandise was thaaat cool, but that's just me. If you're looking for a Seattle mug souvenir, I'd suggest getting one from the first Starbucks shop. "
,,,,,The menu is different than a regular Starbucks menu!  
,,,,,"We ordered the pistachio latte & hazelnut bianco latte! The drinks are pretty darn good and I'd recommend! We also ordered almond croissants and they were so warm, fluffy and fresh! "
,,,,,The staff we encountered were all friendly and helpful with our choices. You can tell they really know what they're talking about with their menu! 
,,,,,There are unisex restrooms inside. The mirror doubles as a window which views some of their coffee making process. 
,,,,,Proof of vaccination required prior to entering.
,,,,,"I'm not gonna lie, when I walked it I didn't even know where to start! With all the merch everywhere, machinery straight ahead, coffee on the left, bar and food on the right."
,,,,,"Let me tell you, I started at the bar lol. I got the espresso martini flight. After the first sip I took, I was impressed. The first one I tried was the orange cacao, and it was my favorite of the three. There was a smooth orange flavor throughout this drink."
,,,,,I didn't know what to expect from the lemon. I but I was pleasantly surprised. The lemon flavor was kind of a lemon candy kind of flavor and there was a nice blend of flavors in the drink. 
,,,,,The classic was my boyfriends favorite. It tasted like espresso without being bitter or too strong. 
,,,,,"The princina was so rich! A cookie crust with a very thick gooey chocolate center. I could easily see how it could be a bit much for some people. Personally I thought it was amazing. The tiramisu was also good, but be careful not to inhale the cocoa powder on top. Lmfao- speaking from experience."
,,,,,"Everything we ordered was good. My friend insisted we try the food here, especially lasagna. The lasagna was the excellent. It didn't really have sauce, but it was cheesy and had so much flavor. The noodles were thick and it had a lot of layers. I still think about that lasagna lol. The pizza we had was also good, but I couldn't eat much of it after having everything else. I will say that they pile on the toppings, they are cheesy and there is no lacking in flavor. All items we ordered were fresh and served hot. "
,,,,,I'd also like to note that I encountered a few different workers and they were all nice and helpful. Great staff. 
,,,,,"Seating can be an issue, but there are areas to sit next to the coffee bar and down the stairs at the end of the coffee bar. There's also a standing are with a counter. If you're with people I suggest one person order and someone else look for seating."
,,,,,My favorite spot for that classic Starbucks coffee- this is the whole experience of Starbucks with an Italian twist. Staff is overall very friendly but seating can be hard to find!
,,,,,"All of the food, which is what makes the Roastery a 12/10, is from Milanese bakery Princi. You'll find a wide variety of pastries, breads, and cakes as well as meal options for breakfast and lunch. The focaccia pizza is one of my absolute top items here! Lived in Milan for a while and Princi baked goods bring me hardcore nostalgia; it's authentic, rustic, and delicious."
,,,,,"I also enjoy that you are able to choose from several coffee experiences (flights, tastings, lattes, etc.) so you can enjoy brews not offered at regular store locations (even the OG Pike Place one!)."
,,,,,Did I mention they have a BAR?! Awesome craft cocktails and an espresso martini flight as well :) They have an excellent French 75 and their prosecco by the glass never fails me.
,,,,,"I like to bring my kindle and post up- I know that no matter what I'm in the mood for, they've got me covered. Sometimes I go not being fully sure what I want yet, but I never leave disappointed!"

,,,,,"miliar with this area. It was difficult to find. Hint it's upstairs. The staff here is very friendly. The coffee is good just not what I'm used to drinking. If you are a first timer you get a free mug with an email sign up. The view is nice and atmosphere is super comfy. There is a fire place and seating area. To be honest I love my coffee bitter, but sweet. So I love to brew my at home. Nothing compares to the coffee I make at home."
,,,,,"Was craving a cortado & found this wonderful coffee shop near Pikes Market. It was a bit of a challenge to find, it's on the top level of the building. Walking in the ambience was fantastic! Lots of cozy places to sit & relax! The service was friendly & social distancing protocols were followed. I will make this a regular stop anytime I'm in the area!!"
,,,,,OMG! One of my top coffee spots in Seattle. I have to say while vacationing in Seattle we tried a few coffee spots even the famous Starbucks that everyone goes to. And by far one of my fave spots was this coffee shop!
,,,,,The baristas here were super friendly and gave great suggestions on what to try! I had an Expresso with a chocolate croissant. It was delicious! This coffee bar was cozy and a great place to start our morning. 
,,,,,Also if you sign up with your email they give you a free mug which is cool! Would stop by again if I'm ever in town again! Great spot!!
,,,,,"Known for their latte and if you are a new customer, register for their email list as instructed in their store to get a free mug. I wouldn't say they have the best coffee but it's pretty good and the overall experience for me worth the 5 stars rating."
,,,,,Wife & I each had a hot latte first day in town. 
,,,,,"They had whole milk, 2 shots of espresso and a little vanilla syrup. Both were Excellent! Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,Go here if you want to get Seattle's most expensive burnt coffee. 8oz Cappuccino was $7.7 before tip. The coffee was flat and burnt. Honestly don't know what's the hype about.
,,,,,"Visiting Seattle and I've been trying a few coffee shops along the way. Stopped by this shop at Pikes Place, it was super super busy and crowded probably because it's very touristy and a holiday weekend. But I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff with all of the chaos going on that I felt like actually writing this review. I didn't feel rushed and they were very kind and gave us a free mug. The coffee was great also!"
,,,,,"The best coffee I had throughout my whole Seattle trip; they definitely raised the bar!!! I got the iced vanilla latte, as recommended by the barista, and I was not disappointed. Usually I avoid vanilla lattes because they tend to be too sweet, but this one was perfectly balanced with vanilla and espresso. I would definitely forgo back during my next Seattle trip!"
,,,,,"Decided to try out a different coffee place when visiting Seattle as a fun date day, since both my partner and I are baristas and coffee fanatics! The entrance was a bit hard to find, but once found I was in awe at the completely calm atmosphere. "
,,,,,"As soon as we walked in, the baristas greeted us and were so lovely to talk to. I just HAD to sign up to get a free complimentary mug! :)"
,,,,,"The coffee itself is super smooth. We tried an iced dirty chai and a cold brew. The cold brew really gives you a knock in the teeth with popping flavor, and their chai is ultimately delicious. "
,,,,,"For two large drinks, it was a bit pricey. However, its coffee in Seattle. I love this place!"
,,,,,Storyville Coffee was as good as i remembered last year. The latte was very evident but light. It wasn't too milky but the coffee wasn't overly bitter either.
,,,,,"The Cinnamon Roll was also as soft, and melted-sugar-crusted as I remembered."
,,,,,Hot chocolate is better tuan some coffee places I've been to.
,,,,,Storyville Coffee Company coffee is so good that we went back twice more during our stay here.
,,,,,Storyville is located on the second floor of the Sanitary Market and a great location choice it is! Why?
,,,,,"- Here, they were able to occupy a larger space therefore they are able install seating areas with large comfy leather couches, coffee tables, bars and stools and a right cozy fireplace."
,,,,,- One wall is made up completely of windows and overlooks Pike Place (the road) and you get a great view of the iconic sign.
,,,,,"- The space is beautiful, comfortable and spacious enough for larger groups and study/work sessions."
,,,,,We ordered coffee and mocha and they were strong but not bitter.
,,,,,We also ordered tea and hot chocolates and they were also both very good. They melt the chocolate on the spot and mix it with hot milk. 
,,,,,The cinnamon bun was oh-so-good. Comparable in flavor with Cinnabon... but I prefer this because the butter and sugar melted then hardened to create an awesome sugar crust on all available surface of the pastry. Perfect if you're having unsweetened coffee or tea.

,,,,,"Delicious handcrafted locally curated coffee, right in the heart of Pike Place Market! They also have exceptionally delicious treats. (Their breakfast sandwiches are to die for!)"
,,,,,Really nice spot. We loved our drinks so much that we went back the next day. They also have a great view of the Pike Place Market sign.
,,,,,Had a wonderful chai latte here. The staff are incredibly friendly and the coffee shop has great views of Pike Place.
,,,,,"Okay, yes the coffee is ridiculously expensive. But is it worth paying $7 for an iced latte? YES. And if you're new to the store, you get a free mug! I mean, seriously, how much more could you want. "
,,,,,The ratio of oatmilk to espresso shots is just perfect and they don't overdue it with the sweetness. One of the best cafes I've been to.
,,,,,Service:
,,,,,"Sweet, sweet people work here! Shout out to Amelie!"
,,,,,Thank you for being so kind and patient and for recommending the vanilla latte! 
,,,,,The customer service here is great. Thank you for appreciating all of us coming in here. Total win-win!
,,,,,Environment:
,,,,,"Cool spot! Warm vibes! Modern with wood floors/nature feel around. Leather couches and wooden coffee tables.There's even a fireplace!-So cozy. Great for reading, sipping your drank or getting some work done."
,,,,,Coffee:
,,,,,I ordered the vanilla latte and definitely recommend for a creamier lighter taste! 
,,,,,Also try the chocolate cake! Super moist and fluffy. Yum!
,,,,,Recommend you to come check it out!
,,,,,One of the best mochas and a gorgeous fireplace to enjoy it. Definitely check it out!
,,,,,"It was our first time visiting and it was a great experience. There was a bit of the line, but there is space to sit down. There is a few individual couches near a fire place and there is also some tables and a bar next to an open window. It was a great escape from the rain and it has a great view! The Chai latte was great, they have a broad selection of milks. It was the perfect temperature from the get go, I was so happy I didn't have to wait or burn myself. The cold brew was delicious, it was a mild taste, and not overpowering. Great ambiance and we can't wait to come back. The staff was really nice, overall an amazing experience!"
,,,,,A year later and we are back in Seattle and back at Storyville! I love this place! The coffee is delicious and the staff is always super friendly. 
,,,,,"Yes, they still have the free mug promotion!"
,,,,,Absolutely a must when in Seattle. 
,,,,,"Walked by this place the other day but just had a cup of coffee and did not stop, today I did some research on 'best coffee spots in Seattle' and this one popped up and it happened that I was again in the area the following day. "
,,,,,"We had the french press and americano and the taste was so good, I couldn't leave without buying a pack of ground coffee for myself to bring back home. "
,,,,,"We also got a free mug that was a nice bonus. But wait, there's more, we were also offered a free slice of cake that was fresh from the oven. That had to be the best chocolate coffee cake I've had in a while. The base was not too sweet and the coffee spread on top was a bit bitter but complimented the cake very very well. "
,,,,,This place was one of our Seattle highlights. Loved it! 
,,,,,"Great customer service, friendly and welcoming people."
,,,,,I got the latte with soy milk and it was very good! The soy milk gave it some creaminess and did not separate. I've ordered some soy milk lattes that have a bad texture because the coffee was too hot when the soy milk was added. The service here is also amazing. Someone was going around the shop to ask if everyone wanted wanted and got them a glass of water. 
,,,,,I'm not sure how often they do this but if you're buying coffee from Storyville for the first time they'll give you a free mug (a great souvenir)!
,,,,,The coffee was great and the staff were so friendly. I'll be back soon!
,,,,,"Free Mug cute design on a Latte , overall good experience "
,,,,,"Coffee itself was normal , nothing different than what I've had before . The atmosphere is good."

,,,,,"OBSESSED WITH THIS SPOT. Went back to back days. Got a free mug! Their homemade coconut macadamia milk is to die for! So delicious! The espresso is unreal! Order a oat milk or a housemade coconut cashew milk latte, iced or hot, and you will NOT be disappointed. Forever recommending this spot to my people! Enjoying this coffee is SF right now...!!"
,,,,,We had the iced brew and mocha coffee. The coffee here is good. There is a lot of seating and the place looks really good. This month they have a free cup reward and I love the cup. The service is great here. There might be a line but worth the wait.
,,,,,"come for a cup of coffee or the vibes - either way, you won't be disappointed. "
,,,,,we got an iced americano and iced almond milk latte. both were great - no bitterness like i sometimes find in cheaper coffees. 
,,,,,the place is nicely decorated with warm tones. they have a reading/sitting couch on the side and a fireplace and seats on the other end.
,,,,,the staff is very friendly and even offered a slice of freshly baked chocolate cake (heard this might be a regular thing if you get you're timing right)! 
,,,,,would definitely visit again when i'm back in seattle!
,,,,,4.5 Stars.
,,,,,Pretty much a mandatory stop by whenever within a 5 mile radius.  
,,,,,"This particular location, is a bit hard to find if you have never been.  If you're being guided by your GPS map, you will make a couple circles around the building and not find it as there is no obvious signage.  It's actually on the second floor, so find the stairs and go!"
,,,,,"The staff here are ultra friendly and comfortable.  They do seem overworked though, but they keep coming back for the love of the coffee.  After trying quite a few of their drinks, I feel the plain old mainstay vanilla latte is the best.  Its ultra smooth, dessert satisfying.  Perfectly hot, you will have a huge smile as you sip and enjoy the dim, warm, cavey decor that everyone loves and posts on IG."
,,,,,"Pro tip:  Stay away from the chocolate cake unless you love an ultra strong, rich taste."
,,,,,"Pro tip:  Currently have a promotion if you sign up your email with them, you get a free coffee mug.  But beware, its a pain to carry around if you don't have a backpack or bag to put it in if you intend to keep strolling Seattle."
,,,,,"Again, a mandatory stop if you are nearby!!!!!!!"
,,,,,"Loveeee this coffee shop in Pike Place! Have tried several coffees here and hands down they have the best lattes in town.. i have tried their hot chocolate and their house tea (chai) and i loved the perfect balance of spice and herby tea flavor.. this is a nice cozy bright coffee shop in downtown.. loads of space inside, friendly service and great coffee.. what more can one ask for.. they do serve a free slice of their divine chocolate cake on some random days.. also got a chance to try out their delicious chocolate sea salt cookie (this was truly amazing).. they also offer a free coffee mug when you subscribe to their mailing list! I come back here every time I am at Pike Place and am never disappointed.. wish they opened a franchise in West Seattle.. until then I will keep coming back.."
,,,,,"A small, cozy coffee shop that is somewhat hidden in Pike Place that gives a rustic chic vibe (interior) among the bustling outside world. It's not stuffy due to being small but lively and just right "
,,,,,"The coffee and tea is great and their freshly baked pastries every few hours, made in house are devine! The lemon cake looks like a large cupcake which is quite big too. The star was the caramel cookie! A simple sweet treat to go with any drink and any weather. Goods are displayed behind the ordering counter. Alternative milk options available too"
,,,,,The service is genuine as the baristas take time to help and talk to you- you can get a complimentary mug in exchange for an email if it's your first visit. They were passing out water glasses and picking up after customers.
,,,,,"Seating ranges from chairs, long tables, bar style seating, and sectional couches (with outlets at the bottom). Restrooms are located outside with a key and clean. "
,,,,,"Do some work with free wifi, hang out, or take a little break from the market outside. A time to relax and get refreshed and with multiple locations I can see Storyville becoming a go to spot"
,,,,,"If you're wandering around Pike Place Market and looking for some coffee, I'd highly recommend Storyville. Our local friend took us here and I was pretty impressed. It's tucked away within the market so it was a little less busy when we arrived. The baristas were all occupied so it took a bit to get our order in but we weren't in much of a hurry. I ordered an iced mocha and my boyfriend got a latte. According to the menu, the mocha is made with housemade chocolate syrup so I was sold! It was sweet and chocolatey and delicious. I'd definitely order it again. They had a promotion going on when we visited - provide your email address for their email newsletter and get a free coffee mug! We didn't partake but it's a pretty cool idea. I was curious about the little boy logo and one of the baristas told me it's loosely based on the owner but you can interpret it however you want."
,,,,,"We ended up purchasing a bag of coffee to take home - I really liked it because it's in a flat bag which makes it easier to pack in a carry on! My only complaint is that it was pretty toasty inside on a warm day and they had a fireplace going. It was too hot for me to comfortably lounge with my beverage, but I would definitely stop here again."
,,,,,"Wow - BEST MOCHA EVER!! In Pike's Place on 3rd floor. No wonder raving reviews. Awesome service. Great coffee. The staff was super friendly. They definitely put a lot of love into their coffee.  Great tag line ""Love Everybody"".  Can't wait to try their coffee at home."
,,,,,I've been to Seattle 3 times now and just now found it. This is a hidden gem that I highly recommend if you're looking to relax with your coffee. It hidden so you will need to find the stairwell by the corner of 1st and Pike and then walk all the way to the top floor. I wish we found this sooner.
,,,,,"This gem is hidden in Pike Place Market & is pretty spacious for a coffee shop. It has great views of the sound and if I was still in college, I would 10/10 make this one of my go-to study spots!"

,,,,,Thought this place was very cute. The Cinnamon bun was sooo delicious. Latte was tasty. The people that work here are super nice. Not sure why folks are complaining - it's clearly a tourist destination that caters to ....tourist. The view is great and nice place to start your day checking out pike market (and a little souvenir in the cup).
,,,,,"Making my way through the public market when I stumbled across the sign for Storyville coffee. It's a little hard the find, but the track up 3 flights of stairs is worth it. While waiting in line, you can scan a QR code for a free coffee mug gift for simply being patient while waiting in line. On top of that, if you buy a bag a coffee beans your cup of coffee is free! I wish I wasn't in a rush because this atmosphere is laid back and perfect for meeting a friend for a post COVID re-unification. My cafe mocha was perfect. Bitter dark chocolate that was smooth as silk to sip on."
,,,,,"Wifey and I are visiting Seattle. We came to Storyville three years ago, And she wanted to come back. Due to Covid precautions, there was a wait/line to get in - but it was well worth it. We ordered a cinnamon roll that came steaming hot out of the oven. Delicious! Yum. The texture and the taste really hit the spot. Love the hot, soft and gooey center contrasted with the outer crispy crust. The cinnamon roll is a little on the smaller-side but it's so rich, anything larger would be too much. A definite must try  oh, and the cappuccinos were perfect!"
,,,,,"A bit hard to find we went in circles trying to find it, but feels like speakeasy and they gave us free mugs! Good coffee and friendly staff"
,,,,,"It's been a while since I've been here! I got the ice chai latte. Price is expensive for sure $6, alternative milk options +$1. Flavor is amazing though. They still seem to have their free mug when you scan a QR code at the entrance and add your email."
,,,,,"So cute! Love the environment inside - different seating options, dim lighting, kinda reminded me of a bar but really relaxing and a good place to have a chat with friends. They also have out free mugs to first time customers (originally priced at $15) so my friends and I were really satisfied."
,,,,,Grabbed an Americano in the morning when they opened on Saturday. Americano was solid and if you subscribe to their email newsletter you get a free mug! Only complaint is that the prices are ridiculously high.
,,,,,"Best chai latte I've ever had, and the ambience was amazing. The view makes for a great place to catch up with old friends."
,,,,,"We each got a mocha and they came out with cute hearts. Our toddler was offered a complimentary ""kid cookie"" which he loved! As it was our first visit we were also offered a free mug with their logo. Prices are higher than Starbucks but quality & ambience made it worth it. We enjoyed sitting down indoors and the view! Very friendly staff! It's a little tricky to find but a gem!"
,,,,,"This is one of the most amazing coffee shops. Fantastic coffee, cool atmosphere, and very friendly staff. I wasn't intending to go in (just shopping and walked by), but I am certainly glad I did."
,,,,,"Forget the original ""Starbucks"" a few blocks away and visit Storyville. Much better coffee!!!"
,,,,,"I'll be honest - I like Splenda. I like cream. I buy a locally roasted bean, grind it and prepare it at home. But I wouldn't consider myself a 'coffee snob'. "
,,,,,So perhaps places like this that focus on all organic/natural/etc are just not appreciated by people like me.
,,,,,So please take my review with that grain of salt in mind. 
,,,,,"The service was SOOOO friendly. They offer a nice mug if you sign up to their mailing list. The sitting room was very nice as well, although I wouldn't say social distancing was being practiced."
,,,,,"The coffee was just OK. They don't have artificial sweeteners and only had smaller sizes. Also, super difficult to find this place! We got lost looking for it and then stumbled across it last minute. I couldn't tell you how to get there, to be honest."

,,,,,"Oh my goodness-the salted caramel latte and cinnamon roll were amazing! We stayed in Seattle for 4 days and we didn't find a better coffee. I'm so glad we stopped by! If we go again, we'll definitely be back."
,,,,,"What an adorable nook-type coffee shop! Tucked away at the top by the market, this place is such a cool lil' gem! The service was great & gave great recommendations! I went in wanting something refreshing but not coffee, & they recommend an Italian soda. They had a ton of flavors, but I decided to go with the vanilla & was not let down at all! Creamy & delicious- it was made perfectly! On top of all that, they give you a free mug when you sign up :)"
,,,,,Long-time Storyville customer. Like really long. Like I remember when they were connected to Mars Hill and sourced most of their staff there - long. 
,,,,,I always loved that the pike place location was in the market but hidden so locals AND tourists could discover it and get great coffee from people who clearly cared about the product and experience. 
,,,,,"I'd go there to work. I'd go there to meet friends, I'd go on dates there. I loved it."
,,,,,"So yesterday, i go into the pike place location and order an iced latte to share with my GF. The barista tells me it will be 8.75. I remind him we only got one latte. He replies with ""yeah, we had a small price increase recently"". I said "" how much is it without the ice? "" same price""  he replies. "" so you're doubled the price of your coffee and that's a small price hike?"" I say. He shrugs his shoulders and stared blankly at the checkout ipad."
,,,,,"Furious, I swipe my card. "
,,,,,"How is it every other coffee vendor in the market still has reasonable prices (ghost espresso in post alley, for example). "
,,,,,how many free pieces of chocolate cake do you have to give away to justify an almost $10 latte?!
,,,,,I'm out. It was fun while it lasted. Good luck with loving everybody via seeing what you can get away with charging them.
,,,,,"Once a hip coffee shop I loved, now a tourist trap ripoff that I used to know."
,,,,,"I've heard good things about this coffee shop and it didn't disappoint! I ordered a latte and it tasted great, in addition since it was my first time visiting they gave me a free Storyville mug! The service was great as well and the line was long but moved quickly!"
,,,,,Tasty coffee but a bit pricier than competition! 
,,,,,October 2020: They give out free cups if you sign up for their email distribution list.
,,,,,"Originally the shop was difficult for me to find, but it was well worth the seek! Everyone was so helpful and sweet. Thank you Esmeralda"
,,,,,Stopped by on a Sunday evening about 30 minutes before they close and a few tables were occupied. My husband ordered the cappuccino and I went with the Latte with Coconut Cashew milk and I loved the creaminess and toasted coconut flavors. Staff was welcoming and service was quick!
,,,,,This place is a bit hidden; we found it by chance.  Enjoyed their coffee so much; we decided to get monthly subscription
,,,,,"This coffee shop is on the top floor of the corner building. You can access it from the entrance on Pike St. Just go up the stairs all the way and you'll see the clearance. It helps to look out for their logo on the street level floor if you're having trouble finding it. They have a promotion where you get a free porcelain mug (brown or white, worth $15) if you sign up with them using your email address (if you're a first time customer). There was a bit of a wait when we got there at 9:15am on a rainy Sunday (about 30 min). The line moves a bit slow for a coffee shop but I didn't mind the wait. I tried the cold brew latte with their house-made coconut cashew mylk, and it was delicious. The coffee has no sour after taste and is richly deep in flavor. The mylk adds a smooth balance to the cold brew. I loved the interior of this place because it adds to the coziness on a rainy day in Seattle. Definitely stop here if you're in the area for the yummy drinks and the nice vi"
,,,,,This is the most amazing coffee and atmosphere! Lucas was so kind and went out of his way to identify the ingredients in their baked goods. I would  come to Seattle just for Storyville coffee!

,,,,,Seattle has a lot of coffee shops and this place in Pike Place Market is really special. Service was so warm and friendly. The ambience is great. You can get a nice view of the market. They yummy baked goods.
,,,,,"Storyville is my all time favorite coffee shop in Seattle! And yes it is a very touristy destination,   "
,,,,,but it always brightens up my day to grab a coffee from Storyville and take a stroll around Pike's Place. The drinks here are freaking delicious and 100% worth the exorbitant price tag (~$7/drink). 
,,,,,Now I'm no coffee connoisseur by any means but 
,,,,,"I do appreciate the deep and smooth flavor of their signature beans. It's strong but not overly bitter and pairs so perfectly with their housemade coconut cashew mylk. Seriously the best alternative milk I've tried in my life... If I lived within walking distance of this place, I imagine would have a large whole in my wallet from the excessive number of coconut cashew mylk lattes I would consume. "
,,,,,Also a big fan of their cold brew latte (with the coconut cashew mylk of course). Have yet to try their pastries but they look freaking delicious too!
,,,,,Do not forget to scan a QR code to get your free mug with the purchase. Those mugs are very tasteful and cute. One of the best chai lattes I've tried!
,,,,,Kate! Thanks for the great review! I'm so sorry I mixed up your name in my previous message. I guess I need more coffee :)
,,,,,"The vibes in this coffee shop. Cozy, modern, warm perfection. The line can be a bit long so try to show up around 9 am, order anything with the house made syrup (oat milk mocha was my favorite), and cuddle up on one of the big leather wrap around couches with views of the sound. I'm not sure it's possible to have a better start to your morning than that."
,,,,,"I've been here a few times and the people who work here have always been very friendly, fast service and super helpful. The coffee is delicious (they make a good cold brew) and the cookies are tasty (i liked the salted caramel, not too salty). Its a bit hidden but easy enough to get to. I love walking through Pike Place with my dog since its only a few blocks from where i live. The space itself is quite beautiful with a great view of the market."
,,,,,Great place with wonderful coffee! Love the ambience of the place! Highly recommend and a place you shouldn't miss when visiting Seattle. 
,,,,,Oh they also have a free drink with any coffee bag purchase which was a nice little perk
,,,,,The coffee is pretty pricey and the line is long... Also pricey if you get their homemade cashew/coconut milk... But worth it! The view from the top it was really great and I wish we had time to sit there but since the line was so long we were in a hurry and couldn't stay so I would just say go when you have some time to really enjoy it. Plus the pricing this is made up for it because they give away a free coffee mug to all first time customers if you sign up your email!
,,,,,"A local recommended this coffee shop and they were wild about it. While the staff were nice, we found our honey latte to be a bit of a drab."
,,,,,"On the bright side, it's a very cozy, roomy shop with plenty of seating/lounging area and even a fireplace. We came on a quiet morning, so it was pleasant to just sit and enjoy the morning."
,,,,,Good coffee and great service. really cool asthetic.
,,,,,"Once you are able to find the somewhat difficult entrance on the 2nd floor, you will be pleasantly surprised at the coffee nirvana you have stumbled upon. The interior has a warm, bustling vibrant vibe, full of people chatting, steam hissing, and clanking of espresso and coffee cups. "
,,,,,"The views of the waterfront along the back windows are breathtaking, and spectacular on certain days. Seating is cozy and intimate but not uncomfortably so. I ordered a cappuccino and it was creamy, thick, and robust with a dark rich espresso flavor. I could drink one of these every single day."
,,,,,"The cashier was quite cheery and friendly. At the end of my transaction, she asked if I had already signed up for their mailing list and if not, I could sign up on the tablet next to her and I would receive a beautiful Storyville ceramic mug right then and there. Needless to say, I signed right up. I can't wait to return here on my next trip to downtown Seattle."

,,,,,"This coffee shop has a rather popular reputation, which definitely inclined me to make a stop! It was my first stop of the day, and we chose to go to the location in Pike's Place. You have to go up a series of stairs to get to the location. Once there, only a certain people are allowed in at a time to maintain social distancing. I definitely appreciated this! I ordered the chai latte with coconut cashew mylk, and it was so incredibly creamy. The flavor was very and rich and unique. I loved it! The staff was also very kind, and interactive. Since it was my first visit, they gave me a free mug if I filled out a form. I appreciated the hospitality and loved my drink as well!"
,,,,,Delicious coffee the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had a really fun spot to meet up with friends or clients
,,,,,"I'm not joking that I had one of the best breakfast sandwiches of my life here. The pesto goat cheese breakfast sandwich is delicious. Down to the flaked sea salt on top, they pay attention to details. I enjoyed every bite. "
,,,,,"I will say that this is not where you should go if you're looking for a quick cup o' joe. They take time and pride in their coffee. It shows in the wait and the price point. However, my husband and I had a great experience here. If you have the time and cash, it's worth checking out. "
,,,,,"The location is fun! Tucked away above Pikes Place Market, it is cozy and inviting. Lots of seating."
,,,,,"During my most recent trip to Seattle in February of this year, I wanted to revisit Storyville Coffee in Pike Place Market in downtown Seattle, which is nice because it's also convenient to many other food and drink shops. It was a little tricky to find Storyville as it is on the 2nd floor up some stairs that bend around. Once you find the front entrance, you cannot miss it at the end of a corridor with large double glass doors and a sign above the doors."
,,,,,"When I visited them recently, it was a late Thursday morning and they were full of people. Although it was loud, it wasn't unbearable. You order at the counter off to the side of the front door. On this particular day, they were offering free mugs if you signed up for their mailing list. I ordered a cappuccino and it was so delicious. It was creamy, strong without being overly bitter, and it was just a smooth drink. I highly enjoyed it and this was one of the better cappuccinos I've had in recent memory. "
,,,,,"This place truly reminds me of a modern cafe. The interior makes you want to just hang out here for hours. There is a mix of high and low top tables, seating along the large window overlooking Pike Place Market, and some couch seating also. The cashier was super friendly and inviting. This is high on my coffee list for downtown Seattle, for whenever we can all travel again safely and without worry."
,,,,,They are so nice and they provided free cake to people! They also provide free cup. 
,,,,,I love this place!! Definitely go!
,,,,,The view is pretty 
,,,,,Its hard to find 
,,,,,The staff is super nice 
,,,,,Its clean and modern inside
,,,,,Coffee is good but nothing wow
,,,,,Highly recommend! First time here. We ordered cappuccino and cortado with oat milk. Excellent and tasty! First timers received a Storyville coffee cup. We thought that was a wonderful touch.
,,,,,"Great place to enjoy a cup of coffee. It seems to be a very famous coffee shop at the pike market. It's upstairs inside the market building so you need to take an elevator. I found nothing special abut the coffee. It's typical and medium roasted. The baristas were friendly. You can do dine in now but mask is still required (when not drinking or eating). The croissant was not very good, too dense and not buttery. The overall vibe was great and a nice place to sip a coffee looking out the bay."
,,,,,"Definitely not a cheap chai, but solid. The caramel cookie was outstanding. Also seems like it has a whole bunch of nice armchairs etc - also a big line, but worth it."
,,,,,"We have been here multiple times, but I never got around to posting my review! Came here most recently with my fiancé & pup for a Yelp Elite Perk and our experience was amazing as usual. We absolutely LOVE Storyville! They have an awesome atmosphere, fun games available to pass the time, amazing chocolate cake, pastries and delicious drinks. Service is always super friendly. In our most recent visit we decided to redeem our free drink, which was a regular latte and we also ordered a London Fog. W got to try their amazing Oat cookie with dried fruits bc we wanted to try something different, but I was very tempted by their chocolate chip cookies. It did not disappoint, the oat cookie was soooooo good, we had to go return and get another."
,,,,,"Storyville Coffee only service animals inside so my fiancé and I waited outside Storyville while our drinks were being made. They were super quick to make our drinks and they had a good flow of directing customers inside the café while maintaining 6ft distance apart. They were operating on limited capacity and seem to have COVID restrictions set up at the time of our visit. If you need to use the restroom its is located outside Storyville, past the elevators and you need to get the key from the cashier. Usually it is pretty well maintained and clean. After receiving our drinks we enjoyed a little walk around Downtown Seattle while snacking on our cookies. Cant wait to return to Storyville, we really enjoyed our experience here and loved our drinks! Till next time!"

,,,,,"Almond milk made on site? Absolutely incredible. Few places offer such high quality coffee drinks-- in fact, I can't think of another off the top of my head, and always friendly and capable staff."
,,,,,"We stopped in briefly with friends today. Luckily, a table came available right as we were ordering, so we were able to sit down. Our friends got cappuccinos, which came with cute little heart designs on top. My husband got the French press with soy milk as he's normally a drip coffee type of guy. He did say ""that was a good cup of coffee"", which is a solid compliment from him. I got the cold brew latte with house made coconut cashew mylk. I love cold brew, and this one was decent. It's a bit more acidic and tangy whereas my favorite flavor profile is nuttier. The drinks are expensive here, but the ambience is nice and there's a cool view of pikes place. Also, if you give your information to them, you can get a free coffee cup!"
,,,,,"Busy place, yet staff was fast friendly and organized. I was having the best Expresso in the west coast back in July 2021, thinking about this place makes me miss Seattle."
,,,,,"Not the best coffee I've ever had. I ordered a cappuccino but I didn't taste a drop of chocolate in my drink. The size felt really small. The only reason I'm giving them a 3 star is because they gave me a free mug for signing up for emails and because the ambiance is really nice in the restaurant. I could totally see myself studying here if I lived in Seattle. Lots of spaces to sit down, cute deco too."
,,,,,"Man oh man, Storyville Coffee delivered on all fronts. The coffee was good, food was really tasty, ambiance was super nice, and they had a kind first-time gift. This is now my bae's favorite coffeehouse in Seattle aside from the Reserve Roastery. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,This is one of my favorite coffee places in Seattle. The ambiance. The coffee. The croissants. The people. And my sister loves it so it's a plan to come here every time she visits. 
,,,,,Sometimes there is a line at the cashier so you do not need to wait in line again to order another croissant (ahem) if you are eating at your table. The nice waiter/waitress will bring you one and you pay while sitting.
,,,,,"Storyville Coffee is a killer place to pick up a much needed cup of joe. It's off the beating path, third floor. No line when I went on a Friday morning, got lucky I guess. "
,,,,,Delicious cappuccino that was well crafted 
,,,,,Will be returning 
,,,,,Oh and I got a free mug for signing up with an email  freeeee
,,,,,"Came here on a weekday. The spot is nice, quiet, with plenty of seating. I love how tranquil it was, with a view over Pike Place Market. "
,,,,,"Ordered a regular coffee and a croissant, which they asked if I wanted a fresh one out of the oven in a few minutes. Croissant is probably average, but the ""out of the oven"" thing was pretty awesome."
,,,,,"I also loved that they had a house-made coconut cashew milk. Although I'm not dairy-free, I had to give it a try and it added a lovely creaminess and depth to my coffee."
,,,,,"Overall - like the range of options, relaxing and study atmosphere, and service!"
,,,,,"This place is definitely worth a come if you are looking for a pick me up. Kind of difficult to find, on the third floor so we had to go through some elevators to find it but overall the quality of the coffee and tea is pretty good. I ended up getting a standard iced tea and put creamer in it, and it tasted very much like if I did the same thing at McDonald's, but higher end (to make it taste like milk tea) however when you check in, you get a free mug and sometimes they provide chocolate cake, which I unfortunately was not there at the right time to get. However this looks like a really great place to just relax or sometimes and get out of the hustle during your day at pikes."
,,,,,I went Seattle earlier this year. Best Espresso I have ever had. Been ordering online and customer service knows how to run a business. They take care of their customers and in return I will keep on ordering!

,,,,,"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Called too ask if they were open, they said yes. We drove 30mins in from the city just for them to say they are closed. Didn't even the courage to confront us at the door to give us a reason or to apologize. Never again will I come back!"
,,,,,"Such a cute coffee spot hidden next to Pike's Place that was surprisingly not overcrowded. My friend and I split the $7 mocha and it was sO good. We tried mochas at other places in seattle later and they tasted like sewer water compared to Storyville's mocha (albeit $3 dollars cheaper). The interior is well decorated and dim-lit, a perfect place to get to know someone or study."
,,,,,Beautiful setting in front of Pike Market. 
,,,,,This coffee might be hard to find since there is no sign in front. It is upstairs facing the Pike Market entrance. 
,,,,,"The line can be long, I waited for 30 minutes and another 10 minutes for the order while here on Sunday afternoon. "
,,,,,Services was great since they bring the hot bake to your table. 
,,,,,I loves the seating here as you can seated next to the windows or on the couch for relaxing afternoon enjoying your coffee or tea. 
,,,,,I don't t drink coffee or tea but my friends say their coffee is very good.  
,,,,,A good place to sit and relax after Pike Market.
,,,,,"Such a dope venue. Great coffee, great service and the decor makes you feel like you can there all day to just hangout. If I lived in Seattle I'd be a regular here."
,,,,,Good coffee. A bit over priced. I wouldn't order and of the pastries they leave out as I always see flies on them. But good coffee
,,,,,We had the weakest americanos ever last night. This place isn't what it used to be and there are definitely better options in downtown.
,,,,,"One of my favorite places to get coffee in Seattle. Such a cute place, and such good coffee too! Afternoons are a great time to visit... enjoy a big cup of steaming coffee and a good book/conversation."
,,,,,Lovely ambience. Sweetest baristas. They were super generous and offered free coffee mugs. Would def love to visit again.
,,,,,"Honestly, I'm shocked after visiting here. It used to be a pretty decent coffee shop with somewhat more expensive, but not crazy coffee. I haven't visited in a while, since all of their locations besides the pike place seem to be closed and I'm shocked. $10 for a cup of oat milk latte. That is just insane. They are not even the best coffee shop around. No idea how they are able to charge $36 for 1lb of roasted coffee. That's into specialty high end single origin pricing. No wonder they can't open up more locations, the prices are insane and the coffee is not something to rave about. We stopped by since my wife used to like this place and she got a drink. It was honestly middle of the road coffee. I had a truly great shop at GP just earlier in the day and that did not cost anywhere near what Storyville is charging."
,,,,,"Used to love visiting, after this crazy pricing with no real justification, not really worth making the trip back out. There are way better and more iconic Seattle coffee shops that have actual good coffee that could fetch such a premium. Storyville, not so much, I think they have lost their minds."
,,,,,"Tiny coffeeshop, friendly service, great coffee, great sandwiches.  Was here on their opening weekend and they gave me a free mug which I still use.  Would visit more often if I lived closer."

,,,,,"Being new to Seattle, I read so many blogs and ""must try"" lists that ALL included Storyville, so I was very eager to try it. With the exception of their flagship in pike place market, all of their shops are currently on pause so the hardest part of getting my hands on a cup was coordinating a time to be at pike place after 9 am (a hard feat as I am an early riser). "
,,,,,"I finally made it happen and can attest to the hype being real - one of the absolute best coffees I've ever tasted. My go to is an almond milk latte and this was truly perfect - smooth, creamy, velvety texture with a bold coffee forward flavor that honestly tasted like chocolate (even tho it was a syrup free latte)! It was rather pricey, clocking in at $7.50 for a 12oz but honestly the taste was 100/10. "
,,,,,"Not to mention it's super chic (you don't even feel like you're in pike place), the staff are really friendly, and the overall vibe is really cozy. I can't wait til their other shops reopen (hopefully earlier in the day too) so I can frequent :). "
,,,,,100% not to be missed while in Seattle!
,,,,,Great place to stop for coffee in Pike's Market- came here early Friday and still had a line out in the front- slow moving.  They seemed to encourage everyone to sign up for a free mug which is a super nice gesture.  The kids also get a free airplane tickets which I have not seen another coffee shop do this.  My salted caramel latte was good- pricey considering size of the cup.  My husband didn't like the cashew milk which is their specialty- very strong coconut taste that overwhelms the coffee taste.
,,,,,Great place to sit and look out onto the street below hit hard to distance 6 feet.  For the bathroom there is a chip key hanging on the column near the counter and be sure to key into the glass door at the end of the hallway (not the bathroom for men or women) right next to the elevator.
,,,,,I stop by here every time I visit Seattle.
,,,,,Honestly that sentence should say it all BUT:
,,,,,I just tried their cold brew latte and WOWOWOW
,,,,,Their chai is good if you have a sweet tooth--get it with the cashew milk!
,,,,,Regular hot lattes are bomb af
,,,,,Service is almost always spectacular!
,,,,,It's just... Prices! I get that it's in Pike but also... $9 for a latte?! It's worth it though if you just stop by once. I promise!!!!
,,,,,"First time at Storyville Coffee Company. I do say that this place was hard to find, and I had to ask around to find the location. But with all patience, the location is beautiful and very urban! It has a great view above Pike Place Public Market and also comfy couches and long wooden tables.   Great design. "
,,,,,"Coffee: 5 stars! I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but this place doesn't disappoint. I got the hot almond milk late and it had just the right amount of sweetness and coffee. My friend received the earl grey tea as well, so they have a wide variety of different flavors for almost all taste buds. "
,,,,,*I also received a free mug by subscribing to their email list* . 
,,,,,"Overall, this place has great coffee, with Instagram worthy photos, and overall great vibe. Would definitely visit again when I'm in town."
,,,,,"It took awhile to find this place because it's on the second floor - just go up the stairs past the crumpet shop. Not sure I understand the hype around this place but it's overpriced - don't remember the last time I paid $6+ for a latte. It was kinda small and a little below average in terms of taste, latte art was cute though! My friend got the cortado and his cup arrived 3/4 full... all of us were like ???"
,,,,,Super good coffee flavor. Free mug when you sign up on the iPad. Baristas are very friendly. Great atmosphere. Wonderful view.
,,,,,"If you're making a trip to Pike Place, visiting Storyville is a must. I visited the shop at 11am on a Saturday and the line was quite long. I ordered a mocha with oat milk and Gary's oatmeal for a late breakfast totaling $18. Whew...prices are not cheap. All in all the mocha was good (not amazing) and the oatmeal was alright. In my opinion I paid more for the ambience instead of high-quality drinks/food. That being said, the interior is super cozy and well-decorated. Also first time customers receive a free mug which is awesome! "
,,,,,Coffee: 4/5
,,,,,Food: 3.5/5
,,,,,Ambience: 5/5
,,,,,Price: 2/5
,,,,,"Real great atmosphere, awesome interior, friendly service. Great for locals and visitors alike"
,,,,,Helpful tip:
,,,,,It's on the damn second floor 
,,,,,No wonder we couldn't easily find it. Had to ask a store clerk after 5-10 mins of walking in circles. 
,,,,,"But it's worth it. The store decor is trendy and lots of sitting areas to relax and enjoy your cup of Joe. Even got a free mug by signing up for their newsletter. My Latte was done to perfection, smooth and lightly foamy."
,,,,,Please try to keep this a secret since it would be a great spot to get away from all the tourists at Pike Place Market.
,,,,,So excited to find this sweet place upstairs from Pike Place Market! The coffee is delicious and the atmosphere is so pleasant! 
,,,,,"Indoor seating is allowed and reasonable spaced, the staff is super friendly and the coffee is wonderful!! "

,,,,,"Love this place! One of my favorite coffee shops in all of Seattle, that I will drive 45 minutes (one way!) for :)"
,,,,,"Since COVID, I've only made it over one time so I figured it was a perfect day to go with the sun out and a day off from work. What I love about Storyville at Pike Place is that it's a hidden gem where there's usually not too many people so you can get a seat while enjoying some bomb coffee. "
,,,,,"The coffee itself is super yummy - probably one of the town's best mochas I've had. My husband usually enjoys their chais :) They used to do free samples of their pastries pre-COVID, and that was a huge perk and a great way to preview what they offered, which used to be a wide variety of selections. This time, however, they only had plain croissants, sugar cookies and small cinnamon rolls - I decided to try the roll, and it was delicious, though super sweet. "
,,,,,"One downside that I noticed this time around - and this might be due to COVID - was that it was quite pricier than I remembered! For a 12 oz mocha and a cinnamon roll, I paid $13, which is pretty expensive for what I got - hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, this place is amazing and I'm definitely coming back!!"
,,,,,"From the service, ambiance, and quality of food and drinks, Storyville definitely lives up to the well-deserved praise. Upon entering, staff was extremely friendly and helpful on recommendations. I went with a vanilla cold brew latte and chocolate chip cookie with flaky salt. They were both super good! "
,,,,,"The cold brew was smooth and was really enjoyable and not too sweet. The cookie had a slightly chewy texture, crisp exterior, and the flaky salt on top was a great finish to it."
,,,,,I highly recommend Storyville and please support this great business in Pike Place!
,,,,,"Let me just start by saying, I'm not usually a coffee person. I'll pick up the occasional Starbucks, but my coffee knowledge and expertise is relatively low. However, Storyville's latte was SO GOOD that I returned twice during my trip to Seattle. My husband loves Americanos, so we were on a mission to find the best in Seattle. When compared to other local favorites (Monorail Espresso, Ghost Alley, Fremont Coffee, etc.), Storyville was the clear winner as far as I'm concerned. I tried the regular latte with whole milk and a caramel latte. Both were creamy, the perfect temperature, and had great flavor profiles. Storyville is a MUST when visiting Seattle!"
,,,,,"The amazing swath of coffee aromas permeating the hallway was what drew us in.  The coffee smells amazing!  And, it tastes just as good.  It is delicious!"
,,,,,"I chose a Latte & my hubby went for the Cortada.  We learned a Cortada is a a mix of froth, milk and espresso.  Both were amazing!"
,,,,,"The ambiance is nice; imagine a Seattle coffeehouse and this is exactly that.  Soft music, comfy leather couches, low lighting."
,,,,,"We had a hiccup on ordering but an amazing Barista stepped up and took great care of us.  We waited in line to order.  As my husband began to order, the two female Baristas told him he had to wait in line.  My husband looked confused as we had just been standing in line but began to walk in line. "
,,,,,"I said ""Wait a minute. We were just in line, waited, and now it's our turn to order.  Is that not how this works?""  Both female Baristas just looked at me and didn't say anything.  A very friendly young man came right over and said ""No worries! I got you. What would you like?"" He was great; made our drinks and got us all sorted. Thank you!"
,,,,,Highly recommend stopping in!
,,,,,"What a beautiful little coffee shop. It was my first time at Storyville and I was honestly super surprised at how aesthetically pleasing it is inside. When walking up the stairs to get inside, I had no idea it would be so nice inside."
,,,,,"ANYWAY, aside from its good looks, my experience at Storyville was great. The baristas behind the counter were extra personable and welcoming. I got an almond milk latte with vanilla syrup (sadly, no sugar-free options, but they told me they make their own vanilla syrup). My latte was a 4/5, but my oatmeal fruit cookie was at least a 7/5. The barista described it to me as a trail mix cookie and I was sold. It was perfectly baked... crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle. I could eat one (or maybe six) every day."
,,,,,"They gave away free mugs if you entered your name and email on their iPad. My boyfriend came along with me, so we got two free mugs. :-)"
,,,,,"Overall, I had a fantastic experience and can't wait to come back to have another oatmeal fruit cookie."
,,,,,"Came here on a Sunday morning around 11am and ordered an iced americano with a splash of almond mylk and vanilla. There wasn't that long of a line, but even so, the baristas are quick to make the order."
,,,,,"THEY MAKE THEIR OWN MYLKS & FLAVORS/SWEETENERS! The almond mylk I ordered was handmade and sweetened with medjool dates. The vanilla was also a housemade syrup!! This might just be my top tier favorite coffee (of all time?!) and the vibes inside the cafe were immaculate as well. Its located in the second story and feels as if you're drinking coffee in an NYC loft with its arched windows and exposed brick walls. The music was perfectly suited to the shop, and seating was abundant. I appreciate the interior design and overall ambiance of the cafe."
,,,,,"The staff was incredible. I can't begin to describe how absolutely upbeat, personable, and positive they were, and I would love nothing more than to just be a local at Storyville one day or/and befriend an barista because of how nice and genuine they were :')"
,,,,,"If you can't tell, I would 1000% come back!"
,,,,,"A fantastic gem in Seattle that makes you feel like you found a coffee speakeasy. My colleagues and I had some time while at a conference in Seattle, and we had to find out what the hype was about. Tucked away close to the market, we found this spot by taking the stairs up and we're greeted with a sun kissed hallway. The line ahead of the coffee shop was evidence enough that we found something magical. With lots of options, I wanted to try their signature- a cold brew latte (Cold brew mixed with oat milk Served on ice.). The cold brew came straight from the tap and was so incredibly smooth. I will say that I'm a long time coffee drinker that usually isn't that effected by caffeine, but this stuff was rocket fuel. Fantastic stop and highly recommend."
,,,,,"Absolutely my favorite coffee spot at Pike Place! Love the decor and seats with windows next to the market and I love the wood everywhere. I've been coming to this location for 2+ years and everytime, I feel super welcome and coffee is perfection!"
,,,,,"I typically order the Americano, but their mocha and lattes are good too. I believe all the lattes are the same. Their baked goods are even BETTER than expected. That croissant is life changing! Princi is good but the warm ones at Storyville are so deliciously buttery. The cookies also rotate and a good snack. "
,,,,,"Highly recommended! Love everything about them! And if you sign up for their mailing list, you get a free mug!"
,,,,,This place is great. It is tucked away in Pike Place market above the street vendors. You wouldn't be able to tell it was even there without the signs directing you. The inside space is very pretty and seems very modern for a coffee shop. There is a cozy fireplace that I would certainly have sat next to if I wasn't in such a hurry. Expect a line when going to this location as it is a popular tourist site. The staff were very friendly and helped you order. They were very calm and kind people. I really enjoyed my experience with them.
,,,,,"Honestly I love coming here everytime. The cafe itself is so pretty, and the coffee is a-ma-zing. I love their cold brew lattes and their cappucino!! The vibes are immaculate and the location is cute too, tucked away in a very busy part of downtown. "
,,,,,"It's expensive for sure, but I'd recommend you come here to sit for a while so you can proper enjoy. Also! If you sign up for their rewards you can get a free Storyville mug. Who doesn't want free things!! "

That being said, it was tricky to find and the almond mocha I ordered tasted delicious but was served a bit cooler than my preferred drinking temperature, my bad for not flagging it with the baristas. I'm sure they would have easily resolved the issue. "
,,,,,Good enough for me to seek out on my next visit!
,,,,,"i can't say enough good things about Storyville.. located at Pike Place upstairs on the 3rd floor, Storyville embodies what a perfect coffee shop should be. think spacious, welcoming, and cozy with exceptionally balanced coffee served by the most pleasant baristas. by far, Duc has been one of the most likable baristas i've ever had the pleasure of crossing paths with. him and another asian male barista were so kind to offer us various samples of in-house mylks and customer favorites. a trip to seattle without stopping by Storyville would be incomplete."
,,,,,The downtown location in Pikes Place was super warm and accommodating. The workers constantly walked around offering water and picking up dishes.
,,,,,They brought me free chocolate cake!
,,,,,They'll give you a free cup if you sign in with an email.
,,,,,I would come and find a comfortable spot and enjoy a cup of coffee from great staff.
,,,,,I'm a grumpy guy and was happy with everything. Only down side was that it was packed and long lines but worth the wait.
,,,,,The husband and I got the cold brew latte and iced vanilla latte. Both coffees were in point. Don't expect cheap prices 8.00 for a latte! Although you are paying for a prime location as it's in pike market and If you snag a seat by the window you get a nice view of the market. Very spacious with plenty of seating as it's upstairs next to Matt's by the kitchen. Plus as a first time visitor you can sign up for their rewards program and get a souvenir mug! Overall worth a visit and would come back again.
,,,,,"A quaint place in the hustle and bustle of PIKE place market. You get a good view of the bay as well. The staff are very friendly and polite. You get a free coffee mug if its your first time and you signup with you email. I got the Cortado, it was very good. Its located in the third floor, so just  be mindful of the stairs."

,,,,,"Cool little coffee shop. A little difficult to find, just walking in the market you wouldn't find it. Very dark on the inside though. Expensive however, $7 for a coffee then extra for syrups etc.. We got a vanilla latte which was very tasty. We did a cold brew latte too, which was bitter - they added a shot of vanilla syrup for us, which made it delicious - however for the price I wouldn't come back here."
,,,,,"This was by far the most delicious chai latte I have tried. It was so creamy, definitely recommend. The staff was really friendly and welcoming."
,,,,,This place had been on my bucket list for quite a while! We finally made it and were not disappointed. 
,,,,,We really loved their interior and the staff was super friendly. As first time customers we even received free coffee mugs to take home. 
,,,,,Their prices seem slightly expensive compared to other places ($25 for two lattes and a breakfast sandwich). The coffee was fantastic and the sandwich decent. Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back!
,,,,,"Overpriced, mediocre coffee. Go to Le Panier 2 blocks away. Better coffee and fantastic bakery."
,,,,,My favorite place to get a coffee when in Seattle. They make their cashew mylk in house and it's so good. A bit pricey but worth it for the occasional treat.
,,,,,"One of my favorite coffee shops in Seattle!  All of their locations are intimate and cozy, the coffee is delightful and so are their baked goods.  A great place to meet friends and hang out."
,,,,,Very friendly staff. Amazing and chic vibe. Can get noisy because of the location. The coffee is overpriced for sure and the Americano is just not up to the mark. It tastes pretty diluted and acidic. 
,,,,,"However, they do give free mugs for first time customers. Not sure if it is exactly free considering the cost of the coffee."

,,,,,Price - A little high however you do get a free cup to take home if it is your first visit. I think the price is fair given the location/service/aesthetic of the place. 
,,,,,Customer service - 5/5. They will come take your cup away when you're done and give you a glass of water.
,,,,,Honestly this place is overrated. It took twenty five minutes (we started at the first set of stairs after the doors) to get our drinks. 
,,,,,"The cold brew was ok, but added way too much coconut cashew milk to the latte and it was disgusting."
,,,,,"You're suppose to get a free coffee mug if you signup for their rewards program, which they are suppose to ask you, but our barista DID NOT. "
,,,,,Honestly unless you get the free mug for each person that stood in that line...it's really not worth it.
,,,,,We got two drinks and 2 cinnamon buns for $33-34.
,,,,,"This place is tucked away near public place market and I'm so glad we found it! The decor is very cute and cozy, perfect for studying or cracking open a book away from the noise of tourists. The coffee was great but the service was even greater. The gentlemen working were super helpful on picking a drink and very quick! Since it was my first visit I got a free mug and every time I see it, it reminds me of such a wonderful trip to Seattle."

,,,,,"It's already obvious, but don't go here if you don't drink coffee. Not only is the line long, but there aren't too many options for non-coffee drinkers who need a caffeine boost lol. I only came here because my friend wanted to try it out and we both needed some caffeine. "
,,,,,"I got the chai latte with a non-dairy milk sub and it came out to be almost $8! That is a ridiculous amount of money for a drink that tasted like oat milk. Not a fan. On the bright side, I did get a free mug so that's pretty cool. "
,,,,,"Overall, not a fan and wouldn't go back."
,,,,,COVID 
,,,,,"A bit hard for us to find somehow but it's on the stairs, not ground level."
,,,,,The decor was simple but modern with a fireplace and the brown color of Seattle. 
,,,,,Tried their latte which is very foamy and consistent. The hot from oven cinnamon roll has separate frosting dip and it's crunchy and chewy and gradually soft in the inside of the swirl. The breakfast sandwich is loaded with egg and bacon with cheese.
,,,,,We had. Hard time finding this place but it was totally worth it! It's on the second floor of the building just FYI. Coffee was great and so was the food and friendly service. Definitely recommend coming here.
,,,,,"This coffee spot is highly recommended! It took us a while to find this spot. It is located on the second floor in the market area. When we tried asking around for the location, no one seen to know where it was. I wasn't giving up that easily so we started walking all over the place for it and finally found it. When we got there, there was a line out the door but I wanted to wait and try out the coffee. The smell of coffee was so good just standing on line. It is a little pricey for the drinks but worth a try!"
,,,,,Great coffee. Great ambiance. And Amazing staff. Such great service. Sat down for a cup of coffee and was met with a complimentary piece of amazing chocolate cake. Amazing and friendly service. Great hidden gem in upper lofts
,,,,,Completely overhyped and just okay coffee. It's not worth the wait. 
,,,,,"We waited there for 15-20 minutes in line and there were only a good handful of people in front of us (~4 people). It's such a slow pace environment. They really take their time with making coffee or getting whatever other snack you ordered. I think people come here to get their complimentary mug if your first time, which it was for us but we weren't interested in that since we were travelling and didn't want to carry anymore things. I ordered the iced mocha and it wasn't anything special that I haven't tried before and it came out to be about $7-8 for a single drink. Definitely my first and last time at this place. "
,,,,,The environment was chill and there's plenty of sitting to drink your overpriced coffee.
,,,,,"We arrivd about 15 minutes before they opened at 9am and we were the second party in line.  Which worked out perfect because it gives you time to look over the menu and sign up for their mailing list on your phone to claim your free mug souvenir.  I tried the Cortado which is expresso with steamed warm milk.  It was good and I gulp it down probably too quickly since it's such a small cup. Hubby really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich. It had egg and bacon on a salted pretzel bun, it was delicious!  Most people opted for their coffee to go, so there were plenty of seatings available. Unfortunately for our friends who came about 15 minutes after us and the line got way too long.  So if you don't wanna wait definitely come early."
,,,,,"Unfortunately, this place has lost the plot. If more cafes  were on an imaginary Seattle coffee stock exchange, this would be the beginning of a Great Depression, led by storyville."
,,,,,"Returning post-covid to Seattle, I was a bit surprised to see only one Storyville cafe location open. As I walked up a flight of greasy ol stairs, that felt like one of LGA's boarding areas, I was pleasantly surprised to see no lines on a tue afternoon."
,,,,,"Ordered an iced latte with oatmilk that costed me $9. With a tip, this thing was ~$10-$11."
,,,,,"I then ordered a chocolate brownie cookie from their collection of tired looking bakery goods that sit behind the baristas, for some reason (perhaps the 30k ft view). When the cookie landed on my palms, after I paid $5 (incl tip), I realised this thing is as big as 4 bites. So that's more than $1 per bite."
,,,,,"I was expecting to feel elated and takeoff after this coffee. But after the very first sip, I had to deploy the emergency slides to get out of the top deck. All American Airlines serve better coffee than this flavorless, diluted, light, unrefined, tasteless, disgusting deluge that this place calls... coffee. It is an insult to the customer, to coffee, to Seattle, to the great tradition of baristas pouring a lovely cuppa for a distant traveler that's seeking comfort, warmth, and placing his/her trust in the coffee specialist."
,,,,,They did deliver an experience for my $15 alright. I left with an unwanted free mug - a reminder to make my own coffee at home. 
,,,,,"I've also ordered storyville beans to my own kitchen, and that's another tragedy altogether, for another time. "
,,,,,"The focus is now on being a commercial brand, instead of serving a value for money beverage. Finally, the coffee went into a bin where it belongs. A sad crash landing to what was a 5 star experience once before."
,,,,,"This review is not a spam- their cortado and interior decor is unique, coffees are rich aromatic, deep flavors, be ready for this amaxing experience, maybe the best coffee shop in America?

Plus, if you sign up for email you get a free mug and if you buy a bag of beans (for $18) you get a free coffee. I will definitely come again next time I'm in town."

,,,,,Would never have gone here had it not been for a meet up with a friend who suggested we stop by here on our trip to Pike Place Market (we are very much Seattle tourists but big fans of coffee who make our own cold brew at home). We like the lattes and hot coffees with oat milk at Stumptown but prefer the cold brew at Philz Coffee. 
,,,,,Tried the triple mocha with oat milk based off the rec from said friend as well as the cold brew latte with coconut cashew milk and vanilla based on Yelp. If I could do it over again I would stick with my friends rec. 
,,,,,"Love our souvenir mug! And the baristas were super nice. Thanks, Storyville!!!"
,,,,,This place really gave me a taste of that Seattle spirit that a coffee enthusiast/tourist hopes to find when visiting .... plus some. 
,,,,,"I woke up early, hopped on the quickest LYFT available just to make sure I was at their door just before opening but of course I was greeted by a long line of other anxious patrons waiting to make their way inside. Was I disappointed? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I took that as a good sign. A long line of people already waiting says a lot! "
,,,,,"The line moved fairly swiftly once the doors opened - the baristas, cashiers ... they worked with such coordination. It was clearly obvious that everyone knew their role and they worked with precision. How do I know? Because the cashier had accidentally forgotten to give  me a number for the pastry I'd ordered but as soon as I sat down and realized it .... Another employee had walked up to our table, asked me if I was supposed to have a pastry order (to which I'd confirmed) and within minutes I had my croissant and jam. It was like they'd already resolved the problem before I could even bring the problem to their attention. Pretty impressive."
,,,,,I love their location as well! It sits on the second floor with a view of the bay. The signage was a bit hard to notice though. If it wasn't for Yelp - I wouldn't have known they were even there. But thankfully we did. 
,,,,,"The vanilla latte is creamy (which is what I tend to order at most coffee shops), service is amazing, and the cafe is a great place to sit and chill. It kind of gave me that 'Central Perk' vibe (aka 'the cafe from Friends'). Five stars!"
,,,,,It's a beautiful local Seattle coffee shop in pike place. It has good amount of space and a beautiful view as you enjoy the hot morning coffee. I love their desserts too. Go on a Sunday morning to enjoy the place.
,,,,,"Delicious, quality coffee with a stunning top view of Pike place. Tucked in the upstairs corner of the market, you have to take the stairs or elevator to find this spot. The baristas here are so friendly and they offer a free gift (mug!) if you signed up for their emails. The coffee is well made and there are many spots to sit to enjoy the views, some sun (if you desire) and the quietness of the cafe. I love the deep and rich colors of the space and how they curated the tables and chairs. My friends and I loved coming here for our caffeine fix."
,,,,,"A very cute little coffee shop! I stumbled upon it because of the high ratings on Yelp and I have to agree with the reviews. It's a trendy spot by Pikes Place. The prices are a bit higher than average but they do a fantastic job. I signed up for their emails and got the cutest mug for FREE (yes, for free! And they sell them for $15!). I had an iced americano and it was tasty. The atmosphere of the coffee shop is warm and cozy. As we sat chatting with our drinks, they came around with complementary cake. I'm not sure if this was a one time thing but it was awesome! We all had a delicious slice of warm chocolate lava cake. We had such a good time resting and enjoying a cup of coffee here. Will definitely come back when in Seattle! :-)"
,,,,,I recently went to Seattle and this was my favorite coffee shop by far! The line was ridiculously long on a Saturday morning but it did move rapidly. 
,,,,,The whole interior is cute and they have plenty of tables to sit at. The coffee itself was pretty amazing- I got a latte and and my boyfriend got an iced latte. The latte just tasted superior to every other coffee I had.
,,,,,What really stood out to me was the barista- he was extremely nice and energetic and gave us some free mugs as a token of appreciation. What a thoughtful gift and such a nice souvenir from trip to Seattle. 
,,,,,"If you visit pike place, don't miss out on Storyville!"
,,,,,Overpriced and not even that good! 
,,,,,"There's a wait, which is I guess normal for Pike Place shops, but even on a Monday morning it felt like forever in line. The service was great, they were all really friendly, beautiful interiors. Would've loved to sit down had a spot opened up. This is a nice place to relax from the bustle down on the street. "
,,,,,"The oat milk (+$1) latte came out to a whopping $8. I come from SF and know overpriced coffee. This coffee didn't do me wrong, but it also wasn't very showy or had any spunk that could justify the premium price?"
,,,,,"I would personally pass, unless you want to try out the place and get your free mug, then the price might be worth it overall."
,,,,,"We got iced latte (decaf) with oat milk and iced latte with coconut cashew milk - both were delicious. However, two pitfalls with this location during the pandemic: "
,,,,,"1. The line is super long, the room is packed, yet they don't have any outdoor area or good ventilation system. "
,,,,,"2. Even now during the Delta surge, when masks are required for everyone indoor, they are still offering customers free samples in wide open cups, and customers waiting in line would just take off their masks, get a sample, chat with the staff while tasting the sample, spreading their saliva all over the sample plate."
,,,,,"Hi Lydia, thank you so much for your visit, your kind words and your very helpful feedback! We share and appreciate your concerns. This was our first weekend trying to improve the experience in the line with samples and your notes look much like ours. We have made changes to address these concerns and will be enhancing the line experience in new and more cautious ways. We really appreciate your help!"
,,,,,Very cute coffee shop. Definitely worth the wait. There was a bit of a line when we got here. The actual shop is on the third floor and not visible from the street. Once you get to the front of the line they are pretty quick and super friendly! 
,,,,,I got a cold brew with a splash of their homemade coconut cashew milk. My husband got a latte with vanilla syrup. Our friends got cold brew lattes. The warm latte was definitely the best and probably what they are more known for. 
,,,,,We also shared a warmed cinnamon roll and warmed croissant and they were delicious. The croissant was so buttery and flakey. Perfection. The cinnamon roll was also good.
,,,,,They also have free mugs for first time visitors. So sweet! I'll remember Storyville every time I use it.
,,,,,"The prices here are insane. If it was the best coffee of my life, I may have been able to justify it, but it was not. On the 3rd floor of a building with great views. Ample seating options. "
,,,,,"$8.75 for a cup of mocha. $18 for a half lb of coffee beans. Again, was not impressed. "
,,,,,"If you sign up for their newsletter, you get a free mug. My friend said she had too many mugs and they gave her a $7 gift card, which was nice."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"In Seattle, there are lots of great coffee shops. Some roast their own beans, and other get them supplied by one of the local roasteries.  Each have their own merits, but Storyville falls into the category that does it their own way.  "
,,,,,"Let's talk about the elephant first. Cost. They do charge more for their coffee. Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk flavor. I think for most people, there is a standard that sits around what you get at Starbucks, Dunkin, and something brewed at home.  That said, sometimes you get a coffee that tastes just a tad different.  Like the subtle flavors that wine presents, the coffee at Storyville is not the usual.  "
,,,,,"I would say that the coffee here has a fruity note, smooth (not burnt), and roasted chocolate taste to it.  All these seem to shine clearly when you get their Americano. There is something almost sweet about the flavor, when compared to the mass market coffee chains. "
,,,,,"They has plenty of delicious baked goodies, and before this entire Covid thing ruined everything, they used to offer up (randomly) Chocolate Cake slices. Those were pretty amazing. "
,,,,,"So if you are in Seattle, and willing to spend a little more, you may have found a great cup of coffee.  It's clearly a taste thing, so you may not like what you get, but for me, it's delicious and worth the effort to get to."
,,,,,"I dream of good coffee, and if you had to visit a place the makes SEATTLE the king of the coffee snobs, then Storyville is perfection in a cop.  Think rich, fruity, bitter yet balanced... smooth and tasty... it's everything you want in a coffee.. and more. "
,,,,,"I want you to think about wood tones, soft lighting, comfortable chairs, casual sounds and when all is said and done, it's wonderful."
,,,,,"What is there to say about Storyville, which hasn't been said about good Coffee and well-made baking.  I love this place, it's a tribute of what good coffee should be, Seattle style.  It's dimmed, warm wood colors, leather seats, and the glow of the sun beaming in.  They make coffee drinks right.  "
,,,,,"If it's something that's purely coffee and pressurized water, or a mix of milk and flavors, it's balanced, and the coffee always shines.  They always give me something I can be proud of.  It's done skillfully, I mean it's not a fast process, nor slow, but you see the controlled movements when they are making their coffee drinks.  I think there is something special when it comes to these people. "
,,,,,"Don't be rushed, they don't do rushed, and that's on purpose, you shouldn't rush in-and-out, it's a place to enjoy, and savor.  I challenge you to go, on a slow day for you, read a book, type a Yelp review, so something that forces you to move slow.  The atmosphere supports that.  "
,,,,,"They have an order of things, they have an order for each step of making a drink, and I watch as them almost instinctually, naturally.  I love all things about this shop, the coffee is roasted perfectly, the quality is absolute, and if you want to try a better coffee, I think you should try."
,,,,,"The vanilla latte with their house made vanilla syrup paired with their coconut-cashew mylk is literally one of the best lattes e v e r. Not gonna lie though this place is pretty touristy, and their prices are up there but hey, you get a free mug on your first visit so it seems pretty worth it!!"
,,,,,"Also, there's tons of room to just chill, view the pike place scenery and drink and work. I can see myself here on any weekday!"
,,,,,"Ok I admit it - Storyville successfully lured me in, along with all the other tourists. "
,,,,,"If you didn't already know, this coffee shop offers free mugs to anyone who signs up for their email list. If that wasn't enough, they also give out free cups of coffee to those who buy a bag of their beans. I should've suspected that something was wrong when I looked at the prices of the drinks on their menu. $7 for a cold brew and an additional $1.50 for almond milk is steep for a regular-sized coffee. Because my drink would have come out to around $10, I justified buying a bag of their ""Prologue"" beans just to get the free drink. "
,,,,,"Clearly, this is their tactic because the coffee is NOT good. There was almost no flavor so now I'm stuck with beans that I'll probably never brew. But on the bright side, I did get a free mug... that I'll probably never use either. Nice!"
,,,,,It was super creamy and rich cause of the cashew milk. The coffee was wonderful. The service was slow but it's a coffee shop so I won't hold that against them.
,,,,,"The mocha here is divine. It tastes like rich hot chocolate, which at least in my book is a win. The drink tastes like the chocolate was melted on the spot (at least it tastes like the mocha from my now second-favorite cafe, which melts their chocolate on the spot.) 6/5 for the mocha "
,,,,,"The ambiance is great, if only a little crowded. Grab a seat by the bay windows if you can"
,,,,,"We tried a handful coffee shops during our Seattle visit and would have to say that Storyville was the absolute best. Not gonna lie, it's definitely pricey, but we loved it. This location is upstairs in one of the buildings at Pike Place Market. "
,,,,,"We ordered both a hot and cold mocha with almond milk and it was DELICIOUS, unlike any other I've had in the past. I wish I could make this from my home because I would have it everyday."
,,,,,"As of May 2021, they were giving out free Storyville mugs ($15 retail value) if you signup for their online mailing list. A pretty generous offer imo. "
,,,,,"Highly recommend this place, even despite the line. Can't wait to go back."
,,,,,If you're a first time customer like I was you are going to fall in love! It was hard to find in pike place but well worth the adventure! It's on the 3rd floor by the corner of Pike Pl and Pike St. While you wait in line there's a QR code you can scan for a free mug for first time customers! The mug is so artsy and great quality!  If you purchase a bag of coffee your drink is also free! I was amazed at all the freebies they were giving. The quality of espresso was great and their house made syrups were not overly sweet like most places. There were only two baristas working through a long line but they were working very hard and in great spirits. Thank you Storyville for a great experience and some great souvenirs!
,,,,,Free mug if you sign up! 
,,,,,Me and my friend got lost trying to find this cafe haha
,,,,,You have to go up some stairs inside the building so you wont see it from outside. 
,,,,,"Love the interior, the vibe, the merch, the people and especially the coffee! "
,,,,,I bought a bag of their beans but i regret not buying two and had to sadly come back to Texas with one:( 
,,,,,"Even though they get really busy and there might be a big line, the baristas are really good at working quickly to get your to you. "
,,,,,I wish I lived in seattle to have all these wonderful cafes to try 
,,,,,anyways highly recommend!
,,,,,Hiding upstairs on a second floor
,,,,,Typical old seattle style
,,,,,You can not find anything easily 
,,,,,The staff here are really holding positive energy and really happy. The view is nice with fairly quite a few seats. Not crowded on a work day morning
,,,,,Will come back soon. Coffee is good but pricy.
,,,,,You can't judge since they give a first time come in people a free mug
,,,,,"This space is comfortable and it's in a great location, there's a decent amount of seating and they make a ton of stuff in-house (alternative milk, syrups, baked goods etc.). That said, I paid $9.65 for a 12oz. oatmilk latte today and I died a little inside. Was it good? Sure! Was it double what I'd normally pay for an oatmilk latte? You bet. Am I aware I'm paying for location, homemade oatmilk, and their own roast? Absolutely. Was it worth it? Nah. TLDR; super long wait, super high prices, average latte."

,,,,,This place is coffee magic. The streets below at Pike Place are packed with not many places to just sit. This upper story coffee shop has a calming vibe with good seating. All of the servers were super friendly.
,,,,,"Even though the coffee itself is expensive, you can sign up and get a free mug! If you get a bag of beans (which are awesome!) you get a free drink."
,,,,,I loved this place and we love our mugs and coffee beans as well that we brought home with us.
,,,,,"To me this is a true hidden gem - if you don't know about it, you're probably not going to find it by just exploring Pike Place so I'm lucky my friend knew about this place."
,,,,,We each got a latte and shared a frosted cinnamon roll.  The lattes were good and based on other reviews it sounds like that's what they're known for.  We waited a while and our cinnamon roll was never brought out to us while other people who came after us got theirs.  We followed up on it and it came shortly after.  They even gave us a $10 gift card for the small hiccup!  That was totally unexpected and much appreciated so that's what makes me want to give a 5 star rating.
,,,,,"Pro-tip: if you're a first time guest, scan the QR code near the front of the line for a free mug."
,,,,,"I can't rave about this place enough. This is such an ambient spot, though I admit that it was a bit hard to find and navigate to. The drinks are amazing, the service is beyond amazing, and just everything was perfect."
,,,,,"Their drinks really hit the spot, but most of all their croissant was the best. The first time we went, we ordered the croissants fresh out of the oven. We also ordered a cinnamon roll but they forgot to register that. When my partner told them, they gave us a cinnamon roll on the house for their mistake, which wasn't a big deal to us at all. The baristas were really nice, patient, and accomodating with any questions we had, which made the whole experience so much better. The napkins are also really nice and they give free mugs to first comers. I still use my mug today and it just brings back some great memories of the whole cafe and all."
,,,,,We liked it so much that we went the very next day (we only stayed two days in Seattle). That's how amazing it is! Definitely go if you're visiting since it's just amazing!
,,,,,A friend recommended we come here and so glad we took her advice. We got here about 20 minutes before they opened which was perfect timing to queue up and wait. 
,,,,,I opted for the chai oat milk latte and the hubs got an oat milk latte. We both ordered the breakfast sandwich with cheddar cheese; mine without bacon. 
,,,,,"It should be mentioned, they make everything in house, including the ""milks."" The chai was so good and one that I will wish I could have regularly when we are back home. "
,,,,,The breakfast sammie came out piping hot on bread that had little sprinkles of flaky sea salt on top paired with fluffy egg and delicious cheese. 
,,,,,Perfect way to start the day and the staff were so very friendly too.
,,,,,Love the vibe here! Decent coffee and I guess they sometimes (maybe all the time) give you a free cute little mug too lol!
,,,,,"When in Seattle, you expect good coffee. Despite being in a tourist area that is Pike Place Market, Storyville brews good coffee. My latte and my wife's decaf latte were balanced and smooth. "
,,,,,Kids get a free airplane-shaped sugar cookie turning our toddler into a Storyville brand advocate. 
,,,,,"Despite the long line, service ran fast and the staff were friendly. "
,,,,,"Inside, there's a large sitting area and a public bathroom is down the hall from the coffee shop."
,,,,,"If you're expecting a cute little Seattle cafe, go to another neighborhood- Capitol Hill, Ballard, Fremont, Columbia City, etc. Storyville feels more commercial, like a Starbucks Reserve. "
,,,,,"As you wait in line, scan the QR code on the signs. If you sign up for their newsletter, you'll get a free mug."
,,,,,"Alright prices here are just too exorbitant and inaccessible (latte is $7.50), but really it was worth it. The coffee is so smooth and nutty, not overly acidic. Really solid drinks, but just can't justify this being a perfect go-to coffee shop. Would recommend trying it out once for the cozy experience, with the location being on an upper story. You can get a seat next the window and stare out at various roofs of Pike Place buildings, and check out the view of Puget Sound. There is also a free mug for first-time customers!"
,,,,,"I cannot believe we waited in an long line for this! Not sure why there was such a long line as the coffee was just ok. Probably bc of the free item, which we weren't aware of but don't care for it. "
,,,,,"We came right at opening and there was already a line. Waited 30 minutes. 4 baristas working but 2 shadowing the main 2. So it went slow. We ordered the espresso shot and a chai latte. The espresso was ok, my husband said it wasn't smooth or had depth. My $6 chai latte tasted like an overly sweet chai from Starbucks. No spices, no chai taste. Probably came premade. Wasn't satisfied so we headed for another coffee shop. "
,,,,,Not sure how I feel about this place. Maybe their lattes are better? Or is it a touristy trap? Anchorhead is definitely our favorite!
,,,,,"This place exceeds my expectations. Traveling from LA to Seattle, I wanted to explore the coffee here. My boyfriend and I visited Storyville on a rainy day and it was the perfect start to our day. The line can get long but it's so worth it!! Once you step inside, you can feel the cozy ambiance with couches and lights. We ordered a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. Both were delightful and perfect for the weather. Customer service is excellent as well. We are definitely returning and putting this spot as one of our tops for coffee!"
,,,,,"Unless the objective is to get a free mug (which they give out on your first visit), I would probably pass on Storyville."
,,,,,"There was actually nothing wrong with how the coffee tasted. In fact, it was perfectly fine. However, I didn't think that the drinks here justified the long queue and the price point. I ordered the Cold Brew Latte with their homemade coconut-cashew mylk, and that came out to a crazy $8 before tax and tip."

,,,,,"The prices here literally made my eyeballs feel like they were about to pop out of their sockets lol $8 for a latte is asinine ... but I digress. Came here to get my afternoon coffee and begrudgingly handed over $6 for an Iced Americano. I did like their espresso and found it to be incredibly smooth and adequately strong, but I didn't taste anything incredibly magical in their drinks to counteract the bitter aftertaste of their menu prices. It's cool that they make their plant based milks in house; the soy latte tasted unique and creamy and I would be quite curious to try their other milks like almond milk."
,,,,,The vibes in here are nice and it's quite a large well decorated space to relax with friends when you need a break from walking around Pikes Place. You can also get a free mug if you sign up for their mailing list which I guess makes up for the higher price of a visit here if it's your first time :-)
,,,,,"It took us a while to find but it was so worth it! Storyville has the warmest ambience you could imagine on a drizzly January day in Seattle. Fireplace, beautiful decor, comfy seating, and great coffee. Everyone in our group loved their drink, whether they're big coffee drinkers or not. They also gave out a free mug to anyone who was visiting for the first time. It's upstairs above the shops at Pike and 1st. Even if you get lost like we did, it's worth the hunt!"
,,,,,"This Storyville location is special gem. The interior is nice, but if you're lucky to get a spot by the window, you'll have a beautiful view of Pike Place (just below) and the Puget Sound in the distance. "
,,,,,"The coffee is great, but you should anticipate a long line to get coffee and no guarantee of a place to sit. "
,,,,,Recommend!
,,,,,"Cozy coffee shop with views of Pike Place. Came here on a Saturday morning around 10:30 and there was a long line, but it moved at a relatively okay pace. There's indoor seating available (no outdoor). Credit cards are accepted. Go up the stairs to the third level to get to the entrance. You order at the counter, pay, and then they make your drinks right then and there. Light pastries are also available. "
,,,,,"If you provide your email address, you can get a free mug. They have self-service items like lids, napkins, etc to the right hand side of the entrance. There were a lot of people sitting down but we were able to grab a table, and then move to the counter seating by the window to get a nice view. It's more so a spot to hang out with friends rather than do work. We even saw someone bring their kitten into the cafe (the kitty was super cute) so it may be hard to focus (at least on weekends)."
,,,,,Should've listened to the reviewers who said the coffee isn't very good and you're lured in by the free mug and ambiance because it's so true!
,,,,,Paid almost $10 with tax for a vanilla latte and I couldn't taste the vanilla and barely tasted any espresso. It was basically warm milk.
,,,,,The ambiance inside is really nice but it was so crowded we didn't feel comfortable staying during Covid.
,,,,,The service here is great and is why I give it 3 stars instead of 1.
,,,,,I came here this past weekend for the famed cinnamon rolls and as expected encountered a big line. I was skeptical that they would live up to the hype but I'm so glad I waited. 
,,,,,"Buttery, sugary, flakey amazingness. Even better when served fresh out of their oven with the glaze. We ended up going home with 9 (ordered 10 but they ran out) and somehow only have one left (they're that good!) Expensive but worth every penny."
,,,,,"Was looking for a rest room around Pike Place and stumbled upon this shop. After the seeing the line figured we'd give it a go and enjoyed what I had. Went with the cold brew and chocolate chip cookie. Employees were very nice, store seemed super clean and had great views for the short wait for drink prep. Will definitely be back"
,,,,,"Starting off my review saying that I'm not a coffee expert, but I was here to show my friends a cool coffee shop! That said...Definitely super high end coffee shop, cute and cozy atmosphere. But a latte is $7.50 - although it was very smooth and had a slight chocolatey note. My friends were fans and said it was good coffee to splurge on. Boy was this place busy on a Sunday morning. "
,,,,,"I don't think this place used to be this pricey, but everything in here is super expensive now. French press is $4 but all other drinks are $5.50-$8. They are giving out free mugs to first time customers if you give them your email address..seems to be a way to get people to come in and buy stuff."
,,,,,My favorite coffee place in Seattle. We came here early morning before our flight back home. To our surprise they gave us free mugs  when we signed up for email list. So our whole group got free mugs that we use to this day. Their lattes were strong and delicious.
,,,,,"This place is adorable! The atmosphere is so cozy and welcoming. The staff is incredibly friendly. It was our first time in, so they gave us 2 coffee mugs for free. When we were sitting there someone came around and brought us water. The couches are comfy and the fireplace was perfect for a cold, rainy, day! I had a chai tea and my friend had an espresso both were delicious and hit the spot! I would definitely recommend coming in for the views, atmosphere, one of a kind staff, and delicious drinks!"

,,,,,We decided we absolutely had to stop here and try the Mac n cheese since we had heard great things about it before our Seattle trip. We came during the week around noon and it wasn't too crazy. There wasn't much room to grab a seat inside but there was no line to order. We both grabbed the small size Mac n cheese. 
,,,,,"Service was quick and friendly, and the Mac n cheese was good! It was rich but there was plenty of creamy sauce. We could have probably split a small since we just wanted a taste.. it's rich and filling but definitely worth it. "
,,,,,I'd return to try their grilled cheese or some other items. Cute shop.
,,,,,"The visit starts with a free sample of their well-known Flagship cheese. It's the perfect way to showcase their cheese because after that, I was much more convinced that they'd be pumping out good food. "
,,,,,"The Grilled cheese was cheesy, but not as gooey as I was hoping. The cheese had a good flavor but the bread just wasn't the right bread to showcase the sandwich. I'm no bread expert so I can't say which bread would have paired well, but it wasn't this. "
,,,,,The Mac n cheese stayed creamy and cheesy throughout the whole time I sat and people watched around Pike Place. It didn't dry up like many Mac n cheeses so def a plus for that! It was also a great flavored dish and each piece of pasta was fully coated in cheesy goodness. 
,,,,,They're def quick and efficient so don't be discouraged by that long line. I started at the street intersection but literally was in line for maybe 10-15 minutes. The grilled cheese does take longer just because it's made to order but the Mac n cheese is scooped out pretty quickly.
,,,,,This place was so good that I had to come back TWICE! It was super cool seeing the cheese being made. I got the kimchi grilled cheese and it was super unique and had a zing to it. The Mac and cheese is also a must!! You have to try this place out when in Seattle I promise you will not regret it!
,,,,,"If you like cheese, check out this place! They had 3 samples at the self-serve queue: Flagship, curds and Marco Polo (with cracked green and black peppercorns). All so good!!!"
,,,,,"From the window you can see the milk/cream getting churned in one vat, and the curds in another vat. Pretty cool. "
,,,,,We just had lunch when we went to this place and couldn't resist getting a small cup of their Mac and Cheese. So creamy!!!! 
,,,,,We also bought some Flagship cheese and took it home at at our Airbnb so we could eat before dinner with crackers and wine.
,,,,,"It was okay. I feel like yeah get a Mac n cheese to try it for the hype but then again it wasn't worth the hype. I love Mac n cheese, but this just wasn't it! I feel like they were basically trying to flex that their cheese was that bitch but you're better off just buying their cheese and making your own Mac n cheese at home. But the people working the day I went were super nice :) I just don't think the Mac n cheese to worth buying. It just really wasn't anything special to me."
,,,,,I love Mac and cheese. And this. This is the place. 
,,,,,"Ordered a large (16oz I believe), and was tempted to go back and order more."
,,,,,"I also tried their Smoked Turkey sandwich, and lemme tell you, it's such a great combo."
,,,,,"Coming to Seattle for the first time, Beecher's was high up on the list of places to try. We came on a Sunday right before noon and luckily didn't encounter any long lines or large crowds. The staff was very friendly and we were in & out in no time. I ordered the smoked salmon & dill mac & cheese and it was delicious! My friend ordered the ""World's Best"" Mac & cheese and she couldn't get enough of it either. We instantly regretted getting the 8 oz portion after the first bite but we have to leave room for out Pike Place exploration."
,,,,,"TLDR; cheese shop that also sells mac n cheese and grilled cheese. There's two lines inside, one for the cafe and one if you only want to buy cheese. "
,,,,,"Beecher's is a must for anyone visiting Seattle. There's a good reason why the lines usually are out the building and wraps around it. But don't be deterred by it, the lines move pretty fast. While you're waiting in line, you can see through the windows the whole process on how they make their cheese. Inside the building, there are placards too, detailing the process even more. "
,,,,,"If you're there just to buy cheese, you can wait in the smaller line inside the building. Next to that counter, there are also free samples of their cheese. "
,,,,,"We ordered the 16 oz. Mac & Cheese to share between the 5 of us. If you're lactose intolerant, take your lactaid pill or else you'll probably die from the cheesiness. It's so good though, and we even went back for a second round later in the day. They're constantly making the mac n cheese so if you're just ordering that, you don't have to wait long but the grilled cheese will take a bit of time. "
,,,,,"There are multiple locations as well so if you don't want to deal with the crowds, I'd recommend checking those out. Pike Place location will probably be the busiest considering how much of a tourist attraction its become."
,,,,,Cheese cheese cheesy cheese....
,,,,,"I'm lactose intolerant but I can't seem to stay away from cheese. Strangely, I didn't get the usually upset stomach,  painful cramps and all the other painful symptoms that I usually get after eating cheese. I even asked her to top my mac n cheese with freshly grated parmesan cheese. I couldn't even stay away from the free variety of cheese samplers. "
,,,,,One of the best mac n cheese I have ever had.
,,,,,Pain free too lol!
,,,,,"Their cheese is pretty darn good, and it's just fun to watch them make it.  This is the first time I've actually stopped in to try anything and I thought it was ok.  Had to try out their mac and cheese and I guess I was a little underwhelmed.  It's ok, and the cheese has a good flavor, but I didn't think it really stood out all that much from others.  Except that they don't use macaroni, but that's a bit of a stretch.  The line moves relatively quick, but that's an expensive little cup for a snack.  Probably worth trying other things on the menu next time around."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I used to love, love, love this place. Stopped in for lunch today, hoping to get a bowl of the French onion soup. Sadly they no longer serve it. So I ordered the Mac and cheese and a breadtzle. I know, I know, too many carbs, but hey it's Covid and I need comfort food to deal with my anxiety. "
,,,,,"The Mac was amazing, better than I remembered. The Breadtzle should be avoided at all cost. Unless, that is you enjoy chewing on saw dust coated in oil. It was quite an unpleasant experience, it was almost as if it needed a savory broth to dip it in. Maybe say, SOME EFFING FRENCH ONION SOUP!! "
,,,,,"Please Beechers, please bring back the French onion soup. If not at least get rid of the sawdust cake Breadtzle. "
,,,,,"I'll be back for my cheese curds and Mac, but every disappointed that the FRO is gone."
,,,,,Went here to grab a quick snack.  Delicious cheese in the grilled cheese sandwich. Service slow but sandwich was hot. Friendly staff.
,,,,,"I think the Mac and Cheese here is whatever, but I'll give it an extra star since they used to give out samples and you can watch them make cheese."
,,,,,"If you want fresh mac n' cheese in The Market, this is the place! Had better but the freshness is something you can't find everywhere! They make it through a glass window and the line itself was only about 5 min long"
,,,,,"Pretty damn good, but not necessarily as good a homemade.  Almost too cheesy.  Pricey, but so is Seattle."
,,,,,Saw a huge line for this place and as a cheese lover HAD to wait in line. The line was fairly fast considering it wrapped all around the store outside. We probably waited like 15-20 minutes. 
,,,,,I ordered the classic grilled cheese (~$9) and it took about 15 minutes to make (I had a lot of cheese samples while waiting). It was super super cheesy and decadent. The bread wasn't anything special. I definitely was full for hours after that sandwich. 
,,,,,"My friends also got the classic mac and cheese, which they said was also super good, and so so much cheese. "
,,,,,"Overall, it was pretty good, but definitely waaaay too rich for my palate. Probably would have been better off sharing because it was pretty dense, but definitely some good cheese!"
,,,,,YUM!
,,,,,"Beecher's is one of the must-try spots in the heart of Pike Place. It features a slim menu, but one with options that will not disappoint. You have to get the mac and cheese here, either:"
,,,,,- Original: comes with the Beecher's original cheese and suggest this for first timers.
,,,,,"- Mariachi: comes packed with a little bit of spice, also peppers n onions (I actually like this one more!)"
,,,,,They also have a delicious cheddar bread that can be heated and enjoyed. I actually scooped one of these up early in the morning for breakfast.
,,,,,BTW: they got free cheese curd samples in t
,,,,,"Wtf really.  Hyped place. No shit, nothing is handmade. Blatant lie. The cheese is also not that amazing. It's okaaay. Their grilled cheese sandwich is not world famous. It's Seattle hyped at the max. Its meh."
,,,,,If Oprah claims it's the best how can we not try this place? 
,,,,,"An entire store dedicated to (cue spotlight) artisan CHEESE and all the goodies you can make with it!  Mac n CHEESE, grilled CHEESE, CHEESE chips/crackers, CHEESE wedges, wheels...you get the picture?"
,,,,,"Oprah didn't lie. And despite Beecher's making Oprah's favorite things in 2013 - this bit of clout holds true seven years later. The smooth, creamy, balance between the butter, cheese, bit of bitter and sweetness with the perfectly made penne make this Mac n cheese my favorite too. "
,,,,,This location is super busy but well worth the wait if you're intent on your famous Mac n cheese.
,,,,,1/2020
,,,,,A great stop when at Pike Place Market! Head to the back of the store to peruse retail and get a sample of the cheese.
,,,,,Then get in line and order the Mac and cheese! I went with a friend so we got a small order of the original and the flagship. The flagship is a bit spicier with vegetables. The original is the ooey gooey cheesy deliciousness you expect. It's definitely very rich!
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Cheese. Cheese.  And more cheese.  You had me at cheese :)  Located across from Pike Place Market, this place is a delicious gold mine."
,,,,,"It's small, but packs a mighty punch!  The front part of the store is where you can order food (ie - various types of grilled cheese sandwiches).  I ordered the classic one - with basil and tomato.  Of course they use their own homemade fresh cheese.  The bread is perfectly golden brown toasted, the cheese is melted to pure perfection and it is a harmony of biblical....well you get the drift :)  For $8.99..not bad at all.  They also have mac/cheese and a few soup options if you want to round out your meal."
,,,,,"Depending on timing, the front has a glass partition where you can watch them making their cheese.  There are a few stools here to sit and enjoy your grilled goodness."
,,,,,Towards the back of the store you can buy their cheeses.   
,,,,,"All the staff are super friendly here, which is saying a lot b/c it can get super busy!  Luckily no line when we went (most likely bc we went just before closing..which I believe is like 7 or 8pm)"
,,,,,"Hahaha - I once posted a poll on my IG food blog asking my audience if they liked their Mac n Cheese or their Sandwich more. There was a solid show of support for the Mac n Cheese - so there you go. I, on the other hand, love their sandwiches. The Chicken Arugula Mama's Lil Peppers is awesome! This is definitely a queue worth investing your time in. They also sell their signature cheese curds if you'd like to take some home."
,,,,,Line out the door on Thursday 12PM but moves very quickly. I had to wait about 10 minutes total to get my food.
,,,,,"The 8 oz. World's best mac and cheese was a guilty delight. It was also very heavy for such a small portion. It was creamy, warm, and like a cheesy soup smoothie. The noodles were soft and mushy."
,,,,,There are several cheese samples to try while you wait. They were all very good.
,,,,,"Beecher's is definitely an iconic spot in Seattle's Pikes Place. My friends and I came around noon and the line wasn't super long, but it was starting to snake out to the corner. The line took maybe like 10-15 minutes, a LOT faster than we had anticipated. The process of ordering and getting food was super fast. To order cheese, there's another register at the back. It was about $12 for a large mac and cheese. "
,,,,,"We only ordered one large mac and cheese to share among the three of us. It was so good. They use penne pasta and the cheese was super creamy and thick. The mac and cheese was not watery at all. Because of the cheese, it is a pretty heavy meal. However, we were all really content with the amount. It was also cool to watch them make the cheese on the other side of the glass. They do have a few chairs, but definitely not for a big group to hang out. "
,,,,,I would recommend to share a large mac and cheese with friends. They also have a spicy mac and cheese as well as sandwich options. I would definitely recommend this place to friends visiting Seattle!
,,,,,Yum! Check out their samples -- so tasty. 
,,,,,"Also if you are around, you could check out how they actually make cheese which is super fun especially for kids! Definitely a fun and tasty place"
,,,,,We tried their original mac and cheese after seeing it in a vlog. On its own it's a bit overwhelming but the flavor is really good. Next time I'd probably get a smaller container or eat is as a side with a meal.
,,,,,"So....I hate to be this guy, but I thought Beecher's was OK. Not bad. Not terrible, but not up to the level of hype surrounding this place. Mac and cheese? OK. Grilled cheese sandwich? OK. The one real point of contention for me was the cheese curds. These were just not good. Dry and rather bland. I'm from the Midwest and I've had some cheese curds that will make your socks roll up and down. These were not it. "
,,,,,"That being said, everything else was cool - great service, hip vibe, etc. I'm glad we visited, but I don't think we'll be back."
,,,,,First time in Seattle so I HAD to try this hyped up spot during my trip. Definitely worth the wait and hype as this is the best Mac and Cheese spot I've ever had! The cheese was so flavorful and the macaroni was cooked perfectly. The Smoked Salmon had so much smokey flavor in every single bite. A solid 5/5. Their OG mac was also a solid 4.5/5. 10/10 would recommend this spot if you are a cheese lover!
,,,,,The cheese is out of this world. We got the regular Mac and cheese and wow. It was so so delicious. 
,,,,,Going back for more Mac and cheese to take home. Haha. 
,,,,,H
,,,,,Enjoy.
,,,,,"The hype is alive and real! Most definitely the most gooey and cheesy mac & cheese I've had. It came piping hot, which makes it even more better. The grilled cheese is also to die for. The line always looks long, but moves pretty quicky. As a mac & cheese lover this place gets my stamp of approval!"
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Worth the hype! This place is a like place classic for a reason! The Mac and cheese was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. It was full of so much flavor and was a unique blend of cheeses. It had a really nice sharp taste to it but was still smooth and creamy in texture. It was really cool to see the cheese being made as well. This is definitely a mist visit if you are ever at pike place market, especially the Mac and cheese but even just to stop by and see the cheese being made is cool if you don't have time for a bite."
,,,,,"Just ok. People really rave about the cheese but it was kind of like (to put it in crude, slightly sacrilege terms) mixing Alfredo sauce with pasta. "
,,,,,"It's creamier than regular Mac and cheese, but I was hoping for something more distinctly sharp or nutty about this cheese."
,,,,,The signature sandwich was really good and cheesy. Would definitely eat here more often if I still live dim the area
,,,,,"I love Beecher's. Their grilled sandwiches with a side of tomato soup is my go-to (and when I want to indulge, I'll get the mac & cheese!). I also tried their lasagna and not as good compared to the other items, but it's a tough to beat the classics!"
,,,,,"Awesome spot for mac and cheese. Went here 3 times during my week in Seattle, no complaints, always consistent. Check it out!"
,,,,,"Woah, talk about the absolute best Mac and Cheese I've ever had in my 30 years of living on this earth! "
,,,,,"Amongst the busy streets and crowds, you cannot miss the wonderful scent in the air of cheese! This place is right on Pike Street and the lines speak for themselves. It is definitely worth it, so worth it that I will say you have to try this Mac and Cheese before departing this earth....ok I'm exaggerating but you will thank me for hyping this up."
,,,,,"According to one of the locals I spoke to, the line is always out the door which makes sense! Once you are inside, you order and then free to roam around the store while you wait for your name to be called. There are so many cheeses to choose from, it's crazy! Considering this was my first time here, I went for the Original Mac and Cheese and everything about that little cup of Mac and Cheese made me smile from ear to ear! It was perhaps the creamiest, richest, and most delectable Mac and Cheese ever! The pasta they used is penne and it is cooked to perfection. Honestly Beecher's, what are you doing to humanity by not sharing this goodness with everyone and keeping your locations only in Seattle and New York? "
,,,,,"If I'm ever in the Seattle area again, I am definitely having Beecher's but next time....I won't be sharing!"
,,,,,For cheese lovers and even those that don't. You can't go wrong with at least trying the mac & cheese here at Beecher's. Has the perfect combination of cheesyness to the pasta. The have a variety of other items as well. 
,,,,,"Located in Pike Place Market. There's usually a line out the door and not much seating room if you're looking for a place to down your food. In addition, they have a cheese section in the back of the store (with samples), so if you're just looking for cheese typically you can just avoid the line and head towards to back. The staff moves quickly here and were super nice and friendly. "
,,,,,"Overall, it's a good experience to try out Beecher's and get the Mac and Cheese."
,,,,,Amazingly great mac n cheese! Definitely get the salmon mac n cheese! They also carry a variety of cheeses. I especially enjoyed the Oaxaca cheese when I made birria tacos. Also you can watch them make their famous cheese curds!
,,,,,Hmmm not quite sure I get the hype but maybe it's because I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan to begin with.
,,,,,"The line was really long but moved pretty quickly. I got a small cup of their ""World's Best"" mac & cheese. I appreciate it's made of real milk but it was too salty for me. Glad I didn't get a bigger cup. I tried my friend's ""Mariachi"" mac & cheese and it definitely had more depth in flavor (but wasn't spicy)."
,,,,,"Also, there is virtually 0 seating except for a small strip of counter space."
,,,,,One and done deal. Not sure I'd be back.
,,,,,I've been coming here for years and absolutely love love love the homemade cheese here. I shared the mac & cheese experience with my partner which isn't a fan of anything mac & cheese. I told her to be open to the experience and I must've met we ate there three times over our three day trip lol. It's right in front of the Pike Street market place in super easy to navigate in and out of.
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,The Mac and cheese was delicious and worth it! The grilled cheese sandwich tasted good but wasn't that remarkable and was very small considering the price they charge for it.
,,,,,"If you are visiting Pike Place Market, stopping at Beecher's for a midday snack, lunch or dinner is a no brainer. If you see a long line, don't let it deter you from hopping in it! It moved pretty fast and the delicious Mac and cheese or grilled cheese is worth it! If you are with someone else, order both and split the food and I can guarantee you will be full the rest of the day! "
,,,,,"If you don't have enough time to wait in line, at least stop in and try their free samples of cheese in the back of the shop. It is too delicious to pass up and WELL worth the calories (you walk them off on those Seattle hills anyway, right )"
,,,,,"This place was recommended to visit when in Seattle. After our original plan didn't work and we were hungry, this place wasn't too busy when walking by so we decided to go in. "
,,,,,"We tried the classic Mac n cheese, the mariachi Mac n cheese and a grilled cheese. Okay so I looooove cheese, but this place did nothing for me. The Mac n cheese was good, but tasted more like an Alfredo sauce than cheesy goodness. We weren't impressed with anything we got."
,,,,,"There's a few stools to sit at facing where they make the cheese, but good luck getting a seat. It was also unorganized inside. There were 2 lines, but they weren't identified well. We were standing in the line to get cheese products instead of food but it was just a big cluster of people in there."
,,,,,"The hype is real! Beecher's ""world-famous"" mac and cheese is killer. I waited in line for no more than 5-10 minutes on a Sunday. When we made it inside, the service was lightning quick. The food is warm and, needless to say, divine. It is penne pasta with a creamy cheese sauce and bits of red pepper in it. I ordered one 16 oz. bowl to share with my boyfriend. After trying it, we realized that we made a mistake, and we should have got more. This is the only mac and cheese (and meal, for that matter) that my boyfriend could not stop talking about during our trip. We are considering ordering some to be shipped to our door. It is just that good. 10/10!"
,,,,,Oh I absolutely love this place! It's so fun to watch and learn about how the Flagship cheese is made here. I also enjoy eating all the little samples they have to offer while waiting in line to order. 
,,,,,Recently tried their cheese crackers as a sample and I could stand there all day and eat those.. but really it's all about the famous Beechers Mac and Cheese. The. Best. Mac And Cheese. The pasta they use with the amazing savory sauce is just perfection! 
,,,,,I also love getting the grilled cheese with tomato soup! I used to nanny for a kid that loved this for lunch so we'd get it once a week - it's addicting! 
,,,,,This is quality cheese and worth the hype and money in my opinion. It's a must try and see when you're exploring Pike Place.
,,,,,"I don't like Mac and cheese but this is the exception. It's pretty rich, so that could be a pro or con for people. Beecher's is a must stop when visiting Seattle, it's a staple. And the cheese curds are a great snack."
,,,,,"So turns out that all the hype really is for a reason - the mac n cheese was delicious. And unique. $6.50 for a small, which is big enough to share with a friend if you're snacking around the market. There was definitely a line, but it went fast. My recommendation? Send your friend to nearby Piroshky Piroshky to wait in that line while you wait in the Beecher's line (or vice versa), and then share. "
,,,,,Don't forget to go to the back of the shop for a cheese sample.
,,,,,"This line is out the door for a reason. Hands down the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. While waiting, you can watch them make cheese.  The grilled cheese was good and had decent flavor with a mix of their cheeses. Nice quick snack or meal while at the market."
,,,,,"I came off a 7 night cruise with non stop eating. So I was not extremely hungry, but knew I had to try the famous Beecher's grilled cheese sandwich. I love grilled cheese. The bread was nothing special. The cheese was fantastic!! They use their flagship cheese between the bread. We sat and watched the lady who worked there make the flagship cheese in a huge container. There are absolutely no fillers here. No junk. They just use whole ingredients. "
,,,,,"The lines can get very long here but luckily we arrived early. This place is an institution. My daughter ordered the Mac and cheese. I had some of it and liked it, but it is extremely rich. It is very tasty, but a couple bites was all I could eat."
,,,,,They have an abundance of samples of two types of cheese. Take a guess. Their flagship cheese and fresh curds. Both are delicious. They also gave samples of their original crackers and cheddar ones. I thought the original ones were too plain and the cheddar ones were just okay. They also sell soups and salads. This is an interesting stop if you are in this area. It is right across from Pike Public Market.
,,,,,I love cheese .. I love food. . but I love cheese LOL 
,,,,,"When coming to Seattle, everyone says that you HAVE to go to Beecher's Handmade Cheese. So what did I have for dinner the first night I came? BEECHER'S. Listen to the people because this time, they were RIGHT. "
,,,,,"Beecher's does live up to the hype. The taste of FRESH cheese is very different than what we get in the store. I mean hello, they're making it RIGHT in front of you. They start with fresh, pure local milk. Then work with talented cheesemakers who apply traditional cheesemaking methods. They don't use anything artificial...ever. Located in the heart of Pike Place Market, you can't miss it! "
,,,,,"They provide little samples so you can taste a cerd before you actually buy it. I got kinda cheese happy and ended up telling the lady I wanted a 16oz cup LOL. Then I realized how big it was and I asked for an 8oz. Let's be real. I could have finished it. However, did I want to be STUCK and hurt from being full of good cheese? "
,,,,,"I love how they offer sandwiches or just basic maccheese for your togo meal. I ended up getting what they were known for, the ""World's Best"" . It was good and creamy. It also had that ""you know this is fresh"" grainy taste which I was okay with."
,,,,,I also ended up coming the next day during a food tour that I did. I ended up tasting the older cheese on a cracker and .. wow. . let's talk about life changing. The combination of aged cheese and the cracker was. . it.

,,,,,"Even though Beecher's is on the tourist strip, it is still so worth it! I came here everytime i visited Seattle and it never gets old. The super cheese cheddar is so rich and creamy. I wish i could bring it back to SF! I highly recommend their mac and cheese and you can share with your family since one bowl goes a long way!"
,,,,,"Mac & Cheese is not necessarily my go-to food when I see it on the menu but it's pretty well known in Seattle so on to my food list it goes. Generally the line isn't too long? And even if it was, it goes by fairly quick. Very simple, you just order what you want at the counter and wait for your name to be called. We shared a small Original Mac & Cheese and wow, it was so creamy. It didn't feel as heavy as you expected like your typical cheddar or swiss. It had a different taste than what I'm used to but I like it better than the typical mac & cheese. If only there was an option to add toppings like some bacon or vegetables then I would of been more than satisfied. In case you didn't get to try Beecher's in Pike's, I noticed that they have a shop at the airport as well! They pretty much sell the same thing on their menu so you can get your mac & cheese fix right before you fly"
,,,,,We had Mac & cheese and tuna melt! And we love it! The mac & cheese is creamy and not overcooked! Tuna melt have the good balance of tuna and cheese really tasty! Something that I would buy again for sure!
,,,,,"Like most businesses Beecher's has adopted a fantastic preorder takeout for a curb side contactless pickup order process. Customer service was perfect, and the order was ready at the very minute of my pickup time. The menu is short and sweet which is an indication of the time spent to ensure what's offered is filled with quality ingredients. Our grilled cheese, tomato soup, and mac & cheese was PHENOMENAL. Anytime you're close to Beecher's do yourself a favor, place an order to experience what cheese is suppose to taste like. We will return and highly recommend!!"
,,,,,One of our favorite places we tried in Seattle! A must visit at the Pike Place Market. Their cheese is to die for! We tried the Mac and cheese here and it was on point! Their signature Flagship cheese was soooo delicious! Seattle's pride and joy hahaha
,,,,,Venture to the back of the store and they have souvenirs for sale! Also they sell their handmade cheeses and have cheese samples near the back! 
,,,,,On the outside you can also see the works of cheese being made from the giant display window :) impossible to miss since there is a crowd peering in~
,,,,,"The ""World Famous Mac"" is a best seller at Beecher's and I couldn't understand why. For $6, you get a small cup of mac and cheese that is overcooked with a grainy texture. Yes, the cheese sauce is very generous, but the mac and cheese texture and taste that I was looking was not there. "
,,,,,I was looking for the kind of gooey stringy cheese that you get when you pull apart the perfect grilled cheese or take a bite out of a delicious New York style pizza. I was also looking for a more sharp taste from the cheese. Not found. 
,,,,,It's not too pricey if you want to give it a try for yourself and it can be comforting on a cold wet day. Beecher's also has delicious Cheddar and cheese curd samples for you to try on your next visit.
,,,,,The Cheese Curds are amazing and are handmade there. Don't uh follow on this thing though I just wanted to rate it. Damn their cheese is good
,,,,,I am a huge cheese lover and this place fulfills all of my cheese dreams and more! 
,,,,,"Their Mac and Cheese is SOOOO creamy and rich so if you're a cheese lover like me, I highly recommend you try this!"
,,,,,"Very popular cheese place in Seattle, worth a try if you're visiting, you can't go wrong with the mac n cheese!"
,,,,,"There's usually a line but not too long as others are filled quickly. Prices are also a bit high but expected for famous food in Pike's Place. The mac n cheese is sharp, gooey and delicious. Not much else to say, but that it'sunique and quality made. "
,,,,,Try them out!
,,,,,"Came by while walking around Pike Place Market, thankfully the line wasn't too long. Its interesting to be able to watch them make the cheese through the glass window. There's two lines, one for the cheeses itself, and one of their deli/hot food items like the mac n cheese. Go inside for the cheese line. "
,,,,,"The mac n cheese was pretty good, thick and sharp cheese flavor, with regular pasta noodles. A bit on the pricier side, but worth it as a tourist spot. We didn't buy any cheeses to go, but I hear those are pretty good too. They have a long counter for you to sit at if you're lucky enough to snag a spot (faces their cheese factory)."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"All in all, worth a try when you're visiting the Market, but not necessary if you aren't a big cheese fan."
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Sooo good! It was so cool because there's a window where you can watch them make the cheese! The service was also extremely fast despite the long line.This is a MUST if you're going to Seattle/ Public Place Market!
,,,,,Cheese lover heaven!!! I was lucky today was national grilled cheese day and the special was a Mac and cheese grilled cheese. Best grilled cheese I've ever eaten!! They should seriously add this to the main menu.
,,,,,"I love Beecher's cheeses and their Mac n Cheese. When visiting Pike Place Market, we always stop by Beecher's. This time, we picked up some tubs of cheese curds, Flagship (robust, nutty flavor), Dutch Hollow Dulcet (tangy and rich) and my favorite, SheepSheep (100% sheep's milk with that hint of fruit and butterscotch) to take home. Staff are always friendly and accommodating."
,,,,,"Say Cheese! A snack from this creamery is a must. Love Mac & Cheese? Each bite of this dish was scrumptious. Don't fret the line, the wait was well worth it. You'll pass the time marveling at the cheese melting in that huge tub."
,,,,,"I love cheese. I had high expectations for the Beecher's famous Mac n cheese. It had a kick to it, and it was great and cheesy and the noodles were pene. I loved it. I craved it weeks later and wish I was able to eat more. "
,,,,,"I think the line most be generally long, I was there on a Thursday evening and I even got to sit in front of the window where you can watch them make the cheese. "
,,,,,"Free samples of GOOD cheese curds too. They squeaked in the mouth, aka they are the real deal."
,,,,,My star rating:
,,,,,5  - I would be a regular customer 
,,,,,4 - would go back again
,,,,,3  - probably try a different place
,,,,,2  - not very satisfied
,,,,,1  - turnaround and run
,,,,,Worth. The. Wait. Some of the best and most cheesy Mac and cheese we've ever had!!!!  I wish I could eat here every day.
,,,,,The long line is worth it! I got a turkey sandwich and ate while watching them make the homemade cheese curds! I highly recommend trying to dine in sit at the window bar top. A pike place staple - 100% recommend coming here if you are visiting
,,,,,"The Mac and cheese was truly something to write home about! Highly recommend. There wasn't much of a line either, which was very nice. We will be coming back here for sure!"
,,,,,Tried the worlds best Mac n cheese! It was delicious. They make the cheese there and it's good and thick. The cold weather is perfect for some warm mac n cheese. Thought might be a hype but it was worth it. Taste different than every one I have tried. Has spices and the cheese is delicious. Easy method due to covid. Comes packaged and easy to walk around and eat.
,,,,,"This place is usually pretty packed I think - it's a pretty big tourist attraction I believe, but when I went, the line wasn't that long, even though there were a lot of people inside. There isn't much indoor seating area, aside from limited barstools, and the actual place is pretty small, but the cheese and menu items are amazing. "
,,,,,"I ordered the mariachi mac & cheese, while my friend ordered the world's best. Both were pretty good & cheesy, and since it was in a small bowl, it was easy to walk around Pike Place and nearby areas and enjoy the food. While waiting for our food, there were also samples of their other cheeses, including signature cheese, on display, which I tried and was very impressed, especially with their cheese curd. "
,,,,,"Not only do they serve food items, they also have a variety of cheese (cream, greek, etc) that are for sale. Opposite of the place you order, you can see the cheese being churned and made, which I thought was pretty cool. If you're walking around Pike Place, this place is a must-try (at least once) for cheese lovers alike!"
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I enjoyed the cheese at Beecher's.  I asked to try the truffle varieties and I am glad I did. One of the truffle cheeses is very mild and I did not like it after I tried it. That's what makes Beecher's so great.  The sampling ensures that you are buying what you will love.  I wound up not buying any of the cheeses with truffle, instead opting for the Marco Polo with peppercorns, a nutty bold cheese, which is great with Goldfish and Skyflakes crackers.  I am glad that there is a Beecher's in NYC because I only had so much room in my luggage and the cheese is really good!"
,,,,,"I also bought a crab Mac and cheese a few days ago, but due to all the food I had, forgot about it in the fridge in the hotel.  I took it back with me and reheated it in the oven at home today.  Still delicious!  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the shrimp and crab I bought and kept in the hotel fridge.  I dumped the shellfish after a few days and did not bring it back.  Cheese is a better souvenir to bring home!"
,,,,,"Recommended by a friend to try, as it's considered a Seattle staple. It didn't disappoint. Purchased the small smoked salmon mac n cheese for $9. There was a good amount of salmon in the mac n cheese. Loved the serving amount as well. The dish is not baked, just an FYI for those who might prefer baked mac n cheese."
,,,,,Ok yeah. I get why it's so popular now. I've been meaning to try Beecher's mac n cheese for so long; I finally got around to it and was not disappointed.
,,,,,"I split one order of the World's Best Mac with a few friends and that was honestly enough just because of how rich and dense it was (and also because I was trying to get food from other places lol). I'm not a HUGE fan of cheese -- I'll appreciate it but I won't crave it out of nowhere -- but Beecher's mac n cheese was definitely one of the best I've ever had. There was so much more flavor than simply cheese, and the depth of the flavor made it so much more enjoyable. I originally thought the smoked salmon mac n cheese would be weird, but after trying the World's Best and getting a taste of how much is going on in it, I can totally see how smoked salmon would pair well with it. I'm imagining something like lox-flavored cream cheese."
,,,,,"I'll definitely be back for more mac n cheese, and I'll get around to trying the smoked salmon one hehe"
,,,,,"an incredible, creamy mac & cheese (& the cheese vat in the front is literally mesmerizing) ]. is the copious amount of cheese and cream worth the toll on my lactose-intolerant body? yes!"
,,,,,"i got their best mac & cheese ($8) and i'd say while it's excellent, it's a snack at best."
,,,,,staff: incredibly kind!
,,,,,sustainability tip: bring your own utensils :)
,,,,,parking: the roads above pike have parking for 0.25 along the street.
,,,,,"Ordered the famous Mac and cheese and lobster Mac and cheese. Disappointed in the flavors, I expected it to be more in depth. Wouldn't try it again."
,,,,,"We  had  the lasagna, and the original mac n cheese. The girl's 12 & 8yrs didn't care for the mac &cheese but the sure ate all my lasagna. It was super good went back for seconds"
,,,,,"Not sure why there's always a line here, but I only came for the mac n cheese and it did not meet my expectations.  The cheese had this powdery taste to it, which is weird considering that it's supposed to be fresh cheese."
,,,,,The 8oz is a bit pricey at $6.49 and it's not even full service.
,,,,,Mark it off my check box for Seattle and won't need to come back here.  Don't believe the hype..
,,,,,This is the best Mac and cheese I have ever had!! We were just getting some for fun and as a snack but ended up going back because it was so good! Worth the wait and had the perfect amount of cheese. Perfect for a Seattle day!
,,,,,You know a place is good when all the locals recommend it. I had the opportunity to visit Beecher's on my Seattle trip and I'm so glad I got to experience it. There's so many places to try at Pike Place but this is a must! They're not kidding when they say it's the world's best Mac n cheese. 
,,,,,"I loved how there was a small/large size option so you don't have to stuff yourself with one thing while you're at Pike. Next to the cheese displays, you can see them making fresh cheese in their manufacturing kitchen. As with every place at Pike, the line can get long but they move pretty fast. Even though they are known for their cheese, I was very impressed with their pasta too. Not too hard, not too mushy, just perfectly soft texture that paired so well with the rich cheese. Give them a visit if you're at Pike as it's a place that truly lives up to the hype!"
,,,,,"I understand the hype of the ""World Famous Mac & Cheese"". I really HATE cheese, especially mac & cheese. So we ordered the small World Famous Flagship Mac & Cheese, Tomato Soup & Breadzel to share. The line is long but it moves very quickly. It's hard to find a seat inside such a small store but just walk around!"
,,,,,"I wanted to give the mac & cheese a try so I could say that I've tried it but I really enjoyed it. This is the first mac & cheese ever that I have enjoyed/liked. It doesn't have the overwhelming cheese taste, just a good amount to get the taste. After having that cheese, I regret not trying the grilled cheese!! As a cheese hater, I'm so glad I gave this a try because this was really delicious."
,,,,,The breadzel is a must have as a side. It was so full of flavor and surprisingly soft!
,,,,,"I really disliked the tomato soup. This was a disappointment because I was expecting a creamy and smooth soup. Instead, it was a bit sour & just tasted like tomato water."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Oh my lanta. Cheese heaven. You must come here. Salmon mac and cheese 20/10. Worth the wait if there's a long line. Super friendly staff and fast service
,,,,,My husband and I went here twice during our trip in Seattle! We got the Mariachi Mac and World Famous Mac! We LOVEDDDDD the Mariachi Mac and wished we got a large! The Breadzel was really
,,,,,"Good too, we dipped the bread in the Mac sauce after  We came back a second time to order another Mariachi Mac before we head back home. "
,,,,,"They also sell the take-home kit. Now, I wish we bought it!"
,,,,,They're not lying. You can find AMAZING mac n cheese here. A must try if you're in Seattle.
,,,,,"Not sure what all the fuss is about. It was good Mac and Cheese, but over priced and under seasoned. Would not come here again."
,,,,,I am from the Midwest so when I saw cheese curds I had to buy some. We got the pepper ones. So good! The size is perfect to share with 2 or 3 people for a couple days.
,,,,,"(This review is from pre-COVID.) This place was recommended to us by a Seattle local as a must-try. And I thought Beecher's might be over-hyped but let me tell you, it was definitely worth the visit. We came around closing time and there was no wait! You walk in and on the right is a display of where they make the cheese. As you continue to walk around, they have samples of different types of cheese that you can purchase. However, we didn't buy any of their delicious cheeses just because we didn't know how it would travel."
,,,,,"The workers were friendly, accommodating and recommended their favorites. Prices are a bit high here but it's expected because of the location and how tourist-y it is. My sister and I only ordered their 8 oz. 'World's Best' to share. The mac and cheese here is thick, creamy, and so freaking good. It was the perfect size snack to have before dinner. We didn't have a problem finding some stools to sit on but I can tell that seating would be limited during the day. Overall, it was a pretty positive experience and we will definitely be back to try the grilled cheese!"
,,,,,"Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it's well-hyped. But man, it's hard to say this ISN'T the world's best Mac and cheese."
,,,,,"staff is super friendly!! every time i visit seattle this place is a must not only for the experience but also the quality. make sure to ask for samples of their hard cheeses: my favorite is the aged flagship (red label) & the flagship cheese stick (black label). Also don't forget to pick up the cheese curd trio -- mixed herbs, marinated peppers & original. mmm so GOOD! I've never have an issue bringing them through TSA either :)"
,,,,,Salmon Mac and cheese on the left. In my opinion it was just okay. Nothing special and we didn't finish it. The worlds best Mac and cheese on the right was better but nothing special. We will be back to try the grilled cheese and lasagna but the salmon Mac and wasn't doing it for us.
,,,,,"Everything was perfect. Quick Service, and COVID friendly. No seating but we had no problem eating on the a little dock area behind the market. The tomato soup was some of the best we have ever tasted. Mac and cheese was good to the last bite."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Such creamy and cheesy Mac and cheese! I've been here a few times and absolutely love the Mac and cheese each time I go. On a Saturday the line can get pretty long, but it moves fairly quickly. Last time I got the smoked salmon mac and cheese and I was surprised just how much salmon I got with my Mac and cheese! It's also pretty cool to see them making cheese while you're waiting in line. "
,,,,,This is definitely one of the must hit spots at Pike's Place!
,,,,,"Definitely stop by for some good cheese curds and try out the Mac N Cheese. The place is always busy and unless you are getting only the Mac N Cheese or something at the bar (soups), you will have to wait for a while to get your order ready. "
,,,,,Would recommend to-go and walk around and enjoy the delectable Mac N Cheese while it's still gooey and hot.
,,,,,"Their Mac n Cheese (amazing!!!), fresh cheese curds, and grilled cheese sandwiches are really yum! We were lucky to get there before the line started to wrap around the building. Admittedly, I'm not a big cheese fan... but I couldn't stop eating their stuff!"
,,,,,"This review is for their Max and Cheese. First of all, it was penne pasta and cheese. That large Mac and cheese set me back $12, but also oh so good! "
,,,,,"Pro Tip: if you want to take some Beecher's cheese home and you happen to be going through SeaTac airport, you'll be able to find them at the airport. We are planning to get some of their flagship cheese."
,,,,,This place is absolutely FANTASTIC !!!
,,,,,If you're a cheese lover you NEED to visit Beecher's.
,,,,,"Location is great, prices are about average for downtown Seattle.  The only negative ...... seating sucks, but if you can walk and eat it's not an issue whatsoever."
,,,,,"I throughly enjoyed my grilled cheese, and the free samples were an added bonus."
,,,,,Believe the hype. The Mac & Cheese is delicious.
,,,,,Staff taking great safety protocols as well due to COVID.
,,,,,Also get the bread!
,,,,,"I thought that the cheese would be more flavorful and creamy but the cheese sandwiches are very good, just could use a little more cheese is all."
,,,,,I loved it recommended the salmon with cheese bread together. I've always seen it on YouTube and on Instagram! If you go to Seattle it's a must go
,,,,,"Okay, I don't know if this is the /best/ mac 'n cheese I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. "
,,,,,"Located in Pike Place Market Beecher's Handmade Cheese is one of the go-to tourist destination spots in Seattle. Once you enter, there is a glass wall to the right beyond which you can observe the cheese making process. There is a small ledge to set your food on here and large ... milk jugs (I think) acting as stools where you can sit and watch the process while you eat. I imagine in the crowded times it wouldn't be too comfortable sitting here and trying to eat with people crowding around you though. "
,,,,,The counter behind which all the cheese is kept is to your left. This is where you try the mac 'n cheese - I had 'world's best'. It's got a bit of a kick to it; not spicy or anything just ... spiced. 
,,,,,There are also samples you can take home with you like boxes of cheese curds and such. I didn't purely because I'm not sure how well that would travel. 
,,,,,Definitely one of the touristy spots that's actually worth a drop-in and the wait.
,,,,,we got the mac and cheese! I think that the pasta was really overcooked and had been sitting in the pot for a pretty long time. The flavor was good and perfect but the texture of the sauce was really starchy because of how long it had been sitting inside the pot. maybe if we had gone a better time it would've been a lot better.

,,,,,"i loveeeeeee cheese so much. this is definitely my favorite place to go to at pike's place. their mac n cheese is so good, definitely the best!! depending on my cravings, i usually get mariachi since i like how it has a little kicked to it. but then my friend said i can mixed both. so now i will def be doing that since i wanna have the best, which is both of their mac n cheese! i have also tried their grilled cheese here and of course, delicious. "
,,,,,"i'm so happy they are also at the airport then i can buy the flagship cheese since it's a short fly home! also glad, they open one in nyc!!"
,,,,,i love beechers! please open one in the bay area!! :))))
,,,,,"So so so good! I tried the traditional mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. The mac and cheese was amazing! Everything is so fresh and hot when they give it to you, you can barely hold it. The line seems long but it moves pretty quickly. At least it did on a Friday morning. Highly recommend if you are in the pike place area!"
,,,,,Never heard of beechers but saw the line and said let's try this place and see what the possible hype is. The smoked salmon Mac and cheese is delicious!!!! Do not get the simple Mac and cheese. Get the salmon and you will not regret it one but. The flagship grilled cheese sandwich was very good and there was a lot of cheese present!!! Will say it was worth the wait as it did not disappoint one bit. If you visiting Seattle do not miss this place.
,,,,,The only place to go for really good cheese. They do have a self service area if you walk in and avoid the lines.
,,,,,"Ohhh, yes indeed! When I was booked to travel to Seattle, I began poring over Yelp reviews and various blogs to find the best of the best. A stop at Beecher's was basically unanimous across all avenues consulted."
,,,,,"I love cheese. I love mac and cheese. When I stepped into Beecher's, I was amazed. It is a cheesy wonderland. So much cheese. I wanted to try everything. I wanted to snorkel in the vat of almost-cheese being stirred in front of onlookers. Alas, my cheesy dreams were reduced to ordering a large mac and cheese dubbed the ""world's best."" Mac container in tow, I found a quietish spot with an ocean view to begin my nosh. "
,,,,,"Immediately, I was in love. It's the best mac and cheese I've ever had (sorry, mom!). The penne noodles were the perfect texture and the cheese was so creamy and heavenly. I have two more days in Seattle and I have no doubt that both days will include a stop at Beecher's. I love their cheese in all forms and I can't wait to try as much as humanly possible."
,,,,,"Is there such a thing as 5 star mac and cheese?? Why yes.... yes there is!!! They have their sauce down to a science. So perfectly creamy, so so decadent. Not for anyone lactose and tolerant haha! Lines are crazy but it moves really quickly."
,,,,,"They have two options- with the spicy famous pickled veggies or regular. I opted to get the veggie one to try something new. I think it's the best Mac and cheese I've ever had- no joke. No thrills, no ornaments, just plain cheese and pasta  heaven. "
,,,,,I want to eat this every day
,,,,,"Beecher's is at the top of the list for food in Seattle. I missed it last time, so this is redemption. The line was relatively long, but the wait for food was quite short. We ordered the flagship sandwich, smoked turkey, and the chicken, mama lil's, and arugula sandwich. I wanted the roast beef marco polo sandwich, but it wasn't on the menu anymore. There was no dine-in area, so we took it to go. "
,,,,,"Flagship Sandwich  (3/5): It has a strong cheese taste and the addition of the tomatoes made the sandwich less heavy and easier to stomach. PS: To be honest, this sandwich is delicious and I would have rated it a 5/5 if I haven't tasted the other two sandwiches."
,,,,,"Smoked Turkey  (5/5): There was a generous amount of turkey in the sandwich and with the cheese and toasted bread, there's not more I can say. It is a simple yet delicious sandwich. I would recommend. "
,,,,,"Chicken, Mama Lil's, and Arugula (5/5): This was delicious. Done. The chicken and cheese mixed well together, and Mama Lil's mayo had a kick of spice to it."
,,,,,"A bit disappointed that the flagship sandwich wasn't quite up to par, but nevertheless, still damn good."
,,,,,Seattle is my third home. In the perfect world I would visit the city annually. But this time around it has been about 4 years since my last trip. The first thing I did after landing at SeaTac and checking into my Wonderful Room at the W was to... *drum rolls*
,,,,,"Hands down it was to get an order of Bercher's ""World's Best"" Mac & Cheese!! "
,,,,,*drools*
,,,,,"I first discovered this over 10 years ago on my first trip to the Pac Northwest. Pike was of course one of the destinations I had to venture due to my love for food and passion to culture. It has been a staple each time I go visit. Sometimes if I am lucky, I will go twice. And actually, this time around I went twice!"
,,,,,"The best thing to do is have multiple people. Get the classic and the seasonal/special Mac & Cheese. This time around it was a Southwestern flavor one. It was still so good! If you can, try one of their sandwiches. Anything with Beecher's cheese is mouthwatering delicious!"
,,,,,"10 years ago, there was never a super long line. Now... oh, boy! It's like Disneyland. Going around lunch (12pm - 2pm) was intense on a Friday. However, when I went back on Sunday morning right when they opened at 9am... winner, winner! Cheese dinner! Hahaha... or in this case Mac & Cheese for breakfast and no line; just a mere handful of people. "
,,,,,"So being a lover of cheese, this spot is heavenly. Thank goodness Beecher's does sell their cheeses at grocery stores across the nation. Sadly, there is just the Beecher's cafes in Washington State and New York. They just need to extend to OC/LA!"
,,,,,"Located at Pike Place Market! I'll be honest... I never stopped by here because I didn't see any point standing in the long line for ""Mac and Cheese"" and I lived in Washington for over 20 years. I did however always enjoyed viewing through the large windows to see how they make cheese. So fast forward... My four year old suddenly wanted macaroni and cheese when I couldn't make a stop to dine in anywhere and I thought of Beecher's. Miraculously, the line was not that long and I ordered few things. We ate in the car and wow... this was one of the best macaroni and cheese that I have ever tasted! It is very rich in flavor and the pasta was even cooked perfectly. And even the garlicky bread was amazing. I went back to grab the larger ounce so I could have rest of the family try it. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area!"
,,,,,"Having heard a lot about this place which is famous for it's cheese , I thought of trying this place. On a warm Sunday , we visited this place. Social distancing was followed at this place. I grabbed a Tomato flagship basil sandwich and french onion soup to go. The sandwich is so crispy and I loved it. It didn't loose it's crispness even after some time .Enjoyed and loved every bit of this sandwich . The French onion soup was really tasty too! I was happy about my visit to this restaurant and also the safety measures that were been followed strictly! Definitely looking forward to try kimchi sandwich next when I visit Pike place!"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"After the sticker shock of $90 for four mac-n-cheeses and four sandwiches, I thought our food was good but not worth the price. Every employee was friendly and the food is prepared quickly."
,,,,,"I've always loved this place and make it a point to come here anytime I'm in Seattle.   My favorite is the southwest style Mac and Cheese, the regular is good too but the SW is best.  "
,,,,,"I tried the smoked salmon version they had on this trip which seemed like the same recipe for the SW just with Salmon.  You could barely taste the salmon which I thought was a good thing because I was scared it would be ""fishy""."
,,,,,"Ordered the 8oz ""world's best mac and cheese"" and it tastes delicious! I would highly recommend sticking to their classic! It was extremely flavorful and it's the type of mac and cheese I would want more of. "
,,,,,"I also ordered their lasagna - beechers cheese curds lasagna, and I do not reccomend it. It does not taste good, and lasagna is about layers. Their lasagna was two layers and it was very dry, and did not taste good. It was also $$ for a small piece. "
,,,,,I would highly reccomend sticking to their classic mac and cheese!
,,,,,Never have I experienced a cheese factory before and this was so cool. The staff was so friendly and recommended a delicious cheese to us! Wish they had more of it because never had a sheep & goat cheese before! We can't wait to come back!
,,,,,"Next to Rachel's Ginger Beer and Pike's Place Chowder, a must-try at the Pike Place Market! Super cool to see a part of the cheese making process through the glass window. Got the signature mac & cheese, it was very rich and creamy but loved the fragrant cheese flavor and the slight spicy kick from the chili flakes."
,,,,,"My sister-in-law wanted to try this on day 1 of our seattle trip but sadly, we didnt get to try it until the day before we left. We wanted to sample a lot of places so we got a large container of the mac and cheese to share amongst 4 of us. "
,,,,,"I wanted more and I wish we got more but I wanted a second helping of Rachel's Ginger Beer. Also I'm lactose intolerant so I didn't even know if I could have a lot of this, but I tried it anyway. It was delicious so I risked it and kept eating more. Worth it and it didn't give me stomach issues. I'd come back here again if I could."
,,,,,"Yas!!!!! Everyone always raves about the place in Pike Place, so I was super excited to visit. Mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods in the world so I had to try the Mac and cheese. This Mac and cheese was so cheesy, gooey, and rich! I enjoyed every single bite! I came back the next today to try the lasagna because I was so impressed with the cheese here. Lasagna was quite good, but not as mind blowing as the Mac and cheese and was also slightly over peppered in my opinion. Mac and cheese would be a 5/5 but the lasagna would have to be 3.5-4/5. Surprisingly the wait wasn't long (probably bc with covid and the fires so people are staying indoors)."
,,,,,Good isn't great and great isn't good ever heard of the saying? Want to know what's great?? Beechers!
,,,,,You will understand why there's a line out the door to get into this famous cheese eatery; you might ask yourself quoting David Byrne's famous Talking Heads line.. same as it ever was?  Cheese really?
,,,,,Nope not Beecher's..it's FREAKIN FANTASTIC!
,,,,,"The menu is cheese paradise: tuna melt, grilled cheese and the famous Mac and cheese. Cheese! Cheese! Glorious cheese!"
,,,,,This location is right outside of the Public Market on Pike Street; it's small but quaint.. You know the saying good things come in small packages and Beecher delivers!
,,,,,They also sell cheese to go as well as other quaint items like a QT cutting board and honey and chips and all other great stuff.
,,,,,"On this visit I had to control myself since my intermitting fasting is still going on, however, I ordered the small tomato soup which next time I come will be becoming a large one because it is so delicious!"
,,,,,"How delicious? Well let's just say Beechers got Ina Garten, yes ladies and gentlemen, Ina Garten beat. I've been making her famous tomato soup with cheese croutons all through the pandemic and wow I really thought that was it...no.. siree...Bob! Beechers got her beat,  sorry Ina! "
,,,,,"The courteous server who worked at the Flat Iron district in New York location asked "" cheese and croutons on top?"" Again had to control that, just a little cheese please, no croutons!"
,,,,,There is no inside dining as of now because Seattle is still in phase 2 of COVID-19 however I did dine alfresco outside the market and enjoyed every single drop of my tomato soup!
,,,,,"Do you want to cure the COVID-19 blues? Well, if you're in Seattle or New York head over to Beecher's handmade cheese shop or order online they're on Instagram!"
,,,,,Letting the days go by... at Beechers!
,,,,,Ok this was definitely some of the best cheese I've ever had!
,,,,,The tomato soup tasted great and creamy. The grilled cheese could be better if they had good bread
,,,,,"Regular price range, parking is easy, staff were not friendly but it is what it is"
,,,,,I really liked this place. I got the salmon Mac and cheese with dill. It was really great and the cheese they used was nice and creamy. Dill is one of my favorite herbs and it goes so well with the salmon in here. My only complaint is that I wish the noddles were more al dente as they fell apart too easily.

,,,,,Delicious Mac and cheese (extremely creamy) and cheese curds. Quick service and friendly staff!
,,,,,I absolutely love Beechers cheese especially their cheese curds and flagship cheese they always have on display for samples in their store! (So sad because of covid they don't have these samples out nowadays :( ) I've purchased the curds at least 5 times not since the last 5 times I've been here! 
,,,,,I've also tried their Mac and cheese which was so cheesy and also their grilled cheese which was also very crispy and delicious  
,,,,,Beechers is always a must go whenever I travel to Seattle! 
,,,,,Here is the post I made for their Mac and cheese on my food Instagram! 
,,,,,"Beecher's came up a lot when researching foods to try in Seattle, so we took our place in a line that went a little around the block just to try it!! We ordered the mac n cheese and a breadzel."
,,,,,"The mac n cheese is super cheesy (I love cheese) so it loved it immediately. It took a little while for my boyfriend to warm up to it -- he initially thought it was too cheesy, but he did end up enjoying it. The bread was pretty dry to us, so we started dipping it in the cheesy sauce from the mac and it tasted a bit better that way. I personally wouldn't order the breadzel again."
,,,,,"Overall, I don't think we tried enough to give an absolute 5 stars, but it was pretty solid, and I do wish I tried more of the food! If I lived nearby, I would totally buy the actual cheeses to take home and cook with."
,,,,,Beecher's was my favorite part of visiting Pike Place Market.  On a rainy day in Seattle walking in and out of all the little shops stumbling into a place that had the best smell ever. Turning into the shop and seeing two guys making a giant tub of cheese. I feel like I didn't truly believe in heaven into I stepped foot into here. 
,,,,,"So. Much. Cheese. Not just any cheese, amazing cheese at that. I had a hard time deciding on what to get as a snack. I wanted to get everything. But we settled on the Mac & Cheese.  We can blame it on peer pressure but it was a solid choice. "
,,,,,The Mac & Cheese is unreal perfection.  
,,,,,"Everyone here working was really nice and seemed to be really into what they were doing. I, for one, appreciate that for people who have to deal with tourists like myself all day, err day. "
,,,,,"Whenever I return back to Seattle though,  that grilled cheese is mine."
,,,,,"I only had the mac and cheese, but I was definitely impressed.  If you're looking to explore Pike Place Market and want to sample several eateries, I would suggest that you include Beecher's.  Had this been my last stop, I would have picked up some cheese curds too, but I had more eating planned so I didn't want to go overboard in one location."
,,,,,Giving Beecher's ALL THE STARS
,,,,,"I've never in my life had mac and cheese like this before! I ordered a super creamy, velvety and delicious warm bowl right before my flight. I instantly regret not buying a bigger bowl and extra for back home. Wish this was one of my first stops when I was in Seattle so that I could have enjoyed it every day omg. During COVID, Beecher's is open and following CDC guidelines to ensure public safety. I walked in and about 1-2 customer groups inside while the line is outside."
,,,,,TLDR Beechers is a MUST GO TO when you're in Seattle! It's just incredible and I'm so happy I got to try them out when I did. Only wish I discovered them a lot sooner during my stay.
,,,,,"Got there around 530pm on a Saturday. The line moved quick, and was less than a 10 min. wait.  Got a couple of 8oz mac n cheeses, and a Flagship grilled cheese sandwich.  They were both excellent.   Interesting to see them making the cheese they use on the food."
,,,,,"This is a staple when in Pikes market place. They have the cheese made right in front of the window for your viewing pleasure while you wait because let's be real there is usually a line. I got the ""worlds best"" mac n cheese small and it was yummy, had a smoky flavor. You can also get the salmon one or they also have gluten free options. This flagship location is a must try when in Seattle."
,,,,,"Beecher's is one of many well-known names that have sprung out of Pike Place Market, in addition to one ubiquitous coffee chain with a green mermaid logo."
,,,,,"Here at this flagship store you can watch them make cheese live, as it all happens at their cornerfront window. You can grab some hot snacks to eat while you peruse the neighborhood, whether grilled cheese sandwiches, ready-made mac and cheese, or cheese curds. There's also a display case in the rear with lots of cheese, and another in the front with prepared items to reheat at home. "
,,,,,"When I stopped by it was a quick-serve, in-and-out setup with friendly staff. A touristy venue, for sure, but at least it lives up to the hype."
,,,,,"What a absolute treat to be able to travel before all this madness. As we were walking down the world famous Pike place market and ALL we heard was people chatting about Beecher's. I even made a comment to my bf that we should prob check this place out and a random person stopped me to say, YOU REALLY NEED TO. "
,,,,,Needless to say we stopped in. it was really fun to watch a HUGE tub of cheese being made right in front of our eyes. When you continue to walk into this small cheese shop they have samples of their homemade cheese with crackers and of course those cheeses for purchase. 
,,,,,What I loved about Beecher's was that everyone was over the top friendly with their recommendations. I was stuck on what to order and without  hesitation i was told by 3-4 people that the mac and cheese and to die for. So who am i to not die for it? literally a swipe of a card later our mac and cheese was handed over. We shared one and it was a perfect mid-day snack. This cheese oowewy gooey mac and cheese was soo creamy and cheesey it hit every savory taste bud. The overall combination was def unique to Beecher's!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Beecher stans don't hate me, but it seemed slightly overrated. It was good but not the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. Honestly wish it was more cheesy then creamy and wish it was baked or even had some bread crumbs. I did like the red pepper flakes though"
,,,,,"I'm not even ashamed that I stopped by three days in a row for their mac n' cheese. It's amazing! Perfect texture, creamy, and the cheese is just sharp enough not to taste boring."
,,,,,"You can watch the cheese be handled through machinery via large windows. The employees were friendly, several waving and giving a thumbs up as we took pictures and videos."
,,,,,My favorite grab and go place. I always get frozen mac and cheese to take home. I recommend the grilled cheese and tomato soup
,,,,,No words to describe Bechers because it's incredible. Get the Mac and cheese and you'll know what I mean. :) you're welcome. 
,,,,,Lines can sometimes be long. But way worth it
,,,,,Breadzel was so good that I wouldn't mind buying more to bring home. It just the right amount of punch. 
,,,,,Mac and cheese was amazing as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the smoked salmon one. All the cheesy creamy goodness was worth it.
,,,,,"The mac n cheese may be expensive, but holy cow is it worth it for the experience"
,,,,,I am a huge cheese fan so when in the area I had to try the ''worlds best mac and cheese'' because I am a foodie and trips heavily involve eating everything! The line wasn't as long as I expected at the time so that was a plus. The line moved quickly and the place kept covid guide lines. Ordered the small and it was enough for me and the wife to both pick from. Def top 3 man and cheeses I have had. You can also just buy cheese because cheese!
,,,,,"A friend said that this was highly recommend to her, so naturally I decided to give it a try too. Even though mac & cheese is an overall simple dish, I have to admit that it was different from any mac & cheese I've had. It was very flavorful and had a great of consistency. The establishment was closed for dine in. Everyone wore masks and they had a limit of 9 people in the establishment at a time."
,,,,,"My first time to Seattle, my girlfriend directed us to Beecher's for grilled cheese sandwiches.  The promise of heavenly tasting cheese held up under my scrutiny.  They were in fact scrumptious!!!"
,,,,,The shop makes the cheese in a room displayed in the front window and are appropriately located on Pikes Place in the market complex.  
,,,,,"I love a short menu - ""Don't serve it unless your proud of your product."""
,,,,,Beecher's holds true to my ideology by keeping it simple and tasty.
,,,,,"There are places to sit inside, but it's a crowded experience.  Best to relax and enjoy the crowds who share your love of creamy delicious cheese and immerse yourself in Beecher's."
,,,,,okay i thought this place was overhyped at first but omg literally the best mac and cheese ever. i didn't think mac and cheese could really get any better but what an amazing surprise! i got the worlds best mac and cheese and definitely wish i tried more stuff. it was so so cheesy. the pasta was cooked just right too. definitely will come back when i can!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Beecher's is a must anytime I'm visiting Seattle. I don't always eat Mac n Cheese but I'll always find myself here when I'm in town. I'll usually order their World's Best Mac n Cheese - it's so rich, creamy, and delicious. This time I also grabbed their Flagship Sandwich as they were already sold out of their Tuna Melt sandwich (about an hour before closing on Sunday). The Flagship Sandwich was good - I can appreciate how simple the ingredients were but also how much flavor pulled through. "
,,,,,No seating/eating in the shop itself but you can take your food items and go to the dock and enjoy them with a waterfront view!
,,,,,I love stopping by here when I visit Seattle. The cheese is so tasty!
,,,,,"For the first time on my most recent trip, I actually got some meal type food. I split the mac & cheese, grilled cheese, and the breadzel with my husband. The mac & cheese did not disappoint -- it's perfectly cheesy and not too greasy. I also really enjoyed the grilled cheese, but my husband thought it was too bread-heavy. "
,,,,,"The breadzel was disappointing. It should have been listed as spicy. I can handle a little spice, but this was too spicy for me -- I couldn't even eat it. I wouldn't have ordered it if I had just been labeled properly."
,,,,,"Hands down the best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life! Something just hits different about enjoying a hot cup of deliciousness while watching the cheese makers at work with the cloudy, cold weather in the background. "
,,,,,"We tried the original version which was outstanding. The others looked tasty as well, but I wanted the cheese to be the main star. It was packed with flavor in every bite! We also got some of the cheese curds which were spectacular as well. Being from Wisconsin I know my cheese curds and these were top notch. "
,,,,,This is a definitely must eat spot in Seattle! Do not miss it!
,,,,,Holy Shit. Sooooo good. Had the world famous Mac and cheese and a grilled cheese. Both were the best items of their class that I have ever had. I can't recommend this place enough.
,,,,,"If you're looking for a great mac and cheese, it's a five star place. If you're looking for a great Mac and cheese, kind, and amicable service... this isn't the place."
,,,,,"During our visit, we had two rude interactions. They were mostly associated with one employee-two employees. The gentleman at the register, not wearing a mask, and with lighter hair snapped at myself and my boyfriend when we asked politely about how the line system worked. And when we were checking out he rudely snapped at us again (this time about me asking if there was a bag fee). I'm really disappointed with the lack of customer service, and the lack of hospitality of Beecher's."
,,,,,not a macaroni expert or con oh sore or whateva but this was pretty good
,,,,,i got the worlds best smoke salmon
,,,,,it was cheesy and it was good
,,,,,the noodles were cooked good and this is coming from someone that doesn't eat a lot of pasta so don't take this comparison to nothing as a measuring stick for what you're used to
,,,,,this former Steelers player complaining about his former teams perfomance seems scripted but the taste here is not
,,,,,they also offer in 2 sizes I think one 8oz and a 12oz
,,,,,we got the 8oz so we can mob around and grub at the same time (cuz no dine in unless proof of backflips and upside down splits - leotards optional)
,,,,,they have a menu outside and a place to line up at so you're not in the way of other people trying to go to the worlds first startbacks or whateva
,,,,,the menu was a lot for me so I just went with the first thing that caught my eye and smoked salmon was near the top and that's what reeled me..............in
,,,,,k bye
,,,,,Oh yeah and 5 stars because I had a wonderful experience here. Quick and easy just like my favorite box pancake mix (it's not called quick and easy I was referring to the process)
,,,,,The price was like $13 for the 8oz cup which is basically a supersized sacrament cup and a sea turtles worst enemy's cousin - plastic bottle of water
,,,,,Malo
,,,,,Best Mac and cheese I have ever had and I don't say that lightly. There is ALWAYS a line so I would try to get there as close to when they open as possible and even then be ready to wait a bit in line. So worth it. If you're heading to pike place this is a must try.
,,,,,It does the best cheese store in town
,,,,,You could not find another store with such an authentic American cheese
,,,,,And the Mac and cheese is soooo delicious 
,,,,,I know it is all about calorie  but u ll regret if u don't try it it is soooooo worth it
,,,,,"Totally worth the wait in the long lines but if you can beat the lunch rush, go for it! The Mac and cheese is to die for! I wish I would have bought more or bought just the cheese so I could make some at home. It's so creamy and full of heavenly goodness. "
,,,,,They sell other things there too. Like the kimchi grilled cheese. I'm not a fan of kimchi but my brother and sister in law couldn't get enough of those things!
,,,,,"It is an experience to see cheese being made in front of you while having dinner. I visited solo here and found a good company next to me, a local lady to talk and have dinner. Food is great here and atmosphere is welcoming and lively. This place is very busy for right reasons!"
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"It's worth all the hype! Some of the best cheesy Mac I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. The line was pretty long upon arrival but don't let it discourage you, it moves really fast and you won't regret the wait once you've had the chance to try it!"
,,,,,"Visited on 8/24, the staff was friendly and understood we were tourist. The place is very clean, and organized. I even overheard one of the workers having a conversation with a customer to figure out what type of cheese they like. We ordered the lasagne and the Mac and cheese to share, both were excellent and it's a must try place, I'm not a cheese connoisseur but I really enjoyed the complexity in the flavors of their cheese. Next time we go back we will probably look to pick up one of their take home kits."
,,,,,"I am a Mac and cheese fanatic, and I must say that Beechers Mac is beyond compare! I LOVE ot"
,,,,,"We were in Seattle a year ago but never had the chance to try this place as it was too busy. Due to the pandemic, there was no one here this time so we finally got to see what the big fuss was about. The wife got the large size of the regular mac and cheese, a garlic bread, and a small container of cheese curds. Price is to be expected for a shop at Pike Place."
,,,,,"The mac and cheese was good but not great. It was bit rich for my taste but I was happy that I got to try it. The curds were also good but again nothing special. The bread was bad but that was probably our fault as we waited until we got back to our rental to eat it--- so it was quite hard. Overall, glad we tried this place to say that we did but that's about it."
,,,,,"We had to stop at Beechers Cheese Market for some grilled cheese, though had I known it was also at Sea Tac Airport, maybe I would have waited! Their flagship cheese is somewhere between cheddar and gruyere, it melted great, it had a dynamite sharp flavor. I admit, I would've liked to have tried their Mac and cheese. The Breadzel was basically an herb and cheese bread, I would really recommend getting some tomato soup to dip it in."
,,,,,"Terrible service my friend and I ordered 3 grilled cheese sandwhiches and mac n cheese to go and  the mac n cheese was served immediately after paying for the order. We waited about 12 minutes for the grilled cheese which was served steaming hot and the mac n cheese was already cold by the time we got the grilled cheese so I kindly asked if we can get another cup of mac n cheese or of they can warm it up since it's cold and she said oh we don't do that . I said well you shoukd have served the mac n cheese with the grilled cheese and she said we don't fo that. I was in shock.  Terrible service, she also insisted to get the mac n cheese and we get to eat it all cold. Make sure to ask for the mac n cheese once the sandwhich is ready. The grilled cheese was just ok served on a sourdough bread."
,,,,,"We saw a giant tub of cheese through the window and we had to stop by to check it out! Everything on their menu looked so good, but we opted for their 8oz classic mac n cheese. So good! I loved that they used penne pasta! The cheese was really flavorful and had a good amount of spice in it."
,,,,,Yumm! I love the original Mac n cheese but the salmon was a nice step up. Can never come to Seattle with out stopping for a fix.
,,,,,"I'm not a huge fan of white cheddar Mac n cheese, but you can't come to pike's place and not try this Mac n cheese. I love that you can watch them make the cheese and the pasta. Everything was very fresh I just wish there were more than one Mac n cheese option. The flavor is strong and a little hard to finish 8 oz worth. As a side note if you have 2-3 people in your party that would like to share, ask for the 16 oz and extra cups instead of paying for 8 oz per person."
,,,,,"Had the flagship sandwich with tomato soup, also shared mac and cheese with husband and everything was delicious. You can see the cheese being made. Restaurant is very small and seating is very limited and uncomfortable. More seating available across the market."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,The hot and delicious Mac and cheese was fabulous!  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the cheese flavor was the best we've ever had.  Highly recommend stopping here when in Pike Place Market!
,,,,,"Oh come on now, how can you not love the cheesy goodness of Beecher's Cheese? Even if you're lactose intolerant you have to try their delicious mac & cheese!"
,,,,,"This was another food vendor visit on our food tour at the Pike Place Market. We got to try cheese curds, samples of different cheeses, and of course that amazing cup of gooey mac & cheesy yumminess."
,,,,,"Not gonna lie, I wanted to eat myself into a cheese coma here. Alas, we had to move on to the next stop."
,,,,,This location is a must when in Seattle. You hear about this place and it's yummy cheese all the time and it's definitely worth it to stop by. The big winner for them: their Mac and cheese. This Mac and cheese is so good! I tell everyone about it and always have someone pick me up some if they're around their shop. I'm obsessed with the sharp cheesy homemade Mac.
,,,,,You can get this in the frozen Isle at Costco and I've definitely picked some up for those days where I want something good but don't want to make the trek into Seattle just for Mac and cheese.  It's pretty dang good!
,,,,,Omg this grilled cheese was sooooo delicious!!! I had absolutely no complaints! And watching them make the cheese was a plus for me
,,,,,*pre COVID review* 
,,,,,"I've seen this place featured in so many travel videos, so I made note that if I ever visited Seattle that I would come here. Definitely does not disappoint!! "
,,,,,"I ordered both the World's Best Mac and Cheese and the Mariachi Mac and both were delicious, however the Mariachi Mac was superior to the World's best. "
,,,,,"The World's Best was not your typical macaroni shaped pasta or gooey thick cheese. Instead, it had penne pasta and it was more of like a really creamy cheese tasting pasta that was super flavorful, but was too basic and simple. However, I liked the Mariachi Mac sooo much more. It had the same creamy consistency as the World's Best but also had flavors from the stir fried peppers and had a little kick of spice to it. It was sosososo good and a must-try here, 10/10!!! "
,,,,,A really solid place to stop by for a little snack while you're around the Pike Place market!
,,,,,"We had the worlds best mac and cheese and a tuna melt. Ofcourse the mac and cheese is amazing! So creamy and cheesy! We'll try other kinds next time. The tuna melt was pretty good too! Also, its nice to see how they make the cheese on the side. Friendly staff as well!"
,,,,,"Came here around three in the afternoon and it was nice and quiet. Finally got to try the famous Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was cheesy and thicker than the frozen packs they sell. The Mac n cheese is stored in a warming pot before purchase, so it was warm but I would have loved it, if it was hotter.  My 8OZ cup came out to about $7.49 which is on the pricier side but it is one of the must eats of Seattle. They were sold out of their cheesy breadtzel, which I hope to try next time. There is also a wide selection of cheeses and they produce the cheese in the sectioned off glass room, in store. It is a must see adventure if you have visitors coming to Seattle."
,,,,,A really yummy spot for mac and cheese right in Pike Place Market! It's a popular touristy destination but also just plain good. I joked that it was similar to Ghirardelli Square because you can see the cheese being made in the large vats in the store. 
,,,,,We got a small Mariachi mac and cheese and it was really creamy and great! The cheese was high quality and it had a bit of a kick -- this spicy mac it was a lot more flavorful than regular mac and cheese.
,,,,,I'm not a big cheese fan but wow this place was so good! And the grilled cheese with tomato soup is a must during the cold weather
,,,,,Stopped by while we were in town. The Mac & Cheese was pretty good it had too much of an overpowering flavor in it that I can't even pin point to say what it was. It was creamy and pasta was cooked pretty well. We loved their grilled cheese far more and deff recommend! 
,,,,,It's a good stop to try !
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,This place is supposed to have the world's best Mac and cheese! 
,,,,,"They have a section where you can buy cheeses, cheese curds and other to go items."
,,,,,"They have about 8 different type of grilled cheeses, two Mac and cheese types, and tomato soup!"
,,,,,"We got the ""world famous Mac and cheese"" which had Gouda, Brie and a few other cheeses. I got the small and it was about $7 total "
,,,,,It was really good but could have used some meat or veggies. We didn't get the mariachi Mac and cheese (which includes green Chile's and a ton of veggies)
,,,,,Beecher's Handmade Cheese was on the list of places that my daughter and I wanted to try. They are known for their glass wall cheese making kitchens and for using quality ingredients. Their cheese does not have artificial ingredients. 
,,,,,We ordered their Flagship Tomato and Basil Sandwich and loved it!!! It is clearly the best grilled cheese sandwich ever. The basil was very fresh and taste amazing with the tomato and cheese. The bread was crunchy along the edge and softer in the center. 
,,,,,They had many other items on the menu but I can't imagine moving past the Flagship sandwich. It is perfection.
,,,,,I was told when I visited Seattle I needed try Beechers. And I can see why. 10/10 I LOVE this
,,,,,"Smooth, velvety, creamy, the ""world's best"" mac n cheese certainly holds its own. I do prefer a thicker mac n cheese but Beecher's is certainly an experience. I would also recommend getting a breadzel (like a cheese bun) so you can soak up all the leftover cheese sauce."
,,,,,"I was told to try this place out when I came to town, and here we are! The Mac and cheese really is some of the best I've ever had! So fresh and creamy! I'll be grabbing some more before leaving town! "
,,,,,"I also tried the beadzel. It was a little dry, but overall pretty good flavors!"
,,,,,Grilled Cheese fans take my word and come here!!! My husband and I shared a grilled cheese sandwich and devoured it within 2 minutes because it was that good. They had a variety of cheeses to purchase and butter which is great if you're into good quality and great taste.
,,,,,"The employees were nice and accommodating. I will say it did take a bit long to make the grilled cheese about 10 minutes and there wasn't a line when we arrived. Sometimes the experience is about waiting ,right! I don't know if they offered Tomato soup but that would be a whole game changer dipping the sandwiches into the soup. Just wow!!! "
,,,,,Highly recommend!
,,,,,"It is definitely the best Mac n cheese I've ever had, but for the price... may just be a one time experience for me. I definitely had to give it a try since it's the touristy thing to do and was not disappointed!"
,,,,,"Quick weekend foodie trip to Seattle! Definitely want to come back ASAP. We got a small Mac n cheese to share just so we can hit up other spots without getting too full. The line gets pretty long later in the day, so better stop by earlier in the morning! "
,,,,,BOY did I wish I got a large for myself! LITERALLY BEST MAC N CHEESE EVER. I feel like I could've ate 3 smalls to myself. You can eat so much of it without feeling too full.  I NEEEEED IT.
,,,,,"Came here to try their cheese and got their original mac and cheese as well as the flavored one. Both are good, but definitely preferred the original one more. A fun tourist spot, you can see them make cheese in the window. Line can get long, but goes by quickly."
,,,,,Got to be their 3000th review!
,,,,,"Finally tried the famous Beecher's and I'm glad to report that it was just as good as I imagined. The size price correlation is kinda not proportional, but everything at pike place is kinda ridiculously expensive so I wasn't caught off guard. The cheese itself is delicious. I wish I could put it on any and everything. It was so good that I tried the shake shake burger with it and it too was phenomenal. Kind of an expensive treat, but I know I will definitely be treating myself again to this gem. Worth trying at least once, but I can't promise you you won't get hooked."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I only had during Food Tour I took recently & it was very good.  We had a sample of the macaroni & cheese and other cheeses. They were all really good.  Definitely will go back when in the area visiting.
,,,,,"Walked over to beecher's from our hotel 20 min before it opened up at 10am  we thought there would have been a line but it looked like they had opened up early and the doors were open with customers waiting in line, really cool experience watching the cheese being made in front of you loved the free samples cheeses"
,,,,,I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have the Mariachi Mac&Cheese fresh but they did have it frozen
,,,,,Overall the Mac&Cheese and Grilled cheese were good !!!!
,,,,,"I came here just before closing on a Wednesday and ordered the Flagship Grilled Cheese after hearing a LOT of hype and, I love my grilled cheese. It was really good! I just don't know that I'd be able to identify it in a blind taste test against other grilled cheese sandwiches using similar ingredients (jack cheese, basil, tomato, cheese sauce). It was super tasty though and if you want a quick bite to eat and be able to keep walking, I'd stop here for sure. Next time I'll try the mac n' cheese!"
,,,,,Great atmosphere awesome food! Only issue is no cash taken! People can be disinfranchised because they don't have credit debit cards or prefer to use cash as way to limit spending.
,,,,,There is not more coin shortage so they should take cash as it is legal tender
,,,,,"My bf and I were on our way to the famous Pike Place Chowder after finishing taking pictures by the ocean viewpoint, and we literally could not resist the incredibly alluring aroma coming from Beecher's. "
,,,,,We already had so many food spots in our itinerary but come on. Handmade cheese. THE SMELL OF MELTED CHEESE. We didn't even have to think twice walking inside. 
,,,,,"Immediately we were recommended the flagship sandwich and tomato soup, sadly passing on the smoked salmon mac and cheese since we were already getting creamy chowder later although we heard that was also fire. But when I say this was probably the best tomato soup we have had... It truly was LOL I loved it so much, I wish we ordered a bigger size. It was super hearty and rich, complete with croutons and melted cheese. With the sandwich it was a perfect pair. So glad I succumbed to the smell and walked in HAHA. "
,,,,,Tldr I highly recommend this place to get your cheesy fix and I will be thinking about this tomato soup for a long time );
,,,,,Stopped here while visiting the area and after seeing amazing reviews. The Mac and cheese was heavenly. My boyfriend got the Flagship grilled cheese. He enjoyed it but we both loved the Mac. Highly recommend.
,,,,,"My friend told me I had to get their mac & cheese, so... I obliged! And I'm so glad I did. There can never be too much cheese, right? The mac & cheese is SUUUPER cheesy. It's thicccc! I got their smallest size as I was getting other food around the market, too. Would visit again."
,,,,,"You can smell the cheese from the open doors of Beecher's. The cheese making area is on the right of the main restaurant area. We got a small world's best mac and cheese, and it was sooooo yummy. The cheese sauce has a little kick to it, which makes the richness of the cheese very addicting. The pasta itself was a little past al debate, but it's to be expected since they make huge batches at a time of the mac and cheese. I would highly recommend coming here to get a cup of mac, especially on a cool, rainy day."
,,,,,Food: 5/5
,,,,,"The ""World's Best Mac and Cheese"" is genuinely one of the best Mac and Cheese dishes I've had EVER.  I'd call myself a pretty choosy (aka picky) eater when it comes to Mac & Cheese so I was so happy that this cheese still had a classic taste while being so much lighter yet indulgent at the same time."
,,,,,"Definitely check this place out!!!  My only regret is not going back to get their grilled cheese (which is made with their flagship cheese made in-house), but next time for sure!"
,,,,,I love Mac n cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches so I was really looking forward to trying beecher's. 
,,,,,The Mac n cheese was so creamy and delicious. It had a good consistency. 
,,,,,I tried the regular cheese sandwich and got tomato soup on the side. Such a good combo. I also got the kimchi grilled sandwich. It was so bomb. Better than the regular. Just wish it was spicy.

,,,,,I cannot talk about this place enough! Too bad I had so much to eat in Seattle I didn't get a chance for round 2! Their world's best mac n cheese is OUT OF THSIS WORLD. I have never had mac n cheese like this ever in my life. I literally have been talking about Beechers since the first time I had it in 2019. It is just THAT good. I love that you can see them making cheese and the foods through the window. They also sell cheese togo for those who want to take some home. I can see locals coming out to Pike's place just to hang out and eating all this delicious food.
,,,,,I will be in Seattle next weekend again so this is high up on my list! I will have to save room for the tomato soup and smoked salmon mac n cheese.
,,,,,"We got the small world's best mac and cheese, and it was so worth the hype. The cheese didn't feel too heavy, and the portion could either be enjoyed by yourself or sharing with a friend. We were lucky that there were some seatings inside, so we sat down and watch the cheese being made in front of us. What an experience!"
,,,,,"Love, Love, Love! My wife is a HUGE mac n cheese fan. This spot did not disappoint. The cheese is very creamy but also very smooth at the same time. I truly believe that if you are a big time cheese lover you must stop by. The line is usually going to be long and wrap around the corner of the store, but it is worth it. It was so good couldnt even get a picture of ours, didnt realize it until after we were done."
,,,,,"One of the best and most popular restaurant at Pike place!  I would definitely recommend ordering online and then wait for pickup, otherwise the lines can be long.  I ordered the smoked Turkey cheese sandwich, and it was delightful!  The cheese itself is creamy, great contrast with the Turkey, tomato and bread.  Would definitely comeback when I'm in Seattle."
,,,,,"Being from WI, I'd like to think I've eaten an above average amount of cheese in my life including a lot of mac & cheeses and Beecher's definitely ranks up there. During our initial visit, we ordered the ""world's best"" mac & cheese - decadent, creamy, well balance of subtle sharpness and spice from the cheese. We ended up going back the next day because we wanted to try the  smoked salmon mac & cheese as well - strong dill flavor, the smoked salmon was flavorful but limited, wish there was a bit more smoked salmon. Would probably stick with just ordering the ""world's best"" the next time we're back.  Very limited seating but like many of the places in Pikes Place, it was more of a grab-and-go type of situation - we never had issues find a quick place to sit outdoors in the surrounding area and especially nice finding a place overlooking the water. It was neat seeing the cheese production while waiting in line or if you're lucky enough to snag a seat in their store."
,,,,,Must go to place in Pike Place for an chezy experience.
,,,,,It gets pretty crowded with tourists so highly recommend coming here earlier in the morning.
,,,,,"Shop is pretty small, with limited indoor counter top seating."
,,,,,They have a tank of milk for people to see how the chez is made.
,,,,,Service is pretty quick so line moves fast if its not overly crowded.
,,,,,We got the 8 oz Worlds Famous Mac and Cheese and Smoked Salmon Mac and Cheese ($6.99 each).
,,,,,"Loved the Worlds Famous Mac and Cheese! Very creamy and cheesy, not overly salty, the penne noodles complimented well with the sauce."
,,,,,"Smoked salmon was also good, had a nice smokey flavor from the salmon. "
,,,,,I personally like the simple mac and cheese better.
,,,,,"The 8 oz is a perfect amount for one person to finish, thought the price was little high for the portion."
,,,,,"Must go to place for a chez loving individual, can't say no to a piping hot cup of Mac and Cheese while enjoying the Pike Place Market atmosphere~"
,,,,,Fourth visit to Seattle and it was my first time trying this place out with my partner. He really wanted to eat at this place and I am hyped to try any delicious restaurant as foodies.
,,,,,"We ordered the Flagship, Basil and Tomato Sandwich, Tomato Flagship Soup, and World's Best Mac and Cheese small."
,,,,,We were able to snag seats near the large vats of cheese being produced. The food was delicious. Everything was very savory and paired quite well together. I can most certainly understand why there is a lengthy line outside of the entrance. The line goes by rather quickly and is worth every bite.
,,,,,Another one of our go to place in Seattle Pike place Market area!!
,,,,,"Usually a 5star place - disappointed that they discontinued the spicy, vegetarian Mac and cheese they previously had :("
,,,,,Lasagna (new item for us) was ok-ish.
,,,,,Tomato soup and mac n cheese were yumm!!
,,,,,"Saw this place on quite a few places to try in Seattle and I've been craving Mac & Cheese, so this was perfect. "
,,,,,"Got half original because ""world's best"" and half of their mariachi. While the original was good, I wouldn't go and call it the ""world's best."" If anything, their mariachi one was way better since it had more flavors mixed in and a bit of a kick. I kind of wanted to get a full cup of that one, but I knew I shouldn't if I wanted to try as much as I can when visiting. If I were to visit Seattle again though, I wouldn't mind grabbing another cup."
,,,,,"We grabbed a quick bite here of Mac n Cheese, and walked down the street to a little park to enjoy it in the sunshine. The cheese is awesome. I've had it before at SeaTac airport, and it really is very good. My kids enjoyed it, and they are tough critics for Mac."
,,,,,"Protip: If you can't stop by here, grab it in the airport, or at T-Mobile Park at a Mariners game.UsefulFunnyCool"

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"The mac n cheese is phenominal and their shop in the market has lots of other great ways of using their cheese like grilled cheese, tuna melt, other sandwiches, cheese curds, meat and cheese platters etc.  Love being able to watch them make the cheese in the window!"
,,,,,"The first time I had Beecher's cheese was actually at a winery In Woodinville, but I'm so glad I made it here and waited in line for the Mac and cheese. It really is a cup of heaven and the cheese sauce tastes like it should. Like cheese. Really good cheese."
,,,,,Beecher's is a must go to if you're in Seattle. We got the the original Mac and cheese and the flagship grilled cheese and after we were done we were wanting more. The wait was short and the food was amazing. The Mac was flavorful and creamy. The grilled cheese was crispy and amazing. Definitely a place to try.
,,,,,"I wouldn't call myself a cheese guy, nor would I call myself a Mac and cheese guy, but I totally understand why this place is so revered."
,,,,,"I didn't spend an extended amount of time here, as I just made it a stop on my Pike's Place checklist, but in this pandemic world I was fairly in-and-out of this line."
,,,,,"It always helps to know what you want.  I ended up getting their grilled cheese along with their Mac and cheese, and both were really good.  My personal grilled cheese is better (as I'm sure a lot of people will say about their personal recipes), but this one was definitely solid.  The tomato and stuff added to the flavor to the perfectly toasted bread.  The Mac and cheese was also good.  I'm not particularly a Mac and cheese fan, but I was more than satisfied with the sample order I purchased."
,,,,,"This is also a stop at one of the Pikes Place Foodie Tours, and it's a solid one.  Definitely check this place out especially if you're really all about the cheese."
,,,,,"One of the most highly recommended spots I was told to check out during my Seattle trip was Beechers, and it definitely lived up to the hype! While it's hard to find something special or unique about a grilled cheese sandwich and macaroni and cheese, Beechers definitely raises the bar. Despite not being a super huge fan of cheese, I definitely had an appreciation for the ""stinky cheese"" flavor of their Mac and cheese and their absolutely perfect, no frills grilled cheese."
,,,,,F O O D
,,,,,"Flagship Grilled Cheese ($9.49) // Every element of this sandwich was executed to perfection--the cheese pull, the fresh tomato and basil, and the crisp yet soft bread. My only complaint is that I would've liked a few more pieces of basil because it complemented their housemade cheese so well! Otherwise, this is a grilled cheese done right!"
,,,,,"Breadzel ($4.99) // It could be that I enjoyed this breadzel an hour or so after I bought it, but it was very underwhelming--especially when compared to their Mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwich. The flavor just wasn't quite there, and the bread was tougher than I would've liked, but perhaps it's just something that's meant to be enjoyed fresh! Long story short, not my favorite and probably wouldn't recommend when you can indulge in other delicious items here. "
,,,,,"""World's Best"" Mac and Cheese ($6.99) // Not sure if this is deserving of the actual title of ""world's best,"" but I can definitely see it ranked up there! Toss away your memories of eating Kraft Mac and cheese because this is next level. If you're not fond of the stinky cheese flavor, then this may not be for you but it's still definitely worth a try! I'll admit that it took me a couple of bites to get used to the stinky cheese taste of it, but afterwards I was hooked! It's so creamy and delicious and worth the hype!"
,,,,,S E R V I C E
,,,,,"The workers here are so friendly despite being SO SWAMPED! They had an upbeat attitude both times that I went. My order was taken by the same woman on both days that I stopped by, and she even remembered me despite our brief encounter just the day before! You really can't beat care and attention like that."
,,,,,"Look, I was craving Beecher's, so I drove and 1hr 45 min to the ferry, waited for the ferry for 3 hours, rode the ferry for an additional 45 min, walked 15 min, just to get that mac and cheese  and a Sammie, to say it's good is an understatement. I could eat this everyday for the rest of my life, and when I die at 600 pounds of congestive heart failure, my last request would be one last trip to beechers"
,,,,,"Picked up some mac & cheese for a Pike Place Market picnic we were doing. It was super fast and easy, no line at all. They might've JUST opened up though. "
,,,,,"The Mac & Cheese was pretty good and a unique flavor. I wouldn't say it was the best mac I've ever had but it's worth a try! Also ours got a bit cold before we ate it, so that might've affected it. "
,,,,,"Either way, I would still give it a try :)"
,,,,,The cheese was very rich and salty. I'd get the kimichi melt instead of the flagship grilled sandwich if I could choose again.
,,,,,There is a line out the door. I thought homemade cheese and a baguette would be a perfect breakfast in the morning. But they have a full menu and people lined up for lunch. Very cool to see them making fresh ricotta in the window.
,,,,,"Beecher's is one of those places I've wanted to try, but haven't had the time (or patience) to wait in the lengthy line for. Like so many, Beecher's is still open and following the local COVID safety guidelines. "
,,,,,"I happened to be in the area on a rainy day, and seeing there was barely a line decided it was finally time to see if it lived up to the hype. "
,,,,,And. It. Did.
,,,,,"I had to go with the 3 popular items: mac & cheese, tomato soup, and their grilled cheese. Darting home with the goods secured, I jumped into the mac & cheese first. Creamy, a slightly spicy kick, and filled to the brim I was happy I went with their large option ($11.49) so I could have leftovers. If you're thinking of trying their tomato soup or their grilled cheese (original or any variance), I strongly recommend pairing them. "
,,,,,"A stringy grilled cheese is always fun, but there's something satisfying about dipping that cheesy sandwich in tomato soup to really round out the experience. Plus, with the grilled cheese leaning towards the salty side, the soup provides a nice balance."
,,,,,"Now that I'm ""in the know"", Beecher's will definitely be a rainy day comfort food favorite."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"*Open for take-out Jan. 2020, good Covid precaution*"
,,,,,Tip: Avoid the weekend crowd if you can
,,,,,"Located right across Pike Place Market, this cheesemaker is another must visit for tourists. In addition to a great selection of cheese, I also like the Mac & Cheese and spreads (good in sandwich or as a dip) . I tried the Cheese Curds with Hugarian Pepper this time - it was not too spicy. I have to say, the cheese curds were not as squeaky as I remembered from a while back, and a bit too salty. "
,,,,,"Also, it's always fun to see cheese being made next door."
,,,,,"Wow! I can definitely tell you that this place is worth the hype! They are efficient and their mac and cheese is delicious! The creaminess of the sauce is in every bite and just melts in your mouth. It's not overbearing at all. They sell other food items as well, and I definitely will go back and try more of their items!"
,,,,,WOW!!! Amazing Mac and cheese with smoked salmon! New item since I was last there pre Covid and reminded me how much I have missed them !!! 
,,,,,Must visit location if you're in the area!
,,,,,"This spot ALWAYS has such a long line but luckily I went at 4 pm and hurray! No line!!  I ordered the grilled cheese, tuna melt, tomato soup, and mac n cheese. Everything was good but hands down my favorite is the mac n cheese!!! It almost tastes like a creamy pasta with how creamy the cheese is!! "
,,,,,100% I'd come back just for the mac n cheese. (P.s I love mac n cheese with tabasco and ate this one with some as well :) )
,,,,,"I really wanted this to be magical. It was good, just not magical. "
,,,,,The Mac and cheese is tasty in that the cheese has a nice sour bite to it. But the pasta itself was alright -- wish it had been a bit more al dente. And the texture of cheese was kinda gritty instead of being smooth. 4/5
,,,,,"Got the original grilled cheese. Was tasty. Nicely grilled bread with tomato, basil and cheese inside. Could have used a bit more cheese. I'd say this was better than the Mac and cheese. 4.25/5."
,,,,,"As a self proclaimed mac & cheese expert, you MUST make this a stop when visiting Pike's Market. Is it a tourist destination? Yes. Is there a line? Yes. But I encourage you to wait it out because the line moves quickly and you won't regret it. Not only will everything they make melt in your mouth releasing the most endorphins your brain has ever made, but this business was opened because the owner ""felt passionately about eating food free of harmful additives and preservatives. That's why everything they produce, from the handcrafted cheeses to the delicious side dishes and crackers, is authentic, original, full-flavored food made with ingredients they trust and are proud of."" That's some carbs you can feel good about eating! Don't trust their word for it? That's okay because you can watch them at work making the cheese from a huge window that faces the street. "
,,,,,"Now for food recommendations - Get the 16oz world's best mac and cheese, because let's be real, once you dig in the 8oz won't be enough. I also got the chicken and mama lil's cheese sandwich. All absolutely mouthwatering. Clear your schedule for lunch and head to Beecher's for some amazing comfort food."
,,,,,"Of all the food spots we tried in Seattle during our visit, Beecher's was the most underwhelming. "
,,,,,"Since we were traveling, we did not try any of their fresh cheeses or curds - I think this is where we went wrong. We kept it simple with the breadzel and flagship grilled cheese. The breadzel tasted really dry and like it had been made days before. Thankfully, the grilled cheese was better and I felt like I could actually taste their cheese, which was nutty and rich. "
,,,,,"Ultimately, I think there are more interesting places to stop - unless you can actually take advantage of their fresh stuff!"
,,,,,"Okay I wouldn't call their Mac and cheese ""mac and cheese"" but it's good "
,,,,,"We got the original and salmon mac and cheese. Although I don't like seafood much, I actually enjoyed the salmon one more!! It's very flavorful. I'm sure there's dill and lemon zest in it or something  "
,,,,,The original is good. Rich and creamy! But I was a little flat. 
,,,,,There's two lines! One for ordering cheese and another for hot foods. It goes by fast so don't worry!
,,,,,There's also a window you can sit outside of and watch them make cheese curds
,,,,,"Hands down the best Mac n cheese I had!!! And there grilled cheese!! Wow! So good! I'm definitely coming back to this place and taking my family next time I visit, customer service was great super nice ! But there is a long line but it's worth the wait!"
,,,,,Beecher's is one of the most popular storefronts in Pike Place Market. 
,,,,,They are known for their handmade cheeses and hot foods & sandwiches. 
,,,,,"Since we were traveling, we skipped out on purchasing the actual cheeses, but did take advantage of the hot foods featuring the handmade cheeses."
,,,,,We ordered the following items:
,,,,,"""World's Best"" Mac and Cheese: Mac and cheese was creamy and had a smokey flavor. Pasta was Al dented and beschemel sauce was cheesy without being overly cheesy. Not the best Mac and cheese I've had, but it hit the spot. 3/5"
,,,,,"Smoked Turkey Sandwich: Sandwich had smoked turkey, Beecher's cheese, and Beecher's sauce. Bread was toasted, decent sandwich. 3/5"
,,,,,"Breadzel: UofW developed grain bread with Beecher's cheese, garlic, and crushed pepper. Served toasted and warm. Bread had a very strange, gritty texture. Very oily, would not recommend. 1/5"
,,,,,"All in all, Beechers is worth a try if you are in the Seattle area. Was just OK."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We only tried the mac and cheese, but it was really good! Their cheese has a nutty, cheddary taste to it. I'd like to go back to try some other items on their menu. "
,,,,,"The only thing I would suggest is to be wary that the sign outside of their store has prices that do not match what you're actually charged (see photos). The sign outside said the 8oz mac and cheese was $6.99, but when we got to the cashier, they charged us $7.49. We told him that the sign outside had a different price posted, but he just shrugged and said that sign was outdated. It's a misleading business practice and is the reason for one star taken off."
,,,,,"Hands down, the best Mac and cheese I've ever had!! "
,,,,,"I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan, but I mainly tried this place out because of the raving reviews I'd heard. The mac and cheese was so good - and so filling. I got the smaller size and I was so full after eating it. The cheese is just perfect and so tasty and everything was perfectly cooked. "
,,,,,"I also tried the kimchi cheese sandwich - would recommend because it's so unique and worth trying once, but I don't think I would get it a second time. "
,,,,,"The line to enter was pretty long but service is super quick. It's not really a sit down and chill kinda place, but more of a quick eat and leave place."
,,,,,"I admit I came to Beecher's because everyone on Tiktok had it on their list of foods to try at Pike Place. I love all things cheese so I knew I had to make a stop at Beecher's. We came by on a Sunday afternoon and the line only took about 5 minutes. We got a small mac & cheese and wow! Probably one of the best ones I've had. It was so creamy and velvety. It was spiced perfectly and had just the right amount of kick for mac&cheese. It's a little pricey but I feel like for the quality, experience, and location, it's standard. My only regret is not coming back for their smoked salmon mac&cheese."
,,,,,"As a pikes place must try, we came over to beecher's! With COVID, the lines weren't long for a Saturday morning with beautiful weather and we easily got to the front pretty quickly. "
,,,,,"We ordered a small smoked salmon mac and cheese and at first the zesty lemon and dill threw me off. I never had Mac and cheese with those flavors, but once I kept digging more in and eating, it just got better! The saltiness of the smoked salmon flavors helped balance the zesty. I wish it was a bit cheesier.. I love my Mac n cheese to have a good cheese pull from all the extra cheese.. but other than that it was great!"
,,,,,OMG if you come to Seattle you gotta come to beechers !! The Mac and cheese trust me the wait is worth it and don't forget to try out there grilled cheese with the tomato  soup . PERFECT combo !!!
,,,,,Heard Beecher's was a must try in Seattle for those visiting. We went to Beecher's to grab their Mac and cheese and had to wait about 10-15 minutes in the afternoon. 
,,,,,"The location itself is actually really cool, as you can see the process of the workers making the actual cheese through a glass window. Here's our thoughts on the items we tasted "
,,,,,Mac n cheese:
,,,,,"The quality of the cheese was amazing. It was velvety with a bit of a kick to it (it was pepper jack). By the time we managed to find seating I pikes place the penne pasta was a bit soggy, so for those who are planning to wait in line I would definitely get something more portable like a grilled cheese instead."
,,,,,Grilled cheese (flagship):
,,,,,"We tried this at the airport before leaving Seattle and oh my god it was amazing. The bread was toasted perfectly and the cheese was piping hot and had an amazing cheese pull as a result. In addition, they have tomatoes and basil which helps cut the heaviness of the cheese with the acidity of the tomatoes and makes it more fresh. Definitely would buy the flagship again if I was in town."
,,,,,"What's not to love about Beecher's? I stopped here because of the line out front and figured I should get in line and see what all of the fuss was about. I hear that the mac and cheese is what you ""should"" order, but I'm a grilled cheese kind of gal so I ordered that with a cup of tomato soup. When the woman at the register asked me if I wanted croutons and cheese on my soup, I kind of already felt like I'd hit the jackpot. It was everything I had hoped for and then some, and is the perfect lunch for Seattle weather. "
,,,,,I went back the next day just to buy the cheese to take home with me. I was happy to find out that I can purchase Beecher's cheese at home in a few local markets (and already have).
,,,,,"This review is based off my one and only experience at Beecher's. I've passed by the shop numerous times drawn to the sight of their ginormous, oddly satisfying cheese vat displayed for passers-by. Today, I finally braved the long line to try their so-called ""World's Best"" Mac & Cheese (Flagship, Just Jack, penne pasta and spices, $6.99 for 8 oz) and grab some cheeses for home. "
,,,,,"I love how the food and cheese lines are separated to allow a quicker flow. Despite long lines and I was in and out with my food in less than 10 minutes. I gotta say, I was disappointed with the Mac and cheese. I just didn't think it was all that great. It's definitely less creamy than it looks. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means. I just don't agree it's all that hyped up to be. But it's worth trying once! "
,,,,,"On the other hand, I LOVE my cheeses I brought home. It's been a challenge not to eat them all in one sitting! Marco Polo (cracked green and black peppercorn blended into creamy cheese, $12.00 for approx. 7 oz.) was by far my favorite! So good, so worth the price! Packed with flavor and freshness, this is one of the best cheeses I've ever had. SheepSheep ($25.00 for approx. 7 oz) was very unique, definitely different than any cheese I've ever tasted. Think earthy + fruity blended into creamy fresh cheese that melts in your mouth. "
,,,,,"I'd definitely grab more cheese next time I'm a Pikes, or I just may succumb to my cravings and order more online. I'll also give their food another shot, hopefully be able to upgrade this to 5 stars!"
,,,,,"We came for the Mac and cheese and went with the smoked salmon as it was something different. My husband called it more of a pasta dish than mac and cheese. It was very rich, with nice sized chunks of smoked salmon pieces. Thankfully this location in Pike Place Market had no line compared to the likes of Le Panier and Piroshky Piroshky."
,,,,,They claim to have the best mac and cheese in the world. I got a small order of the mac and cheese and it didn't disappoint me. Was it the best I've ever had? No. It was very cheesy and everything was cooked perfectly. It's some of the best I've had in my life. If you are a mac and cheese lover you have to give Beecher's a try if you are near by.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I had to stop here for their Mac and cheese. If I didn't want to eat so many things I would've gotten their cheese curd lasagna. The Mac and cheese was tasty. Was hoping for a crab one though.
,,,,,"I have been coming to this place for a long time, buying only cheeses and mac-n-cheese and never the sandwiches.  This time is no exception and they were as good as ever."
,,,,,"Of course this is a tourist's spot, but many local, like me, also frequent the place.  I am a bit surprised for the separation of foods to consume and cheeses to go, in terms of check-out setup.  I think they should redesign their foot traffic flow to make it easier.  I did not see free crackers and cheese samples anymore.  That's probably a COVID collateral."
,,,,,"If you have not, their mac-n-cheese is the best.  We tried to do the same at home and never duplicate the full flavors.  Also time your visit to avoid the crowd."
,,,,,Maybe just my hot take: but I thought the Mac & Cheese was ok. 
,,,,,"The cheese it self was very creamy and heavy, but I preferred something slightly lighter. Just the small filled me up though, and I think for a classic Seattle experience, it was worth it. "
,,,,,I do think that other places have done Mac 'n Cheese better though. Maybe it's just because I was raised on macaroni noodles in my mac n cheese. 
,,,,,Also bought the Bretzel to dip in the Mac & Cheese which was an absolute delight. It helped soak up the cheesiness and could help make it into a mini dip.
,,,,,"I've tried the ""World Famous Mac"" as well as the ""Grilled Cheese"". Both were okay in my opinion. What really wins my heart over and over are the in-house cheeses! You really can't go wrong with anything. TJ's who???? My favorites are: "
,,,,,"""Smoked"": apple/cherrywood smoked creaminess. I typically don't enjoy smoked cheese flavor but the creaminess of this is really enjoyable. The smoke flavor is very upfront. Right at the end you'll get the quick tartness of the apple smoke. 5/5"
,,,,,"""Flagship"": robust, semi-hard but crumbly, nutty with little crystallized buttery brown bits. This may be one of the best cheeses I've ever had, my fridge is never without it. 5/5"
,,,,,"""4 Year Aged Flagship"": sharp and buttery ... this is a slightly crumbly cheese with a bit of fruitiness at the end. 5/5"
,,,,,"""Cheese sticks"": noooo not your typical cheesy/processed/pull-apart shreddable texture. This is more of a bite-off-a-tiny-piece-at-a-time dreamy creamy texture. 5/5 "
,,,,,"""Fresh curds"": these are a great snack to have with some apples and olives or bread sticks, but for me personally it's an acquired liking. The taste is a bit too pungent for me while the texture gives me a strange mouthfeel. 3/5"
,,,,,"There is a separate line for pre-packaged shop items and a separate line for hot food items. Most entrees take about 8 minutes. For all cheese lovers & lactose tolerant people, it's definitely worth a try. And for lactose intolerant folks, it's prob worth it too honestly :-)"
,,,,,Such a tiny corner restaurant that it was hard to spit out. Although we quickly learned the long lines lined up to their very store front. If you don't get here early expect to wait 30 minutes +. We had the original grilled cheese sandwich and kimchi grilled cheese. The meal itself is good. Not worth 30 minutes of a wait and an extra 20 mins to find a place to sit.
,,,,,"Beecher's is another infamous Seattle eatery I've read about here on Yelp. Like many others, they are located along the street in Pike Place between there and Post Alley close to the original Starbucks location."
,,,,,"They make their cheese in house as you can see in the picture below. Each day we passed by here they had a fresh giant batch of cheese being made. Some of my favorite restaurants in the area, including Pink Door and Old Stove, gets their cheese from here."
,,,,,We ordered a medium size of their house made Mac to split between us and it was delicious. It was right up there with some of the best mac I've ever eaten mainly due to the fact that the cheese was freshly made. It's a great place to grab a snack or meal to split. I highly recommend.
,,,,,COVID 
,,,,,"Fun to watch the cheese churning from outside, but the food menu is limited. Interesting to see kimchi and cheese in sandwich section. "
,,,,,"Tried Mac and cheese and smoke salmon Mac and cheese, it's ok but didn't wow me. The smoke salmon one has too much dill for me. The Mac and cheese is white cheese in penne pasta, not the semi circular tube macaroni pasta, which is a bit misfitting in my mind. "
,,,,,"The service on the deli section is good, you can ask and get explanations of their cheese, but it's not a wide selection."
,,,,,"This is a must visit for Mac & Cheese lovers in Seattle! The employees were all very friendly and service was quick since we only ordered the ""World's Best"" Mac & cheese (which was amazing). "
,,,,,You can also watch part of the cheese making process that happens on-site!
,,,,,"I had to make a stop to Beechers to try what I've heard is the best Mac and cheese ever (funny that I didn't know they have a location in NYC, but don't worry, I'll eat there next!)."
,,,,,"I must say, this Mac and cheese is REALLY REALLY good! You can tell there is love in their food, as this will send you straight into a cheesy bliss."
,,,,,"It is very heavy and filling (duh, it's Mac and cheese) so I couldn't eat the whole tub by myself but dang I wish I could. I still dream about this bite!"
,,,,,"It's my second favorite Mac and cheese of all time. There, I said it. "
,,,,,5/5
,,,,,Of course just came for the world famous Mac and cheese.
,,,,,BEST non ethnic Mac and cheese I've ever had. It's HARD eating Mac and cheese out because your use to your mother or grandmas recipe but this was surprisingly really good. 
,,,,,Watching the guy make the cheese was boring and exciting at the same time. 
,,,,,"I would for sure not skip this, share a small cup with your party. Worth it."

,,,,,"As many others in the area at Pike Place Market, this place had a long line, but SO WORTH IT. We had the World's Best Mac & Cheese to-go and mmmmmmm it was AMAZING. Thinking about it now makes me regret I didn't get more to take home on the flight with me."
,,,,,"We didn't get to try other items on the menu since we were trying many different food places in the area, but the other cheese dishes looked delicious."
,,,,,"Perhaps one of the funnest parts is they have a clear window views into their cheese-making process. We can see the employees do their thing and inside the store itself, they also have signs that lay out the steps of how they produce their cheese."
,,,,,Overall loved this place. Can't wait to go back.
,,,,,We made a beeline during a busy holiday weekend just to eat their famous Mac and cheese. 
,,,,,"They had so many different delicious options it was hard to choose from. Between their statement mac & cheese and amazing sandwiches along with their tomato soup, there's a little bit of something for everyone picnic style and all. "
,,,,,My first introduction to Beecher's cheese was  a little snack pack of cheese and crackers on an Alaska flight and ever since then their flag ship cheddar is something that cannot be ignored. I definitely saw them and it brought great nostalgia memories. 
,,,,,"Although, when I tried the salmon Mac and Cheese it wasn't anything that was mind blowing. Definitely yummy for the hungry individual, creamy chewy. And the brightness of the lemon and jalapeño was really well balanced. At the end of the day it wasn't my favorite Mac and cheese but I'm happy I got to try it."
,,,,,"I've been wanting to try this place for so long, and it was totally worth it. I got a small mac & cheese and it was so creamy and cheesy. I like that they had seasonal flavors too."
,,,,,"My friend got the breadzel, however she didn't like it and ended up tossing it. "
,,,,,What really impressed me was watching the cheesemakers at work through the glass. They were washing out the huge cheese tub and it was an incredible process to observe.
,,,,,"To be honest, I had passed Beecher's quite a few times and only stopped to watch them stir the tub as they made cheese. (Cheese curds?) Pikes Market is almost like an ant farm the time of day we've gone, and my need to rush everywhere always fights me to not stay in line. "
,,,,,"Tuna melt? Yes! Not the regular tuna melt you'd get in a restaurant. This actually taste like tuna. The fish! From the ocean! Not a can. lol I'm use to the can's non fishy taste, so this shocked my taste buds, in a good way. "
,,,,,"Anyways. Mac and cheese? Yaaaaas. Delicious. Creamy. Light cheese sauce. Pasta on point. Amazing. Definitely try it! But don't eat it outside in the wind, unless you want it to harden up. As cheese does when it becomes cold. lol"
,,,,,"The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because of the service I received from the young girl taking my order. After waiting in line for what seemed like forever, she was so rude. I have a bit of a hearing problem, people talking everywhere, and even with me leaning in to talk to her, she still loudly called out, ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!"" In the most irritated voice, followed by the 'eat ' look, and an eye roll. "
,,,,,"So I know I adjust my voice as loud as I feel I need to, because like I said, I have a hearing problem, but I can't help but wonder if this young lady acts this way towards EVERYONE with a disability? Hmm. "
,,,,,"Anyways, no need to holler at me at me young girl, and there's especially no need for your angry, annoyed looks. Let the sun shine in, and if you don't like people, stop working the front of the store.  "
,,,,,"The tuna melt, go get it! The Mac and cheese, you'll inhale it! Cheers and enjoy the wonderful food!"
,,,,,"Came here for the mac and cheese and was unfortunately not super wowed by it :( Maybe I just came on a bad day? The pasta was very soft and not particularly super hot either, so the cheese tasted really heavy and thick on the noodles. It was also really salty."
,,,,,I think it is still worth visiting to watch them make the cheese in the windows though and maybe sample some other items if you are huge cheese fan. Unfortunately this one fell short for me but maybe it won't for you!
,,,,,I tend to stop here whenever I'm in the area and get a small cup of their mac n cheese. There's a slight hint of spice that is so delicious. It's so cheesy and goes well with the bread they offer too. 
,,,,,"I also get the to go containers of cheese curds, or the Mac n cheese kit. Homemade cheese and the customer service is awesome!"
,,,,,"Being able to watch the cheese made fresh in front of you is amazing! But the foot traffic is crazy! Especially in the rain. The Mac and cheese is super rich, too rich for my taste. And costed too much for a small cup of it..."
,,,,,The line was kind of long but the wait was not. The food was super good the grilled cheese and mac & cheese is amazing. They have all sorts of fun cheeses to buy. I would definitely go again.
,,,,,This is a COVID-era review.
,,,,,"There will be a line on a weekend, but it'll go by quickly since everything has been prepared already."
,,,,,Tried the regular mac and cheese as well as the salmon mac and cheese.
,,,,,Both definitely live up to the hype of cheesiness!
,,,,,"For the regular, it's pure in flavor and seasoned well."
,,,,,"For the salmon, I was really impressed with the amount of salmon and slight spice. I was pleasantly surprised!"
,,,,,"You probably can't eat over there, but it's super easy to eat."
,,,,,Location is very convenient too.
,,,,,Hands down the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Even my husband who hates Mac and cheese gives his seal of approval. Their cheese is on a whole different level. It's a mandatory stop if you're ever in the area.
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,One of the creamist mac and cheeses I've ever had! Suggest eating this with a blander food or alongside water though as it is quite salty
,,,,,Great stop for a quick cheesy bite!
,,,,,Wait was less than 10 min and the staff is super friendly! You can wait by the pickup counter or go to the corner and watch the cheese being made.
,,,,,"My picture only shows half the sandwich because I was very hungry and I ate the other half before I took the picture. The bread had a great crunch with the gooey cheese, their sauce and tomato. It was $11, but worth it."
,,,,,I can't wait to go back and try the mac and cheese!
,,,,,"Every time I'm in town, Beecher's is a spot I definitely need to visit. The mac and cheese here is incredible, and it's become tradition to grab a bowl and just eat it on the sidewalk. I simply can't wait a moment to devour it."
,,,,,"Overall, I thought that Beecher's ""World's Best"" Mac and Cheese was overhyped. The flavor of the cheese was decent, but its consistency was too runny for my liking. The pasta itself, which was penne and not macaroni, was quite mushy. Personally, I would've preferred it to be al dente with a bit of a bite."
,,,,,I'd avoid this place as it's not worth the long queue!
,,,,,I am so depressed I don't live right there so I can go everyday. The line is long but it moves very quickly - grab a frozen apple juice while you wait for your grilled cheese. There's nowhere to eat you just walk up and order. You won't be disappointed if you like grilled cheese I PROMISE !
,,,,,Wouldn't say Worlds Best mac and cheese really is the worlds best but it's decent. Very rich and very cheesy. The texture wasn't spot on for me though. The warm mac and cheese did taste good though since the weather was cold!
,,,,,God damn. BELIEVE IN THE HYPE!! They literally have the worlds best mac and cheese. Do your self the favor and upgrade to the large. I was skeptical especially since they serve their mac and cheese penne pasta (not a huge fan) but it really works! Grilled cheese and tomato was bomb dot com. Only wished i got the tomato soup to pair with the sandwich. Overall great experience. Friendly staff and very knowledgeable about their product. Would recommend this place to anyone!
,,,,,"Food (5/5) : The cheesy, creamy, delicious original mac & cheese is a MUST EAT!! I love coming to the market and getting a bowl of mac & cheese. "
,,,,,"Service (5/5): The service was quick and easy. Yes, there is a long line but the wait is not super long (approximate 10-15 minutes)"
,,,,,Parking (2/5): Street parking close to the market is very hard to find and you only have 2 hours at the market which personally is not enough time to truly explore the food and overall market. I recommend parking in the pacific place garage and walking 10 minutes to the market.  
,,,,,TIP #1: Make sure you are in the line to buy hot food like mac & cheese. There is another line for buying cheeses such as cheese curds.

,,,,,"While in Seattle you should visit Beecher's Handmade Cheese next to Pike Place Market on the corner of Pike and Pine!  If you're a Mac an Cheese lover you will definitely appreciate this spot!  We ordered the Smoked Salmon Mac n Cheese and it was ""The Best"" I've ever tasted!  No lie, hands down!  Something about the quality of cheese and smokiness that makes this cheese so amazing!  "
,,,,,"Look up Beecher's and you will find several locations in different states!  I'll really need to research them while I'm back home in Florida because this quality cannot be duplicated!  The service was amazing too and of course, location is always amazing right next to Pike Place Market!  I recommend to any cheese lover!"
,,,,,"this place was YUMMY!! we went all out and got their mac n cheese, grilled cheese, and breadzel. I wasn't crazy about the breadzel or the wait but still worth it! And I would definitely get the soup or something else to pair with all the cheese :)"
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We went here on Tuesday around 3:30pm last week and there was about a 25 minute wait. I've heard a lot of good things about the mac and cheese at this place, so I was curious and decided to try it!"
,,,,,"We ordered the ""World's Best"" Mac & Cheese, Flagship Sandwich, Chicken Mama Lil's & Arugula Sandwich, and a Breadzel. The ""World's Best"" Mac & Cheese was very good, cheesy, and creamy! The sandwiches and the breadzel wasn't as great. All of the bread items were very dry and hard which isn't something I'm a fan of. I got tired of eating it and felt like they needed to add some type of sauce to the sandwiches to make it better."
,,,,,"I'd recommend this place ONLY for the mac and cheese! I liked how flavorful it was and I would order the mac and cheese again. They also sell lasagna here, so maybe I'll give their lasagna a try next time."
,,,,,"I tried both original and smoked salmon Mac & Cheese. I will definitely get the original one again, but probably not Salmon one. I am glad I tried both, but Salmon one was too salty and tasted a lot of herbs)."
,,,,,We always love to visit Beecher's first when we get to Seattle! Their cheese is so so good and I absolutely love their mac and cheese! (this is saying a lot coming from a Wisconsin girl who loves her cheese!)
,,,,,Their store is very well organized and the line moves fast. They have food prepared already so they can just dish you up what you want quickly and keep the line moving. 
,,,,,We also love watching the cheese get made at Beecher's. It seems like a bit of a local attraction people are always by the window watching it get made. So fun!
,,,,,"This was one of our first stops and very easily located within Pike Place Market. Because it's one of the ""must stop places"" it is overpriced in my opinion. We got a cup for $8 and I expected a lot but it was okay. They use just your basic penne pasta, holds okay cheese but the cheese was more on the runny side. I'm from the south so I feel like I am a fair judge when it comes to mac and cheese. "
,,,,,"If you like a not too runny but not too thick that hangs on the pasta, then you can probably reconsider if the line is too long, you can definitely save your money. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was decent but I don't think it's worth the money for a cup. There is also a deli attached so you can try something else like the grilled cheese that features the famous Beecher's Handmade Cheese."
,,,,,"Just about everyone that has been to or from Seattle that we spoke to, told us this was a must to come try. The line around the block also attests to this being a top go to place. "
,,,,,"Both the hubs and I got a sandwich- me the flagship and turkey for him plus a small side of Mac and cheese. Hands down the Mac and cheese was the best of the bunch. Ridiculously creamy with a little bit of spice, this was so good. "
,,,,,My sandwich was tasty with nice tomato slices (not the mealy offerings so commonly used) and basil. I also tried a bite of the hubs which was very good too. 
,,,,,Service was fast and friendly and those employees hustle!
,,,,,Soo yummy and worth it if you like Mac n cheese. The line was never too long. It's a tad pricey but it actually tastes good and is not a gimmick. Go here. Get cheese curds and make a grilled cheese!
,,,,,"I was visiting my husband who is stationed in Bremerton, Washington so we had to go to the infamous Pike Place Market so I took him here since they have the best macaroni and cheese ever on this planet! We both absolutely love the consistency that never fails and it is so spectacular to watch the cheese in the making while you are waiting in the long line that moves very quickly. I have not yet tried their sandwiches and cheese curds but I will definitely do that the next time that I am in Seattle, Washington. They also sell this Mac & cheese in the frozen section of Costco and I believe the airport has a beecher's handmade cheese restaurant too. We shared a small cup and I was pretty mad we didn't get the biggest one because we both devoured it in seconds!"
,,,,,"I bought their Flagship and Smoked Flagship cheeses to eat as charcuterie and fondue and they were really good. You definitely taste the smokiness on the Smoked Flagship. I did try their famous mac and cheese, but it was too rich and thick for my tastes. I'd rather melt down their cheese for some fondue!"
,,,,,"Pro tip, if you don't care about the ambience, come at night like an hour or two before close. You won't have to wait in line and sometimes you can catch the sunset or a nighttime rainy view of the fluorescent public market signs. The cheeses are amazing!!! Grab the flagship, even eating it plain is delicious. They have it in cheese stick form too! The employees were super helpful for picking and pairing cheeses for a charcuterie board. They spent a lot of time helping us while the delicious grilled cheese was being made. It lives up to the hype and anything you get here is delicious! If you need help, the employees are amazing at recommendations!"
,,,,,"I do not like Mac and cheese a lot, but I will ALWAYS go to this place to pick some up! I got the smoked salmon Mac and cheese and it was truly delicious and flavorful. There are so many different types of cheeses that give it an elevated taste, accompanied with the smoked salmon...ahh to die for! Sad that it isn't in Colorado otherwise I would be coming all the time."
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"A friend told me about this place and said they have great mac & cheese. She is right! It's so creamy and has a nice flavor to it! I also picked up a Breadzel - basically a cheese bread, but I loved the flavor combo and texture of the bread. I got there kind of early in the day so I wasn't very hungry, but if you are every wanting a sandwich for lunch, this place has some awesome looking sandwiches on the menu - even a kimchi grilled cheese! The lasagna also sounds amazing.  "
,,,,,"I loved watching the cheese makers at work through the window. I only wish I could've purchased some cheese to take home, but I don't think it would've lasted my flight home. I just have to find a local market by me that sells this cheese so I can try more varieties!"
,,,,,Still a must hit spot. I tried the salmon mac and cheese this time and it was freaking delicious!! Maybe even better than the regular mac and cheese!! That's saying a lot. So good!!!!!!
,,,,,I would go to this spot on non-peak times because the line at this place can get nutso! It's a definite must hit when you are at Pike Place Market though... The mac and cheese is so delicious! That beschamel sauce is freakin' amazing. 
,,,,,I looooooooooooooooved it. 
,,,,,"However, I do have to say that the seating here is atrocious. There's not much seating so you have to wander around with your noodle-y goodness. Not that I mind."
,,,,,"Any item off the menu here is worth waiting 20 minutes in line at Pike's Place Market crowd. While waiting, you can see how they make all their cheese thru the floor-to-ceiling windows. The service is super quick; you will be in and out within a few minutes. The inside of the restaurant is crowded and has less seating but is really clean. "
,,,,,"I tried both the Mac and Cheese's, The World Famous, and the Salmon one. They were both mind-blowing. The cheese was so unique and flavorful that I could eat it for days. It was a blend that I had never had before. The pasta was well cooked, and everything came together really well in the bowl. The salmon one was equally insane. The cheese was different than the World's Famous, and it went better with the salmon. The chunks were well cooked and tender. It was a perfect cup!"
,,,,,"They have a location in Bellevue too, but I would recommend going to this one. They have fresher cheese and feel more authentic. "
,,,,,I would highly recommend someone to go here and take tourists visiting the area to stop by here. 
,,,,,It is a one of a kinda Mac and Cheese! A solid 5/5
,,,,,"It feels so good to be back traveling. After 17 months, we finally felt comfortable to hop on an airplane again. "
,,,,,"When in Seattle, Beecher's is always a good idea (unless you're lactose intolerant?). I absolutely love their mac and cheese. It is penne pasta with loads of melted cheese and a pinch of chili flakes. I remember grabbing another one for the flight home the first time we went. But now, their frozen packs are being made widely available, they are being sold at Whole foods, Sprouts, and sometimes Costco. "
,,,,,"For this trip, aside from the mac, I decided to try the grilled cheese. They use their Flagship cheese and Just Jack on toasted wheat bread. It is not as cheesy as I imagined it would be but it was decent. "
,,,,,P.S. Samples are NOT back yet.
,,,,,"To be honest? Beecher's is overhyped. ""World's best"" is a broken record statement. "
,,,,,"The line is usually long because this place is named an iconic spot to try at Pike Place Market. I love cheese A LOT but the Mac and Cheese is just okay here. The pasta is overcooked and beyond softer than al dente. The cheese consistency is a bit runny, only coating your penne. Maybe I came on an off day, but for $8 in a small cup, I was expecting a little more. The menu is limited and there are different cheese curds you can purchase. "
,,,,,"Try it yourself if you're at Pike Place, but don't beat yourself up if you aren't able to try it."
,,,,,A must try in pike market where you can taste the creamy cheese with spaghetti and watch how these dairy come to product 
,,,,,But the price is a little bit too much for a small cup and it's so much in flavor by the cream texture two can share one cup
,,,,,Forget my lactose intolerant! I saw someone pass by with the salmon Mac and cheese and it smelled so delicious. So I decided to get one to try.
,,,,,"For a small, about $10 you can get a smoked salmon Mac and cheese with bits of celery and dill. It was delicious. It's not too cheesy, so you can taste the pasta and salmon. Was not bland, had the right amount of seasoning, with the smoked salmon some parts were salty but blended well with the celery and dill. "
,,,,,"It's just something that you have to try when you're in the area. Touristy- yes, tasty- yes!"
,,,,,I can't really eat cheese without a stomach ache thanks to my lactose intolerant. But I got the sandwich instead and tried the mac n cheese during my food tour. I love their mac and cheese and would love it more if I could eat more than 3 bites. 
,,,,,"The sandwich on the other hand was good. They heat it up real hot for you too and the cheese gets all melted. One complaint, it needed more ham! There was like one thin slice. Well I guess this place is known for their cheesy side. They have a good variety of cheese too, a bit pricey though. If I had the dough and stomach, I'll buy some."
,,,,,"Located in the middle of Pike Place, it can get very busy, but don't let that dissuade you from going; it'll be worth it!"
,,,,,"They have a large window, so you could see how the cheese is freshly made! Keep in mind that there are two lines: one to order their famous macaroni and cheese and other foods and another line to buy blocks of cheese and crackers. My favorite cheese is Flagship cheese! It is one of the best tasting cheese I've ever tasted, wow!!!"
,,,,,"Visiting Seattle for the labor day week and this was one of the ""must eat"" places, so I couldn't skip out."
,,,,,"It's been years since I had a food Mac and Cheese, and my oh my this was just heavenly! "
,,,,,"What a smooth, silky and creamy sauce. And just the PERFECT amount of subtle spiciness. I was beyond impressed with this."
,,,,,Used that spoon to get every last bit of sauce off that bowl.
,,,,,Without a doubt the World's BEST Mac and Cheese!
,,,,,"Yum yummy, if you like cheese this is the place. Man nothing better then fresh made cheese. I had the Mac and cheese and the grilled cheese. Both was just delicious. "
,,,,,The Mac and cheese was just so cheesy and very good tasting. Also creamy. The grilled cheese was nicely grilled and crispy on the out and chewy in the middle. The cheese was just so good. 
,,,,,As I ate I was also watching them make more fresh cheese and would have loved a slice haha. 
,,,,,Place is not very big but service was fast and good. Friendly staff. Grilled cheese had to wait just a bit longer but as I waited I was eating the Mac and cheese. Will for sure be back again.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"The line here is constant. No matter what time of day, i found that the line fluctuated but always existed, but it moves a lot faster than it looks. Don't let the ""miserable line face"" fool you, it only takes a few minutes, they have it down to a science on move that line quickly."
,,,,,"The cheese is a perfect balance of savory, greasy, and a hint of stink."
,,,,,"Very cool place! Loved how they have a glass wall showing the cheese-making process! So cool! As for the mac n cheese, really good! My favorite was the salmon and dill Mac n cheese! Such a unique, fishy taste in a good way haha"
,,,,,Cheese-focused spot by Pike Place. Came here after visiting Piroshky Piroshky next door and grabbed a small mac & cheese to sample. We came around 10:30 so there was no line and we were able to snag seats on the jugs to watch them make cheese. Credit cards are accepted. They have products for sale in addition to being able to buy food to eat right then and there. 
,,,,,"The mac & cheese was delicious - the cheese was so rich and creamy. It kept well even later in the day, so eating eat fresh right then and there was a different experience entirely. It was fun watching the cheese process and they had a description of the entire process above the window. It's a must-try spot if you're around Pike Place."
,,,,,Come here for the mac and cheese. Nuff said. 
,,,,,COMPLETELY WORTH THE WAIT. Completely!!!!!
,,,,,"I would give 4.5 stars if I could because the food is good and it's really cool to watch them make the cheese so I'm glad we went, but it didn't quite live up to the hype. The Mac and cheese was just too cheesy, I got tired of eating it and no one in my group was in love with the sandwich they got. My recommendation would be go and have a small Mac and cheese as a snack while you watch them make the cheese, but don't make this a meal. Keep in mind the only seating is a couple small stools at a counter and if it's busy, they're full. Cool place to check out, I just wasn't as enthralled as other people seemed."
,,,,,"It was good, but I felt like it was way too creamy for my taste. I was just fine after like three bites and after three bites I did not want more. It was just way to heavy and creamy for me. However, if you are into that, then you would love it!"
,,,,,Yet another review in its 3000+ growing fandom! lol
,,,,,"The first time I had it, a friend recommended me the flagship basil tomato sandwich, which was okay -- I wasn't a huge fan. For first timers, the sandwich should not be the way to go to taste beecher's cheese. It was a decadent sandwich though. "
,,,,,Enjoyed the fresh tomatoes and basil. NO CHEESE PULL EITHER. 
,,,,,"The second time I came, I had their Mac and cheese, and smoked salmon Mac and cheese, lasagna, and their breadzel. "
,,,,,My friend got lured by that amazing smelll of breadzel (and it was right in front of us). It was just okay. I shared with 2 other friends and we each had a few bites. It wasn't worth it. The garlic smell is just a smell ): It's just bread.
,,,,,"The world famous Mac and cheese was definitely a hit for all of us. It had a delicious nutty-ish flavor, creamy and amazing!"
,,,,,"The smoked salmon was good too, but I think the salmon and dill taste was overwhelming and taking over the taste of the cheese. "
,,,,,"The lasagna was just a-ok. Just regular lasagna to me, nothing to write home about. "
,,,,,Three people shared all of this and it was a good filling snack while walking around Pike Place. 
,,,,,"The second time around, I was able to grab a few seats in front of their cheese making machine! Lots of giant blocks of cream and cheese mixing before my eyes! "
,,,,,"There are only about 10 (or less) seats in this location, so we had a wait for seats to open up. People ate and left, so the wait was not long. The metal milk jug shaped seats aren't hella comfortable, so its not a huge enticing thing to sit, unless youre sharing."
,,,,,"Honestly, I think Beecher's is all hype..."
,,,,,"While planning my recent trip to Seattle, Beecher's came highly recommended and being the foodie/Yelper that I am...I had to stop by! "
,,,,,"To begin, the guy behind the counter was not the friendliest. I'm obviously a tourists and trying to figure out what I want and he wasn't friendly when it came to greeting or helping. Hmmmm...we ordered a small ""world's best"" for $8.26 and honestly, it was not worth it. "
,,,,,We took about 3-5 bites each and we're not impressed. The cheese had an odd taste and I was not a fan of the texture - it was a bit grainy. 
,,,,,I think it's cool that they show you how the cheese is made through the glass window and the gal behind the counter talking about their different cheeses sounded very knowledgeable and friendly. It just wasn't worth the appraise for me...
,,,,,"I don't get what all the hype is about. This is like glorified Velveeta, which is good but it doesn't taste home made, just mass produced. It's apparently world famous but I wouldn't come here just because of that. I did get sucked in because of all the good reviews, maybe it's changed over time. The cashier defintiely seem rude. No one smiled, they actually didn't mask up half the time and the guy that took our order was so short with my friend. We had a big order and he cut him off thinking he was done but we had 3 more items to order. Gotta be kidding me. We got all their different grilled cheese and Mac and cheeses, it's nothing to rave about but it's defintiely not bad, just not world famous."
,,,,,"Yoooo. I know why my friend takes everyone here when they come down to Pikes. I have been twice now and both times we got a little bit different thing but everything was very good. I've had the grilled cheese sandwich, tomato soup, and mac & cheese. My top recommendation is the mac & cheese. It's made with penne pasta and a mix and cheeses and spices. It's gooey and delicious. I recommend the tomato soup without the croutons. They soak up too much of the soup. The grilled cheese takes a minute but is crisp and cheesy. Such a fun place to watch too. They make the cheese in a big thing... not sure what to call it but it's cool to watch. "
,,,,,Random thing: When I didn't finish all my mac  I put some queso from Jupiter bar on top and ate it when I got home... elevated it even more. WOW!
,,,,,1600 Pike Pl
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,Uhm what?! How good is their cheese? Sooo good! Snag that Mac & Cheese and try those delicious sandwiches too! I tried the Chicken Mama Lil's & Arugula sandwiches and it was deeeelicious! They don't have too many items on the menu but they are yummy. 
,,,,,"They also make cheese there so you can watch the process of cheese making. They used to have cheese samples as well, but they've taken that away probably due to COVID. There are some bar-type seatings facing the cheese making container but very limited, maybe 7 chairs."
,,,,,"Finally tried the ""world's best mac and cheese"" at Beecher's in Pike Place, Seattle! "
,,,,,"I got the small cup of plain mac and cheese (they also have salmon and dill mac and cheese). I got there around 9:45am and there was no line - when I walked by hours later, there was such a long line out the door so I definitely recommend coming earlier. The employees were very nice, too!"
,,,,,"I will say, for being titled the world's best mac and cheese and for everyone raving about Beecher's, I thought it would be a little better. It had a certain spice/kick to it that I haven't tasted from other mac and cheeses. The cheese also hardened rather quickly. It was still yummy, I just certainly had mac and cheeses that satisfied my taste buds more!"
,,,,,"Overall, I don't know if I would get it again, but I would recommend others to try it!"
,,,,,Beechers. Why are you not in Reno *sobs* 
,,,,,"As a die-hard cheese lover, Beechers is a slice of the afterlife. A whole smorgasbord of hot cheesy meals to choose from--eat them at the bar overlooking the cheese making workshop or to-go as you walk around Pike Place market--and of course  grab some of the many packaged options to take home! You can never go wrong with a classic Mac n cheese, or a grilled cheese and tomato soup! "
,,,,,"I really loved watching the whole cheese making process while I ate, and I loved the informational signs above the windows. I found myself with additional questions and wanted an intercom to press and communicate with the men and women hard at work, although I guess that wouldn't be an efficient use of their time!"
,,,,,"When I saw the words ""World's Best"" and ""cheese,"" I knew I had to check out Beecher's."
,,,,,The line wasn't too long at the time but it gets long and busy fast. Pretty cool to see them making cheese from the window.
,,,,,"I opted to try a small of the ""World's Best"" Mac & Cheese and a Breadzel."
,,,,,"The Mac & Cheese was good, but I think ""World's Best"" really overhyped it for me. I can taste the cheese but expected more! "
,,,,,"The Breadzel, I wasn't sure what to expect. Maybe I expected it to be more garlic, cheesy, soft pretzel-like. While the bread itself was good, it was heartier and breadier than I expected. Would have been great with their tomato soup, but at that point, I would just opt to try a Grilled Cheese."
,,,,,"Overall, not a bad experience. Just not as cheesy as I thought it would be! Glad I tried Beecher's, I'd love to try a Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup combo next time."
,,,,,"Had to try the mac & cheese here since a bunch of people rave about it. Maybe I'm just not a mac & cheese connoisseur but I thought it was alright. I tried appreciating all of the cheese flavor nuances but overall the ""world's best"" mac & cheese didn't really blow my mind. Also wished the cheese sauce was creamier."
,,,,,"If you're already at Pike Place stop by and give it a try if you're still curious (perhaps you'll like it much more than I did). The mac & cheese was tasty, but not so much that I would go out of my way for it."
,,,,,"Such a Seattle classic :) Located in Pike's Place, love the big window where you can see the cheese being made! It's a cheese shop and hot food bar in one with some bar seating."
,,,,,"Their mac n cheese ($8.50 for the small smoked salmon dill mac & cheese) definite airs on the creamy over gooey side, and they use penne. The breadzel ($5.5) is also yummy and served warm! I've tried a bunch of their cheese including the cheese curds, all great!"
,,,,,"Definitely worth a stop, especially if you're a cheese lover obviously!"
,,,,,"i'm a sucker for mac n' cheese, so this was definitely a spot i knew i had to hit in seattle. @beecherscheese has their mac n cheese recipe PERFECTED! The cheese is super flavorful and the noodles are cooked to a perfect al dente. i love that you can actually see the cheese being made and that they offer so many dishes to include their cheese. i def will have to try their lasagna and grilled cheese next! loved it so much that i went back for a second time! "
,,,,,"If you want to find a cheaper way to get beecher's, you can check out your local whole foods frozen aisle! although it's pricier compared to other instant mac, you can add some panko and bacon , serve it in a fancy dish, and fool anyone that it's homemade!!"
,,,,,Not the best Mac but good.
,,,,,Very tasty cheese.
,,,,,No line i got lucky.
,,,,,Its good to try but not to rave and die for like the reviews say.
,,,,,Get a small cup and buy some cheese.
,,,,,"Toddler did not like it Lol, its more of a grown up cheese"
,,,,,Cheese!! It is it's own food group! 
,,,,,"So many different flavors, types, etc. to choose from, it's like an endless array of yumminess."
,,,,,"I discovered Beecher's While I was wandering through Pike Place market Place, and noticed a line wrapped around the corner. Of course, curiosity got the best of me, and I needed to go check it out. "
,,,,,"Beechers offers a menu filled with scrumptious food offerings from their infamous mac & cheese, to their grilled cheese sandwiches that sound absolutely divine. Had I not just eaten, I absolutely wanted to try the mac & cheese. I spied a frozen version at Costco, and it was great to make the connection. Thankfully the line for food was not the same line that I needed to stand in to only purchase cheese."
,,,,,"They graciously offered me different samples of some of the cheeses that they have for sale in the case. I ended up purchasing almost everything. The cheese curds caught my eye, and purchase those along with some of the cheeses that Beechers has become known for locally. What is really cool, is to watch the cheese process since it's made in house. They even offer a kosher version!"
,,,,,"Their cheese is absolutely delightful. The flavor, texture, etc. makes it perfect for almost any cheese dish that you can think of. And what's really cool, is that on their website, they list recipes that they also sell in-house as food items, and they tell you the exact ingredients that you need for each dish. I'm super excited to make the mac & cheese."
,,,,,"Parking is not necessarily easy, but there is a huge parking lot way over yonder, so you'll get your exercise in for the day.  It's worth a push. They will ship, but I found that the shipping prices are pretty costly, and with proper refrigeration, you can pretty much purchase your choice of cheeses, and take them home on your own."
,,,,,This is a must if you love cheese... Your charcuterie board will thank you!
,,,,,"Mac and cheese can be a tricky dish because some recipes turn out to be bland or flavorless. At Beecher's, I was pleasantly surprised with their dishes. Their ""World's Best"" wasn't all that perfect to me but it was still good and had a nice flavor. Personally I liked their smoked salmon mac and cheese better- the dill is very strong but if you eat it all together with a but of the salmon, it was very tasty. I think if there was an additional aspect like toasted breadcrumbs, it would be next level. The price is pretty hefty but I'm assuming they're using their best fresh cheeses. "
,,,,,"Service was more just on the general, prompt side of things. Go very early or at opening time if you want a seat at the window where they make the cheese."
,,,,,"Overall, I would probably only come back for the smoked salmon Mac and Cheese or to try their other dishes."

,,,,,"This place is so cute and colorful! My mother and I stopped by for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was a little crowded but the line moved fast. Make sure to grab a seat, people will swoop in and try to steal them! There is unlimited tea refills for their hot teas and it is self serve with their flavors. The crumpets were delightful! The toppings were just the right amount and the crumpet itself was soft and buttery and then crunchy on the bottom!"
,,,,,The egg and smoked salmon crumpet was SO GOOD savory and the smoked salmon flavor was just enough to balance out the egg
,,,,,The lemon curd and ricotta was very sweet and sour at the same time! The cheese is super soft and is a little overpowered by the lemon curd is my only complaint
,,,,,"It is my first time here and also my first time trying crumpet. I heard of it before but never had the chance to try it. Anyway, it really do taste like a crispy muffin in my opinion. The store were very friendly and open to the public because they had a window for people to observe how the crumpet are made. "
,,,,,"The only downside of this restaurant I would say is that it is very hard to find a table to sit while enjoy the breakfast. Because they have many people going in and out. There are some table outside the restaurant but I don't like to eat outside in this cold weather. Despite that, this restaurant is still a great place to start the morning."
,,,,,Ok. 4 to 4.5 stars for amazing crumpets.
,,,,,+1 star for such great customer service.
,,,,,"Crumpets are basically fat pancakes with holes filled with melted butter. And seriously, I have not encountered a crumpet like these anywhere else."
,,,,,"When I used to spend a lot of time in Seattle, this was our go-to grab and go breakfast. After eating *many* crumpets, our favorites are the English Cheese, Pesto, and Tomato and The Vermont, which comes with maple, cream cheese, and walnuts. These are so yummy!"
,,,,,What gives The Crumpet Shop the extra star is how unbelievably nice the workers are. I dropped a crumpet today as I was trying to balance 3 plates and they made me a new one without charging me or anything. They also have a fantastic selection of teas and you can get free refills. So definitely worth it if you are a voracious tea drinker like I am :)
,,,,,We've missed you crumpets... and are so glad we are back again!!!
,,,,,This is my favorite breakfast stop in Seattle.  They're family owned and right around the corner from Pike's Place Market.
,,,,,The Crumpet Shop makes fresh crumpets serve them warmed/toasted with various savory or sweet toppings.  They also make a delectable in-house chai tea with ginger... it's the best I've ever had.
,,,,,Try the Maple Butter & Ricotta Cheese w/ Walnuts Crumpet for something sweet and the 
,,,,,Ham/Egg/Jalapeno/English Cheese Crumpet (add a slice of tomato for me) for something Savory.
,,,,,"The only downside to this place is the size of their space.  It's a great location because they're on First Avenue, true. However, there is not much seating or room to move around at all.  The line will appear horrendous but I will say, they are FAST and efficient, and it's worth any wait you might endure."
,,,,,"If you're lucky enough to get a window seat at the front of the shop facing busy First Avenue, you'll get to look at the bright lights of Deja Vu Showgirls nightclub across the street!"
,,,,,I really love The Crumpet Shop.
,,,,,"Nestled among the vast array of cafes of 1st Avenue, the crumpet shops offers a delectable breakfast experience and a much needed break from the 45 minute wait times. "
,,,,,"I came here around 11 on a Sunday and it was full enough to know it was popular, but empty enough to that I'd be seated and fed within minutes. I placed any order after waiting in a very short line, and was helped by an eager and bubbly staff. The food came out shortly thereafter."
,,,,,Extremely satisfying! 
,,,,,Greatest Hit: 
,,,,,"Robs Favorite - Quickly became my favorite as well, eggs cooked with pesto topped with a ripe red tomato on a base of a perfectly crispy English muffin with English cheese and a smoked salmon cream cheese. Left me full but not stuffed and light enough to avoid that post breakfast slump that you get from the usual bacon and eggs."
,,,,,Honorable Mention:
,,,,,Irish Breakfast Tea - Plays the perfect supporting role to the all important crumpet. Mixed with cream provided me with a late morning pick me up with unrivaled authenticity.
,,,,,Go early in the morning to get freshly made crumpets. You'd think that there's not gonna be anything special about the English version of biscuits but they're great!
,,,,,The savory to the sweet - the round holely bread is a great base.
,,,,,Watching the guy making fresh crumpets was fun.
,,,,,People are friendly~ food comes out fast!
,,,,,Local organic ingredients.
,,,,,Breakfast well done!!
,,,,,"**Don't try to cut through the crumpets, it doesn't cut very well - don't be shy,  just hold it & bite into it!!"
,,,,,"I got the almond butter crumpet with butter the first time and the crumpet with egg, cheese, and tomato the second time. Sooo delicious! Really well toasted and so fluffy. I loved it so much I came back twice in my 3 day trip to Seattle! They also have really great coffee! A must try in Seattle."
,,,,,"$3-4 for each crumpet! Crumpet = thick, fluffy, and slightly crispy pancake with toppings!"
,,,,,English Cheese Pesto w Tomato! Yummy the bottom of the crumpet was crispy!
,,,,,Maple Butter w Walnuts! 
,,,,,Random note: it's across the street from the strip club... SHOWGIRLS. 
,,,,,Seating is tight! I recommend a divide n conquer strategy: Someone order and the other find a table!
,,,,,I love this place. 
,,,,,My bro took me here several years ago after I landed and we go back every time I visit. They have savoury crumpets they have sweet crumpets they have plain crumpets-they're all good!
,,,,,I love the pesto crumpet and the nutella crumpet at the same damn time because I'm on vacation! I tell everyone to go here when they come to Seattle because it's so good. 
,,,,,Crumpets are made from a batter not a dough and are made on a griddle. You can see them making them sometimes through the window. They're #Magicians.
,,,,,It's right downtown and will soon become your fav spot.
,,,,,"Wow, what can be better than a bowl of hot groats with steamed milk and a toasted crumpet in a cold or chilling morning? This place is amazing for this fast and professional service and awesome people here! No matter what weather and what time, this place is so good to hang out."
,,,,,"FYI, there a so many options for your crumpet, but don't panic. hahaha"

,,,,,"I spent sometime in England and really enjoyed indulging in a crumpet with clotted cream and jam, once in a while. I was sad to see that the crumpet shop does not have clotted cream, which is a staple in England! I got egg and cheese on crumpet and it was ok, not bad but not sure if I'd go back for more."
,,,,,I've heard about this place for years but just visited for the first time last week. Delicious! I ordered the salmon crumpet and added tomato. It was perfect for lunch and so good. We arrived shortly after 1pm and hardly had to wait in line and easily found somewhere to sit.
,,,,,"Next time I'm in Seattle I want to try one of the sweet crumpets, but for now I heartily recommend The Crumpet Shop for an easy lunch in the city!"
,,,,,"Over the years, I've heard the jokes in the affected English accent about crumpets and tea, but until this visit, not only had I never tried one, I had no idea what they even looked like. Basically, they're a thicker, prettier, crustless version of english muffins and with the various toppings offered at the crumpet shop, they taste even better. They offer sweet and savory crumpets, but on this visit, we just went with the sweet options such as the lemon curd and the whipped ricotta with walnuts and honey....oh my!! They also make a fresh scone loaf daily and it is so moist and a must try"
,,,,,Delicious!!! We tried both sweet and savory and were not disappointed.  Can't wait to go back
,,,,,"I ordered the robs favorite with green eggs, tomato, and salmon cream cheese. My friend ordered the egg, ham, and cheese which looked a bit better than mine. It wasnt exactly filling, but it was still a great price for the portion and quality of food you get. Im still not exactly sure what a crumpet is. Maybe I should have asked while I was there. From what I could tell it was some sort of really tasty bagel buscuit type thing, but dont get it confused it is nothing like buscuit bitch. In my optionion its better. I cant wait to go back and try the green eggs and ham."
,,,,,"Almost 1600 reviews, 4.5 stars???? Reallly?!!!! Why?!!"
,,,,,"Well, it doesn't really matter because reviews are very subjective. During my visit, I did not find this place worthy of the second visit at all....... "
,,,,,I got the macchiato along with the hazelnut and ricotta Crumpet. The macchiato was disgusting. The crumpet was ok........ 
,,,,,"As I was waiting in line to order, I could see that for the menu items that included eggs and ham, they were using microwaves to cook them in..... Ummmm, not good at all..... "
,,,,,"Service was super, super slow. There were not enough employees to do the tasks..... One employee was literally doing 5 things at once.... I actually felt bad for them, but started wondering of why the owners are not hiring more people when they know that they are a ""popular"" breakfast spot according to Yelp....."
,,,,,"Anyways, I have had my share of crumpets ...."
,,,,,Thank you but no thank you!
,,,,,"Our first time trying crumpets which were delicious.  They're hard to describe, but they're crispy on the bottom like griddle cooked English muffins and sink-your-teeth-in tender like pancakes on top.  If you've never had crumpets I highly recommend giving them a try.  They're a bit expensive at $4-5 per crumpet (each about the size of half an English muffin) and the wait was long, but definitely worth it to try these expertly made treats.  "
,,,,,We also ordered a scone with lemon curd.  They're like the most tender and fluffiest cornbread you've ever had without grittiness unlike any  scone I've ever had.  The edges were amazingly crispy.  Yum.
,,,,,"Having a few short hours to be tourists in downtown Seattle, it's good old Yelp to the rescue! The crumpet shop comes up with good reviews. And to be honest. I really didn't specifically know what a crumpet was. You know, because I'm an ignorant American. I apologize to the world on our behalf. "
,,,,,"Anyway, it turns out, its basically an English muffin, but just a little doughier and thicker. Everyone loves a good starchy vessel to carry their flavor of choice on a overcast day right? I choose ham, egg, and english cheddar as my savory preference shines through, but rest assured, those of you with sweet tooths won't be left out in the rain. Biting into it I felt comforted by the bready aroma. Just a small quaint little place to visit for a quick breakfast. Warm and intimate, make a quick stop!"
,,,,,"Say hello to the Pike Market lines, but also deliciousness. "
,,,,,"I avoided it several times because of the line, but finally caught it at 1:00pm relatively manageable. "
,,,,,"The crumpets were amazing and week worth the hype. I had a hard time picking between savory and sweet but went with sweet because I just had lunch, but regrets for not doing both because their savory (smoked salmon as an option) looked amazing when someone else ordered it. "
,,,,,"Vermont was perfect and I also got the risotto and jam. Both amazing. Nothing really fancy in the presentation, but overall simple and s""crump""tious. "
,,,,,Keep in mind there are limited tables and no WiFi. But great location in this crazily crowded area and really good service.
,,,,,Cozy little cafe with divine crumpet sandwiches and great service.  Waiting for them to reopen.  Good coffee and tea as well.  Owners are super friendly.

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Wow - what a crowd! When I went in the morning (around 10 am), the line was short but it was still out the door. I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered, but the crumpet was good. I personally didn't think it was one of the best things I've ever had and I won't be waiting in line for it again but maybe I'm just not a crumpet gal. Other people seemed to really like it and this place is definitely a Seattle gem."
,,,,,"delicious crumpets! When my friend said she wanted to get crumpets I was like what are you talking about? They're probably not going to be that good. Boy, was I wrong. They were delicious! I wish we ordered more. Even just the simple one was delicious. There were a ton of people there ordering too. You can even buy the crumpets themselves and take them home."
,,,,,Very pricey for what you actually get. I ordered a maple butter crumpet and asked for a vegan crumpet since I saw mention of vegan options in reviews.  I asked the lady I was ordering from and she told me the options for vegan crumpets and said they can do it without cow butter. 
,,,,,I got my order and took a bite. It was filled with greasy butter. I have been vegan for over 5 years and am severely lactose intolerant. I still remember what butter tastes like
,,,,,I understand cross contamination in restaurants. But the one bite of the crumpet was drenched in butter. I went back to ask if there was butter in my crumpet. They told me there was. The lady preparing the crumpet wasnt told to not put butter.
,,,,,They gave me a new one. The crumpet itself is fine. I had to take off most of the maple butter. Too much and too sweet. 
,,,,,"Overall, I would not come again due to the price point and crumpet itself. Not too special"
,,,,,Very happy a buddy showed me this gem of a shop. 
,,,,,I had never had a crumpet so my buddy got us 3 of his favorites and they were all amazing in their own ways. I will be a crumpeting on a much more regular basis from here on.
,,,,,"We started with the Robby's Fav and wouldn't you know it was my favorite as well. A perfectly made crumpet topped with salmon cream cheese, green eggs (need to eat another to feel out what made it green but I can assure you it's tasty) and a nice tomato slice to top off. Fantastic little morsel."
,,,,,"Then we had the Walrus (an off menu item) which is topped with cream cheese, honey and walnuts. It's very sweet and the crunch texture from the nuts goes really well with it."
,,,,,"Final was the Ricotta Ras which was also pretty phenomenal. I was more into the savory but this was really sweet and tasty. Ricotta is always a winner and the raspberry jam is made at the place so it is extra tasty, the berries were not quite puréed but definitely mashed well. "
,,,,,Really dig this spot and have a feeling I will be a regular before too long.
,,,,,"I went with a friend and it was amazing. I often think about this place because the one time I went was not enough. It's so close to my work, and can easily bus it here for a early breakfast and walk around the market before it opens (love that quiet, everyone is getting ready to open before all the tourists come). I can't remember which ones I got, all I know is that my friend and I shared one savory and one sweet one before we went off to yoga. "
,,,,,"Needless to say I don't care what they put on these fluffy crumpets, I will more than likely eat it. "
,,,,,I would like to get a box of plain ones so I can do them up at home with nutella and fruit or a fluffy Egg Florentine with cheese or something like that. 
,,,,,"Damn, now I'm hungry again and just had lunch. Well, looks like I have to schedule a trip next week, on pay day! Till then i'll be dreaming about them crumpets."
,,,,,"The scene: Small cafe with a small selection of seating. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable, happy to share more information about their menu. There's a good selection of teas and coffee, in addition to food."
,,,,,"Good for: crumpets, per their namesake. I've tried them all and can say they're all great. If you've never had a crumpet, think of the english muffin but lighter. I've never had good crumpets so consistently outside of this place."
,,,,,"Must have: Rob's Favorite or Lemon Curd, depending on your craving for savory vs. sweet. Lemon curd has been a long time favorite, the creamy lemon curd pairs so well with the fresh ricotta on top of the hot crumpet. My last visit a friend ordered Rob's favorite and now I'm torn on which is better. It has a fried egg cooked in pesto sauce, so the pesto is very rich without being too saucy or dry. The smoked salmon cream cheese has hearty slices of salmon, and the tomato topping the dish was hearty and juicy. The ingredients together were perfect and I still think of the flavors a week later."
,,,,,Can't believe I had forgotten to write my review about this awesome small place it was at the top of the list when we visited from California and it did not disappoint...... Ordered all the popular ones and could not wait to devour them the coffee was also pretty dang good service was nice and efficient can't wait to return
,,,,,"This cute little shop is in the building on the corner of Pike and 1st. (Took me a while to find it, but saw a sign for it on Pike). I got two crumpets (a cream cheese, egg, ham and the goat cheese, walnut, and honey), plus an 8oz chai. "
,,,,,The bad: I'm not a fan of ginger so the chai was meh for me. 
,,,,,"The good: everything else! Crumpets are kind of like a really thick, sourdough ish pancake round and the little bubbly nooks on the surface are a perfect receptacle for sauce and spreads. The cream cheese, egg, and ham needed a little sriracha (thankfully they had some on hand) but everything was really, excellent and delicious! "
,,,,,I ended up taking a little package of four plain crumpets home. Would love to come back here again!
,,,,,"Like the lady who was ahead of me...""that's it?"" "
,,,,,"I was skeptical about coming here because after reading online about what a crumpet was/is, I didn't want to spend $8 on a piece of pancake. However, the date insisted since we may never encounter a crumpet again..."
,,,,,"Came here on a Wednesday mid-morning, and luckily there was no line. Lots of crumpets still in the making, though! There are about 15-20 seats here."
,,,,,I ordered:
,,,,,"1 crumpet with organic honey, walnuts and cream cheese // "
,,,,,+Crispy yet spongey texture! I like that it's not overcooked/baked. 
,,,,,+Delicious amount of spread for each bite. It's dainty but also satisfying at the same time. 
,,,,,Pros:
,,,,,+Extensive menu. I like that you can do savory or sweet! 
,,,,,Cons:
,,,,,"-Kinda pricey. I know, I know. Some may argue that for the quality, it's worth. For me? I think it's kind of a once in a life time thing. "
,,,,,Tips/Observations:
,,,,,-Unlimited tea if you order loose leaf here! 
,,,,,-They close once they run out...so come earlier if possible! 
,,,,,-You clean up yourself. Put the utensils and plates in the bin!
,,,,,-25 cents for the to-go box. But...what happens when they run out of chairs and people are forced to leave? 
,,,,,"Overall, I'm impressed but not in love. Give it a try, if you haven't had a crumpet!"
,,,,,"I did not know what crumpets were and I have been missing out. Honestly, I have never seen a place that sells crumpets so this must be one of the few. Crumpets are like a mix between a biscuit and an English muffin. I guess its meant to be eaten open faced with toppings as thats how they serve it here."
,,,,,"I recommend coming early because it does get crowded. We came in and there was a line out the door. Luckily, the line moves fast but the food takes a bit to come out. If you want to dine in there is limited seating."
,,,,,"We got 2 types: Maple Butter, Walnut and Cream and the Green Eggs with English Cheese. The Maple Butter one was AMAZING. I loved the play on texture with the cream and the walnut. Super crunchy and rich and not overly sweet. This is perfect with a cup of coffee in the morning. The green eggs are like pesto eggs. Pretty tasty but not as mind blowing as the maple butter."

,,,,,"The new owners now are a young bunch We travelled hundreds of miles for this Saw the sign that they suddenly closed for the day When I tried to enquire, they just said ""read the sign, we're closed"" with no explanation The first owners were very friendly and helpful This bunch of new owners are extremely rude and condescending! We'll never go back !"
,,,,,"Pretty expensive place and you gotta tip here. At least the employees are happy and respectful, so I'd come back."
,,,,,The sweet crumpets are better than the savory.
,,,,,This little place was so delicious. If you're going with your boyfriend of girlfriend I recommend to buy two savory crumpets(one each) and one sweet one(to share) so that you're able to taste how good these really are. My boyfriend and I got the Green Eggs and cheese and smoked salmon crumpet along with a Nutella crumpet. both were great and the people working there were really nice:)
,,,,,So yeah... this place is amazing. 
,,,,,I have been on the hunt for a crumpet because I have a lot of European friends who eat them. Finally found this place and I already decided I'm going to be a regular here. 
,,,,,They have A TON of crumpet options! Savory and sweet. I was so overwhelmed that I started with the basic: butter. A little $$$ for a single crumpet (in my opinion) but wowowowowow I don't even care about the price anymore. I need these in my life. It's like an english muffin but better. Crispy on the outside. Warm and fluffy on the inside. They're super fresh and fast. before I was even done paying they had it on the counter ready for me to eat. 
,,,,,Highly recommend!!!
,,,,,Vermont maple butter crumpet is my favorite! YUM! Amazing. There are so many other great ones. With a cup of tea  It makes a great morning or afternoon snack. Right there by the Market.
,,,,,"These light, fluffy, slightly crispy little morsels are crazy delicious!  We stopped in for breakfast and I was famished so I ordered one with Pesto, English cheese, and tomato.  I also had them add ham.  I was so damn good!  And surprisingly filling for something so simple.  My boyfriend ordered one with salmon cream cheese and an egg and he said it was one of the best things he ate while in Seattle.  That' sayin' something because there was no shortage of eating while we were there.  "
,,,,,"The place is small and cramped.  When it's busy, plan to get up close and personal with those in line.  We sat outside at one of their small tables and walked the hustle and bustle near Pike Place Market.  "
,,,,,Note:  Grab a cup of coffee to go with your crumpet.  Their plain coffee is really good.
,,,,,"Delicious, scrumptious, filling, and amazing price, considering the quality of ingredients and labor put into making them. If you sit a the table facing the street, you get the added chuckle of eating crumpets directly across the street from the nudie bar, Showgirls (crumpets and strumpets- it's a party, y'all!!lol)"
,,,,,"I've eaten a lot of crumpets in my life(used to be married to a Brit), but never homemade. We got the Nutella and chocolate on ricotta, and I got the maple, walnut and ricotta. I also got the salmon tomato crumpet. I wanted to try a sweet and savory. I preferred the maple walnut one the best, although the rest were yummy. I also bought half a dozen crumpets to go- they sell them in 4 and six packs. I'm sticking them in my freezer tomorrow."
,,,,,"Nice staff, tight(ish) quarters, friendly upbeat, and youthful(but not in the annoying way). It is accessible, but I didn't realise that when I opened the door facing the street- that entrance is not, and has two stairs. There ate only two small tables in the accessible part of the cafe, and you order via standing in line and ordering. "
,,,,,Definitely check this spot out!
,,,,,"Under hyped, this place is amazing. I thought a crumpet was just an English muffin but I was happily wrong. The crumpet is so fluffy and perfectly baked. Anyone who is not from town, this is a must."
,,,,,"Everybody needs to eat a crumpet. I get the Robs Special, but recently tried butter and jam. It was extremely memorable. The staff is Allstar talent and always make me feel so welcome and appreciated!."
,,,,,The Maple butter crumpet was terrific. I wasn't sure what to expect. Many of the places by Pike's Place are mediocre but this was a pleasant surprise!Maple Butter Crumpet

,,,,,"I really enjoy the Pike Market area, and I hadn't been here since about 2012. I remembered this little crumpet shop, so in I went. It was busy on a weekday morning. I had the ""life changer"" (I think it was called something similar to this?) with the Ricotta cheese and maple syrup. It really was very satisfying. I got it to go, but I was too excited, so I decided to stay and just eat it right then and there. Had a really little cup of coffee, which was brewed fresh for me. A little pricey, but a nice treat."
,,,,,"Honestly, I did not know what a crumpet was exactly, until the workers explained to us what it was! My boyfriend wanted to try crumpets here since he saw all the raving reviews on Yelp. We were one of the few people there at 7 am, so yay for no lines! :)"
,,,,,"One of the workers recommended the green eggs on top of smoked salmon cream cheese (not entirely sure of the exact name of the crumpet). Definitely unique style of eggs - I can now say I finally tried those green eggs that Dr. Seuss was talking about LOL! I believe the eggs are made with some kind of pesto sauce, so they're this green-ish color and then they're topped off with a big slice of tomato. I only tried a couple of bites, but each bite was packed with so much favor! All the different ingredients definitely compliment each other very well. "
,,,,,"Very glad that I tried The Crumpet Shop, definitely one of the more unique places to eat at Pike's! Next time, I'll be sure to grab my own and maybe try one of the sweet crumpets!"
,,,,,"Very quaint place to start for breakfast or a snack! The restaurant its self is quite small and casual, think of like a coffee shop. The crumpets themselves were amazing! Crispy/crunchy on the bottom and soft in the inside. We got one with cream cheese and walnuts and one with lemon curd and ricotta. Personally thought the cream cheese walnut combo was better. For the proportion size it was pretty pricey."
,,,,,I've walked past this little shop numerous times on my way to Pike Place Market but oddly have never ventured in until recently.  
,,,,,"Entrance is along 1st Street or a back way entrance from Pike Street up a flight of stairs; just follow the signs.  Gets pretty busy in the morning but the line moves quickly enough and is definitely worth the wait. Shop is quaint with about 5 tables and counter seating with stools along the walls so it may be hard to snag a seat during busy times. A few tables outside if the weather is fair. Don't care, I'll eat that crumpet standing upside down if I need to. "
,,,,,"But what's a crumpet? Like an English muffin but less rigid and moister with a selection of toppings to add, either sweet or savory. Having a sweet tooth and only going in for a snack I choose the ""Vermont"" crumpet with cream cheese, maple butter and walnuts. Just wow! Tastes amazing right off the grill with the warmth of the crisp crumpet nestling in with the maple butter. Highly recommend!"
,,,,, 
,,,,,"Since I already wolfed down a cup of joe for the morning I got the house made Chai made with fresh organic ginger. It was an interesting and delightful combination, especially if you're a fan of ginger, which I am. "
,,,,,"Even with the heavy flow of customers, the workers were friendly, upbeat and the line moved right along. "
,,,,,My only regret is not having found this place sooner! The Crumpet Shop is my new go-to if I'm anywhere near Pike Place Market. 
,,,,,"If you've never had a crumpet, why not give it a try?"
,,,,,This review is based solely on the coffee because I am not really interested in crumpets.
,,,,,I had a delightful run viewing the Puget Sound and came across this place on my cool down walk back to the hotel.
,,,,,The Crumpet shop is close to the Pike Place Market so the cafe was full of tourists.
,,,,,I almost walked out thinking it was a tourist trap.
,,,,,"Luckily, I was wrong."
,,,,,Customer service is friendly (it seems they are used to puzzled tourists coming into their cafe).
,,,,,"The way they communicate drink orders seems old fashioned but the system works because I got my coffee efficiently. When I drank my latte, I was surprised at the well roasted flavor of it!"
,,,,,"I was planning on visiting more cafes later that day so I opted for a decaf latte, yet the latte had a nice robust flavor."
,,,,,"If you aren't curious about crumpets, at least try their coffee!"
,,,,,"I actually think the crumpet shop is my favorite place at pike place market. I have used the crumpet shop as any visitors first stop at the market and it makes the trip start out on a high note. There is often a line in summer, so try to go during the week or colder months. I love splitting a couple crumpets, usually one savory and one sweet. Love the pesto, ricotta and lemon, plain honey. I actually don't think I have found one that I don't like! Please go here and support an amazing independent business in the historic pike place market."
,,,,,I fancy myself a lovely moist fluffy crumpet but a well executed crumpet is hard to find. While visiting Seattle I knew I had to check out The Crumpet Shop. They were actually my first foodie spot on my adventures. I heard that there is usually a line here but I was lucky to arrive when they were a bit less busy. The workers were very welcoming and friendly to explain to me my many different options. 
,,,,,"Marco and his coworkers convinced me to get the Life Changer ($5.85). It it a toasted crumpet topped with cream cheese, maple butter and walnuts. The crumpet was moist and fluffy. It absorbed the topping perfectly into its' crust. The cream cheese really helped balanced the sweetness of the maple butter and the walnuts added a nice crunch to each bite. They were even nice enough to cut it down the middle for me so I wouldn't make too much of a mess. "
,,,,,"I also ordered a 16oz Crumpet Shop Blend Tea ($3.35). Marco gave me a cup and directed me to their tea dispensers. The teas have free refills and they welcome you to try as many teas as you would like. Next to the teas were sugar, honey, milk, almond milk and other accommodations to add onto your tea. The warm tea was perfect for the chilly day I was enduring and it was a perfect compliment to my crumpet. "
,,,,,I really wish that I had a crumpet and tea specialty shop that satisfies me as much as the Crumpet Shop in Seattle. It was really the best first stop to jump start my adventures. I can definitely see myself fly back to Seattle for these crumpets ;)
,,,,,"I don't know if this is public knowledge, but a crumpet is similar to an English muffin, but with much more flavor."
,,,,,The crumpet shop is a blessing in Pike's Market Place. I went in and ordered a crumpet with butter and honey and ate it in the restaurant. 
,,,,,What a peaceful break to enjoy this crumpet in the midst of the craziness of Pike's Place. Everyone working here was so kind and helpful. I would love to come back / can you please consider opening up a spot in Boston???? Pretty please with crumpets on top?
,,,,,"I have been to Seattle ample of times but never checked out this place. A friend of mine recommended this place and during this visit, I stopped here for lunch and it was really good! Crumpet Shop is definitely going in my must visit places in Seattle."
,,,,,"I went there on a Monday afternoon and service was pretty quick. I tried both savory and sweet option. For savory, I had the ""Egg, English Cheese & Jalapeño Peppers on Cream Cheese & Ham"". They have a great selection of tea options and you get free refills. I got the ricotta and Nutella crumpet for take out as a sweet option. The only problem I found was that there was less Nutella and more of ricotta cheese for the sweet crumpet."
,,,,,Overall: a must visit place when you visit Seattle.
,,,,,Tip: Crumpet shop closes early and I would recommend to visit it during the weekdays when there is less rush.
,,,,,"Our Seattle foodie high point comes as we stumble across The Crumpet Shop. We arrive as they're closing, and running out of crumpets, so we're offered ""employee crumpets"", the less beautiful crumpets that they don't sell to customers. We're ecstatic, we came for the taste, not the look of the crumpets. Our choice of toppings: the maple butter."
,,,,,"It's amazing! The crumpet is both soft and crunchy, the maple butter is sweet and flavorful. Win!"
,,,,,"The shop's staff are superb: friendly and enthusiastic about their products, their quality, their provenance. As the customers slowly filter out we chat about all the things, have a chance to try their tasty chai, and make plans to return someday for their savory crumpets."

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,The crumpet shop was one of my favorite pit stops in Seattle. I got the robs favorite which was absolutely delicious!!  It comes with their smoked salmon cream cheese smear and a green egg with English cheese and tomato. The green egg is a pesto infused fried egg. It sounds simple but eaten together it was delicious!!  I think the salmon smear was my favorite part. It was savory and fresh.  I guess Seattle is known for its smoked fish and it's probably the best I've had. 
,,,,,The space is a little small so getting seats might be hard but it's really worth it to come here!   They make their crumpets in house and they have a bay window where you can watch the process. It's quite interesting. Prices are cheap and service is good. Next tome I go I'll be sure to try their sweet ones as well.
,,,,,"A quick update to let you know the crumpet shop is consistently fabulous. A lot of local and organic ingredients, friendly and informed staff that keeps the line moving quickly, many delicious options from Sweet to savory. the best scones we've ever had. They are moist and nothing like what you get at a typical coffee shop."
,,,,,I suppose the only new thing we have to say is just that it still is Simply the Best.  Rarely does a place have such consistency over decades. It not only remains great it continues to improve and small little ways.
,,,,,Oh and did I mention their house add chai?! You can have it with almond milk for a dairy free version as well. 
,,,,,If you're lucky you might be able to buy a pack of four to take home to enjoy.
,,,,,We were there again this June and will go back again very soon!
,,,,,Simply The Best!  Been coming here for 28 years. It never  disappoints.  Now organic crumpets   Was in Savour magazine years ago and lives up to its hype.  Still family owned and run..thx Rob.  Friendly staff.  Go at odd hours if u want to avoid lines
,,,,,Best scones buttery .  Unlike the kinds u get at most coffee shops 
,,,,,"Now my favorite crumpet is with egg and English cheese, slice it tomato"
,,,,,And cucumber 
,,,,,I bring my British friends and none have ever said they know of a better place in UK. They may not admit it's the best but they will always say it's one of the best crumpets they've ever had.  None of them can recommend someplace better. 
,,,,,For organic Crumpets it is To the moon and back delish.  If there was a higher rating it would get it
,,,,,For friendly service even under pressure and its true local community vibe..it also gets my five plus plus plus rating.   Love you Crumpet shop.
,,,,,Anyone up for some crumpets and tea? 
,,,,,WHAT IS A CRUMPET?
,,,,,"ORGANIC, SERVED SWEET OR SAVORY"
,,,,,"A Crumpet is not a mere food item, but an experience--prepared in a timely sequence and best enjoyed as fresh as possible. When a batch comes hot off the griddle it is racked to cool and ready for your order. Then, each individual Crumpet is toasted, buttered and topped with quality ingredients, either sweet or savory, in combinations, simple or complex.  Everything from our kitchen is cooked with organic flour, with ingredients responsibly sourced from the best available vendors."
,,,,,"Located upstairs near the Pike place market, if your looking for some delicious authentic crumpets that are freshly made to order then look no further. There is not much seating here and there will be a long line that forms outside the door so come early! I find it best to take it to go and walk around while eating it since it doesn't get too messy. If you can handle an egg Mcmuffin than you can handle a crumpet! "
,,,,,Here is what we ordered: 
,,,,,Egg on Wild Smoked Salmon mixed with Cream Cheese 4.95(Rob's Favorite)
,,,,,Priced fairly well and the crumpet itself was nice and fluffy. Overall this is a recommended place to go to if visiting the market for a good breakfast snack.
,,,,,"I've been to Seattle countless times and my go to for desert was the Cow-chip, which has shut its doors permanently in Seattle. Well, I had a sweet tooth and decided to give this place a shot. I ordered the Vermont aka ""The life changer"" which was recommended by the cashier. Wow. Very light and creamy taste. It had the perfect balance of sweetness from the maple butter and saltiness from the cake."
,,,,,"Super cute place in the market. Unlimited tea!!!!! First time ever eating a crumpet but I thought it tasted great. Only bought one--the salmon cream cheese and egg which was good, but you probably need a couple for it to be a filling meal"
,,,,,Overall: 4.3/5.
,,,,,"Pretty solid crumpets. They aren't cheap at ~$4-6 each for a crumpet that's about 3-4 inches in diameter. I got the Vermont ""life changing"" crumpet. It was really good, but not life changing. Would come back and try some of the other flavors."
,,,,,"Every time I'm in Seattle I must stop here.  I love the crumpet ricotta, walnuts and honey.  On my most recent trip I tried two new ones."
,,,,,"The Vermont came with cream cheese, maple cream, and chopped walnuts. This is the best sweet crumpet on the menu.  The combination of maple cream on top of cream cheese is so perfect.  It's smooth and rich but not too sweet because the cream cheese balances it out.  Now I can't order anything else because this on me is sooo good."
,,,,,I also tried the lemon curd crumpet.  It's good.  The lemon curd is tart but creamy and sweet.
,,,,,This place is legendary.  Solid 5 stars.
,,,,,"I wasn't even sure what a crumpet was, but I wanted to see what the hype was about so we checked it out. There was a line, but it went quickly."
,,,,,"Of course I had to try the homemade chai which was delicious. You can certainly taste the spice, and it went perfectly with the ricotta walnut honey crumpet. I loved the flavors and textures and it was soft but toasty to perfection. This place is worth checking out when you're at the market!"
,,,,,"I often frequent Pike Place Market when I have friends in town, and luckily for me, the Crumpet Shop was on their list of places they wanted to try. I've always seen the long line for this place and hesitated, since I'm not too sure what could be so great about a crumpet, but I was sorely mistaken."
,,,,,"I ordered the Lemon Curd and Ricotta Crumpet, and it was so delicious! The lemon curd was really tart, and not overly sweet. The crumpet was also toasted with some salted butter, which really balanced out the mild sweetness of the curd. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little bit less ricotta and more curd, but other than that, I was really happy to have tried this place."
,,,,,I'll be back to try out one of their savory crumpets in the future!
,,,,,Tea and crumpets are a staple in the UK and Seattle. There may be an excess of coffee shops but this is where you come for multiple varieties of tea. Pair that with fresh crumpets and ingredients and you have a great snack or light meal before they close mid-afternoon. Crumpets are topped with both sweet and savory options.
,,,,,"With all the foot traffic around the Pike Street Market, you might expect the shop to try and push customers to leave, not the Crumpet Shop. Tea is all you can drink and seating is comfortable and quiet. The staff is open and friendly. Great place for a break."
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,First time trying a crumpet- really enjoyed it. Savory pesto one was phenomenal. Sweet one was little too sweet for me. Next time I will go with something without maple butter. Good coffee as well. New regular spot for breakfast.
,,,,,"What the heck is a crumpet? Yes, we've all heard of the super-posh tea and crumpet combo, but most Americans won't be able to say they've tried a real crumpet, me included. As far as I was concerned, a crumpet and an English muffin were one in the same. "
,,,,,= L O C A T I O N =
,,,,,"We were easily able to find it in Pike Place. The interior is pretty small, but nicely themed in an old-timey Alice In Wonderland way. Makes perfect sense to go with that for the murals due to the mad tea party and all. "
,,,,,= F O O D =
,,,,,"+ ROB'S FAVORITE ($6.25): Contains green egg, english cheese, and tomato on smoked salmon spread. So, a crumpet has a much different texture than English muffins -- they are soft and moist. This crumpet was pretty good, but I think that it was a  bit expensive for what it was. "
,,,,,= S E R V I C E =
,,,,,"It was okay...Nothing special to me. However, it was cool that they had a window looking into the area where they made their crumpets. "
,,,,,"If you are a tourist I'd prefer going elsewhere. If you still would like to eat a nice, light breakfast, might want to bring this into your rotation...but again, it was a little steep for me."
,,,,,= = = = 
,,,,,Food: 4 // Service: 3 // Environment: 5 // Price: 2
,,,,,"True legit Gangster Crumpets. They ARE really really crumpets. Made to be eaten ASAP. My only concern ding from a 5 star is that they were a tiny bit undercooked, and if you were someone new to crumpets you might be disappointed. I bought mine to go, and got a complete lecture on how to eat them to go with my bag and napkins. I guess the lesson is for the uncrumpet-initiated, but don't assume that everybody who steps into your shop needs a lecture."
,,,,,Wonderful place. Quick service. Delicious and definitely left me craving more. Wish I could have tried them all. Went back the next day and sad they were closed. Went back home to California searching for a crumpet shop near by.
,,,,,"Awesome spot!! The crumpet is a new experience with delicious variety. I think you can seriously have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and not get bored. "
,,,,,Choosing the right one for your current mood is most difficult. But regardless of which one you eat they are delicious.
,,,,,"The only downfall is the tight quarters and the wait to get a table, but it also creates a flair, that makes you feel like you are eating in grandma's kitchen and that is most definitely something to go for."
,,,,,We will definitely come back next time we are in town.
,,,,,"RICOTTA CRUMPETS HERE ARE DELISH!! My friend showed me this spot, and it was my first time having a crumpet. It's similar to an English muffin."
,,,,,Great taste! Very sweet and kind staff. Coffee not the best but the pastry is worth it!!
,,,,,"I ordered ""the walrus"" - the walnut, ricotta cheese, and honey crumpet that was recommended online. It was a really nice novelty - definitely something you can't find at other cafes. I really enjoyed the flavors, and the texture was almost waffle-like in it's fluffy-yet-crunchy ness. We enjoyed it, but for $5+, probably wouldn't get a second one for a long time. Once you've tried it, you've tried it."
,,,,,I love this place so much. The only way this place could be more perfect is if it were open all hours of the day and I could eat their crumpets for every single meal. The crumpets (and scones!! Super moist and nice) are delicious and they have lots of different tea with free refills. 
,,,,,"Every time I come, I get tomato pesto and Parmesan and a sweet crumpet, which tends to be either ricotta and lemon curd or ricotta and honey and walnuts. Both are incredible and I have no idea which I prefer. I did get tomato pesto with imported English cheese once because it's more expensive and I was curious but honestly I prefer the Parmesan."
,,,,,"I love this place, there is always  a first time for everything well almost.  This place was surprisingly good.  The scone was nice and fluffy and very r"
,,,,,Tasty with the lemon curd.  We also each had a crumpet with egg ham and cheese and it was excellent.   The inside of this cafe feels like you are in England coffee shop in like a little town feel.  The staff were awesome we had a tone of questions and they were very resourceful.  Thank you for a new experience
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"We tried the crumpets with green egg because it was suggested by yelpers. It is interesting to look at, but taste-wise is just whatever. It just taste like eggs. Price is definitely affordable. "
,,,,,"The category is a brunch place, but I ate it as an afternoon snack. The place is small and nice. It is a family owned business and the workers there are young. Probably their kids. They're so nice though. They don't have a lot of seats, mostly counters, and it's not that many. At the time we went there, we did not have too much trouble with seatings though."
,,,,,Would definitely go back again if in the area.
,,,,,I had no idea what a crumpet was until I stumbled upon this place. It was a cool experience and I wish I was able to sample the other crumpets! I just got the Raspberry Jam crumpet and it was delicious! It was buttery and crunchy yet doughy in the inside!
,,,,,"Nice, helpful service. We had the crumpet with ham/egg, the jalapeño one and the pesto egg (green egg). The pesto one was by far the best and would get again. The others were solid for a reasonably priced breakfast that gives you some protein. I would like to go back to try a sweet one next time."
,,,,,"For those of you wondering what a crumpet is (I understand most of you already do...), crumpets are... English Muffins!"
,,,,,"There were not a lot of shops open to eat so early in the morning here at Pike Place, but this is one of them... and there was a line already too!"
,,,,,There are numerous options for your crumpets and we went with the following:
,,,,,WILD SALMON placed salmon spread and cucumbers on top of the crumpets.
,,,,,EGG AND CHEESE on the crumpets are also available.
,,,,,Their SCONE WITH LEMON CURD is VERY GOOD. That scone was fresh fresh freshly baked and the lemon curd was not too tart.
,,,,,The TEA is pre-brewed and available for self-serve from several thermoses. 
,,,,,The MOCHA and the HOT CHOCOLATE are good.
,,,,,"There are a couple of tables with chairs in the small space as well as a counter with stools underneath. We were unfortunate enough to have been surrounded by non-morning people (I am being diplomatic considering their awful attitudes) frustrated with the customer-chair ratio at the time of our visit, but this has nothing to do with the shop."
,,,,,"The covid precautions were great! They have their register behind plexiglass, and then after you order there's a spot around the corner to pick up."
,,,,,"Everyone was super friendly, including when I called with a question beforehand. There was parking on the cobblestone part of Pike Place Market on a weekday morning at 8am ish, and easily walked there."
,,,,,Really delicious crumpets. 
,,,,,I got marmite to try it and a butter one! The honey ones and savory ones also looked super good.
,,,,,This place is cute and the crumpets are good! It was a nice light breakfast. We sat outside on a beautiful day.
,,,,,No thank you !!!! Extremely d pensive for very average treats plus the pace gets packed and chances are you will end up sitting in a tiny corner with your plate on your lap. 
,,,,,Portions are very small and basic 
,,,,,Coffee was good and the staff was friendly enough but that's about it. 
,,,,,Grab a coffee to go and you'll be better off
,,,,,"i love crumpets. they have fresh-baked crumpets with toppings of all kinds, sweet and savory. if you find that the lines for the other places at pike place are too long, you won't be disappointed by this place. "
,,,,,i opted for the wild salmon and cucumber crumpet. props for having wild salmon! i inhaled it. the crumpet was still warm. 
,,,,,you order at the counter and pick up at the counter.
,,,,,This place was delicious. The crumpets were extremely satisfying! Definitely on my go-to list next time I travel to Seattle.
,,,,,"Simple but delicious. I asked English girl (yes from England) ""what's the difference between English muffin and Crumpets. Other than Crumpets sound adorable. Crumpets have holes in the top and have crunchy exterior where as English muffin is soft bread. But a toaster blurs those lines. "
,,,,,Crumpet with lemon curd and ricotta cheese. 7 of 10. Best Crumpet I've had but grain of salt only Crumpets I've had. Based on other rave reviews safe bet. Great English muffin ; )
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"A whole shop for crumpets, how cute and fun! I guess I didn't know what a crumpet was entirely before this, but it's essentially like an English muffin. The crumpet itself was pretty good. It was a great texture and all the holes in it that makes a good ""English muffin"", it was hot and fresh. They have a variety of options like savory (ham, cheese, and egg) or sweet (preserves or lemon curd with ricotta). We tried all 3 and enjoyed them. My only complaint is that it's good but not great and not amazing. I would go back because it's a nice bite to eat and not heavy but it's not something I would rave about to other people."
,,,,,"Came here this morning (7/7/18) to grab some food before we got on the ferry! They were so friendly. The food was hot, fast, &delicious! The eggs were fluffy, the ham had the right amount of salt, and the crumpet was soft and crunchy on the outside! YUM!!! It's very  very simple dish yet executed very well. The line moved very quickly which was great since we were trying to catch the Vashon ferry. "
,,,,,"They are family owned and you can tell! The crumpets are made fresh daily It's a perfect place to stop because it's right on 1st! Just a hop, skip, &a jump to pike place market!   "
,,,,,"I can't say how the tea was since I skipped out on this, but I really should come back and try a cup!"
,,,,,What I will say though is that the lemon curd crumpet is magical! If you love lemon meringue pie then this is a must! A wonderful morning treat!
,,,,,"This cozy, lovely shop is family owned and operated, very warm and welcoming. The inside is narrow and long, not much space that can fill up quickly. When we got there, they had a line that went out the back door, which was expected from what I heard about this place."
,,,,,"The line moved steadily, although not very fast. Most of the seats were taken, inside and out, but the turnover was pretty good. "
,,,,,"They offer sweet and savory toppings, and we ordered one sweet and one savory one to share. For the sweet one, we chose Nutella Chocolate Spread & Ricotta Cheese. It was super creamy, sitting on top of a fluffy, doughy, dense yet airy crumpet. It was really good!"
,,,,,"For savory one, we got Egg of Smoked Salmon Cream Cheese. I was surprised how creamy it was! It was almost whipped, light and fluffy, with a really good smoked salmon flavor. "
,,,,,"I didn't really know what to expect before I visited, but they totally lived up to my expectation and more. I thought we would need more than two crumpets to share, since they are not big. But, they are quite filling! A great little breakfast, and the price tag was very affordable too. The quality was high, and super delicious."
,,,,,"A coworker from LA suggested I come here when I told him I was visiting Seattle, and I am so glad I did! Got the crumpet with homemade lemon curd and ricotta cheese and aaaah, so delicious! I would definitely have this for breakfast in the morning or as a snack with tea. $5.30 so not inexpensive..."
,,,,,"Some seating area so this could be a quick afternoon pit stop. Their savory options look great for breakfast/lunch, I'd love to come back. Would highly recommend."
,,,,,"I picked up 3 crumpets to share on my recent visit - rob's favorite, the vermont and lemon curd with ricotta. They were all pretty great, crumpets were nice and fluffy and all of the toppings worked well together."
,,,,,"I visited so many disappointing restaurants in Seattle, but I'm happy to say that this place lived up to the hype!"
,,,,,The green egg with cheddar is amazing! It's green from pesto and the cheese is the perfect compliment. On a nice hot crumpet it was fabulous. And the crumpet? Fresh and would have been delicious on its own.
,,,,,"I'm not a big coffee drinker, so it was nice to find a place with a good tea selection. Instead of giving you hot water and a bag, they brew their teas from loose leaf and you serve yourself from carafes on the counter. I miss being to set my own tea strength, but loved being able to have multiple cups of different varieties."
,,,,,My only regret is that I didn't have enough room for a sweet crumpet too.
,,,,,"Every time we come to Seattle, we visit this place. The food is great for breakfast. The only suggestion I would have it to open up the menu to different things. It feel like it's the same ingredients mixed into one another. A bacon option would be nice. Here is what we got this time:"
,,,,,"- Pesto, Tomato and Parm - Really fresh and light. "
,,,,,"- Cream Cheese, Maple Butter and Walnuts - Delicious. Sweet, but not too sweet. All the right textures. Didn't take any pictures of this one. Sorry. "
,,,,,- Kids Option - Normal. Peanut Butter and a type of jam. 
,,,,,"- Ham, English Cheese and Tomato - scrumptious. The cheese was slightly different enough to consider it different than cheddar. "
,,,,,"Overall, it was a great place. Always is. The crumpets should be soft and fluffy. This shop always delivers."
,,,,,"Not overbearing, but has flavor. Portions are not large, so if you're planning on trying many types of food, this is a good place to stop by."
,,,,,"How I miss this shop. Last time I ate here was in the winter, but I enjoyed it so much I kept going back. "
,,,,,"If you go, definitely try one of their egg crumpet variations. I usually have the one with cheese and call it a day, but my friend (who usually visits with me) enjoys the addition of a tomato. The honey crumpet is also wonderfully delicious. Paired with coffee, it makes for a lovely brunch."
,,,,,"This place regularly attracts lines (seating is limited and the interior narrow), so account for that when you decide to check it out."
,,,,,"First time having a crumpet, I would describe it as a mix between a biscuit and an English muffin. Was it good? Ya I guess. Would I have it again? Probably not. The service was efficient, the plates they gave you are super cheap and flimsy, and the chai was below average."

,,,,,"I do not think I have ever had a crumpet until I went here, and until I finally visit England, this spot will have to do since I have never had a bad crumpet here yet!"
,,,,,"A nice small establishment in the area of Pike Place Market, The Crumpet Shop is a nice gem.  Going here for breakfast at least once during a trip to Seattle is almost a must for me.  When you look over the menu, they have a nice selection of sweet and savory crumpets, so depending on what you are craving, I feel there is something for you!"
,,,,,Some of my favorites include the following: 
,,,,,Green Egg & Ham
,,,,,Green Egg & English Cheese
,,,,,Egg with Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese
,,,,,Pesto with English Cheese & Tomato
,,,,,Nutella & Ricotta Cheese
,,,,,Butter & Honey
,,,,,The crumpets are made well and maintain a good amount of crunch and crispness to them even though they have various toppings on them.  
,,,,,"For drinks, they have a nice coffee and tea selection.  There is limited seating in here as the establishment is not bit, but people will not linger for too long."
,,,,,I cannot wait till my next crumpet from here!
,,,,,"Pass this place up and you will have done yourself a great disservice! Nothing short of amazing- my husband and I enjoyed these crumpets- I a sweet one, he a savory and we both loved them. They were the perfect light breakfast to get us going for the day..hot, fresh, delicious! This establishment was also following all Covid protocol. Don't miss out in this hidden gem!"
,,,,,"I finally made it to the Crumpet Shop during my last trip to Seattle this past summer, and it was just okay in my book. Nothing wrong with their famous crumpets, but I guess I was just expecting something more with all of the 5-star reviews. I ordered the Rob's favorite, which was a crumpet topped with green egg, cheese, tomato, and smoked salmon cream cheese. I prefer savory over sweet, but perhaps I should've opted for a sweet crumpet since this one was just okay. The crumpet itself also didn't taste ""hot"" or ""toasty"" as written on their menu, and I'm pretty sure the eggs were microwaved because I didn't see a stove where they were preparing the food. It's also not that cheap at $6.80, but I've come to expect the slightly higher prices in Pike Place Market and just Seattle in general."
,,,,,Still worth a try if you're visiting from out of town just to see what the hype is about. I suggest you go early though since it's super popular and the store itself is small with only few tables. Hopefully you can grab a table by the window so you can see the crumpet-making in action!
,,,,,"After being disappointed with the Piroshky, we decided to hit up our second food stop, the crumpet shop. We got the most popular, maple butter, and was pleasantly surprised by it. We didn't have much hopes for this as it was described as ""an English muffin with more holes"". But turned out to be pretty good! We really enjoyed our short break in the cafe as well. It's small but cozy. We didn't have troubles finding a seat because people were finishing their crumpets relatively quickly and moving on with their adventures. Although it is good, I wouldn't come out of my way to get this unless I was also visiting pikes"
,,,,,"AMAZING little shop in Pike Place. I had no idea what a crumpet was before coming here. They are small unsweetened round cakes with a bread-like texture, almost like an English muffin. They sell them with both sweet and savory toppings."
,,,,,"I first tried the salmon cream cheese with egg. The crumpet was so delicious I had to order another. I then got one with lemon ricotta, and it tasted like heaven. Their lemon curd is perfect, and the slight saltiness of"
,,,,,"the ricotta balances out the sweetness so nicely. The crumpets themselves are crispy, buttery and moist. Definitely coming back to try all the toppings! I'm particularly curious about the green eggs and ham."
,,,,,"Probably the best crumpet I've ever had!  My wife (Jo) wanted a crumpet and heard of The Crumpet Shop in the Pike Place Market.  We headed over to enjoy the many shops and picked up a few things before we had out Crumpet.  Jo picked the basil, tomato with Parmesan cheese crumpet (we split it which was not a good idea..). The basil sauce was so fresh and the crumpet warm and so yummy with the slice of fresh tomato and a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.  Delightful!"
,,,,,"My girlfriend and I visited this place a few years ago. Our minds were blown!! It was so soft on the top and perfectly crispy on the bottom. We got their ricotta cheese, honey and walnut crumpet So delicious, we never forgot about it. Whenever we talk about Seattle, we always bring this place up! We stopped by today before they closed and once again, they never disappoint."
,,,,,This is an amazing place for breakfast.
,,,,,"Rob's favourite tomato on smoked salmon cream cheese and walnut , honey and ricotta cream cheese are must try. I always buy one savoury and sweet crumpet . "
,,,,,They make fresh crumpets (made from unsweetened batter ).
,,,,,"Crumpets in the morning, crumpets in the evening, crumpets at dinner time,"
,,,,,I'd have crumpets every day if there wasn't such a damn line.
,,,,,"I kid, kind of. There is usually a line, but to their credit, they do a decent job at keeping it moving. I also ordered a small cup of fresh squeezed orange juice and holy chalupa was it delicious."
,,,,,"I had a hard time deciding on which crumpets to get - they all sound SO good, but we ended up choosing 4 - I think the pretty plain one, with just honey and butter, one with nutella and ricotta, one with smoked salmon (hallo, it's seattle - the land of salmon), and I don't remember the other one, but only because we probably inhaled it in 2 seconds flat. "
,,,,,"I want to say for the four of these, plus orange juice and coffee, it was maybe $25. And so, so so good. The only reason I docked it a star is because of the wait and that it's cramped a little inside, which is where we opted to eat. But still, GO TO THERE. Blow your trumpet for the crumpet. Nom."
,,,,,"My first stop every time I'm in Seattle. I can't tell you how many times I have been here since that first time years ago. They check every box that makes up a 5 star review- every box that makes me a customer for life. Consistently great food- it is the same every time. Warm and welcoming staff. Price is right. You cannot go wrong with anything you have from them. Do yourself a favor and go here. Groats- their oatmeal- is deeeeelicious, go early if you want some. They run out pretty quick. Lemon curd and ricotta is theeeee best! I hope you get to enjoy these little gems."
,,,,,Ps... unlimited hot tea refills
,,,,,Pls... lemon curd that they sell in the jar is NOT what is served in store

,,,,,I've been going to the crumpet shop since I was a little boy in the 70's. They're fresh made crumpets are delicious and can be served in a number of creative ways or take a bag with you for the road.
,,,,,First time having a crumpet. It's similar to a English muffin. There are sweet and savory choices of crumpets. I ordered a maple butter and walnut crumpet which was delicious. It is a bit pricey for the portion and they do get busy in the mornings. The maple butter was the perfect sweetness and went well with the cream cheese. The bottom of the crumpet actually stayed crispy with all the toppings which made it even tastier. The latte was a bit on the darker side but I like how it did not cost more for alternative milks.
,,,,,"Such a cute little bakery shop right at the edge of Pike Place! The lines get super long so try to go earlier? We stopped by for a quick breakfast and grabbed two savory crumpets (ham + cheese and smoked salmon) and one sweet version (raspberry). I liked all! Even the coffee! It is a super small shop though so know that every movement you make there will be someone already eyeing your seat. Staff was also super nice so come visit, they need to share more nice with everyone!"
,,,,,Service and food was amazing! Usually tourist areas are less in terms of customer service but every single person working today (4/23/21) was super nice. The food was amazing as well.
,,,,,Nice small shop.  Very quick service.  Ordered a maple butter crumpet and a latte with oat milk.  A good stop for a quick bite.
,,,,,"The kids love this place. Every trip to Seattle, bags come back for snacking. The goods are fresh baked and don't last long. Perfect with a sweet or savory topping. We have always had excellent customer service for years. We have even been waiting customers in some of the busiest times and still have never seen poor service or lacking in cleanliness. Thank you Crumpet Fam!"
,,,,,My first foray into Crumpets. It is a seemingly easy to do dish that comes out hot and ready to be consumed for breakfast. I got the smoked salmon one and was not disappointed! Definitely recommend for a quick bite during breakfast or even for brunch.
,,,,,Enjoy some coffee after and a nice walk along Pike Place!
,,,,,"This little gem has a special spot in my heart, it's my first stop the moment we land in Seattle. "
,,,,,"Walking into this warm and delightful little shop, there's always a line but you move briskly through. They have fresh scones on display towards the register and homemade jams to enjoy at home, gooseberry is my personal favorite but hubby sticks to their strawberry. "
,,,,,"They offer an array of toppings for these freshly made crumpets from savory delights to buttered sweet and sinful bites. I must have both, of course with a cup of the house made chai with fresh ginger to wash it all down. The tea runs out fairly quickly so be mindful to make it your first stop at Pikes Place. "
,,,,,The sweet crumpets : always buttered....from there I adore the ricotta drizzled with honey and topped with crushed walnuts...I wish they offered dates with this. Regardless it's by far amazing! The peanut butter with jam is my second go to. 
,,,,,"The savory crumpets: with English cheese, of course! On top of the I love the egg/jalapeño peppers on cream cheese. The tomato and smoked salmon is also delish. "
,,,,,Hubby loves their green eggs and game with a double espresso. 
,,,,,This is our first stop the minute we land in Seattle.
,,,,,Best place to try crumpets -
,,,,,Egg on smoked salmon cream cheese.
,,,,,Pesto ricotta & tomato is really good.
,,,,,Egg on cream cheese.
,,,,,Best!!
,,,,,"Yesss, this place is a treat. For starters when do you get a fresh crumpet? Me, never. The closest comparison (Which they can explain better and say is not) is like an amazing upgrade from an English muffin. The staff was very friendly explaining the difference, what is popular and savory vs sweet. "
,,,,,You get to watch them make the crumpets fresh. 
,,,,,I suggest getting a sweet and savory to explore both taste. 
,,,,,"My only suggestion would be, please add some almond or coconut milk substitute."
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"I'm a huge scone fan, never had a crumpet, but I'm so glad my first crumpet was from here, and ironically enough I did not get to try one of their scones, hopefully next visit because I cannot wait to come back. The crumpets taste great, soft, spongy, and fresh, and the toppings they have are just amazing. They have sweet and savory, so perfect for any meal. My favorite was the ricotta, honey and walnuts. The only problem is, I could probably eat 4 of them in one sitting. I also took home a jar of their maple cream, omg I can put that stuff on anything."
,,,,,"Every single trip to Seattle is not complete without a stop at Pike Place Market and my favorite local spot, The Crumpet Shop! A favorite of tourists and Seattleites alike, this is a must-visit in my book! "
,,,,,"Despite the long stretches of time in-between my visits to the Emerald City, it's always nice to see familiar and friendly faces at The Crumpet Shop. Every single time I've visited the shop, Rob, the Crumpet Shop owner has been there, either helping ring people up, prepping orders, or in the back making fresh crumpets! I appreciate that no matter how busy it gets, he tries to talk to every customer, ask them about their day, their travel plans, and of more often than not, explain what exactly a crumpet is. "
,,,,,"The shop itself is cozy, with a few tables and bar seating inside. There are adorable decorations and art up on the walls, and a handwritten menu up front. If you'd like, they also have mugs, marmalades and loose leaf teas available for purchase! If you're visiting on a weekend or holiday, try and get there earlier rather than later--sometimes they sell out!"
,,,,,"Whether you're into a sweets or a savory dishes, there's a crumpet for you! All the crumpets are delicious, and I usually get a sweet crumpet and a savory one. Choose from yummy toppings like the classic butter and fresh marmalade, Nutella, English cheese, eggs, ham, pesto, salmon cream cheese and more! My personal favorites are the crumpet topped with butter and strawberry marmalade and the crumpet topped with egg, English cheese and tomato! Goes great with their teas, many of which are self-serve and unlimited refills! I recommend The Irish Breakfast tea."
,,,,,"If you like scones, their scones are also out of this world. Many of us imagine scones as the dry crumbly stuff, but The Crumpet Shop Scones are a little different! They come in rounds or by the slice, and are moist and spongey! "
,,,,,"I cannot talk about The Crumpet Shop enough. It truly is a local gem, and all it's popularity and success is well-deserved! I usually even order a couple of fresh crumpets to-go to take back with me to California. You can freeze them and toast them later, and they're just as good!"
,,,,,"The wait was pretty quick. Highly recommend getting Rob's favorite - it is very filling and the salmon cream cheese was BOMB! I think the green egg was just okay, I didn't really taste much difference in it."
,,,,,This place gets quite crowded with both the locals and tourists alike.  I've enjoyed some great tasting crumpets and iced tea each time I've been here.  Folks here are very sweet and helpful in describing and suggesting the types of crumpets available.   Wonderful quaint shop for breakfast or brunch.  Love the green eggs and tomato crumpet and unlimited iced tea...  Bought the maple butter and lemon curd to take home and they were delicious...
,,,,,"This was out second time visiting Seattle and we saw this crumpet shop. We walked in because we had never had a crumpet before and were intrigued to try one. WOW! We split one, but easily could have gotten two because they are so good. If you have never gotten one, I highly recommend this place. It was so good! We got preserves on our and it was fantastic and warm, perfect coupled with the cold and rainy Seattle day."
,,,,,"This is a popular stop in pikes place market. It's a small, quaint little shop where they make the crumpets fresh. They have a large variety of toppings you can put on your crumpets from sweet to savory. The crumpets themselves were good - I'd recommend stopping of you're a big fan, but otherwise I'm not sure it's worth the hype (or the line). "
,,,,,"The inside is small - so difficult to find a good place to sit. The eggs for the egg crumpets are actually microwaved which is a little shocking. The service was good - but nothing noteworthy. If I came back, I'd probably get a classic crumpets with just jelly because that would let the crumpets shine and not be masked by average toppings."
,,,,,"Welcome to my first ever crumpet experience. This is a divey kind of place, but it's got charm. Weathered, but homey. I opted for a savory crumpet and it was delicious. The closest thing I can liken a crumpet to is an arepa. It was stick to your bones warming and left me curious what a sweet crumpet tastes like. I'll have to check it out next time I'm back in Seattle."
,,,,,"My friends and I wanted to try something light, yet different on our last day in Seattle and we found The Crumpet Shop on yelp. Wasn't exactly sure what a crumpet was when I first came in, but I'm definitely a fan! "
,,,,,"The owner (I'm assuming) of the shop was extremely friendly and welcoming, which made our experience so much more worthwhile. He briefly explained what a crumpet was and the different menu options since it was our first time there. There is a vast array of items to choose from, whether you're feeling like eating something savory or sweet (or maybe both!). "
,,,,,"I ordered the honey, walnuts, and ricotta cheese crumpet and my friend ordered Rob's favorite and we shared the two. The honey, walnuts, and ricotta cheese crumpet was light and just the perfect amount of sweetness. The walnuts added a nice texture to the fluffy crumpet and creamy ricotta cheese. Rob's favorite was also really good! I really liked how smoked salmon was incorporated into the cream cheese. The tomato added a nice fresh taste as well. Both crumpets were simple, but so satisfying. "
,,,,,"All in all, I would definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!"
,,,,,"Cute shop with delicious crumpets. I stopped in about an hour before closing on a Saturday (so of course the scones were all sold out), but I was very happy with my crumpet/honey combo. "
,,,,,"It's located right in the heart of Pike's Place, so definitely expect a crowd. There's not much seating available, so plan accordingly. The staff were lovely."
,,,,,10 starzz on Yelp X10... if you want mamas hospitality from the ingredients to the service the crumpets are the best in the country. Thank you to all the staff for the kind and genuine service. I ate here twice this morning.
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"My first crumpet experience! They have a lot of options for both savory and sweet crumpets.  My wife and I tried 2 sweet and 2 savory. All 4 flavors were DELISH! I want to go back to try the rest.  Personally I have a sweet tooth, but I actually enjoyed the savory flavors more!"
,,,,,Savory crumpets that are topped with a variety of topping that make a great breakfast or lunch.  Plenty of options to choose from and is located at Pike Place Market. The staff are friendly and the food is quality. A must try!
,,,,,I had been to The Crumpet Shop on my first trip to Seattle and I wanted to come back on this trip. I was walking with the baby when I saw this place and there were no lines. I walked in the door but realized that it is pretty small and there were a couple of steps and I had no way to keep a stroller standing. One of the servers saw me and came to help pull up the stroller in the shop and was very friendly.
,,,,,On to the crumpets. There were many options and I ordered a basic crumpet with ricotta and strawberry preserve. It was warm and yummy. Even Baby R. loved the strawberry preserve. The fresh orange juice was refreshing. A little sour but was good.
,,,,,I got a crumpet to go for hubby and he seemed to like it OK.
,,,,,I wish I had more time to try the scones and tea but I will keep it for next time.
,,,,,Fantastic. I could not more highly recommend any to go breakfast place in the city. Fantastic prices for the quality of food.
,,,,,Pretty good!! I got one of the sweet ones. Petty tasty. Don't think you could go wrong
,,,,,"I wish they had a location like this near San Fransisco, I would go all the time! I've never had a crumpet before and loved both the sweet and savory ones. Think of them like an english muffin, but more spongy and moist. We came here bright and early at 7am and got to eat a hot fresh batch."
,,,,,"We ordered 3 different crumpets: ham cheese and egg, tomato pesto and mozzarella, and lemon ricotta crumpet. The lemon ricotta crumpet is a must, its very custardy and tart, but the sweetness counteracts so well with the neutral ricotta spread on the base of the crumpet. My second favorite was the tomato, pesto, mozzarella crumpet because it was light and refreshing yet filling at the same time. Their pesto sauce was really great and flavorful, it added a great richness to the dish."
,,,,,"Keep in mind, this is not a hearty meal by any meals. Crumpets themselves are pretty light, especially if you have one. But paired with the right topping, they're perfectly portioned and a great way to start your morning with a different kind of breakfast pastry. I recommend getting two different ones if you want to be full and one for a snack."
,,,,,"Tasty, eclectic, easy to grab. Nice staff and great location. Accessible out of the way and not crowded."
,,,,,So the smoked salmon crumpet with cucumber slices and tabasco is a slice of heaven. 
,,,,,"Their logo is so cute too! But seriously, they make high quality food, and have excellent loose leaf teas and local coffee. "
,,,,,"I think this place is one of the hidden gems in Seattle- it is one of those places everyone loves, and no one regrets. Everyone who goes there comes back eventually!"
,,,,,"This place is great and the crumpets remind me of when I visited London (very authentic). I honestly could've eaten breakfast here EVERYDAY that I was in Seattle. Crumpets are fresh, tea was delicious and they even make fresh baked scones... to die for! The guy at the front window was very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly!"
,,,,,"I made a beeline here for breakfast our first morning in Seattle, armed with all the wonderful reviews I had read on yelp and various blogs. The place is cute, like a mom and pop coffee shop. I ordered the ""Rob's Favorite"", which is a crumpet with green eggs, english cheese, and tomato on a smoked salmon spread. What freaked me out was that after I ordered I realized that the egg was being cooked in a microwave. Turns out when it was served it tasted just like that, a breakfast made in a microwave. That sub-par taste masked any great taste that the freshly baked crumpet might have had."
,,,,,"I'd be interested to come back and try one of the crumpets with a topping on it that didn't have to be microwave-cooked, but I'd say steer away from any of the egg options."
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"First off, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with this establishment. The fact that they use microwaves to heat up things like cheese and ham is just sad. I watched as the worker put cheese in a bowl, threw it in a microwave, then poured that melted microwaved cheese on top of the crumpet. Truly disappointed in that. Yes, I own a microwave and use it when I'm warming up leftovers. But a restaurant? Pumping out food per order? They could at least use an oven or a conveyor belt toaster or even just a regular toaster. But a microwave?! For the price they charge for a crumpet, they should be investing in an option that's healthier than a microwave. They provide healthier options like organic honey, yet the microwave.. still irks me. Imagine going to your favorite restaurant and they have absolutely no ovens...just a microwave heating up that dish you love so much. "
,,,,,"But aside from that rant, the crumpet was actually good. I tried the Vermont with maple butter, cream cheese, and walnuts. I didn't choose a crumpet that needed the use of the microwave. The crumpet was toasty (I'm assuming they used a toaster) and the maple butter was mildly sweet that paired well with cream cheese and walnuts. It was a nice savory warm dish for the late morning. I actually enjoyed it very much. "
,,,,,"The dish itself deserves 5 stars, but I truly cannot see a restaurant with a microwave as the main heating element be worthy of 4 or 5 stars. A simple conveyor belt toaster (even Quiznos has them) would not only toast the crumpet, but melt the cheese and heat the ham and warm up other pieces. Overall I would come back for the Vermont crumpet but the microwave is just a sad sad option that a highly rated restaurant could easily avoid."
,,,,,"Have you tried crumpets? They are richer and puffier than English muffins. For my first visit, I ordered eggs with jalapeños and orange marmalade crumpet. The eggs were deliciously done, filled with cheese in every bite. And the crumpet! Oh so delicious with a hint of sourness and a bit of crunchiness. The orange marmalade had a little more bitterness than expected. Keep in mind, this isn't a place if you are expecting a heavy breakfast or brunch. The crumpet portion is good, certainly keeps you full for 1-2 hours. Very good coffee! "
,,,,,Parking - street / paid parking only
,,,,,Payments - some issues with specific credit cards on the day I visited.
,,,,,"One of Pike Place's best spots - worth investing your time in this queue. Definitely try their savory options. My favorite is the classic egg-ham-cheese-jalapeno crumpet. I also liked their signature Vermont crumpet. You can also try their Green Egg too. You'll love it and believe me, one is more than enough to keep your tummy full!"
,,,,,Cute coffee shop with fresh and delicious crumpets! Their house made Chai tea is one of the best I've tasted! I ordered a hot Chai tea latte made with hemp milk and my sister tried a cold chair tea latter with hemp milk as well.
,,,,,"We tasted a crumpet with butter and honey, a crumpet with fresh berry jam, and a crumpet with lemon spread. All of them were delicious in their own way, but the one with butter and honey was my favorite because it wasn't too sweet and it was naturally flavored!"
,,,,,"The staff are very friendly and helpful! If you aren't sure what to order, they will help you decide and you can't go wrong because everything was delicious!"
,,,,,Seating area is adequate. Access to restore via key that they have. Very clean and cute restaurant!
,,,,,Line moves quickly. Service is good. Wait time is about 15 minutes from line to receiving food.
,,,,,"Pesto with English cheese - I love pesto and they were very generous with the pesto. The cheese was good and the bread was soft and warm in the middle, while slightly crispy on the edges."
,,,,,Portions are good for a smaller breakfast. It was worth trying once. Save the return visits for other locations in Pike Market.
,,,,,ATMOSPHERE = N/A as they only had outdoor seating.
,,,,,SERVICE = FIVE STARS (great)
,,,,,FOOD = THREE STARS (OK)
,,,,,OVERALL = FOUR STARS (good)
,,,,,The two of us started our afternoon at Pike Place Market with a light lunch at the long - established Crumpet Shop wedged into a narrow storefront on 1st Ave.
,,,,,SERVICE (FIVE STARS = Great)
,,,,,"Amazingly, there was no line when we sauntered up to review the menu. The gregarious cashier (possibly the owner) answered all our questions and explained they were sold out of the salmon cream cheese spread :(."
,,,,,"We ordered our food and sat at one of the three small tables on the sidewalk and people watched until another staff person delivered our crumpets and tea. He said if we wanted utensils, he would return with them. He also explained most customers ate the crumpets out of hand. We declined the utensils."
,,,,,FOOD (THREE STARS = OK)
,,,,,Our order:
,,,,,Egg and English Cheese on Ham = $6.90
,,,,,Green Eggs (Pesto) on Ham w/ added cheese = $7.25
,,,,,Egg and Jalapeño on Ham = $6.40
,,,,,Iced Tea = $3.25
,,,,,"All crumpets were toasted and slathered in butter. A thick slice of ham forms a base for the eggs, which are described as scrambled, but they appeared almost steamed. No matter, the eggs were good, and the cheese was perfectly melted. Each crumpet (with toppings) was cut into two pieces to make them more manageable to eat."
,,,,,"Despite the different ingredients in the eggs (plain, pesto & Jalapeño) they all tasted pretty much the same. While the pesto eggs were most definitely green, there wasn't much pesto flavor. As for the Jalapeño eggs, there was more crunch and texture than taste. Perhaps adding seasonings to each egg topping would differentiate them more. As such, the next time we go, we may stick with the plain egg topping."
,,,,,"In retrospect, we should have taken the utensils. The eggs were hot, and sat tall on the ham and crumpet.  It was tricky to stuff into your mouth for complete bites. Plus, the butter from the crumpets got all over your hands. We used a lot of napkins eating our lunch. We polished off our crumpets quickly and were ready to stroll through Pike Place Market."
,,,,,"Lunch for two, out the door, with tax and tip: $32. The Crumpet Shop is a good place to stop for a quick snack or a light lunch."
,,,,,"We LOVE our crumpets!  This is my go-to breakfast spot in Pike Place Market, as it's unique and one of a kind!"
,,,,,"They offer sweet and savory choices and delicious teas (some bottomless) for any pallet.  If you're a purest and only want butter or marmalade, they've got you covered.  If you're adventurous and seek a salmon spread with a cuke and mater, they're your cup of tea. "
,,,,,"For me, my favorites are whatever I'm feeling.  I LOVE the maple butter crushed walnut and ham/cheese egg."
,,,,,"They also have a great display so you can see just how they're made, and many of their offerings for sale on the end wall of the cafe. "
,,,,,It may seem like a small space but people move quickly and it'll always be WORTH. IT.
,,,,,"Crumpets, pinkies up!"
,,,,,The wait here is bananas on weekends. The line moves at a super snail pace. Took 30 minutes to order for a line of 10-15 people. 
,,,,,Touristy spot. Inside was super packed on a Saturday at 10 am.
,,,,,"2 entrances, one on the side street and one is up the stairs from Pike Market. The line starts through the Pike entrance. "
,,,,,The Vermont w/ Cream Cheese & Walnuts - $5.95 - Basically an english muffin with cream cheese and nuts. Cream cheese was creamy. Maple butter was sweet and rich. 
,,,,,Would pick a bagel over a crumpet. Worth a try but not worth the wait.
,,,,,"Vegans - there are reviews on here saying if you get one with preserves it is vegan and you need to beware - ask for no butter! I had no idea there would be butter on it and when I opened up the box I saw it dripping down the sides. Turned around to ask for another without butter and they had just put the closed sign up. Sucks, $5 down the drain and it just got thrown out :( was so excited to try!"
,,,,,A local friend recommended that I try the food at this shop since I was staying at a place less than three blocks away. I can't say I was familiar with crumpets because the time I have spent in the UK has been limited. There was a solid queue of customers waiting to place an order when I arrived on a late weekend morning. Seating inside was limited and completely full.
,,,,,"After about 15 minutes in line to look over the menu, I selected Rob's Favorite which seemed to be a popular choice. It was a hot toasty crumpet covered with a green egg, English cheese, and tomato on a smoked salmon cream cheese spread. The crumpet was so much softer than any English muffin that you can buy here in the States. I loved the salmon spread as this city is fortunate to have such a tasty fish as a plentiful nearby resource."
,,,,,"In hindsight, I should have also bought a sweet crumpet along with the savory one since I was bringing it back to eat at my rental. Overall, I rated this unique experience four stars."
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Their crumpets and teas are the very best. This is one of the finest places in the city, I've been visiting them since the early nineties. Lady week we ordered crumpets to go, but couldn't find a single safe place to sit and eat them. When we stopped on a random staircase away from people to eat the fresh crumpets, we discovered one was missing. We called and they delivered the missing crumpet to our location on the stairs off post alley! Never had someone in food service go out of their way like that. I highly recommend."
,,,,,"I saw that this place had pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a go since the line to order was quite short. Prices were reasonable and there was a nice, healthy selection, so I decided on the smoked salmon. Even thought I only ordered one, it took around 15 minutes to receive my crumpet and once I opened it to eat, I found a hair on it. I was ravenous, so I took off the cucumber that had the hair and was happy with the crumpet. But two stars for the pick-up wait and the hair."
,,,,,"I hate myself for not trying this place sooner. I always thought crumpets were scones, and I do not like scones. I finally tried it after hearing someone say crumpets were more like english muffins, and oh my god, I have been missing out!!! Turns out crumpets ARE more like english muffins and the ones here are DELICIOUS AND ADDICTING! The crumpet is soft, chewy, and buttery. I tried the ham and egg one and it was simple but amazing. The crumpet was the best part and I wanted to go back for more of just that. "
,,,,,I can't wait to try their other ones next time I'm in town. I really can't believe I've been to Seattle a bunch of times before and never tried it. It's right in Pike Place Market so easily accessible and tends to get crowded at times. The line moves fast though!
,,,,,"i'm so happy my friend took me here while we were in seattle! it was so good, i went back twice! my friend suggested to try savory and sweet. we ended up getting rob's favorite. this was really good. i love egg, pesto, tomato, so what's not to love...it also has smoked salmon cream cheese. i actually got this dish again before i left. as for the sweet crumpet, we got the walnut, honey & ricotta cheese. this was really delicious too. i would def get it again when i go back to seattle!"
,,,,,Crumpets aren't anything that special. It's just an open faced sandwich. Plenty of other better stuff to get in Pike's Place.
,,,,,"Unfortunately, we weren't impressed with this shop. We tried a hot chai tea latte and a crumpet with lemon curd. Our chai tasted watered down and was in need of more flavor. Our crumpet was plain and tough to eat. However, the staff was very friendly and nice. The shop was clean and well kept."
,,,,,One of a kind for this kind of food. Great and fun place. They can get busy but try to move through it fast.
,,,,,"Crumpets are like English muffins ... except they're more British -- pasty, plain, and porous ... and bloody brilliant with jam and a cuppa tea."
,,,,,Me and my mates were knackered from gallivanting around Pikes Place Market looking for some bits 'n bobs when we stumbled upon The Crumpet Shop. Fancy a bit of tea and crumpets?
,,,,,"I'm no Little Miss Muffet, but ... crumpets? Nobody gets crumpets! You gotta know how to play cricket or curtsy to get crumpets. Tell me more about these chewy dense spongy unsweetened griddle cakes (made from milk, flour, and yeast) turned tasty when toasted and topped with butter, honey, marmalade, or other sweet and savory toppings oozing into every little bubbly nook and cranny. "
,,,,,"Of course, you don't need to be a British princess (or curtsy) to get crumpets at The Crumpet Shop. The little store features unlimited tea refills and crumpets for days. There are so many lovely crumpets -- hot, sweet, savory, and egg - it's a crumpocalypse."
,,,,,The Crumpet Shop closes Tuesdays and other days at 3:00 or 4:00. So plan for an early tea time or breakfast. The bloke behind the counter was friendly and full of energy. He had crumpet tips and scone suggestions throughout our wait in the line. He convinced me to try a trio:
,,,,," * Egg, English Cheese, and Jalapeño Crumpet "
,,,,, * Butter and Honey Crumpet
,,,,, * Fresh-baked Scone with Homemade Lemon Curd
,,,,,All three aced the taste test. I'm a Crumpet Shop crumpet fan.
,,,,,Cheerio!
,,,,,"Never tried a crumpet before, but I'm glad I did here.  There was a line this morning and finding a seat is a challenge, but things move pretty quick.  This is a good stop if you're sampling a lot of the foods in the area because the portions are reasonable and still pack a punch.  We opted for Rob's favorite, which had a good helping of pesto and tomato.  Looks wise, it wasn't all that impressive, and it's kind of expensive for what it is.  But it's worth trying and if you snag a table, you can hang out here for a bit and watch the world go by."
,,,,,My first crumpet of my life - thank goodness it was from here as it was extremely delicious. Got the Vermont. Yes. Yes. Yes. Cappuccino was also great
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Drool! We love the crumpets here. It was a mouthful of buttery moist deliciousness. We ordered the egg, cheddar in crumpet and bf got the egg, cheddar, tomato on crumpet. We didn't have room for the scone but it looked very good! Will need to come back and try. "
,,,,,We highly recommend it here.
,,,,,"If you're like me, still wondering what exactly a ""crumpet"" is, then please please check out the crumpet shop!! Firstly, crumpets are delicious and they need to be more mainstream in the US. Secondly, I never knew how many toppings you could put on a crumpet! Craving something sweet? Try butter and honey or Nutella and ricotta. Want savory instead? How about pesto, eggs, and ham? "
,,,,,Don't let the (usually) long line deter you. They are super efficient at cranking out crumpets and there's plenty of merch to look at while you wait!
,,,,,"I was telling my bf we were coming here and his first question was, what's a crumpet?"
,,,,,"Good question. When I said it was similar to an English muffin his enthusiasm did not improve. But once I let him choose what we ordered, all was well. "
,,,,,"We got the egg, cheese and ham crumpet and the lemon curd crumpet. "
,,,,,"Egg was slightly overcooked but flavors were great and the crumpets were at their finest. Disappointed they were out of their homemade chai cuz how can you do tea and crumpets without the tea?! I guess I could've had one of their other teas... But they're not the housemade chai... Anyways, great spot, great location, love the vibes, love the price."
,,,,,"Nice inexpensive lunch or breakfast. Sweet or savory crumpet creations, and also try a piece of the scone dessert. Different and tasty."
,,,,,"""Would you like so tea and crumpets? ""Why yes, yes I would."""
,,,,,"One of my friends, Mac_attack, suggested that I come here, and I was quite glad I took her advice. I had the crumpet that came with a Wild Smoked Salmon Spread and cucumbers for $4.15."
,,,,,"These particular type of crumpets were a first for me. I liked them. I liked their texture too. The bottom had a light crisp bottom that actually needed a little force on my fork to break through. As a result, there was that nice chew and crunch, mixed with the softness of the crumpet."
,,,,,"The crumpet tasted good too, but that wild salmon and cream cheese mixture a top was terrific. It definitely tasted of a quality salmon and the mixture maintained that creamy texture of the cream cheese. The sliced cucumbers were fresh and crisp."
,,,,,It was the perfect midday snack.
,,,,,They do damn good food here. 
,,,,,Not an easy place to access but for crying out loud the food is worth the effort. 
,,,,,Do yourself a favor and try it
,,,,,"Great stuff! Been a long time since I've had a really good crumpet. We needed up buying (and eating) way more than we should. We had the salmon and cucumber; ham, egg, and cheese; cheese, egg, and tomato; and a lemon curd. (The lemon curd is also fantastic!) And a wonderful scone with jam to round it all off. And the tea was great, too."
,,,,,"I had no idea what a crumpet was but it sounded good so I knew I needed to try it.  My first time here, I got the wild smoked salmon blended with cream cheese & sliced cucumber.  It was pretty good for a savory option but I think it would have been a lot better if they used actual smoked salmon instead of blending it in the cream cheese.  "
,,,,,"The second day I came back and split a sweet crumpet with walnuts, honey and ricotta and a Robs favorite as the savory option.  (The green egg is pesto)  Both were really good but I definitely can't stop thinking about that sweet crumpet.  Their menu is pretty extensive and if I lived here, I could see myself coming back frequently to try everything."
,,,,,"Even having spent a not insignificant amount of time in the UK and Ireland, I won't pretend for a second to be at all versed on crumpets. After a visit to The Crumpet Shop, I think I might need to change that. "
,,,,,Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?
,,,,,"As is the case with many other spots in the market, the lines can grow long at The Crumpet Shop, but you'll be alright if you time your visit right. On the early side of a beautiful Saturday morning I only ended up waiting about twenty minutes, which wasn't unreasonable. Star. "
,,,,,Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?
,,,,,"$5.95 got me a very dense decked out 'Vermont' crumpet, which was a fair price given this was enough, paired with a coffee, for a nice sweet breakfast. Star. "
,,,,,Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?
,,,,,"This was excellent full stop. The crumpet itself is good enough to eat by itself, but the cheese, honey, and walnuts all came together in a way that made it a wonderful combination of donut and english muffin. Wonderful. Two Stars. "
,,,,,Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?
,,,,,"The one thing that I think would improve The Crumpet Shop and really get me excited to come back is a bit of menu diversity. Yes, the Vermont was fantastic, but what would really send the hype around The Crumpet Shop into overdrive would be a wider range of jellies, jams, and toppings to compliment what's already available. No Star."
,,,,,"I was visiting a friend in Seattle and she insisted on swinging by, and now I'm glad she did. It was a Saturday morning and we probably waited around 5-10 minutes in line to order, and not much longer to get our food. The place was extremely crowded though so it may be difficult to find a table after you order."
,,,,,"I had: walnut honey and ricotta crumpet, smoked salmon cream cheese and cucumber crumpet, scone with lemon curd, and a chai. All of the food was fantastic! I highly recommend sampling at least one savory and one sweet scone. The walnut, honey, and ricotta was such a good combination and I really enjoyed the salmon and cucumber. The scone was also great! There was a lot of lemon curd with it, and I would've preferred a little less."
,,,,, Do yourself a favor and come by and see what the hype is about!

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,"Love this little joint. Located in the historic pike place market. Small, quaint, but packs a great punch with the diverse options of crumpets. Savory and sweet options to go along side vast array of organic loose leaf teas. My personal favorite is the egg, ham, cheese, and diced jalapeño crumpet. Filling and affordable. Staff nice and service quick. Located across the way from a adult novelty shop so some humorous billboards to read while enjoying crumpets! Highly recommend!"
,,,,,YESSSSSSSSSSSS CRUMPET SHOP YESSSS!
,,,,,What a happy accident. As a person who grew up drinking tea with milk and crumpets this place felt like home. 
,,,,,"When we walked in, my eyes were drawn to the freshly made crumpets being made right in front of my eyes. "
,,,,,The smell was second to none. And to see all these golden brown crumpets waiting to be devoured with speciality toppings to choose from. I was in heaven.
,,,,,"I landed on a savory crumpet with pesto, fresh shredded cheese and a large ripe tomato slice. I was ready to hand over my card and the amazing staff said would you like some tea, I did hesitate a bit as we were in the coffee town, she then said ITS TO DIE FOR and endless. So there you go, that was my answer. "
,,,,,"I hopped down to the tea bar and landed on the crumpet shops special blend black tea, added some oat milk and a little sugar and it was beyond perfect. This black tea blend was Soooo good!! The taste was nothing I've had before. I was so happy it was refillable. "
,,,,,Shortly after our crumpets were called out to us. Each bite was amazing and you can taste the freshness of the crumpets. Perfectly toasted and each bite made me want more. We loved the crumpet shop so much we went back twice more!
,,,,,It's not easy to find this place. There are a lot of shops at Pike's Place to distract you. Also the outside entrance is a bit deceiving and looks very small. We only found this place because we saw a weird sign near some stairs and decided to give it a try.
,,,,,"Oh my, the crumpets are amazing. You can get them toasted, as a sandwich bun, savory or sweet. There is a decent variety of flavours, so you probably will be able to find what you like."
,,,,,"I got the smoked salmon crumpet, with cream cheese and cucumber slices on top. It looked very simple, but it was absolutely delicious. The combination just worked so well -- I dare say, even better than most lox bagels in the country."
,,,,,"The store has a limited number of seating, and it's quite crowded. Seems like a lot of people love this little shop -- but give it a try, and you might just find a new favourite store in this market full of little gems!"
,,,,,"My girlfriend is really into it, otherwise it would get three stars. It's just big ass English muffins with some savory and sweet spreads. There's a maple one that was memorable. My gal liked the lemon curd."
,,,,,"The hours are kinda wacko, so it's not entirely convenient. Fun place."
,,,,,"Just no. We saw the amazing reviews and thought we must try this. Got the food very quickly and aside from the crumpet this was far from fresh. The egg and salmon taste like they were scooped from a big tub and were just not good. The ricotta and preservers were fine, nothing special though. The crumpet itself is good and fresh, but everything else ruined it. Once we finally got our coffee after my daughter had to go back up and ask for it. Only to find it was just sitting on their back table ready. It was undrinkable. It had an expired milk taste to it. Overall I highly recommend trying another place for breakfast or at least get coffee somewhere else"
,,,,,"I had no idea what crumpets were and now I am a big fan.   This place is appearently super popular and there is usually a long line (I assume the busy season in summer).  Lucky for me, it is winter now and I was there at 7am right when they opened so I was the first customer.  "
,,,,,"I already looked the menu on yelp and definitely wanted to try ""The Vermont"" with maple butter, cream cheese and walnuts.  It actually takes a while to make it....seems so easy as heating up bagel and put some cream cheese on it but I guess not.  "
,,,,,"First bite...I was not sure if I like it so much....then something happened.  By the third bite, I was in love.  The bottom is crusty, which I was not sure about, but it is a nice contrast to the rest of the piece being chewy.  The texture became so addictive and not to mention what hey put on it was super delicious.  "
,,,,,I was using a knife and fork but I recommend using your hand because the bottome is so crusty I was unable to cut it all the way thru.  
,,,,,I definitelty wanna go back again and try different flavors. I just order one but I definitely could have eaten two for my breakfast.  And this place made me have another bucket list....trying crumpets in England!
,,,,,I saw this on a vlog and we decided to stop by while in Seattle. We split two crumpets we had one with maple butter and one with preserves. They were so delicious. They exceeded my expectations.
,,,,,This place is incredible!! I can't believe I've never been till yesterday. I went with a group of friends and we ordered 8 crumpets. I am so glad we ordered a selection. Every single one was DELICIOUS and uniquely crafted. My favorite was the lemon ricotta. The place is really cute and could be perfect to grab a quick bite or sit and enjoy a friend over crumpets and tea. 
,,,,,It is family owned and the owners son was so personable and kind. We really enjoyed our experience!
,,,,,"This is a cute little place around the pike place market that offers good breakfast (even on the go). The crumpets were good and really hit the spot after walking through the market in the early morning hours when the vendors were still setting up. The egg, cheese, and ham crumpet was good with no complaints but the smoked salmon cream cheese was a little upsetting just because I was expecting actual smoked salmon and not smoked salmon flavored cream cheese but I guess I should've read the menu more clearly. "
,,,,,"Even though we were there before most of the vendors were set up, this place was so busy with almost no room for seating so we just asked for it to go and went back to our place to eat it. The service was good and they try to be really efficient and even remind you to eat your to go order soon because that's when it best served for sure."
,,,,,"I have never seen a crumpet shop specific place before!!! It was extremely exciting. It's one street up from Pike's Place, a very small place with hardly any seating so beware if you come on a rainy day. They have a window where you can watch them pour the crumpet mixture onto the grill and can see all the deliciousness laying out to cool."
,,,,,"My cousins and I got the honey, PB & nutella, egg/ham/cheese, butter, and strawberry jam crumpets. I specifically got the PB & nutella and strawberry jam one. I did have to scrape off the jams because there was SO MUCH. They definitely didn't skimp which I appreciate...better to have more than less."
,,,,,I ended up buying the 6 pack of crumpets and bringing them back to LA with me :)

,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,This is for my experience at the end of February right before Covid.
,,,,,"The Crumpet Shop was one of the highlights of my Seattle trip. The inside is dainty, small, and homey. The workers were super nice to help give recommendations and explain the items on the menu. "
,,,,,Order: 
,,,,,"-The Vermont Maple Butter w/ cream cheese and walnuts: As a person who doesn't like terribly sweet foods, this crumpet had a perfect balance. The crumpet soaked up a lot of the sugar. The cheese added a smooth texture and the walnuts gave it an extra crunch factor. "
,,,,,"-Chai tea: Super gingery and flavorful. It wasn't as creamy as I was expecting, but it is clearly homemade. "
,,,,,"There wasn't a lot of seating so we had to wait a bit, but we got a table right next to where they make the crumpets. It was super cool to watch them fill the batter and flip them!"
,,,,,"Despite my mother being very British, I've never had a crumpet before! I actually had no idea what to expect but the crumpet itself was delicious. Many restaurants in America tend to overuse or misuse ricotta in my opinion, but The Crumpet Shop used just the right amount. It didn't overpower the rest of flavoring and the texture was wonderfully smooth. The wait was a little long, and I'm not sure that Crumpets are my favorite dessert but I would recommend if you haven't been here yet."
,,,,,"Heard a lot of great views of The Crumpet Shop and excited to try as I never had the crumpet before; didn't even know what it is. You order from the store front, then pick up in the back of the restaurant. They have two 2-seat tables around the store. I ordered Rob's Favorite with smoked salmon spread, tomato, and green eggs. The order was completely relatively fast and they provide silverware/hot sauce/napkins with the order. The crumpet was pre-cut in half so easy to share. The bottom of the crumpet was a bit hard. The flavor is on the lighter side, the salmon spread was good but not as savory as I expected. I added hot sauce to the savory crumpet and enhances the flavor.  Would come back to try their sweet crumpets in the future."
,,,,,"My partner and I live Downtown, and we've been going here for over a decade. The staff is quick and friendly--even when very busy. The crumpets are excellent, and we often go just to pick up some sundries, or for a tea and to people watch. We've been through the menu a couple times, and never recall having ever been disappointed. "
,,,,,Truly a cornerstone of Old Seattle.
,,,,,"I really wish they had more vegetarian options and that their crust was more crispy or flavorful. The pesto sauce was just amazinggg. The sweet one was okay, I feel they could do much better with mixing the toppings. They hav elicited options. Worth tasting once to know what the hype is al about but might not visit again"
,,,,,"My friend was SO excited to find crumpets and she was smiling the whole time she ate them. We went around 11 am on a Saturday and it was packed. The wait to order and receive them was a little over 30 minutes, but my friend said it was worth every second. She got the green eggs and ham crumpet and another girl got a crumpet with lemon curd and ricotta. The lemon curd was delicious, but it was a little too heavy on the ricotta."
,,,,,"Quality has gone downhill. I used to love this place and I don't know what happened as of late. Crumpet I last had was hard and thick, more like a southern biscuit. I felt sick after eating one--there was too much butter/oil/fat in it. Food was really poor quality, not coming back."
,,,,,I stop here every time I'm at Pike Place! Crumpets are my perfect rainy day snack  I love that you can get anything from toasted with butter to a full sandwich (a.k.a. I never have an excuse not to). 
,,,,,"Crumpets are comforting. They're cute. They're tasty. They're convenient, and affordable. And don't get my started on crumpets with tea...plus the staff is really nice and they're very fast. "
,,,,,Overall this place is just a Pike Place staple and I high recommend stopping by!
,,,,,"Very light, handmade and delicious crumpets. They have a good menu with many options and also provide you with great recommendations. The portions are good to share with one person, so order more and try different flavors. We loved the hazel nut crumpet and the lemon tart version. A definite stop near the pike place market."
,,,,,"I haven't really had many crumpets before, but these were amazing. The green eggs + lox was so good, as was the honey walnut ricotta. Amazing all round."
,,,,,1503 1st Ave
,,,,,"Seattle, WA 98101"
,,,,,I thought that buying crumpets at Trader Joe's every few months gave me some sort of knowledge on what to expect at this crumpet shop. Nope! 
,,,,,"No disrespect to Trader Joe, but these crumpets schooled me. I ordered a crumpet with egg and English cheese. The crumpet was super buttery and delicious. Yet, it was crisp and had a slight crunch. The egg and cheese were just delicious. I believe the cheese was some sort of cheddar. It's probably my new favorite cheese. Overall, my lone crumpet breakfast was filling but not too heavy. This was really a delightful detail in my trip to Seattle!"
,,,,,"A nice morning treat. There were lots of options to try, some sweet but mostly savory. Not super exciting overall, but it's a great place to find a crumpet!"
,,,,,"If you like english muffins, then a crumpet is the dish you probably have never had and need to start eating. Tucked in a little shop right next to the hustle and bustle of Pike Place Market this place could be easy to pass."
,,,,,Their COVID precautions are well buttoned up with a line on one side to order and pay contactless and another door at the back where they call out orders. There are a couple tables you can sit at and still be spaced out too.
,,,,,"Our order consisted of 2 crumpets. My wife loves a good lemon curd and this was spot on for her. The addition of the ricotta cheese takes it to another level. I like sweet and honey and cheese are my go-tos. With walnuts, local honey, and ricotta cheese this food dish was gone before I knew it. We each got a drink. Fresh squeezed lemonade (she really likes lemons!) and a hot chocolate. Great snack food that won't fill you up but won't leave you disappointed either."
,,,,,Well done!
,,,,,"Delightful little place. You walk up to the window and order either take out or if you choose to eat there, keep an eye out for one of the tiny tables with chairs and snag a seat- they are first come, first serve. We ordered mochas, a ""Rob's favorite,"" crumpet, an egg/cheese/ham one, and split a raspberry one. It was the perfect amount of food for two; we ate at 1 pm and were full until dinner time, 6:30 pm. The crumpets were delicious, flavorful, fluffy but dense and chewy. The English cheddar cheese was very strong and complemented the ham. Hubs loved Rob's favorite. The mochas were delicious. We didn't wait too long for the food in spite of the crowd and all employees were masked up. A+ in my book, would definitely eat there again."
,,,,,"It was good, but it wasn't like great. This place was over hyped to me. Crumpets are like the bottom half of an English muffins but softer and buttery, and you put stuff on top of it. And by stuff, I mean regular stuff like cheese or eggs or spreads. Considering that's all it is, I can't really justify spending $5-7 on that. One of my friends is all into crumpets, so I was imagining something really spectacular, but half an English muffin sandwich is just kinda meh for me. I was with 4 other people who didn't know what crumpets were either. We got 3 to try - pesto with ricotta and tomato for $5.45, walnuts/honey/ricotta cheese for $5.30 and green egg and ham for $6.30. Everyone seemed to like the pesto with ricotta and tomato most and the walnuts/honey/ricotta cheese was a close second. But the crumpets really were no match for the lobster rolls and chowder we got from Pike Chowder Place and croissants and pastries we got from Le Panier. We shared everything buffet style, and the crumpets were the last things to be forcibly finished so that we wouldn't have to carry around leftovers. Glad I tried it, but can't say I'm into it. I think if I were to ever come back, I'd probably try another one from the sweet variety since of the 3 above, my favorite was the walnut/honey/ricotta cheese. If there's a modest line though, I'm not waiting."
,,,,,Always a treat coming here!  I usually pick up a four-pack so I can also enjoy them at home.  Glad that they are back open for business!  You were missed!!
,,,,,"I spotted this place amongst the sea of people at Pike Place marketplace. We decided to eat here on a whim because hey, who doesn't wanna eat glorified bread that's alternate name is a crumpet. I had the ""lifechanger"" crumpet here, it came with walnuts, cream cheese, and honey (I think). The sweetness level was just right, the walnuts added a fantastic texture and brought the sweetness down a level which was great. The crumpet itself was fluffy inside but had a great texture on the outside. Overall I'd come here for a small breakfast to go meal if you're in the area."
,,,,,"I don't know what all the hype is.  This is just an English muffin topped with stuff.  I don't think it's bad, but just not anything that I would wait in a line for.  For the record, I have tried the Lemon Curd, the Pesto, and the Ricotta & Nutella...and they taste exactly like an English muffin topped with *gasp* lemon curd, pesto, ricotta & Nutella."
,,,,,"Yummy! Yummy!  Loved this little crumpet shop in Pike Place Market! One of my favorite places at the Pike Place Market. The crumpets are really good, especially when warm. There are sweet choices and savory. Service was really nice and welcoming. You can watch them make your order. They use very good ingredients. I'm talking about the pesto and the tomato. The crumpets are made right there. You can also take them home, they are packed in bags. Highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,"Love this spot! A little hidden, but with yelp and google map, you will be able to find it without problems! It's around the area of the pike place market. I ordered a smoked salmon crumpet and my husband ordered a simple crumpet with no topping and we both loved it! Also, they hot apple cider was great if you come during fall/winter!"

,,,,,"We have been to the Pike Place Market as visitors from out of town so so many times now...and every time we remember that we need to try The Crumpet Shop is sadly after it is closed for the day...until now!! The Yelp reviews are totally right - this place is so so good! We were only able to try a few things as we had already eaten...but it was out last day on this trip to Seattle so we decided to completely stuff ourselves and so glad we did! We went for variety so we tried two ""savory"" and one ""sweet"" crumpet. We had the crumpet with English Cheese, crumpet with Smoked Salmon and Cucumbers as well as the crumpet with Lemon Curd & Ricotta. WOW!! So much flavor in each one! Each good for their own reasons. The favorite might have been the English cheese as it brought back memories of eating ""English cheese"" and crackers with my mom growing up. She would use the Kraft Old English Cheese sold in jars in the grocery store. Obviously the English Cheese here was better but it was great to have that trip down memory lane!! And a tip that we couldn't take advantage of as we were there 15 min before they closed but you get free refills on hot tea so plan your visit accordingly. They have a few tables right on the sidewalk...but only a few FYI."
,,,,,"I traveled to Seattle for a leisure trip and was looking for a place to have breakfast, and I found the Crumpet Shop. Guys, this place was TO DIE FOR. It was SO delicious, everything was made fresh and it reminded me of my trips to England. My friend and I ordered the traditional lemon curd and ricotta crumpet and a green eggs and ham crumpet, and we truly loved them. "
,,,,,"If you're in Seattle, you definitely need to check this place out! I can't wait to visit once again and go get more delicious crumpets"
,,,,,"Was curious coz I never had a crumpet before so I tried...I liked it!!! Yes it's just like an English muffin with toppings but it's yummy!!! Tried both savoury (Rob's fave with salmon spread, pesto/tomato/Parmesan, egg/tomato/cheese) and sweet (life changer)!!! Will try the lemon curd next time and also the salmon spread with cucumber!!!"
,,,,,"Inexpensive and delicious, The Crumpet Shop is one of the few places I find myself regularly going to whenever I'm back in Seattle. Nothing beats the combination of a Rob's Favorite along with a hot cup of Irish Black Tea or Coffee."
,,,,,One of our usual go-to places in Seattle Pike Place Market area!
,,,,,Loved both the crumpets we ordered (see pictures for details)!!
,,,,,"Get a napkin and wipe the drool from your mouth before you stain your green dress. Even almost a year later, i still find myself practically drooling when i think of The Crumpet Shop!!!"
,,,,,This little shop was absolutely phenomenal!!! Such a unique and delicious place  to enjoy breakfast everyday while we were on vacation here last March. 
,,,,,"The cheddar, tomato  and pesto crumpet is a completely mouth-watering work of delicious, fine art. If you love pesto, you can't go wrong with this choice!!!"
,,,,,"Our other favorite was the  lemon-ricotta crumpet. Such a fabulous combination of zesty tartness with creamy sweetness, refreshing and comfy all intertwined together."
,,,,,The Crumpet Shop blend tea as a latte with vanilla syrup was the absolute  perfect finishing touch to this delightful breakfast food adventure!!!
,,,,,"Half of me wishes soooooooo much that their was a Crumpet Shop here in AZ, buuuuuut the other half of me is greatful that such a delicious temptation is a 4 hr plane ride away. "
,,,,,"If your heading to Pikes Place Market for ypur errands and shopping needs or if your in town for vacation, or just want to get out for breakfast, you can not go wrong with The Crumpet Shop as your choice, UNLESS your allergic to good taste and deliciousess. ;)"
,,,,,"I've never tried a crumpet before so when I saw this shop, it was a must-try for me. We were first in line a few minutes before they opened at 8 but were able to place our order. They are closed to the public inside but there are 3 patio tables with chairs outside (first come, first serve). The crumpet itself is crispy on the bottom and fluffy on top. Although it looks like an English muffin, it tastes so much better! The egg, cheese, and ham combo was great with the crumpet and warmed me up on a cold, rainy morning."
,,,,,I give this place three stars for the crumpet and four stars for the ricotta cheese and lemon curd. This was my first time trying a crumpet and I have to say it's pretty good but nothing very spectacular or stood out to me. It tasted like a slightly lighter or airy English muffin and the dough was a bit chewier.The only good parts for me when it came to the crumpet  itself was the crunchy outer edges because it was toasted well. When paired with the ricotta cheese and lemon curd it was actually pretty good until it started to cool down and the crumpet got really chewey. My favorite part was the lemon curd and ricotta cheese. When paired together these two were delicious and their lemon curd was housemaid and not too sweet which I really liked. The young lady ringing us up and taking our order was very knowledgeable and nice. Honestly it was something I was curious about and wanted to try but nothing I really would seek out. If I were to ever come back I would definitely get a order of their lemon curd to take home and have it with toast. Give it a try if you've never had a crumpet before! And definitely get the ricotta cheese and lemon curd.
,,,,,So much yum! I had the crumpet with tomato and smoked salmon. It was delicious and the portion was just enough.
,,,,,"Ordered the chai and two varieties of crumpet. The chai was the unlikely highlight! Vibrant honey notes and a fresh, spicy kick that included just the right hint of cardamom and ginger. It was better than pretty much any chai I've had at cafes. "
,,,,,"Crumpets were good but felt pretty standard apart from generous slick coat of butter on top. I had the lemon curd/ricotta and smoked salmon. Felt overpriced, especially the smoked salmon which was more a salmon-blended cream cheese, bit happy to support a Pike Place establishment."

,,,,,"Delightful, unique treat while exploring Pikes Place Market. I've never had a crumpet before so wasn't sure what to expect but I am definitely a crumpet fan now. The crumpet itself was crispy on the bottom while remaining tender and pillowy in the middle. We had a lemon curd with ricotta crumpet which was not too sweet with just the right amount of tartness. We also had a Rob's favorite (green egg, tomato, English cheese, and salmon spread) - highly recommend! The egg is green from pesto - love this combination. The salmon spread was decadently creamy."
,,,,,"Mmmmm, crumpets! What the heck is a crumpet? It's like an English muffin, but more buttery and soft, almost like a biscuit. All you need to know is it's crump-a-licious!  We got an English cheese,, egg and tomato along with an egg, English cheese and ham. Both were fantastic! Not sure what differentiates ""English cheese"" from what appeared to be cheddar cheese visually, except the cheese was nice and oily and thick and yummy! "
,,,,,"Very friendly and patient service. We managed to grab one of the few tables available on the street and it was fun/interesting to watch all the people, dogs and cars go by."
,,,,,"Ingredients were clearly homemade with love, they use organic flour and the highest quality. Love that everything in this city is compostable, including the ""plastic"" silverware."
,,,,,"Prices are pretty reasonable, around six dollars or seven dollars for a loaded crumpet, and they have an incredible selection. I posted several photos of the front and our food for your re-viewing pleasure :-)"
,,,,,DELICIOUS! I highly recommend The Crumpet Shop!
,,,,,This is a COVID-era review.
,,,,,"Been on the list to try because the crumpets look delicious. Surprisingly there wasn't a line, but that's fine by me (maybe because the place was closing in 10 mins?)"
,,,,,"Tried the savory ones and they were good. Not sure what the ""imported english cheese"" was, but it looked like cheddar - just not as strong. Great balance of flavors with the pesto and tomatos."
,,,,,The order came out quickly too!
,,,,,"Unfortunately, my friend's tea order got lost so we had to wait a bit more for it. She got a free lemon scone though"
,,,,,There are like three tables at the front of the restaurant by the window to order. Great place to relax before hitting up other spots
,,,,,"there's a sign in front of the shop that says ""no worries, it's not dry"" and wow that is 100% accurate! there's a crispy bottom to support your toppings and super soft and moist inside. the toppings we got were great combos, especially the green eggs and ham - brilliant idea to mic the pesto and eggs so that your eggs don't fall off the crumpet. the smoked salmon was very smokey and a good balance with the crisp cucumber. the honey on the walnut and ricotta one was soooo good! maybe could have used a little more walnuts on top though. "
,,,,,it's a little pricey for a single crumpet but a decent size for breakfast on the run. the line looks long but ordering is very quick and they make it fast for pickup too. definitely coming back!
,,,,,"Crumpets are a griddled bread originating from the UK, and the Crumpet Shop turns out organic crumpets that are buttered and finished off with sweet or savory toppings. ""Rob's favorite"" came with a smoked salmon cream cheese, melted yellow English cheese, a green egg (flavored with pesto), and slices of tomato. This was a delectable concoction indeed, as the smokiness of the salmon, the savoriness of the cheese, the pesto flavor of the green egg, and the brightness of the tomato all came together nicely on the crumpet, which had a chewy texture and crispy griddled exterior. That being said, the prices here were definitely high for the small portions, but these made for nice snacks for eating with tea."
,,,,,"The definition of doing one thing really well. A must every time I'm in the pike place area. Love their raspberry ricotta, as well as honey walnut ricotta crumpets."
,,,,,Not sure why we haven't been here before! Tasty sweet and savory crumpets (think English muffin meets biscuit). We loved the pesto/cheese/tomato and the breakfast options with eggs were tasty as well. 
,,,,,"Lots of tea, coffee, etc options. They make these fresh but we didn't have to wait long. Make sure to get napkins and one  s plenty for most appetites because they are so buttery and rich. Get a few and share! "
,,,,,They're best fresh.
,,,,,"Loved this stop for breakfast. Indoor seating is closed for now, but there's a few tables outside. The wait wasn't too long, but would have been well worth it either way. I ordered the egg, cheese, and ham. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,This place was so lovely. The crumpets were so delicious and were very affordable. They were the perfect size and were very picturesque. They also have plenty of seating right by the entrance of Pike Place Market to enjoy these at. The staff was excellent and had great customer service. I will TOTALLY return.
,,,,,"Unfortunately, they were out of ricotta, actually, they were out of a lot of stuff, so I opted for a crumpet topped with lemon curd. The lemon curd was excellent. I think the crumpet was just a carrier for the lemon curd goodness."

,,,,,"This was my first time having crumpets and gosh they were delicious!!! These were made to perfection with that delicious crisp exterior, and topped with so much flavor like the Jalapeño egg or Ricotta and Pesto (the list is endless, so go with more people if you can to get a little tasting of all)! Took these down in minutes and have been waiting to visit Seattle again to try new flavors here. The price point is also very good like ~$7 and you get 2 PCs of crumpets."
,,,,,This was the best dessert I had in Seattle. The honey was so delicious on the crumpet. I had never had a crumpet before but now I was to go back to Seattle to get them again! There was no line and the wait was short. I wish there was a place to sit down to enjoy it
,,,,,"Yummy delicious breakfast.  The US needs more crumpets.  If you have never had one before, they are kind of like an English muffin, but without the crispy sides."
,,,,,"Perfect spot next to Pike Place entrance.  Order at the window and wait for your order inside at the back of the shop (visited in July 2021).  They have a couple tables out front, but there is plenty of seating out the side of the building at the entrance of the market."
,,,,,"We walked up on a weekday morning and there was no line to order, but there was a line for the order pick-up.  The wait wasn't terrible, especially considering the lines for all the other breakfast stops in the area."
,,,,,"My group had a bit of everything, and everyone loved their selection.  I went for the Green Eggs and Ham (Egg blended with pesto & a thick slice of ham) and the Walnut, Honey and Ricotta Cheese.  My favorite of the two was the GEH.  Anytime I am back in Seattle, I will be sure to visit just to get one of these delicious breakfast crumpets. The WHR was just OK for me.  Don't get me wrong, I ate it all up real fast, but I would not order it again."
,,,,,"I've never had a crumpet before and boy, did it blow my mind... something so ""simple."" We ended up here because the nearby brunch places had over an hour wait. While this shop did have a long line, it only lasted about 5 minutes. I ordered a crumpet that had imported English cheese, pesto, and a single slice of tomato for about $6. The crumpet itself and its texture was great - it was light and fluffy, but also very slightly toasted. It almost was like a thick pancake or an airy, soft English muffin. Perfect amount of melty cheese and pesto. Tomato was a fresh touch to it."
,,,,,"There was no seating indoor when I went (Sept 2021) and maybe about 3 tables outside, first come first serve."
,,,,,This was my first time eating a crumpet and I was pleasantly surprised. This was such good quality food. The crumpet was nice and crispy and spongy on the inside. The pesto and the cheese was excellent. The tomatoes were great quality as well. Can't wait to try more crumpets ! Thanks Guys !
,,,,,"This is shockingly good and reasonably priced for something in Pike Place Market.  I stopped by for breakfast on a rainy day, and it was worth the walk and sitting out in the cold rain.  Service was very fast and friendly.  They have a few tables outside, with the inside closed for covid.  "
,,,,,"My tomato cheese crumpet was delightfully greasy and salty, and the portion is perfect for a light breakfast.  I took some more crumpets home for the rest of the week.  "
,,,,,Warning: Do not freeze crumpets.  They will be disgusting when they thaw.   Only purchase what you can eat within a day or two.
,,,,,"I came here on a weekly basis when I lived here 6 years ago. I came back today with friends and it was just as I remember, SO GOOD!!"
,,,,,Looking for something to eat at an affordable price near Pike's market? This is definitely a place I will visit again and again.
,,,,,"Let me tell you, I was impressed how tender the crumpet was. Biting into my English cheese, pesto and tomato crumpet brought a huge sigh of happiness from my belly. "
,,,,,I was able to sample a bite of the Rob's favorite and smoked salmon with cucumber slices - both were also savory scrumptious.
,,,,,"There were a few tables in front of the shop; however, Pike's market has a little place with picnic tables across the street, so we were able to eat there."
,,,,,"I'll admit that I don't have a ton of experience with crumpets - I'm not really sure I've ever had one. I kind of expected it to be something cut in half (like an English muffin), but instead it was served like bread - with the egg and cheese (or other toppings) on top. There were a ton of topping options, many of which sounded amazing, but I was in the market for a classic breakfast and stuck with the egg and cheese. The crumpet itself was amazing - well toasted, delicious butter, and balanced well with size/topping ratio. So glad I tried this place!"
,,,,,"I asked the cashier what their most popular crumpet is, and was told that it's ""The Lifechanger"", which comes with Vermont maple butter, cream cheese, and walnuts. "
,,,,,"Too expensive for what you get IMO, since there isn't anything special about how these dishes are prepared. I think that there is too much hype about it being a crumpet, but at the end of the day, it's just a spongier version of an English muffin. They're not even as good as pancakes."
