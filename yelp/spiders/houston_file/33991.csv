Local Foods////When you walk in, there is a basket full of menus by the cashier. I got the crunchy chicken sandwich with quinoa and chips. The food came quickly and it was delicious! The ingredients used were fresh, and the bun was so good! It's perfectly crunchy of the outside, and soft on the inside. For around $12, I got a lot of food! I could only finish half of the sandwich and took the other half home.
