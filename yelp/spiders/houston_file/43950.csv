Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When you walk in you can just tell this place is well maintained and they take their craft seriously. The design layout is well executed and the display of pastries and desserts makes you want to buy something regardless if you are hungry or not. I ordered a blueberry cheesecake that was already prepared. Super creamy and packed with flavor. The inside of the cheesecake actually had pieces of blueberry within. Complementary water cups are offered near the silverware and napkins. You can also see through windows behind the display that show inside the kitchen area. Cool spot. I think they offer wifi too so you could easily study Â here.
