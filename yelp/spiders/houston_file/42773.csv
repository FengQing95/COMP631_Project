The cupcake was moist, the icing was fluffy and not too heavy, the lemon tart was absolutely refreshing, and although not usually the biggest fan, the macaroon was pretty amazing too. Â While we were sitting outside, one of the employees came out and refilled our water glasses which was a nice touch.
