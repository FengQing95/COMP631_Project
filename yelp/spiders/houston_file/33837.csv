Local Foods////Wow this place is amazing! Not only because of the food but also because of the awesome ambiance friendly staff and the size of the portions. For example I decided on a sandwich with shredded beef, bacon, and egg. That's putting it simple. But the ingredients were amazing and you could tell it was very thought out. This meal came with a soup and all of this was only $14... wow!
