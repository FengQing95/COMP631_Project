Uchi////13. Lime Ash: One of my favorite desserts of all time. If you're looking for something that balances sweetness with savoriness, then this is a must-have. The thai chili, kaffir lime, and chocolate combination make you keep reaching for the next bite because it's so well balanced and texturally inviting.
