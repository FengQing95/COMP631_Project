Baby Barnaby's////I took my grandparents to Baby Barnaby's over the weekend, and even though we got there 15 minutes after they opened, we took the last available table inside! I'be been here a few times prior and it's always crowded, but it's worth the wait for some deliciously simple breakfast food.
