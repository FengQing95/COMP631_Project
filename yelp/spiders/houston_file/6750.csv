JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After having ramen at a lot of places, I feel Jinya is just about mediocre. Although I had my first ramen here and was blown away by it, it was perhaps because I was having ramen for the first time. However, their karaage is pretty good, and it is nice to start off with it. Their panna cotta is pretty good too, although I am not a big fan of their mochi ice cream.
