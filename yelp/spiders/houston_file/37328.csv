Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the Mac and cheese for my friend's daughter. I tasted it since I'm a Mac n cheese kind of guy, but when trying it, I noticed a hint of cinnamon with it. In my opinion, it was such a bad pairing because I like my Mac n cheese exploding with flavor and it kind of threw me off! The texture was thin water cut cheese. Needless to say, the kid didn't finish it. 1/5
