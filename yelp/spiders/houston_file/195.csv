JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is 10x better than Tiger Den. The ramen ingredients taste fresh and flavorful. The service was great and the atmosphere is sophisticated in a non-stuffy way. I had the Wonton Ramen with added chicken and my fianc√© had the Tan Tan Men. We also had the gyoza and though they were small... They were delicious.
