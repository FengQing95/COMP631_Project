The Pit Room////My husband and I are not from the area, so we always try to seek out delicious eats when we go to different cities. This place is the place to get BBQ in Houston. The employees are so friendly and make sure that you are comfortable and have everything you need to enjoy your meal. The portion sizes are great and the price is right. Got stuffed on a one meat dinner (brisket, mustard potato salad and slaw). The sauce is to die for. The meat is so tender and smoked to perfection. Seating was nice for the time we went. We went at 4pm on a Thursday (walked 30 minutes to enjoy the food and it was well worth it). I imagine on nights and weekends that it could get a little crowded. I will recommend this local joint to anyone around Houston and we will be back next time we are in town!
