Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Such a beautiful venue! I love coming here when I'm in Montrose! I love pretty much everything they have! I wish they would keep more pistachio croissants in stock because I have come to their shop on several occasions and be heartbroken that they've run out :(
