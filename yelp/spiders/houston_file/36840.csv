Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for brunch for a friends birthday. The atmosphere was great, windows and doors were all open and it felt wonderful. I ordered the Bosscat Burger (the chef's way) and it was seriously delicious. All the food I tried from the others was just as good! Our servers Terry and Brie also helped make the visit so enjoyable- they were lively, helpful and had a great sense of humor. Definitely check this place out!
