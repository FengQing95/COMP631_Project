I usually get the crunchy chicken sandwich as a salad. I love this option to turn any sandwich into a salad. This one has the crispy coated chicken thinly sliced atop a beautifully dressed bed of greens. They use house made pickles that offer the perfect tanginess and zing. There's also house made chips instead of boring croutons that add a perfect amount of crunch and texture. It's a party in my mouth...and it's hard to say that about a salad! You gotta go try it
