JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Heard a lot of good reviews (word of mouth) about Jinya. It did not disappoint. Some friends and I went last night, first time for all of us. The reviews are in. Winner. Great food, location and atmosphere. Service was good/fast. The music was slightly too loud inside, but I get it - that's the vibe. I had the brussle sprouts tempura and pot stickers as appetizers and the Chicken Ghasu Bowl. I recommend!
