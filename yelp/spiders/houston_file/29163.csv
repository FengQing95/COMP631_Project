The Pit Room////I order the end cut so it is full of spices. Their Wagu beef rib is expensive but worth it if they give you a large rib. I've had it 3x and the last time it was much smaller than usual. I'm still addicted to Salt Lick BBQ sauce & their double cut beef ribs, but since I live in Htown, the Pit Room is my favorite local BBQ.
