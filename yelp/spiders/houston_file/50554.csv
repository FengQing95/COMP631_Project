Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is kind of hit or miss in both service and the drinks. I have had better luck with the cafe drinks than the mixed drinks. I wanted to like the Benedict but the english muffin was not toasted and made the meal seem bland, soft and dry. The pancakes are a safe bet.
