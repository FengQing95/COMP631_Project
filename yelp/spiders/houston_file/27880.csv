The Pit Room////Con: lots of flies in the dining area.  The slaw didn't seem that fresh and the rub was very salty for me. Obviously this is just a personal preference so I know by the other reviewers that this is quite good for them.  Ribs were good, brisket was a little dry.  Maybe I went on a bad day.
