Uchi////My wife and I love sushi! We were in town from Vegas, where we get to eat arguably some of the best sushi in America. Uchi was top notch and their multi-course meal was one of the best dinners we've had. If you go as a couple, sit at the bar with the lovely miss Pam. She was awesome (i think we annoyed the s*\~ out of her), and make sure you have the brussel sprouts. Yes! Brussel sprouts at a sushi place, they were so good we bought their cookbook. (Spoiler) no sprout recipe, good book though. We will be back.
