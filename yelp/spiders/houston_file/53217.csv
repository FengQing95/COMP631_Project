Kata Robata////3/5 for the ramen. The noodles were the star for sure, but that makes for an average bowl of food. The soft-boiled egg lacked flavor and overcooked. The broth was nothing special but clung to the noodles well to give the noodles the edge. For $14, a bowl of ramen better be better than what I can get for less than 10.
