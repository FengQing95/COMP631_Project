Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I can't say enough good things about Snooze!  I thought the pineapple upside down pancake was to die for until I tasted the pumpkin spice cream cheese pancake! After my jog at Buffalo Bayou Park on the first cool day in Houston that pumpkin  pancake and hashbrowns gave me life!!
