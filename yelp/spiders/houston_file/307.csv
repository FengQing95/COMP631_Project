JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen noodles soup bowl I had was great. The broth was chicken base. It was very flavourful. The ramen was just the right doneness and texture. You could have added numerous sides to the dish like broccoli, extra chicken, wanton etc. I opted for no additions. The size of the bowl was good and of course I ate all of it. They have different levels of spiciness. I ordered mild. For me I needed it to be spicier but the condiments made up. Will definitely try it again. Also, there is a free parking garage at the back of building which, made it even more lucrative for me to frequent there. I gave it four because it was my first visit and I need to try other stuff. By the way the fried brussels sprout in tempura batter was good too.
