Kata Robata////I would have given them 5 stars but we've had some issues and no restaurant is perfect, so I have let it slide a couple of times. Every issue that I have there have been resolved and the manager was very accommodating. My motto is, People are not mind readers, so if you have an issue, speak up now or forever hold your peace.
