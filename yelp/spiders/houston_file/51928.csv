Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After waiting in line for eternity and leaving several times, I finally made the cut at the much ballyhooed Snooze in Montrose. Got 3 over easy, bacon and hash browns with toast. Bacon was limp and greasy. The rest was OK, but that's it, OK. Service was good, but I wouldn't recommend waiting in a line or paying extra for the right to say you had breakfast at Snooze. The food at Avalon and House of Pies is better and cheaper. Unless you like to be seen eating breakfast, I'd recommend other sensible venues.
