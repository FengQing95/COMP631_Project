Uchi////This place is incredible. My boyfriend took me here for dinner on my birthday a couple of weeks ago and neither of us had ever been here before. We were a bit confused by the menu items and the waitress patiently went into detail explaining everything to us. I wish I could remember her name, she was the sweetest person and her service was great. We decided on the zero sen roll and the brussel sprouts to start off with. I was about to order another roll when our waitress told us that they would be sending over some small dishes to our table. Soon another waitress (manager?) arrived with the Hamachi Nabe. It was SO GOOD, as were the zero sen roll and the brussel sprouts. Soon after they brought us each another small plate. It was some sort of sashimi on top of a wonton chip with apple and nuts. It was incredible as well, and very refreshing. I couldn't believe how they went above and beyond to take care of us (even discounted the bill!), whether it was because it was my birthday or some other reason. The only thing to note is that the service is not particularly speedy, but I definitely don't see that as a con for a restaurant like Uchi. We were able to relax and enjoy the atmosphere and the food without feeling rushed whatsoever. I will forever recommend Uchi to everyone I know and I can't wait to come back!
