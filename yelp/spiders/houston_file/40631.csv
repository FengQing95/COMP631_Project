Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here, as we were visiting from Atlanta. From start to finish, everyone was friendly and service was immaculate. We had the gulf shrimp & grits and corn crusted catfish with the mushroom risotto. Both dishes were amazing, it was a lot of food so they boxed it up for us to go. Update: it almost tasted better the next day!
