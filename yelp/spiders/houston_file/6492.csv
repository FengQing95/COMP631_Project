JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Long story short: you can find pretty good ramen here. Jinya is a hip, swanky little restaurant that usually has a long wait, but it's worth it. I've only ever ordered the ramen here. The tonkotsu spicy is a solid choice (I usually get it extra hot), and I think it fares better than other ramen places like Tiger Den. I've also ordered the Cha Cha Cha (garlic ramen), and in that case, I preferred Tiger Den's version. Service has been pretty good every time I've gone there.
