JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Houston's food scene has been missing good ramen and Jinya has finally filled that void.  We had a great experience from start to finish (thank you Anna for the excellent service).  The food was really comparable to our favorite ramen place in NYC, Ippudo.  We will definitely be back! Can recommend the tonkotsu black, both spicy and hot, the jinya buns, and the gyoza.
