Kata Robata////Definitely make a reservation. We made the mistake of not doing so, but easily killed time at the bar as we waited. The ambiance is great for a date or a nice dinner, and the food was some of the best I've ever had. The Texas Kobe Beef skewers were super flavorful and will melt right in your mouth. If you are a dumpling fanatic like me, don't miss out on the wagyu and shrimp shumai!!! The portions are very small, so I would Â recommend getting at-least two dishes per person if you can!
