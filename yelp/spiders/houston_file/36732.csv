Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambience this great. Great music, really cool atmosphere and the good was amazing! One of the best burgers I've ever had. Our waiter Terry was really cool, personable, and down to earth. You can tell he really loves what he does. I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be back!
