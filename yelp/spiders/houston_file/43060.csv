Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This placed used to have amazing croissants that were crisp and flaky with tons of layers when it first opened. Quality control sure has lapsed. The last 3 times Ive had croissants have been limp and soggy and this was first thing Saturday morning. Maybe they are better on the week days.
