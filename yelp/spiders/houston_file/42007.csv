Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Worst customer service ever!! Called in advance for an order I made a week in advance and called the night before to make sure they had my order and the time I will be picking it up. When I arrived not only did they not have my order ready they lost the entire order and did not have it ready. I had to wait an hour and a half to wait for the cookies to bake and was not offered anything for the trouble. I would never recommend anyone order anything from their bakery as they are very unprofessional!!!
