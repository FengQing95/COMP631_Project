Kata Robata////The only time I find myself yelping is when there is something I love a lot or I hate extremely! I have been coming here for years but whatever it was tonight. The vibe and service was horrible! The waiter brought everything out late. It took about 30 mins to situate the check. When you go and tell the manager that the service was bad he comes back and asks what time did you get here? Excuse me, does it matter what time I got to a restaurant?? I work in the service industry and if I have a client that it not happy I make changes and I make them happy and apologize. We received the most driest, nonchalant apology. Really upset, you come and enjoy a nice dinner with friends and then bc of the people that are supposed to make sure you have a good experience - it sucked! Won't be back for a while.
