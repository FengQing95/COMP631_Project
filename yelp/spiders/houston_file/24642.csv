Uchi////On a visit to Houston for work, the hotel front desk recommended Uchi as I was in the mood for sushi. I had no idea what I was getting into. I was seated at the sushi bar, and everyone was so kind. It was a team effort taking care of me and I'd have to say it was one of the most amazing sushi experiences I've had. The chef took care of everything. While not cheap ($170 or so for just me), it was absolutely worth it and I want to go again on my next trip to Houston. Yes, I'm drooling just remembering back to this experience several years ago!
