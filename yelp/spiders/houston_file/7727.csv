JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time diner here.  I really liked the atmosphere.  The service was cheerful and attentive.  A fairly large selection of different styles of Ramen, plus plenty of other dishes for those inclined for rice bowls, soft buns, or small plates.  The gyoza (potstickers) were particularly good, and I liked that an order was 8 two-bite dumplings, rather than several large ones (better for those of us with a limited chopstick proficiency).  The spicy miso ramen was so good, probably one of the best I've had in town, and a formidable competitor to what I get on my regular trips to Tokyo.
