Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After having a not so great experience that I had posted on yelp, I was contacted by Becky. Whe went back and forth about my experience and Snooze kindly sent me a gift card to apologize and give them another opportunity. We went there today for a late breakfast and of course had to wait. We had given our phone # and watched while other people after us were seated. My husband apparently did not feel the vibration on his phone. So he complained and found the text after we were seated. We did have a nice tasty enjoyable meal. We both had omelettes, mine with wild mushrooms, Swiss cheese and hollandise sauce on the side. My husband's with peppers, bacon and cheddar cheese. They both came with the round hash browns and I had tortillas and my husband had toast with some jam they put on the side. Our server was very nice and friendly and we asked about a serving of the sweet potato pancakes that my husband loves and she recommended to get one which was plenty. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding this time. It's a bit of a splurge for us but we definitely enjoyed it so much better. The gift card covered the meal since my husband had coffee and I had water. Thanks again Becky for the generous gift card. We tipped our server well and we had a great meal. By the way our server's name I think was Candice.
