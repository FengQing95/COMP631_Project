Kata Robata////If you are looking for traditional Japanese food, this place has it all! The atmosphere can get quite noisy to the point where you have to pretty much yell at company to carry on a convo, but the food was Good! We did sit towards the back in the corner which made handling the noise a little better. We like sushi a lot, not a lot of sushi options but nonetheless still amazing. Parking is kinda hard to find if the shopping center the restaurant sits in is packed. They have valet, but few spots available. We noticed a lot of high-end, expensive cars parked in valet and people walking into this restaurant.
