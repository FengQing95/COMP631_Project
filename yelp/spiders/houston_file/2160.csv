JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I thought the food was ok the appetizer was good . Nothing interesting about the place I had the dry noodles and it was ok the noodles are good with the seasoning but I think it was the flavor and vegetables that didn't make it interesting like I could make better dry noodles at home but next time I go there I'm going to give the place another chance and they something else. On the bright side truffle brussels sprouts was amazing full of flavor and the soy sauce and the other sauces amazing with the brussel sprouts.
