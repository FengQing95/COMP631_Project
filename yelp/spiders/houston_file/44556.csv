Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only thing I can complain about it that it is hard to find a table and when you do it is meant for 2 but you have to make it work for 4.  There is a lot of bar type seating but nobody was using it and I imagine if people were it would feel even more cramped in there. Also we spent dinner money on brunch.  4 entrees, 2 pastries, 4 coffee drinks for more than $100.
