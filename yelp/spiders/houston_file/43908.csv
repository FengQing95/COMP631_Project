Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond manages to be constantly 75%+ occupied throughout the duration of my both my visits here, which just shows you how much Houston loves this place! My friend said they're most busy while the baked goods are still in stock (more on that later). They have a seasonal brunch/lunch menu, giving their food a very fresh and sustainable feel to it. Each time I've been here, the entrees were delicious, not too heavy, and portion size is perfect! Baked goods are made daily and are gorgeously displayed for guests to see. I usually don't like American sweets because they're too sweet (I prefer Asian sweets), but the baked sweets from Common Bond are a happy medium, just enough sweet, not too much. I came in at 10am, and by 12noon, half the baked goods were gone! No more kouign amann (pronounced like "queen ah-mon") for the rest of the day! There is also a side coffee/tea bar, where they're rushing out steaming hot drinks (and cold ones too, I'm sure). Latte's always have fun latte art, which is a nice touch.
