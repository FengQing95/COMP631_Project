JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Absolutely delicious! The noodles weren't overcooked, the broth was the right color and consistency and so flavorful with the garlic! The pork was tender. It was amazing. I looooooooved it! I crave it all the time and wish I lived closer to it, then I would probably eat it 5 or 6 times a week. The first pork ramen on the menu is my favorite.
