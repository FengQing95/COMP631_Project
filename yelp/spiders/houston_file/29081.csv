The Pit Room////My favorite thing about this place was the unlimited pickled vegetables bar! Every time you go somewhere that gives you pickled vegetables, they always give you maybe 3 pieces max, but this place lets you laod up cardboard boats full of them! Carrots, onions, cucumber, jalape√±os, etc.-- as much as you want/ need to balance out that heavy barbecue.
