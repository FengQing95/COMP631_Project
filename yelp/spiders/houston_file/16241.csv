JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the ramen, our go-to option is the JINYA tonkotsu black. Very flavorful and delicious, and the noodles are cooked to perfection! I always want to try some of the other options, but this one is just so tasty that I inevitably end up coming back to it. Only complaint is that the ramen is a bit oily. After you're done eating, if you still have soup left, you can see the layer of oil forming at the top. Not as bad as some other places, but I would prefer if they used maybe just half the amount of oil.
