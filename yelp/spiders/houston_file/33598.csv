Local Foods////I'm vegetarian so I've never gotten their Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, but as you can suspect from the rest of the Yelp reviews - this sandwich is probably their most fantastic. I'm not a fan of their Falafel sandwich, because mine was a little too salty, but the Egg Salad is perfect and so much more flavorful than any Egg Salad sandwich I've ever had (they're usually pretty bland...). They use real crab in their Crab sandwich, which is also a plus. The decor is incredibly refreshing, and it's an amazing atmosphere to have a great meal with friends.
