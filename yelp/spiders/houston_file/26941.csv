The Pit Room////Cool place! After reading the reviews I was hesitant that the brisket, my favourite dish, would be dry. I found it was quite tasty and the spicy bbq sauce on the side added a good twist to it. I thought the brisket sandwich was reasonably priced but the sides were ridiculously expensive! The portions of the sides were incredibly small for what I paid. Would explore other bbq places in houston, but it wasn't bad!
