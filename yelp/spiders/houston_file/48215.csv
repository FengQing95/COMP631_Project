Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were here around 10am on Labor Day. There was an hour wait but since they will text and give you 5 minutes to appear, we had plenty of time to go to Walgreens nearby. It was so worth the wait! I have celiac and the waitress assured me they would make sure my breakfast was modified to be gluten free and safe. It was delicious!
