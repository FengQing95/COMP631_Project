Baby Barnaby's////Pancake: I don't remember which flavor we got, but I think that the pancakes here are too dry and crumbly. I like my pancakes with a little more moisture and slightly denser, but the pancakes here falls apart and because of that, I think the flavor isn't as strong either. You definitely need to slather on the maple syrup.
