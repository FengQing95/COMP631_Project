JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place! I had the Tonkotsu Black Ramen and it was so delicious. The pork was so tender and the seasoned soft boiled egg is so flavorful, it makes the dish. The food was top notch, but the service and management was even better. They went above and beyond to make my meal perfect. I will definitely be back!
