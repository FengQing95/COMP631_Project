Kata Robata////The red snapper and topped with Asian sauce and truffle is just superb. Although truffle looked to be hard and crunchy, surprisingly, you could barely tell it was there except for the heavenly taste when on top of the fish, rolled around in the sauce, and in your mouth for a taste that spreads in your mouth wanting more. -- green are suggested for that nice crunch again.
