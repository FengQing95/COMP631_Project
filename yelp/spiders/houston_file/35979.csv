Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is such a fun place for young houstonians! If you go, you MUST REQUEST TERRY as your waiter! We had a big group and he was SO nice and very accommodating. Terry was also super funny and very knowledgeable about the menu - best waiter I've had in a while!!! Definitely recommend for a nice dinner or date night.
