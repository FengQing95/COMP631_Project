JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They offer different broths, chicken , pork, and vege. They also have pretty good appetizers and sukiyaki bowl options if you are not a huge fan of ramen. They have pretty good tonkatsu ramen if you are first time visitor at this restaurant. Brussel sprouts tempura, and takoyaki are their best selling appetizer items. Id give 4/5 for both. Last time I visited, I also tried crispy chicken, and it was really salty. Didn't bring it up thinking it is how its been made, but i saw alot of people complaining about this as well.
