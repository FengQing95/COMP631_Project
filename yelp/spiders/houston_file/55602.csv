Kata Robata////Kata Robata is located in a little shopping area in Houston. Parking is quite tight and it could be hard to get a spot on a really busy night. On the night I went, there were a few spots reserved for valet parking. If parking is too much of a hassle on the night that you chose to eat here, valet is an option.
