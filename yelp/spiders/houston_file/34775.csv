Local Foods////I ordered the Crunchy Chicken sandwich and it was delicious but can we talk about the two sides, one was the broccoli quinoa salad ... OMG that was the best thing I have eaten in a long time.  The second side were the pickles. I was thinking just a normal dill pickle... oh no these were the best pickles too.  Wow. You guys know how to do it!!!!
