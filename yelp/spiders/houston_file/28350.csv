The Pit Room////The Brisket is smoked for a minimum of ten hours after it sits in a fridge for three or more days in a salt and pepper dry rub. I like the moist kind with the molten fat and this really blew my mind. Dug the crust vs. bark, which seems to be getting out of hand these days among BBQ spots, kind of like today's brewers and the battle for most bitter IPA....
