Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been interested in trying out Common Bond for some time now, and decided to use it as my reading destination this Sunday morning. Â I've had high expectations for Common Bond based on the rave reviews I've encountered here on Yelp and through word-of-mouth, and am happy to report that it did not disappoint.
