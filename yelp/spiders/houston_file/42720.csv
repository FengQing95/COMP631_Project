Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They have a private parking lot but since they are getting so much well deserved love, the place can be crazy.  You're better off looking for street parking, be careful of the signs, some areas are permit parking only.  On this particular visit we kind of parked in an area where we needed to get back to our cars asap, so we took our order to-go.  But the dining space is beautiful.  Very modern and busy.
