Kata Robata////I enjoyed the various rolls I ordered (particularly enjoyed the salmon and soft shell crab roll, but I've had better, sashimi was solid), but really disliked Kata Robata's twist on seaweed salad. It's very different from the run-of-the-mill seaweed salad, but in my opinion, for the worse. It felt very "stringy." While some of the entree items intrigued me (i.e. hot rocks), I would rather go to Uchi for the same item for the same price, but guaranteed higher quality.
