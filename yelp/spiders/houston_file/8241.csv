JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place including Ramen Tatsuya, Tiger Den, and Ramen Bar Ichi are my favorite places ya diggg. Ramen is a bit expensive compared to the other places but it's worth. The weekends from Friday-Sun are pretty busy but yea. The soup, noodles, and meat all go well together so my friends and I were satisfied with that.
