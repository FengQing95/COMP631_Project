Kata Robata////One of the best things about eating with a group is the chance to try more dishes than if you go alone. As a small plates kind of place, it's even more true here at Kata. For 6 people, we ordered 11 dishes and 4 desserts. Highlights: eggplant special with grilled rice, shumai with spicy oil in medicine droppers (interesting!), Kobe beef skewers (I think they were sous vide - super tender), karaage pork belly (great combo of pork and cheese and figs). Their rolls were good, but being from NYC, not "out of this world" good except for the rising sun roll which has truffle oil. Mixed reviews from my group on this roll since it's so inauthentic. But I liked it because it was unusual but delicious in a very rich unctuous way. Desserts were good but probably the most memorable one was the banana creme brulee - deliciously creamy with a nice touch of the fruit freshness. We sat in the rear expansion space which was perfect since it got us out of the main (but noisy) dining area. And the service was friendly. The food came out pretty quickly. Great place for dates our coming with friends.
