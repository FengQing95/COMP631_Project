Uchi////We take full responsibility for not stopping this sooner -- that's on us and we'll live with the consequences -- but our bill for four people was over $1,000 for four people and there's no way Matt didn't know exactly what he was doing -- hosing us. It's a shame, because instead of recommending this place for the food, we left with a bad taste in our mouth. Shady!
