Baby Barnaby's////It's a small restaurant, with some seating inside and outside. Throughout the week their usually is not much of a wait, but on the weekends.....forget about it! Crazy packed! The servers move very fast though and the food does not take long either, so if you can afford the wait of about 40 min or so....I say it is worth it
