JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I took my 2 kids (14 and 19) to dinner just to try something new and something away from our normal eating area and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food, waiter was really good and recognizing new to place spent a hood amount of time walking thru the menu.  He even tried to teach my son how to use chopsticks.  Highly recommend.
