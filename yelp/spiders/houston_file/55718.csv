Kata Robata////We waited for a table for about 30 minutes- and I am glad we did! The service was very detailed, top notch and quiet. Where they swoop in always make sure your water, soda and wine if full. It was for a business meeting and we got mainly sushi and a few other items like the lobster Mac and cheese. The sushi was so smooth and tasty! I also love the sushi rolls weren't filled with a bunch of stuff- it was straight forward. Â My only negative is it is VERY loud. All in all wonderful and highly recommend. Will be back!
