Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////3 stars on yelp = a-ok. That's exactly what it was: a=ok. I went after a night shift so arrived exactly at 6:30am with no wait. The ambiance is cute, it reminds me of a retro diner. The food was really not worth the hype. I ordered the pancake flight including their famous blueberry pancake and found that although it was creative and overall solidly made, everything was way too sweet. The pancakes were fluffy and not too drenched in toppings, but it felt like I was eating a dessert platter.
