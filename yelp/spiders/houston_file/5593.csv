JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I give it a 4 stars for ambiance, service and tasty ramen. Many suggested the spicy chicken ramen is better than the tonkatsu ramen, but I begged to differ. For our dinner, while the spicy chicken had great flavor, the spicy taste dominated the ramen and the chicken tasted just okay. The sliced pork in tonkatsu was tender and the broth was pretty balanced with the seaweed and black mushroom. I heard the lady next do me complaining it was very salty, but couldn't agree since a good broth is always going to have a tastier and saltier flavor. The tempura fried Brussel sprouts with a hint of truffle oil was a great starter. Overall, I liked Jinya over Samurai and plan to come back to try their other menu items.
