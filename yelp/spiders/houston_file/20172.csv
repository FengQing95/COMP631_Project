Uchi////Came here for happy hour on a weeknight and I'm going to venture and say this is the best sushi in Houston, hands down.  As far as presentation and creativity, Uchi cannot be beat.  The price is a killer, ended up spending $100 for two people but you get what you pay for.  It's nice to go once for the experience, but for my money, I'd probably rather go to Kata Robata on a regular rotation.
