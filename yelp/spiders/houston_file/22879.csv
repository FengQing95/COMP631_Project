Uchi////I went there with a small group of friends to celebrate my friend's birthday, and they sat us at a table in the smaller room toward the back. I've been to Uchi a few times prior, and usually for special occasions. I normally had great experience every time, except today. We were asked repeatedly why we went to dine there, and yet they didn't make it anymore special then a usual dinner and any other restaurant. We were there for a good 3 hours, but we only saw our server for less than 10 times. We had to keep asking other people who drooped of our food for things, and also they kept dropping items that we didn't order. His attitude was not great, toward the end we asked him if he can rushed the last 2 orders of the nigiri out, his answer was simply no. I understand their concept of phasing out food but after 3 hours I think it's ok, plus he knew we ordered desserts as well. Not once when he was taking care of us he wishes my friend a Happy Birthday, I know he didn't have to but what was the point of them asking us then? For the price we paid, I expected a better experience than what we had. If we ever go back we'll definitely won't sit with the same server again.
