Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First start, valet is not free and costs $20 to park if there are no free spaces to park your own self. Upon entering, most of the waiting staff and hosts were friendly, but one male server was completely 'cocky doodle doo'. He didn't acknowledge us when we were trying to ask for assistance (seated inside facing the outdoor entrance). I know this is a 'whiskey lounge' but customer service goes a long way for the tips as well as new business recognition. Our female server was not up to par on representing the libations section. Unfortunately, I just stuck with what I knew, vodka+water.
