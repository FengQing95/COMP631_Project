Local Foods////I tried their crunchy chicken sandwich. It is one of the most deliberated sandwich I've ever had. It is so unique that you wouldn't get it anywhere else. I like the idea of using pretzel buns and potato chips instead of deep-frying chicken to make it crunchy. As my sides, I got kale and coleslaw. The kale was as good as everyone writes about. The coleslaw was interesting that it has got some seaweed and oriental flavor. Very creative but it is working quite well. I also like that everything contains many different ingredients in it.
