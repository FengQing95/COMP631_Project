JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food they serve at Jinya is phenomenal.  The broth for their tonkatsu is cooked to perfection and you can tell that it requires overnight prep.  The eggs are still runny on inside which is an awesome boost to the flavor.  The Tonkatsu itself melts in your mouth.  And the ramen noodles leave you begging for more.  My favorite is the Jinya Black; it has roasted garlic and wonderful flavor.  Make sure to order it Hot!
