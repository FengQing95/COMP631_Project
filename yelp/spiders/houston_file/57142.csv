Kata Robata////I ordered 4 different appetizers, omakase, and like 4 other a la carte items plus drinks. We finished our sashimis and omakase before we realized we hadn't even received our apps yet. My friend started to ask the waitress about it and she just cut her off saying "I know I know...I was just waiting for you to finish your sashimi." I'm shocked.
