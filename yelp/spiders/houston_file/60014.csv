Baby Barnaby's////Tried the green eggs dish. A play on green eggs and ham - this is eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke, and cheese, served with crispy cubed potatoes, and a chicken apple sausage. This dish is really really good! Beware - the eggs are cooked quite runny which not everyone enjoys but I really liked it cooked this way. Nice and creamy. Â The chicken sausage was average. Mild seasoning on it. The potatoes are fried very crispy and aggressively seasoned. The potatoes are excellent and they give you a lot.
