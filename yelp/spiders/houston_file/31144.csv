Local Foods////Love! Love! Love! Have been here more than 10 times and am never disappointed. The kale side dish is crave worthy. I wake up nights longing for the egg salad. Delicious, great value, wonderful staff. The very best of this style place in the area. This is quality casual dining, and the execution is flawless or they make it right. Cannot recommend highly enough.
