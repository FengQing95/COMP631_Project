JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Around 8ish, yes late for me to eat but my friend insisted I try. So a wait was saying many love this place. So the bar seating was available and we opted for that. The chicken ramen came and omg it was gone! It was like u became a magician, poof disappear. I was not even hungry, really? But so tasty gosh I will be back!
