Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The negatives: disorganized service with servers running around like whirling dervishes trying to navigate the closely-spaced tables; seemingly random delivery of your purchases in no reasonable order; and food that is unbelievably and gratuitously overpriced. Some of the pastries are a reasonable value (scones, cookies), but others are frankly ridiculous.
