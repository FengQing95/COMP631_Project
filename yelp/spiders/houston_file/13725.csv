JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is always a favorite go to in the midtown area! they're obviously incredibly popular but i do think their vegan ramen is super underrated. i'm vegetarian so i'll add a seasoned egg and it's amazing. hands down the best ramen i've ever had. also, they call it spicy ramen but it's only a hint of spicy (which I say as someone with a relatively low spice tolerance)
