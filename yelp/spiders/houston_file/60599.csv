Baby Barnaby's////I am not a patient person when my stomach is rumbling but I would wait for Barnaby's. Ray M. and I headed out from Dallas at 4:30 AM and were STARVING by the time we got to Houston. Our first stop was Barnaby's. Be prepared to wait if you come during the breakfast hours on the weekends because this is a very popular spot.
