JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I met a friend here for lunch on a Wednesday around 1 p.m. and almost every seat was taken. For a small restaurant the line was backed up to the front door and it took about 15 minutes to place an order. I was really unsure of what I wanted but the cashier was very helpful in explaining what was in each dish.
