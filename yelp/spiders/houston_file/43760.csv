Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond gets its kudos not for the food alone, but for the overall experience.  You walk in to a very sleek, modern building, with decor consisting of old-fashioned white milk jugs and a tasteful pastel colors.  The natural light flooding in from the walls and skylights provides a more welcoming vibe than most cafes.  You immediately feel like you're in an establishment that's equal parts trendy, but with the quaint charm of a neighborhood bakery.
