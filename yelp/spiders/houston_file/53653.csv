Kata Robata////We've been coming here since it opened and have usually enjoyed it (Uchi is now our fave of course). The problem with Kata though has always been the service. It's a hit or miss. We don't mind trying stuff that doesn't totally meet our expectations as long as there's some really good stuff to balance it out. However, don't give us okay food and terrible service. We went last night for my sis's bday. I wanted something other than sushi so thought this would be an excellent opportunity to try stuff from the Robata. The spicy soy ramen was good and I'd try it again--I expected more spice. My bf got the amberjack with foie gras which he thought was alright. He wasn't jumping up and down about it. My sister got several pieces of sushi and they were fresh as always. The bone marrow is ALWAYS excellent and I highly recommend it (and it's not a meal, in response to an earlier review--this restaurant has a tapas-style sharing thing going on so if you expect each dish to be a meal, of course you'll go hungry!)
