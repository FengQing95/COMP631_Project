Baby Barnaby's////Atmosphere: The place gives a hipster vibe with random pictures on the wall. It was a small place with indoor seating and a nice patio area. We came on a Sunday morning with a group of 6 and we still had to wait for a few minutes. There is not much room for big groups as our group of 6 had to be split up. If we came at the right time, we probably could have all been seated together. They have a TV playing PBS (this was a Sunday morning). They also have a visible orange juicer on the counter. The crowd was a mix of everyone so you won't feel out of place!
