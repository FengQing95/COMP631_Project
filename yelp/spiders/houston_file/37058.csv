Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Overall:  food excellent, drinks good, service average, chairs bad.  I almost gave it a 4 but in a town where there is great food everywhere service and comfort is a differentiator and I didn't find it here.  I'll come back to eat and drink but with lower expectations.  If they changed out the chairs and worked on the service side this place would be a staple for me.
