Uchi////Happy hour. Amazing. It was so refreshing to see staff members working together as a TEAM and functioning like one big well-oiled machine. Honestly, it was nice to see that everyone's role helped to make the customers experience worthwhile. I was so impressed by this. If I were the owners I would be proud. I wish that more restaurants and hotels had this quality of customer care and service (A+++).
