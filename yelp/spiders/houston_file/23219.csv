Uchi////Customer service experience is THE GOLD standard. I have never experienced such good customer service. Â No one is perfect but its how you handle situations like this is what separates you from a good place and an exemplary place. We had a misplaced item in our food, we showed it to our chef as we sat at the bar and IMMEDIATELY the head sushi chef, followed by the manager, followed by the server came to address our concerns, got us new food, and comped several of our items. Yoshio, the head sushi chef, gave us his card and encouraged us to write a review as he said it reminds us (them) to continually improve.
