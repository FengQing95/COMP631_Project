Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food: Very disappointing. I ordered an assortment of things to take home - scone, country loaf, chocolate chip cookie, chocolate croissant,, tart. Shockingly disappointed in every single thing. Seriously? Out of a box of gorgeous looking breads, pastries and treats I couldn't find a thing that was excellent. Wow - wasn't expecting that. I love crusty breads, tarts, but none of these even remotely wowed me -except they were beautiful to look at. The bread loaf was so blah boring that I immediately threw most of it in the freezer - knowing I would never eat it but couldn't bring myself to throw it out. It was mostly tasteless.
