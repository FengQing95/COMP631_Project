Local Foods////We ordered at the counter. I opted for the Bahn Mi(great flavors) with a side of DELICIOUS kale and an unique potato salad. My friends got the Crunchy Chicken sandwich (huge and scrumptious) and the Duck Confit sandwich (daily special) with Lemongrass Soup (daily special) that she couldn't stop eating!
