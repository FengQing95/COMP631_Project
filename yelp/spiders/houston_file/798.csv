JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been here many times now. I have tried different options each time and not once was I disappointed. So far this is my favorite place in Houston to get ramen. Anything spicy is really good! If you want spicy get the double inferno. However, it is very spicy and takes away from the broth. You have been warned! Other than the food itself, the ramen is really great, the service is always friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is pretty nice.
