JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not too happy about the 45 min wait but luckily there was a dessert place nearby so we walked over there to ease our hunger. They have a pretty big selection of ramen and we were very surprised at how big the portions were! The bowls are typically an illusion at ramen places but this one was truly big with lots of noodles in there as well. We got the spicy tonkotsu and the tonkotsu black. Both of it was very flavorful, came with a whole soft boiled egg and a decent piece of chashu. The broths were delicious but not too thick or heavy. I enjoyed the tonkotsu black broth more as it feels like there was more packed into it. The egg was good buuut it wasn't marinated so it didn't have much flavor. The chashu was delicious, it was tender and tasted great! This is definitely the best place we've been to around texas. I would compare this to how Ramen Tatsuya in Austin - used to be. I'd definitely wanna come back here the next time I visit, and perhaps try their appetizers as well!
