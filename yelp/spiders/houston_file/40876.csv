Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I don't know why it took us so long to come here! Rich flavors, cool vibe, and great service. Their cocktails are flavorful but not too sweet and they actually have a decent selection of wine for a whiskey bar! All the appetizers looked good so it was hard to choose but I can recommend the pig candy. Do yourself a favor and get the bosscat burger chef's way. Our waiter recommended the sweet chili sauce on the side of the catfish and I would agree. He was also super honest about the desserts and wouldn't let us order the ones that were overrated. Honesty goes a long way for me and he made our experience memorable.
