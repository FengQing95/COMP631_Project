Kata Robata////While in Houston, I wanted to try the best Japanese restaurants (owned/operated by Japanese) that the city had to offer. Kata came up on my search and so I tried it out. I came on a Sunday night as a walk in. They were busy, but were able to seat me at the sushi counter in about 10 minutes.
