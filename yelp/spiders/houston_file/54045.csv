Kata Robata////This place is truly amazing, extremely polite staff and extremely fresh food. The restaurant is always very clean and well kept. I've eaten Sushi all over the world and this is still my favorite. Some could say that my palate is used to Kata but this isn't the case. May I suggest the Rising Sun roll "warning this roll may be addictive lol", Lobster Mac & Cheese, great Toro and also the Houston roll is the best I've had. Everything I've tried has been great!!! You can't go wrong with any selection.. When you go ask for SHAUN, he is a great waiter and extremely knowledgeable about every item on the menu..
