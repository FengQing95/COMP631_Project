Local Foods////Was in the Village on a rare visit and decided I could finally try out Local Foods. Heard the things to try were the crunchy chicken sandwich, kale salad, and homemade chips. So that's what I got. Luckily I got there early and only had a couple people ahead of me. The space is so nice and airy, a mix of industrial and home-y. Clientele was extremely diverse and started piling in. While I waited for my food the line started to stretch out the door. My food arrived and was looking fresh and tasty. The chicken was juicy and the 'crunchy' part seemed to be provided by chips in the sandwich (though the menu says nut-crusted... I'll have to take a better look next time!). The kale salad was well dressed and the sweetness of the raisins and sharp parmesan helped balance the bitterness. The chips may be my favorite part. Perfect thickness and that crispy fresh potato flavor that you just can't get out of a bag. Definitely want to try more things on the menu!
