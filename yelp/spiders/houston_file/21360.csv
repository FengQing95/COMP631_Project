Uchi////I had Girl's Night Out here at Uchi with one of my girlfriend. I was pretty shocked that she wanted to go to a sushi place since she owns her own sushi restaurant. So, I made a reservation online. We valet park (complimentary valet) and went into to Uchi. We had to wait 10 minutes. It was a pretty quick wait. We didn't have to wait as long as the the rest of the people though.
