Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very good Â Fresh hot food. Quick! We did not have a reservation and there was a 30 minute wait so we sat at the bar. Excellent service! They are very attentive at the bar and they were VERY busy! We will return! Maybe in the evening for dinner because if brunch was this good I can't imagine what dinner would be like. Yummy
