JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Here in Midtown, a quick Google search will reveal a "pricey" average for apartment rentals and home-sale prices, and our location at The Mix is no different. In other words, goods and services in Midtown in general tend to be on the pricier side. That said, however, I believe JINYA offers a premium product at a competitive price; moreover, I will add that a great amount of work goes into (and has gone into) every bowl of JINYA ramen.
