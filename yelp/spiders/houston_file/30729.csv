The Pit Room////The wait was worth it. 5-10 minutes. The brisket melts in your mouth. The rib was very tender and flavorful. The Jalapeño cheese sausage was excellent too. Loved their potato salad, corn and green beans. They had some excellent jalapeños,  carrots, cucumbers. Their salsa was good and homemade hot sauces was off the chain. Loved their house made mustard too. There was plenty of seating even tho they were packed. Everything I ordered was under $35 and that is a bargain compared to how much other places charge for this BBq. Definitely will be back for some more!
