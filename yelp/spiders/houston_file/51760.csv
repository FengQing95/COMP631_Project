Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The bravocado toast was AMAZING. The rustic bread and red onion jam was such a great combination. It almost tasted Italian but had fried eggs on top which made it breakfasty. The bread was drizzled with oil but was still crispy. It came with a nice arugula salad with fresh Parmesan cheese on top and a glass of fresh orange juice. I wish i could have eaten every single bite but I was full after one egg/toast.
