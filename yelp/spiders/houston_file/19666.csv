Uchi////Looking back at my experience, I absolutely loved it and would go back for the server's menu. I would have liked to have known to say I preferred more fish entrees than the veggie appetizers we got. I wasn't fond of any of them. I will Â try the brussel sprouts next time since those seem to be very popular! I have lowered them from 5 to 4 stars because of the time we got seated. Our reservations were for 7:15 and we didn't get seated till 7:45. Luckily, we were able to have a drink at the bar while waiting but hopefully in the future, they can be more prompt and accurate with seating times.
