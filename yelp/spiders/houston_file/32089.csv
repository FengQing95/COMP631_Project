Local Foods////I ordered the salmon bagel with a side of cous cous and kale. I heard so many great reviews on this but holy-mother-of-pearl... the kale was ridiculously hard to eat. I felt like someone was squishing my face into the ground to eat a patch of grass, with a side of raisins in it. The cous cous was overwhelmed with carrots. As for the sandwich it was okay. The salmon was quite nice but nothing to sing home about.
