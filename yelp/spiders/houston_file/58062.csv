Kata Robata////Everything else was good, but the cuts of fish are too big and I like the nigiris to have some sort of compliment as well. To each their own right? I will say their cuts of fish were very fresh and not fishy, but I don't prefer big cuts of fish, and I like there to be some sort of garnish with my nigiris.
