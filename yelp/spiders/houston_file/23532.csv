Uchi////Overall, if you've been dying to try the raved Uchi, I would say give it a try. I would be surprised if, confirmation bias aside, you find this to be an impeccable restaurant. I don't find Uchi and Uchiko in Austin to be perfect either, but not bad for a splurge meal for inventive small plates and the chance to have a truly delightful bite here and there. I strongly consider the value I get for the money I spend when rating restaurants, and Uchi Houston scores low for value in my book.
