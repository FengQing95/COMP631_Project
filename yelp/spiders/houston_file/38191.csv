Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////something called or named a Bosscat Burger. Alleged to be ground beef. Maybe it is but it isn't prime and it isn't well prepared. So many places in Houston to scarf down a truly good hamburger. BuffBurger is one. Hopdaddy another. But this place while it may be currently a see and be seen place isn't really worth your time or money. There's a restaurant right across the driveway from this Bosscat place. Its name is Eloise Nickols. She's been serving memorable food for decades in Houston.
