JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were coming from a Houston rockets game and everything was closed except Jinya. Being from New York, ramen is something we were really familiar with and have high standards on. The place was pretty busy and smelled amazing. We had the Spicy Chicken ramen, kings tonkotsu black, and the octopus balls. The ramen was solid, nothing mind boggling but definitely tasty. The octopus balls I would definitely pass on next time.
