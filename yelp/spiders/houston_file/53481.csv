Kata Robata////Well I had a great meal here not too long ago and we were impressed with what we ate. My friend worked there for awhile and I totally forgot he did. Him and Charlie are good chefs and they made us a legit ass meal fo reals. Everything from the pork belly and rice to the O toro sashimi and the seared fois gras ... it was off the chain. They made us some special creations as well that were good so it was even better for us.. sorry :P . My girl works at a great sushi restaurant in Austin so she knows whats up. Their O Toro was like butta and it was very nicely priced on the menu..7 bucks an order? yes 2 please! Â We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back.
