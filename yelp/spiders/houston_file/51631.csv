Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was AWESOME!!!! They had so many menu selections and it was hard to choose. From the French toast, to the bacon and sausage. They must use organic eggs as two eggs did not yield as much on my plate (I wish I had more!!!!) and was a little sad. Overall..... I WILL DEFINITELY return and can't wait to get home to see how the ATL location tastes!!!!!
