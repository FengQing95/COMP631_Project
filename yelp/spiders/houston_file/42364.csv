Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries and desserts are delightful, but man, do they burn a hole in your pocketbook. My gf was raised in France and she says their baguettes are the best there is in Houston. Their almond croissants are ginormous and flaky and delicious. But buy a few desserts/pastries and you're in a $50+ hole. I get that it's really intense work to make these goodies, but have you seen their napkins and boxes and bags? I'm sure you pay extra just for the high quality (and really necessary? I mean, save the trees) bags.
