JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen place I've tried in Houston! Ive tried a number of their bowls and they've all been great! The meat is always so juicy and tender, and the broth flavorful. Such a cute place too, trendy and cool. Seating is limited so be prepared for a wait time, but it's def worth the wait!
