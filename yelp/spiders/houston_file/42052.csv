Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Brioche was flaky on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Clumps of sugar added crunchiness, nice. I wasn't terribly impressed. Other desserts looked very typical to any other bakery, cookies, brownies, tarts, eclairs, pudding, macarons. Dessert wise I was expecting something epic from this place like a friggin Cronut. I did bring this up to the staff and they were surprised they didn't think of making that in the first place. I'm hoping if they do make the Cronut, it'll be called "the Kenny" :D
