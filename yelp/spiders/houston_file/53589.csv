Kata Robata////For the sushi, I got the crunchy eel roll (I'm such a sucker for eel) and it was delicious.  Well packed, not too heavy on the rice and plenty of tobiko.  The hubs got the kobe beef roll which was delicious but a little surprising.  For some reason I assumed it would be raw beef and it was just barely seared (yes, it stated this on the menu, but he ordered it, not me).  While the flavor was fantastic and I actually enjoyed the roll a lot, I just love raw beef and think I would've loved it more that way.  He also got a Rock & Roll, but I didn't try it since he added cream cheese to it (blasphemy!) and I just won't support that kind of bastardization of sushi.  :)
