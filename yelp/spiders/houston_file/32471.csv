Local Foods////If I didn't already adore this grade-A lunch spot, then hearing a staff member call out this order detail would have convinced me completely. See, that's the thing about Local Foods - it's fresh, it's delicious, and most of the prep work is done in an open station right behind the cashier. These staff members take great care in providing you quality food AND flawless customer service.
