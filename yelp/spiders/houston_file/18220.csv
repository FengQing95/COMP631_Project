Uchi////This place probably doesn't need another review, but here it is.  Just go there.  Just go and order the Brussel sprouts and whatever else and enjoy.  We had the tasting menu and it was all great, the service, the food, the wine - except I didn't care for dessert.  Maybe I was too full or maybe it was just ok.  Don't care, cuz I will go back.
