Uchi////After 2 hours of wait, we were seated at the sushi bar where a sushi chef was assigned to prepare our meal. We started w the favorite hot dish item. #waluwalu (bottom left) is oak-grilled escolar, w candied citrus, yuzupon and myoga. The flavors were like fireworks in my mouth - buttery, citrusy and sweet . From the #makimono section of the menu, the #ham&eggs will stand out to #pork lovers - katsu pork belly, yolk custard, espelette. For Filipinos, it felt like eating lechon kawali rolled in rice, with sauce that rivals sarsa ni #MangTomas. #SOsarap Â Of course I couldn't pass on #foienigiri which is basically seared #foiegras served on sushi rice. It was #SOrich I thought I was going to have a heart attack! #SOworthit though. But we didn't realize that everything was just building up to one great climax - #friedmilk for #dessert - chocolate milk + toasted milk + iced milk sherbet... Words can't describe... #SOheavenly
