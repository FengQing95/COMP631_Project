Kata Robata////Excellent ramen although the noodles aren't created in house. The sushi is also amazing they really take pride in their sushi they always have hard to get Japanese whiskey as well which makes the experience that much more enchanting. Parking can be tricky as the parking lot fills up rather quickly with all the stuff in the strip mall. Make reservations and prepare to be amazed by all the greatness they put together also try the mac and cheese it is fantastic if you choose to go the savory route.
