Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Benny Duo (brilliant, as I'm incredibly indecisive): half Chile Verde, half Bella Bella. Chile Verde tasted TOO much like green chile (it just overwhelmed everything on the plate), but the Bella Bella was stellar - there's something about prosciutto and balsamic that makes the world go round.
