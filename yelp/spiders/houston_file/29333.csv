The Pit Room////Franklin's BBQ it ain't, but parking lots screaming "ocupado," over 1,600 Yelp reviews for a self-proclaimed "new" restaurant (actually just 3 years old), and lines intertwined like rush-hour traffic, suggest high demand and imply more along the lines of well-deserved than the potentially commercialized price-hikes that I have found taking over some classic BBQ standbys. Thus, I was very delighted to see Czech sausage on the menu, even more in light of the fact that its only other vendor is one of the aforementioned fallen mighty, Goode Co. BBQ, than that I could try some facsimile of Czech food after having recently visited there myself. Since my professional dining companions had ordered brisket, I resolved to order only sausage and try to trade with them, but the distraction of seeing the "Czechvar" logo on a Texas restaurant menu for the first time overrode any notion of rationality and led me to say "¡Ay, caramba!" when I realized I had ordered a brisket dinner. So, I resigned myself to spending another $3 in the name of bringing this proper review to you (donations appreciated), and just went with double meat. The requisite dollar-store white bread that raised the puzzlement of my born-and-raised Kansas City companion was piled atop the classically carnivorous combo, but then came the trip to the sides bar, where traditional American potato salad existed uncomfortably alongside Tex-Mex charro beans and elote, the latter of which I snapped up to complete the wall-unencumbered border crossing, along with the inventively designed charred green beans as "side two" of this vinyl record in the making. Passing down the line led me up to the drink bar, where a jealous hippie-bearded waiter poured me out a soupçon of Czechvar to relive my trip to Czechia, which I promptly left behind on accident and had to come back for due to my wondrous fixation upon the first Tex-Mex BBQ condiment bar, roasted habanero-tinged salsa and pickled carrots a quinceañera court of honor beside sliced raw onions, house made pickles, and jalapeños. It almost made ordering two meats superfluous, but now it was time to show three non-native Texans just how much a Texan could eat.
