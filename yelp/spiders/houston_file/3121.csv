JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food tasted great, but the bartender didn't take my gluten allergy seriously and I went to the hospital this morning. I asked if the curry was safe to eat, and I was told it is, but it was thickened with flour and now I am unable to move from my bed. I am contacting the manager tomorrow.
