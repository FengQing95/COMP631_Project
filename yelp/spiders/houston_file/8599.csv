JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant is beautiful.  The service was great.  The chicken keraage appetizer was crispy and delicious. He ordered the Sukiyaki Q Ramen and I ordered the JINYA Tonkatsu Black. The pork belly in the Black was tender and juicy with just the right amount of fat. We loved that you could get the soft-boiled seasoned egg or poached (he ordered poached for Sukiyaki).  However, the ramen broth itself was just mediocre.   I really wanted to love it but was disappointed. For my personal taste, Agu is better but Tiger Den is still my ultimate favorite for ramen.
