Kata Robata////Our server, Nick, was nice and helpful. Although I did request for nothing to be spicy and our appetizer was and he didn't offer to change it, just said that it was just a little bit and walked away. That was my only complain. But the food was so amazing I can't give this place anything other than 5 stars.
