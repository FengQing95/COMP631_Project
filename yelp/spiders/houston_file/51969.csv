Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've always been a fan of snooze but this was my first time at this location. Even though from the exterior it looks really small, they have a lot of tables inside and turn over tables pretty quickly. We waited for 20 minutes for our table which is one of the shortest wait time I've had for a Saturday morning.
