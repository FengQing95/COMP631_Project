JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm really happy to find a vegan/vegetarian ramen place because most of the ramen places I've been to used chicken/beef/pork broth as their base. I ordered the spicy creamy vegan ramen which was so good! It was a perfect dish to have on a rainy Houston day like today. The noodles were tender but not over done, the broth had a lot of flavor, not as spicy as I expected it to be and the spring onions gave it a ton of flavor. I asked for a seasoned egg with my ramen, the egg was half cooked with a runny yolk, just the way I like it.
