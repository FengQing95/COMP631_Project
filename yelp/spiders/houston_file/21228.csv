Uchi////SERVICE: If you are arriving for Sake Social Hour (5:00-6:30) get there early as there will more than likely be a little line. The best part about the line or at least today's line was that they were serving samples while we waited. Yummy salmon rolls were the bites today.If you are expecting someone, share that with the hostess so that they keep an eye out for your guests, makes it super easy to find a seat once the place fills up.   Upon entering you can choose to sit at the bar or outside while you wait for your party. Be warned that the place fills up quick so don't be "tardy for the party."
