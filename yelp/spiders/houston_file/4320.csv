JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ok but the staff always stares at me in my wheelchair and won't take my order directly they'll ask whomever I'm with but not me, it's kinda rude I'm physically disabled not intellectually disabled. The ramen is great, the other food is meh. Waiters could learn a thing or two about etiquette both east and west.
