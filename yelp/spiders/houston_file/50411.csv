Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A completely superb experience. I'll start off with the cons. The parking is an issue. It can be hard to find and some spots are marked as towing enforced so be careful. The wait is another issue if you're an impatient person. However the food, drinks and service are fantastic. Our server was Gabriel(I think!) and he was quick and communicative. I had Juan's Breakfast Tacos & the Abri-Ca-Lav-Ra Mimosa. The tacos were tasty with the shredded hash browns made for a great entree. The mimosa has honey and lavender in it so it was up my herbaceous alley! I was also have a rough day and Gabriel saw then gave me an equally amazing cinnamon pancake. I almost (ALMOST) regret getting my tacos but I'm completely satisfied. Definitely come by an enjoy the food. You'll love it!
