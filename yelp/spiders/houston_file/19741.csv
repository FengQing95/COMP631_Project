Uchi////If you're on a budget, go during happy hour and it won't hurt! I've been to both locations in Austin & in Houston. The Austin location was friendlier but the Houston location was a bit snobby but "nice because they have to" if that makes sense? Lol anyways, the reason I was there was for the sushi which is still impeccable! You might look at the descriptions and think ew but literally everything you try will be unique and have unique flavor a that's just delicious! Please try this place!! Great service, you will wait...but totally worth it!
