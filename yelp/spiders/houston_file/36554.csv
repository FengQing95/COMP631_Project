Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We arrived late afternoon around 3:45. It wasn't super busy but we were sat at one of the bar tables towards the front instead of the regular tables in the back even though there were several empty, the front bar tables were very loud with the music on and made it somewhat hard to have a conversation.  Service was good.  We ordered the pig candy appetizer, which was good, not overly sweet but good flavor. We also ordered two drinks, both were well done.  Our entrees were tasty, I got the shaved pork chop sandwich which was very large but comes with no sides, for 15$ I would think maybe they could throw in some fries.  My husband ordered the gold medal chicken sandwich added avocado (extra 2$) and again for 16$ nothing comes with it. We ordered the poutine fries to split since the sandwiches didn't come with a side.  They were ok, the fries were very thick, almost like eating a baked potato with the poutine, alright but not fabulous. The bill for 2 drinks, an app, 2 sandwiches and a 1 order of poutine fries to split was 100$.  Not bad just overpriced and not fabulous.  If I'm spending that much for a sandwich and fries I guess I expect to be really impressed.
