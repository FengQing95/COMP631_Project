Local Foods////This place is soooo yummy!! I love the spring salad!!! The dressing and cheese is so good. I also really like the miso soup its thick and creamy. My grad school bestie craves the soup all the time and there special lemonade. Tons of parking and sitting outside on a spring day is a must.
