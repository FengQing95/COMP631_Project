JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've seen people checking into this place constantly and have been dying to try it. It's right off of Louisiana St. in the same building as the 24 Hour Fitness in Midtown. I came in around 7pm with my boyfriend and was seated almost immediately in a small booth. I went into the restaurant not expecting much but was amazed at the interior. There is a bar in the front right when you walk through the doors. When you walk further in, there are two large community tables as well as smaller tables lining up onto the side. There's also a ramen bar in the back where the kitchen is. Immediately, I loved the atmosphere of the place because it reminded of Ippudo NY.
