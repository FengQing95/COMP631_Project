JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The business shares exclusively valet parking in a garage even during a time when there were plenty of spaces. It's a pet peeve of mine. The security guard blocked my car with his golf cart while I was trying to figure out where to park, screaming that I was driving the wrong direction even though there were no overhead signs in the garage stating so. Luckily there was plenty of street parking.
