JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Awesome decor, fabulous ramen! Had the Tonkotsu Black and tempura Brussels sprouts. Having recently traveled to Japan, I had a craving. This place fulfilled it and more! Rich broth, so many textures, and just the right saltiness and porkiness. Service was great for lunch too. Definitely will be back soon!
