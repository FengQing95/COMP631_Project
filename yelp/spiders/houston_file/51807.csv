Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also split the Chile verde eggs Benedict with a friend and it was DELICIOUS! My portion was quite substantial- I think when they divide it into two, they double the Pico de Gallo and hash brown you get so both of the portions get enough to eat which is amazing. I definitely recommend this. My friend got the taco and the portion was generous also.
