Kata Robata////Sushi ain't cheap, especially so here. One piece of nigiri will be on average 7 dollars. However, 10 pieces with a roll is about 30, which is pretty reasonable. The sushi we had was excellent. Great quality, but somewhat lacking....flavor for 70% of them. Oh well, I guess that's what you get for trying to stay cheap. The best was the tuna nigiri and surprisingly the shrimp. The tuna was really fatty and melted in your mouth like butter and the shrimp was lightly cured and really, really fresh.
