Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I live down the block and I was always curious on the hype since it always crowded. I ordered the pistachio croissant since it looked extremely vibrant green and the egg scramble. I myself have made the "soft egg scramble" which takes some time to make but well worth it. Anyways the egg scramble was a disappoint it wasn't rich at all just plain ol scramble eggs with chunks of curds but still on the soft side for 9 bucks.. no thanks! The pistachio croissant didn't really have much of a pistachio taste but it was still a decent sweet croissant. I'll be back for the pastries. The staff was friendly too so it wasn't too bad.
