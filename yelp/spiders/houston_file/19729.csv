Uchi////The chef was really helpful with suggestions.  But I had done my research beforehand and knew most of the dishes I wanted to try.  We ordered the uchiviche, hama chili, avo bake, karaage, brussels sprouts, ham & eggs, foie nigiri,  wagyu beef special, and the  fried milk.  The food was amazing.  From the food, to the service, and the way our dishes were presented and the timing, it was such a dining experience!  My favorites were the hama chili, brussels sprouts, wagyu beef, and the fried milk.  There were so many other dishes we wanted to try, but we couldn't even walk out of there, we had eaten so much.  I will definitely come back and get my favorite dishes and try some new ones.  It was expensive, so be willing to spend, but I thought it was worth it.
