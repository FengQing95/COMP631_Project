The Pit Room////We payed 147$ for the feast #1 and also one brisket taco. The food was okay, the brisket was kinda dry but the beef rib was really good. I feel as though it is a bit over hyped. We went right at open so it's not like we went when they were running out of the good cuts. I feel as though it's a bit overpriced for the quality but the quantity it's decent. The space is small but there's outdoor seating. There was already a long 30 min after open so go early if you don't feel like waiting
