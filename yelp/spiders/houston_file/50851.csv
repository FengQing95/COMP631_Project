Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went in on a Thursday morning, after 8.  I took a spot at the bar and was immediately welcomed by Teresa (sp?).  She had asked for my name and then introduced herself. I thought that was the nicest thing! Making it very friendly and inviting! Suffice it to say, service was just excellent.  There was an extremely positive vibe going on in the restaurant as a whole and you couldn't help but smile and be happy.
