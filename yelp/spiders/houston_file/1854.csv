JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Look, the food was pretty good. I can't deny it.  The ramen was excellent.  The fried shrimp appetizer was fine.  The takoyaki (about which I was very excited) was under-cooked; the batter was raw inside.  But overall, the food was just fine.  My problem was with the service.  A ramen house usually provides very attentive, very friendly service.  The service at Jinya was disorganized and disinterested.  Other than the obligatory (and tepid) "irasshaimase" the staff seemed to have little interest in the diners.  That, and the 15 minutes we waited to just order drinks cost the place two stars.
