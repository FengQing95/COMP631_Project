Baby Barnaby's////I'm still dreaming about their pancakes. Fresh ingredients. Guilt-free options. Service is fast and friendly. 80's music. Lurves everything about this place! And so does everyone and their grandma... This place can get super packed. Put your name on the wait list in the patio, chill out with some coffee, and you'll be okay. It's worth the wait!
