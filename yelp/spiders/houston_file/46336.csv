Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pistachio croissant was delicious! The color and glaze on it was beyond picture worthy. Then biting into it made me realize it doesn't just look good, it tastes amazing. Â It was light, not too flaky, with pistachio filling on the inside that added a nice texture without letting you forget you are eating a croissant.
