Uchi////Love.  I don't want to eat sushi anywhere else in Houston ever again.  Second time here was still as good as the first.  Only complaint, our server seemed less knowledgeable than I wanted - I would have preferred her giving more recommendations to give us a more well-rounded meal, more variety, because we tend to order things we like and I know there is so much that I haven't tried that I probably will love.  The one thing she did recommend was awesome!
