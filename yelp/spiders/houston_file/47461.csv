Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My girlfriend and I went to Snooze on a Wednesday morning and did not have to wait for a table. The dining area is beautiful with a lot of natural light and I love that the have a bar area. Don't let the bar area fool you though, you can definitely bring the whole family for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Despite a somewhat empty dining area at the time, we did have a long wait for our food but it was well worth it! The food was absolutely delicious and the staff very friendly and accommodating! I can't wait to go back!
