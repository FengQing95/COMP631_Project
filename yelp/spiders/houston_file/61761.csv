Baby Barnaby's////This place is always a hit! The trick to getting a spot without a wait is to go around 9am on Sunday so that there isn't a crowd or a long line. I always get their green eggs and potatoes because to me they're like crack!!! It's so addicting and the portion is very big for the price you pay! Also the servers and super nice and sweet. This place is LGBTQ friendly and has the most eclectic art decors on the wall. Parking is a bit tricky since it's street parking but I find that the spots around Hopkins and Stanford are usually available and safe to park!
