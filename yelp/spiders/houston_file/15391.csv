JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a chain, which adds in a confusing element to the exotic mystique and allure of the cuisine of Eastern traditional cultures. The same as you shouldn't trust a bagel or bialy baked by anyone that doesn't look like the spitting image of a hardy shtetl laborer with sensible Ashkenazi chest hair poking out from the top of a mostly unbuttoned shirt, so too would you expect something of the "Real McCoy" to be behind the production of an authentic ramen experience. It's a chain so it is just a bit different than the traditional mom and pop place where you feel like they adopted you into their family the first time you dine at their restaurant. Ohhh, okaachan :((
