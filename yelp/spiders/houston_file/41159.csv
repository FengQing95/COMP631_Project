Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Prices are kind of high but the food is great.  I had the chicken torta and it was really good!  Their chips are good too--very light and crisp.  The chocolate chip cookie was great too.  Went around 1:10p and was able to get a parking space.  Will definitely be back!
