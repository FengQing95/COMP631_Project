JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Here in Midtown, a quick Google search will reveal an average apartment rents and home-sale prices that surpass most of the greater Houston area. In other words, goods and services in Midtown tend to be on the pricier side. To that end, I believe JINYA does offer a premium product at a competitive price. And as a small-business owner and a self-proclaimed ramen connoisseur, I know that a great amount of work goes into (and has gone into) each bowl of JINYA ramen. And for that I will stand by our product and services.
