Baby Barnaby's////Wow! The food is likely fine!  The manager is not!  RUDE RUDE RUDE.  My son and I went for breakfast knowing that their would be a long wait.  No problem.  I asked for a cup of coffee. His answer was no and then he turned his back on me.  I followed him again and said I would like a cup of coffee and he yelled at me!  I asked for the manager and he said that he was the manager. I finally said we were leaving if I didn't get served a cup of coffee (again 1/2 wait!) and he said "we don't want your kind here".  Hmmm... my kind?  Not sure what that meant.  I know my "kind" wont patronize this rudely managed restaurant.  Theo's is around the corner and has a great breakfast, really nice staff and yes, they served me coffee while we waited for a table!  Go there! Avoid Baby Barnaby's. !
