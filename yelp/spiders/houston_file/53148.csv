Kata Robata////One of our stand-by favorites is the yellowtail collar, although we've been a couple of times when they were out. On our last visit, not only were they out of the yellowtail collar, they were also out of the sake-steamed mussels we tried to order. I have to say that is the probably the only negative thing I can comment on about the place- that sometimes they are out of the dish I most desperately want to eat!
