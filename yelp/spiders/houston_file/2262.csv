JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The interior is nice and there wasn't a wait the times I have been. Either I'm going at the right time or they are turning over tables super fast. I always get the Tonkotsu Spicy medium with dried seaweed and baboo shoots. That broth, man. My mouth is just watering thinking about it. I love the consistency of the noodles, the pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too heavy. I did try the spicy chicken once and didn't like it nearly as much as the regular Tonkotsu Spicy with pork. Boyfriend loves the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and gets it with the spice level of inferno and it is pretty spicy.
