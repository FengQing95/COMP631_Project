Uchi////Uchi is always spot on with their service and food. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. It's always a perfect dining experience whether it's for happy hour or for dinner. My all time favorites are the Brussels, ham and egg roll, machi cure, the hamachi nabe, Zen roll, wagyu beef, and the fried milk for dessert. My eyes literally lit up just thinking about that fried Milk. There's always a crowd, but it's worth the wait.
