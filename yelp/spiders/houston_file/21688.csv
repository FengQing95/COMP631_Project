Uchi////I'm not from Houston. Coming from Vegas I have my own standard when it comes to fine dining. It's the taste AND the service. Our waiter Anthony was a huge disappointment to our experience and frankly I don't know how he got hired. I mean, he's clearly a Taco Bell material. I'm not saying this in a condescending way, but really... from his pronunciation to his attitude and his lack of attentiveness... Â oh well.
