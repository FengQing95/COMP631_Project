Local Foods////Quinoa salad was not my favorite flavor wise. Chicken sandwich was pretty good and the chips were great. The sides all tasted ok my fav were the potatos and slaw. Not rating it high bc flavor wise i don't know if i really enjoyed their food and for the price idk if it was worth it since i didn't like it.
