Kata Robata////Okay, so I'll start with why I did not give them 5 stars.  Our service last night was terrible.  She was very nice and warm and welcoming with other tables, I would hate to think because of our appearance she didn't think we were going to tip or something, and I"m really not going to go into it further.  She seemed bothered and I wanted her to be as excited as I was to eat there. Was not the case.  She did not introduce herself or told us welcome, I am in the service industry and I think its really bad manners to start off with what can I bring you to drink.   She seemed bothered when I tried to order more food.  We went there to try as much as our bellies could let us and had been waiting for months for my son to come home from the Navy on leave to go on mother's day to Kata Robata.
