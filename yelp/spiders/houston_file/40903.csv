Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Was excited to try this place mainly for the fruity pebbles French toast, but then I got there, and they said they don't do brunch on weekdays. Was pretty disappointed. As a vegetarian, the options were kind of slim. I ended up getting the mushroom and Brussels sprout flatbread. It was really mediocre, wouldn't got back for it. The crust was basically pita bread, there was minimal cheese, and the veggies were minced giving it a really weird flavor and texture. All in all, not sure I'd go back - unless it was to try the brunch menu. The only highlight was how nice the service was and the trendy ambiance.
