JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I decided to try a different Ramen place for our usual "ramen Wednesday" date. The staff was friendly, the appetizers were very good; particularly the shrimp tempura. Unfortunately, the ramen was not up to par. The pork chashu was tasteless- which of course make the ramen. There is a possibility we would come back to try their other main dishes but I will not be having the ramen again.
