Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Reservations opened a couple months in advance on their website. $75 pp for a 5 course meal with unlimited non-alcoholic beverages. $25 extra for wine pairings. They must be celebrating Single Awareness Day early, because everything is meant to be shared family style-you are required to register in pairs. My twin and I snagged four spots without hesitation because we knew Common Bond would deliver.
