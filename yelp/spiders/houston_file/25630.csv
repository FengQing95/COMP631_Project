Uchi////-Fried Milk (4/5): A dessert to definitely try out! I can see why this is so popular. Everything was great! The only part that sucks is that the best part of the dish are the fried milk balls, but there was only enough for one per person (3 total), not to mention that they're tiny. Note that this Â also wasn't on the happy hour menu.
