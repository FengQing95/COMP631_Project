JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great vegetarian and vegan ramen options (2).  I had the spicy creamy vegan ramen with thick noodles and bf had vegetable soup ramen with thin noodles (w/ egg).  The Salmon Poke was so-so, it wasn't as flavorful nor did I like the wanton crisp.  I gave  this place 4 stars bc 1) the wait was crazy, 2) noise level is very high 3) parking isn't so great...but the ramen was worth it!
