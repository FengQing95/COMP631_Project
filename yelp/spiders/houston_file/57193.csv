Kata Robata////Some restaurants meet your expectations which is great, but when one blows you away ... that is what eating out is all about! In terms of the ambiance, I don't think this restaurant is that amazing. I am not a fan of the valet parking either but the food is really the draw here. Service is good and attentive. Our waitress gave good suggestions on what to order.Â
