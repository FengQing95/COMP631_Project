JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The "screaming noise" you describe is an integral part of our corporate culture here at JINYA. As a Japanese company that came to the U.S. nearly 10 years ago, JINYA integrated many service customs that you will find in Japan today, namely, in almost every business, staff are trained to yell greetings ("Irrashai") to show their enthusiasm and genki spirit. Genki (元気) is a common Japanese word that means "energetic, lively and healthy."
