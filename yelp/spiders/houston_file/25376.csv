Uchi////I recommend avoiding the rolls but to definitely try all their sashimi/sushi options if possible. One that really stood out to me was the unagi. I've had unagi in the US and in Japan but Uchi's preparation of the Unagi was my favorite. It was not too sweet, and it seemed like they had torched the top somehow but it was a little crispy so there was a perfect balance of savory/fatty/sweetness that came with the unagi. For the low price as well, it was one of my favorite items of the night.
