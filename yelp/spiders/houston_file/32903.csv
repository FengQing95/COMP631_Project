Local Foods////Sandwich Wise : I would say Gulf Shrimp and Blue Crab Sub Pretzel Bread with the lemongrass and For Salads I would say the Spring Harvest: The food here is AMAZING!!!  They said the Mintade is made in house. I don't believe them , it's so heavenly with the light notes of grapefruit caressing the acidity of lemon and lime.  The environment is hip and peaceful. The staff is helpful. I would recommend.
