Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Really enjoyed our date night out here. Whiskey selection is off the chain. Food was good though not amazing. Ambiance is cool and our waiter Omar was great and very informative. Started off with cocktail The Bosscat and Manhattan. Both very good. Bosscat is a great spring drink-citrus forward but not so much that it hides the whisky. 5/5 for cocktails. We started dinner with the Bourbon Chicken flatbread. Flavor bold and balanced 5/5 but the crust was a bit dry. I had the Bosscat burger with avocado and my husband had the Cajun brick chicken and added avocado and an egg per Omar's suggestion.burger was a solid 4/4. The potato wedge fries were 5/5 for sure! Super crispy on the outside like I like em. Husbands dish was a bit overwhelming for our tastes. The spice was so strong that it took over. My husband seemed satisfied and have it a 4/5. Next time I'm there in a Monday I'll go for the steak night. It got rave reviews from the table next to us. Will certainly be back for cocktails/whisky and potato wedges! Maybe some flat bread too.
