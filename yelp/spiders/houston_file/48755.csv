Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As soon as I could I made my way to Snooze. Heard a lot of great things from friends in Colorado, and couldn't wait to see what they were all talking about. Now I know! Food was great, and the morning cocktails are a fantastic way to start the morning. Always, always, ask about the pancake of the day!! How they come up with some of them, is beyond me. The bella bella benedict is delicious, especially with a nice cold beermosa!
