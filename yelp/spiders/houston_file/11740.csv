JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Cha cha Cha was really packed with flavor which was excellent. My question is why the heck does the special Garlic ramen lack garlic flavor when it's next to the tonkotsu black? The black had an intense kick of garlic which was crazy good and then the Cha Cha Cha just lacked it. Anyone?
