Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came around 11 AM on a weekday (since I played hookie) and it was about a 20-25 min wait. Not too bad, but was still surprised with it being a weekday. Parking was a bit of a situation since they have limited spots in their parking lot and so we had to drive around and around to find street parking.
