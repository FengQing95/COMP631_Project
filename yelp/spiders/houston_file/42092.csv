Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aside from the incredible product, the service has always been impeccable. While Common Bond is an insane madhouse on the weekends, I highly recommend coming in on a weekday around lunchtime. After the lunch rush, there is time to settle down and have a world class coffee/latte/any espresso based drink. The baristas are extremely talented and also super friendly. I had an incredible experience today just talking to one of them about latte art, and he not only showed me and my friends a little bit about the concept itself but also gave us a free flat white. Do not miss this absolute gem when you are in town!
