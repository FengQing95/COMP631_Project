The Pit Room////Went here looking for a good bowl of "Texas Red" chili. It was so damn greasy, such a disappointment. Great spices, but had to scoop out all the grease collected at the top. If they were to get rid of at least 95% of the grease it would be perfect. When you look in the container and see about a centimeter or more of pure grease on top, that's just too much. The brisket was delicious and moist. The place looks like a typical side of the road shack, but the staff are nice and the place was packed.
