Uchi////Uchi's service was impeccable! I would suggest making reservations because they are super busy. While waiting on the rest of my party to arrive I was offered a sampler appetizer before being seated. It is definitely an experience! We also went during their happy hour and most of the items on the menu was great! The foie gunkan was to die for!! The servers were very attentive and they also give you a thorough explanation of the items that come out and how to consume it! We finished off this delicious dinner with their fried milk dessert which was absolutely amazing!!
