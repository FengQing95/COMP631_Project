Kata Robata////Great menu selection and most of everything we had tasted awesome.  Overall a good experience. The kobe beef skewer literally melts in your mouth.  The ramen was pretty good, though a bit on the heavy side for me.  Sashimi was very good that night as well.  Same with the sake recommendations.  I would say while the sushi rolls / sushi / sashimi were good, the robata items definitely stood out from the rest.
