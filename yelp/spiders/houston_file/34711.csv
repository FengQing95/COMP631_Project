Local Foods////I also had a sandwich (also can't remember what it's called. The vegetarian one? I'm the worst at this), and it was amazing too! It has a TON of stuff on it: guac, hummus (most places just do one or the other), tomatoes, sprouts, roasted brussel sprouts, etc! So good! And the housemade chips are bomb.
