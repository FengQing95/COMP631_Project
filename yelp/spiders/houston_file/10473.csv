JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For dessert we ordered almond pudding with fruit.  It was very light and simple.  Nothing that I will be craving but was a great palate cleanser.  They top it with chopped strawberries, kiwis and melon cut into teeny tiny pieces and small dollop of whipped cream.  If I was craving ramen late at night again when I'm in Houston I would definitely come here.
