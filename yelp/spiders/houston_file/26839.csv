The Pit Room////Being in Houston for the first time, my friends and I wanted to try the best BBQ we could find. We couldn't have chosen a restaurant more perfect than this one. The place was pretty busy for a Wednesday night yet still had space to accommodate us outside. The fast casual/cafeteria line style of the restaurant allowed us to see our plates being prepped and also witness the employees pull the brisket out of the smoker. I had the brisket and pulled pork two meat dinner with a lemonade. For $19.75 it was a little bit pricey, but definitely worth it. The brisket felt like melted butter in my mouth and the pulled pork was flavorful and tender. The side portions were definitely smaller than I expected them to be but I feel like the quality of the meat made up for the lack of quantity. I had the mac and cheese and the elote as my side. Mac and cheese was lackluster meanwhile I enjoyed the elote. The lemonade here was pretty great since it was made in house. Would recommend It over any other beverage there. The smells and sounds of the restaurant really sold the authenticity of it being a Texas BBQ joint.
