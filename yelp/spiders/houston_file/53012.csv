Kata Robata////So what we have here so far is great service from Host Stand & the best ramen noodle I've had so far in Houston. But what about the sushi you asked? Well, the rest of the reviewers on here are not making up stuff people. They have awesome sushi here. We ordered fatty tuna, unagi, spicy scallops, sea urchin, mackerel & some yellowtail, All of which made the boyfriend smiled from ear to ear.
