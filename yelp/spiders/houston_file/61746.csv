Baby Barnaby's////The place is pretty small on the inside. So a wait around noon for a party or 4 took about 30 minutes. Time went by fast though. They have some outdoor seating as well, but we didn't want to sweat in the Houston heat. Â the service is always great, and the employees are always so sweet and fast!
