Kata Robata////What can I say about Kata Robata.  This expensive Japanese restaurant is my family's favorite.  We've been going there a few times a month ever since we moved to Houston 5 years ago.  I go to their sister restaurant Azuma often, too, but if I could afford, Kata Robata is my go to Japanese restaurant.  Well, wait a minute, they have Happy Hour!  They have Happy Hour every day and the menu is very reasonable.  Monday - Saturday 5 - 6:30pm and Sunday noon - 5pm.
