JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let me preface by saying that I absolutely do not like Ramen. It was my personal challenge to try something different this weekend and JINYA fit the bill for it. Not only did I like the Ramen but I also liked their appetizers and the egg inside the ramen (don't like eggs all that much either). Based on my photos you can see that the presentation is consistent and the service was wonderful too. The tea was authentic but not sure if it was microwaved or steaming on top of a bunsen burner because when I got my cup it was too hot for me to touch. Like unbearably hot. In my past experiences I have been able to touch these gaiwan like cups but this was just insanely hot. Thankfully my lunch companion liked it and couldn't stop raving about it's authenticity.
