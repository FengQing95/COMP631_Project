JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the spicy creamy vegan ramen because of the tips from other yelpers. I was a little hesitant because I am not a vegan, but I was very pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend it. The creamy broth was the highlight. The only thing that could use some improvement was the tofu...too soft and flavorless. I added a seasoned egg and it was perfectly salty and delicious.
