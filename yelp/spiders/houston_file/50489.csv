Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A few days later, my husband surprised me with a trip to Snooze on a Saturday morning at 9am. Again, not ideal. We sat there for the entire 45 minute quoted wait time. Once we were seated, I made some arrogant comment about how there is no meal in the planet I'd ever willingly wait 45 minutes for, and that all these people were just trying to jump on some cool bandwagon to be able to tell their co-workers on Monday morning that they went to THIS brunch spot.
