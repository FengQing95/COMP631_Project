Uchi////Whoever our server was, the name is escaping my mind, was honestly on point. Even if he forgot to give me my wasabi, I realized that the food is good enough without all the condiments and extra stuff that other restaurants need. We had 6 people but for our wait to be shorter, the hostess gave us a table anyway that we can all squeeze into. Our waiter recommended us a lot of dishes and he was straight up what was good and isn't. Some that I remember was the Walu walu, hot rock, and bacon tataki. The brusselsprouts are a must. I don't care if you hate vegetables or allergic or whatever your excuse is, TAKE THE TIME AND TRY THESE. We had all the desserts but I agree, fried milk was the best. The others ain't got nothing on it.
