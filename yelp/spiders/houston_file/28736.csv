The Pit Room////I love barbecue and eat it at least once a week. The Pit Room is right up there with Killen's and Gatlin's in my book. I love their fatty brisket as well as their point. Their venison sausage and brisket two-meat sandwich is a deal. Their beans and potatoes are solid (nothing noteworthy, but good enough to get every time I order the 2-meat plate).
