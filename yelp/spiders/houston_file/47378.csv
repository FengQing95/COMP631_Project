Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunching with my girls here was so much fun!!! They had so many great choices we just couldn't decide!!! I would def recommend sharing the pancake flight. The pancakes are so soft and fluffy! You can't forget SAVORY too!!!! This place has a full bar so you can have anything from mimosas, bloody marys & bellinis!!!!! Enjoy seating outside during cooler weather! The place is also super neat inside with a fun modern touch.
