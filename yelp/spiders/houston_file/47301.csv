Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pancake flight!!! There is always a wait so get there early and be ready to wait! The food is well worth it though and the servers are awesome!! The cinnamon roll pancake is all a carte and not listed in pancake flight.....it's a must though! The boozy chi is an amazing drink and such a perfect breakfast beverage. Tried it hot but may have to try it cold. You can't go wrong with any of the eggs Benedict. Can't wait until the new location opens up!! The only thing that would make this place better is if we could magically be teleported to Colorado as soon as you walk in the door.
