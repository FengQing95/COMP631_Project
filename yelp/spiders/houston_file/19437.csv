Uchi////I decided to come to Uchi for my birthday this past Wednesday.  Normally, I usually have impeccable service but for some reason this evening things took a drastic turn.  I had told the host that I had made 5:45 reservations for 5 but also have two other parties coming by 6:30.  I was waiting on the last person to make my party of 5 and initially we were seated at the big high table on the right side of the dining room which seats up to 8.  As we sat there and waited momentarily the Reservation lady decided to reiterate that we could NOT sit there and seat the last two who were running in at  6:30PM.  She said we would could sit there but would be immediately removed to another seating area if walk-ins showed up.  We couldn't "hold" the table while the rest of the house was definitely not "packed."  Besides, where's the first come first served rule come into play here?
