JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now, I stop to assess my situation. I've ordered the Double Inferno Ramen with Brussels sprouts (not the official name)!!! Sitting there is still a massive heap of noodles! I love it. I scoop down for the second go around. I feel like the Youtube girls that eat 4 packs of noodles faster than you can make them!  And you can make those really quick! If you don't know what I'm talking about..look it up..it's amazing. I get a to-go container and fall back into a slump. Paid...I don't know how much(forgot to ask).  All I know is there prices are reasonable. I Left to my next adventure into the clouds while my waitress bid me a fair well. JINYA you never disappoint! Oh, her name was Quinn!
