Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Omg!!!!! This place is perfection from head to toe. The line up is long but it passes very fast and smooth. The quality of their pastries is top notch. We order 5 different kinds one better than the orher. We order a capoccino and 2 ojs. The decor was nice and modern chic, the pastries were to die for and we absolutely loved the min we spent there. Highly recommended!
