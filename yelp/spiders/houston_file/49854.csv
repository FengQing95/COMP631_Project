Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On the other hand, I have a couple of complaints. When we we're waiting for our food, a dog came up and started licking me. I was so grossed out because I don't like dogs. Then once I was in the restaurant, our waiter started giving the dog food and petting it. I don't know if she washed her hands, but I do know that I was feeling uncomfortable. When a couple of kids starting playing catch on the other side of the fence, the dog stated barking like crazy. Here's me trying to enjoy my meal, and here's a dog barking way too loud. I don't want any dog germs on the food that I'm eating and I want to enjoy my meal(without barking). They shouldn't allow pets at a restaurant or any restaurant because it's incredibly gross.
