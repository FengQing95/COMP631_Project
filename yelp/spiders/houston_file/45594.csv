Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First, I have to mention that the line was quite long - that being said, it was Mother's Day weekend, so it's possible that more people were around compared to a normal Saturday. In case you've never been, there are basically two phases to the ordering process. First, as you wait in line, you can actually order pastries and other baked goodies. That makes the wait a little more bearable since you're trying to decide what looks good, whether you should order a croissant or something else tasty, etc. When you reach the cashier at the end of the line, you pay for your goodies as well as order non-baked food (which is the second phase of the process). Personally, I skipped the baked goods and ordered biscuits and gravy - however, I did get the chance to sample a croissant that someone in my party ordered, and it was very tasty!
