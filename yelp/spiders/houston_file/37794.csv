Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I like this bar because it's close to where I live. Its in a great location. I think this bar is trying to go for a speak easy look, but it confuses me with the sports tv and loud music. They need to work on keeping the tables and bars cleaner, and quicker. The bathroom attendant is a nice touch. Its a easy spot for company mixers.
