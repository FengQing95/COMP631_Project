JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the tonkotsu black and made it spicy.  It was ok, not the best. I don't think it was worth almost $18 with tip. I thought this place had an upbeat and trendy vibe. Quick and friendly service. Street parking  can be difficult during peak hours. The guard in the parking garage said I could park across the street at the fabric store, but idk if id take the risk of getting towed.
