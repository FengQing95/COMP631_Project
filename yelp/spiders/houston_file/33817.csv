Local Foods////This is a great lunch spot! We headed there at around the 11am hour to grab a work lunch out.  I had never been there before, but I can definitely tell you that it's critical to get there before the real lunch hour hits, as the lines to order your food can get long.  I really loved the ambiance of the place.  It looked really industrial but inviting and i'm a big fan of the blue booths.  What I also loved about this place is that there were so many healthy options.  I ended up getting the bahn mi sandwich and a cup of their vegan chili.  I thought the heat from the chili was just right.  I ended up taking off the jalapeños on my bahn mi because it ended up being a bit above my space level, but I thought the sandwich was SO GOOD.  Super flavorful, with enough veggies to complement the meat.  The sandwich bread was also not incredibly hard, which was really important to me.
