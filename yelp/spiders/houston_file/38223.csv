Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They had burgers specials so I went for that and asked to sub the mayo out since I hate mayo. The waiter came back and said it not possible. The manager then came to explain that it would ruin the desired flavor of the burger. We told them that's fine and we would like the check to leave. They didn't charge us for the drinks so we left a tip and left.
