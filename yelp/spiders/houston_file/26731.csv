The Pit Room////While on my last visit to Houston we decided to try the pit room to get some much needed Texas bar b que. The decision to try pit room was such a good one. I had the one meat plate with chicken, mac n cheese and the okra. I originally ordered the charro beans but they were out which was a good thing because in place I ordered the okra and it was my favorite thing about the entire meal. I've never had saut√©ed okra and it was AMAZING! Everything else was very good as well. Definitely money well spent.
