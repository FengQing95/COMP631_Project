Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////in summary, this is too expensive ($24 for just me) to be this gross, so i cannot recommend (should be only 2 stars).  BUT the chef does know how to cook (this got you +1 star).  most likely this is an issue fixable with training on how to season food.  staff needs to be (re)trained on how to keep food warm and fresh.  throw your coffee out guys, its gone bad!
