Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I usually order the Lavender latte and a chocolate chip cookie. Â The chocolate chip cookie reminds me of the chocolate chip walnut cookie from Levain Bakery in NYC. It seems like they have made slight changes to their ordering system, they have gone completely paperless which made ordering and waiting in line go faster.
