Uchi////I am baffled reading the 1 and 2 star reviews although not surprised as Uchi in Austin has also received lots of negative reviews about the wait times, and it's been open since May 2003.  I consider it a privilege to be waiting for a table - reservation or not - as they bring out some amazing appetizers on the house.  This is how I discovered their amazing tempura onion rings which are to die for.  They are a must try.
