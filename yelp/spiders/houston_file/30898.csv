The Pit Room////I loved the trough of bottled drinks but didn't get any. I also didn't get any beer or wine, which are the only adult beverages they sell. I did order a fountain soda and was VERY surprised to see the coffee in one of the stand-alone dispensers. Like, what? Cold coffee is an option with BBQ? Mind blown...
