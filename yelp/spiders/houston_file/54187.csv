Kata Robata////One of my friends got the 72-hour Kobe Beef and I think he "won" dinner. The beef was crispy on the outside and had a little crunch as you bit into it. The beef then proceeded to fall apart in an absolutely tender, succulent way. The fat and meat just melting in your mouth for an explosion of delicious.
