The Pit Room////My husband is OBSESSED with their okra.  As much as he loves meat, I think he would still come here to eat just for their okra.  Which is why it's so unfortunate that the okra is a seasonal offering.  We had the misfortune of discovering this a few weeks back.  In addition to the okra, I also really like their coleslaw.  It has a nice peppery taste that serves as a great accompaniment to the brisket.
