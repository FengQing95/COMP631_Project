Uchi////Dessert! At least one was included as part of the six course. Â We had the fried milk (with the fried milk "pieces" being the highlight more than the chocolate flaky stuff which was also included) and the lemon gelato which was probably our favorite dessert - nicely sweetened and balanced between the various ingredients.
