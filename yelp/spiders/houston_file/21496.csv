Uchi////Nasu (Japanese Eggplant) Nigiri- very soft baked eggplant with lemon miso sauce was delightful. The oiliness Eggplants naturally have with the lemon miso sauce goes together very nicely and brings a savoriness out of the eggplant. Â It also has an almost meaty texture so if texture if very important to you, do not fret.
