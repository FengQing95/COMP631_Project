Uchi////In terms of the food: easily the freshest sushi in Houston (which isnt saying a whole lot) but at least i know where I can get my hokkaido uni fix.  Kata was #1 until I came here.  When ordering the sushi nigiri I would just stick to the specials, and if its something you've never heard of, be adventurous and try it.  All the orders of sushi are for a single piece and the pieces arent too big (which is a good thing).  I will say although the quality of fish was pretty good the majority of nigiri do not come presauced (brushed with soy).  The experience could be different at the sushi bar.  The rice itself could be a slightly more acidic.  The temperature of the sushi they served was on point. Their scallops, toro, uni here are also very good.  In terms of the other non sushi plates, was not impressed.  Any dish where there is a sauce component, the sauce overpowers or is too salty or rich for the plate.  If you are a sushi fan I would just do all sushi, can get pricey as i have yet to spend less than $250 here.  I havent had their omakase, but most if not all the stuff on the omakase you can order ala carte.
