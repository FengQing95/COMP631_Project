Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went here the other day with one of my girlfriends for brunch. I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the Benny Goodman. It was saltier than I expected, but I still liked it. I will probably order something else next time. I also got a side of bacon that was really good, and had a few bites of my friend's order of the Pancake Flights. I actually liked hers a lot more than mine! The last thing I tried was one of their mimosas, which was really good and refreshing. I forgot which one I ordered, but I don't think you can really go wrong here.
