Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very cool vibe, great food, awesome red velvet churros and CRISIA was the best bartend I've ever come in contact with.  Get me some pebble (sonic) ice for my DC and I'll be in pure bliss.  I had the Cajun brick chicken with dirty rice, corn bread w huckleberry butter and it was da bomb!!  Inmost most curious about the dirty rice under the chicken and it did not disappoint!  I will most definitely be back!!!
