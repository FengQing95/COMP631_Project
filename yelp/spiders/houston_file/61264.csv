Baby Barnaby's////I come here every time when I crave American breakfast. I love how the portion size is big, so I can take some home after. Big plus on being dog friendly because I love taking my dog out to eat with me. Service is always great here but the wait time is longggggggg!!! I dont mind it though. Food is amazing and I love their fresh squeezed orange juice!
