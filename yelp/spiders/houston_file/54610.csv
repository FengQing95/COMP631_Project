Kata Robata////The reason that this review gets 3 stars is mostly because of service. I understand a 30 minute wait when we don't have a reservation. No issue. When we finally got seated, our waitress disappeared for a long time. We finally put in our order, and our food was served staggered. I think Kata Robata expects you to share everything. It was sushi. Then yellowtail. Then dumplings. Then my lobster mac and cheese. Lastly the ramen. I think the mac and cheese and ramen should have been served at the same time. But that's just me..
