Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here for brunch and the line was pretty long! Waited an hour to get in but it was so worth it! Parking is a little crazy here. I usually get the Almond Croissant, Brioche, and the Queen Aman. It's a good place to snack and catch up with an old friend.
