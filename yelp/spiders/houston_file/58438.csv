Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is the sole reason why I look forward to Sunday Brunch. My friend's and I go just about every Sunday. The food is great and the atmosphere is too. My usual dish is the steak(med rare of course) and eggs. Try it with the potatoes, scrambled eggs, and biscuits. I also have the chicken fried steak and eggs as well. The staff is very friendly, and efficient. Fresh squeezed OJ, fresh coffee. It's pretty inexpensive as well. Our tab averages $45.00 for a group of 5.
