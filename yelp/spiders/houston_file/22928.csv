Uchi////Uchi was amazing! Our sushi chef for the night was Ian - we ordered all the Nigiri on the menu and it was delicious. Sardine Nigiri was my favorite and Unagi was also amazing. Ian was super sweet and gave us a free flounder dish off the cool tastings menu. For dessert we ordered the Fried Milk - that was a must have. We'll definitely be coming back here! I live in NYC and have tried many sushi places and I think Uchi was one of the best sushi places I've had in a while. Fantastic decor - not too overdone and really attentive service. Such an intimate yet lively place. 5 stars!
