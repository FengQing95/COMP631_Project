JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Visited JINYA after half a year of having it bookmarked within Yelp. I was weary at first because I knew there was a difference between pho and ramen and I wasn't sure if I would like the difference. Well unfortunately I wasn't pleased with this ramen experience. As an appetizer, I ordered edamame, they were good and seasoned well. For the main course, I ordered the special ramen bowl that I guess was the monthly special, spicy lime shrimp. As a whole the ingredients were just too heavy for me. I guess I expected a lighter, flavorful taste. The broth was okay, but the noodles just didn't hit the spot for me. However, it was very filling. I wasn't too pleased with fried shrimp within the broth. I will say it wasn't extremely bad, just not for me. My friend wasn't too pleased with her meal either.
