Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I gave common bond a second chance and had lunch here on Sunday afternoon. I can say that the croque monsieur is delicious and the triple chocolate cookie will make you melt. My man had the soppressata sandwich and that was yum too. So I would give common bond 4 out 5 stars. Staff was super busy and a bit distracted which is probably normal. I just felt a tad rushed.
