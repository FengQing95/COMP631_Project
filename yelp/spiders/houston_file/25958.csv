The Pit Room////Came here the first day it opened and ordered the two meat sandwich with sausage and brisket. The flavors of both were outstanding. The brisket had great smoke and bark. The sausage had a great snap and texture. Also, the pickles, onions and pickled onions were great. Ordered an ice coffee on the way out and had a great experience. Will definitely be back. Glad to see more bbq joints popping up in Houston with this type of quality.
