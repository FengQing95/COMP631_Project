JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have to say that for my first time eating ramen it was absolutely delicious!!! I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. We did have to wait but t was not bad. They have a bar which helps kill time. Ambiance is causal and trendy. They sat us down on the long table in the center of the restaurant which is shared by other fellow hunger individuals. The menu is straight to the point, I ordered the number 1 which seems to be popular! With the first taste being flavorful and delish, I will return again! My foodie friends did comment that this was the best ramen in Houston, and I whole Â heartily trust their opinion!!!
