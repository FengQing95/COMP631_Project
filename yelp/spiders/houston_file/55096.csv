Kata Robata////We sit down, right before happy hour ends, and our waitress demands that we quickly tell her our happy hour order before it's officially over. Well, okay. I guess it wouldn't hurt to start off with some lighter dishes. Off the HH menu, we tried the Kobe beef tacos, the spicy salmon roll, and fresh catch ceviche. The portions are TINY. I'm a growing boy. If I'm gonna pay $8 for two 4 inch tacos, or 8 mini pieces of salmon roll, they better blow my pants off. But they were just okay. The ceviche was really good, actually - it was crispy, savory, lemony all at the same time; but still like 2 bites.
