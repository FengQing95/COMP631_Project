JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anyway, for the main course. I got the spicy chicken ramen (hot), w cabbage on the side and it was delicious. I expected crinkly, or rice noodles, like what's used in pho, but I got a more solid, angel hair-like pasta in the bowl. The soup was filled w green onions, bean sprouts, kikurage (which had the consistency of chicken gristle) and two tender, thinly sliced chicken pieces. The broth was really thick and flavorful. This place did not disappoint. I will be back to try other items on their menu.
