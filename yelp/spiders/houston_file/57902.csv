Kata Robata////Took my wife and son here to celebrate his birthday and truly enjoyed the experience. Our server was excellent, and the sashimi, robata grill, and rolls were fresh, tasty, and overall excellent. We stuck to the classic sashimi and nigiri and tried almost every fish item on the menu. They gave my son a matcha green tea cake to celebrate his birthday, which was nice and truly appreciated. Will be coming back.
