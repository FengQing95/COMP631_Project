Uchi////Ok, so while I was waiting to be seated in their outdoor bar area, I was recommended an excellent Sake that was served in a wooden box.  They say it gives the Sake some earthy tones.  I'm not sure if that was the case, but I did think that was pretty neat.  They also had a waitress walking around with some type of Tempura Fried Cauliflower that was salty (in a good way) and delicious.  Again, this was setting the stage for a great and memorable meal.
