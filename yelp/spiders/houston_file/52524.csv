Kata Robata////my friends and i got the hamachi and jalapenos sashimi and lobster mac and cheese... which is supposed to be an entree... as appetizers. both were sooo gooooddddd!!! the waiter told us the sashimi wasnt spicy even with the jalapenos. so i love spicy food and i thought it had a decent kick to it. so if youre a wuss when it comes to spicy food dont get it. if you can take the heat and like sashimi you will love this. its a cool spin on the dish. delish!! and for the lobster mac and cheese... omg i drool everytime i think about it. it was so creamy and rich and the lobster meat comes in good size chunks..... omg so amazing!! i will order that everytime i go from now on!
