Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went on a weekday morning, when I thought the morning rush was over and the kids were all back to school, clearly my timing was not a good one. Parking was a beast, it took me 10 minutes to find a decent parking space where my car would not get towed.  Although they were packed, I didn't have to wait for a table because I was meeting someone and that individual secured a table (yes, I was just a lil late), but our wait for the server to come over and take our order was a longer than usual wait considering how long we had been seated (I'm assuming they are short staffed b/cuz not all tables were full but there was a long line). Also, it took a while for our food to come out, and we didn't order anything fancy. Ok, now on to the food and service. The individual that waited on us was very nice and helpful, it was not her area but she was helping out which we greatly appreciated the awesome "TEAMWORK ", which is a plus in my book.  We ordered the "Snooze Classic" and the "French Toast Neat", I enjoyed both of them, although it took a while, my order was correct and my food was hot. My bacon was good and crispy, cooked like I liked and it wasnt salty. Overall, it was a basic breakfast really can't go wrong with the basics. Oh, my french toast was pretty good with the fresh sliced strawberries on top. This was my 1st time here and I'm going back. I believe I must try the "Corned Beef Hash" and the "Pineapple Upside-down Pancakes". Sooooo, with that being said, "I'll be back" (in my Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator voice )!
