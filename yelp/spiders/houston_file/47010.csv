Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVE this place! You know it's good when people are wiling to stand in the rain and wait for a table. The place is bright and clean, very mod decor. Food is amazing, local ingredients, and they give you PLENTY to eat. Coffee was great. We ordered a Sweet Potato Pancake, Snooze Spuds Deluxe & Snooze Classic. All DELISH. Our server, Kristin, was top notch. Parking is limited because it's Montrose. Place could definitely benefit from an outdoor seating area that is covered and has a couple of fans going. Can't wait to go back.
