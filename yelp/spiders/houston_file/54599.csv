Kata Robata////I had delicious salmon shashimi that I heard being described to another table.  (I can't find it on the menu.)  Also had tempura shrimp and vegetables, but I'd skip that the next time - the tempura coating was great, but the shrimp had some kind of taste in addition to shrimp-y that I didn't like.  Didn't taste bad or anything - I just didn't like it.
