Local Foods////I really wanted to like this place...really I did! It has the potential to be awesome but it just missed the mark for me. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday to find a line out the door. Not the worst thing, but when the big menu is only visible to those near the ordering counter, you need to invest a few extra dollars in printing more than 3 menus so people can browse the options while in line. Luckily, we found ourselves behind a good Samaritan who let us look off of his coveted copy of the menu. We decided to split the Crunchy Chicken and the Asian Salad. I was particularly excited to try the chicken as the menu led me to believe that it was a fried chicken sandwich. To my disappointment, it was simply a chicken sandwich with potato chips stacked on top. The salad was mediocre. The worst part was that I found a hair fried into one of the potato chips...yuck.
