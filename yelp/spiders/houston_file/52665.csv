Kata Robata////The winner of the 3.  Sexy scallop roll is something which i will definitely be coming back for.  A close second was a tough one and it would have to be the toro.  The crunchy eel roll was good with plenty of tobiko but it just wasn't that well..  crunchy..  as i expected.  Very tasty though.  As part of my ongoing quest for the best ramen noodle, I followed those up with KATA RAMEN.  The broth was a little on the bland yet sweeter side.  I suspect some people may like that better considering most places in town serve their ramen on the saltier side.  Noodles were good and the pork portions were more generous than other places i've been to.  For dessert, i opted for the green tea tiramisu which was very good but still strange to be inhaling the green tea powder in the same fashion Michael Scott did in that one episode of the Office.  The green tea powder, i can do without. the tiramisu itself..good but not the best i've ever had although good enough that i would have it again.  Before trying that, they also gave me a side serving of euzo (sp?) ice cream to clear your pallete.  That stuff is awesome.  I've had this ice cream once in New York and this is the first time i've had it in houston.
