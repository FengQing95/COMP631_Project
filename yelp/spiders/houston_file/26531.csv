The Pit Room////I'd say this is definitely one of the best if not the best barbecue in Houston. If you're considering going here, you should just go! They have amazing Mac and cheese, brisket, cole slaw, and queso! They've got so much more than that and everything is great. Try not to go too late because they could run out of their popular items!
