Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let's start with the fact that it took 7 mins for someone to even come to the table... I'm very understanding when it's really busy but it wasn't that busy..then when the waitress finally came there was no apology, she didn't say her name, it was just "what can I get you to drink". Ok.
