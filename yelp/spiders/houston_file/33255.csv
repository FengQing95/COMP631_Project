Local Foods////Recently, I decided I don't really care for crab.  The seafood salad sandwich here has just about changed my mind.  I, at least, love the crab meat in this salad, which is also brimming with large, fresh shrimp.  The truffle egg salad sandwich is to die for. I can't wait to try the salmon sandwich and the falafel sandwich. I'm in love with the potato leek soup.  Are you getting the picture here?
