Local Foods////Their Crunchy Chicken, Duck Confit, and Asian Chicken Salad are my favorites. The pretzel bun used on some of the sandwiches is definitely the star. My mom even tried to buy a bag of the buns to bring home. Yeah, they don't do that. I'm also not too crazy about their sides. They taste 'too healthy' and probably are, so I usually request a double serving of the homemade chips.
