Uchi////The brussle sprouts are delicious and definitely worth starting out with. All of the sushi was very fresh and had so many flavors that worked incredibly well together. We strayed from the happy hour menu a little to order a few pieces of sashimi; worth trying out if you are in a group. The portions on the happy hour menu are a little smaller, but all made to share with the table so that you can try as many things as possible. The normal menu portions are a little bigger, but of course more expensive. Worth trying at least one or two.
