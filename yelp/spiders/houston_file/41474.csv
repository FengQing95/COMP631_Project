Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////where no one was paying because it took the other 2 girls way too long to approach the customer, pull their heads out of their asses, deal with their hangovers and take the order then carefully box each baked item.  By the time my friend and I ordered croissants and got them, 8 people were backed up in line behind us while the two cashiers walked around getting in the other two's way, chit chatting, trying to figure out if they took their morning after pill or whatever.  For $3.75 the croissant is visually beautiful--no it is stunning.  The broiche was no better or worse than Croissant Royale's and it is maybe $1.75 extra here.  I could have driven to La Madeline and dealt with their complete lack of organization while getting a cheery Bon Jour from
