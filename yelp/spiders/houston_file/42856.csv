Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went on a Tuesday morning and it wasn't super crowded. Thank goodness. It's harder to find parking or seating on the weekends. The ambiance is super nice! I recommend the caramel or vanilla late, croissant, and macarons! The bread is really fresh! The macarons are moist and sweet. The lattes aren't too sweet either - perfectly balanced.
