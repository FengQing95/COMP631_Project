Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This little piece of cuteness is just fun to come to! Great for breakfast or brunch. I'm not going to lie, the line is a bit long and be sure to get there early or they will run out of items. The menu is quite short, which can be a good or bad thing, but for me the shorter the better, makes decision making simple.
