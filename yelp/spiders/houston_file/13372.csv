JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alexandra - Thank you for your review. Please know that you can request your ramen to be made "Less Salt," wherein the chef will reduce the amount of prebase that goes into every standard serving of our ramen bowls. Moreover, if you're ever dissatisfied with any item that you order, just let your server know and he or she will remake it until you are satisfied or try to offer you something more suited to your liking. Nevertheless, on behalf of my entire staff, I thank you for your patronage.
