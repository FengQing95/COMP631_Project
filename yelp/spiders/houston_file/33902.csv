Local Foods////Good dessert choices. Very super cute atmosphere. Large and open with comfy seating options. Order at the counter and sit with a number. Plus they have this mint limeade juice that is awesome for Arnold Palmers. The counter girl was very nice but the counter guy when I got my brownie was dismissive in attitude.
