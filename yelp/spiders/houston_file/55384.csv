Kata Robata////We only tried the tuna ceviche from the Happy Hour menu, but it was pretty good.  Lots of tuna for the price.  We ordered a lot of food from their daily special menu.  My favorites were the black truffle fish and the premium toro.  The toro absolutely melted in my mouth.  Seriously one of the best pieces of sushi I've ever had.
