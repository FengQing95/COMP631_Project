JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Generally obsessed with Jinya and eat here several times a month. Today was the first time I've ordered takeout and it was depressing at best. Half as many toppings / noodles as when I eat in. It was nice that they separated the soup and noodles but everything seemed so thoughtlessly thrown together. They really need to get someone on quality control and portion checking for the take out orders! Not doing this again.
