JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Is there enough to fit a group of 10? Yes! (They don't take reservations and most of the group has to be there before they'll seat you). There's two big tables in the center of the restaurant that can hold about 20 ppl each and smaller booths and tables on the sides. Nice d√©cor and atmosphere of the restaurant and very attentive staff.
