Baby Barnaby's////I can't believe I've lived in the area for almost 4 years and I have never tried this place.  I've really been missing out.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and ordered the green eggs and the freshly-squeezed orange juice.  I will never be able to truly enjoy regular orange juice ever again...it was amazing.  Word to the wise:  it comes in a teensy glass but you get one free refill.  The green eggs were divine.  You can sub veggie sausage for the chicken apple that comes with it.  It was delicious...my boyfriend and I debated over whether the waiter made a mistake and gave us real sausage (we decided it was the veggie variety), because it tasted so much like the real thing.  You will be in for a wait for a table (around 30 min.), but it's worth it!  We will be back!
