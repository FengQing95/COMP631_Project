The Pit Room////I was expecting the worst as I arrived close to closing time, but I was pleasantly surprised with some of the most delicious heavy smoked, thick bark peace of USDA Prime quality grade brisket I've eaten.  The sausage is a unique experience compared to most Texas BBQ, being coarser ground and more flavorful than most.  The pork sausage is just loaded with jalapeños and high temp cheese that oozes out.  Paired with the cold beer and old time country I might be in heaven.
