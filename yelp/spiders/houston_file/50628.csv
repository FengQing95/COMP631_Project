Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////"Benny Duo": We got the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman. Both were served on a little tiny piece of bread. I'm used to eggs Benedict being served on a large piece of bread, at least larger than the egg in order to soak up the broken yolk and hollandaise. The portions were tiny and tasted pretty mediocre.
