Baby Barnaby's////Nevertheless, I enjoyed it here! Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and our food was A1. We all had ordered the green eggs and decided to substitute the toast with biscuits instead, and HOKAYY what a great choice that was! Those biscuits were just the cherry on top of a delicious meal. Eggs were cooked perfectly - not too runny or overcooked - while the potatoes were seasoned to my exact liking. The sausage was also an added delight so can't forget about that. Mimosa could've had a bit more champagne, but I think that's just the alcoholic in me talking.
