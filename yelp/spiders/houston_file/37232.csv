Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The overall ambiance and vibe of the restaurant is very casual, but more so leaning towards casual formal. With that note, it isn't exactly a spot to go to if you're just going to throw a dart at the map and say, 'Let's go there!' I would say that it is a great spot to go to if you're going on a casual date, or you and a group of friends want to experience something new.
