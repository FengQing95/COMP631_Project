Baby Barnaby's////We had brunch at Baby Bar any' sand were pleasantly surprised with the quality, portions and savoriness of the food.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed and exceptionally tasty.  The meal was complemented by our server, Scott.  He was attentive and pleasantly humorous, adding immensely to atmosphere.  Commended highly!
