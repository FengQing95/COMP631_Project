JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Who knew ramen could be SO good? We had the Spicy Chicken ramen and the Toku black. The spicy chicken ramen had the perfect amount of spice... it was amazing. The staff is also extremely welcoming! Humza, our server, was awesome and helped us pick the two ramen that we loved. Give this place a shot.
