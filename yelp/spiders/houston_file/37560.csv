Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My sister got the meatloaf hash and eggs which wasn't good. I got the sunday scramble which was good. My sister and her friend got mimosas. The guy filling up bottomless mimosas refilled their glasses but they didn't charge them for it since they didn't order bottomless.
