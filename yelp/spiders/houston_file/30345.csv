The Pit Room////As I came to order, the special was Wagu Beef Ribs! OMG! The thing is as big as my forearm and could feed a small village. If it wasn't two pounds I would be surprised. Additionnallly Â I chose to try the venison sausage and a side of Mac and Cheese. They don't disappoint! As I uncomfortably sit here attempting to write this review I salivate over the incredible flavors and smells I enjoyed and are amazed that I am so full from essentially so little.
