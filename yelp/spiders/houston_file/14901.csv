JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This time I tried the smalls plates: the Caramalized Cauliflower and the Crispy Chicken. The Cauliflower was nothing special, I could have made this at home, and it was a little bland, not worth the $4 in my opinion. The Crispy Chicken, now this was GOOD, I would definitely get this again. Huge chunks of tender and fried, dark meat chicken. VERY GOOD. I recommend!
