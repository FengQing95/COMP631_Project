Uchi////Order what UCHI is KNOWN for- fresh fish, creative dishes and desserts (we ordered two - don't judge). Do a little research on what to order, and the experience will be well worth it. Ask the waiter for suggestions.  We had excellent service. Waitress was very enthusiastic about the food UCHI serves and I can understand why.   Okay so one point of the meal, my bf and I took a bite of our nigiri sushi upside down as instructed by our waitress (fish on tongue, rice facing roof of the mouth).  Bf and I looked at each other searching for a reaction. ..no words were exchanged...just a smile and a slight nod.  The idea was to fully taste the Yuzu Kosho with the fresh fish together first vs having the sushi rice interfere or get in the way between the fish and your taste buds. That's when I knew I loved you Uchi! The yuzu kosho salt is delicious.
