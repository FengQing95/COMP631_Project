Baby Barnaby's////I don't get the appeal of this place at all.  It's tiny, nowhere to park, and the food is just plain average.  It seems like the tinier you are and the less parking you have, Houston will automatically elevate you to some kind of iconic status as a "hidden gem".  I can understand if you live around this area and can walk to it to grab a bite, but I would never ever, ever make the drive to eat average food.  I may be in the minority here, but I was not impressed.
