JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite ramen place in Houston. It comes in close to Ippudo in New York. I'm not really a huge of ramen, but I like it from these two locations. There's always a wait, but if you're a party of two, try to steal a seat at the bar and you'll get served right away! It is a bit pricey for example the add ons, the corn costs $1....... and 3 wontons costs $2 which i don't think is worth it. It's better to just get the ramen as it comes. The parking sucks cause there are so many different shops that share that one garage. I suggest to come at odd times to avoid traffic and to not wait for a table. Just a heads up that they have huge tables in the middle that fill up with different parties that some people could find off setting and awkward.
