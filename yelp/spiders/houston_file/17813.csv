Uchi////A friend and I were meeting another friend and his girlfriend for an early dinner shortly after they opened at 5pm. 3 out of the 4 were present with the other in our group 5-10 minutes away. It had just opened so 85%+ of the tables were unoccupied but we had to wait awkwardly in the cluttered entrance walkway for our 4th to arrive before we could get seated (I can only imagine it being chaotic when the restaurant is actually packed at peak times when many are waiting to be seated).
