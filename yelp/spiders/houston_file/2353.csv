JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When I found out that Houston had finally opened up a decently legit ramen bar, I came here pretty pumped and with semi high expectations. I will say that I left feeling pretty disappointed though, as my meal was pretty underwhelming. If anything, the ramen here is nothing more than average.
