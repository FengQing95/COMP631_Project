Local Foods////Both sandwiches were a 5/5.  The pretzel bread that they were on was REALLY phenomenal as well.  The edges of the bread were crispy and salty and just oh-so-good.  The soup came with potato chips on top which is such a clever idea, I can't believe my inner fat kid never thought of it sooner!  The soup was piping hot, not lukewarm, which matters.  On a cold, rainy day where you spent half of it pushing a car out of a flooded street, you want HOT soup!!!
