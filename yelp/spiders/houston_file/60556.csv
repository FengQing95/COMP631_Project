Baby Barnaby's////The first thing we liked was the free coffee outside while you waited. Although each container only held about 5 cups, and ran out quickly. The food was excellent, especially the very fresh squeezed orange juice. I ordered the corned beef hash with two fried eggs, sunny side up. The food was excellent, however, I kinda wanted some more corned beef. The fruit cup was fresh, and delicious.
