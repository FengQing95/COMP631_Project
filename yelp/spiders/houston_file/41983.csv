Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We had 2 coffee; macchiato and one vanilla latte with croissant and some other pastry. The latte had a strand of hair on the top of the coffee. We complained and they returned my money but didn't appoligized nor did they bother to comp my drink. I come here twice a week & spend $16-$24 and they can't even give me a free coffee for leaving a bad taste in my mouth. This is definitely not Starbuck's customer service. Not that I like Starbucks but their customer service is worth it.
