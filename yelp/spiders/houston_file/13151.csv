JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I understand equipment goes down.  My issue was not the fact we had a wait.  My issue was there were plenty of open seats and they would not sit anyone.  So instead of waiting at a table (comfortable), maybe ordering drinks, appetizers, other food not needing the fryer, we were left standing like cattle by the front door. A couple came in 40 mins after we arrived, sat at the bar and had their food (ramen) before we were even seated.  That is not an equipment issue- that's a service issue sir.
