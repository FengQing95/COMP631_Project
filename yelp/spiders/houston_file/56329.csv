Kata Robata////Part of the Azuma chain, Kata Robata has the same excellent Japanese food at a higher price range, fancier environment, and with a slight fusion twist. We came here as a party of six on a Sunday soon after opening and were able to be seated right away. Because of how expensive the food here is, we arrived during happy hour (Mon-Sat 5-6:30pm and Sunday 12- 5pm) and ordered a nice selection of different small plates to start off our meal.
