Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is absolutely fantastic - every city in Texas deserves a little hide-a-way cafe like this. It's European in style and offers a variety of breakfast/lunch options ranging from bakery items to kitchen prepared entrees. When a friend and I dined, I purchased an almond croissant, vanilla latte, and an arrangement of 6 macarons, all of which were superb. Common Bond is locally owned and is nestled along an adorable strip of boutiques/restaurants in midtown Houston - definitely someplace worth your time and money. It was my first time visiting Houston after living in Europe for quite a while, so a quaint cafe with sophistication and quality food is exactly what I was searching for, and exactly what I found at Common Bond. Two thumbs up!
