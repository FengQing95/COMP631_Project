Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only con is that they should improve on getting the table clean quick. It took a while to flag down a server to take away the trash that was left behind from previous customer. I end up wiping down my own table. There were also a few other dirty table that didn't get clean fast enough for new customers. Im sure common bond know that they are busy and should be prepare for this.
