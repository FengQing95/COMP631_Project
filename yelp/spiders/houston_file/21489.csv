Uchi////I've been temporarily living in Houston as I'm getting cancer treatment at MD Anderson. Man I have had fun exploring the different restaurants here! However, the first time I went to Uchi, (unfortunate for the other restaurants), I just had to keep coming back! My husband and I even went 4 times within 2 weeks (slightly embarrassing as the staff recognized us by name!). The service and atmosphere is top notch (there's always someone walking by to fill/refill your drink and/or clear empty plates) ... but the food, THE FOOD! I have yet to try something I didn't like. I keep going back mainly for the Hama Chili (and the brussel sprouts, and the fried milk dessert), but honestly, you can't go wrong. Their Sake Social menu is awesome; feel free to order 1-2 things at a time, have a few delicious bites, and then order 2-3 more things after that! (That's what I do!) The goodness keeps flowing onto the table.
