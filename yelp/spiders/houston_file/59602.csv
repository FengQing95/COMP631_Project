Baby Barnaby's////Once you are seated, the service is pretty good. The fresh squeezed orange juice is great, so if you like OJ get a glass. I've had the migas (add chorizo) and the green eggs so far and both were excellent. I prefer the migas, but they are much heavier and a bit greasier than the green eggs. The apple chicken sausage that comes with the green eggs is also delicious. Both trips have been very pleasant and I definitely plan on eating here again next time I am in Houston.
