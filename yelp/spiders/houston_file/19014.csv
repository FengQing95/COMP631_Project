Uchi////In my dreams, a Monolith appears in space.  Solid, beautiful, and...pink.  Pink like the perfect piece of tender fish.  The orchestra begins the theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Duh, duh, da-duh! The Monolith then moves forward, and into my mouth.  The effect is a close second to mankind gaining sentience: pure food ecstasy.  That is the Uchi experience.
