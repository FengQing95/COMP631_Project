Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were seated promptly, parking was tight.. I ordered the huevos rancheros and my gf ordered the chilaquiles plate. The coffee was a little stronger than I cared for and the half and half is the only type of options they have besides raw sugars, etc.. I got a little annoyed that I had to stare down the waitress to bring us a refill, our food took a long time to be prepared, it was busy. After our food was served the waitress did check on us, but I was expecting her to bring refills of coffee, which she didn't in fact she was MIA... There were several servers in the restaurant to accommodate the patrons and I noticed our waitress was no where to be found when I got up to use the ladies room. Needless to say we had to ask someone else to bring the check. So my grade is rather low because: waitress wasn't very attentive and I didn't get a good vibe from her, too bad. The food was okay but not like OMG this is so good. The temperature of my food wasn't hot nor cold just warm and it lacked flavor, seasoning something. I feel that it was a lot of hype built up for this place. And we also ordered the OMG french toast and the portion was small that didn't justify the price. Our bill was $40 I feel that's pricey but that's because their menu is unique but not fantastic and the service was lack luster.
