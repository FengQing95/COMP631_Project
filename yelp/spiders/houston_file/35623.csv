Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Go for the burger hands down. I've had about a dozen different things on the menu, most of them are decent but the burger is awesome and 100% the way to go. It's hella loud in here so don't go for an intimate conversation or anything. Or maybe even any conversation unless you feel like yelling. Drinks are great and bartenders are awesome.
