JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really enjoyed my experience here. The truffle fries are DELICIOUS and the service was exceptional. However, as a vegetarian, my options were very limited, and I felt like the quality of my ramen suffered. The soup was, for the most part, flavorless. The bowl was also overflowing with cabbage to the point that it was very difficult to eat. However, my friends who ordered meat-based ramens raved about their meals! So, unless you're a vegetarian or vegan, this is a must-try for Houston.
