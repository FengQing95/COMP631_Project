The Pit Room////It's set up cafeteria style with the sides all spread about.  You may find more tender ribs outside the loop, but these were tasty.  Good smoke, some char, and fall off the bone delicious.  The brisket had strong flavor too.  The BBQ sauce can be a little intense with the vinegar/black pepper (heart burn warning) but I poured it on anyways.
