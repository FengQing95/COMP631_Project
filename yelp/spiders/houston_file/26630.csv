The Pit Room////As loyal, devoted Goode Co fans, it felt a little treasonous  to try this place.  There's a lot to like here.  Delicious brisket and ribs, turkey and sausage.  The chicken was moist and tender but almost over cooked for my taste.  The mac and cheese is delicious, but not a fan of the beans.  The relish bar is exceptional.  It's a great alternative to other local places and has a very hip, adult feel.
