Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Besides the fact that the parking is a bit inconvenient, they created a separate parking spot a little ways over for more guests to park. Good idea since this place is VERY VERY packed. Other than that, this place is the cutest pastry place I've been to in all of Houston. Their pastries look so fresh and their cakes aren't super super pricey either. Their Brunch menu is utterly amazing. My boyfriend and I came here and he almost dragged me away if I wasn't stubborn enough to just stay put in the line. I would've never forgiven him because the food is here is amazing! I ordered the Beef & Grits and the Beef was so tender; the broth from the pearl onions and mushrooms is so flavorful. I also ordered the Lavender Latte which did have a slight lavender scent and taste but it wasn't too strong; just right! I also got the Kouign Amann which is one of the ugliest looking pastries but please trust me when I say it was DEE*LISH*US Â Cannot wait to come back and try something new again!!
