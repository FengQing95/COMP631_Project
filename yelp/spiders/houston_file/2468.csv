JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The best Ramen in Houston that I have ever taste so far. I have tried almost all of the ramen and appetizers, for me, appetizers are quite normal, nothing really special or stand out. The ramen that I love the most is Premium Tonkotsu White (IMO, it is better than Tonkotsu Black) with thick noodle. I like thick noodle more than thin one, you can just tell them which noodle that you would like to eat. And don't forget to save some space for Annin tofu, it is almond pudding with fruits on the top, it is not too sweet and the taste is just right, if I can, I want to eat two of them every time I dine here. The decoration and atmosphere is very modern, elegant and fancy, and the price is just right. Good for group dining or for dates.
