JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I haven't been to too many Ramen places but I'd say from the places I've been to, Jinya's pork chashu has been phenomenal. Melts in your mouth. Also my first time trying takoyaki but it was also really good, a little smaller though than the ones from that Anthony Bourdain episode but at least you get like 5 of them. Atmospheres cool and the hours are good. Â Pork gyoza is average though but you get 8 of them so you can't go wrong if you're with a group. Great place, everybody should check them out.
