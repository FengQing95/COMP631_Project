Local Foods////The line flowed faster than expected and the food came out rather quickly. I had the crunchy chicken sandwich and I am kinda pissed I did. It was deli sliced chicken meat with pieces of crumbled potatoes chips inside. I was under the impression this was going to be a battered chicken breast patty but it wasn't. The tomorrow's were old and forty tasting and the sandwich had absolutely no flavor to it. Neither did the chips.
