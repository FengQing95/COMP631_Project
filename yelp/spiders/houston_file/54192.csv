Kata Robata////My favorite lunch spot, and I totally don't mind sitting alone with my baby to have one of the most satisfying lunch here. I always order the Kobe beef teriyaki lunch combo. I opt for rice and the rice here is so moist and soft but not mushy. The beef cubes are fatty and tender. Yums Yums, drooling as I write this review. Took off a star due to no baby changing diaper area in the restroom.
