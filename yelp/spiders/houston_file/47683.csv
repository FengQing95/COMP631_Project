Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////AMAZINGGGG! This place has easily become my new favorite brunch place. My girlfriend brought me here, and we immediately saw the line when we walked in. At this point, I was like..."this place has already started off at a 4) lol. We were told the wait would be an hour...so I was initially annoyed, but they had games like (connect 4, jenga, and cornhole amongst others to make the time go by). My girl had the mule (so refreshing..as I'm not a fan of mules, but this one had the right amount of everything ....gin, lime, the whole bit). I ordered the "OMG ..french toast"...and it DELIVERED!! My girl had the pineapple upside down pancakes....SCRUMPTIOUS! My tastebuds felt like they were in heaven. I kept staring at my girl like how could you have kept this place a secret all this time! The portion was filling and every bite was delicious. I will definitely be going back. Oh yea the decor and ambiance seemed modern, "on the go," etc.
