Uchi////I've been hearing rave reviews from all my friends about how great this place is....i maybe it was the hype and build up - I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes, it's pretty food, pretty people, the waiters can talk ad nauseum about hints on elderberry in the wine and name drop local growers....but at the end of the meal...all I wanted was a to Â taste a delicious piece of raw fish. If you like sushi rolls, you will probably love this place. If you love raw fish....you'll probably walk out scratching your head as I did.
