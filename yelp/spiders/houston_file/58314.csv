Baby Barnaby's////So I followed the yelp crowd and for the green eggs and they were delicious! I got there pretty early and there were plenty of people there already. I got the green egg plate but advised the waiter that I did not want the meat the dish it came with and they substituted fruit at no additional cost. I want to try their pumpkin pancake.
