JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My go to ramen spot and my go to order: spicy chicken ramen (inferno!!!) with an egg and fresh garlic. SLURPPPP! I think I really got into ramen after Jinya because I like realized I like lighter flavors aka chicken rather than more classic flavors like miso/pork. I also like their seaweed salad and totally need to try more of the apps because they have some awesome looking stuff.
