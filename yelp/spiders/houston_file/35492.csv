Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So glad that this place opened up!  Not only can you have great food but it is also place to hang out with friends for good drinks.  We intended to have dinner here and make our way to another bar for drinks. However, that was before realizing this place has it all.  It was already packed when we arrived thankfully they offer complimentary valet which made it so much easier for us. Even though it was busy we were seated after a short wait.I ended up ordering the bosscat burger and fries because I was being a creeper and it looked delicious sitting on the plate in the table next to us.  I was not disappointed! It was a great choice.  Tasty burger that came with some pretty tasty carb-a-licious fries!  They also boast a pretty extensive drink list.  They do emphasize the Whisky but definitely offer tasty cocktails.  They are a bit pricey but definitely in line with cocktail prices. The customer service was also on point all night long and the valet on the way out was quick.  This place delivers on all points!​
