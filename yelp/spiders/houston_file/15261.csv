JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my go to ramen place. Nothing I have eaten here is just fine. Everything is amazingly delicious. This is one of those only ramen places that serves a lot of chicken broth options. Spicy Chicken Ramen is the star on the menu. Crispy chicken is one that you shouldn't miss. Try it with the hot sauce on the table. Tastes much better that way. Always wonder what brand that hot spice is. I'd love to have that readily available at home to eat with other foods.
