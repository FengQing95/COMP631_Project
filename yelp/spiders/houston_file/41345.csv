Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kugelhopf, ratutouille open face sandwich, lemon tart, chocolate chip cookies and chocolate peanut butter cupcakes are all recommended. Only reason I have to take off a star is because I found a hair in cookie. I really have to like a place to still recommend it after such a gross ordeal. I would suggest they wear those school cafeteria lady caps while baking. If they did, I would go back when I am in town again. Clearly, the pastry chef(s) are very talented, but hygiene is a must! Especially when the goods ain't cheap for us "common" folk.
