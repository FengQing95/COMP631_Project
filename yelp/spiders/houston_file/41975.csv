Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If I was rating the food on looks, it would get a 5 star rating.  The service was nice, too.  However, we ate the restaurant weeks dinner and it ranged from ok to weird.  The cold vichyssoise was like bitter foam with a strong sour cream taste.  The pork belly was mostly fat, almost zero meat.  The crab cakes were ok, but they lay on a bed of really hard vegetables.  And the turtle brownies were really hard and just OK.  And on a side note, their restrooms are out in the foyer so you have to go backwards through the narrow order line to go back out to get to them which is very awkward.  For their prices I don't think I would gamble and go back for anything else.
