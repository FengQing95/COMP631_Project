Uchi////Yokai berry- (5/5) I loved this dish! The salmon was so fresh while the mix of fruits made the dish really refreshing. It was a nice blend of flavors and I'm so sad to hear they're going to take this off the menu! (They're still going to keep it at the Uchi in Austin). Hopefully they replace this dish with something equally as appetizing.
