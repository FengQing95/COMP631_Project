The Pit Room////I tried a this new barbecue spot because I've nothing but great reviews but when I went there this weekend I wasn't impressed. The meat was dry lacked seasoning. The portions was on the small end as well. I got the three meat plate and it was okay Â This restaurant shouldn't be as high of a rating. 3 stars is enough.
