JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We started off with the JINYA bun, brussel sprouts tempura, and the crispy chicken. The JINYA bun and crispy chicken were my favorites. The JINYA bun had the Chashu pork, and was garnished with pickles and lettuce. The pork was tender and very flavorful. The crispy chicken was a big hit at lunch. It's essentially dark meat chicken, but the batter and chicken are seasoned well. It comes with a side sauce, but it wasn't necessary since the chicken was delicious by itself. The brussel sprouts were ok. I couldn't taste the truffle oil at all, and overall the dish was bland. If it came with a tempura dipping sauce that would have helped. I wouldn't order the brussel sprouts again.
