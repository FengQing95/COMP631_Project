Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambience here is excellent. The sides are incredible. My daughters loved their chicken sandwiches and one got a tasty burger. The most expensive thing on the menu is the steak. Don't do it. Just don't. It's just not good. My wife and I both got our own and while the baked potato and green beans were incredible...the steak was tough and difficult to enjoy. They call it chef's cut (which is typically a hanger steak), but this was the worst I've had for chewiness and flavor. Overall an unpleasant experience. Since everyone else enjoyed their meal, we decided to just let it go, but then I figured I'd warn y'all. If you're looking for a juicy medium-rare choice steak...this ain't it. My hunch...grill wasn't hot enough to really render the fat to make it tender.
