Uchi////Uchi's dedication to impeccable service is evident from the moment you walk in the door. We got there right around 7 on a Friday night expecting at least an hour's wait (no reservation) and were pleasantly surprised when the hostess said it would only be about a 30 minute wait - Â long enough to have a cocktail on the patio before dinner, perfect. I love the fact that if you're waiting for a table they just put the bar charge on your table check - no faffing around with money at the bar. We got lucky and got seats at the sushi bar - exactly what we were hoping for. Paolo was our sushi chef and he was AMAZING. Sitting at the sushi bar is literally like having your own dedicated chef for 2 hours. We ordered a dizzying array of specials and Uchi classics (I've been studying this menu for YEARS, y'all) and Paolo offered lots of helpful recommendations. Everything he suggested was on point.
