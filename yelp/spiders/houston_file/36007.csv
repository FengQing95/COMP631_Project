Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I think the atmosphere and interior is great. I loved the exposed brick wall and everyone seems to love the room with all of the whiskey bottles. I came to Bosscat for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn't terribly busy. The dinner rush hadn't started so we grabbed spots at the bar. The drinks were good but the food wasn't anything special. It's such a great location and nice spot, I just wish the food was better.
