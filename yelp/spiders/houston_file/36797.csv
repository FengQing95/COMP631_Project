Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We were greeted and seated immediately. Someone brought out water shortly after we sat down. Soon after that, Breanne showed up and told us about her recommendations on cocktails and apps. Roomy got the 38 special. I had the Kentucky Orange Blossom. Both were delicious. Mine actually smelled so good I mentioned bottling it as perfume. For an app, we had the pulled pork hush puppies. I'm not sure they came across as hush puppies for me. They were more like a grown up version of a corn dog. But they were yummy, and the mustardy Carolina sauce is something I want stocked in my fridge. After very little deliberation, we settled on dinner. I reluctantly went with the shrimp and grits. I made the wrong choice. For me. Honestly, the only thing "wrong" was that the shrimp were a bit tough/over cooked. But for me, the dish missed the mark. I know I'm from south Louisiana, and my mark is ridiculously high. But Breanne, being the astounding server that she is, asked me to be honest, so I was. Again, not a bad dish. Just not one I cared for. Roomy got the short rib, and it was amazing. He won dinner.
