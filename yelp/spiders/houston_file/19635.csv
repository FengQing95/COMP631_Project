Uchi////Finally tried Uchi.  It opened up in our neighborhood some time ago but we just had not gotten around to it.  If you're in the mood for sushi I suggest going someplace else.  I'd describe Uchi more as a Japanese-inspired tapas.  We had some excellent dishes with interesting combinations of ingredients.  I would definitely return but I don't see Uchi as a place that I would go to when the sushi craving hits.  Their sushi is very good but it's really not their focus.
