Uchi////This place was great! Went here with my husband tonight and everything was exceptional. We got seated right away at a community table. We were greeted with in a few seconds and our waiter, Matt, was so helpful in guiding us. He asked us specifically what we enjoy eating, if we have any allergies, and if we would eat bolder fish... after answering these questions he asked if we would be open for him to choose our entire menu. We received Such a variety of fish and things that we probably would not have ordered that were exotic and delicious! We loved how the waiters and waitresses explained each dish in detail and how to eat it. What a great experience!
