Local Foods////I love this place!! It's the perfect place for lunch or dinner. Perfect for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans alike. My two faves so far are the vegan kale salad and the asian salad with tofu. Their homemade chips are also delish!! Also portion sizes and customer service are on point. They have a good sized patio and it's dog friendly too! If you're looking for a solid meal in West U/Rice village this is definitely the place!
