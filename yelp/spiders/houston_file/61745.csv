Baby Barnaby's////I went here over the weekend because my friends and I wanted to relive our college days. Baby Barnaby's is located in the heart of Montrose, and has the most delicious brunch you will EVERRRRRR have!!!! My go to are always the Green Eggs which are AMAZING!! It's basically spinach and artichoke hearts mixed with pepper jack cheese in your eggs. It comes with potatoes and chicken sausage which are so good as well. The portions here are huge, and price is so reasonable. Not like all of these bougie/overpriced Houston brunch spots.
