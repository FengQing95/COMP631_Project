Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The sweet pastry items are available @ 7 am.  I usually go right at opening time before work for a special birthday for the office or about 3 pm on Sat for a birthday party dinner. There appears to be fewer sell out of items.  Also with new ownership came later hours and celebration cakes.
