Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////However, what caught my heart was the delectable breads in the Daily Selection ($4) - the cheapest item on the breakfast menu that averages $10 per order and yet the one that may gives you the most bang for your bucks. Breads are breads to me until I tried Common Bond's, and in my accidental blind taste test when I left the leftover on the countertop too long for my friend, she also attested that they are extraordinary. Yes, I got leftover because the order came with a small baguette and five thick bread slices, and you would have to be extremely hungry to finish all that! Complementing with a nice cup of coffee, this was an excellent breakfast with ordinary items of extraordinary quality.
