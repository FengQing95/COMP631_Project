Uchi////Uchi is expensive but it is worth every penny. Service and food are top notch and never disappoints. The fact that you can taste the freshness in each bite is mind blowing. The are creative, caring and deliver best customer service. I don't mind the cost when each and every person gets treated like an mvp.
