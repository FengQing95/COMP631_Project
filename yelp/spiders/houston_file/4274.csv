JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I always see a huge crowd here and a line so I had to go. I don't know much about Ramen, but it was delicious. I got an appetizer that I didn't love, but I don't remember which one it was. The ramen was delicious! My husband and I sat at the bar to avoid the long wait and it was great. The service even at the bar was good and I recommend sitting at the bar unless you want to wait a while or have a large group.
