Uchi////MIXED FEELINGS, this was my first time and I ordered several rolls and several sashimi pieces. If your palette lacks the depth to respect different cuts and species of fish and meat then you'll be heavily disappointed to pay these high prices. So, If you're food enthusiast like me and still want to try this place: it is a must. I suggest you talk it out with your server about what you enjoy and want before order because it is easy paying for something in order to realize it's unjustified.
