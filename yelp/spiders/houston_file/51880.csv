Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my favorite brunch places! The food is just as good as it looks! We got the OMG! French Toast, the Breakfast Pot Pie, and the Ava-ca-dabra Mimosa! They all tasted sooooo good! And can we talk about that plating  i just wish the French Toast came with more strawberries, but other than that no complaints! The servers were really nice, and the food came fast too  the only thing is I would say the ambiance was ok. The diner doesn't look too special, but the service and food definitely make up for it!
