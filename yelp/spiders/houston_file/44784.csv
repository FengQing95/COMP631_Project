Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've gotten the chicken and biscuits, the smoked duck tartine and the steak and blue cheese salad. All were great choices, but my favorite is definitely the chicken and biscuits. Very crispy chicken, delicious buttery biscuit and the gravy is thick and flavorful.
