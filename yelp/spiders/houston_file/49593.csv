Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Aaron brought us the Sinful pancake as an appetizer and it was AMAZING! I got the OMG French toast with no coconut and it was super yummy! My friends got the Benny Goodman, winter harvest, and pancake of the day. They loved the first two. The winter harvest was a "light breakfast" according to her. The strawberry Bliss was a miss (in our opinion). It was a weird mixture of flavors and it wasn't nearly as good as the Sinful pancake that we started with.
