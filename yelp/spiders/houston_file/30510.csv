The Pit Room////VERY YUMMY and fun southern comfort food joint in Houston. The pulled pork and brisket tacos were amazing, and the meat was so juicy and flavorful. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was the help yourself pickled bar station, which was full of pickles, pickled onions, pickled carrots and much more! This is an amazing place to come with family and friends, as there is lots of outdoor seating with lights and a lovely patio.
