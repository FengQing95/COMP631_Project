Uchi////The sushi and seafood ranged from very good to just alright. The Ham and Eggs roll was salty and, in my boyfriend's opinion, an unsuccessful balance of flavors. The Walu Walu is delicious; my favorite dish of the night. The Hama Chili is also tasty. The oysters (ordered off of the daily specials menu) were meaty but had too many bells and whistles added to it which overwhelmed rather than complimented the freshness and flavor of the oyster itself. The fried milk dessert is to die for.
