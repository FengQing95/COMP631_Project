Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////While there is usually a line by 11am on a weekend, the line moves at a decent pace so I haven't really had to wait more than 20 min. Wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people as the space is relatively small and compact. The parking lot isn't big but majority of the time I've had good luck/timing on my side. Otherwise, it's montrose -- you may have to park a couple blocks away, but the pastries are worth it.
