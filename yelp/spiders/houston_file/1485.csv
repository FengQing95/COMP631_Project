JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is our 2nd favorite ramen place in Houston!! This place is always busy when we go, but the longest wait we've had is 15 minutes. I order the same ramen each time (Tonkotsu black) and even though the flavor varies each time, it is always delicious! The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality, but maybe a tad on the higher end compared to other ramen places.
