Local Foods////I came here for the first time this past weekend. I ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich with a side of quinoa and chips. The shrimp and crab were mixed with a mayo-type base, herbs, and seasoning. It was at cold temperature. The bread was to die for. The quinoa had a hint of sweetness which gave it a great taste. I believe the sweetness was from small amounts of pineapples.
