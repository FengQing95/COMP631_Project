Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a fantastic bakery and breakfast/lunch spot. Their pastries are always delicious (the pistachio croissant is a favorite of my husband's) and the food is consistently good to excellent. I've found the staff to be friendly, although since it's an order at the counter style restaurant, there isn't much service to speak of. But the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. The tables are very close together and it does get crowded, so sometimes it can feel a little bit like a sardine can, but such is the price of a good meal.
