Kata Robata////Working at sushi restaurant I have quite good amount of knowledge in sushi. First, service was bad. I was guided to very end corner table and maybe cuz of that my server barely came to my table. He didnt even ask how the food is. The worst part of service was when I asked for fresh wasabi. Without informing me, I was charged for 7 dollars for about my thumb size amount of fresh wasabi. It would have been OK only if he informed me before charging 7 dollars for that little thing. I ordered bunch of sushi and a ramen. It took almost 30mins to get the sushi and about 45mins for the ramen. It was slow and the taste was nothing special for that amount of time. But, I can definitely say Anago is good there. Overall food was ok but service was 3 out of 10.
