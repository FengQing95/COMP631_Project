Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I finally got to go to the bakery, now that it is not impossible to get in lol. I ordered a cake for my husband's Â birthday, the double chocolate. I went to pick it up, and I was excited to see other little treats that have to offer. Everything looked so good, especially the chocolate chip cookies, even though I was fasting, I was able to resist temptation, after we had a amazing cake to look forward to. I will need to return for those cookies, and the menu looks so delicious, I want to try everything, As for our cake, you can really tell the difference when quality ingredients are used. It was so good, it tasted like a hostess cupcake.
