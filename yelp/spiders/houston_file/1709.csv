JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Friend and I came for a lunch on a Sunday. Not sure what she ordered, but she got a combo w/a salad and a rice/curry plate. We had a plate of fries w/truffle ketchup (yum), edamame (yum) for the table. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen - delicious. Definitely recommend and will return.
