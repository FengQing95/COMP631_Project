Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Rustyn was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! He makes a awesome drink and knows his menu. It was my first time there and my mother and I fell in love. It was my birthday and they gave me this great brownie with this homemade whipped cream which was amazing. He made me a boss lady and my mom a specialty drink that has no name from fresh fruit. The fries are really good and different than any other restaurant I have been too. My mom had the pork chop sandwich and I had the BC sandwich. Both were good but we loved the pork chop sandwich. The one thing that really stood out for me however was a sign in the bathroom about dating and being able to discreetly ask for help if you are on an uncomfortable date. You get major kudos for allowing women to have that option and it is important that everyone feels safe. My experience is how all businesses should operate! You need to teach a class to these other business. This is must check out restaurant even if it is just for happy hour. And if you you are there early enough ask for Rustyn!
