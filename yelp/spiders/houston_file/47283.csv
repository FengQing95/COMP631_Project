Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I loveee breakfast food so I had too try this place out. I just got something basic eggs,hasbrowns,and pancakes. I ordered an extra pancake but the waiter  didn't tell me how huge the cakes were so I only ate 1 :/  but the pancakes were sooo good and the mimosa I had was refreshing. Next time I will try a different mix. My friend has the breakfast tacos and he was in love with them and the sauce the waiter recommended. Overall the food was good. Will be back.
