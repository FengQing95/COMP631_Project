Uchi////-Brie ringo - This is the dish that made me fall in love with Uchi in Austin. It's just so perfectly composed. You get 4 bites of (bottom to top) sweet potato chip, brie that's been tempura fried so it's crispy on the outside and hot and gooey on the inside, apple chutney on top. It's a dish of juxtapositions: sweet/salty, crispy/gooey, buttery/tart.
