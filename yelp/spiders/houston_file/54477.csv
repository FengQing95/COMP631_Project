Kata Robata////This place was busy for 7PM on a Wednesday. We still had to wait 30 minuets for a 2-top. We ordered a la carte nigiri. The size, temperature, and quality of the fish were great! ....but that still only accounts for the smaller portion of the nigiri piece. The rice I was served with my nigiri pieces were too dense. It was not soft to the bite, and the temperature was a bit cool, versus being warm. The rest of the experience was great. I like my dining experience here better than MF Sushi, but not more than Uchi. When you're spending a good chunk of change at these restaurants, you want a good dining experience, not just for food. I'd give this place a solid 4.
