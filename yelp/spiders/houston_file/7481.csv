JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nazia - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, and had such nice things to say! And I'm also quite pleased our staff was attentive and helpful. Thank you for your suggestion, as well. As a franchise, we are somewhat beholden to the R&D department of our corporate headquarters; they devise our new recipes that we introduce each month. Hopefully in the future we will have something akin to a seafood-style ramen!
