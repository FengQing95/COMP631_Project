The Pit Room////Found this place on google maps after leaving the museum district. It was pretty crowded so i figured it must be good lol! Service moved pretty fast and the food was good. I had the brisket and pork ribs. The sides i had was the elote fully dressed and the cole slaw. Slaw cld use more seasoning i wasn't a fan but everything else was really good.
