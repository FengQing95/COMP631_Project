Uchi////Hands down, the best sushi I've ever had. I highly recommend doing the chefs tasting. You get to try so many amazing dishes! The best time to go is during happy hour and to get a bunch of small portion items so you get to try more. Also, the service here is impeccable. Everyone is SO knowledgeable and helpful!
