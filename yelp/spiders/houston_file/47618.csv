Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The hot chocolate was really good; it had a very distinct flavor to it that I couldn't quite place, maybe nutmeg, which I don't usually like. The in-house made whipped cream was delicious. If I were to ever come back to this place, it would only be to get a hot chocolate to go. Also, the staff were pleasant.
