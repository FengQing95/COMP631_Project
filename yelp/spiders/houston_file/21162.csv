Uchi////- food! Folks... You likely have never had these types of flavors and textures before... I assure you. The chef is highly HIGHLY skilled and acclaimed. This is magic. Again... NOT hype. I had the waitress pick all my food BOTH nights (I came two nights in a row instead of the steak house I was going to visit) and wow. WOW!
