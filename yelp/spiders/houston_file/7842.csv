JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Brandon - Thank you for your review. We're never going to be all things to all people, but we do take customer satisfaction seriously. Please know that you can always inform your server if you're not 100% satisfied with any of our food for any reason. He or she will gladly offer something else that might suit your palate, replace the item or remove it from your tab. We offer a variety of ramens at JINYA, and we have found that certain ramen combinations suit people very differently. There's definitely no one-size-fits-all. Regardless, we appreciate your visit.
