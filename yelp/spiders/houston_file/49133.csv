Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The place doesn't have an hour wait because the food is bad. This is a great place but is it worth the wait? Is anything worth an hour wait? I mean, I've waited this long for Game of Thrones final season so I guess I can wait for pancakes. The place is cool, good service, good variety and good food. Like the Fonz and Rachel Ray got together to open a restaurant.
