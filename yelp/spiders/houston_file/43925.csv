Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here on a Sunday around 1pm. The wait was around 15 minutes to order and then maybe another 15 minutes to receive our food. However we did get our almond croissant and raspberry pistachio tart immediately so that kept us happy while waiting for the rest of our food. It had the decor of a really cute bakery with lots of white and glass. They have a little patio area to sit outside on a nice day too
