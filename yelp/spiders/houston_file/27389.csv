The Pit Room////Visiting some friends in Houston and this was the first stop that they took us to eat. We went to the Pit Room for lunch! Boy! I'm glad they brought us here. It was delicious. I'm not a big fan of okra, but their okra is delicious and full of flavor...I definitely wish I had some right now. Their sausage and brisket were amazing, great BBQ. I understand why the door is outside of the door, but they get the line moving pretty quickly.
