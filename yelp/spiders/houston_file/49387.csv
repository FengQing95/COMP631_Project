Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ate here last Saturday. We waited over an hour to be seated. From the time we were seated, it took an additional hour to receive our food. That's two hours to get food. The food is decent, but the long wait time unfortunately makes this an establishment I won't come back to. I can get a large home cooked breakfast at House of Pies in our Galleria neighborhood that's comparable to this place, but at about $2-$5 less per plate, and less wait time. Was nice to try once- the indoor decor was definitely cool.
