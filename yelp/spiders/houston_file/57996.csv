Kata Robata////Woah! Wow! Wa wa wee wa! Hands down the best sushi I've had in Houston!! My faves were the salmon, fatty tuna, eel, and scallop nigris. Such high quality fish! Loved loved the wagyu katsu sando and the lobster Mac and cheese! Â Overall, everything was damn good! Service was outstanding! Prices were hella high haha
