Local Foods////Decor is "yuppies meet hipster" with polished concrete, high industrial ceilings, and a melange of chairs and tables that looked like it was all shipped from the West Elm catalog.  Cool, pretty, and upscale without being stuffy is a good summation:  you could bring your Grandma here and she'd be comfy.  She may even pull up a chair with some porkpie-hat jhort-wearing types.  (Several were seen during my visit.)
