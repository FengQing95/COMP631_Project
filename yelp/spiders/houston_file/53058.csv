Kata Robata////Beyond impressed with the costumer service and the food. I went this past Sunday for the first time with little info but referred by many of my friends. I went with my husband and son who is 1. It's hard as heck to eat at any restaurant with a child less than 4 years of age. Luckily I came when it was happy hour. I was already blessed that Sunday. Amen. ANYWAYS. Im really here to write a review about Matt The Server. He was accommodating to my son's needs. (My son doesn't eat seafood yet and its super hard to find a meal for him at a sushi restaurant) Matt recommended some entrees and appetizers that best suited my little one and when I ordered milk for my son, Matt kindly took my son's sippy cup and DISINFECTED IT and asked if I would like his milk warm or cold. I will always come to this restaurant mainly for Matt. He was amazing and def made my family's experience at Kata Robata so perfect.
