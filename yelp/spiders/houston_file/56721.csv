Kata Robata////Came for another unforgettable Omakase experience and was not disappointed. Chef really outdid himself. Dining at Kata Robata is my favorite date night. The staff are all warm and welcoming, the chefs are top notch, the food is excellent and unique, the atmosphere is fun and inviting... everything at Kata is 5 stars without being snobby and uncomfortable. Not to mention the food is just mouthwatering delicious. Life changing sushi! Kata has ruined me for other sushi places, they have set the bar so high!
