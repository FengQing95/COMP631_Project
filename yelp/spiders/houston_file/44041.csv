Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So much natural lighting! Much love! Such sunlight! Radiance! Upon entering, they have a creative display of their own to-go boxes lined up opposite from ceramic milk bottles. Overall, a great feeling of cleanliness and refreshing atmosphere. A few of the baristas were kinda cute too, hahaha.
