Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Amazing!!!! I've been to snooze only twice and the first time was in the woodlands area but this location was perfect besides the wait which was about 1.5 hr it was sure worth the wait. I tried the shrimp and grits which were on point, great flavor and I didn't even have to add any salt & pepper. I also ordered the pineapple upside down pancakes which I've had before and they were out of this world; something I cannot even describe I can eat those everyday. I never order alcoholic beverages here but I was tempted and it was a celebration so my friend and I ordered the lavender & regular mimosa and the lavender one was perfect and was better than any drink I've tasted before; I should have ordered two instead of getting the pineapple mimosa. The drinks had the perfect amount of alcohol in it.
