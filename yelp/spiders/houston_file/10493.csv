JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We ordered desserts too. We got the green tea and chocolate mochi balls, but I fucking hate mochi balls. I always think if I try it again I'll like it, but I don't. If you never had them, it taste like dough that's not cooked.. it's so hard to chew and you're literally chewing for-fucking-ever.
