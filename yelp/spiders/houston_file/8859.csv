JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have always sat at the bar, here. They are always busy, but our service was pretty quick! We had the spicy chicken ramen. Not too spicy, but a nice kick. I would consider it a more casual place, as I usually have dined with friends. The atmosphere is a bit too busy and not intimate enough to be a date night go-to.
