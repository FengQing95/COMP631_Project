JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Umami noodles were our favorite, the flavor was right on spot. Chicken spicy noodle was pretty delicious as well. But the cherry on top of the cake was the bunssss! Pork was so juicy and flavorful like no other i have ever tried; i died and went back to heaven. I must warn you they are highly caloric, but for that flavor I will risk a coronary!
