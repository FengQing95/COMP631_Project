Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My family and I started out with a version of the avocado toast and the totchos. Avocado toast never disappoints (even thought it's definitely never worth the price eating it at a restaurant, ever) but the totchos were on another level. The tater tots were still perfectly crisp and fluffy despite being smothered in a delicious cheese/chorizo/flavor bomb sauce.
