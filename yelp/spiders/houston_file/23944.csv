Uchi////First off, get reservations. Uchi is one of those establishments where every night is potentially booked up. While there is plenty of group seating, I highly recommend coming in smaller groups (no more than 4) to really enjoy their small plates without having to double up on items. Sitting at the bar in front of the sushi chefs is an ideal experience for all omakase / sushi lovers.
