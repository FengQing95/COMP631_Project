Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been here on several occasions, mainly for a glass of wine or two. I was always sitting at the bar. You may want to take a break and visit if you're already in the area - it is not entirely in walking distance from either "Highland Village" or "River Oaks District". There is almost no public parking available, they have valet though.
