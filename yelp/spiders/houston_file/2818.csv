JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Katie - Thank you very much for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our Tonkotsu broth. This is our staple pork broth that we use for a variety of ramen bowls. We hope you can visit us again to single out your favorite, and perhaps try some other bowls, as well ;-D. Thanks again, and we appreciate your kind words and patronage greatly.
