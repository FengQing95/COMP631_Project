Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ridiculously good.  Went for the first time and had the corned beef hash and a sinful cinnamon roll pancake. Loved the hash and don't usually eat pancakes but decided to try them since it was my first time.  The pancake was unbelievably good.  I am definitely returning to try the rest of the menu.  Staff and customers were great as well.
