Uchi////I've been to Uchi about 5x now and I can now say it's one of my favorite places to come when celebrating an occasion. Service is spectacular from start to finish. The staff are all very friendly and professional. On my most recent visit, I was celebrating my birthday and they gave us a complimentary off-menu appetizer. What an awesome way to start off my dinner!
