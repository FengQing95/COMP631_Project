Kata Robata////My husband brought me for lunch and he highly recommended their Kobe style Texas skewers. First I was suspicious about the 2 average looking skewers (3 meat cubes on each skewer) that cost $17. But my opinion immediately changed as soon as I put the meat in my mouth - it melts in your mouth and tastes like heaven! Among all the food we ordered, the skewers are the best. I also like their steamed egg custard w/foie gras. Ramen, sushi, grilled whole squid are OK, but not impressive. We had green tea souffl√© cake for dessert, it doesn't have much green tea flavor as I wished but the light texture and low sugar level made my taste buds happy.
