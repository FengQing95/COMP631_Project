Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking sucks, wait is long 30-45 minuets, but parking down the street, and the long wait is worth it. Service is excellent, our server was very attentive, asking to top off our coffees, and kept checking in on us. The food was amazing as always, I had the Quinoa Breakfast Bowl, very good for someone trying to eat light. Everyone else enjoyed their breakfast as well.
