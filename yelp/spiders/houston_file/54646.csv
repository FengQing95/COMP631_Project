Kata Robata////Secondly, the rice seems to be cooked by someone that is unfamiliar with Japanese rice making. The first time I ordered a simple Katsudon and the rice was not cooked through. Each piece of rice still had a hard kernel inside. The next time I ordered a rice dish, I had it in roll format. The rice was overcooked and was completely mushy. The roll could barely keep its shape. I've noticed that they are not very good when it comes to the more traditional Japanese recipes.
