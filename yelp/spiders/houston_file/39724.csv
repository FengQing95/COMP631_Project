Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to this bar with friends and no one really liked their food. The meats were very delicious but everything else wasn't good. I got the pulled pork and coleslaw sandwich, the pork was well made, but the bun and claw was super dry, honestly making me not eat the burger and take it to go. The mushroom fries and flat breads were delicious!! My friend got the meatloaf and it was good, but the Mac and cheese was cold. The fries were burnt to inedible and the drinks were tasty but not very strong for the price. We spent way too much money to not love our food.
