Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's good, if you can find a place to park. Breads, breakfast & salads are great, but all over sized (over priced) for single serving.  Do try if you are into the coffee scene.  Attractive atmosphere and people.... though it is so very loud to hear friends or concentrate if you are working on computer. Parents very comfortable allowing their young children to be noisey. It would be better if they sat on patio. I now only stop to pick up fresh bread and bring it home.
