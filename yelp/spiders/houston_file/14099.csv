JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since opening our Midtown location four years ago, we have NEVER dealt with a staff member who committed any such acts, and I want to assure you any infractions of this nature would be dealt with harshly. We accept the fact that our servers may miss the mark, and we do everything in our power to keep our standards high. For example, we hire a "Secret Shopper" program that randomly tests our staff in terms of compliance and overall service.
