Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yay! The Heights location is open. I came yesterday for lunch (tomato ricotta flatbread) and today for breakfast (soft scrambled eggs). Both were delicious. My husband gobbled up his french toast. Most importantly the atmosphere is open and chill. I can't wait to try baked goods but mostly I see having a new neighborhood go to spot.
