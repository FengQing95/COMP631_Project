Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////- Expect the wait to be anywhere from 45 min to an hour if they're already open and the line is starting to wrap along westheimer--there's another wrapping line inside. And everyone takes an eternity to order; almost reminiscent of Dominique Ansel's cronut wait in NYC. Can't fault them for living up to the hype so we cannot blame them for the line, but wish the ordering process is more efficient.
