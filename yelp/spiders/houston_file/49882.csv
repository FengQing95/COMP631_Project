Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'll say up front that I'm a bit of a foodie.  That said, we were on vacation (from the Chicago suburbs) and passing through Houston.  After sticking our heads inside of, and then fleeing two other breakfast eateries, we drove another 20 minutes to get to Snooze.  Based on the reviews and the hip vibe, we were expecting, "wow!"  Our server was helpful, but very rushed.  The food was OK, but nothing to write home about.  Other than the trendy space, this is Denny's or Cracker Barrel food.
