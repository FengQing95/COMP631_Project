Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent place to have a mellow dinner. Victor and Omar made great recommendations on food and drinks. Selected old fashion and pineapple elixer. Both are very good. Then picked out the meatballs. Plate arrived sauce. Try sauce first before dipping your meatballs. I really like it but it's not for everyone. The meatballs are crispy on the outside and moist in the middle. Larger crowd arrives during happy. Plenty of seating for large crowds. There is also couple seating. DJ played slow jams and some faster melodies. If you need outlets, there are some near door. Dont forget to ask for Victor or Omar, both are awesome. There is also rent a private for your whiskey tour. Great for wedding dinner rehearsals or college events.
