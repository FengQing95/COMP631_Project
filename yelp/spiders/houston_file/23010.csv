Uchi////My first review and my mind is completely blown with this place. I am in Love! There was complimentary valet parking. NICE! Â So my gf made online reservation a week before. While we waited for a table we got to sample tempura hanna (fried cauliflower) it was appetizing! Yum! We waited 10mins and couldn't wait any longer. So a spot opened up on the bar. We took it right away. We got to sit in front of the sushi chef. Our chef that night was Chef Howard. He was so awesome!
