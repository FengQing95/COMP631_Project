JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I did not like their menma (bamboo shoots). So far, all of the ramen restaurants I've tried, have very seasoned, flavorful, thinly cut bamboo shoots. This place literally had sliced thick slices of menma and had no additional flavor to it. It was very hard to eat and they gave me a pretty generous ration but I only eat half a slice. They were also generous with the side of corn but you cant really go wrong with corn lol.
