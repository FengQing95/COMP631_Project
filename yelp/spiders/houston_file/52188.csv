Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I can'r believe i lived in Midtown for years and never stopped by Snooze to catch some brunch. Better late then never. The wait time is pretty lengthy on a saturday but It was worth it. My Server GABRIEL was amazing. He made all the right recommendations on the food and gave me water and asked if I needed ketchup salt pepper or hot sauce without me asking him for it. Big plus. Not that many servers take pride in working so it's nice to get michelin star like service and a local brunch staple.
