Kata Robata////My fianc√© and I decided to stop here since we were in the mood for sushi. There was a 30 minute wait unless we sat at the sushi bar. Well, I've never sat at a sushi bar so I agreed and it was great! The sushi guys were very friendly and nice. Our server, Andrew, was very personable and helpful. The food was AMAZING! I have tried a good amount of different types of sushi and that was literally the best sushi I have ever had. The flavor was so perfect. We also ordered the Kata ramen and it couldn't have been better! I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know and next time I'm bringing friends!!
