Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A nice touch to the restaurant is that they use real candles at the table. The decor is nice, the whiskey room is an awesome sight to see, and there is nice outdoor seating. The owners are very nice and I'm very honored to have met them. We'll definitely be back here in the future!!
