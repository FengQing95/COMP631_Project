Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also ordered an iced mocha which he asked me if I had a preference for almond or soy milk, but failed to mention the extra 75 cent charge until I saw it on my receipt. Ordered my drink early too and didn't even get it until after I got my food. Someone else actually brought the drink after I asked them about it after receiving my food. Apparently he didn't even enter in my drink order because the first drink they brought to me was a hot coffee with creamer...I had to correct the drink order with the food runner who finally gave me my actual drink order after another 5 minutes.
