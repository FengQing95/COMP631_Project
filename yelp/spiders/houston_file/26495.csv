The Pit Room////Service: The line was not a wait at all! The meat guys were very fast and efficient in getting all the orders out in a fast manner. There was also a man who kept checking in on my friend and I while we were eating. He was also very observant since he noticed we had stopped eating, came over and asked if we needed boxes and made small talk with us. The service here is very friendly!
