Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We began with the Breakfast in Bed shot ,the smooth bourbon you could taste the hint of maple syrup, in house cured bacon chased with orange juice- simply can't start brunch without this! Of course what would brunch be without mimosas?! It's fun to have the fruit juices on the side, like enjoying a new mimosa each time!
