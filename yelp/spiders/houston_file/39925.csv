Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great mixed drinks and food here. I went here for a company happy hour and really enjoyed the drinks here. We ordered lots of items off the appetizer menu and they were absolutely great pairing for the best happy hour I've ever been to and not your typical bar food. One of the surprising eats on the appetizers that I enjoyed were the madeleines, just the right amount of crunch on the outside with fluffy inside.
