Kata Robata////The food here is absolutely magnificent, and I everything is an absolute treat to the palate. I had the absolute honor of being waited on by Katie, who is the crown jewel of this restaurant. She was kind, attentive, had the kindest of things to say about absolutely everything on the menu, and was the perfect representation for this establishment. If you have the fortunate experience of dining here and having her as your Hostess, you're going to have the most perfect of evening. She is absolutely deserving of a raise and a promotion. A+
