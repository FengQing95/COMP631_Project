JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since I've been in Houston, this is one of my top favorite ramen spots to go to. My husband and I came with a friend of ours to this spot two months ago and we enjoyed our time here. I had ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen and my husband ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen. The bowls they came in were pretty steep so there was more ramen than broth (which I'm okay with because I love the noodles).
