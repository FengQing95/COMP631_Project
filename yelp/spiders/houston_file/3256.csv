JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great as always! I get the chicken wonton with garlic and a seasoned egg and the boyfriend gets the tonkatsu black with chili oil. Always delicious and fresh! We also love the creamy shorn tempura. Big shrimp with a delicious creamy sauce on top. A great introduction to an amazing meal. Will always come back and is a definite favorite of ours.
