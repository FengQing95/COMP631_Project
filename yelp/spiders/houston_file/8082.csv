JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This restaurant definitely lived up to its reputation. The ambience, food, and service were all so great. Honestly the only complain I have was the wait, but the food definitely made it all worth it. When we visited, we got the takuyaki and I legit almost cried. It was to the point where we left and went on the rest of the day and I was still thinking about it. I was also really content with my ramen of choice, the cha cha cha. Ugh, it was so good. The only thing was that it has thick noodles and be mindful of that. For a small girl like me, I couldn't finish the bowl because the noodles were super filling and heavy on your stomach. But the broth was super good.
