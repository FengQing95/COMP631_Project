Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I preferred the fruity pebbles French Toast and my friend tried to order The King but it was sold out. Â so we both got the same thing with the Bosscat fries. When I tell you that French toast was amazing, I am not lying! I tried to eat it all!!! The fries were pretty good as well. They make their own catsup (ketchup) that goes with it and it was good! We literally stayed till they closed and made new friends!
