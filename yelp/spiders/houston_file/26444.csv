The Pit Room////This place I had high hopes for... But no bake potatoes or french fries??? I came here with a chopped beef bake potatoe in mind... no bueno... So I opted for a chopped beef sandwich with a side of fries... no bueno... So the next best thing was the Frito pie with Â chopped beef... no bueno... Dry and flavorless was the verdict... Large portion enough for two... But very disappointed in the taste... All presented well to the eye but not to the taste buds... I give this place 3 stars because it sure looks good and you would think you are in for something great... no bueno...
