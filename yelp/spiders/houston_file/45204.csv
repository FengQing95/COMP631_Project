Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////People complain the quality has gone downhill since they were bought by Carino's a few years ago, and those people are dead wrong. This place has only gotten better since the menu and hours were updated. Do yourself a favor and get a lavender latte and a kouign amann pastry. Brownies are weirdly a little bitter but cookies and pastries are on point. I have had the truffle fries (excellent), various sandwiches (ham and cheese on a croissant is a transcendent experience) and the salads are all delicious too. A must and definitely worth the wait.
