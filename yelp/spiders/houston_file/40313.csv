Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////OMG! BETTER than expectations!! I had bookmarked Bosscat before leaving San Diego to get a stiff drank while in Houston. Ava, Dan & Octavio really took care of us. We were sat at a high top immediately upon walking in even though I wanted bar, hubby's choice. Ava told us about happy hour and we were so stoked! When the bar cleared out we moved to the bar and Octavio & Dan really took care of us! Octavio made me a BRONAR exactly how I had asked for & Dan hooked us up with wedding cake shots because  we were celebrating our wedding anniversary while in Houston. I LOVE BOSSCAT SO  MUCH, how do I become an investor??? Open one in San Diego PLEASE
