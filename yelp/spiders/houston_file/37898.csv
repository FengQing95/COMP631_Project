Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This a nice place to eat and the vibes are good. My friend and I recently visited and we were pleased. We ordered the tater tots with chorizo, jalape√±os, cheese, and a poached egg. I forgot what that particular dish was called but it was great. We both got full off of it, so the portion sizes are great! You definitely get what you pay for. Will be returning.
