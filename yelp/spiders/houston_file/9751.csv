JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Can be hard to get a table as this place is very popular.  I believe it's because of the decent menu selection at a reasonable price point.  That being said, I don't love the flavor base of their ramen.  I can't explain fully, but It somehow comes off as bland, despite the many ingredients.
