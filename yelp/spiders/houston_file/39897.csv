Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place had a great atmosphere and if you enjoy whiskey I believe this would be a great experience for you. The food was really good but for me the star was the poutine. The rest of the table really enjoyed the hot chicken dip but the flavor had a heavy mayo taste that wasn't for me. The brick chicken was crispy and extremely flavorful with a tasty rice that was all around delicious. Our waiter was extremely patient with all of our questions about foods and drinks so it was definitely 5 stars on service.
