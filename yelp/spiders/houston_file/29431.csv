The Pit Room////The truly excellent: the pork ribs, the beans, and above all the brisket. The first was tender and smoky, the second had amazing seasoning, and the last was one of the better briskets I've ever had. They gave him a fatty end of it, which I usually don't like, but the fat was well-distributed and made for perfect moist bites.
