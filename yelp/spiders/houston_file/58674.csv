Baby Barnaby's////This was my first time going to baby Barnabys, and I was impressed. The place is small and cozy, so small that they only had 2 waitresses, but they were friendly and efficient. The food was simply awesome. I had the steak and eggs and I must say, the best I ever had. Â The steak was marinated, and tasted like it was griiled on a smoke pit. Speaking of smoke they also served smoked bacon which was also delicious (I always try the bacon at every restaurant I go). And don't let me forget about the freshly squeezed orange juice they serve and when I say fresh, I mean they go and squeeze you a glass when you order it. All in all this is one of the best breakfast places in town, but don't take my word for it, check it out yourself ....they close at 2.
