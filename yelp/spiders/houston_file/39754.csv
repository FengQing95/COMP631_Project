Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Read so many great reviews I decided to bring my husband here for his birthday, when we arrived we were told our reservation was timed- understandable probably due to COVID. Our waiter came to get our drink order and took about 30 minutes to bring our drinks out. Maybe we will try next time? Not sure what happened.
