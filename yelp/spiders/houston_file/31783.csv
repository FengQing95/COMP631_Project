Local Foods////Thanks to all the reviews, I tried the crunchy chicken sandwich and it's so good! The pretzel roll does make the sandwich. I had chips and the cucumber as sides and they were pretty tasty. My friend got the roast beef which looked huge! I enjoyed the mint-aide as well, very refreshing.
