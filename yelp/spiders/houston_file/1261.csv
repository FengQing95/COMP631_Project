JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I regret that we did not meet your standards for food or service, but I feel it is very necessary to clarify a few of the points you made in your review. I respect and understand your feelings towards our establishment, but I would still like to invite you to come back and give us another chance, however unlikely that might be. And if you decide to return, please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Raul, Wynne or Sara), who will make sure everything is done to offer you a vastly superior dining experience.
