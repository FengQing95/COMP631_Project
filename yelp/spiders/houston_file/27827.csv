The Pit Room////Oh man, this is the first place that has made me not want to drive to Lockhart for my bbq! The pulled pork and fatty brisket are to.die.for, and the elotes are on point. You don't need the bbq sauce, indeed, despite being delicious in ever way, the meat is so perfectly moist you don't want the bbq sauce. Just dip your bread in it.
