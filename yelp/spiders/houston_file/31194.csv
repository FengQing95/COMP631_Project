Local Foods////hm.. underwhelmed... the duck confit sandwich is good but not great.  the egg salad and crunchy chicken sandwiches were also ok.  maybe i've been spoiled by sf/bay area sandwiches?  little lucca, ike's, mr pickle, leonardo's in millbrae, cafe bunn mi in sf for vietnamese sandwiches.. now those are some good sandwiches :)
