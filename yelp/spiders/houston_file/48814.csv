Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is by far one of the best brunch places in Houston! When my parents visit from out of town this is always first on their to-do list. The food is wonderful and the prices are great. If you're feeling boozy I'd recommend the bloody mary and if you're in the mood for a coffee they have great flavored lattes and cappuccinos.
