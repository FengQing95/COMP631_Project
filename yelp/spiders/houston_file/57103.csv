Kata Robata////Kata isn't my favorite sushi restaurant in Houston in terms of quality, but it's definitely a nice plate to get dinner for special occasions. Their menu has a wide range of sushi, ramen, hot dishes, cold dishes, sushi rolls, omakase offerings, and good/boozy drinks. I highly recommend getting reservations bc there is always a wait and they are a very busy restaurant.
