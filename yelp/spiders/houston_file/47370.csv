Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place has great food, very fresh ingredients, and lots of options. Â Shrimp and grits and pineapple upside down pancakes were really good! Plain pancake, chai latte were just ok. They can have up to 2 hr waits (we only had a 30 min wait when we went) so plan accordingly. Worth going back though.
