JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my absolute favorite ramen.  I always get Tonkatsu Black, and it is delicious!  The 3 stars are due to the fact that my daughter became sick immediately after we ate here- twice! I don't know the cause, but please fix it, Jinya!  We love your ramen, but sickness, not so much.
