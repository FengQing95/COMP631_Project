Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I split two brunch plates with a friend, the Chicken Biscuit and the Boudin Eggs Benedict. We also had a chocolate croissant and coffee. All of it looked delish, but the main plates sucked. Chicken was dry. The fried breading was nasty. I ate around it. I mean who eats around the fried part of a fried chicken. The meat was dark. Not breast. The béchamel was sparse and kinda flavorless. And I've had better biscuits at chain restaurants. The boudin was fair  I would never eat either one again.
