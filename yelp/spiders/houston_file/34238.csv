Local Foods////I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich.  Omg, so good!! Shared some with Mimi (my shih tzu), she definately approves! My bf had their roast beef sandwich. They are generous with their meat! Their sandwiches come with a choice of two sides or soup. I had the olive salad and quinoa, yum! My bf had the one of their soups.  Definately will return to try their other selections! !
