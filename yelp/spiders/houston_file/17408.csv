Uchi////jar jar duck (2/5)- duck, kumquat, endive, smoked in rosemary. hmm.. okay, maybe mine was just a fluke but i was verrry disappointed. This dish comes in a jar and upon opening, there is a cloud of smoke. after the oohing and aahing the smell really got to me. it was too herby.. my olfactory receptors were becoming desensitized! okay, now on to the taste... there were maybe 4 or 5 pieces of duck, which were incredibly dry. they seemed on the verge of becoming duck jerky if they had been smoked any longer. I had one bite and forced my bf to finish the rest.
