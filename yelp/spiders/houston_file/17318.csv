Uchi////I will start with the ambiance, which, for me, is a key element to the overall magic of the dining-out experience. With the same cozy, amber lighting and cherry blossom wallpaper, it has the same special feel as the original Austin restaurant on South Lamar. The exposed wood elements and unfinished ceiling/ pipes add a modern touch to the cozy feel of the restaurant, adding an air of drama and excitement.
