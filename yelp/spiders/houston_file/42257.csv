Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every once in a while something comes along that's so good you feel compelled to challenge your vocabulary and come up with a better adjective to describe it than just your garden variety "awesome" or "amazing". Common Bond is that phenomenon. Everything from the decor, the ambiance, the attention to detail (even their napkins are beautiful), the service, and of course, the food, can only be described as exquisite. I was smitten from the minute I saw its future offerings on the facebook page before it had opened.
