Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here wanting to try something new and wow was this great. This place offers a variety of entrees with a twist to them, but it makes it taste so much better, the ambience of the place was awesome, the music wasn't too soft or too loud, the service was impeccable, Terry was funny and took care of us. 10/10 I'm definitely coming back here regularly.
