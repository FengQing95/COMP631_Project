Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Madam'croque? - I'm sure I didn't spell it right but it was like a monte cristo sandwich basically with a side of salad I guess. This was..... disgusting... the guy recommended this to me and I thought it was all good. But the side salad didn not even go good with the sandwich, it was bland, cold, and overalls just ugh. I didn't enjoy it. Was not worth the 14$...
