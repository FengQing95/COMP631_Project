JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Daniel - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your ramen. With all due respect, we are not accustomed to hearing that our ramen is "super bland," so I'm prone to think our chefs may have accidentally omitted some specific pre-base ingredients. Our chefs prepare hundreds of bowls every day, statistically speaking they will make a mistake from time to time.
