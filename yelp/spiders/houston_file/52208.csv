Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Worth the wait and get on the waitlist, we had a great waiter, loved how they where able to make out pancakes and French toast gluten free, we had so much food and the prices are great, makensure you try the strawberry shortcake margarita not sure if that's the right name but man it was good. My favorite pancakes was the sweet potato and then the blueberries Danish. Food came out fresh and hot I can see why this chain is so popular down here!
