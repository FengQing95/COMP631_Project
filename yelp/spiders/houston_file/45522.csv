Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lord have mercy I'm so full . My Texas club sandwich hit every spot literally . I'm Extra satisfied.  Came for lunch pretty packed but not to extreme . They have a lot of deserts and breads for your sweet tooth lovers . I personally had no room for any thing sweet cause my sandwich did enough . The soup was good . I had the tomato  basil soup with croutons . High recommend soup and all .
