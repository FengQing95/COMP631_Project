JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We went to this place around 8 PM on a weekday and it was packed! I was surprised. I don't think there was an empty table available for walk-in. They have a bar right in front that you see when you first walk in the restaurant but past that there are tables and booths. Ladies, despite this place being semi-romantic-ish, I definitely wouldn't suggest wearing a cocktail dress. But anything from a shirt and jeans, blouse and heels, to a summer dress and sandals should suffice. Guys, if you have a first date and want to impress her I probably wouldn't take her here. Not because the food isn't good, but more because it is a bit noisy. How can you get to know her if you can barely hear her?Â
