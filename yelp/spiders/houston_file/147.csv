JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This restaurant is hit or miss.  The product served is decent for a quick fix, but poor service tarnishes even the finest meals.  The staff seem otherwise preoccupied and unable to adapt to modifications on the menu.  I was told to order in a specific way, a particular dish that more often than not gets botched.  It seems as if a language or culture barrier exists.  What is more unnerving is that the "manager" who works behind the bar whose name I will omit, claims that ordering a dish recommended by one of the servers is too complicated for their capacity and as a result according to her and upper management,  are unable to handle my telephone order.  They have no problem however processing my debit card interestingly enough.  What's more, is that when I tried speaking to this  bar "manager", she insinuated that my intention was to get a free 13 dollar bowl of soup!  Wow, not to sound like an elitist but really??!  I believe in value for value.  I do not ask for that which I do not work for.  Simply provide the service and product, and you will not end up on Yelp with a poor review.  This is Houston, and there are countless ramen spots.  Get your game up!
