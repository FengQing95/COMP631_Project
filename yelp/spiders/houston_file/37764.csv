Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The atmosphere was nice but too loud. The food was ok not that great and overpriced. Our waiter was amazing and it was unfortunatelyhot and packed inside. We did not like the tall and hard bar stools. Â I would like to give this establishment another try, maybe they were having a bad day.
