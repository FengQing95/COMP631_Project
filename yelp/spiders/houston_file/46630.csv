Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The space is beautiful however a little small for the number of clientele this spot pulls. Still it is a nice well lit clean comfortable space to have a quick lunch or snack with a friend. Many many conversations are had over coffee and desserts on tables next to mine.
