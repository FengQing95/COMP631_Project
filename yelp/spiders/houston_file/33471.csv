Local Foods////When I was first told about this place, my friend had told me to try the truffled egg salad sandwich. I thought to myself... wow gag.. so not into that. Boy was I proven wrong! It is just about the yummiest sandwich ever! I swear everything in this place is just delicious. The only sandwich I'm not too keen for is the gulf coast shrimp and crab. It is a little too seafoody tasting to me. The sides that come with the sandwiches are just about to die for as well. My favorite is the quinoa and the cole slaw. I love how the cole slaw has edamame beans and I think pieces of thin seaweed.
