Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First time to visit.  In my neighborhood and a 5 start Yelp review.  Yes, my fellow reviewers, I trusted your reviews and you did not lead me astray.  We went on Presidents Day...and it was packed.  It was a 20 minute wait...but worth it.  Coffee was available outside under the umbrellas. Service was swift and pleasant.  Even though the kitchen was slammed, the food arrived perfectly and was delicious!  We will be back.  The perfect food and vib for The Heights!
