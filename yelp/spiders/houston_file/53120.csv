Kata Robata////terrible service. was told my table was getting ready and ended up waiting 30 minutes. quality of rice and fish is subpar. kata once upon a time used to be a hot spot destination but i'd say MF SUSHI is much better. the value isn't there for the prices and in this range many other options
