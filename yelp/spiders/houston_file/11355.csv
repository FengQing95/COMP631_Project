JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love how this place has two different types of noodles: the thick and thin. The broth is rich and full of flavor. You can get the spicy level to your liking. My boyfriend really likes spicy and he got the "double inferno" spicy level. He was sweating from the first sip all throughout the entire meal, but he could not stop eating! The flavor was that good. The service was good. Both the pork and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The interior design was all very pretty. They are open late too which is always a plus.
