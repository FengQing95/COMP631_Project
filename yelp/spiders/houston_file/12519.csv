JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My Spicy Chicken Ramen (Jinya #1) hit the spot - perfect, thin noodles, delicious broth, crunchy green onions and bean sprouts...delightful. My only critique is that the menu lists that this dish can come in mild, medium or hot and the bartender didn't ask how we wanted it (and my fogged brain forgot to mention it) so it came mild. The soft boiled egg hidden between the chicken was a surprising perfect addition to the soup, which I'd seen but not tried before.
