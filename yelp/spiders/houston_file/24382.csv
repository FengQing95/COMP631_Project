Uchi////Now that I've been here a second time, I'm ready for this review!!!! Some friends from Oklahoma drove down to visit and they were like..."oh hey let's go to Uchi". And I'm thinking, "this place is hella expensive, why here?!" I seriously thought we were here to drink. I mean... this place has 4 DOLLAR SIGNS. That totally means if you're ready to spend then you should seriously go. Also I'm super glad I live in the area. I literally walked to Uchi. If I didn't, I would have missed out eating with my friends.
