Kata Robata////This is our go-to "treat yourself" spot. We ALWAYS get the Hawaiian Amberjake and Foie Gras. It's continually the best bite I've ever had. The miso lonster mac and cheese is creamy goodness and I'm a mac and cheese snob. The bone marrow with toasts is also so mind blowing my phenomenal. Melts in your mouth. This trip we tried the Foie Gras and Scallop sushi and were not disappointed. If we hadn't already run up the bill so much we would've gotten a second round. You can't go wrong here. Their ramen choices are always amazing as well.
