JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very popular spot for ramen in midtown but it's often hard to get a table or seat during a busy weekday or weekend. I've only dined in a few times over the past few years because of this and now I opt for ordering out from Jinya. I've never had issues with my takeout orders. Their ramen is top notch despite being a bit overpriced, and add ons can really bring the price up so be careful. It's totally worth getting on a cold day to warm up.
