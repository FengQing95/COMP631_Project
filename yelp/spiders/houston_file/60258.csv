Then you have to wait outside and listen for your name to be called. Food was okay. I don't understand what the hype was all about this place or why there is always a line here. I ordered the steak and eggs sunny side up with potatoes and my girlfriend ordered the green eggs. The steak wasn't tender, but edible. The green eggs were good, nothing spectacular. Overall, I would not wait 30+ minutes in line again here for the food. The only thing good here was the service.
