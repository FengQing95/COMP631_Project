Uchi////I really wanted to ADORE this place the way everyone I come across does. Even my family raves about Uchi. I've been many times, for drawn out dinners and happy hour tapas, to brunches and events with their catering. I think their food is very creative and unique, but at times misses the mark. I love exotic, strange foods and combinations, so I had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately, while the food and service has always been wonderful, I just find them a little overrated. Maybe it's because for sushi, I tend to side on the purist..give me fresh, flavorful sashimi and I'm good. But even so, some of the combinations were more of a "why...?" rather than an "ohh..!" I'd say my experiences have been half and half like this. Just a little too Americanized for my tastebuds. I will continue to go back, but it's definitely not my favorite like it is for so many others. I give them big kudos for thinking outside of the box though, and mainstreaming "weird" flavors/textures.
