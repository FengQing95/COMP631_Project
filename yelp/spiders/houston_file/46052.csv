Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is one of the nicest bakeries I have been to in Houston. It has that New York City meets Los Angeles feel to it. Upon entering you are immediately entranced by the post modern minimalist theme going. You enter the never ending queue hoping that you get to order what you want. Unfortunately, we got there a little after 2pm on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Most of the items were gone. We tried the cookie and the cinnamon roll. EXTREMELY DELICIOUS! I also got the brioche which was amazing. It was one of those things that you can sense is lacking something in flavor but you can't quite point out what exactly it is. The presentation was FLAWLESS.
