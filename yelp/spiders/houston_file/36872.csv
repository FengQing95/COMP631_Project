Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place had an incredible environment!! The wait staff alone was so attentive. So many whiskey options and varying drinks. The tomato bisque was really good. The drinks were costly and the old fashioned needs some work. Â Overall the cost over quality of food evens out to a decent four star.
