Local Foods////Delicious! Healthy! and Fresh! I've gotten their fresh garden salad and nova-lox. Their side dishes are also very light and healthy. I always get their kale salad and their soba noodles and they really help to augment their sandwiches. I even tried their butterscotch brownies once and was pleasantly surprised. It is not your typical brownie, and it is a little bread/cake like. Not too sweet but just enough. Very delicious. I've taken a few friends here and they all enjoyed their experience. Lunch time is pretty busy with most of the tables occupied and there is almost always a line, but the line goes pretty quick.
