Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been to Snooze a couple of times now. Unless you come pretty early in the morning, you're almost guaranteed to wait at least 45 minutes. However, I would say it's definitely worth the wait at least once. Great brunch spot on Montrose. Lots of different options for food...egg plates, benedicts, pancakes, tacos, and lots more. My favorite dish has been the hash so far. Lots of food and great fillings. The pancakes have also been a favorite..ask about their daily pancake!
