Uchi////We had the private room that comfortably fit 12 of us.  It took 3 hours to finish the entire dinner which was quite aggravating because we pretty much ordered the same thing per table (4 to a table) example: foie nigiri, each table ordered that, one table had their's first, the next table didn't get their's until an hour later, and then ours was literally at the end of the dinner which made no sense.   A bit of confusion with the tabs and the "contract" you have to sign for the private room but it was just too annoying to even complain about it at that point.  4 stars for the food everything else woulda have been a one star.
