Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Massive slices of dense sourdough bread were the star of the breakfast sandwich, in the sense that they were the best part, and also the sense that they were the main thing going on with the sandwich.  Bread was James Franco to the rest of the sandwich's General Hospital - kind of wonderful, kind of mismatched, kind of too much.  If anyone in Houston could dispense with the other ingredients and get away with $4 artisanal toast a la The Mill in SF, it's Common Bond.  (We'd mock it, but we'd still eat it.)
