Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////made my way to Bosscat on a stormy rainy day for lunch. On this particular day I must say that I was extra appreciative of the valet.  They made sure that I was not drenched by walking me to the entry with an umbrella!  My sincere thanks to them! The menu is quite interesting and there are always so many things that I want to try but it just wasn't the time to go all out, maybe for dinner next time.  I opted for the Cajun brick chicken since basically anything cajun is always full of spice.  I was not left disappointed the chicken was juicy and very flavorful and I really enjoyed the dirty rice that it came with. Our waitress was very attentive and always made sure that we had everything that we needed. Since it was lunch time I didnt really get to try the drinks but this place is just really inviting and hope to try a happy hour or dinner here!
