Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Passed by there several times and finally decided to see what all the hype was about. The layout and concept is very nice I must admit. The pastries are unique. However, they are a little too pricey for my taste. Don't get me wrong, the pastries are good but not $5 and up good.
