Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Finally went in for brunch and the food was divine! We were also given a fruit tart for free that the bakery was about to dispose of and it was amazing. The atmosphere is cool and always draws a crowd. I really enjoyed the Chefs Scramble, it was delicious and extremely filling. Will definitely be adding this to the brunch rotation!!
