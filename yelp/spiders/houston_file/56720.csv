Kata Robata////Yeah I ate until I almost exploded. NO RAGRETS DOE. Everything here is delicious. From the food to the sakes to the wines and def the awesome servers. We came here for my bf's birthday dinner and had a blast. We prob ordered way too much food but everything looked too good to say no. Most of the food we ordered was "cooked" food. The seared foie gras was prob my fav along with the skewers. Def get the skewers if you're aren't an adventurous type. Oh and the eggplant was so surprising. Like dang if my mom made veggies like that, I would have no problem eating them as a kid. The ambience is also really nice. Overall, such a great place for special occasion, treat yo self kinda night, or date. I can't wait to come back and food coma again ;)
