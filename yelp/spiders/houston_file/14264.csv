JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But for our restaurant, which is a high-volume, high-turnover establishment, the only way to keep seating fair and just for all our guests is to require parties be 100% complete before seating. There are exceptions to this rule, but during our peak dining times, we kindly request that all of our patrons adhere to this policy that we have posted at the host stand.
