Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I so love the location and the set up of the Resturant. Very rustic and yet it gives you an upscale vibe. Huge on the inside and have whiskey/beer tasting as well. I have no complaints about my order except for my cup of lemons had lipstick on the rim of the glass definitely not ideal especially with COVID. One of the apps I ordered was very dry and was missing something inside the pulled pork hush puppies, the dipping sauce that paired with it was not well. I ordered scalloped potatoes and seems like I received a fried has brown. The taste was amazing but the look I was expecting didn't come.
