Local Foods////Another welcome newcomer to the Houston dining scene - high end sandwiches and salads with excellent ingredients.  The greens for the arugula salad particularly were fantastic - rough flavorful watercress, Thai basil, strong mint, and of course an especially tasty version of the eponymous arugula. Stocky granules of sea salt gave the salad a lot of punch even without dressing.  We also especially enjoyed the chicken sandwich - no secret, since it appears to be the most popular dish - a combination of really moist roasted chicken, potato chips (yes) and greens, all on a pretzel bun.
