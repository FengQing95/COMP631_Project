The Pit Room////Two things that are absolutely amazing... Â Their barbecue sauce and their custard pie. In my mother's New York accent... TO DIE FOR. As I'm sure the fact we got the last bit of meat that was left since we got there lateron a Friday, it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped. Place seems always packed and again, parking can be tricky.
