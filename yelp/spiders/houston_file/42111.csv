Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food here is really good! There is a wide variety of pastries and bread, and their prepared items like the beet salad and quiche Lorraine are fantastic. My only complaint is the flow of ordering. There are certain items you order at the front of the line, certain items you order at the register, and it doesn't seem entirely logical (or efficient) to me. But we'll definitely be back!
