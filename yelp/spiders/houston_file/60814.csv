Baby Barnaby's////I absolutely love Baby Barnaby's. It is also another place that I have to stop by everytime I go back to Houston and I plan on being a regular here whenever I am permanently back in Houston. I don't know if the dog theme just sits well with my soul or what but this is my go to casual brunch spot.
