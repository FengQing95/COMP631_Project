Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I like the look of the place. However it does get crowded and parking is limited. You walk in and nice display of baked goods and desserts. Went to Common to get desserts. The fresh chocolate walnut cookies were so good that i bought more for home. Eclairs were nice and smioth tasting. Their service was smiling and quite helpful. The bread smelled good. I'll reserve a star till I try their cooked entrees. But I would definitely come back again.
