Uchi////My wife took me here for my birthday.  This place has the typical classy but not pretentious vibe seen in a lot of upscale Houston restaurants.  We got a 6 course tasting menu because we wanted to experience a wide breadth of what Uchi had to offer.  Our waitress was passionate about the menu and gave us detailed information regarding each dish. Every dish was worthwhile.  The foods burst with umami.  The dishes are 'cute' and presented well, although they are sparing in size.  We finished the six course and could have eaten more.  We did order some more sushi out of curiosity.  The sushi was fresh and the best quality I've eaten (my main point of reference is Sushi Zushi).  Some may be a little dissatisfied with the small portion size, but I managed to avoid that bloated engorged feeling as well.   It's a pricey place so best for special occasions or may be the Happy Hour.  The Houston restaurant scene has an asset in this place.
