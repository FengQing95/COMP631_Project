Kata Robata////A solid three stars, and would likely be 3.5 if the option were available. The main downfall is the service, which seemed ponderous and even a bit clueless. I don't typically mind a restaurant running out of fresh ingredients (they were out of the hamachi cheeks), but running out of two of three beers, and not mentioning it until a good five minutes after they've been ordered, seems a bit odd.
