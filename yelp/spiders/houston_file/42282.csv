Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Excellent place for breakfast or lunch, all pastries are absolutely first quality, fresh and tasty; they have and old-world taste like in a Parisian café; expect lots of people and a long line before your order is taken; also, sometimes is very hard to get a table right away and you are left holding your tray until one is available; however, it is worth all your troubles, I can, without hesitation,  tell you that you will be very satisfied and happy; the only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because of the wait.
