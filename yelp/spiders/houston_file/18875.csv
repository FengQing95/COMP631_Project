Uchi////Wagyu Beef Special: Wagyu Beef served Sous Vide with strawberries and foie gras gastrique. My absolute favorite, but it's a special so you can't get it every time. It was unbelievably tender and my poor chopstick skills just resulted a frustrating race to get my fair share from my nom-monster bf.
