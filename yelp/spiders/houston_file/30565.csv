The Pit Room////I've been to this joint twice now and it's the best pit bbq in Houston imo. Killens in pearland is close 2nd. The bark on ribs and brisket here is literally to die for. So so good, and the sides are second to none. HIGHLY recommend pork ribs and beef brisket with okra and loaded corn...wash it all down with a lime topo Chico and you're headed for a food coma. Enjoy!
