Uchi////This place was awesome! I've been wanting to try it for some time but the reservations are always full. Decided to wing it one Friday night and not make reservations - the wait was about 30 minutes but felt shorter with sake. It was my first time there and the waitress was personable and helpful. This is definitely the best sushi I've ever tried. I definitely recommend dining here and getting the meal that samples various dishes.
