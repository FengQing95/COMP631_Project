JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love this place! Staff was super friendly and we were seated right away. The food didn't take too long to come out. Everything was cooked right and came out with flavor. The only thing I didn't like was the awkward seating, kind of feels like everyone stuffed into the restaurant.
