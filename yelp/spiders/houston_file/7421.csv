JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Shalyn - Thanks for the review. Apologies that you didn't find the JINYA Chicken Ramen flavorful enough. With any preparation, there is the possibility that our ramen chefs made a mistake. They prepare several hundred bowls of ramen on any given day. Please know, however, that if you are not 100% satisfied with any of the food we serve, just inform your server and he/she will offer something else or gladly remove it from your tab. Our top priority is for every customer to leave our establishment satisfied. Full stop. Thank you again for the kind words, and we are glad to know you are willing to give us another shot.
