Uchi////We came for a birthday dinner with a few friends, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that in terms of pricing, it really isn't that bad. Most of the sushi and sashimi are what you would normally pay at other sushi restaurants around Houston. However, the atmosphere and environment is very warm and inviting. Front of house is helpful and courteous, and if you don't have reservations, waiting at the bar is just as enjoyable.
