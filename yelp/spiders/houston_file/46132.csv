Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On a rainy day in downtown Houston, this place had the vibrancy and the atmosphere to raise the mood and our spirits up! As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a beautiful assortment of amazing desserts and a friendly hello by the staff, the food very pleasant to look at! Drinking a warm and soothing cup of Lavender coffee right next to a window with racing raindrops: it's a whole vibe! My personal favorite treats were the Nutella croissant and the walnut chocolate chunk cookie! The atmosphere was super cozy and warm as it had a European flare to it with the charming dangling lightbulbs and the rustic wood tables, had a flashback when I was in downtown Stockholm, Sweden! If you are touring around Houston looking for a good coffee with a warm and inviting atmosphere, this is the place to go! Regardless if you're new to Houston or if you've lived here for years, this place is DEFINITELY worth a try! You won't be disappointed!
