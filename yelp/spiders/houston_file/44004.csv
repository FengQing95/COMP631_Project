Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also got a latte to go. While I was waiting for it I realized it was like 95 degrees outside and an iced latte sounded much better. I asked the barista if he could possibly make my drink iced and he was very very nice about it (even though the place was packed and I'm sure he had a long list of drinks to make). Great customer service! And the latte was amazing!!! I'm the kinda girl who needs sugar in her coffee but this tasted so good as is I didn't even feel the need to sweeten it. I would probably say it's one of the best lattes I've had!
