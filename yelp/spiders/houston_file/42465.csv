Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ugh...I ate too much bread.  I had the regular eclair and was very distracted by the fact that there was chocolate cream inside instead of the regular creme and can't say I liked it, but dang that chocolate creme was some good chocolate.  I ordered another salted caramel macaroon and wow...that was absolutely delicious.  So yummy!  Sweet, tasted and looked like real caramel, so so very good.  I also had a bite of the chocolate chip cookies...wow...now this is a real chocolate chip cookie, unlike the that cookie everyone at Tiny's raves about.  This whole bakery is just top notch!  Everything I tasted was A+ quality.  Very very good, I'm really impressed!
