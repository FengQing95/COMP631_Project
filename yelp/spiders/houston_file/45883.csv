Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond always hits the spot. No matter what I'm in the mood for whenever I come here I am instantly satisfied with whatever I order. Start your order with one of their fresh and delicious chocolate chip cookies, or feeling fat like me? I always go for the nutella croissant. It's covered with Nutella on the outside, and filled with Nutella on the inside. Absolutely perfect. I opt for their iced vanilla latte usually, but I've had a few other coffee flavors and they all have been good. I love the vibes here. It's a very open layout, and I just love coming here to hang out with friends and chat. I have yet to try more of their main course options. I have had their bread and cheese dips and a bunch of their pastries and desserts. I would highly recommend!! Everything i have tried has always been DELISH! A very cute spot in the heart of Montrose. Parking is sometimes an issue because their lot is so small. But worry not, there is plenty of street parking around, and they have a separate lot up the street as well for their customers which was a good find!
