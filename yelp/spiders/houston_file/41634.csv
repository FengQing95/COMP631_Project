Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////5 stars for the pastries.  Damn they were good.  I had a normal croissant, an almond croissant and the chocolate chip cookie.  I prefer my chocolate chip cookies more crispy but it was still pretty good.  The croissants were probably the best I have ever had.  So crispy and flaky!  My mom was wondering why she saw people peel them and eat them layer by layer.  Now we know why!
