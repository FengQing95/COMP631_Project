Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I like the food here. I have been recently for brunch and lunch. I do prefer brunch because the food choices are a bit healthier. For brunch, I had avocado toast, egg whites, and turkey sausage. It was all spectacular. I do wish they had coffee drinks, but they do serve Katz Coffee. It is good, but it was $5.00, which we thought was pretty expensive, especially since I had only one cup. It is a bar scene so it's casual and always noisy. Don't come here expecting a nice place for quiet conversation. Service is ok, but because it is a busy and crowded restaurant, service is spotty. There is valet parking and the parking lot is a bit small and busy. The valets are actually very nice and polite. It has a nice vibe and it is a fun place to go.
