Kata Robata////I give this place a solid 4 stars, but not necessarily for the sushi! If you like legit RAMEN, this is the place to go!!! The hubby and I frequent this place because we do enjoy the ambiance and the upscale setting, it's good for date night. However, it's pricey in terms of the sushi, for the amount of food that you get. Don't get me wrong, it's a great quality fish and that probably justifies some of the price, but the rolls can be pretty expensive and they are kind of small! I don't mind paying $15+ for a roll, but I expect it to be hearty with lots of fish and ingredients. But my gosh, the pork ramen here is so amazing! It even beats some of the ramen houses in Houston that are also very good. It's about $16 for a very large bowl of ramen and you leave feeling very satisfied, and most importantly, FULL.
