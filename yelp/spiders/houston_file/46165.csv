Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I will ALWAYS get the Kouign-Amann - it's like a croissant that was layered with sheets of sugar between the filo dough and then the outside achieves a shell that gives you the perfect amount of crunch when you take that first bite. The little cakes are also a delicious little snack. The flavors are not overpoweringly sweet and it looks like you can even get big cakes for your birthday or next big event. I saw the chef (or would it be baker?) sit down with a couple to help them pick out wedding cake flavors so that is also a feature they have.
