Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Best brunch in Houston hands down. Get there early, the line will hit a solid hour and a half wait on a late Sunday brunch. Favs- upside pineapple pancake and a half order of the OMG French toast. For a single- Bartops are awesome, with a fabulous group that will take phenomenal care of you.
