Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I just love this place. Every time I've been, whether its just to stop in for coffee on a lunch break or brunch with friends, I have had a great experience! Super yummy food options- savory & sweet - and coffee is right on par. Also the natural light from the big windows & clean/fresh decor are a nice touch.
