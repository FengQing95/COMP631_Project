The Pit Room////the best bbq i have ever had in my life! we got in line and ordered some brisket, beef ribs, coleslaw, elote, and mac and cheese. the cost per pound of the ribs ($22!) was a little bit of a sticker shock but it's definitely the number 1 item on their menu. next time we go, i would pay up and just get 2-3 lbs of the ribs. their brisket is delicious in its own right, but unfortunately gets outshined by the ribs.
