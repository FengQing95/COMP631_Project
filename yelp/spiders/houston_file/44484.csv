Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything about this place was perfect. Atmosphere, coffee, and pastries were great. My boyfriend and I had to stop by before we headed back to Dallas and I'm definitely glad that we made the decision to. When you first walk in, you realize how chic and modern this place is. They have windows everywhere and natural lighting his every corner of this place.
