JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've heard a lot of hype about this place and it definitely lives up to it. The pork bao bun was amazing. If you like spicy food, I'd recommend specifically asking them to make it extra spicy. I just ordered the spiciest option that was written on the menu, but I didn't find it spicy at all. It seems to get pretty crowded so expect a wait but it's completely worth it.
