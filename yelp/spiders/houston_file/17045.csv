JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Some of the best ramen I've had. The only place I will go and sit by myself just to enjoy the goodness. Watched a whole episode of love island. I got the tankatsu black the first time I think and then the second time I added corn and spicy chili sauce for some extra pizzaz. Also tried the lychee cocktail. It was very yummy and unique. The inside is understated and casual
