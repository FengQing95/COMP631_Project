Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came on a Friday morning, and the wait time wasn't too bad. We waited for about 15-20 minutes. Our server was incredible. She was really funny, and she even gave us a complimentary pancake. It was a special that wasn't on the menu, and it was the highlight of our morning. The pancake had some pieces of bacon, candied pecans, and caramel. It was so delicious!
