Local Foods////My favorite sandwiches are the crunchy chicken and the vegetarian. The vegetarian one is actually really tasty for non-vegetarians because the curried cauliflower on the inside is thick, meaty, and flavorful. Love this place even though it's difficult to find a seat during lunch time!
