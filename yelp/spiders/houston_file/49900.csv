Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to the location in Denver & wanted to see if Houston could keep its great reputation. Came here on a Sunday to find out there was a 1 1/2 wait, so we didn't even bother. Tried the next day & only waited 15 minutes, so I recommend everyone to go on a weekday possibly Monday - Wednesday. We did keep ourselves busy for that time playing jenga.
