JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Stephanie - Thanks for the 5 stars ! I appreciate your taking the time to review your dining experience with us, and I'm happy to know we have done right by you in the most important regards. There is a shared, 3-story parking garage on Elgin Street. Though it does tend to fill up quickly on the weekends. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
