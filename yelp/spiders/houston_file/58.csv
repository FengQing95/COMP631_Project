Local Foods////Yeah.. the idea of Local Foods is great, looks nice on the inside and staff is nice. But I must say I was highly underwhelmed & disappointed with my purchase. After reading the reviews and hearing the high praise from other yelpers.. So I tried it out one evening after leaving the gym. I purchased the duck contit or what ever its called. I was unpleasantly surprised. The sandwich was extremely greasy and did not taste in any way fresh.. the duck tasted like it had been in the freezer too long yanked out flung in the microwave and served on some toast... The only highlight of the sandwhich was what ever jam that was slapped on either side of the bread. I didn't realize they put mayo on the sand which and I hate mayo yuck! But I found myself highly dissatisfied with the sandwich, I got the potato salad and another side item I don't recall..highly unsatisfactory, not taste at all and not very fresh...who knows maybe I received a bad batch of everything. I might try it again with a different order maybe.....Local Foods... to say the least, not pleased.
