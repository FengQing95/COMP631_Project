JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was perfect on a cold day. I ordered the spicy creamy vegan ramen with mushrooms and thin noodles. I liked it the most from what we ordered. It was a huge bowl and seasoned well. I added a little bit of the condiments at the table to experiment. We also had the sweet potato fries and spicy tuna taco thing (I can't remember the name). The fries were ok and came with honey with a touch of mayonnaise, which I thought was weird. The spicy tuna taco thing wasn't anything special.
