JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tried this place for the first time and absolutely loved it! Tried the Tonkotsu black and it was perfect, not to mention the Jinya bun was to die for! I definitely suggest coming here to relax with friends or significant other. It has a very warm atmosphere and definitively filled with tons of people. If you want to try something new try this place. Plus they have these heating poles that you can get warmed up by outside when it's cold out, very nice!
