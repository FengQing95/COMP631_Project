JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pros: I really appreciated that there was a garage where you can park free right at the corner of the restaurant. The restaurant itself was indeed more of a bar than a ramen house. There are screens playing sports and the background music was contemporary pop. However their ramen was definitely among the best ones I have ever had. We tried the regular spicy umami miso ramen and the vegan miso ramen. The broth for both was very creamy without being overly salty. The noodle itself was on the chewy side which I prefer.
