Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't eat here all the time because I would be so fat. Great Sunday brunch there it gets busy so go early! The coffee rules I've pretty much tried all their pastries...rules. My boyfriend and I will forever be searching for their Octopus Mash again. The menu changes sometimes which is also very cool!
