Local Foods////Now for the real stuff: The food! I usually get the smoked salmon sandwich, and its really good! The salmon and cream cheese really complement each other and the texture is perfect in combination with the bread. I have also tried the crunchy chicken sandwich (which I recommend) and the steak and egg sandwich (which I do not recommend). The sides are just alright; I usually get the fresh fruit (usually grapefruit) and the chips. But if you want to be more adventurous they have some interesting sides like quinoa and kale.
