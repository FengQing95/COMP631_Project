Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started off with the parmesan crusted meatloaf which was delicious (and I don't normally like meatloaf). It had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and was nice and soft in the middle. Next we got the cornbread madelines with huckleberry butter. We expected them to come out hot but once we dipped them in that butter we were not disappointed! We wanted to take that butter home with us it was so good.
