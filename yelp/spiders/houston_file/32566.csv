Local Foods////The cashier recommended the crunchy chicken, for the sides I got kale and couscous. When it was brought out, the sandwich was gigantic. The chicken was moist and full of flavors from the fresh veggies and sauce. I couldn't stopped eating. In my opinion, the sides had a little too much vinaigrette for my tasting, but still good. It had plenty of parking and friendly service. I will be back.
