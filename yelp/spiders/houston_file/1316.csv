JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Houston basically hasn't had winter this year, until just a few days ago and I have to say that getting ramen was the perfect way to welcome the cold weather! A friend wanted to try this place so we decided to go and I definitely do not regret it! We went on a Monday night and even then it was busy as ever! We ended up sitting at the bar because we didn't want to wait an hour for a table. So if you don't mind sitting at the bar, I'd definitely recommend you do! We ordered, ate, and paid all before our table was called. Even so, I still have to give the place 5 stars because of the food..it's that good.
