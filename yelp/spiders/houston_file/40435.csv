Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We tried the brunch today - everything was spectacular! The ambience is nice, service by Jerry was superb, and the food was delicious. We tried the Chilaquiles, Smokehouse egg benedict, shrimp and grits, and the apple cheesecake waffle. We will be back to do whiskey tasting.
