Kata Robata////I rarely write reviews unless the place REALLY deserve my time.. Kata robata upsets me n many people I've spoken to! I'm a huge sushi snob, I go to Uchi at least once every other month, MF omakase every month, and kata at least 3-4 times over the past few months.. the food is not as good as my top picks but it is better than other japanese restaurants.. plus, it is a lot CHEAPER!! The only thing that refrain me from going to this place, is THE HOSTESS!! ALL OF THEM!! I usually come here when I don't have reservations to UChi or MF on Fridays n saturdays.. those little asian girls r extremely rude and snobby!! they think they r God or something! EVERY SINGLE TIME I go here, they r ALWAYS extremely rude when we have NEVER EVER spoken to them rudely at all, we always politely wait and always ask nicely how long is our wait bcuz I believe it doesn't help to be rude to restaurants employees. But these girls have always answered very rudely, or they wont even give us a table even though we have been there before others who walked in without a reservations! and one time, our waiter pulled up a chair for me bcuz we had 1 extra person at the table, the stupid hostess girl came to me and told me I cannot sit there, she insisted that the manager does not approve of it.. I told her the waiter is the one who said I could sit there, she then said that she doesn't want me to get hurt if someone pushed my chair, I politely told her to not worry I won't get hurt n she finally left.. There was no way I could be in anyone's way, our table is in a corner and NO ONE will ever walk that way for any reason!! The only time I will put up with these girls is if I cannot get reservations to Uchi or MF omakase, other than that, I will never wanna come here because of them! I do love their Â green tea cheesecake
