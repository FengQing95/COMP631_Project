Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Initially, I wanted to order the pancake flight but I knew I wouldn't be able to eat all three pancakes by myself. So I went with the OMG French Toast, Scrambled Egg, Chicken Sausage, Hash Browns & a caramel latte. Â Everything....Everything was fantastic! But before my order came out, a Frosted Sticky Bun pancake was brought to my table "compliments from my server". Then while I was eating this heavenly tasting pancake (taste like it was made by The Creator Himself) a gentleman walked up, and kneeled down to verify everything was tasting divine (I'm still wondering if he was the owner or a manager). I could tell he had a passion for Snooze, he seemed invested and determined to make sure every customer was 100% satisfied.
