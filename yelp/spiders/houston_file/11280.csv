JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my only experience, but the ramen was meh.  I ordered the Cha Cha Cha.  The tonkotsu broth had that lip smacking consistency, but it lacked depth and flavor.  It's like they made a good stock and then added water to stretch it out.  The gyoza were ok and the salad was a throw in.  Wish they offered a cha han and gyoza combo.
