Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////like the huge Texas sized croissant, the koughe amman and the big chocolate chip cookies are worth the trip and my current favorite is the egg and ham sandwich they have for breakfast. The management and staff are overall usually nice and helpful. The only person I've occasionally felt dished out some attitude was the first person you encounter in the ordering line whose sole job is to fetch the ready made baked goods and place them in a dish or fancy box for you to go.
