Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So many pretty pastries! Didn't know what to get my first time here, but I was most interested in the breads. An employee gave me some recommendations and I went with the seeded baguette! At $3.50, it's a bit steep, but it was yum. Also, I know it'll last me all week. I was there mostly to do some studying, and it was a nice ambiance for that. Will def be back soon to try their desserts and croissants!
