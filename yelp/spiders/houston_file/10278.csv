JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu Assari & Jinya Tonkotsu Black- both ramens tasted pretty similar, in my opinion. The broths weren't too salty so that's a plus. It was pretty good. The only difference was that the tonkotsu black had more toppings and it had spice (although it was not spicy at all). The Assari had wide noodles and the black had thin noodles. I think I like the thin noodles more.
