Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service is fast and friendly. However, I had to subtract one star for the wait and parking. I'd definitely recommend coming here early or be prepared for a long wait. We came as a large party of 8 on an early Friday morning right around opening time, and only waited 20 minutes for a table. However by the time we were leaving, the restaurant was already packed. Parking is abysmal. The Snooze is tiny, so you're left to street park at your own discretion.
