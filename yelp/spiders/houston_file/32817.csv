Local Foods////I visited Local Foods today for lunch with a friend. I marveled at the clean and modern but homey decor. We delighted over the delicious offerings - I settled on the duck confit sandwich with the tuscan kale and coleslaw sides, both of which were delicious! We ordered, sat down, and my friend's food arrived immediately.
