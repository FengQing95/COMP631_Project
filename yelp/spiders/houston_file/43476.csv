Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Houston has it's fare share of caf√©s that claim a French connection...as one that has tried out several of those, I recommend coming here. Outside of the great atmosphere that this place has, the pastries are spot on. If you have ever tasted a croissant in France, this place will be closest you'll get to that taste, with the right balance between butter & sugar.
