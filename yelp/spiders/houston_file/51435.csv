Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Have been meaning to try this place but the long waits was a bit off putting. I've also been to the one in Arizona and didn't think it was anything to rave about. We decided to check this place out on a random Tuesday around 10am and it wasn't super busy - we got seated right away for a table of 2 and there were plenty of open tables.
