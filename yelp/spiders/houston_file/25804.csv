The Pit Room////Your gonna have to go find, then slap everyone who has ever served you what they called Bar-B-Q in your entire life. This place is hands down the best. Served on a tray because they're upper class hipsters and know your gonna get messy. I had the "two meat" plate. (Ribs and brisket) excellent plate to judge some basics. Also had the corn for a side. DO THE CORN! It's sort of a dry version of an "Elot√©" in a bowl. my other side was green beans. (Very fresh) Now, because my friend couldn't finish his sausage, he offered up and awe dam I'm glad i did. I washed it all down with a iced tea and walked outside to check out what was next door. In between the two businesses was the pit's sticking out of the wall. To my surprise, the young man outside taking a break was the pit master and meat cook. I only knew this because he took the time to talk to me and asked me if i enjoyed my meal. This place has an excellent reputation for what is served and that is more than great bar-b-q. They also serve hospitality like grandpa had with his friends and a genuine, true, family owned modern Bar-B-Q house should. I will be back. Many times. Even if its a little more pricey, IT'S WORTH IT!
