Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////On to the food...we started out with the chicken and cheese dip which was very good and a bit spicy. My boyfriend got the 12 hr short rib - which was fabulous - I wish I had gotten that! I got the brick chicken and I wasn't a fan. The chicken was fatty in my opinion and the rice was not my favorite. If I were to return, I'd get the short rib but I don't know if I would come back given the loud music.
