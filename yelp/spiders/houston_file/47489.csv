Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////IT takes forever for them to get your food and if you go to early there is a 3 hr wait at times, but once you sit and get your drink, youll be ok. You cant go wrong with breakfast until 2p.m. everyday. Coffee is amazing, even has boomtown brand. Specialty drinks are creatively named with good flavor. Dishes are huge depending on what you order... One of my favorites.. Would get 5 star if wait wasnt so long and food ordering
