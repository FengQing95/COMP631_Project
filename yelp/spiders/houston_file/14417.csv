JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really like the vibe of this place. My friend and I went at night so it was very dim, a calming atmosphere. It was my first time going to a ramen spot and being seated at a huge table amongst 12+ other people. Even though this was our seating arrangement, it still felt intimate with my company. I hope that makes sense. I absolutely loooooove ramen and I saw this was one of the highest rated places to go. I got the JINYA chicken ramen and my friend got the spicy chicken ramen. Both were delicious! We also shared the crispy chicken bites. They were pretty small but very flavorful and light...not greasy at all! This was also my best friend's first time trying ramen and she said she LOVED it. She's an extremely picky eater so that made me so happy to see her try and like something different! Only reason I give it a 4 is because I had to add egg whereas some of the other bowls come with it and other places I've been the egg is already in the chicken ramen bowl. Customer service and flavor though is 10/10!
