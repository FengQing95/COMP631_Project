Kata Robata////Rock 'n Roll - this is were Kata Robata sort of drops the ball. It's nice but nothing fancy or palatable. The rice seems like too much in quantity and I couldn't really taste any of the ingredients that well. If you go a few miles south there's a place called Asahi that does a lovely Rock 'n Roll with great seasoning and sauce for cheaper.
