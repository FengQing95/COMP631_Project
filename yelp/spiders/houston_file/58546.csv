Baby Barnaby's////So, minus 1 star for ridiculous service policies and insistent arguing with customers who weren't asking for anything the restaurant doesn't normally do, and minus 1 star for the combo of lack of parking, making people wait outside in cold weather (when clearly next door was open and being used by staff), with no real heating (crowding around the one heat lamp only barely heated the tops of our heads), and being so small that with one person before you it still takes 30 minutes to get a table.
