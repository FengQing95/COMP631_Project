Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Visited around 8:30PM on a Friday night. We had a 45-1 hour wait for a table for 4. Very nice aesthetic. Music was too loud, even our waiters had a tough time hearing our orders. Drinks were very strong and prices are on the expensive side. We has the Boss Lady, Whiskey Sour and Southsider. We also tried the B&B burger and Bosscat fries. Both were delicious and had big portions. Staff was nice and waiters were very knowledgeable about the menu.
