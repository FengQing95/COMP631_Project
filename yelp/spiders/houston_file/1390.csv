JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The best ramen I've had outside of San Diego. The only meh part of the ramen is the egg. It's a boiled egg, rather than the super soft 63-65 degree egg you get in some other ramen joints. Still though, the broth was perfect, noodles were perfect, the pork was tender and flavorful, and the price isn't that bad.
