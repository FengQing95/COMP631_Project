Local Foods////I cannot get enough of this place. I would have never thought to put the ingredients that they have together. All of the flavors really stand out on their own but also come together as well. The crunchy chicken sandwich and the garden sammie are my absolute favorites. Also the sandwiches are massive! They are so hefty. Everything is so fresh. Must try restaurant!
