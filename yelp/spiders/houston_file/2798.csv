JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is one of my favorite Ramen places. Has a modern flare to it, though very difficult to get on the internet to post anything in this location, but if I were to recommend one of the bowls, I would choose Jinya's Tonokotsu Black. In my opinion this dish has the perfect balance of creaminess & saltiness of the broth. The meat was also very savory & soft. With a combination of all this and seaweed, onions, garlic & a beautifully cooked egg it really becomes a truly delectable bowl. Jinya is a lovely eat and relax with your friends & family.
