JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best place to get a bowl of ramen in a lively and upbeat atmosphere! Such a fun place to come with friends. The community table can be a bit rowdy but if you don't mind sitting next to other groups it can be a good time. You're lucky if you get a booth here. Wait can be long but it's worth it, you can also always get a boba tea next door while you wait too!
