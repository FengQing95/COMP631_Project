Local Foods////My 2 all time go to dishes are the crunchy chicken sandwich and the arugula salad. The crunchy chicken sandwich has the best pretzel bun! The sandwich us a burst of flavor, and I love the chips added inside. You can either get 2 sides or a soup with a sandwich. For sides, I really like the beets, kale salad, and quinoa. I really like the soup there too.
