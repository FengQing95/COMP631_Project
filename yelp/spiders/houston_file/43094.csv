Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries are great, but I really come here for the bread. Soooo good. As a barista of many years, I love trying new shops and supporting places that serve locally roasted coffee. I have given their espresso many chances, but it simply hasn't been good. They use good-quality beans, but don't seem to be treating them right. I would skip the spro and get a hot chocolate, chai, or fresh OJ.
