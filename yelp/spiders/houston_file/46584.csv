Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a great cafe to come to for good food and drinks when you want a lowkey vibe. Their Nashville hot chicken sandwich tastes so good!! The grilled cheese and soup combo is good - nothing special but it's a staple. If you're a fan of oatmeal pies you gotta try theirs! It's so yummy!! I also tried their lavender mimosa and I'm HOOKED. It looks like white wine but it definitely doesn't taste like it - the lavender flavor is lovely and delicate.
