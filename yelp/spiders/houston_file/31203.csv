Local Foods////They have a small menu of gourmet sandwiches.  I got the shrimp and crab sandwich and the duck confit sandwich.  Each sandwich comes with 2 sides.  I have to say while both sandwiches were good the duck confit one was amazing!! It has duck, brie cheese, arugula, and cranberry preserve.  Oh my gosh just really amazing.  The seafood one was also good, a lot of lump REAL crab and a delicious green sauce.  For the sides we had homemade potato chips, potato salad, kale salad, and cole slaw.  The kale salad was the real winner for me, golden raisins and truffles made it amazing.  Really enjoyed the Asian cole slaw as well.  The potato chips and potato salad were just okay.
