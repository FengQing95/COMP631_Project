JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We had a great experience at Jinya Ramen Bar which seems to be a great place and price for ramen bowels in Houston. We went with a group of 5 on New Years Day and expectedly there was about a one hour wait. Their indoor waiting area is limited and due to the cold weather everyone was crowded inside but the hosts and waitstaff were still well organized, pleasant, and had good communication. We were seated as quickly as possible for a busy day.
