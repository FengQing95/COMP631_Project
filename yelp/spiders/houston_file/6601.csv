JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My family of 8 barely had to wait and was seated immediately. However, we tried to go the night before and the wait was an hour. If you're in a big party, try to go on none peak times. We tried a variety of their appetizers and all were amazing! Their garlic ramen and tonkotsu black were so good.
