Kata Robata////For an omakase, the pricing was reasonable, and the food was delicious. We were surprisingly full by the end of it as well! One of my favorite dishes was the sashimi boat with the seared barracuda. There was this amazing smokiness to it with a nice crunch from the sear. I also really enjoyed the teapot soup (soup that's actually served in a teapot - so cute!), and the hot stone rice bowl with uni. The hot stone rice bowl came with Japanese uni, which is much more decadent and richer in flavor, and pretty amazing.
