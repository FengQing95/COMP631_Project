Local Foods////It seems to me that Local Foods is a great place to have lunch.  The inside of the restaurant has a retro, sort of industrial style to it. As you enter, look for one of those corrugated cardboard backed menus to see the offerings. You order & pay at the counter, get a number and restaurant staff brings your food to you.
