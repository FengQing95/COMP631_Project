Uchi////We started with the hama chili, which I highly recommend.  It had all those things that I love about Thai food, a little heat from the Thai chili and a little sweet and sour from the orange slices.  We also had the yokai berry and the machi cure, all from the cool tastings.  The machi cure was as good as everyone said it was - bonus points for being encouraged to eat with your fingers in a nice restaurant!  The yokai berry was an antioxidant-inspired dish.  I didn't think I liked kale, but this dish changed my mind.
