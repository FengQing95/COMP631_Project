Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wow, just wow. The decor is stunning. The bartenders are dressed as sexy lumberjacks in overalls was my impression. I saw 3 male bartenders and 1 female but im not sure if that is the norm. They have craft cocktails that are VERY pricy but this place is meant for the young adult out of college with good job and money to burn. Or even the silverspoon hotties that run the city. However stuckuo and snobby this place is not. Although its clearly a money crowd the place was loud full of energy and just fun. The food is reasonably priced. I tried the pulled pork hushpuppies and the fries. The hushpuppies were ok but the fries were good. I would recommend this place for a work happyhour.
