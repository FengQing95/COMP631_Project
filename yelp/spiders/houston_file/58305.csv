Baby Barnaby's////i used to live on Waugh st. in the neighborhood behind Barnaby's. i love being able to walk to my favorite restaurant! I spent the night in jail once for traffic tickets. When i got out i was on a mission to eat the BEST food in town Barnaby's was the first and only choice! If you are not fortunate enough to make the breakfast, no worries the lunch Barnaby's next door is great too! Thanks for a great neighborhood gem!
