Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here before for brunch, desserts, and coffee. It's always SO PACKED no matter when you go, which is the only downside since the space is so small. The best thing about this place are the baked goods and desserts. I've never tried anything I didn't LOVEEE. Their chocolate chip cookies are out of this world. Their croissants are huge in size and good in taste. The desserts are so aesthetically pleasing AND tasty. Their brunch/lunch items are unique and my kind of food. I'm always so happy when I'm here.
