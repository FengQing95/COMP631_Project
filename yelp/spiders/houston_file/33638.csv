Local Foods////Local Foods is by far my favorite place to go for a casual lunch or dinner. Anytime my friends are stuck on where to go I always suggest Local Foods. It is a little pricey for my usual "lunch" budget but oh so worth it. I am a fan of the Egg Salad sandwich as well as the Market Veggie sandwich. Even though I'm a vegetarian and love vegetables, it takes a very special sandwich for me to get near a brussel sprout and I eat them like candy in the Market Veggie.
