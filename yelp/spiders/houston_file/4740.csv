JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brittany - Thank you for your review and very constructive feedback. I have spoken to our bartending staff at Midtown and all of our other JINYA locations, and we will take this teachable moment to heart. The server should have offered to remake your order, or perhaps offer a discount to compensate for the error. I apologize for this.
