Uchi////- Brussels Sprouts: If you go here and don't get them... what are you doing? This made me a convert to brussels sprouts. There are a dozen imitator recipes online, and even following Uchi's own published recipe I can't replicate it. Sweet, vinegary, spicy, lemony, crispy. A revelation. Execution can be uneven but you have to get it.
