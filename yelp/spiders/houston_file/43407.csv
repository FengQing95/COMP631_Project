Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place! Their bakery and lattes are sweet and delightful. Come here for brunch or breakfast with a friend. The restaurant has an open design and is full of light from the floor to ceiling windows. Parking is not the best, the private lot has limited space during Saturday/Sunday.
