Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The breakfast here is served for Kings. Large portions and tasty. I usually get the classic platter or the pineapple upside down pancakes(to die for). The pancakes arE HUGE! They are a meal on their own. The service is fast and welcoming. The coffee keeps coming and it's a pretty neat breakfast joint.
