Kata Robata////Also tried a scallop dish (not the sexy scallop roll) which was good but the scallops were sliced so thin that it kept crumbling apart when I used chopsticks. The flavor was all right but the liquid the dish came with overpowered the scallops themselves while the radishes detracted from the scallops' texture.
