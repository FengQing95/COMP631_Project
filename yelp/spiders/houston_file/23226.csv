Uchi////Despite reserving for 2 at the wrong location (in Austin), the restaurant staff still found seats for us at the bar. The interior has a modern edginess Â to it with areas purposely lit dimmer. Music played noticeably in the background, but never really interfered with conversation. At 7pm, the restaurant's hustle and bustle moved elegantly.
