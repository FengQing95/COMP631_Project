Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One of my girlfriends and I came on Sunday afternoon around 2 pm to check it out because it was new. Don't go on Sunday brunch if you want to catch up or have a long conversation with someone. Brunch definitely draws in a LOUD CROWD and loud music almost like a bar scene. Service was great and attentive though.
