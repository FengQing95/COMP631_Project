Kata Robata////I have eaten at almost every sushi restaurant in Houston and Kata Robata is the best. The best advice I can give is to go to there during lunch, sit at the sushi bar and Â get the 7-piece lunch ($20; includes 7 nigiri and 8 pieces of spicy tuna roll and caliroll). Being as young as I am I can't afford super expensive sushi a lot but the lunch special lets me ball out without breaking the bank. Very professional place and the workers are always kind, and hard working.
