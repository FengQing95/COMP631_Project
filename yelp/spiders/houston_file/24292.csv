Uchi////Their sushi options are always fresh and creative, not typical, and their kitchen menu is also tasty and foodie-approved. They also have a great happy hour menu, though the line starts before the open so you should try and make a reservation. I can't list out everything I've eaten, because there's too many and I have a bad memory, but almost everything I've had has been superb. Make sure you save room for dessert too, because they are fantabulous.
