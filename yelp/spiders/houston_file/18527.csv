Uchi////Ok the reason why I'm giving this place three stars compared to the four and five that I was getting is because of the service!! I do admit the food is absolutely delicious and very good quality! And our waitress was great but the young hostess were the most rude and unprofessional I have ever seen! Your first impression is when you walk in and I had a horrible one! It was my BIRTHDAY so I made reservations I was so excited bc of the hype that everyone told me even my friend from my group said I won't regret it and he was excited for his second time! So I made reservations for exactly 5 which is apparently the time they open so we waited and when they opened I told the waitress that we made reservations for 6, 5 of us were already there?! And while she sat others and me and my party were standing I thought it was somewhat odd since we made the reservations so I asked my bf to ask her what the hold up was. When he walked back he was red faced and upset ? I asked what the problem was he said that bc our last person in our party isn't here she won't sit us and that she should have pretty much canceled our reservation bc our whole party wasn't here but she didn't and that if she seats us we would need to be done by 7:00 bc of other reservations meanwhile the time was already 530 since she made us wait and stand for thirty minutes. I got so angry and said she is giving us an ultimatum?? Are you kidding me? Today is my birthday and I don't mean to sound like a brat but your giving someone and hour in a half to eat? How do you expect me to enjoy my food! I got so upset i almost cried bc it was just ridiculous! So now my whole party is upset we FINALLY GET SEATED! And apparently they told our waitress and our waitress had to come and apologize! But as I examined the room there were so many open tables and available seating! Why were we practically being kicked out! Also I noticed that one of their hostess would come back and just walk passed us just to see if we were almost done! Â
