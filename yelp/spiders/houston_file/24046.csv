Uchi////The food are unique, tasty, and pricey. Expect the portion to be in small sizes. We ordered 11 things from the menu and every single dish was from 2-4 bites in average. It's more like a tasting experience dinner to me. The dishes has high quality in taste and come with beautiful representations. They're all are fresh and yummy. My favorites were the Nasu eggplant, Foie Gras duck liver, and Machi cure (yellow tail).
