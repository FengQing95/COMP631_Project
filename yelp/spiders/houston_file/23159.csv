Uchi////Uchi is inventive, fine dining at it's best. Yup, it's expensive...especially for Japanese food. Â But if you go for happy hour, they have great specials on both food and drinks. I've been to Tokyo and I will tell you Uchi is authentic. They serve you a hot towel to clean your hands before your meal, just like they do in Japan. They serve you in small glasses, just like they do in Japan.
