Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Amazing brunch, fantastic cocktails. I don't think you can go wrong with the menu - especially liked the carnitas benedict and the banana bread french toast. My only complaint: please take reservations. The wait would have been 1.5 hrs if we hadn't been willing to sit outside.
