Kata Robata////Miso Lobster Mac and Cheese ($23): This dish was probably the best bang for your buck. This plate, by itself, is enough to fill up one person. The parmesan cheese, Marieke gouda, and Veldhuizen cheddar, were perfect; it was velvety and creamy, but not too heavy. They didn't skimp out on the lobster pieces because I felt like there was almost always a piece of lobster in every bite.
