Baby Barnaby's////As soon as we sat down, we were greeted by our server. He was very friendly and made sure we had the best brunch-ing experience. My dad ordered the migas, my brother and I ordered the green eggs and huevos rancheros and my mom ordered the banana walnut pancakes with a side of potatoes. We ordered their freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices as well. Boy oh boy were we all surprised we had never come here before!
