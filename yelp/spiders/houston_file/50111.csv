Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The hyped snooze hits town, and people are going crazy for it. Evidence to prove this is the long wait you will experience when you try to check this place out. I came on a Saturday morning at 10 AM and had an 80 minute wait. I took advantage of their text when ready system by getting on the list, and running errands in the area. This made it bearable as the waiting area is small and most people end up waiting outside, or in the longg line at the bar.
