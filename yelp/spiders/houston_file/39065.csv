Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was REALLY busy and REALLY loud limiting conversation to spats of my friend and I screaming at each other.  It's one of those places that's so busy, nobody goes there any more (Yogi Berra).  That and being sat in high traffic convinced us to wrap it up after one drink and find another place.  Shame, because the menu looked pretty good.
