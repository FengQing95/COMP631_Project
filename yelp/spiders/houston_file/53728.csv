Kata Robata////I refuse to pay full price for sushi in a town that has amazing sushi happy hour prices; however, one must admit that California rolls and gyozas get a bit tiresome.  THANK GOODNESS for the Kata Robata happy hour with their amazing happy hour menu.  Expect to pay a little more for the menu items, but the prices are amazing compared to what they charge on the regular.  PLUS, the food is amazing and unique.  Last night, my girlfriend and I feasted on Kobe beef tacos (yum), pork belly buns (wrapped like you would eat peking duck - DEEEE LISH OUS - we ordered two servings), kimchee chicken karaage (deep fried morsels of goodness sitting on top of some kimchee grits...yeah, that's right...KIMCHEE GRITS-so good).  Although not part of the happy hour menu, we also ordered the sashime platter with three tasty sauces.  $20 for about 15 healthy pieces of fresh, delicious salmon, tuna and white tuna.  PLUS, there is ample parking, no valet doucebagery, and happy hour prices on the weekdays until 7pm in the ENTIRE restaurant!   My favorite sushi happy hour in Houston.    They get a one star demotion for their expensive regular hour prices...but I guess you get what you pay for.
