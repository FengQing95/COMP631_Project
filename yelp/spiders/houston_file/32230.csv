Local Foods////I've been here twice, and for some reason, the second time just wasn't as good as the first. Maybe it's the sandwich....The first time I had the famous Crunchy Chicken sandwich, and it was DELICIOUS. I got some beans and the chips for the two sides. Chips = absolutely YUMMILICIOUS. Beans = just okay. I also got a cup of soup, and it was amazing too. The second time I got the kale = just okay. And I had the potato egg salad, and it was good at the first bite, but then it became not so good after every bite. Haha. I'd still come here for the Crunchy Chicken sandwich. Oh, the pretzel buns it comes on....oh so delicious. And get the chips. And get some soup if you want.
