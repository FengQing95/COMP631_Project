JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Tonkatsu spicy (hot). I thought the spice was perfect, though I added another spoonful of the spicy sauce. Broth was creamy with just enough spice. Mine came with the thick noodles-- I thought they were just a little too soft (if they took it out 2 min earlier it would've been perfect) but they were still good. I didn't really like the chasu. It was lean meat and cooked well but i like fat on my chasu! That's where the flavor is. I thought the meat was meh. I gave it to my boyfriend. I ordered an additional side of bamboo which I loved! They give fresh bamboo, not the canned, rectangular ones even though I like that too. Go jinya for having fresh bamboo!
