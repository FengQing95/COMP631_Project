JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the tonkatsu black (No. 1) with thick noodles.  Each menu item states the type of noodle that it is served with, but you can opt for which kind you'd like.  The broth was very rich and flavorful, and the noodles were cooked well.  A piece of my pork chashu was a bit tough and dry, but overall the meal was delicious.  Definitely one of the better spots to get ramen in Houston!
