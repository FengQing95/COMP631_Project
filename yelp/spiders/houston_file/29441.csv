The Pit Room////So disappointing. Recently moved back to TX and always in search of new BBQ to try. First off, the brisket was bone dry. Like desert dry. Like if I drop my phone in water and don't have rice handy I could put it in the brisket dry. I kept dunking it in the BBQ sauce (thankfully I got two cups) but even that didn't help.  Maybe if they asked if you wanted lean or fatty that would have helped but not sure. The jalapeño sausage was overcooked and somewhat dry as well. The mac and cheese was somewhere between regular Kraft mac and cheese and the deluxe shell version. I didn't even eat half my lunch. Won't be back. There are many other options that are so much better.
