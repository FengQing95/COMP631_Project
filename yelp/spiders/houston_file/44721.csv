Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The place is a little expensive. In Italy I can have this same amazing experience by spending at least one fifth of what I pay at Common Bond. But this is the only place I found in Houston in which I can have a real Italian/French/European style of breakfast, which makes me feel home. Therefore I'm ok to pay extra to tame my home-sick feelings.
