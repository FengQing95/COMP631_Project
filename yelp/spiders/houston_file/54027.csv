Kata Robata////Came here on a whim after being shooed out of another popular sushi restaurant for coming in close to their closing time. Kata Robata exceeded our expectations. The "rising sun" sushi roll with the truffle vinaigrette was not only innovative but delicious! The miso lobster mac and cheese was creamy and had a crispy and flaky crust. Steven Lo was our waiter and he was fantastic, super attentive and helpful with the menu. Thanks for giving us such a great experience!
