Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A great place for Breakfast!  Arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday and there was a long line but it was worth the wait.  Everything in the bakery looks fresh and delicious!   Their Croissant and macaroons are the best in town!  The cappuccino did not disappoint.  I would definitely come back for more!
