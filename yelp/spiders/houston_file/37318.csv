Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is great! Just moved in from California and was brought here by some friends and family. It's a great atmosphere, really cool sleek place. Had an amazing Bosscat burger and some even better service from Terry and James. Great place to have some good food and drinks with good company. Highly recommend coming here and checking out!
