Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Nice little spot tucked away in River Oaks, the food was absolutely wonderful (brick chicken), from explanation of drinks and dishes by Terry (ask for him when you're seated for fun and exemplary service) presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special whiskey drinks (Kentucky Orange Blossom will have you right after the first glass ).
