JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Shibin - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry we missed the perfect mark due to our wait times. Please know we try our hardest to keep the tables turning WITHOUT rushing customers along. But also believe me when I say that task is nearly impossible given the nature of our business where folks do like to hang out and socialize long after they've finished eating. Unfortunately, in these instances, there's little we can do. But thank you all the same, and we hope you'll visit us again soon (during off-peak hours!).
