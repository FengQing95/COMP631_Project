Local Foods////Local Foods will always have a spot in our hearts! We've been coming here since our pharmacy school days and have since moved to Dallas, but we always make it a priority to stop in for a quick lunch anytime we're back in Houston! Some notable favorite of ours include the Banh Mi, Truffled Egg Salad, and Smoked Salmon sandwiches! Also love the variety of sides you can choose from and always leave here with the biggest smiles on our faces! Can't wait till we're back again!
