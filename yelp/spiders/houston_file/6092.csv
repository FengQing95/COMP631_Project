JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the cozy ambiance of this place!!!! A group of friends went around 9:30 pm and it was pretty crowded. There was a wait but it was worth it. We started off with the Brussels sprouts tempura and it was PHENOMENAL. Get it. I had the vegetable soup ramen and it was just what I wanted. Plenty of flavor and a large serving I was doing my happy fat girl dance. I love food and I was 100% pleased with my visit at Jinya. Not to mention this was my first time. It's a really cute place for dinner dates, catching up with girlfriends etc
