Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Yoooooo the cocktails here are delish and the service here is FLAWLESS! Terry was our waiter today and he was so on top of everything, toured us thru the main menu and the whiskey menu. His personality was great and he definitely sold us on some of his recommendations. I tried the Bosscat burger and the sweet potato Mac & cheese. Get the burger the "chef's way" and you won't regret it, trust. Also the cocktails are full of flavor but also a good strength. The BC lemonade, the BC Sweet Tea, and the old fashioned were all perfect.
