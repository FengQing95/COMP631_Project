Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There is one thing I forgot to mention - The first time we went, I slipped as I was walking to the ladies' room, but I figured it was a fluke. However, we went again recently, and the same thing happened. I was wearing tennis shoes the first time and hiking boots the second so it was definitely the floor. I'm pregnant so it's especially worrisome. This is my *only* complaint.
