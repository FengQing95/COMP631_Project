Uchi////Underwhelming. I came here with two friends for dinner and drinks, and the entire experience was hit and miss. First we sat outside and waited for a table in their lovely patio area, where we were able to order drinks and appetizers. Uchi has an impressive imported Japanese beer and wine selection, and some fantastic starters-I highly recommend the edamame and fried hanna (cauliflower) and Kabocha.
