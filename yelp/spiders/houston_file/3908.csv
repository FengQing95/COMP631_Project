JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food itself at Jinya is amazing. The ramen, curry and jinya bun are a few favorites. My boyfriend and I try and come here at least once or twice every few weeks. The atmosphere, however, is a little uncomfortable. Most of the seating is very close to other tables or customers, and it is VERY loud. Don't expect to have a quiet conversation with your date. Good for young adults who don't mind noise and just want some really great food.
