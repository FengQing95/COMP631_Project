Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got takeout from Snooze while I was visiting Houston last weekend. We ordered online and picked up in the restaurant. The process was painless, and our order was ready when we arrived! I got the Egg White Scramble with avocado, red peppers, and soyrizo with hashbrowns - it was delicious! My boyfriend got the Spuds Deluxe with chicken sausage, ranchero, and scrambled eggs - he said it was really good. I wish I lived in Houston so I could become a regular here!
