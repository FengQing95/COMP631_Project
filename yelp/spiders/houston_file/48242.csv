Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend got the "Pancake Flight" - so she could choose 3 pancakes. She got classic buttermilk, Pumpkin, and Sweet Potato. The buttermilk you could get anywhere and shouldn't waste your choice on that, but that the sweet potato comes with a creative ginger butter :) very good!
