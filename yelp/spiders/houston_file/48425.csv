Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Albeit the extremely long wait times at snooze currently the food/experience was divine! I got the Bella Bella Benedict and our table shared the pineapple upside down pancake. Both of which were so amazing. The menu offers a wide variety of choices all sounding better than the last. Definitely worth that hour long wait!
