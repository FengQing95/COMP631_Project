Baby Barnaby's////Green eggs were delicious.   Many comment on them being "wet", but I think that's more from the cheese mixed in than the eggs being undercooked at all.  I found them to be delightful,  and I don't like wet scrambled eggs.  I thought the chicken sausage it comes with to be good as well.  There were tons of potatoes,  and they were fine.  Coffee was very good too, and I like that they leave a small carafe of it on your table.
