Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband and I have been eager to try this place out and all I can say is I'm not sure why we didn't visit earlier. A large part of our life is spent trying various restaurants and critiquing all of the little details. This place has all figured out.  We feel that service is a large part of the success of an establishment and as soon as we were seated our waiter Dan greeted us with enthusiasm. He shared various details about several menu items and helped us navigate drinks and menu item thoroughly and with extreme passion. He knew the menu well and was able to convey his love for each item we asked about.  It was as if he owned the restaurant...this doesn't always happen. Some servers/bartenders are just there to pass the time. The food was excellent,flavorful and not boring. We cannot wait to return with friends. Thank you Dan for making our experience 5 star.
