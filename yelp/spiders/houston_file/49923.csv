Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Caveat: (forgive me for this pun) if you snooze, you'll lose, as the wait just increases as the day goes on at Snooze.  We tried going another Saturday at 9:00 a.m., and there was a 1 hour 15 minute wait.  This time (on a Saturday), we arrived a little before 7:30 a.m., and there was *still* a 10 minute wait. (And when we left around 8:15, the line was out the door.)
