Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This breakfast is so delicious, it feels sinful. Well, considering that I kept eating far beyond the point of satiation, I guess I did sin. But, gluttony is by FAR worth having to ask forgiveness for. Lol I've never not had anything I didn't like. If you're an indecisive foodie like me, try the pancake flight--and don't be deceived by the name of it--you can include French toast as one of the three you try. It's worth the wait and the calories! But, make sure you have absolutely nothing to do after. Cause you'll definitely need a nap! Lol I now know why it's called snooze .
