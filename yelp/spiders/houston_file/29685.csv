The Pit Room////I went with the 2 meat dinner and I was stuffed half way through. I chose the beef sausage and the brisket... There were 3 different types of sausages that day, beef, venison and pork with jalapenos and cheese. I understand all these sausages are made in house. And oh goodness they are delicious. As my sides I chose the elote and the special side of the day which was charred green beans. A wise choice all the way around.
