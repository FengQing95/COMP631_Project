Kata Robata////However the slow service and lack of parking do make this an inconvenient place to go at times. At lunch time, the lot gets PACKED, and there are at least 4 cars at all times circling the lot and fighting for a spot when one opens up. I would suggest the restaurant either offers valet parking or at least has clear signage about where to park if the lot is full. Last time I was there, we weren't able to find a spot, so we parked across the street at Pico's (also a great restaurant by the way...) There were no signs that said we couldn't park there and we did not get towed, but it would be nice if they could ensure parking where we know we will not get towed. (When we asked the staff if it is okay to park at Pico's, they weren't sure).
