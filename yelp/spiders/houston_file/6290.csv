JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fantastic ramen, their portions are a tad smaller than other places I've tried both here in Houston and over in Austin, but the flavor of just the broth alone threw that concern out the window. I tried the chef special ramen that had fried chicken in it. You can also get pretty funky meat bowls with all sorts of options like quinoa and beans in it.
