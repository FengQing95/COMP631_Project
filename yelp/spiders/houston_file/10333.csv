JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While the ramen was great, the real highlight of JINYA was definitely the extensive list of traditional ramen toppings!  You can stick to the basics or create your own Frankenstein bowl for just a couple extra bucks.  Our only gripe was that they were skimpy with the Bok Choy - surprising since the other orders of toppings were very substantial.
