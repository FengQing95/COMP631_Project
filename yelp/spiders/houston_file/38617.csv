Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I thought I'd give at least the food at Bosscat another chance and did takeout.  The hostesses were just as indifferent as they were last time, though the food was pretty good.  The Bosscat burger was a hit, and I really liked their fries with special ketchup.  The red velvet churros were very good too.
