JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Meant to write this review when I went a few weeks ago. Went to Jinya with two friends and got the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen. Was super delicious and reminded me of the ramen I had when I went to Japan.  I've went elsewhere in Houston that had overcooked somen and pork in the broth and strange garnishes like a lettuce leaf, so needless to say, Jinya's was a happy find.  The staff was helpful, present but not overbearingly so. Lots of young staff and very friendly. We sat at the big table in the middle where other parties were also seated together on the side of us. The seating arrangement is interesting, and I imagine it can get very crowded on weeknights.
