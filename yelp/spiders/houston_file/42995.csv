Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My recommendation: prep enough fruit croissants to last more than 4hrs and improve the behaviors and manners of the staff; just because your customers don't always look like a million bucks, doesn't mean they don't have a million bucks. They're more than happy to take their business elsewhere.
