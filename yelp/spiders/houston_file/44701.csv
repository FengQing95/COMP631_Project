Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm giving Common Bond 5 stars because they were really quick to get me to the front of the line to place my order, got my food out quickly and was in a really beautiful, chill environment.   I was really eying the desserts and pastries.  I already am working on a place to get back to Common Bond soon so I can enjoy the decadent items!
