The Pit Room////(!) SERVICE & TIDBITS: We couldn't finish the whole thing and so I stumbled over to the counter. The cashier saw that look in my eye--she must see it all too often--and said, "Ya need a to-go box, huh? I saw it in your eyes!" I gladly obliged, and once we got back to our apt several hours later we heated and enjoyed the best leftovers we ever had.
