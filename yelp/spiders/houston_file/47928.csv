Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I absolutely loved my first food experience at Snooze. We arrived at 10 am on a Saturday, and there was an hour and 15 minutes wait. I've become accustomed to restaurants that take reservations, so I was surprised and sad snooze didn't, especially with the amount of traffic and limited space they have. Once our time had gone by, we got the text our table was ready. On the way, we were approach by people from a newspaper with a promotion.... Long story short - we got two free mimosas!  Now, the food. Everything looked amazingly delicious. I am a French toast aficionado, and must say - these are pretty high on my list!! The OMG French toast (sans coconut) made you literally say OHHHHMYYGOD.... repeatedly... Until the meal is done. That was freakin' edible heaven. I also got the 2 eggs with cheese/hashbrowns/bacon plate.... Which was also perfect. Don't judge me. I was hungry  and I ate all of it and had another mimosa! The meal was DEFINITELY happy-dance worthy, and I did bust a couple moves, as I always do when I'm happy with what I'm eating... The staff were real nice, and our server was very attentive. I had about an inch of French toast left on my plate, asked for a box (just to see his reaction) and he was really going to go get me a box.  He was nice.... Everything was great!  But that 1.15 hour wait with no reservation option, in the HEAT... That was brutal, and a factor that may make me rethink returning soon... But I'm sure I'll be back eventually.
