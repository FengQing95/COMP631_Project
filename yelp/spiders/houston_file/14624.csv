JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually get the No. 1 Tonkotsu Black but decided I wanted a little less pork and a little more chicken tonight so I got the spicy chicken, with my spice level as, well spicy. I generally can't handle too much spicy but I've been trying to change my tastebuds to tolerate more spice. It's working slowly but surely so far.
