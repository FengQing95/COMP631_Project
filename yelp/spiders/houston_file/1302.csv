JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Marie - Thanks for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate your kind words and the bird's-eye view of a nearly decimated plate of Crispy Shrimp Balls. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. But perhaps most importantly, I appreciate your understanding on the wait times. On busy nights, we try our best to move things along as quickly, but also as slowly, as we can. These nights are never easy for our front OR back of house, so I'm always glad to know the quality of our food is valued as such. We look forward to seeing you again soon!
