Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////However, service quality was a bit off today. When we came in the restaurant, we stood at the front for maybe 5-10 minutes just waiting before there was actually a server to put my friend and I on the waiting list. There was no worker to organize the line, so many of us were clustered at the front not knowing what to do. Not a deal breaker, but just something to point out. Food quality is still most important and glad Snooze gets it right!
