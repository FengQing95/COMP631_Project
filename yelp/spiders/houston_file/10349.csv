JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is what my friend said about me: "I'm sure you must have entered right when the doors opened for the soft opening to try out the food and Yelp about it." HA. Wrong. I wanted to give them more time to get into the swing of things and present a better product. I'd feel too mean tearing them apart if it's the first day, you know?
