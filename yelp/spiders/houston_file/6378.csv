JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hands-down some of the best ramen I've eaten. Amazing choices for toppings (who knew Brussels sprouts could be so good in ramen?!) and the restaurants have a great atmosphere. I love that you can order takeout without losing any of the food quality, too! Highly recommend.
