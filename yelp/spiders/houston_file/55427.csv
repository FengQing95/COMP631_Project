Kata Robata////First time ever going. Gotta keep this one short. If you get a chance and you're near Kirby and 610..make it a point to get there. I've been trying to get back since I left there. Staff was great...food was great..not your average sushi experience...I'll be back soon...Get in...Get out...enjoy
