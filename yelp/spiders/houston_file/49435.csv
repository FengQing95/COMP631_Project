Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The parking lot is small and we had to wait for someone to leave to get a spot. I would say this is nothing special and is just a small breakfast place with underwhelming food. Â I prefer The Egg and I which has a better and more extensive menu. My spouse did like his French toast but it was fancy French toast with marscapone cheese as they didn't have just regular French toast.
