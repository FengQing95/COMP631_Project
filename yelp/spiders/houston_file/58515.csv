Baby Barnaby's////My husband and I could not decide what to rate Baby Barnaby's, I was going to say 4 stars, he wanted 5. Â The only reason I wanted to give it a 4 was the coffee was weak and watery, just overall not good. However, because the breakfast was so phenomenal we decided to go with 5. The pancakes were amazing. The potatoes were perfect and my biscuits were delicious! Can't wait to go back!
