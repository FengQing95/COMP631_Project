Baby Barnaby's////Baby barnaby's is my favorite go to brunch spot. I always get the same thing because I'm convinced there's nothing more delicious on the menu. GREEN EGGS!! It's a breakfast version of that spinach artichoke dip you can't stop snacking on. The dish comes with plenty of crispy potatoes, toast and chicken apple sausage. Their fresh squeezed OJ is another must order item! The only drawback is the wait time. They don't take reservations and they are incredibly popular. I went at 10:15 am on Sunday and for the first time ever did not have to wait to be seated. Around 10:30 am I noticed people putting their name on the list so get there early or be prepared to chill on the patio outside starving. Bonus- they have California artwork all over the interior walls which reminds me of when I lived in San Francisco. I usually bring visitors here and they are never disappointed.
