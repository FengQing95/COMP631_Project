Uchi////The bf and I came on a Thursday night for reservations at 7:15. I was told to order the server's menu and that's what we did. Basically, the waiter will ask you what you like/dislike and the range you are looking to spend. What a great idea! :) Appetizers/sushi/veggies are brought out one after the other and you are to tell the waiter when you are 75% full so that they can slow down the amount of food that's coming or stop bringing it.
