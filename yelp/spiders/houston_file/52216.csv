Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After waiting for so long I hoped my food would be at least warm and fresh, but instead my omelette was cold, my partner's eggs were as well, and they gave her the completely wrong sides. The only redeeming quality was the pancake i got on the side was pretty decent, but also not very warm. I've heard great things about this place in the past so not sure what happened, but not sure I'll be rushing back anytime soon.
