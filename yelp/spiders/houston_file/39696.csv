Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Once we sat which we had a reservation at 730 we were ignored most of the night. We sat right between the private room and the kitchen.  Our waiter was "too busy" or we weren't really his concern.  I expect that since he was guaranteed the 18% the service was NOT his top priority.  Our table was reserved only until 930 but this gentleman wouldn't take out order until about 830, the wait was long and plates were brought 2-3 at a time and mine was last, good 10 min after the first plates.  We felt rushed at that point so did not really enjoyed the experience.
