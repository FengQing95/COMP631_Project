Uchi////I came to eat here with some co-workers. I have been wanting to eat here for the longest time ever. The experience was worth the wait. I can't remember everything we had but all I know is that it was all delicious, especially the Brussels sprouts. Service is great. The fried milk dessert was amazing. Ambiance was nice. It was really busy for a weeknight. Valet is complimentary. I would definitely be back with my husband in tow.
