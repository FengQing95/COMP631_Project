Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait was not very long to get seated, granted it was a Monday...but there was a steady flow of people. Our waiter, Darius did a wonderful job mixing some perfect juice drinks for us, and the food so worth it!! I ordered the plain blueberry pancake and it was plenty. My mom ordered egg tacos (Juan's - can't remember the whole name) and they were incredible. Amazing service and atmosphere, sad I didn't try the coffee, but I will next time!!
