Kata Robata////We had a reservation for 8 and our server turned out to be our old friend Susan (it was her birthday too)!  She remembered me from the days of when I used to visit from Cincinnati and go to Azuma.  The service was crazy fast -  we were still mid-ordering and they have an electronic system, so as Susan put in our orders, the food was showing up at our table so fresh!
