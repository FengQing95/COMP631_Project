Uchi////The food has never disappointed me. Every single time I'm here, I make sure to get nasu nigiri, avocado nigiri, machi cure, a couple a large hot sakes, and the fried milk dessert. The rest of what I eat while I'm here will vary depending on how recent my last visit was and what I got those times. If you go here enough, you'll have tried all, if not most, of the menu. It's a possibility this place might lose its "wow" factor to your taste buds.
