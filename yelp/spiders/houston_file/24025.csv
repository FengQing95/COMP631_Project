Uchi////As it was sake social time, my boyfriend and I got some drinks: takara nigori and kara kyuri.  Homeboi had like 3 kara kyuri's that night... he can not only drink, but we can attest that it did taste really good: light and refreshing.  We also ordered the negi hama futomaki, which was a small sushi roll and one that I particularly enjoyed.  Had a nice flavour and crunch.  We also ordered some of the brussel sprouts, which we had last time and were pleasantly surprised by.  Has a nice, umami flavour with a bit of char.  When you think of brussel sprouts they sound really... unappetizing, for a lack of better words, but this dish is really good.
