JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- Premium Tonkotsu White ($11.95): The flavor of the Chicken and Pork Broth really had a punch in this one, it literally dived into my mouth with every sip. Their Pork Chashu was very tender and packed with a mild, salty sweet flavor. The green onions, egg, and fried onions was well made with the Ramen, only exception was the wood ears which were really rough to chew on. Last issue I'd like to mention is that the broth I had was a lot saltier than what I would've preferred.
