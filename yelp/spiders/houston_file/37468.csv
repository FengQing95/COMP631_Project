Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very delicious food and fast seating (even at brunch time!!) call ahead for reservations if unsure of wait time. Not many veggie/vegan options and mainly caters to savory dishes with meat as the centerpiece. Great mimosa carafes and other drinks. Would recommend Boss Fries! Best wedges ever.
