JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kaitlyn - Thank you for bringing this to my attention. We are more than happy to remedy this for you. I am currently testing all of our broths at our Midtown location to make sure we didn't have a bad batch. For the record, we go through so much broth, noodles and toppings that none of our ingredients "sit out in the restaurant most of the day."
