Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food, the coffee and the staff are great, but watch where and when you park. I had dinner here Friday night with a good friend that I was catching up with. We were in the middle of a conversation when we were asked to leave at close. We walked across the street, so we could continue talking. When we walked back to our cars, they were gone! We were confused for a minute until we realized we had been towed. What was supposed to be a relaxing evening for both of us ended up being very expensive and stressful as we got our cars out of impound, late at night, in a bad part of town. For those of you like me who may not know the area, I wanted to warn to be careful where you park - and make sure you move your car after close.
