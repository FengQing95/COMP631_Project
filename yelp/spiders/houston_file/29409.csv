The Pit Room////Ribs however were great!! I went to two other bbq joints that day and The Pit Room really stood out. It's served as a dry rub and the spices cutting through the sauce was a different but good experience. I'm not a big fan of pouring sauce over my ribs after they have been barbecued (I like my sauce cooked on and thick). But a minor inconvenience for me. There's ample seating inside as well which is nice. Overall a good spot but 4 stars because nothing blew my mind.
