Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////3 out of 4 times I have been were good experiences. Very cute decor and concept, love the design of their packaging for to-go pastries and macaroon boxes. Best croissants and very good vanilla latte with almond milk. Try the passionfruit macaroon and the bread plate during brunch. Be sure to get there before they stop serving brunch or they will not make menu items for you, we were 5 minutes late one time and they refused to serve the bread plate saying "we do not have a slicer". Of course you have a slicer, this is a bakery. Come up with a better excuse or say that since we arrived 5 minutes after service is stopped you will not serve us, not because you don't have a bread slicer. Also, the ridiculously long line is worth the wait.
