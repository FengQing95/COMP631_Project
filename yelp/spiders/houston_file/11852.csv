JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not bad, but I've had better. Somehow I've yet to top the twin ramen genius of Tamashii and Goro in Oklahoma city of all places. Nothing tops the tonkotsu garlic or the spicy ground pork at either of those places. Also, the vibe here is trendy pretty people rather than fun. A little snooty for a down and dirty fat boy snack like ramen.
