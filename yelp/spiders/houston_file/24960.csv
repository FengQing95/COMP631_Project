Uchi////This was our first time trying Uchi and we were very impressed! We went for the sake social hour that begins at 5pm. Our server gave us great recommendations from the daily specials and sake hour menus, and even brought us complimentary Brussels sprouts! We ended dinner with the famous fried milk dessert and it was delicious. There is complimentary parking in the back which is very helpful as there is limited street parking in the area.
