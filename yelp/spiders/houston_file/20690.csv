Uchi////Hotate (raw) - A fresh diver scallop on top of avocado, and possibly a tiny bed of rice I'm not sure. My cousins favorite dish that I didn't really prefer. Again I'm a textures person when I eat my food and the raw scallop wasn't doing it for me. Other then the raw scallop, the rest of it is normal sushi fair.
