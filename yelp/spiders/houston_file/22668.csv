Uchi////Menu is split into "tastings" (hot and cold - mostly fish, with some poultry and beef Â shout outs - range from $7, for mackerel b/c no one but me likes it, to the mid-$20s - portions are ample - usually 5-6 slices of fish), sushi/sashimi (priced per piece for the sush - usually around $2.5-5), maki, agemono (aka, fried delights - which I think are less than $7/order), and of course salady/soupy things.
