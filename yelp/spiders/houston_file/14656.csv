JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Added note: Service was prompt, I would assume it is because the restaurant was not super busy at the time I was there, but it was appreciated. As well, learned that outside of parking on the street, the nearby parking structure 2nd floor is also free to park during the afternoon.
