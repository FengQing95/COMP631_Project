Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I tried the Bravacado toast ($12.50) with poached eggs, as well as the sweet potato pancakes. I can attest that Snooze knows how to cook eggs properly, but I pretty much ordered the dish to eat avacado, and amount of actual avacado on the toast just made me sad. The salad was nice and paired well with the dish, the "rustic bread" (AKA, toast) was sourdough-ish, and the garlic oil was definitely a very tasty finishing touch. But the avacado component was a mere thin layer in addition to with a few small chunks on top of the bread, a bit like if someone had spread avacado on the toast the same way you do jelly. If the reason it's called Bravacado toast is because they're being brave with trying to get away with giving as little avacado as possible, then it is named quite aptly.
