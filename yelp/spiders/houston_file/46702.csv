Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1. We asked for both of our pastries to be heated. They were both placed, as usual, in a non-commercial broiler oven, which does not work. The food was served less than lukewarm. We ask that it be reheated, and even so, it was reserved not warmed to a level that any reasonable person would expect. I told the server that it was disappointing that the oven didn't work, and she said "I know!" Â We have actually promised ourselves that we were never coming back to this restaurant - and told the management so - as a result of this one thing, but alas we decided to give them another try and, alas once again we were disappointed. Can't they invest 50 bucks in a new broiler oven, especially since they're hell-bent on not having a commercial level oven to heat their products?
