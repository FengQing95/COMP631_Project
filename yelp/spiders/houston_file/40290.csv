Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Donut burger: 2/5. I was really looking forward to this but I was honestly underwhelmed. It was supposed to be a sweet and savory dish but I felt more like I was eating patties with a little chocolate sauce on top. The donuts had a chocolate glaze (only the top bun) and it came with two patties, cheese, bacon, and an egg. I thought it was too meaty and would be better if there was less patty and more sweet.
