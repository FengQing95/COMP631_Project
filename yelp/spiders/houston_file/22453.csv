Uchi////I had been to uchi multiple times.  It has been great until today.  The quality of the fish is not there anymore, the rice is horrible and taste like regular HEB sushi rice.  The rice grain is harder than normal sushi.  The new menu cut off several items from old and some got new receipe.  I wonder their sushi crew got changed too.
