Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat gets a 5 star rating for service, but a 3/4 star rating for food. First timers here, nice atmosphere, good music that wasn't too loud, and the service was really great. We went late so there were a few things already sold out on the menu, but that's to be expected with certain items layer in the day. We ordered the barbecue salmon, which the bf really liked, the sweet potato Mac & cheese, which was pretty good, and the open face turkey sandwich, which I couldn't get past three bites of, it was just off. We also had the red velvet churros, which were really good too. I wouldn't be opposed to going back to try something else, but definitely won't be eating the turkey sandwich again. And, there's fruity pebbles French toast on their brunch menu and I'm 99.9% sure I need that in my life.
