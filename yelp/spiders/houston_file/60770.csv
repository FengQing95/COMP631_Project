Baby Barnaby's////Loving the food, not so much the service. I came here for a Saturday morning brunch. When you walk in, you have to sign your name on a pad of paper stuck to the wooden pole on the porch. About 12 groups were in front of us, and we were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Instead, we only had to wait about 5 minutes (YES!) because the people in front of us had all left. We ended up sitting outside on their porch, which was pretty lovely (besides the Mosquitos).
