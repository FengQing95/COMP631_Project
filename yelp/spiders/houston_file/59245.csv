Baby Barnaby's////Everything is very reasonably priced and cheaper than your average chain. I had Huevos Rancheros w/ scrambled eggs. It wasn't mind blowing or anything but very, very satisfactory. Esther got steak and eggs w/ biscuits ($7.50!!!). The steak was surprisingly delicious. It is very thin but the charring made it really flavorful and awesome. She had originally asked for toast but got biscuits instead. Thank goodness. The biscuits were amazing-- very fluffy, buttery, not too dry, overall delicious. They have a cool orange juice squeezing machine that tricked us into ordering $2.50 tiny glasses of OJ. Worth it though...
