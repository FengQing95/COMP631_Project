Local Foods////Sandwiches, which all average around $10, come with your choice of soup (the selection changes seasonally) or two sides. I settled with the crunchy chicken sandwich (without yelphelp) with couscous and cabbage slaw for sides. Mom got falafel with chicken posole soup, and Dad the smoked salmon bagel sandwich with chilled tomato soup.
