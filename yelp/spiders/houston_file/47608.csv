Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////3. Sweet Potato Pancakes/Upsidedown Pineapple Pancake - One of the best pancake selections in Houston with the Sweet Potato and Upsidedown Pineapple pancake coming out to an even draw. The Pineapple pancake of course sounds awesome, but the Sweet Potato pancake is the surprise selection in their pancake menu. If I had to choose only 1 it'd be the Sweet Potato, but if you're indecisive get one of each and be sure to ask what their pancake of the day is. Sometimes it's awesome...sometimes it's wtf really? (i.e.fajita pancake) Just ask.
