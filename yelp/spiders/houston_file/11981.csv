JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One bowl alone was enough to be fulfilled. The ramen also came out fairly quickly and I highly appreciated the fact that it wasn't boiling hot! It was the most ideal temperature to dive right in. I don't think any other ramen places are able to top my expectations after this visit.
