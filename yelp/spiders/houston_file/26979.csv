The Pit Room////Ate lunch here today around 2:00pm. Light to medium crowd, so we got our food pretty much instantaneously, and we ordered the Feast No.1 for 4-6 people. The folks who work here were super friendly. Gave us the tip that we can also take our food over to The Patio next door to eat and enjoy their full array of beers on tap. Good to know next time I want to catch a game somewhere.
