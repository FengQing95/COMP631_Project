Uchi////Came here for Father's Day dinner and ordered the 10 course chef's tasting + 3 rolls from the social hour menu. Taste and appearance of each and all of the dishes were spectacular. A bit more expensive ($171) than we had expected, but it was great quality food for a special occasion! Wait staff was attentive. When there was a slight miscommunication, they comped the dish in question. 3 social hour rolls were also delicious---particularly the ham and eggs.
