JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Upon entering, I was suppose to be greeted by the hostess but instead of greeting, I had more of an attitude...which I am not sure why but she seem like she hates her job. She was rude overall and very unfriendly. I deducted two stars for that because that literally ruined the rest of my time there.
