Local Foods////Went to local foods last Saturday for the first time and will definitely be coming back again. I had the vegan taco salad which was absolutely amazing whether you're a vegan or not. The portions were quite large and satisfying. The only down side to this place is the parking. We went around 1 and even though they have a parking lot, it was completely full since they share it with other restaurants. Definitely recommend it though, all the ingredients are very fresh and tasty!
