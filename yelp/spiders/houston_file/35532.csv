Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My 5* = Greatest place I've ever been. 4* = places that are great and I'd happily be a regular. This is firmly one of those. My group shared a lot of appetizers. Poutine and pulled pork hush puppies were group favorites. The hostess situation was a little awkward, but the rest of the service was on point. The whiskey set up looks amazing and I'm eager to go back for a tasting.
