JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Leah - I'm glad you enjoyed the taste of our food, but am sorry for your experience at JINYA. Almost all of our food contains gluten, largely because we use soy sauce in many of our recipes. The Tokyo Curry Rice contains a bevy of ingredients, including peeled apples, and also a Japanese curry mix, which does have wheat flour. However, we DO NOT add flour directly to our curry to thicken it. Regardless, I'm glad you were able to seek medical attention, and I'm assuming the hospital you visited performed the necessary tests to determine this was a gluten-allergy reaction. We will forward any and all diagnostics to our insurance carrier who will do all they can to assist you. I will be sending you a private message with my contact information, as well. Again, I do apologize for your experience, and to our knowledge this is the first time since opening JINYA-NASA in October 2015 that we've had a customer experience a gluten-allergy issue with any of our food.
