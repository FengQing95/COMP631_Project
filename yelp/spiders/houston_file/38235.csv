Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Love love love this place!!! Interior is gorgeous! Rustic, chic, open, and plenty of lighting. The staff was warm, welcoming, and extremely knowledgeable.  The food was extremely tasteful and the portion  sizes were perfect. It's comfort food so it's dense but delicious. Dessert was also incredible. We had the chocolate pudding and red velvet churros - straight mouthwatering delish! Caesar was our waiter so big shout out to him for providing an amazing experience. I love that this place is clean, welcoming, open, and delicious. The ambiance is a classy chill vibe. You feel at home here, but like a fancy home where Alfred is ready to please ;)
