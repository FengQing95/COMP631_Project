Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been to Snooze 3 times prior to my visit today. So I have had a great bases for the review I'm about to leave. I understand that it is very customary to experience a long wait and was prepared to do so. I even agreed with the hostess when she mentioned the wait was worth it because the food is that good. I remarked true.
