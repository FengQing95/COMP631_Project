Uchi////First time here and what a wonderful experience.  The wait was not bad and while we waited we hanged out at the bar.  Try to get seated in front of chefs as it's really fascinating to see them prepare your meal fresh in front of you.  Food was yummy and dessert was just outstanding. Will come again
