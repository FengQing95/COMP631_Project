Uchi////We've been to Uchi Dallas many times in the past few years and have had a wonderful experience at that restaurant. Our Brussel sprouts were not served one time and the manager at the Dallas location, Mike, was an absolute professional in his handling of the situation and as a result of our great customer experience we had turned Uchi into our go to date night restaurant.
