Local Foods////Perhaps I am just not refined enough to appreciate this restaurant but I found the food here to be solidly mediocre. I got the crunchy chicken sandwich with the lemon chicken soup. The chicken is was kind of dry with limited flavor. It genuinely just tasted like a plain chicken sandwich. I like food to be more flavorful and this just didn't taste that way to me. I didn't really get much of a crunch either. The pretzel bun however was absolutely delicious.
