JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen here is too salty, greasy, and overpriced. I got the cha cha cha, which is apparently for garlic lovers, but the broth did not tastes anything like garlic. Instead it was salty and bitter from the ginger flavor. Also, I had to pay extra 50 cents to make it spicy. What the heck??
