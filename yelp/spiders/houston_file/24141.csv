Uchi////I can see how this would upset the staff - bartenders and servers since they work for tip. But take it upon management and not your customers. You are at your job and should be professional, especially at a high end establishment like this one. Being at the bar, we were met with unfriendly unprofessional staff. They were talking among each other and made it loud enough so that the customers at the bar could hear.  Bar staff and server on 11/11/2017 listen up. We heard your "Aren't you glad Happy Hour is over?!" We'll choose not to take that shift! We also heard your "These spots should be clear soon - these people have been waiting forever" and the snarky "Thanks" telling the server thank you for talking loud enough so that we get the point to leave.  I'm sorry you think that paying customers do not have the right to sit in their seats until they're done eating and drinking. I'm sorry you don't think you'll make enough tips from us - even though we did rack up a tab of almost $200 from ordering food and drinks - easily more than the normal patron depending on what they order on the normal menu. Your attitude and unprofessionalism is probably why you don't make tips period.
