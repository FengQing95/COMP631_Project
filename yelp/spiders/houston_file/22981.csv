Uchi////The food is always changing and always unique.  I would definitely save the tasting menus for special occasions and don't just do the traditional one, do the tasting menu of the day as the menu changes almost every week and it's fun to see what the chef is up to.  Although they don't necessarily pair the tasting menu with wine, we asked them to do during an anniversary and they brought out 5 beer/wine/cider pairings that were perfect with our meal.  The happy hour is very reasonable and allows you to try everything - suggest coming here with 4 people and literally just order one of everything on the menu; I think I did this once and it was only $30/person.  The service is always impeccable and food is consistent.  The only downside is who hard it is to get a reservation here even on week days, which shows how consistently good Uchi is.
