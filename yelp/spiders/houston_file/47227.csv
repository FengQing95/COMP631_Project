Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Delicious and unique menu items, great service and great place to take out of town guests.  The only only draw back is the wait.  Sometimes its ridiculous so we end up having to go somewhere else.  But when we dine at Snooze our bellies are content and we most definitely need a Snooze after.
