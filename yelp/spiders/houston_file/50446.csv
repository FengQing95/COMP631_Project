Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They have amazing drinks at the bar (if you're into morning drinking, lol). I had their screwdriver spin-off (so good), their house blend coffee with Michael's (same thing as Bailey's, but cheaper), and an orange mimosa. They have a whole bunch of flavors for their mimosas (orange, mango, peach, strawberry, etc). And it's a pretty great serving for only $6. COUNT ME IN!
