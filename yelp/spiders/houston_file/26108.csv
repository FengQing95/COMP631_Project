The Pit Room////I've got the meat-sweats right now! I went in with a group and got the #2 Combo, which feeds 6-8 people. We had: beef ribs, pork ribs, turkey, spicy sausage, brisket and a boatload of sides. There were 8 of us with appetites, so we added an extra dinosaur-sized beef rib and another pound of brisket. I didn't care for the cole slaw, but everything else was fantastic! Juicy, well-seasoned meats, great saut√©ed okra, spicy baked beans, tangy potato salad and an awesome relish bar with all sorts of pickled things and house made yummy sauces. You might as well call me Arnold because, "I'll be baaaack!"
