The Pit Room////Tough decision between four and five stars for this place. Honestly I think they deserve five stars for their integrity!! I had the brisket, pork sausage, mac & cheese, and some pickled goodies. Everything was very good! I guess I could criticize the dysfunctional ordering system. But it's not that bad considering the place is jam packed. (it was standing room only when I was there today). Not trying to be a snob but the pickles were just OK. I mean I tried three different things (scallion, onion, cucumber) Unfortunately I didn't really feel that they accentuated the dish as much as they possibly could. But that is truly just one Californian's idea/opinion. Would I go back?..., for sure. Should you go give it a try, for sure! Â Good job down in the Pit!
