Local Foods////The Duck Confit sandwich left a bit to be desired.  The cranberry topping was a bit overpowering and I would have preferred strips of duck rather than duck that kind of reminded me of meatloaf.  I would recommend trying a different sandwich but I have seen many people rave on Yelp about the Duck Confit, I just was not seeing the appeal.
