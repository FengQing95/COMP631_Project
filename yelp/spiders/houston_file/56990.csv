Kata Robata////Second, came the Kagoshima Wagyu sushi.  Now to remind you, I don't eat sushi nor hardly know anything when it comes to sushi or ordering it.  Sadly enough, out came one Sushi...bummer haha.  However, I can honestly say the taste and texture of this sushi is definitely worth it.  Literally just melts in your mouth.  The first bite you understand that the Wagyu isn't just any ordinary type of meat.  Would I order it again, eh, I may, but I'm a simple man.  Give me a steak and I'm satisfied.
