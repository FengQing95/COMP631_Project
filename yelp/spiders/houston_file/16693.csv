JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food is also amazing. Because I didn't have high hopes for the ramen, I ordered dumplings, chicken pieces, and a salad as a back up. The dumpling were incredible, not too oily and not rubbery like others. The chicken pieces were crisp and savory. The salad with ginger dressing was a great starter. I was already satisfied. When my spicy pork ramen (I forget the real name) arrived, I took a sip of the broth and was pleased with the flavor. Then I tasted the noodles and I was super impressed. It wasn't that spicy for me since I ordered the second tier of spice, however, I asked my waiter to bring me hot sauce and that definitely completed my dish. Oh and I also had a lychee monitor! And that was refreshing and tasty!
