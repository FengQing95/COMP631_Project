Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////FOOD: Definite fluffy, buttery layers in that croissant. There was a good amount of almond paste in the middle and it was a good size. Not the cheapest croissant, but I didn't feel cheated from my money, which is always good. The Kouign Amman... wow. Caramelized goodness on top of the more dense, buttery layers in it. It sort of reminded me of a cruffin (a croissant donut) but with a layer of caramelized sugar around it. Pain Perdu was unique. I liked it a lot but it was definitely filling. SO. FILLING. It's made up of 3 triangular pieces of bread (no clue how it was all custardy inside even with the strange bread shape) and I loved the sauce and cream it came with. All in all, food is good. Delicious. What have you. Well, I can't say much for the savory dishes they offer, but from what I tasted, they get two thumbs up!
