Uchi////My previous experience was sitting at the wine bar, where the pace was extremely fast and the service quite excellent. This review is for a seated dinner in the beautiful main dining area. After what would have been a long wait were it not for sake and good company (the little amuses served on the patio were a thoughtful treat), I joined new friends at the table. Reservations seem like a great idea here, but I never let that stand in the way for my quest for tasty things.
