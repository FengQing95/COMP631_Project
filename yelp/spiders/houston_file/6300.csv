JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'd like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to myself for not coming here sooner. I pledge to never deprive myself of JINYA ever again. In fact, all the political protestors in the world should take a break and realize there are more important issues in society than confederate statues, police brutality, and gender equality. They need to focus their efforts on REAL awareness. JINYA awareness. Let's get back to the Ramen. Let's get back to the noodles.
