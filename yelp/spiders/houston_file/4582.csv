JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as our ramen goes, I'm sorry you do not consider our fare authentic. JINYA was founded by Tomonori Takahashi, who owns several restaurants in Ebisu, Japan. He brought the JINYA concept to the U.S. several years ago. As a JINYA franchise, we try to make the taste of our ramen as authentic as possible, following ultra-specific guidelines founded by Mr. Takahashi. It's possible you received a bowl that simply missed the mark. Should you change your mind and visit us again, please ask for me or any of my managers and we will make sure you receive a bowl of ramen that meets your every expectation.
