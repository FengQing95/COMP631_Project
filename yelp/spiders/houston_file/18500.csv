Uchi////Rolls: Ham/Egg Roll was amazing.  At first I was a bit surprised at the name of the roll, but it was crispy pork belly in a roll with some type of egg sauce, and if this was a breakfast item somewhere it would be the next breakfast place like Breakfast Klub's Chicken & Waffles.  Common, PORK BELLY. YOM!  Also had the Wagyu Beef Roll, and of course it was delicious; there really isn't anything bad when it comes to wagyu beef.
