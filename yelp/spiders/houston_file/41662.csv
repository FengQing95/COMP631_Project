Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So not worth the hype! This place is way too hip for Montrose and is still debating whether they are a bakery or not. I went there on a Saturday morning for coffee and croissant and was surprised to see they didn't open till 9:00... OK. Then, I queued for good 20 minutes until they opened and proceeded inside. Not a lot of flair, just modern and cold. The bread and croissant display was fantastic and to sample their goodies I ordered a fruit croissant, an almond croissant and a "kugelhop"(I split with a friend). Also ordered a cappuccino. So the skinny on their pastries: sugar bombs. Fruit croissant had a thick pistachio paste and half a strawberry to justify the name, the kugelhop was just sugary and overtly sweet and the almond croissant was missing the almonds. The cappuccino took 15 minutes to arrive and it wasn't anything to write home about.
