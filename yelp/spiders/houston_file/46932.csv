Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pay close attention to the reviews that speak to the subpar food. I'm not sure how one ruins breakfast, but my one and only experience here included just that. I went last Saturday morning around 7:45. I'd seen the ridiculous lines and didn't want any part of it. My timing was great as there was no wait. A server that I absolutely loved at another restaurant stopped by my table and we talked for awhile before she took my & my friend's drink orders. A couple of minutes after she stepped away, a different server came to the table and said while the server we knew had let her know of our acquaintance, she...not the young lady we knew, would be our server. The intense attitude dripping from her words should have been an indication of what was to come. She brought our drinks and started to explain the menu...except she was talking at us & not to us. She spoke only of dishes that she liked and cut us off whenever we tried to speak. We finally order the Benny Duo..one with ham; the other with lox...and the Spud something (fancy name for hash)with bacon and chicken sausage. Twenty minutes later we received room temperature food. All of it. Nothing on either plate was the correct temperature of hot. The ham on the one Benny was a thin slice of grocery store deli meat. The one slice of lox on the other was diced up so fine and completely flavorless. As was the hollandaise sauce. We couldn't find the bacon in the hash and I promise that whatever they called chicken sausage simply wasn't chicken sausage. We're still trying to figure out what that meat was. Throughout all of this...no server. When she finally came by and asked if we were ok we told her what was wrong with the food. She simply said ok and took the plates away. She never came back. A manager stopped by a few minutes later. We explained to her what the issues were and she comped the check. By this time it's 9am and we hadn't eaten breakfast. We left and went to Katz's. On the way out, we walked past a parking lot full of people waiting for a table. I will never go back. I simply have no reason.
