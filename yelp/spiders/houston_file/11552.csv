JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jill - Thank you for your 5-star review. We greatly appreciate your kind words and we hope you'll visit us again soon. Also, you are correct -- we do experience extended wait times during peak dining hours, especially on the weekends, especially if you're in a large party of three or more guests. We appreciate your patience, and we hope you'll come through again soon.
