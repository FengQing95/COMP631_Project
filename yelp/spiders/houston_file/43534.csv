Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came late on a Sunday afternoon and had no trouble at all finding a table.  The brioche was heavenly...light and flaky, just slightly sweet and a little more sweet with the sugar sprinkles on top.  Not  as many places make brioche compared to croissants, so it was a treat to find these freshly made ones.
