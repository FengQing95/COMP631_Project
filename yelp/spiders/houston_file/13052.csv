JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We started with the takoyaki (a traditional dish from Osaka) which was delicious. Then I had the cha ha cha ramen, which is for garlic lovers. Although I didn't feel like it was overly seasoned, it was still amazing. My date had the chef's special which was spicy but also amazing. I would gladly order this meal again but I'm also excited to try more items on the menu. We will be back soon!
