JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a great spot to get your fix for noodles. The best time to go is during the week right before lunch time. Not only does it get busy, but there is also very little restaurant space. With a tight squeeze and poor cellular reception, this wouldn't be a good place if you aren't a social person. Despite all of the negative aspects of the restaurant, the food itself is amazing! Fresh garlic and toppings make your ramen experience specialized to you. I would definitely come here again.
