Uchi////So from the HH menu we got the Uchiviche, Sakana fry and the Machi Cure. GET THE UCHIVICHE. Its this amazing blend of salmon, cilantro and mouth watering sauce. Portion is small, but we were each able to try. The sakana fry, also ordered from the HH menu. GET THE SAKANA FRY. We ordered 2 of those and we were so glad we did. This has a comfortable kick, with thai chili, and a light tempura coating. Machi cure was different, smoked yellowtail, and served with chips, eaten like nachos (no cheese here!)
