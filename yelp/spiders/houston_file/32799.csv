Local Foods////One of my favorite restaurants in the village. Great atmosphere, relatively quick service, and although they're a little pricey compared to other sandwich and soup spots (I usually pay around $12 for a sandwich and 2 sides), you're paying for quality food. I highly recommend the Crunchy Chicken and the Vietnamese Banh Mi (on those heavenly pretzel buns), and pretty much all of the sides (except the miso tofu slaw- maybe it just wasn't what I expected, but it was incredibly pungent and bitter). Be sure to check out the soup of the season as well. Yummy desserts, too!
