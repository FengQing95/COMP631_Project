Baby Barnaby's////The migas were about average with a lot of migas I've gotten around town.  They were good enough to put down, but I won't be dying to have them again.  I thought the same thing about the green eggs and ham.  The dish was a little bland and I didn't find them worthy of all the praise they receive.  The chicken apple sausages were probably the best part of the meal, and there home fries were above average too.
