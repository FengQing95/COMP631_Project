JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been to Jinya twice now and I absolutely love it! The spicy chicken ramen bowl is the best, I like it spicy! I came with some friends and all of are in love with it now. I think the parking isn't that bad because there's a parking garage attached to the building and there's parking available across the street. There is a wait for dinner and on weekends but it's worth it honestly. I can't wait to go again soon!
