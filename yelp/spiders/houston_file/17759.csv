Uchi////We happened on this place when visiting home/Houston and ended up really enjoying a light sushi dinner before a night out.  We were impressed at the unique rolls they had, good drinks/wine, and the service was really friendly...  they went out of there way to let us sit in the best spot (we choose the actual sushi bar) and the sushi chef that ended up helping us out was awesome, consulted us on the nigiri/maki that we would like, and it all tasted great.  Definitely the sushi place in the area - heck we had driven in from Spring even.
