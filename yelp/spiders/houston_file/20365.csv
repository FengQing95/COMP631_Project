Uchi////Love love love this place! I've been to the original location in Austin but only recently got to trying out this Houston location. My co-workers and I wanted to grab happy hour so we got there around 4:50 (Happy hour & doors open at 5) and there was already a line waiting outside. When 5 came around, they were quick to get everyone seated and start taking orders.
