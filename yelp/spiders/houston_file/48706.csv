Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ummmmm.... I don't know exactly where to start. I like quirky food, but I also like tasty food. The food to me was more quirky than tasty. I got the steak eggs Benedict, with scrambled eggs (I know, who orders Benedict with scrambled eggs, lol). It was okay, could have been seasoned better. The grits cakes were pretty tasteless. I have heard great things, but I don't think I would be back. Maybe out of curiosity.
