Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The service was horrible. The waitress who brought our drinks slammed the drink on the table. It took a long time for a server to come take our order. I ordered the mushroom quinoa burger with fries. The burger didn't taste good and the fries were okay. I wouldn't come again. The only thing I did like was "The Boss Lady" cocktail even though the drink filled the glass half way.
