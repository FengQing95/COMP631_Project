Local Foods////I got a chicken sandwich and a side of a kale salad (not my idea but I was told kale is very healthy). THEY PUT KETTLE CHIPS IN THE SANDWICH FOR CRUNCH! Â I did that when I was a kid...Muy Bueno. The kale was bitter but had raisins in it so bitter with moments of sweet. She had the Asian Chicken Salad. The chicken was as moist as she said my chicken was. No sides, she had some of my Kale.
