Kata Robata////Ordered two drinks which also disappointed us. Bf's drink tasted like lemonade. My drink had coconut milk and it was WARM. What kind of cocktail is warm?! Waitress mentioned the bartender was new. I glance at the bar and he's flipping through a book (I assume it's a drink recipe book).
