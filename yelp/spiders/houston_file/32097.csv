Local Foods////The first time I came I got the crispy chicken sandwich with fries and the orzo salad on the side. The sandwich is AH-mazing and definitely my favorite thing on the menu. The chips were great (homemade and deliciously seasoned.) I didn't realize the orzo would be cold so I was a little disappointed, but it was still very tasty. I also shared a seven layer bar for dessert and it was AWESOME. (Get this, people!)
