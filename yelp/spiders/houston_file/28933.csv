The Pit Room////Worth the hype. Best barbeque that I've had in Houston. The potato salad is divine. The sliced brisket is thick and flavorful. I had my items to go and they held up well during the drive home. Service is speedy and kind. The line gets long and the inside can get crowded, but nothing too bad. If an introvert like me, who hates crowds, can handle it - anyone can. Highly recommend!!!
