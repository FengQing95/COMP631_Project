Uchi////I like & don't like the rest of Uchi's interior design- 50/50. It is most probably the wallpaper that throws me off... I have never been a big fan of kitsch or pop-art and I think a more subtle and stylish wallpaper could have made Uchi a much more upscale and sophisticated experience, to match the Ã¼ber high price tag the clientele is paying... To match the feel of this historical Houston landmark architecture.
