Kata Robata////Uni nigiri:  YES, get this.  I've had good uni and bad uni, and this was good.  I don't exactly remember the origin of this one, but it was better than most.  It didn't have too much of that slimy texture (a good ratio with rice).  I enjoyed it, while my girlfriend was less than happy to have tried it.
