The Pit Room////One of the best barbecue places in Houston! Great BBQ sauce leaning toward the tangy side.  Pork ribs are good, brisket is better and the jalapeño cheese pork sausage is the best in Houston. The sides are just as good. The charo beans and elote are my favorites. Small quaint location on Richmond with plenty of parking in its lot and next door at the patio. I can't wait to go back.
