Uchi////This place never dissapoints. It's not fair that when I eat sushi, I expect Uchi-like dishes. There is a reason why this place is top in the city. The service is above & beyond. The food is off the charts. We love this place. We love sitting at the sushi bar (even though it took 2 hours to get a seat). We love Son. We love Josh. And we love Niki (the only female Sushi chef in Houston). Uchi is worth every dime. Kudos.
