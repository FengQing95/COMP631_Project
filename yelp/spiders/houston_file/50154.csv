Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This visit - I decided to give it another try on a Thursday morning around 8:30am: no wait. There was still no parking cause that lot is small but no worries there's so much parking on the street! Already my experience felt better. I had the French toast neat which was delicious. So good! Perfectly sweet without it being overly done. They have a cream that's on there that you can spread onto your French toast that taste like the cream in cannolis which was yummy. By the time I got to them they were a but cold and I really still enjoyed them. I also shared the eggs benedit III and chicken pot pie both of which I enjoyed.
