Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh man, it's rare for me to crave pastries, but I'm already craving another almond croissant. It's so light, buttery, and flaky with a slight crisp on the outside. The massive croissant itself is topped with powdered sugar and slivered almonds, which add a perfect touch. There was a little bit of almond flavored filling on the inside for you to really appreciate the almond flavor of the croissant without it being too rich or sweet. The size of the pastry is definitely more than enough to really fill you up. I was pretty stuffed.
