Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the duck confit and it was quite good! Moist and tender duck (as expected) over what seemed like stewed beans. Bread was nice and crisp so it was a pleasure dipping it into the beans. Good dish. I think it was like $15-17 so it was quite pricey but it honestly was well executed... even so, I don't think I'd order it again, not for a while at least.
