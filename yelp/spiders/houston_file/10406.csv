JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I think I heard too much hype about Jinya before I went there.  Don't get me wrong it was good, but not as good as the hype.  If you want a trendy/hip atmosphere for ramen then this is definitely the spot.  The look is very modern with loud dance music...felt very hip which has its place.  I had the seaweed salad and the spicy tonkusu.  The ramen broth was very tasty, but what fell short was the noodles were not as good as other ramen spots that make their noodles fresh.  If the noodles were better, I would have given one more star as I really enjoyed the flavor of the broth.  We had a nice dinner there, and I will go back if in the neighborhood, but I don't think it is the best ramen in town.  We took lyft to get there but parking may be a problem.
