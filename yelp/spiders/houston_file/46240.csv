Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ordered the soft scrambled with applewood bacon with fresh baked baguette. The eggs were very flavorful. I had asked they be medium rather than soft. Perfect. Unfortunately the bacon was not completely cooked, certainly not crispy. The baguette was toasted and so good. If butter and jelly were included, would have been five star! Will do again!!
