Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Not worth the wait. Go to empire cafe instead. This place really needs to optimize their operations. In my hour wait I watched 3 tables sit empty for 15 min increments. Their staff literally times how long you have been waiting on their iPads. Maybe they are trying to create a fake image or how "in demand" they are. In a foodie city I don't see them lasting if they don't step up their game. They are more focused on expansion in Houston right now than improving the customer experience at their current locations. The food is good, but all locations are slooooow in Htown.
