Kata Robata////Best sushi place in Houston- and you'll pay for it. This is Houston's version of Uchi- just not as good/inventive. But- there are plenty of items we enjoyed. Get the uni/crab spoons, the foi gra scallops, the tuna tartar, and sushi/sashimi. We ordered these items as well as some drinks on HH and came out with a bill of $78 for 2 people. We enjoyed the food and service and will be back for the omakasse!!
