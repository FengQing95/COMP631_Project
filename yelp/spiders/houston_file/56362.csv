Kata Robata////My friend couldn't stop talking about how great the pork belly bun was but as I don't eat pork I can't say much about it but the Kobe beef wraps were everything you could possibly want in a mini taco. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients. The acid to spice levels were balanced. Next item to follow was the agedashi tofu which was NOT soggy. I cannot emphasize on how many times restaurants mess up a dish as simple (or not so simple) as the agedashi tofu. If you are not familiar with it, then you should order it the next time you are here. It is a simple firm tofu dish which has a starchy crusting on the outside and has been deep fried. Served in a broth; usually by the time it comes to your table you end up with a soggy wad of wet sponge like substance but KR serves it right. The exterior is not only crunchy when it is served with waving katsuobushi (bonito flakes) but stays crunchy all the way up until the last piece of the tofu is consumed. The inside is this beautiful firm silky tofu which basically melts in your mouth. The broth adding the flavor you just want to put your mouth in the bowl and forego the chopsticks and just eat it as if you're bobbing for apples. Next we tried the salmon and soft shell crab roll. It was so good that we got two of them. The longhorn roll was the perfect choice to end our absolutely delicious meal.
