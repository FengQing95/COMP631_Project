Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Their take on shrimp and grits was mediocre at best. The tomato taste was too strong too acidic. It completely drowned the flavor of the cheese and shrimp taste out completely my son ordered pancakes he described them as HISD school cafeteria pancakes. They were hard as rocks and taste of cardboard. Weak please libations try harder.
