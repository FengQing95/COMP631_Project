JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The atmosphere is good. Nice and clean.  The ramen noodle is tasty. I ordered Tonkotsu black However, the soup is too oily and too much.  My friend ordered Tonkotsu Assari which taste better but needs little kick in it if it is called "Tonkotsu" (Pork bone broth soup).  The quality of Ramen is still far from "authentic".  Good thing is that there is not much competition in Houston. Therefore, Jinya is always packed.  To me, one time is enough.  Price is high as ramen noodle too.   The service also needs to improve.  The waitress was sitting on the bar and chatting with her colleagues, so we needed to ask her help if we needed.  I can not call this as " Japanese ramen restaurant".
