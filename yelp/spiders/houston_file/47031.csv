Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came for brunch and I, of course, got the pancake flight! The experience was awesome and my waitress was so sweet. I got the pumpkin, sweet potato and the peanut butter cup pancakes. They were all very enjoyable. The peanut butter cup may have been a little too decadent but I still ate the whole thing. Will be returning but hopefully not on a weekend because there is a very long wait. Looks like I will need to round up some fellow unemployed friends to venture to this place during the week!
