JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has a good vibe and nice atmosphere. Although I didnt get any drinks, I see that they have a full bar. Their food is good depnding on what you get. The ramen bowls are really good, especially with an added egg. However, the kale "lollipops" as they call it, was not. That was just batter fried kale. But its a great place for a date and the amosphere inside makes up for the food.
