JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I only really like miso ramen so take my review with a grain of salt. The spicy miso ramen is pretty good, but too expensive, and it doesn't even come with an egg; you have to add it. Â I would not seek this place out for ramen but I've been there numerous times because it's convenient.
