Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came around 1:40PM. Checked in and gave them my name and number and was told it would be an hour for the wait. It didn't matter because my boyfriend and I really wanted to try this place since the reviews looked so good! We waited in our car for the wait since we didn't want to lose our spot in the lot. They have 2 small lots.
