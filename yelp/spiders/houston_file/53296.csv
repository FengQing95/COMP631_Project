Kata Robata////Typically, I order sashimi and a couple of appetizers depending on my hunger level, however with this particular group, we tend to order a variety, especially if the test run passed the test.  The chicken and beef skewers were tender and juicy.  We also tried the Japanese sausage, dumplings and a Nobu-style appetizer of thinly sliced fish topped with jalapeno--all which were pretty good.  The salmon and tuna sashimi were also tasty.  I recommend trying out their happy hour so you can taste a variety at an economical price.   I believe they have a steak night on Wednesdays for around $13.  I haven't tried it yet, but have intentions of doing so.   I would also like to check out their patio when the weather is right.
