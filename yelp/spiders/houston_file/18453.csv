Uchi////When we got to the hostess stand, they were giggling and what-not and no one even said Happy Anniversary. Ever. Not one server, not one hostess, no one. At Uchi Austin when it was my birthday, I was greeted 3 times. Did I expect too much? I don't know but most restaurants give a dessert, appetizer, or a glass of wine/champagne for any celebration.
