Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite lunch place, such a great and varied menu, salads, sandwiches, flat bread, specials.. everything I have had has been delicious. My favorite is the Croque Madame with Parmesan Fries! I also LOVE the Steak Salad with Bleu Cheese and when they have it the Fried Oyster Salad is great too.
