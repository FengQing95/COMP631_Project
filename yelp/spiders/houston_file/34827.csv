Local Foods////Houstonians, stop what you're doing. Run to Local foods. And order the divine creation that is the truffled egg salad with market greens, parmesan, and aioli on a soft and salty pretzel bun. It is the true definition of delicious and easily the best egg salad I've ever had in my 25 of being alive. And coming from a vegetarian, you know this gal's had her fair share so just trust me. All things considered, I've been craving it ever since I left.
