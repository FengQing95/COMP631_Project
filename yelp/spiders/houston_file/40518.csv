Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Let me clarify for you. I did go in with 4 people. It was an older crowd and they weren't up to date on the terminology. We were seated and I asked the host about the sign to make sure it wasn't a mistake because surely in this culture and COVID a restaurant owner or manager would not possibly be making such a statement to further alienate his business but you're clarification is all I needed to understand you're ignorance of the current situation we're in.
