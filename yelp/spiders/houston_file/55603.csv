Kata Robata////I went to Kata Robata on a Thursday night without reservations. My friend and I had waited for 30 minutes before being seated at the sushi bar. Our server was very attentive and very personable. Although he was busy, he was able to remember little details about this being my first time at Kata Robata in the middle of service. He was also quite informative and explained the front page of the menu to me. This is one of the things I really like about this place. The front of the menu changes monthly with different items. I think this helps keep the offerings at Kata Robata new and fresh for returning patrons.
