Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On to the most important thing-- the food! Yea, It was all delicious. Maybe I'm being biased because I was starving, but I think it was just that good. The Breakfast Sandwich was delicious, and the Oatmeal Creme Pie was amazing. My friend enjoyed his Duck Poutine and finished every last bite. The Fruit Croissant was also a highlight and the Chocolate Croissant (which was cold at this point unfortunately) was good and very flaky. I also had a Vanilla Latte, with a simple heart for the latte art, although I've seen from other Yelpers' photos, they have done some amazing art. I would of preferred the latte to have had a stronger vanilla flavor, and while it wasn't the best latte I've had, it still beats out plenty of other places in my opinion.
