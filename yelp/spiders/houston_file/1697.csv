JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Noodles are great in a Japanese broth. Reminds me of the yakisoba I used to get in Okinawa. The staff are helpful and welcoming. They can assist first timers with their selection and add ons. The price is great for the volume served. The ambiance is great and the service quick. High on your foodie list.
