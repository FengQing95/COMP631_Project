Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat review update.  First visit was underwhelming, but manger followed up and asked us to try again.  That was before Covid.  Went back this weekend primarily due to scotch selection for friend.  Great experience.  Appetizers (fried oysters and pulled pork hush puppies) were great.   Wife had catfish with sweet chili sauce and risotto, best dish of the evening.  Friends had pork chop and short ribs.  Pork chop second best dish.  All great.  I had chop salad, very good.  Service was outstanding.  Buddy was enjoying scotch selection (you need to request the whiskey bible to see items in the whiskey room).  The first one he picked was almost gone and Bosscat decided it should be on house.  Still on the noisy side. We did request quiet spot with reservation.  They did a nice job of selecting table.
