Uchi////Service- Not only did we have the sushi chef in front of us, we also had our "main waitress" and it felt like we were helped by 4-5 people. Plates were taken away as soon as they were done, and water was always refilled. I am a sucker for efficient, polite service. The sushi chefs at the bar are always engaging and fun to talk to. They all have a great working dynamic together it just falls together like clockwork.
