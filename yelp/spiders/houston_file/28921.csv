The Pit Room////On our way to grabbing desserts, I noticed a building with pack of cars and people eating so I decided to Yelp it and found out they have BBQs and alot of good reviews. After having our desserts, I drove to the restaurant. Parking is very limited. I literally made a parking spot for myself just so I could run in and grab some food and leave. It was a full house but the line went really fast. I got the dinner option which are served with your choice of two sides and one slice of bread.  I added two extra sides and it only cost me $22.25 before tax! The brisket was so tender and flavorful and the pork rib was the same way. For our sides, I got the Mac & Cheese, mustard potatoes salad and  Elote which are grilled Mexican corn salad. The Elote and Mustard potatoes salad was my favorite. They have a condiments cart that includes pickled jalapenos, fresh cut jalapenos, pickled cucumber and sauce for you to choose from. I grab some of their pickled jalapenos and regret I didn't get more. It was well pickled and went so great with the meats.
