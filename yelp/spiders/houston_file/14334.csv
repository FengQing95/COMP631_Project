JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would like to point out that our extra noodles is the same quantity of noodles that we put into every serving. As we do not make our noodles in-house, we have them shipped overnight from our corporate headquarters three times per week. They come pre-packaged and pre-measured to help ensure consistency in all of our servings.
