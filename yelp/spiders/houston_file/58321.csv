Baby Barnaby's////Oh I am going to be here a lot! Baby Barnaby's breakfast was the perfect "Welcome to the neighborhood" that totally made up for getting my car towed the night before. I was a little confused by the method of signing in on the clip board for a table, but felt much less awkward and new when I noticed tons of other people just not getting it either. The wait for a table was relatively short, but felt much longer standing in the sun with a hang over. Once at the table, all was right in the world. Fantastic coffee served in a carafe at my table, even more fantastic fresh orange juice served in a way too tiny glass. I got the corned beef hash and eggs and it was like no other. My potatoes were a little on the greasy side, but that's why they taste so good right? I can't wait to try the green eggs. I was told to get them and I didn't listen. Watching others eating their would have made me a little green with envy (pun totally intended) but mine was so good I couldn't be distracted.
