Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not one to run to yelp and write a review for a cafe when all I got was one cookie.  But this was the best cookie ever!  I had the walnut chocolate chip cookie and it was delectable.  I'm a cookie fanatic and have had cookies at hundreds of eateries locally and abroad, but this topped them all.
