Kata Robata////CREATIVITY: One reason I keep coming back to Kata Robata is that the menu is extensive, and yet it is always evolving! On top of that, there's a long daily specials list for even more variety! Recently I had the duck and foie gras on cold soba which is a more recent addition to the menu, and it was both delicious and so fun! I love coming back to Kata Robata and seeing what else is new.
