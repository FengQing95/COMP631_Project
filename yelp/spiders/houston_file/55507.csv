Kata Robata////People who sat down after us got our food before us and the waiter walked by us sooo many times without even looking at our table. He probably would have never noticed that we didn't get any food. Not even a dang miso soup that they probably just pour into a bowl from a hug pot. Hell, we probably could have walked out and he wouldn't have noticed!! Â
