JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Solid ramen, very crowded usually, so you'll wait a bit for a seat. The broth is flavorful, the appetizers are just okay, but let's be real, that's not what you come to a ramen bar for. Upscale "urban" atmosphere and more communal bench seating. It's good for a friday night dinner before going out to the bars in midtown or just a chill evening out with friends
