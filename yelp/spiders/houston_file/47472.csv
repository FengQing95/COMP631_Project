Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love Snooze!  I'm not even a breakfast person so that should speak volumes about how delicious the food is here.  The pineapple upside down pancake is perfection.  This pancake literally melts in your mouth. I'm not sure how a pancake can be light and fluffy yet moist and greasy at the same time but Snooze has figured it out.  My side of bacon didn't disappoint either.  Our waiter and the overall service during our first visit was impeccable.  Our waiter and service the second time was subpar.  The food on the other hand was consistent, so I'm giving Snooze 4 stars.  The wait time to dine here is lengthy, so resultantly Snooze loses 1 star.
