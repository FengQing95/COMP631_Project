JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A friend said that Jinya was the best ramen bar ever so of course I had to try it out. The facility is gorgeous and very nicely decorated. We were seated pretty quickly being a party of four and they took our drink orders. I actually like the family style seating. It makes the experience feel very authentic.
