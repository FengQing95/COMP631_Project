JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Margaret - Thank you for your review. We have zero illusions that we will ever be all things to all people here at JINYA-Midtown. But we still put in 12- to 14-hour days where every single person on staff works their fingers to the bone because that is what is required of our business.
