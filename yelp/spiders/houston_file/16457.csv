JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Been coming here for years. First off, love the new vegetarian/vegan options! However, I really don't think the price is comparable (nor is it accurate!) to other local places. It just seems nuts that the vegetarian options are some of the most expensive ones (where we don't even get the meat-- which typically is the most expensive option at places!)
