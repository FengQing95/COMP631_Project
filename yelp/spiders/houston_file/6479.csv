JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regarding your seating experience, I have been in the restaurant industry for nearly 25 years, and I can honestly say there is absolutely no perfect method for seating guests. Every scenario must be handled on a case-by-case basis, and there may have been other factors at play such as the host attempting to accommodate a large, incomplete party with a pending arrival, or re-seating guests who have requested a move from one section to another. We also very often get requests from families with small children who require high chairs that only want to be seated at a table. Regardless, I will use your constructive feedback as a teachable moment for my entire front of house staff.
