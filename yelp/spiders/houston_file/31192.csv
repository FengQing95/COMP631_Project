Local Foods////Had lunch here the other day... I got the truffle egg sandwich and honestly wasn't too impressed with it... I got the side of lemongrass soup with rice and it was a little too sweet for me... I was surprised that it would be sweet... My fiancee got the crab and shrimp sandwich and it was good but not great with their avocado soup... They offer nice healthy sandwiches, a nice open restaurant concept and service was good
