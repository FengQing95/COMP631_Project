Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious macarons!  The vanilla flavor is really good while the peanut butter is just a-okay.  Variety seems a bit lacking though.  Yet, the 6-pk macaron box looks so cute and fancy!  Prices are reasonable.  I dont understand why most of the shops selling macarons are located in the Midtown/ Montrose areas....there are macaron lovers in Sugar Land/ Missouri City, toO!!
