Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Obviously the food, coffee and pastries are amazing, but what really makes Common Bond the best restaurant in town is the service and the staff. The place is always packed but their team is so friendly and hard working that the line moves quickly and everyone is constantly cleaning and smiling. My daughter is handicapped and many places act as if we are somewhat a burden to accommodate or avoid her all together. Each time we've visited Common Bond the manager (or possibly owner) Colin has gone above and beyond to make sure that we have plenty of room and stops back by to chat with my daughter like he would anyone else not in her condition. He even remembed our names after one visit and brought her a lovely macaron which made her feel extra special. The products are great but it is the sincerity and kindness that make this place our favorite!!
