JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alan - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you said yes to your students' suggestion to visit us. We sometimes make the analogy that 10-cent ramen is to instant coffee what JINYA Ramen is to Starbucks. The soup and noodles cost a bit more, but when you taste our ramen, you know where the money goes. Hopefully you'll visit us again and try another bowl. We look forward to serving you again soon.
