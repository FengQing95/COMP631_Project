Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is amazing! You can tell how this food is just by the line wrapped around the building. You can't even be bothered by the wait time because the food is so good. I tried a little bit of everything. One of my favorites was the French toast. I can't wait to taste more items on this menu.
