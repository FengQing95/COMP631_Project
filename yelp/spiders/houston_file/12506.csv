JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We decided to check out JINYA as the restaurant that we originally wanted to go to was closed by the time we reached. Surprised to find this place packed on a Tuesday night at 10pm. We sat at the bar as the dining area was full and as we did not want to wait. I ordered the Jingyi chicken ramen Â and my friend ordered the spicy chicken ramen. My bowl was good but nothing extraordinary. Definitely better than the cup ramen found in groceries. I was a little disappointed that it came with only two pieces of chicken breast. The service was very quick and it deserves a mention.
