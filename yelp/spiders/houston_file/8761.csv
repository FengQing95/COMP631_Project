JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However, to address your points regarding the broth and chashu: The amount of broth and the two slices of chicken chashu are standard. That is to say, the chicken chashu and the broth you received in your to-go order are in the same amounts that you would have received in a bowl of ramen if you were to dine-in. I know it doesn't appear to be true, but since the broth and noodles/toppings are separated, the volume will always appear to be less. On occasion, dine-in customers will ask for their noodles on the side, and the result is a bowl of broth with most of the toppings submerged since there are no noodles for them to sit on in the broth.
