Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond Croissant- So this place is famous for the croissants and I could taste why. This is Batman's sinful indulgence. Â Beautiful flaky layers that just looked as if filled with decades of secrets. The top was coated with some kind of honey glazed shield, topped with powdered sugar that made the kid in me giggle uncontrollably, like the time when my friend chris rode his bike into the trash can. Giggle points 9/10
