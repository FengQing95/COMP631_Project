Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came here for dessert and coffee. The service was wonderful. Everyone we came in contact with was extremely polite! The coffee is delicious, and the desserts are beautiful!! We got macaroons, a chocolate chip cookie, a scone, a loaf of bread to take home, and some tarts. Mmmmmmmm. You won't be disappointed!!
