JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've had a great experience here both times I went. Most recently, I tried the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen which was offered as mild, spicy, or hot. The pork was flavorful and the portion was pretty large. I would have preferred a slightly spicier ramen given that I ordered spicy and found it pretty mild. All in all, a good experience! Our servers were prompt and polite and we were seated pretty quickly despite being a party of 5. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to take a picture of the Ramen I ordered, but I've included a few pictures of my friends' orders, courtesy of Pareesa M. The brussel sprouts in the Sprouting Up Ramen were tender and flavorful!
