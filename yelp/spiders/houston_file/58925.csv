Baby Barnaby's////Green Eggs and Ham is hands down their best dish on the menu: cheesy/artichoke/moist goodness. The egg concoction comes with a side of applewood sausage that is, different, but still quite tasty. Make sure to get the biscuits as your choice as they are buttery and much like everything else here, fresh and made from scratch.
