Kata Robata////For the main course we chose to share the following dishes:  Fried Green Tomato and Shishito (a mild japanese pepper) Tempura, Miso Crusted Bone Marrow, "Kakuni" Pork Belly with Poached Egg, and the Miso Lobster Macaroni and Cheese.  The fried green tomato and shishito dish was a fresh and tasty dish that was creatively put atop kimchi grits, very good dish as a side one to share.  The Miso Crusted Bone Marrow was heavenly, without being too rich.  Albeit, marrow is going to be rich, but the waitresses recommendation to try lime juice on them was perfect and served with a crustini it was delightful.  Again, I would look to share this dish or else it may be too rich for one person to eat all three bone marrow servings.  The Miso Lobster Macaroni and Cheese lived up to some of the rave reviews.  Again, they managed to keep it from too rich, and it was great to share.  Finally, the best dish of the evening was the "Kakuni" Pork Belly with Poached Egg.  This dish is effectively very well grilled pork belly (sort of like super-bacon) served atop spinach with pine nuts and a poached egg.  The waitress once again gave us a great tip and told us to make sure to break the yolk and try and get all ingredients in each bite.  This was a really delicious dish!  From the ingredients listed I would not have anticipated it being so tasty.  This is the one dish I would have been happy to have as my own.  And, as a great response to a prior review where the patron felt that they're not as "inventive" as people are saying, I completely disagree.  All of the dishes were creatively in their combinations and portions, but that "Kakuni" Pork Belly with Poached Egg truly was an example of the chef trying something very different and pulling it off spectacularly.
