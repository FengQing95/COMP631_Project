JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu black ramen 5/5. This was one of the best ramens I've had. It was really good and flavorful. Also if you want to add more garlic to your ramen they bring you out a smasher and some cloves and you can smash fresh garlic into your bowl. That seemed to be the interesting point many people chose to do here. I would definitely recommend this one to any person that hasn't had ramen before. It's a good basic one that even noobies will love.
