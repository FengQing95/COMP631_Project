Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking is a nightmare in the area (what's new?), so I opted for the street around 1:00 this afternoon.  I was able to get in and get out relatively quickly.  The bakery itself is beautiful - lots of natural light with a pretty pastel decor.  The staff was friendly and packed up my order in an adorable bakery "shoebox."
