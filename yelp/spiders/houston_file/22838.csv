Uchi////Love this place! Great for a fancy lil dinner with a great ambiance and terrific waiters. Have been here twice and loved it both times. They have abundant terrific vegan options (I don't even look at the menu they tell us what's good). I recommend everyone try the Brussel sprouts, I've never had anything like them! And anything with mushrooms is prepared so well (Especially the crunchy rice).
