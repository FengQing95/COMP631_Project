Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I personally had the grilled cheese on sourdough with the soup of the day, corn chowder.  The corn chowder might have been a six ounce serving or so, but it was very rich.  You could taste the cream and butter (and paprika?).  As for the grilled cheese, the sourdough was at least a blend with whole wheat but still had a San Franciscan acidity to it that was lovely.  It wasn't overpoweringly sour, though I would have taken that, too.  The thickness of the bread was something on par with French toast.
