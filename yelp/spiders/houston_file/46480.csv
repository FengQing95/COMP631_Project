Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had a late start one day and decided to head over for some quality coffee. Common Bond always produces positive vibes and great coffee- just what I needed! Inside they have fewer tables to maintain distancing and keep everyone safe. I got a cappuccino and it was the perfect size and definitely delicious!! Head over to common bond and check out their delicious coffee and cute bakery items!
