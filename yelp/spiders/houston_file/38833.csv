Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food: This may be why I give it 4 stars. Although they had really good food on their brunch menu, we struggled to find options that did not include eggs or gluten. The menu is small, and although they did not have many options on the menu they were able to accommodate. They also have entre and bottomless mismos for 32 dollars which can be a good deal, depending on what entre you get and how many mimosas you get! ;)
