Uchi////I'd heard others rave about this place and finally got to go last week. I've eaten at many of the best restaurants in Houston, and Uchi's is one of the best. I would have to say that it has to have been one of the very best dining experiences I've ever had. You've watched Top Chef and seen the preparation, heard about flavors and layers and textures and presentation, right? Uchi's isn't just sushi. It's culinary delight! Good luck getting reservations. It's booked solid. We made ours 2 weeks in advance. Try Happy Hour but get there early. It fills up quickly. We went with all the waiters and bartenders recommendations and were never disappointed. Don't be afraid to try the brussel sprouts....they're amazing. We also ordered 'uchiviche' - their version of ceviche. Try walu walu - oak-grilled maceral, candied citris, yuzupon, myoga. You're gonna order more right away! For the service, the top chef flavors and the hip atmosphere....it's priced perfectly. Go for it!
