Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We went and there was a little line but it was well worth it.  I had a cappuccino $3.25 which was delicious and well made.  I also tried both the carrot cake and birthday cake macarons which were $2.50 each and were a nice medium size of very good quality.  I tried the pistachio croissant which looked very vibrantly green and was delicious!!  It was supposed to be my take home baked good but I ended up eating it in the restaurant.  I also had the avocado toast for $12.00 which was very good but a little pricey for size...I like the avocado toast at the Dunlavy better.  Still overall a standout bakery!
