Kata Robata////My new fave place to get sushi and other yummy food.  You must try : scallop carpaccio w/ goat cheese, lobster mac n cheese, pork belly, seared foie gras over scallop sushi, and a roll that I cant rememeber but it was under their signature list and the waiter reccomended it.  I am dying for an excuse to go back.
