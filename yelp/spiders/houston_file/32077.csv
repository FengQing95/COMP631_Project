Local Foods////For a salad, a sandwich with 2 sides and a cupcake the total was $29. More than Panera, less than Ruggles Green. Their chips are awesome. Their beet salad was raw and though I love beets, not a fan of raw beets. The salads are traditional in the sense you've seen them before in some form, but with superb ingredients.
