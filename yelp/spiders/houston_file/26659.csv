The Pit Room////Really good BBQ and sides. The lean brisket was tender and flavorful. The BBQ sauce was the perfect mix of tangy and not too sweet. The macaroni and potato salad were both outstanding. The Elote was lacking. Did not have any of that delicious roasted flavor. More like canned corn heated up with elote toppings. I would come back. Place can get really crowded and cramped during lunch hour which was not pleasant.
