Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ate at this beautiful establishment while visiting inner city Houston. I was greeted by a sweet young lady named Nina who was a hostess. The vibe and ambiance was amazing! The drinks were very tasty. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of drinks . But the experience was topped off when the manager Jose who went around and made sure each party in the restaurant that evening was satisfied! He went above and beyond customer service wise and made sure my experience was great. I will for sure be back
