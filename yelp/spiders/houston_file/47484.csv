Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Best breakfast I have ever had. Everything on the menu looked great very difficult to make a decision. I tried the eggs Benedict and a plate of signature pancakes and wow! both were unbelievably awesome. A big shout out to the management for donating the soft opening proceeds to local charities. Way to go and be back soon!
