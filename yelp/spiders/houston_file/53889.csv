Kata Robata////We visit here regularly for a quick dinner or a casual lunch, and usually have good luck with fresh food and decent service. However, today I dined here alone, and was sorely disappointed by the level of service. I sat alone at the bar, which was covered with dirty dishes, glasses, and napkins. I was greeted a few minutes after my seating, after returning to the front and asking the hostess whether or not someone would be coming by, and had to ask to have the bar area in front of me wiped down. My server was rushed and my order was incorrect; the entire bar remained dirty over the entire course of the meal until I asked that the dishes beside me be removed (and was told by one server that she would have to get another person to clean them). All the while, the service staff chatted behind the bar, with no one taking the time to ensure its cleanliness or attend to the mess. At a restaurant like this, it seems fairly inexcusable (and unhygienic) that staff members ignore and work around messy areas.
