Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Someone described this to me as an upscale IHOP and that's exactly how I feel about it. Great waffles and sweets, good eggs Benedict, lots of options. A very fine breakfast but not worth driving out of your way for it, fighting the parking situation or waiting for any amount of time for a table.
