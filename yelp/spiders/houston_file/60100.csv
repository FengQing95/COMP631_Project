Baby Barnaby's////I absolutely love this place. It's my favorite breakfast place to go to every time I'm in Houston. Me and my boyfriend never miss a chance to go. The food is just delicious, and the place itself it's super adorable. Only thing about it is, there is Â almost always a long wait, which should tell you how good that place is. Totally worth the wait.
