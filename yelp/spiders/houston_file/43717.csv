Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We sat at the window, which was nice because you have a wonderful view of the sweating people on the patio ;-) and the street. Nothing beats people watching, great food and a coffee! We ordered the almond croissant, the kugelhopf and the kouign amann. Everything was superb! I'm so glad to have a place close by that sells quality pastries and bread! The croissants are as good as the ones at French Riviera Bakery...I wonder if common bond will heat them up on request as well though.
