JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Such a great ramen place!  Food is always fresh, well flavored, and arrives on time. The servers are so friendly and the environment is fun and clean.  My favorite dishes are the tempura Brussel sprouts, spicy chicken ramen and the rice bowls.  We've eaten here many times and it's our favorite ramen place ever.  Great food. Great service. Fair prices. Cute decor and fun environment.
