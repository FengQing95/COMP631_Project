Kata Robata////Rising Sun: This roll came out fairly early on in our meal. We ordered it after the appetizers, but was totally fine with it since we were pretty hungry. Our waiter did mention that our other appetizer would take some time. My favorite part of the dish was the peppercorn tuna and truffle vinaigrette on top. Um...yum. Anything with truffle oil on it is going to be amazing. The only thing that really threw me off was the rice. Ugh, I hate it when rice seems like it's been sitting out for awhile. And you can tell because the outside of the rice seems colder and harder than the inside. Super disappointed in that. Extremely disappointed.
