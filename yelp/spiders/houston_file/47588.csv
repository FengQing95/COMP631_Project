Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here to eat with my sister on their 2nd day of opening, and I was very impressed with how smooth their operation was. The staff is so friendly and upbeat (shoutout to our awesome server Jasmine!). I ordered the Bene Duo (Chilaquiles and Chile Verde), my sister ordered the Lower East Sider, and we ordered the OMG French Toast to share. All of the items were superb!!! (But man, that French toast has to be the best I've ever tried.) I asked for hot sauce with my Bene Duo, and they gave me a local pineapple & habanero one to try, and I am in love!! Everything about Snooze was great, but IF I had to be critical about something, it would just be the color clashing theme of the restaurant haha but then again, it's a breakfast/brunch place, so what do you expect. They comp'd our entire tab because they were raising funds for a group called Urban Harvest. Of course, we left the correct amount anyway, but how selfless can a restaurant be to basically be serving people free food (even Jasmine was just volunteering and didn't accept our tip!) If you read into their mission and philosophy, it's all about compassion for people and the planet. Such an inspiring place to eat at.
