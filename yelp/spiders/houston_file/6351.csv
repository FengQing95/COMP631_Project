JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Joshua - Thanks for the great review! I'm very happy you enjoyed our ramen and greatly appreciate your kind words regarding our space and how we run our ship. We do cater to the local population, which is a young, professional demographic, but all are welcome. That said, our lights might be dimmer and our music a little louder than most spots, but it's our food that will always speak for itself.
