The Pit Room////The brisket is tender and has a beautiful bark! It fares better than Roegels, but still not the winner of best brisket in Houston. The pork ribs are pretty great, but what stole the show as the venison sausage! It's got a super strong pepper and garlic flavor, and it tastes AMAZING with the coffee bourbon sauce.
