The Pit Room////We tried the smoked turkey, pulled pork, brisket, sausage, mac & cheese, chicharonnes, & coleslaw.  The sausage was really flavorful but a bit greasy so I wouldn't necessarily order that again, but the turkey, brisket, and pulled pork were amazing.  The standout for me was the smoked turkey-- I've had this at many other places & it oftentimes ends up just tasting like salty ham.  This was not the case here; it was extremely tender & moist but still tasted like Turkey & didn't have an overly smoky flavor.  The brisket and pulled pork were just as tender.  The real standout here was the mac & cheese-- OMG this stuff was amazing.  It's not really like any other mac & cheese that I've had in that it was more like a cheese soup.  It tasted like a it was 1 part cheese to 3 parts heavy cream, and the big elbow noodles held all of that sauce inside so every bite you took you were slurping up puddles of cheesy delight. I seriously considered ordering 4 more portions of that mac & cheese for the road.
