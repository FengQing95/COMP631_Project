The Pit Room////I would say the brisket was the only star of all this food. Perfectly tender and good flavor. The sausage was lackluster, and the rib was dry AF. I think the mac and cheese would've tasted better if it was warmer as it was pretty cold by the time I got it. The elote was good at first, but then it just became one note with the sauce and cheese.
