Kata Robata////The food was all very nice.  The fish was very fresh and expertly cut.  The execution of each dish was elegant and refined.  However, the flavors were generally muted and unmemorable.  Highlights included a raw octopus crudo special, which was very tasty, though simple.  We had two rolls - the Tropical Spicy Tuna Roll, and the Texas Hamachi.  Both were fine, but I actually had trouble distinguishing them from each other, despite completely different ingredients.  Nothing really stood out.  We avoided the Uni and King Crab Spoons due to the many poor reviews on this site, which was sad because we LOVE them at Kubo.
