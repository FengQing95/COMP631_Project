Kata Robata////Came here for my birthday celebration, and had a great time with my husband and sisters. Most memorable dishes for me was the combo foie gras and scallop sushi, as well as their infamous lobster mac n cheese. You can't leave without ever trying the lobster Mac and cheese, it is the best I have ever had, and I've tried many at various places and make them at home too. The foie gras/scallop sushi had a heavenly mouthfeel, like butter - land meets the sea kind of moment. I've had their acclaimed uni chawanmushi before, it was a decent  starter and a good venture to try something different, but I prefer simple uni sushi to enjoy the clean oceanic taste, which I think kata robata has the freshest in town.  The grilled squid appetizer was pretty in presentation but lacked a bit of flavor from the marinade or  sauce. We had a handful of other sushi, all cut beautifully, fresh, and just the right  portion size.  I love their ramen on a cold night, it's perfectly seasoned and full of flavor... Kata Robata is hands down my favorite restaurant in all of Houston for the ambiance and tasty creative dishes.  This place is a great date night to go  to or  spend your special occasion. I wish I could dine here daily....
