Uchi////Was highly disappointed by the reviews. First there was no mention of reservations. Second we were told it was a 45-1 hour wait, but after an hour and a half we were still not seated. After asking about the wait time again they could not give us an answer. A few people walked in later without reservations and were seated before us. Third, we waited about 45 minutes to get a drink menu from the hostess, and when i walked up to ask for one she said that she had no idea we were waiting.... Lastly, after not being seated we decided to leave and eat somewhere since we couldn't even get an explanation of how much longer it would be, the hostess didn't seem to care.
