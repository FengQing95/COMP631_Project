Kata Robata////4) Dessert: Tried the sorbet, the pound cake, and the mochi ice cream. ALL soooo delicious and well-done. The sorbet is fresh, and I loved the Yuzu flavor (a japanese citrus fruit- kind of lemony and zesty). The strawberry mochi is awesome, and if you like fried banana, you'll love the tempura banana that comes with this dessert. Pound cake has little crumbles of a type of green tea, which are also amazing.
