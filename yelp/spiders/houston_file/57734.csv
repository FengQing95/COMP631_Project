Kata Robata////Our waitress was amazing and took care to explain each dish in detail to us without being overbearing or extra - this was a difference I personally enjoyed compared to our experience at uchi (don't get me wrong, despite how dramatic I'm being in this review, I also really love uchi). If you're looking for more authentically Japanese cuisine as opposed to something quirky and fusioned, I'd absolutely recommend Kata.
