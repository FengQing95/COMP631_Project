Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is pretty trendy and the food is great! I typically order the egg Benedict dishes and you can get two types of you do half and half! I will say that the wait time to eat here is awful and that parking isn't always the easiest. I haven't tried much of the menu because I haven't been here often, but taste seems good across the board.
