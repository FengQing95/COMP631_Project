Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I finally got to try this place after hearing so many good things. Unfortunately, I arrived at 11am on a Saturday and most of the really good stuff was sold out. The croissants are insanely flaky and delicious. The macarons are really good, but the lemon tart was just okay.
