Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Brunch waits are no joke here - estimated wait time of 45 minutes for a party of 3 on a late Saturday morning. It's kind of crazy considering this restaurant is huge and can seat lots of people, but it was just super busy and super crowded. Plenty of people just got drinks and waited on the outside patio though.
