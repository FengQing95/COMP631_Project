Kata Robata////I've been here atleast 10 times in 2013 alone. The happy hour makes it very affordable. I always get the tuna tar tar (sometimes twice in one night), 2 crunch rolls, and their pork belly with the egg. After getting those I always try a new dish on their menu. Very fun to try out. Notable dishes include the bone marrow and lobster mac. Will be back to visit again... soon.
