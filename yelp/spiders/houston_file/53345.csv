Kata Robata////THEN ONE DAY, we came in and got our usual...and there was no shumai!  We asked our server, we figured they must have forgotten.  Then she said the chef left and they got a new one...and she didn't think he knew how to make them. OH NOOO!!! Okay okay...I can maybe forgive them.  So we continued to come here.
