Local Foods////What a wonderful restaurant!! Very cool decor as well as interesting and tasty dishes made from local ingredients. I had the chopped salad...fantastic. Others had the Asian salad and also the shrimp arugula salad...everyone loved their choices. anther friend had a crunchy chicken sandwich on pretzel bun...said it was one of the best sando's she's ever had. Will definitely go here again!
