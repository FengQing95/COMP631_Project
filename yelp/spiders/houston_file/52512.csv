Kata Robata////Went there for the second time this past Sunday. Had churaschi and sushi platter. It was a little pricey but the seafood was super fresh and the presentation was gorgeous! Unfortunately our waitress was not very attentive and seemed a little disinterested. Would go back. If service was better would be five stars.
