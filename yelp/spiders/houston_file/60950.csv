Baby Barnaby's////A group of friends and I went to BB for brunch on Sunday and I can say it was definitely worth it. I had the Green Eggs platter. The eggs were definitely a hit as I didn't have to doctor them or anything. The breakfast tacos were also flavorful. It was a bit of a wait but they had a shaded waiting area with coffee and iced water readily available. The only issue I had was the cups given to our table were all spotted with old water debris from a quick wash and that the waiter put the cups on OUTSIDE tables rim down. Im a bit a germaphobe but honestly that is the only thing I would fix.
