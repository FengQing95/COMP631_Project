Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is a find.  Their menu is eclectic and their food is delicious.  I've dined there many times and am never disappointed.  They offer a plethora of salads which are all healthy and generously portioned.  Table service is consistently excellent.  Prices are fair and reasonable.  Parking is on street and is tricky finding depending upon the time of day.
