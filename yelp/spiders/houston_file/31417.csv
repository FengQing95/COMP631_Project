Local Foods////Every sandwich I've eaten here is among the best meals--not just sandwiches--I've had in my life.  No joke.  Everything tastes fresh, service is quick, and the rotation keeps anything from getting stale or boring.  Absolutely my favorite place to take recent Houston transplants or visitors.
