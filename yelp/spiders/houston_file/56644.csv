Kata Robata////We basically had 3 courses of selections, first was a sashimi plate which Steven recommended the fish selection  Next we had their specialty dishes - shumai dumpling (served on a spoon) and Slow Cooked Texas Kobe beef skewers. I highly recommend these two items. Last course was 3 specially rolls. We had a Green Tea Soufflé Cheesecake for desert!
