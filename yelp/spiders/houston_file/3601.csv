JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Dustin - Thanks for the stars! We appreciate your understanding about extended wait times during peak hours. We try our best to keep the line moving without rushing anyone along. So I'm glad you and your wife have figured out a routine that works for y'all; moreover, I appreciate even more that y'all are regulars. This is the type of support that every restaurateur hopes for. Many thanks.
