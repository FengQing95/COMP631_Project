Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Price points for all the menu items were standard marked/hyped-up fare. Most things are heavy so even though it looks small on the plate, you'll probably fill up pretty quick. Waitstaff and hostesses were extremely friendly and polite, however. They list all the sources of their ingredients on the menu and are eco-friendly, if you're into that. Restaurant was relatively clean and interior decor is cute (from what i could see from my dingy corner). I was probably just a little annoyed at how we were seated, the wait time to get the food, only to be met with mediocre food.
