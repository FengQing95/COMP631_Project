Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you're looking for a French boulangerie - you've found it! I heart Common Bond! It's by far the best boulangerie I've been to in the US! I love their Pain au Chocolat and their Almond croissant. This is definitely the place to go if you want ginormous french baked goods!!! Plus it has a fantastic brunch on the weekends.
