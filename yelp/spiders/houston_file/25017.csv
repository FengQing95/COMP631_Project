Uchi////I honestly don't even know where to start with this review. I could begin my mentioning the amazing sushi chefs, Albert, Santos, Jacob, Justin, just to name a few. I could begin to thank the amazing waitstaff who work as a cohesive unit to give each diner the most amazing service possible. I could even begin by thanking the wonderful people in the front of the house who asked me what the special occasion was we were celebrating. My wife and I went to Uchi yesterday to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. We asked to be seated with Albert who is one of our favorite sushi chefs. The staff had our reservation ready for us and we were seated 20 minutes earlier than we expected. Everyone seemed to know it was our wedding anniversary by the time we sat down. It was incredibly special. My wife and I go to Uchi often, not just on special occasions, so it was really nice to feel so important to the staff.
