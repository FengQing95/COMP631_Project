Kata Robata////I'm willing to erase that horrendous dessert from memory though. I've had great experiences at happy hour here, where I tried fresh uni for the first time, and gobbled down too many pork belly buns. Once, my girlfriends and I even wore our tackiest Christmas sweaters here just begging to be judged, but not only was the staff not snooty, they complimented us on our fashion choices. Well played.
