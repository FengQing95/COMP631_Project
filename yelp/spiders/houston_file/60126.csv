Baby Barnaby's////Was off from work today and decided to have breakfast with my mom and sis. Did a quick search on Yelp and found this great little place. It is located in the Montrose area but gives me a Heights feel. The place is very small. We made it there at about 11:30 and were told they were only serving breakfast inside, as outside sitting was reserved for the "lunch" crowd. We sat inside and ordered Green eggs, the Breakfast platter, coffee and orange juice. The coffee was OK, nothing to go crazy about. The orange juice was great, 100% natural. The Green eggs were very good. The potatoes, however, were excellent. They were crispy, yet not oily at all. The service was good. The only complaint I have would be the parking situation. There is only street parking, but if you go early shouldn't have a problem. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely visit them again.
