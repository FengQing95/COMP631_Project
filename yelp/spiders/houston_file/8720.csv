JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been going to JINYA Ramen Bar for more than a year. Almost once a week. The quality of the food has always been very good. At my last visit I have ordered an extra portion of spinach for my ramen - for 2$ in the menu. What I have got was exactly 7 leafs of frozen spinach - just warmed up. When I complained, the waitress apologized several times and offered to take it back. Finally I kept it becausee I wanted the extra spinach. But instead bringing a real portion of spinach, they charged me the 2$. I will look for another Ramen place until JINYA is back grounded.
