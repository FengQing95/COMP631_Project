JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food here is excellent however the service is lacking. I was force to wait almost 30 minutes to get table (when the restaurant was empty) only because 2 of out of the 5 members where not here. Extremely disappointed with their costumer policies. I would happily give them a a five star review otherwise.
