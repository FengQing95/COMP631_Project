Uchi////This is an amazing spot for Japanese food. The sushi is fresh and traditional and of the upmost quality, incredibly delicious and well prepared. Yes, the sushi is not very cheap but it's really worth it and is not overpriced for the obvious quality of the dishes.Â Our server was excellent. I was so full by the end of the dining experience that I wasn't able to take full advantage of this pleasant surprise.
