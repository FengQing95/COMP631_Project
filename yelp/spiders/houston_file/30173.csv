The Pit Room////Sitting in the outdoor seating area with my family, listening to Amarillo By Morning and eating the BEST barbecue made this Iowa Gal's trip!!!  The atmosphere is great, the long line that stretched through the restaurant and out the door went quick.  These people know how to smoke meat!  The Waygu smoked beef rib was a treat!  So glad we found this place!
