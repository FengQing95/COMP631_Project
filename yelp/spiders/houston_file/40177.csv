Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////All hype without the delivery. Service was great and our waiter was very nice and tried to make our experience a good one. The  donut burger has chocolate are frosting? I wish I would have known because I wouldn't have ordered it. They did not have that in the description on the menu. The meat was cooked well but the chocolate  ruined it for me. My friends ordered the burger as well, fries, and the grits. They were underwhelmed at the lack of flavor.
