Uchi////Uchi is what happens if perfection has a child with delicious.  No joke named my dog Machi after Machi Cure.  Don't mess around and get the unbelievable salmon sashimi, madai pieces, flounder pieces uchi vichi for your cold dishes.  Hot dishes go with the karrage , Brussels sprouts, and shishito peppers.  You can't go wrong with any dessert.  I love uchi and I'm not afraid to scream it
