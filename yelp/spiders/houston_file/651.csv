JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here Monday for a late lunch with 2 girlfriends and was absolutely blown away by how amazing everything was for such a great price. One of the girls I was with had never experienced Ramen in a restaurant before and our server, Wendy, did a fine job of helping her pick out a dish, was very knowledgeable of the menu, and was on top of everything during our stay. Will most definitely be back time, and time again!
