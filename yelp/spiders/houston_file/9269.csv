JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I actually want to rate Jinya 3.5 stars. The ramen is a bit better than average. I usually order the tonkotsu black. The broth is flavorful and the noodles are well-textured. The small add ins complement the ramen well. The problem with the ramen is that the broth is too fatty. If you ever let the ramen broth sit for 3 minutes, you can see a layer of fat conglomerate on the surface forming a thick fat sheet. Otherwise, the ramen is delicious and enjoyable. The lighting is dim and the decorations are young, great place to have a date. I usually get the takoyaki as an appetizer and it's delicious. I have to stop myself from eating it right away because it's scolding hot!
