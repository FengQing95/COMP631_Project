Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Do I want a delicious, melt in my mouth croissant with a flat white or the turkey sandwich or the flatbread? The point is I can't choose because all are so delicious. If you are looking for a filling, legitimately tasty sandwich, do the turkey club. You won't be disappointed. I sub the white bread for multigrain and ask for spicy mustard but the quality ya the turkey, bacon, avocado and bread make the perfect lunch for me. Common bond has a ton of options and the best part is that I can take a loaf home for the rest of the week.
