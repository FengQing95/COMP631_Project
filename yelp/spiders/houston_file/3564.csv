JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here because of all the hype...if you are a ramen fan and have been to many ramen restaurants from different cities..I would say this was average ramen. It wasn't bad but it didn't give me a WOW factor either. Would I drive far and go out of my way to go here again? Most likely not.
