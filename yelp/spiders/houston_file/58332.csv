Baby Barnaby's////Food n service were average. We parked on the residential street n got a ticket $40 for parking 15 feet from the stop sign. Â Granted our tag is from out of state. There were countless cars 5 feet from the stop sign and they didn't get a ticket. We'd like to support local business but surely not worth it if they can't provide parking.
