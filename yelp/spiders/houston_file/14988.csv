JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is my favorite place for ramen because of the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen! I don't eat pork so I can't speak on the pork based broth. The vegan broth is super flavorful and I love adding a seasoned egg and Brussels sprouts! It isn't spicy in my opinion, but it is delicious and filling.
