Baby Barnaby's////As much as I get around town, I never seem to make it out of my neighborhood for breakfast on the weekends. I did my Yelp research and decided I would make the trip to Montrose. By the reviews, I knew this place would be full by 8:30-9:00am, so we got there at 8:00 and had our choice of tables. When we informed our waiter that it was our first time in, he took extra time to let us know what his favorites were and made sure we had a great experience. We had the Green Eggs and Migas plus some great fresh squeezed OJ. While tortillas are cooked inside the Migas, we asked for some extra corn and flour to wrap them up. I really like the atmosphere and while the other customers kept to themselves everyone was greeted with a friendly smile. The place kind of reminds me of something you might find in Austin. The food was very good but I dont think I will wake up in the middle of the night craving it. I think its solid, but I do look foward to trying some other things. Oh, one more thing. The sausage that was part of one of the entrees was really plump, juicy and very tasty. All in all a great experience and worth the trip from the burbs.
