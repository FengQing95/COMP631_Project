Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I like getting the macarons here. The size is double than most macarons so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. The almond croissant Â  Is a must. Brunch is very busy so if you don't want to wait in line, go during the afternoon and everything is still fresh. I have to try and order a custom cake one of these days.
