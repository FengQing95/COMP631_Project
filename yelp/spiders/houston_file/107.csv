Uchi////Service was great, very attentive. Food was good, there were a few deserts that was a little too much for my taste bud. Lime sorbet I think? No clue but all in all, will def go back and try out other stuff. So happy that they have a Houston locations, always wanted to try them out but I hate long drives to Austin.
