Uchi////In addition, the service was outstanding. They were busy and other people at the bar were celebrating their birthdays too. But their service was so exceptional, I felt like I was the only guest there. I cannot say how impressed I was overall with Uchi. They made my birthday even more special and memorable and I'll definitely be back again! If you get a chance, try to sit at the bar, engage the chef's in conversation, and watch them work their magic.
