Uchi////On to the service, the waiters here know their biz-ness. They are well versed on the complex ingredients as well as the cooking methods that marry together to create the masterpieces on the menu. I have never had a bad experience with any of the waiters that work here, and they always seem to know when to check on your table without being too present or irritating.
