Kata Robata////Had a phenomenal meal here a few days ago. We opted for the "omakase" (which means a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef - so whatever is the freshest and best that day). I can't even begin to describe how delicate, yet flavorful each of the dishes were. Each piece of sushi just melted in your mouth like butter. Even the rice was the perfect texture - firm enough to dip in soy sauce without falling apart and seasoned perfectly. Our dessert was out of this world - a Japanese style "cheesecake", but no ordinary cheesecake. It was pillowy soft, not too sweet, and reminded me of the many trips I've taken to Japan. In fact, this whole experience made me feel like I was in Japan.
