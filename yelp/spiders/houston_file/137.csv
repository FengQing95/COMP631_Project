JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the takoyaki, which was delicious, and shared the veggie ramen with a friend. The takoyaki was delicious and almost too filling, as there were 6 to an order. The texture, temperature, taste, and appearance all met my expectations of a hot fried ball of octopus goodness, with a bit of mayo and bonito flakes on top.  The veggie ramen was good and healthy with lots of vegetables, though I am sure ordering the Tonkotsu would be tastier. (I'm a pork fan.)  I would go back here.
