JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is one of my favorite spots for Japanese food, namely ramen. The dining area is a bit small, but with community tables that allow for group seating, it feels like a diverse dinner party. A nice touch to the atmosphere of this place is that often, you'll hear a staff member shout out a specific Japanese word, which is then greeted by the rest of the staff offering an enthusiastic response. Of course the ambience isn't the only good thing about Jinya. The food is especially delicious. The restaurant offers monthly specials on ramen and appetizers, so don't get too hooked on a special because next month it'll be gone! I fell into that trap, completely obsessing over the spicy umami ramen. They offer free garlic and bring over a heavy duty garlic crusher, which makes the umami to die for! Their appetizers are great too. One of my favorites is the tempura brussel sprouts. Â You can't go wrong with Jinya's tasty eats and upscale urban feel!
