Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had brunch here a week ago, and it was one of the best. The pumpkin croissant was INCREDIBLE. The dollop of filling in the middle was perfectly sweetened. The pistachio one was very good as well, though a bit sweeter. Still, the sizes, shapes, and textures were all on point. My Croque Madame was incredibly satisfying (the gherkins on the side were too acidic and unnecessary), as were my boyfriend's Biscuits and Gravy, which he ate silently, leaving little more than a crumb behind. The mocha was a little funky. I don't recommend that so much, but the Nutella latte my boyfriend ordered was AWESOME, and I'm not even a big Nutella guy. Will definitely come again.
