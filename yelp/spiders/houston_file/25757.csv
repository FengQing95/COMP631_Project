The Pit Room////So the sides I got were fantastic. Grilled okra and spicy beans. The jalape√±o cheddar sausage was amazing as well. The brisket was very disappointing. Barely a hint of smoke flavor, not a sign of a smoke ring, and bark without seasoning. It was tender, but I can do that in an oven. I don't get it. My coworkers insisted it was better last time they came and all agreed the brisket wasn't good this time.
