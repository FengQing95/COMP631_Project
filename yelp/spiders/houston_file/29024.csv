The Pit Room////The place itself is fine, there's a little outdoor seating but we chose to sit inside to stay away from the heat. Got a few things on our plate. Brisket, Beef Ribs, Venison sausage, jalape√±o cheddar sausage, mac n cheese, and elote. It's all cooked well and so moist but the winner of this spot is their original bbq sauce. It has a slight kick to it but it was perfect.
