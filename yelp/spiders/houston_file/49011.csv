Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really enjoyed the corn needed hash, scrambled eggs, and sourdough toast. Everything is organic and the menu shows where the food is sourced. The vibe is modern and the decor is chic. I really liked this breakfast restaurant and would definitely recommend if you're in the area.
