Uchi////This review is LONGGG overdue.  My guy was retiring and I was coordinating a small intimate retirement party for 12.  UCHI & and 4 or 5 others popped up on a search as a possible venue.  When I told my guy the choices he said UCHI sounded great.  And it was!!  I reached out to the Private event sales manager, Marisa Whitenton who excelled at co-coordinating the event.  I told her what I had in mind, she gave smart suggestions for the menu choices & accommodated us with a wonderful intimate party room. I met Marisa earlier in the day of the event to hand off some decorations for an Indiana Jones theme for the party.  She exceeded my expectations in delivering a great feel to the room, which set the tone for his next adventure.  She even brought a few things from her own place to complete the look. She had the menu typed for each place setting and made individual coin packets for each as a take away.  Later, as we were leaving, she returned to pack up the items so she would be able to return them to me in safe condition.
