Uchi////Now, pricing, decor, service, and all the other little things which collectively adds to your dining experience. Prices are high. Very high. $150/person is typical even when you're holding back. Although I must say their junmai ginjo sake prices are very reasonable $55-$85 per 720ml bottle. The decor is simple and unpretentious, traditional arc doorways, stocky, solid sushi bar, and wooden heavy angular tables. The service is phenomenal. Everyone is very courteous without being snobby. I must give a shout out to their glassware, which are Riedel glasses, making my sake or wine just so much more drinkable. Complimentary valet, but come on people, tip the dude $5. Call at least 2 weeks in advance for your reservation. They do have a happy hour from 5-6:30pm. Get there by 5pm sharp. I had a good experience for my first time, but as with most things in life, it gets better with each turn :) eat on!
