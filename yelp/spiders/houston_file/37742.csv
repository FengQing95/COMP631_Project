Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was my first time at this restaurant and the location was very nice. When walking in we were hit with very loud music from a DJ. We had to wait for about 15 minutes so while we waited we decided to look over there menu. There were a lot of items that looked very interesting and we picked out a few that we wanted to try.
