The Pit Room////We visited Houston last week and decided to go to The Pit Room for dinner. I absolutely love all of the food I ordered! The brisket was cooked to perfection, tender and smokey. The short ribs were just a delicious. For my sides I ordered the mac n cheese along with the beans, extremely good! I plan on revisiting The Pit Room when I go back to Houston.
