Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My first impression of BCK was its modern and really cute. Plus today, they added a pink rose feature wall at the entrance. So all people who post on social media will love that. The drink that I see a lot on Yelp was the bosslady drink. I usually dont drink bourbon but it was really good. I also had the totchos. It was prob my fav thing I ate at Bck. For the entree, I ordered Â shrimp and grits. It was good but nothing special or amazing. I highly recommend the totchos. It's Tator tots instead of nacho chips. Soooo good and crispy you guys. Must try. I love that they do separate checks too. We had a party of 6
