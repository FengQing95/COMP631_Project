JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is probably one of the most common and well known Ramen bars in Houston bc of how great it is. The first time I went there, I ordered an appetizer of chicken Kaarage which was pretty good but it was just your basic fried dark meat chicken. My cousins told me to get the Vegan Tofu broth because according to them, it tasted like those 99Â¢ Creamy chicken noodles you get from Walmart. When I tried it it wasn't like I hated it but I also didn't really like it. Half way eating I felt nauseous and just had to stop. The tofu that was in there had a funky taste that just made me sick and that's was that. I was really disappointed since I really wanted to try authentic ramen noodles for the longest. It wasn't until I went back a year later and I tried the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, and mayn lemme tell you that was so much better that that Vegan one and one bowl was pretty large too! I'll most likely go back there now that I know what I like.
