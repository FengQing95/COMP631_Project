JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Meredith - Thanks for our review, though I can understand your frustration with our parking garage attendants. At present, there is major ongoing construction in the garage, which has affected their normal operations immensely. Needless to say, the pressure and stress has increased considerably since construction began, especially since the garage is used by four different restaurants. Regardless, I'm pleased to know you enjoyed our ramen, and I hope upon your next visit, you don't have to go through the same parking ordeal.
