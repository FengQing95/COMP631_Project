Local Foods////It comes with 2 sides so I got the fresh watermelon wedges and kale salad (pine nuts, yellow raisin, light vinagrette dressing) It was so good!!!  The bun was fresh and warm with just the right amount of crunch to the crust when I picked it up.  The egg salad was wonderful, just like mom's.  Order it as is, with no additions or subtractions, you won't be disappointed!
