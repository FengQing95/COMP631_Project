Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Been there for Dinner, Happy Hour, and recently for brunch. Each time has been a delight in terms of food and service. I recommend the chicken and rice on a hot plate dish (forgot the name of it but they only have one like it so should be easy to ask for.) All other dishes were delicious as well and perfect when paired with their wonderful Old Fashioned or specialty cocktails!
