The Pit Room////Glad a spot like this exists in Houston. Just the smell from the parking lot will get you. They have several different options on the menu and dinner combos are served all day. I had the beef ribs and god were they good. My wife had the pork ribs and the brisket and those were both good too. Great spot!
