Kata Robata////My biggest grievance with this place is the sheer noisiness.  Our waiter had an extremely difficult time hearing us place our orders when he was stooped down with his ear next to our mouths.  Awkward much!  Think twice before coming here on a date unless that person is pretty to look at but shouldn't talk...
