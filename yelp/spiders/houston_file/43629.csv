Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had ordered the salmon tartine and the vanilla bean scone with a snow dragon tea. While they were all good, I was expecting more flavor and was a bit disappointed when it was not what I expected. The salmon tartine was a bit on the salty side for me, and the bread tasted a bit stale. The vanilla bean scone was quite dry, so I had to slather it in butter and jam so that my mouth didn't feel like it was full of cotton. However, the snow dragon tea was quite wonderful! Not too sweet and no weird after taste I sometimes have when drinking tea.
