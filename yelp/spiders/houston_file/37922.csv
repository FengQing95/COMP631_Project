Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came on a Friday for a birthday dinner with friends. Great location. Right behind steak 48. The ambiance was great. Loved the vibe on a Friday night. Our waitress Destiny was a jewel!! She helped us go through the menu and gave recommendations. The Okra was great. The cornbread was delicious. We all LOVED the Bosscat Fries!! The drinks were fantastic. The restrooms have a butler there with mints. Hand sanitizer. And a whole plethora of things. The food and drinks are very reasonably priced. I'll be back.
