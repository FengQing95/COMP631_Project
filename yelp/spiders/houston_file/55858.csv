Kata Robata////Once we were seated, that's when the magic started. Our server was really nice and attentive.  Since my friends and I hadn't seen each other in months, we couldn't stop talking once we sat down.  The server came by three times to ask if we were ready to order (in a friendly manner, of course), and each time we weren't ready.  Instead of us having to wait on the servers like at most restaurants, she was waiting on us! She was very nice about it though and continued to remain attentive throughout the night despite the fact that it was an extremely busy night for them.
