Uchi////The food was absolutely stellar! I could not believe how good the tuna chips, the wagyu beef roll, and other dishes were. What really made my night memorable was the "fried milk" dessert. It is meant to taste like a chocolate chip cookie dipped in milk when you bite it. In reality it is milk sorbet, fried milk custard in corn flakes, and chocolate souffle and a chocolate sheet. You put all of it into your spoon in tiny bites, and its delicious!
