Kata Robata////My friend was celebrating her birthday and the staff brought out mochi and banana tempura for us to enjoy. Nice touch! The presentation of the food is lovely and the ambiance of the restaurant is warm, modern fused with traditional elements. Expect to spend more than a typical Japanese restaurant at this upscale establishment, but the food is excellent and well-worth it!
