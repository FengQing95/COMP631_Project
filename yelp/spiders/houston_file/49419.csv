Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Raj provided me excellent service and the food was delicious.  As soon as I bit into my food, I could tell they were using real fresh ingredients.  I recommend calling in advance and trying to make a reservation because I waited an hour for seating.  The fantastic food quality and service was worth it!
