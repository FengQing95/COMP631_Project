The Pit Room////Now that I've sampled everything, my reommendarions? Beef rib and brisket, hands down. They smoke the need rub for 12 to 14 hours and it just falls off the bone. The flavors are so powerful and I could literally eat that all day. The brisket is tender enough and has great flavor. Sometimes brisket is dry and tough to chew. Not the case here. They also make their own bbq sauce and it is solid. It is more on the vinegary side which I prefer over a sweet sauce.
