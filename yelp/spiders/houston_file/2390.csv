JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Other half had the spicy chicken ramen, chicken was better than the ground pork by a country mile, broth wasn't quite as good but had a nice level of spice, not your typical spice more than back of your throat kind that slowly catches up with you. Noodles were thinner, but I think I may have liked them better than my thicker ones. Topping again were ample, and I traded bowls with her to finish off all those delicious thin noodles, they were super the noodles dreams are made of.
