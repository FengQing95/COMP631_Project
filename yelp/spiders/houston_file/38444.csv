Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. First, the service is fantastic, I've been here a few times and every experience we have with the servers, hostesses and bartenders are amazing. Everyone is super friendly and they actually care about your experience. The food. Amazing. Period. The burger and the chicken sandwich are phenomenal and so are the fries.
