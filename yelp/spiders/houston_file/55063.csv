Kata Robata////We ordered the salmon sashimi, Kobe beef skewers, and lychee martinis. Most or all dishes are small. Salmon sashimi has been good with every visit. The Kobe beef skewers and lychee martini are hit and miss. Sometimes the martinis are too sweet. Definitely recommend trying all. The dining area isn't large so definitely make reservations on weekends.
