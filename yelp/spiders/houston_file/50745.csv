Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered a latte for the sake of a latte art. There was barely a design and not even picture worthy. I was told to contact them via email, but hasn't heard any sort of statement back. Due to the wait, it's not worth it to even come back Â to get a latte or whatever "apology" they provide.
