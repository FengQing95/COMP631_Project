Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went just after they opened on a Sunday morning and was surprised to see so many people there. Was seated right away. Excellent service and great food. I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs and rye toast. Finished the entire plate. Very yummy. Will definitely be back.
