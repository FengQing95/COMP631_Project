Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For the main course, I had the HRW pork chop. A+. I mean, I have seen many places butcher pork chops. This was cooked perfectly with a unique glaze that made it truly special. Charred broccolini. Perfect. Not a fancy dish, but flavorful and super enjoyable. Portion was perfect. Not skimpy or huge.
