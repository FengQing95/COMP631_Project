Local Foods////The portions are pretty big; a sandwich and two sides. So we split a delicious truffle egg salad sandwich with a side of kale with golden raisins and a vegetable ratatouille. They were really nice to split it for us since we were sharing. My favorite part is the pretzel bun, it was crunchy with some sweetness. My sister is going back for more later this week.
