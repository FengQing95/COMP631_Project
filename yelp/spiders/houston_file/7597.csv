JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend and I ordered: the Jinya Tonkotsu Black (2) but I ended up getting mine with thick noodles and they were very flexible with regards to changing it. I also ended up getting the Â Pork Gyoza and Salad. The Pork Gyoza wasn't anything special, as for the salad the sauce was very different but it wasn't bad. Now for the Tonkotsu..... I absolutely adore it. The broth itself is so heartwarming and flavorful, it makes your insides tingle. As for the Pork Chashu it was so succulent and savory. My boyfriend literally devoured the broth within seconds.
