Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I like to visit this place when I'm craving kouign amman. Their kouign amman is buttery, flakey, not too sweet and simply delicious, perfect with your choice of coffee. It's worth a try when you come visit. I've tried their beef and grits as well and they are delicious. The place itself has a lovely ambiance, it can be crowded on weekends with long queues extending outside. I would recommend visiting this place on weekdays tp avoid the long queue. The service is not the best nor the worst. It's a bit silly that they give you a number for a regular coffee and wait awhile, when you can grab a mug and serve yourself quickly.
