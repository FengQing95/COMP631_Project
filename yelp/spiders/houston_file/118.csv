JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went there on a sunday night. There was a 30 min wait. I ordered chicken ramen. For me, the broth was a little too thick and salty. But still pretty good. Two nice thick chicken chashu.Kind of wish it had more green onions and a season egg. Since this is a franchise, I went online to check out the menu online of other stores in Â CA and Seattle. Not sure why Houston for the same ramens are more expensive than CA and Seattle. I still believe that Texas has a lower cost of living, compared to CA and Seattle.
