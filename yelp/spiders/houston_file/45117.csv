Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is SUPER SUPER cute!  Friendly staff and EVERYTHING here looks so PRETTY!  My reviews are mixed because I feel that just because some items were not for my taste doesn't mean they're not good.  For example the Chocolate Chip Walnut, Trailmix Chocolate Chip and Coconut (?) cookies were WAY to sweet for my taste.  Out of the three the Trailmix Chocolate Chip was preferable because its mixed with oats and raisin which cuts down on the sweetness.  I could eat half of these because they were just too sweet and I've definitely had better.
