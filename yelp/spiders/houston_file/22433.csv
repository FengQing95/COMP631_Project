Uchi////Tldr: Food 4.5/5 (immaculate flavors, not every dish is for everyone), service 5/5 (polite, classy, they know what to recommend and what goes in dishes), atmosphere 5/5 (classy, clean), price 3/5 (again, depends on what you get. First time I went, overpriced. Second time, I knew what kinds of things I wanted, and it was worth for special occasions), bathroom 4/5
