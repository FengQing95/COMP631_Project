JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first time going to JINYA. The service was good, and it was a very nice place. The cauliflower there has a tangy punch, which tasted great pretty good. Their Vegan Tacos were sweet and crunchy, which was nice to eat after the cauliflower. Now onto the ramen. The vegan ramen is really delicious, with a creamy texture. I added some mushrooms and bok choy, which enhanced both of those even further. There was only one dish I thought was OK, and that was the Vegetarian Ramen. It had a slightly dull flavor, but otherwise it wasn't bad. I think that if they messed around with the broth, which was the dull part, and made it a little spicy or have a tangy taste to it, it would enhance it quite a bit. All in all, this was a 4/5 for me, and I'm definitely going to come back in the near future!
