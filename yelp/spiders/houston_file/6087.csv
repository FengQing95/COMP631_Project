JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Small place, but great for the price. I had the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen twice. It's not really spicy, but I haven't tried adding any extra spices from the table, yet. It's a great hang out for young couples and a group of friends. It gets a little loud, but nothing unbearable. I prefer chopsticks, but if you need a fork you can just ask. I had a great time here with my friends. I do wish to return and try sitting at the bar. I will be visiting again and have already recommended it to a few people! Try it out!
