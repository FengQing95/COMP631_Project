Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Otherwise, the food here is amazing! I highly recommend getting the flight of pancakes, and then I highly recommend the sweet potato pancake because it's so moist, fluffy, and then topped off with candied pecans and what's not to drool about over that. There's always also a pancake of the day flavor so be sure to try that.
