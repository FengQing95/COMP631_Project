JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only thing that I can say that wasn't good was the bok choy add-on. I thought they would just add it to the top of the soup. But instead it was cold and floppy on a plate. I asked the server about it and she told me they would warm it up. She came back with a new serving that was just as cold and limp. Not appetizing at all.
