Kata Robata////I had issues making reservations here before. I tried making one two hours in advance, and the person at the front desk quoted me a 3 hour wait time. I don't think this number was accurate, so I decided to not make a reservation and just show up. Since I only had a party of 3 and I arrived around 7:00 pm, the restaurant wasn't busy and I was able to grab a seat immediately.
