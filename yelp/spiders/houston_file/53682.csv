Kata Robata////After a great service from our server James (who not only made sure my hot green tea was refilled promptly, and gave me lemons without me requesting it after noting that I was sick), the manager came around to speak to my table personally. I pseudo-interviewed him after praising him for the meal + service, and was pleasantly surprised at some of the info he provided.
