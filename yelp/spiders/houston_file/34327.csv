Local Foods////Despite having all these delectable looking choices, I suppose I'm a creature of habit because I have not been able to move on from my first local food love of the smoked salmon sandwich on bagel. I hear great things about the pretzel bun, but I'm STILL waiting to get sick of my original order before I try something new. I also really love the side dishes; quinoa and edamame coleslaw. Yum.
