Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////IMO this place is the best of the best.  You can't-will not find a better croissant in Houston.  The coffee is excellent and I think they excel at being a bakery and cafe.  Pick up a few croissants take them home and make your family happy,happy,happy.  Did I mention that the CROISSANTS ARE AWESOME......
