Kata Robata////Food-wise, fish is really fresh so you can't go wrong with whatever your fave is.  For specialty entrees, everything just sounds good.  And creative.  The duck salad is good.  I never thought about pairing duck with avocado, but it works.  It's a nice fresh dish to start.  The pork belly is delicious.  It's super tender with a nice crisp.  The portion of pork belly is small but comes in a big bowl of rice and vegetables, with a poached egg on top.  I just wanted more pork belly.  I didn't try the lobster mac but it didn't look that appealing - however the kobe beef skewer it comes with is great, with the beef melting in your mouth.  I also had a bite of fois gras and it also melted in my mouth.  I love fatty animals.
