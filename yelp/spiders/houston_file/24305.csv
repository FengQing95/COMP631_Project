Uchi////I came here with connoisseur friend and we decided to order three of the machi cure because we had been reading up on how amazing this single dish is. And believe me when I say this, it really is! It is a smoked yellowtail atop some yuca chips that have been sliced longways to give a plantain chip like texture but think paper thin delicate textures which disintegrates along with the fish which has a nice chew upon biting into it. The marcona almonds give it a nice crunch and textural oomph. So glad we ordered three of them because this was definitely one of the dishes that we just couldn't get enough of.
