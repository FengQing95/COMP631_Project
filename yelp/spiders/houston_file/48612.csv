Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hailing from Colorado, I'm Â not a stranger to Snooze. The food is excellent! I had breakfast tacos and the pancake flight (see picture). The waitress messed up the pancake order and gave me a pineapple pancake instead of a peach pancake, however it was still delicious so I didn't mind that too much. The second issue I had was when ordering a mimosa. I ordered a pineapple choice mimosa but was charged for a mmm mimosa with pineapple juice substituted. The choice mimosa was $6 and the mmm mimosa was $7. Somehow I was charged $8 for her making it an mmm mimosa with pineapple when that isn't what I asked for. When I received the bill I pointed it out to her and she said "Oh, I made you the mmm mimosa with pineapple added, is that okay?". At this point I just let it go as I had already drank the mimosa.
