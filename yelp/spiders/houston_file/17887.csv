Uchi////Love Uchi.  Always amazing food and layers of great flavors.  Very unique dishes like Ham and Eggs made with porkbelly.  Foie gras sushi pieces are heavenly. Karage chicken is crazy tasty.  Walu  Walu, Machi cure, hama chili are all favorites.  They have great, attentive service team.   Love the deserts.   Order one of each.  I like the fried milk.
