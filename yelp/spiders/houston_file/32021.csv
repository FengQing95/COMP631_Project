Local Foods////I've been here so many times over the years and this place has been consistent from day one. A good variety of sandwiches and salads with fresh delicious ingredients every time! I've tried several of their sandwiches and they have all been amazing. My personal favorite is the falafel (and that's coming from a Middle Eastern). Their salads are divine and they offer seasonal ones- a must try! Their lemongrass soup is only available during colder months and I SO miss it in summer. Make sure to try their butterscotch brownie for dessert- a perfect ending to any meal!
