Uchi////#latepost went here for my birthday, had a little trouble with reserving a table but other than that it was good! We left it up to the waiter to pick our food and he brought out a bunch of veggies, which was a little disappointing because I'm a big sushi fanatic, and we didn't really get to the sushi part until we were almost full. Dessert was fantastic (I do remember this).
