Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The spread of pastries looked amazing. My plain croissant was perfectly flaky outside and soft on the inside, not buttery or greasy at all. The Kugelhopf was good: sweet sugar coated and soft inside with a few raisins. About $9 for you two treats. The clear winner was the croissant, best one I've had in a while!
