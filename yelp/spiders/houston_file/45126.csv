Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yum yum. It felt delightful with the sun shining on my face as I was sipping this beautiful latte. My croissant egg sandwich (essentially) was delicious! The croissant was perfectly flaky and crispy on the outside, but layered and rich on the inside. The eggs were cooked perfectly with a bit of runny yolk and yet not over fried to crispness. It complemented the croissant very well, even though I originally wanted it with the baguette (they said it wouldn't be good, but nonsense! It would have been fine!). The soft eggs were soupy like grits and scrambled eggs which was unique bc you basically spread it on your baguette! The baguette was elastic and airy and not too hard and crunchy like I'm used to, so it was quite satiating.
