The Pit Room////Went during lunch with a girlfriend. It was pretty busy but the restaurant interior is more than accommodating. We both ordered a 2 meat dinner plate to have options and get a taste of everything. I chose brisket from the toe bc I like my brisket super moist. My other meat was pork ribs and sides were elotes and Mac n cheese. The brisket was good but lacked the smoky flavor you'd expect from being smoked. The ribs were well seasoned but really tough, the Mac n cheese was more liquid than cheese and the elotes was sitting in a steamer of fat and was dripping in oil. The restaurant as a whole is quaint and very Austin like but they need to work on the smoking of their meats.
