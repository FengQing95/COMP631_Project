The Pit Room////Easy five stars. A lot of barbecue restaurants severely disappoint me with their lack-of-effort-side dishes. The Pit room had plenty of seating, they manage a long line very very well, the staff was extremely friendly (huge plus), and the food was just incredible. Everything was good.
