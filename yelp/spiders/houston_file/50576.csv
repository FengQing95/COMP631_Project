Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also had two eggs as a side order. You can get anything on the side for the same price. The people there will make you a good deal on getting 3 things for a little under $20, and that is a good deal. I always try to try something new every time I am here, but this dish seemed to be the hit of the breakfast party. I will for sure come back with someone to show them what wonderful breakfast and brunch options are here.
