Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Probably my favorite place in the river oaks area, the food is delicious and they have a weekend brunch that is never going to be forgotten once you eat it. Service was great so I left a great tip, Brooke was in training but she was awesome. Jack the manager was also very very helpful, respectful, and guest-oriented, it was my birthday and they treated me as a king! Will definitely be coming back, the Carolina Salmon was great! Thanks again!
