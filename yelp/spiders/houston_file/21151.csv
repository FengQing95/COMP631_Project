Uchi////I was honestly a little skeptical at first because of the price but the food turned out to be worth every dollar they charge. We ordered about 6 or 7 different dishes and loved every single one of them. My favorite was the one with salmon and salmon roe. It was served with grounded ginger on a bowl of ice. Great presentation. Was definitely already impressed. The salmon sashimi was super fresh and the salmon roe added a hint of saltiness, an amazing finishing touch to the taste. I've since been daydreaming about the food I had there. I will definitely go back!
