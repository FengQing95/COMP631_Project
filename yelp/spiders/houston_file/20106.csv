Uchi////Really glad my dining companion had a good commission check giving us the occasion to dine here because my hand sure wasn't going to reach for that bill when it came!  I'm not saying I'm cheap, but I'm saying this pricing mess is for the birds.  I'm willing to pay for a nice meal... but come on Uchi Houston/ Uchinko Austin... are you for real??
