The Pit Room////For restaurant barbecue this place is phenomenal. The pickled bar they have us awesome with the pink onions and regular onions and the selection there for toppings is great. The guys behind the window fixing up your plate are nice and speak clearly, like they're proud of the product. The seating is not bad and the prices aren't horrible. Good all round but it does get crowded.
