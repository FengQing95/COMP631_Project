JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food is just, well, amazing. I always get Sprouting up Ramen and I am never disappointed. The pork is soft, flavorful and tender. The brussel sprouts are delicious and the broth is to die for. I want to get in and swim around in it. Noodles are the perfect consistency. I always make sure to order my broth piping hot.
