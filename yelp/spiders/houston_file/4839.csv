JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Meh, my wife is a big fan of ramen so we checked this place out. Not sure it even earns three stars.  Not bad but still some of the worst ramen in this town. Maybe it's got good ratings from culturally isolated downtown folks who don't know better?  Ramen broth was a salt bomb, maybe trying to cover up for the weak broth.  Also, brussels sprouts don't belong in any self-respecting ramen.
