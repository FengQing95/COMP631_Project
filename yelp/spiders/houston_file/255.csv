JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sorry to hear that you didn't enjoy your experience at Jinya Ramen Bar.  I'm sincerely disappointed to see your 1 star rating being that we really do strive to bring good ramen and service to Houston.  That being said, can you tell me which ramen entree you ordered so that I can ensure that our ramen dishes are prepared correctly?  You stated your ramen was "so salty" and I want to make sure that our food meet our recipe guidelines.  In regards to pricing, well. . .we are in Midtown.  Rent here isn't cheap and neither are any of the restaurants in this general area.  The restaurants next to us are charging $25 to $30 for just for a lunch entree.  Midtown itself is just a pricey area, but we do try to keep prices reasonable.  Our most expensive menu item costs $13.  Nothing on the menu is more than $13.  Should you ever return, ask for me or my managers Keith or Wynne.  Let them know of your ramen and taste preference and I'm sure we can make something to your liking.  Thanks again for your feedback.
