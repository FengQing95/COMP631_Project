The Pit Room////The bbq sauce is on the tangy side, and although I tend to go for the sweeter barbecue sauces, this one was really good. Â The mac and cheese wasn't really my thing, because I'm not a fan of queso cheese. I'm a cheddar cheese gal. I originally sat outside, but had an issue with flies wanting to get a piece, so I recommend sitting inside. It still doesn't steer me away from how great and how special this place was.
