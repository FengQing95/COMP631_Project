Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service wasn't the best i've had which kind of downed the place for me. The bartenders were great guys with fun personalities. However, I feel like we were just sitting there for much longer than we needed to be unattended. It wasn't horrible at first but you would think that two people with empty plates and cups in front of them would get some kind of attention. Even when we finally asked for the check, it took an additional 15 minutes.
