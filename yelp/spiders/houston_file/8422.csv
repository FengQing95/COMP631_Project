JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love, love, LOVE Jinya! This was the first ramen place I tried in Houston, and despite exploring other ramen restaurants (Tiger Den, Samurai Noodle) this will always be my #1. The tonkatsu black is my go-to soup with thick noodles and an extra egg (delicious!). The drink menu isn't too shabby either.
