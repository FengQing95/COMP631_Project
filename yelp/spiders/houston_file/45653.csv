Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Line was rather long and parking was difficult (had to go to the other lot next to the apartment or whatever). The gudie in the main lot let us know about the second one so I guess this happens a lot. Line itself was long but people move rather quickly. We were lucky enough to already have friends alread there with a table so no problems there. Water is self serve.
