Uchi////The plates are small plates, tapas style so it's a good idea to share. I was there with two coworkers and we went to town. Two orders of ham and cheese which was my favorite part of the meal. Basically a sushi roll with pork belly instead of raw fish...amazing. Walu walu which is escobar fish (poisonous if not cooked right so very few restaurants are allowed to cook it) in a nice citrus sauce. Raw beef which you cook on a hot stone, very cool! Tempura baked brie on sweet potato chips, talk about an inventive dish. We went with a couple others as well which were all fantastic.
