JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Oh my word i love this place. I go here almost every week its so good and flavorful. My husband and i order the crispy chicken as an apatizer and then our soup. He orders the chicken ramen and i get the tonkotsu spicy. And for dessert the almond pudding. We spend about $30 for the both everytime we go. I recommend this to everyone its just so good. !
