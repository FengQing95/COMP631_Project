The Pit Room////Decided to try the a new BBQ place and it did not disappoint. Inside is new and trendy with a larger room for seating than I actually expected from other reviews. Came with 5 total around 630 and seating was fine. Quick line with easy menu and options. Pork ribs seemed small but they were quite tasty. The brisket and sausage were phenomenal. I had to try my buddy's brisket as I tend to find other places brisket to be too salty. Not the case for this joint-- I messed up by not writing a full serving of that deliciousness. Wasn't a fan of the bbq sauce they had. Seemed to be too much vinegar and tasted really off (everyone has different tastes for bbq so not a big deal). They had other sauces there too that seemed creative and probably should have stayed an idea and not come to fruition. Prices were on the higher side of bbq but the quality was excellent.
