Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wish we had Common Bond in LA!  We were looking for a breakfast place the last day we were in Houston and found that this was walking distance from our Air BnB.  They have a beautiful case of freshly baked pastries -- their multi colored croissants with different flavors are delicious.  My husband also ordered their biscuits and gravy for breakfast, obviously so appropriate for our trip to Texas.  Their house blend for the coffee is bit on the darker side, so if there is ever a next time, I'd try one of their espresso drinks.  Too many pastries and desserts to try for just one visit!  I imagine this would be a good place to meet up for grabbing breakfast, but the seating can be limited if it gets busy.  I didn't notice any easy to access outlets either, so not sure that this would be a good place to study.
