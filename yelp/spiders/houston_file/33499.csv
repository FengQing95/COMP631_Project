Local Foods////House smoked salmon sandwich: Mediocre. I love smoked salmon; I love a good bagel, and I really love smoked salmon on bagel. However, I did not love this smoked salmon or the bagel, let alone together. The salmon was a little sweet (maybe from the onion jam?) which I found jarring and bizarre. The bagel was flat, and it was dense without the proper elasticity that is only found in full-sized properly boiled-then-baked bagels.
