JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I will tell you with utmost sincerity that our front and back of house work hard from the moment we arrive to the moment we exit the building. We try to serve as many people as quickly, efficiently and professionally as we possibly can without making anyone feel rushed (and with as few mistakes as allowable). We are grateful Houston has taken a shine to us, and we promise to keep working hard to provide quality food, service and atmosphere to our guests. Best,
