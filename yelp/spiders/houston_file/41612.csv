Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After a few visits, I don't get the hype, especially with the poor service and lack-luster food.  This review rested quietly in my documents with the hope that my experiences would prove the exception to the rule, but sadly just not the case.  I hope things improve.
