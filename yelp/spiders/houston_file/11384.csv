JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu ramen 9/10 very good.. It was slightly creamy, has a strong taste, and I got it spicy which was delicious. The ramen comes with 2 pieces of pork belly that has a lot of fat, but it's not quite a bad thing because it's so good and when you put it in your mouth it melts away. My only regret was not adding more vegetables because the portion isnt as big as I thought it'd be, somewhat small imo.
