Kata Robata////From food to drinks, this place satisfies. A girlfriend and I went and got their Houston Restaurant Weeks menu last night. We met at the bar and had a drink there before going to our table. The service, from the host staff to the bar to the table was consistently excellent and friendly, never cloying or slow, just a happy sort of excellent. For each course, we ordered different dishes, so we could sample more of the menu, and there was nothing...not one thing...that wasn't excellent. They confirmed that we were there for HRW when they called to confirm the reservation, but we had to ask for the menu when we got there. Someone dropped the ball, but our server quickly recovered it.
