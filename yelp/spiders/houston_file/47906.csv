Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was disappointing. I had high expectations because of the reviews, but it was all pretty much hype. The food was bland & cold. For two basic plates (eggs, hash browns & ham) it was $40....west gray cafe has better food & it isn't overpriced...plus you don't have to stress yourself to death over parking.
