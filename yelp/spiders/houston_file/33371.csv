Local Foods////This restaurant has a nice modern environment and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is good but not great and I'm confused about their identity, is this a local diner or fresh healthy cafe? It has burgers, pizzas, gyros and wraps, hence the confusion about the identity of this restaurant. The price is good along with the quality of their food and the level of service so just go and enjoy!
