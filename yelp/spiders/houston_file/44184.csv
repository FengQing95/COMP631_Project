Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were just in Houston a few days ago and tried this place out. I had the half ham/cheese baguette with sweet corn & crab bisque, which was SUPERB! I also got a blackforest cheesecake and one of these eclairs to go....hands down the BEST dessert I have EVER had. May make a special trip back to Houston to visit this little gem....haven't stopped talking about it since we've been home!
