JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is by far one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Houston. It is both vegan and vegetarian friendly. My go to dish is the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen with added garlic and brussels sprouts, yum! If you go at a popular time, there is typically a wait, but it goes by fast and you can grab a drink at the bar while you're waiting. Service is friendly and fast. Parking is available around the corner in a free parking garage.
