Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Amazing breakfast.  The upside down pineapple pancake is sinful and a must try. The huevos Rancho was great. The customer service was great. It was a packed house on Sunday. Houstonians take there brunch very seriously.  Pack a little patience because there will be a wait, but my goodness it was worth it.
