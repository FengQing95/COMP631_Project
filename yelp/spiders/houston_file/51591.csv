Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the scramble, which is generally made with eggs, but for vegans, it's done with tofu. With the scramble, you get 3 add-ons. I got spinach, mushrooms, and soy chorizo. The dish also came with hash browns and a choice between flour or corn tortillas. I got the corn. This tofu scramble was one of the best tofu scrambles I've had. I liked that I was able to "customize" it by choosing what to add to it. The hash browns were browned to perfection and very comforting to eat. The only thing that I did not like about my dish was the tortillas! The corn tortillas were a bust: stale, dry, and just not good. I really hate wasting food and will never usually throw food away but I could not eat those tortillas, so I ended up leaving them on my plate.
