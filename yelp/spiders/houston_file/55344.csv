Kata Robata////Food was amazing and the environment was calming and my server was Great! He suggested great sushi Choices to eat. He even suggested a wine app for me to download along with the one bottle of wine that we got for that night. It was just the great experience all the way round. I can't wait to return. Fyi the top-quality salmon was to die for!
