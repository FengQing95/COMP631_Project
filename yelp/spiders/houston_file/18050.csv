Uchi////Celebrated my birthday with a dinner at Uchi, and it was nothing short of phenomenal. The restaurant's self description "Inspired Asian Cuisine" is 100% accurate. Everything that came to our table was not only delicious, but surprisingly so. There were flavor combinations that were unique but seemed inevitable.
