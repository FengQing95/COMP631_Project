The Pit Room////Pit Room is one of my favorite restaurants and is in my opinion, the best bbq in Houston! I've had several items from their menu including: brisket, sausage, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, beans, corn, and their tortillas and it is all delicious (my faves though would have to be the brisket, tortillas and the Mac and cheese). It can get pretty busy, so seating might be hard to find, but there is also seating available outside and next door at the bar. This place is definitely worth the hype.
