Uchi////There are several people that will come and bring out your plates and explain them and they are all really fabulous, especially the blonde guy with a pontytail! He's super funny. There are a few hostesses who are kind of snarky (probably worse by Texas standards) and I will never understand that. These are the first people you will meet during your experience--why hire rude people who start the experience off on a sour note?!
