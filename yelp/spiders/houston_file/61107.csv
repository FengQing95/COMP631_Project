Baby Barnaby's////When the food comes out, it's apparent that no one is going to finish their food.  For a hip and gay breakfast joint, the portions are pretty impressive.  The green eggs, which are scrambled with artichoke hearts, spinach and cheese were good on their own.  However, when married with the chicken apple sausage, it's damn near magical.  The flavors are so calm and pastel and go together like a hand and a glove.  Then enters the subtly spicy and super crunchy potatoes for contrast.  Wash it down with a gulp of freshly squeezed OJ and it really is breakfast perfect.
