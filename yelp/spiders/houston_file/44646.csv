Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Anyway, Common Bond is great. The space is lit with natural light coming from huge windows, and the seating is very comfortable. The atmosphere is very lively and great to hold a conversation with a friend. Though we only got to taste some pastries, the quality can definitely be seen.
