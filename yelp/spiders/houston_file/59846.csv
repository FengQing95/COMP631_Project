Baby Barnaby's////Thanks to yelp reviews I found this amazing hole in the wall cafe! I love places like this! I went at 930 on a sat for breakfast. Found a place to park. There is no lot. All street parking. I was a little confused at where the entrance was. After walking around Â for a bit I found a sign up sheet on the patio right by the front doors. You just write your name and the # in your party. The wait was about 15-20. I was sat inside. This place is tiny...elbow to elbow almost. I believe it has 12 tables and booths., buts so worth it. The food is AMAZING! I was surprised at the number of healthy options. I picked the green eggs because of all the reviews. So glad I did...yum! The coffee is great AND they have a machine that fresh squeezes oranges for your orange juice. This is by far the best breakfast I've ever had!! $15 total not bad at all. I plan to go back again and again!!
