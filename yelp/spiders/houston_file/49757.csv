Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancake flight is sooooooooo good. Order the sweet potato pancake it is delicious. The restaurant was celebrating its birthday and the staff had on the cutest cone hats and were all around really friendly and attentive. Wait can be long but those pancakes were worth it.
