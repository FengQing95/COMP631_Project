Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am a croissant snob. Living in Brussels for 4 years spoiled me - I require the full crusty, buttery experience with enough chewiness to merit satisfaction. I can safely say that the croissants and kouign amman at this bakery is as good/even better than some of the best pastry shops in Europe. The keugelhof is flavorful, not too heavy, yet rich, and the nutella croissant is definitely a delicious twist on a classic. The croissants flake perfectly and are shaped beautifully. Oh, and the lavender latte is delicious. This store should be in every city.
