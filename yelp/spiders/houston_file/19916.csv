Uchi////My Â second time here was just as impressive. Happy hour prices are the best, the only problem is that you have to get there before the restaurant opens. I would suggest any of the sushi rolls or cold tastings on the menu. I have not been impressed with the hot foods though. The walu walu had good reviews online, but the one I got was too bland to finish. Definitely get the hama chili and the tuna with goat cheese one.
