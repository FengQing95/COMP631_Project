JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////cool location, great music, great ambience. i tried the tonkotsu spicy with the level hot and added brussel sprouts & corn. the soup had a great flavor, veggies were yummy, and the pork was good! not unbearably spicy by any means but still good. they also had really unique types of ramen and other foods. would definitely recommend if you're in the area!
