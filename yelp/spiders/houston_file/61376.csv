Baby Barnaby's////There are far too many reviews here to attest to how great their brunch is so I will write about my experience last night. Every year for Dining Out for Life, my friends and I come here because they do a very good job of promoting the cause. The interior is a cute kitschy feel. There is plenty of seating available inside and out even on a busy day. The staff is very professional and knowledgeable about all things they have including if their fish is wild caught or farm raised.
