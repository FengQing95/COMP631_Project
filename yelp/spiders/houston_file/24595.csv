Uchi////Never reserve and only ever have to wait 45 minutes max to be seated. Today, waited over 2 hours and saw 5 other couples get seated before us (all with no seating preference like us) and ALL THESE COUPLES CAME AFTER US. After seeing 3 of those couples get seated first, went to the hostesses and asked them about the wait time and they said oh yeah we have you as no preference. Okay so after another two couples got seated (WHO ALSO CAME IN AFTER US), my brother and I were on our way walking out to go somewhere else when someone overheard our conversation and told us our table was ready.
