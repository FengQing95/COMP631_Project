Uchi////You know what, I'm going to say it: Uchi is only "meh" when you consider bang for your buck. The fish is extremely fresh, but almost everything comes with a(n overly sweet) sauce. The wait staff is fantastic and I can really appreciate some of the more creative takes on sushi and other Japanese foods, but I just think that Kata Robata and MF do upscale sushi better. (That being said, I wouldn't turn down an invitation to return... it just wouldn't be my pick.)
