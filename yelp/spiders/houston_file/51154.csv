Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But, I digress. I opted for breakfast libations--hey, if mimosas are offered, who am I to say no??? There are lots of juice options for the mimosas here--orange, grapefruit, cranberry, apple, and a couple others that fail my memory right now. I opted for the apple, and I'm so glad I did! My only complaint about the mimosas here is that they don't offer carafes or pitchers. Then again, since space is an issue, I guess they don't want people lingering for TOO long at the tables/bar.
