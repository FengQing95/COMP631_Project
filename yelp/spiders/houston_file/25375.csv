Uchi////My partner and I came in for an early anniversary celebration. Angela seemed incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and created a welcoming atmosphere for us from beginning to end. We were excited for every dish because Angela had a back story for each and every one. She was friendly and attentive, making sure to check on us at the appropriate times. We were even provided complimentary Uchi salad the candy bar on the house. She really made us feel like we were special on our anniversary even though there were other people dining in that night.
