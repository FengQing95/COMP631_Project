JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Boss L. - Thank you for your great review. We appreciate your taking the time to provide us invaluable feedback, and we're proud to call you one of our "JINYA Regulars." We understand one of our ongoing shortcomings is slow service, but please know numerous factors outside of our control can cause delays. For example, just recently our point-of-sale terminals were not sending tickets to the kitchen properly, which threw a huge monkey wrench into our gears. But we always appreciate when our guests are understanding, as I do hope you notice that our front of house is never lollygagging when there's a line up front and ramen to be served.
