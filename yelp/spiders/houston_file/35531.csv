Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was my first time here. We had a really wonderful time. Has a very modern Vibe. What stands out from a food stand point would maybe be the short ribs and the okra. From a service and point, it would be that within a short period of time from when my clock napkin fell off my side to the floor, one of the staff came and picked it up and handed it back to me.
