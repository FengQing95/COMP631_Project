Kata Robata////The Omakase Sashimi Plate was a disaster with exception of the Japanese Snapper. I thought Japanese food was all about presentation and knife skills. Our sashimi looked like it was made up of random end pieces except for the lower price Salmon and Tuna. Fois Gras Chawanmushi was tasty but the other $150+ of food was just 'ok'. Â
