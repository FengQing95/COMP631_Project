Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Beautiful atmosphere inside and nicely decorated with dim lighting and lots of seating. The waiter Jose was so well informed on everything from the food to the drinks. I can truly appreciate a server who knows how to describe the food you are asking about with such excitement and details. He made me want everything. I came with a big party for a birthday dinner and he handled our large group with patience and fast service.
