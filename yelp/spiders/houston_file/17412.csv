Uchi////We had the chef's tasting menu, which is 10 courses.  Everything was very good but the frozen foie gras with cantaloupe, honey dew and savory granola...ick, no thanks.  We had an open mind about it but that was one dish we would not have again.  The sushi was delicious and the courses were filling.  The tasting menu was very pricy and we will probably not be trying that again.  The service was great.  There is complimentary valet parking in the back off the restaurant or you can probably find some street parking nearby.
