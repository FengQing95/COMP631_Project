Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The original common bond was sold in 2016 to Carraba's. Like all business that eventually get sold, costs need to be cut or prices needed to be increased to capture the returns. The original head baker/chef Roy Shvartzapel made Common Bond an incredible spot. Since it has been sold, it has changed and I'm STILL chasing the original high of the original techniques and recipes.
