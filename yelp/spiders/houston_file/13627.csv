JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After both of us were done eating, a gentleman next to us left the seat and asked out waitress if we can keep that chair for our friend who'll stop by. I got the confirmation, and when he came to sit down, another waitress came to say we can't do that! I felt like their communication was off, and I shouldn't have been blamed as a customer. It was really rude of her to say this was wrong... when there was no single person waiting to sit on this bar with us.
