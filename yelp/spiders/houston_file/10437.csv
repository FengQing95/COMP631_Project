JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was good and I didn't even have ramen. I meant to, but wanted to try a few small things instead of one big. Kale/quinoa salad, chicken curry and rice, and tuna tacos. All we're very good but my favorite was the curry rice and the hot sauce was perfect. Neat environment, my only feedback was I asked for the cold salad first and after 20 +minutes all the food came out at once. When you are starving...that's not good. My waitress was great though and very sweet. Cool place. 3 stars is for the slow food time mostly, and the screaming child on one side and college kids being vulgar on the other.
