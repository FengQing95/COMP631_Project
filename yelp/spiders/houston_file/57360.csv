Kata Robata////We started out with the ceviche appetizer, which was appropriately bright and refreshing. Next came the Brussels sprouts: flash fried, savory, and not drowning in sauce, which was appreciated. My favorite appetizer was the Fish and Fish - this reminded me of my childhood, when all of the fish prepared for us by my mom was still on the bone. The flesh was moist and tender, and slurping the fatty pieces from the bones was a nostalgic treat.
