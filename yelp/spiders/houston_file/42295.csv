Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is awesome....The space is very open and very modern....The menu is always changing with very fresh unique entrees, but their Potato chips are AMAZING....The staff are very friendly...I am glad that this place is close to work so I can come her often for lunch....I am not big on sweets soI have not tried the bakery items or macaroons but they all look amazing....I could honestly go back and be happy with just the potato chips and a tipo chico
