JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy Miso Tokotsu (Chef's Special) - My boyfriend loves spicy so he ordered this for himself. This ramen came with minced pork instead. I personally loved this one the most. It was spicy and had all the ingredients that I liked (spicy bean sprouts and thick noodles). By the way, the thick noodles have more flavor! My boyfriend and I ended up switching ramens since he liked the black one more and I liked this one.
