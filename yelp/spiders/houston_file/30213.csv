The Pit Room////But that elote though.... I've never had elote as good in my life. I love that it comes in a cup, filled to the brim with corn, cheese, and hot sauce. I've only ever had it on the cob. All things are not created equal. The coleslaw was crisp and refreshing, especially after the heaviness of the meat and the elote.
