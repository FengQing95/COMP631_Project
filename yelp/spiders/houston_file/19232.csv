Uchi////- Lime Ash Sorbet. Their best dessert, imo. We asked our incredible server (wish I could remember his name! Michael, maybe?) what lime ash is, and he was kind enough to go the kitchen, get some dehydrated lime and a bit of finished ash, and bring it out to give us a show-and-tell demonstration and tasting! How cool is that? I know everyone raves about the fried milk, and yes it's good, but the lime ash sorbet is the oft overlooked green-headed step-dessert. Try it.
