Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our server was great too, BreAnne was her name and she came out dancing lol! Ashley was a nice hostess as well. When I started dancing while eating my delicious Bobcat burger, PJ (from the Newport location) came up and talked to us, he was really nice and genuinely sweet. I like their bourbon Â room and their furniture inside and out. The place is just cool man. We were talking so much to our super cool waitress, we forgot to use our 10% coupon after we checked in. Good times!
