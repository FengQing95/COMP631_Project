Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On my latest visit, I came in around 11 am on a Thursday and there were still plenty of all three croissants (plain, almond, and chocolate). I ordered an almond one and a Japanese iced coffee to sit with while I studied. The iced coffee was nothing special - less bitter than cold brews, but not as full bodied as I would have preferred (although I appreciate coffee shops which still offer non-cold brew iced coffee as they're becoming rarer nowadays). They offer cream, skim milk, and almond milk which is nice when most places charge extra for almond. The lack of a simple syrup leaves much to be desired though (I hate having undissolved sugar at the bottom of my cup). The biggest plus is the free refills, which I've never gotten for iced coffee before. If you're planning on staying a while, this easily makes it some of the cheapest iced coffee in town. You can also ask for a to-go cup before you leave and they'll even top off your coffee. The croissant definitely ranks as one of, if not the best, I've ever had. It's perfectly buttery and flaky, with the most almond-y cream filing.
