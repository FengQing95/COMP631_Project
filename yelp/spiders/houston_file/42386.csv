Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Good pastries, food & coffee. Some pastries are better than others. Cherry danish, for instance, has canned cherries on it. Tastes like something from a supermarket...pretty disappointing. Is way too crowded on weekends (even weekdays) Expect long wait times & trouble finding seating. Â Still worth visiting though. Good atmosphere & decor.
