Baby Barnaby's////I can't say enough good stuff about this cutie patootie diner! There really aren't any vegan options but if you're vegetarian they have veggie sausage patties and some other options. Our server Â Scott, was by far my favorite server, ever. He was funny, had great suggestions and was nice. It's super cute in there and my omnivorous friends really enjoyed their meals. I liked mine, too. Thanks so much for the laughs, Scott! You're the best.
