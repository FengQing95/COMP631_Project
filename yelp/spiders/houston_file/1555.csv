JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far some of the best Ramen you will eat in the greater Houston area. I really wish they had an oxtail broth like some of their competitors not everyone wants a pork or chicken and the beef broth is much better if you are prefer no meats. I love their chicken wings too (not sure what they season them with but they are an appetizer worth getting. )
