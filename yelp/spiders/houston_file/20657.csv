Uchi////My wife and I went for social hour and sat at the sushi bar.  The guy taking care of us behind the bar was Harold, a nice guy.  We ordered everything except one on the social hour menu as well as the seven piece sushi sample.  Everything was amazing.  Had the unfiltered sake in the box which was new for me, but pretty cool.  The seven piece sushi was pretty good, but included the seven cheapest cuts from the menu.  This place is by no means cheap, but the food is fantastic.  I highly recommend the Machi Cure and Walu Walu.
