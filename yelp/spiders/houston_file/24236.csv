Uchi////So, I used to be the biggest fan of Uchi due to it's food creativity, knowledgeable and pleasant servers and the overall ambience. The last two times I went, I was shocked by the rudeness of the staff from the host stand to the servers. I had family from out of town and I was raving about Uchi. I asked the server to give them the highlight of the place and the menu and he said: "it's basically everything to be shared" full stop. As he couldn't be bothered and the rudeness continued throughout the experience. I decided to give it another chance and although the server was nicer, the whole vibe now with the servers and staff is: hurry up, sit, order eat and leave..
