JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Coming from inexperienced Ramen eater this place was one of the best Ramen places I've been to in Houston. Loved the decor and vibe. Started with the gyoza which was really good, we also got a free tempura Brussels sprout order because they accidentally made extras. Got the Spicy Chicken Ramen for the entree and it was delicious so was the sweet almond pudding! The bartender recommended the lychee martini which was a bit too sweet but good nevertheless.
