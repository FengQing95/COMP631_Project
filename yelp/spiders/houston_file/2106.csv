JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our dining room is approximately 2,000 square feet, so as far as letting kids run around and play -- we are definitely not that -- especially since our servers are carrying trays of hot ramen. Nevertheless, we are fully equipped with high chairs and booster seats and we often assist customers in stowing their strollers. We do all that we can in our power to accommodate young families for the simple fact that the majority of our employees also have young families to support themselves.
