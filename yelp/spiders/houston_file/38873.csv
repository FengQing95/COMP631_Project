Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Words cannot begin to express the level of frustration I had reading your review and knowing that this was your first experience in one of my restaurants. Let me start off first by apologizing to you that nobody deserves to have an experience like this and I am so sorry that this was yours. We pride ourselves on our ability to provide high quality food, drinks, and service at all times and it is clear to me that we missed the mark in so many ways during your visit. I have always made it a point to follow our yelps closely as this is a good way to gauge how we are doing and it provides me a platform to apologize and make things right for anyone who has such a poor experience. Please know that this experience will be reviewed with my team appropriately as I want to ensure nobody ever has an experience like this or hands in their face. I would love to make this up to you and would love to invite you back in to have dinner or brunch on me. I know that we do not deserve a second chance, but if you are willing to I know that we will give you an experience that you will never forgot. Please reach out to my General Manager PJ directly as I will be instructing him on what I would like done to ensure you have the experience you deserve during your next visit. I hope to hear from you soon and truly hope and would love to make this experience right.
