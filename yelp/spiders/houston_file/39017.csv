Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I recommend the 12 hour short ribs to the Hubby and so did Ron our waiter at the bar. It was AMAZING!  I couldn't stop stealing bites!   It LITERALLY melted in your mouth!  The short ribs were resting on delicious, perfectly seasoned potatoes. It had garlic green beans which were nice but not really spectacular. It also had a roasted okra garnish, would have been happy to replace the green beans with that okra..so good. Ron recommended the Snapper in the rye, which was cooked perfectly and the sauce had an Asian flair, it was served on a four or five grain pilaf that was described as fried rice...nope. Not a win. The rice was Nothing special, not fried rice but just a good pilaf, so I was forced to steal another bite of the short ribs. Decided on dessert, because every good meal ends with something sweet!  We ordered the red velvet churros.  The churros themselves were crispy and chocolate coated with a little cinnamon sugar, they were a light delicious red velvet center with the perfect amount of sweetness but sadly the sauce was lacking. I could see where they were going but missed the mark. It was a bland non-descipt sauce, almost a yogurt flavored sauce.  It needed mascarpone or white chocolate, it lacked a richness that would have made the churros something you craved. The tanginess of the sauce wasn't bad it just didn't add anything.  I wanted the sauce to be something you wanted to dip your finger into the cup and eat off your finger it was so yummy but sadly it wasn't that. Call me if you change that sauce . Can't wait to come here again because seriously...get the short ribs
