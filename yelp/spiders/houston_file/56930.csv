Kata Robata////I have been to Kata Robata well over 10 times and I've never wrote a yelp review. However, today deserved one. I ordered the king crab uni spoon, salmon belly, hamachi belly, foie gras and scallop, amberjack and foie gras, Santa Barbara uni, Texas hamachi roll, spicy chopped scallop and Texas Kobe beef.
