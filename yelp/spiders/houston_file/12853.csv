JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Eugene - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. And I'm glad to know our extended wait time wasn't a symptom of "overhype," which is never a good sign for any restaurant. That said, I'm pleased to know you've dined with us on more than one occasion, so thank you again for being a "regular"!
