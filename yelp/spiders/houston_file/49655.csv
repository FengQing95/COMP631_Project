Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have tried 10+ things on the menu and have yet to find something I dislike. My personal favorites are the Bella Bella Benny and the Cinnamon Roll Pancake. The bacon at Snooze is to die for- it is thick and perfectly well cooked, so you can't go wrong ordering something with bacon!
