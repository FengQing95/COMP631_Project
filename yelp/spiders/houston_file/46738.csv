Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok, let me start by saying that I love to try new restaurants and always give a restaurant a couple of tries before posting any reviews.  I was so excited to have a breakfast place in Town & Country and couldn't wait to try it.  It's in a good location and the size of the restaurant is decent and kind of retro.  The coffee is not good, so I recommend getting your coffee at Starbucks right across the parking lot and bringing it over.  :)  I absolutely LOVED the breakfast tacos that have a delicious hollandaise sauce that goes over it that is amazing.  Just makes the whole dish!  I get it on the side so I can put however much/little I want.  I highly recommend the breakfast tacos.  My daughter got a pancake, but it was not done in the middle and her eggs were cold.  We can get past this for the most part but the service is TERRIBLE and there was no wait.  Slow and inattentive so plan on going if you have a lot of time.  Not sure why its so off but I've experienced it the three times I've been.  I would definitely get something to go if I were in the area, but won't go out of my way to go back.
