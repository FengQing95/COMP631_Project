JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very good ramen here. In terms of gourmet ramen, I've only been here and to Ramen Tatsu-ya. JINYA is slightly more expensive than Tatsu-ya, however you get more bang for your buck when adding extra pork belly at JINYA. The noodles are slightly tougher than at Tatsu-ya, and the broth is very savory (I like that, some people dont).
