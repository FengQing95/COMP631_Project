JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Gaby - Thank you for the great review. I'm very pleased to know you enjoyed our ramen. I would like to suggest any of our three "dry noodle" dishes that do not contain broth: Tan Tan Men, Mazemen or Hiyashi Cold Ramen. In terms of pricing, over the years I have visited dozens of ramen shops worldwide, and I have spent anywhere between $8-$20 for a bowl of ramen. What I have learned is that each ramen shop is unique in its own way -- from the noodles and broth they use, to the side dishes they serve, to the price points they target. Here in Midtown, goods and services tend to be on the pricier side.
