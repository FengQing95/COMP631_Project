JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Again, the food was good. While the waitstaff was extremely kind to my gf and I they were extremely rude to the bus boys. We complained the Â to the manager (that was several months ago). He made us believe that it was just a fluke and it is not a normal occurrence. However, I saw the waitstaff once again mistreating and being extremely demeaning to these hard working people.
