Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is open every day from 6:30 am to 2:30 pm. Their automated message will tell you straight away that they don't take reservations nor do they accept call aheads. I arrived at 6:36 on a Sunday morning and there were already 5 people seated and drinking their coffee when I walked in. I found parking without an issue, but beware- by the time my to go order was ready around 7:10, the lot was filling up and all the parallel parking directly in front was taken.
