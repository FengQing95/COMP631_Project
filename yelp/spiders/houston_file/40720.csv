Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came back to provide an update of photos. My rating remains the same, I will always recommend Bosscat for brunch in Houston. The photos I added for are from the two recent times that I went. The short rib chilaquiles were just OK, nothing really wow about them. They just weren't flavorful to me. But the star of the show is the vegetable omelette. I know it sounds super simple but it was so good. From the goat cheese, to the toast, to the micro greens it was excellent. I always appreciate when restaurants do simple items so well. Again, if you're visiting Houston or just looking for a new brunch spot make sure to give Bosscat a try!
