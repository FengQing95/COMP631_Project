Uchi////For starters we order the udamame, which was salted just right. The Uchiviche was one of my favorites of the night. All the ingredients were fresh and crisp. Loved the Zero Sen roll, esp for the sauce! Seemed there was a hint of sesame seeds or sesame seed oil. We also tried the WaluWalu and the Hot Rock beef. Both were good.
