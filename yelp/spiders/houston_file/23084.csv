Uchi////The Hama chili was delicious, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors were to die for... The yellowtail balanced perfectly with the ponzu, thai chili and orange segments. It was in my opinion the best dish of the night. The Karaage (chicken thigh, Sweet chili and seasonal pickle) was just ok, there wasn't anything that really stood out flavor wise from that dish. The shishito peppers were grilled perfectly and was served with a great dipping sauce.
