Uchi////This was absolutely amazing! I always loved salmon, but this killed it for me (in a good way) I literally had a foodgasm on the spot. Our first dish was so fresh and inviting it got me excited for what was to come next. This was definitely some foodplay for our next dish. The salmon was so light and refreshing when combined with the tomatoes and bell peppers.
