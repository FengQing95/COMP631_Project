JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I LOVE THIS RAMEN RESTAURANT! I've been multiple times and each time the service is so incredibly friendly! I think my last servers name was jeff... SORRY IF THATS WRONG AWESOME GUY! Either way, the food is amazing and I always look forward to it. The restaurant is quite small and usually crowded though... I could see that being a downside for a lot of people. Here's a tip! If you have a long wait time the Italian place next door has REALLY awesome bartenders and it's almost never crowded. Go get one of their specialty drinks while you wait for your buzzer to go off!
