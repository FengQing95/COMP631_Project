Baby Barnaby's////The wait was painfully long. (Going back to the beginning about how everyone loves this place.) I saw on the website that certain Barnaby's restaurants serve breakfast during certain time on certain days, so if I were ever to come back, I would definitely try one of those places and avoid the 45-minute wait here.
