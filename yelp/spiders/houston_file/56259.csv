Kata Robata////I really enjoyed the overall ambiance of this place. It has an open floor plan and you can see the sushi chefs from probably anywhere in the restaurant. Our waitress was super attentive and seemed to know the menu really well. This place had a lot of seating for a variety of party-sizes, as well.
