Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was excellent! There are many more trips planned to fully review the menu. I ordered the easiest of things including bacon, eggs and hash browns with a chocolate chip pancake subbed for toast. The eggs were beautifully cooked over easy and the bacon was full and thick, not some thin microwaved bacon. The hashbrowns were perfect and the additional herbs came through perfectly to highlight the potatoes. With perfect potatoes and bacon I was eager to write the review but waited after tasting the pancake. Â The pancake was perrrfect! It really tasted like a cake and had a beautiful crust with a fluffy middle. I would recommend anyone come here for your breakfast destination. If you have family in town then for sure bring them.
