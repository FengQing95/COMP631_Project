JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love that they offer a vegan ramen, it's amazing! I made the mistake of ordering the veggie ramen at first and it's definitely not as tasty. For some reason, two times I ordered the vegan ramen it was room temperature. The first time I didn't mind and just kept eating it but the second time around it was way too cold for me to enjoy so I did mention it to the waitress. They were very kind and made me a new bowl! I think the issue could have been that my bowl was made before my boyfriends and cooled down by the time his ramen was ready. The tofu is too soft and lacks flavor so I omit it in my bowl. Nonetheless, their ramen is delicious!
