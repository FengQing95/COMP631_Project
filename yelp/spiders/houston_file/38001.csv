Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////When I tell you this menu and wine and beer list are amazing, I am not lying! Everything in their menu had a great cocktail, beer or wine to pair with. The food is phenomenal, cocktails are delicious, and they have the best some of the best California wines on their menu, how can you wrong! Best location, especially for our first time in Houston. Oh, and the bartender Brandon took care of us so well, much appreciated!
