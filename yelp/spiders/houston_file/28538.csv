The Pit Room////Y'all...the pit room has some of the most juicy, flavorful BBQ I've ever had! Their hip take on a classic BBQ joint felt super authentic to the Houston foodie scene. I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce, so I really appreciate when restaurants put some effort into their rub game, which the pit room definitely does. I always get the beef taco and an order of chips and queso...and I finish every last bite! The beef is chopped and tender and unlike any BBQ I've ever had. And everything on the menu tastes great to-go, which is a huge plus!
