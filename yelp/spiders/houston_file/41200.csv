Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had my 1st experience today & was not disappointed.  The lengua torta was excellent.  It's tender beef tongue with a spicy BBQ sauce served on fresh baked bread.  This sandwich achieves a level most food does not.  Flavors intermingle & compliment each other delightfully.  It's not just good.  It's great.  I followed my meal with the best pastry I've ever tasted in Houston.  Try the Kouign Amann (pronounced Queen Amon).  It's French puff pastry with caramelized sugar & a rich buttery flavor.  The crazy spelling comes from a regional language called Breton.
