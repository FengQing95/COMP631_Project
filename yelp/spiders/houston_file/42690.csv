Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every.  Thing.  Took.  Way.  Too.  Long.  It was like watching zombies play a particularly taxing game of chess.  This wasn't your normal "we're Texans and we're just slow" slowness.  This was a particularly vexatious slowness reserved for period dramas and hung over sloths.  Customers and counter service where locked in a time sucking vortex without describable purpose or merit.
