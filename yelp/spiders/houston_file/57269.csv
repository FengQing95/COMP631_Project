Kata Robata////Sigh. We tried making omakase reservations on Thursday and were told they had availability for Friday 6:45pm. We show up on time and they seat us at a table. We were confused AF and asked if the omakase experience usually happens at tables and not at the bar, to which our waiter tells us we never made omakase reservations. Apparently the omakase sushi chef was out of town ALL WEEK. This struck a memory in me and I remembered this SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED LAST YEAR. This tells me that the idiot hostess that worked Feb 13th 2018 also worked Apr 4th 2019. A year later and still not fired and still not trained. What a joke of an establishment. I will say though that the hostess that worked Apr 5th was apologetic and explained to us that omakase is reserved weeks in advance. I'll admit the food here is good, but two bad experiences and I've learned my lesson. Never again Kata, never again.
