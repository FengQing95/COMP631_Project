Baby Barnaby's////I live in Montrose but it took me a while to finally come to this great place. Their prices are reasonable and the customer service was very good despite the fact that myself and my family came at a high peak time during Saturday brunch. The food came out very fast and even though the place was packed, our waitress never made us feel like we had to leave to clear the table. I will definitely go here again. When the wait line pours outside, they have big fans to keep everybody cool. And, even though the long lines outside look like something you don't feel like dealing with, the wait is actually very short. Maybe they have little evil trolls in the kitchen stashing people in corners after they finish eating.. Great place, great prices, going in for sure.
