Kata Robata////went on a sunday night to a pretty empty dining room.  daily specials included sea urchin packed in saltwater, butterfish, japanese eji, etc.  everything was super fresh and delicious.  toro sashimi was only $7 and it came in two pieces, super buttery, melt-in-your-mouth-so-you-don't-need-to-chew goodness.
