The Pit Room////The venison sausage is a pretty dense sausage and lean, so don't expect a lot of fat coming from this particular food. The gameness of the meat was very light and the smoke probably hid most of that but it was still good. Not as good as the brisket though. BBQ sauce here is not as tangy as other places and is very well balanced. They also have other sauces like the mustard and a coffee bbq sauce. The coffee will be better off going well with a light meat like chicken or possibly pork. Overall pretty good.
