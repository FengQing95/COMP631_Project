Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came with a few friends and had an amazing night at Bosscat on Friday. Terry is the best server we've encountered on our night's out, he was very knowledgeable about the menu both in food and beverages. The food was delicious and i didnt drink but my friends said the drinks were strong and good. The owner John even came by and introduced himself. There was great music Friday night and I felt very safe because there was two police officers in the place. Overall we had an amazing time. Great food, great atmosphere and great service, we will definitely be back!
