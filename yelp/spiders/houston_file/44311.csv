Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you're not keen on almonds or dark chocolate, then I don't know what to tell you. They do have fruit croissants in rotation, so if they're available when you go, get it! I guess you could also get plain, but I think that'd be very boring. And for $4 per croissant, you need to get something that isn't boring.
