Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the roasted mushroom chilaquiles, which if I had to do it again, I'd spring for including the sunny egg. The presentation was excellent. I quite liked the first few bites, but it was one of those dishes where with each successive bite I grew more disinterested. By the time I reached the two-thirds mark, I wasn't full... I just couldn't face finishing it. I ordered a side of bacon that needed to be patted down - just too greasy. My partner ordered the vegetable omelette, but thought something was a bit off about the taste, and similarly did not finish it. In fairness, one of my friends had the apple cheesecake waffle and plowed right through it with a look of enjoyment.
