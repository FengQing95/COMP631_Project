Kata Robata////A favorite Japanese place in Houston. Sushi is decent and their japanese tapas are mostly excellent. Recently I had this soba noodle salad which I absolutely adored (pictured). My friend loves their ramen and most of my friends in Houston love going to Kata Robata for lunch or dinner. One time, I tasted the beef (wagyu steak?) someone else ordered, it almost blew my mind. Great vibes, Great food at Kata Robata!
