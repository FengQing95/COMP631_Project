The Pit Room////We brought our kids in with us around 1 on a Monday and didn't have to wait too long in line. The gentlemen behind the counter were all really helpful when I asked questions and they suggested a delicious wine for me, and my husband loved their beer selection. They had high chairs for the kids.
