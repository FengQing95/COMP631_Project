Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pork belly (3.5/5): if you're not big on fatty meats, pork belly isn't the right choice for you. I typically stay away from pork belly as well because it's overly fatty for my taste, but overlooking my personal preferences, this was a great dish. The pork belly is marinated in a wonderful Asian sauce and served with a side of kim chi.
