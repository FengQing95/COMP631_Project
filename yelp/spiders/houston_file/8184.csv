JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Cha Cha Garlic Ramen. One sized bowl. The noodles were soft and thick. The broth was flavorful without being too heavy for the tummy. The pork portions were fair. Overall, a satisfied experience in Houston. It wasn't my personal BEST ramen but it was a pretty solid 4/5 overall experience, taste, and pricing.
