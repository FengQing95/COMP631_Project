JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Maddy - Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I apologize for your experience at our restaurant. Since we opened our shop in March 2015, we have received bi-monthly pest control treatment from Ecolab and ABC Pest Control and Home Service per company policy. In addition, we have always received high marks during our routine health inspections by the City of Houston. And lastly, we hire an independent food safety program called Everclean to perform an additional health, cleanliness and safety audit of our restaurant.
