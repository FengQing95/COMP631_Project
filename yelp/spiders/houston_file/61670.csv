Baby Barnaby's////If you're in the Montrose area this little breakfast spot is amazing!!! From the ham steak and eggs which is delicious or the pork chop and eggs with potatoes and wheat toast Â everything on the menu is fresh and extremely good. Don't pass up the freshly squeezed Grapefruit Juice it's so good. All the meats are juicy & not dry . The eggs aren't over cooked & everyone in the environment is normally cool people. The service is always great and I've never had a bad experience here!
