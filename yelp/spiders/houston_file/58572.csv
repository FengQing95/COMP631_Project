Baby Barnaby's////What I like about Baby Barnaby's is that there are interesting breakfast selections.  Yes, you can get the standard french toast and bacon here, but WHY, when you can order "pink eggs"?  Pink eggs, by the way, are bits of salmon and cheese mixed with scrambled eggs, accompanied by a side of potatoes or toast.  You could also get "Green Eggs," which is my personal favorite--eggs with artichoke hearts and avocado scrambled into it.  The coffee is free here, which I recently discovered.  Orange juice is expensive, as orange juice generally is in restaurants, but it is fresh-squeezed!
