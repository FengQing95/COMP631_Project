Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our server was fun and made sure we were taken care of! As with one of the managers, Mark Abitago! Everyone was so nice and attentive, they made sure things were right and to your liking! They also made sure we got our fair share of the bottomless drinks! We had a great experience and will definitely be back for brunch and/or dinner soon!
