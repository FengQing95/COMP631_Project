The Pit Room////Room temperature Tasteless and very greasy charred green beans, dehydrated greasy (not butter) corn, and the worst pc of fatty meat. It was smoked well I will give them that. But My money and my appetite could have been better tended to in a McDonalds drive-thru with a 42$ donation to Charity to boot. And I don't even like McD. I am still upset at almost midnight now and hungry too.
