Uchi////Uchi is amazing!  My husband and I came for dinner and ordered the chef's selection. We sat at the bar, so we had a great conversation going with the sushi chef - very friendly and entertaining.  He asked us what kinds of food we do not eat and tailored the food selection towards our palette.
