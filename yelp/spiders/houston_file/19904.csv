Uchi////This is not your typical sushi restaurant. Instead they're trying to be gourmet. I'm ok with gourmet restaurants having some sashimi or other type of Asian flair but when you try to completely change the sushi experience into something hipster or in this case pretentious you better knock it out of the park. In this case they got everything almost right but in the end they fell short. Houston has so many great sushi restaurants, no need to go here unless you're not really in the mood for sushi.
