The Pit Room////I live a block away and have to smell the wonderful BBQ every morning. Staff is friendly and food is great. If you want to eat well seasoned & cooked BBQ this is the place for you.  Sadly, I am only eating grass beef now so I can only eat there on cheat days.   Any idea if you guys plan to offer grass fed beef?
