Uchi////Update: came back again for a friend's birthday. The food was still great, but this time around we ordered more meats and fewer seafood dishes, and my overall opinion/memory is that it was wayyy too salty. I know this place is fusion, but Japanese dishes tend to be on the light side, so that was disappointing. Nevertheless, still the best sushi I've had in Houston, still love this place, will still come back!
