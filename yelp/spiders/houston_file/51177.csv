Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were starving so each ordered 2-3 things each. My favorites were the blueberry danish pancake, sweet potato pancake, drunken monkey French toast, chiliquilies Benedict, Bella Bella (prosciutto and taleggio) Benedict, and chili verde Benedict. Their pancakes were huge ($4 for one pancake) and very light/fluffy. Each Benedict comes with a different kind of toast instead of the normal English muffin, which I usually think is too heavy. For vegan/vegetarian diners their quinoa breakfast bowl with sriracha broth and assorted vegetables/ mushrooms is a really good option as well!
