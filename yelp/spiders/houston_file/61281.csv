Baby Barnaby's////Had to wait about ten minutes to be sat but it was worth it because greatness waited for me. I had the chicken and waffles with powdered sugar and chicken apple sausage and a hot chocolate in this cold weather and my day has been made. They were very friendly and respectful and made sure everything I needed came to me in a time appropriate manner. I will be coming back to try every item on the menu when I have time!
