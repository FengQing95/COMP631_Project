Uchi////For you who can't restrain yourself in the presence of a good oyster, the ichigo oyster is a very good oyster. I shot it and pronounced it among the top two oysters I've ever eaten. Maybe now I'd even be willing to give it top billing- the tartness of the early season strawberry flowed through the whole bite, but the sweetness hit the mouth at the end, leaving the oyster itself to shine on first bite. A very thoughtful dish.
