Kata Robata////Tried this place for the first time tonight. What a great spot!! Service was great, we tried two rolls, they were both so good!!! We had the Kobe beef dish, also amazing, kind of something you can't skip on it you come here. We also got the lobster Mac n cheese, which is another staple you can't pass on, delish!!! We did get the green tea cheesecake, which we didn't care for. We also got the coffee and donuts dessert, which tasted wonderful! Looking forward to visiting again!
