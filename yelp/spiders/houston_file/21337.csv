Uchi////I finally decided to write a review for Uchi after visiting multiple times. My wife and I moved to the Houston area a little over a year ago, and Uchi has become our favorite restaurant. We are frequently searching Yelp and trying out new restaurants, but Uchi has remained our favorite place with it's unique and outstanding dishes.
