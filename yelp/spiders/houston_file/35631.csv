Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went for the brunch and it was so so good!!! The bartenders and staff were all extremely hospitable and upbeat. The only drawback was that the live band during brunch is a little on the loud side so as long as that doesn't bother you then plan to go hungry and leave happy!
