Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Just had brunch at Bosscat for the first time and it was an amazing experience. The ambience is so cool and they have great music and lots of fun people. The food was eclectic and amazing. I had the pork belly tacos and they were unexpectedly delicious.  The best part of the experience was our server TERRY he had some awesome recommendations and he made the whole experience memorable. Visiting Houston from Philadelphia and I would definitely recommend it nationwide.  Be sure to ask for him when you come.  He will definitely take care if you.
