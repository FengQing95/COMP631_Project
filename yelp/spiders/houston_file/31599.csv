Local Foods////The second time we went, my husband and I shared the Banh MI sandwich.  Wow! This sandwich I would definitely order again!  It was so flavorful, and in a way reminded me of a much better french dip sandwich.  Half the sandwich and one side was plenty of food, and I left full but not stuffed.
