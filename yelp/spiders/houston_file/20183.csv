Uchi////Surprising amount of divisive opinions about this one. Noticed some complaints about the sushi... gosh, you folks are a riot. All the sushi joints in Houston and you go to Uchi for your nigiri fix? I thought it was about experiencing their innovative omakase tastings, the thing that earned them their reputation... but what the heck do I know.
