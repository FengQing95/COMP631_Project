Local Foods////One of my favorite restaurants in Houston. I order it multiple times whenever I'm in town. My go to order is either the crunchy chicken sandwich or the truffled egg salad sandwich. Both come on a pretzel bun, have fresh ingredients are unique and packed with flavor. They also come with two side of your choice, I usually get house-made chips and the Tuscan kale salad or a side of fruit. I believe you can also order a cup of soup instead. This is a place I take everyone that comes to visit houston too! A must try in my opinion.
