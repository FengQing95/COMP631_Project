Kata Robata////Met some girlfriends for lunch on a Sunday and the door was stormed right at noon when it opened. The menu has a lot of options and it was easy to get overwhelmed. I had the mango pork belly salad, the Caribbean roll, and the longhorn roll. By far the longhorn was my favorite. The place is pricy and it adds up quick- hence doing rolls and not sashimi. I'd recommend going with a group of people that like to share- get a bit of everything.
