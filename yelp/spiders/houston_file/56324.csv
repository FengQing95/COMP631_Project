Kata Robata////Requested to be at the patio...very nice and more quiet than inside dining. Happy hour menu available until 630pm. We ordered fresh ceviche (pretty presentation, nothing special abt it), fried brussell's sprouts (not quite as good as Uchi's but close), agedashi tofu, and spicy salmon roll. Everything came out on time except for the spicy tuna roll...we had to ask for them 2x and myself and a friend are almost done w our main dish before the salmon rolls my son ordered with the appetizers came out. I had the spicy soy ramen which never disappoints, great soup base, spiciness is moderate for my taste, serving size is good enough for 2 people (esp after the appetizers).
