Local Foods////I almost always get the Vegan Chili as my side.  The first time I had it, I was a little skeptical (usually my inner carnivore and "vegan" don't get along too well), but I was sold with the first spoonful.  Even if you're a meat eater, definitely give it a shot - it's full of flavor, and really accompanies the sandwiches nicely!
