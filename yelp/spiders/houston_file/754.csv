JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The pork bones we use for our Tonkotsu broth come from California, as we are required to use premium, Â organically raised pigs. And the water we use in our broths come from a Fuji-water filtration system that requires monthly servicing. This filtration system constantly adjusts the PH of incoming water to give the best PH balance for our broths.
