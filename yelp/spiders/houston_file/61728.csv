Baby Barnaby's////I enjoyed coming here. This place can get packed easily so the best time to go is bright and early in the morning. We got a corner booth seat and I absolutely enjoyed it. It was very quiet and cozy. The food was great. I had the banana walnut pancake! Great price for the amount of food you get!
