JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alex - Thanks for the 5 stars! I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. Your descriptions of our food are spot on, and we are pleased you can appreciate some of the subtleties of our dishes. In regards to the chili paste we use to make a ramen dish spicy -- the chili paste contains more than a dozen different ingredients, and takes quite some time to prepare in large quantities (we use it for all the ramens that are served spicy by default). In essence, it is vastly different from the spicy sauce you'll find on the dining tables. Perhaps the best analogy is asking for sour cream at a Tex-Mex restaurant.
