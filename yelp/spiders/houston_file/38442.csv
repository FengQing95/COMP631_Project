Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was the first spot I bookmarked to try in Houston and finally dropped in.  Their Old Fashioned is on point -- thanks, Brandon, for asking which bourbon to customize it with -- I recommend the Wild Turkey 101.  The steak is amazing. Thanks also to Dan for some great recs for local Mexican restaurant to try while I'm in town.  Good bartenders are a precious thing!  I can't wait to return and try the actual Bosscat.
