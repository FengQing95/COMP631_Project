Kata Robata////We weren't impressed by the food. We ordered the A5 wagyu special, grilled octupus, scallop foie gras, rising sun roll, beef skewers, and green tea cheesecake to finish it off. The menu is a little pricey but we were willing to pay the price for exceptional food. We were disappointed. The food looked elevated and the ingredients seemed fresh but everything tasted monotonous, boring, and one-dimensional and left us unsatisfied. Nothing we had was memorable. We actually ended our dinner early and grabbed some more food elsewhere.
