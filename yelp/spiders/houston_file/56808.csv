Kata Robata////My fianc√© and I came on a busy night so I understood that the atmosphere felt crowded and chaotic instead of a pleasant environment, but the kicker was burnt appetizers (brussel sprouts I believe). If we're dropping some serious cash for a "fancy sushi" dinner instead of just grabbing cheap mediocre sushi, I expect the appetizers to be delicious, not burnt.
