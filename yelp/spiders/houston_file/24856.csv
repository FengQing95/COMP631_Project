Uchi////Had our early Valentine's dinner here and of course had the ten course chef's Omakase. The food was spectacular and we were really full at the end. We got super lucky and ended up with an extra dessert on the house because of our great waitress Dusty! Â If you've been here before then you know the food is spectacular and If you haven't then what are you waiting for?!
