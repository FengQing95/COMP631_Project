Local Foods////Delicious and healthy lunch spot specializing in gourmet sandwiches and calorie friendly sides. Â My favorites here are the Truffled Egg Salad sandwich and the Falafel (which wasn't being served at this location on my last visit). Both sandwiches are really extraordinary and it's hard to find anything like them elsewhere. The pretzel bun really makes the truffled egg salad sandwich bringing a nice salty compliment to the savory nature of the truffle oil. I was cautious about ordering this sandwich initially but my doubts are gone now. Other people I've met there have raved about other sandwiches and salads so I would feel confident ordering pretty much anything. Almost everyone that goes there for the first time orders the Crunchy Chicken sandwich (including me). I can only assume this is because it looks like the most "normal" thing on the menu. I thought it was relatively unimpressive compared to what else is being served here and not actually very crunchy. I haven't ordered it again and maybe I just had a bad sandwich but with so many other tasty choices I haven't wanted to try it again.
