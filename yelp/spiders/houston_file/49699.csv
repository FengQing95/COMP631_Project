Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You shouldn't wait 40 minutes for eggs and pancakes to arrive and then for them to be cold! And then literally hunting down your waitress for a coffee refill. People come to restaurants because they want to be served, otherwise you get it to go or cook yourself. 60 total minutes to order and receive two egg plates when you are 70% full on a weekday brunch time is beyond unacceptable
