Uchi////I LOVE Uchi - even as a vegetarian! This place has a huge amount of options, even a separate vegetarian menu. It's pricey (but worth it), but the key is to go for happy hour! You'll probably wait a while (like you will at any time), but all the prices are reduced. It will still be more expensive than your average meal out... but it's also a way more special experience than your average meal out! Go with a group of friends and just order a ton of stuff to share. Delicious, fresh vegetables with amazing flavors and everything is prepared beautifully. The drinks are awesome. The service is also fantastic! The servers are so kind and interactive and knowledgable when you have any questions about the menu. When I went for happy hour with three friends, there was a delay with one of the plates we ordered. We weren't bothered by it at all because we had so much other delicious food already and didn't mind waiting a little longer, but the staff "made it up" to us by bringing us two free dessert plates once we were finished with our meal! They were DELICIOUS, and we were just so happy and not expecting that at all. Overall an amazing experience, definitely worth treating yourself to coming here! :)
