Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every meal I have ever had from Common Bond has been great. I recommend the French dip or grilled cheese sandwich. You can't go wrong with their tomato soup either. Also, their eggs Benedict and brunch meals are solid. The location is a bit difficult to find parking, but better right now to get meals delivered or curbside.
