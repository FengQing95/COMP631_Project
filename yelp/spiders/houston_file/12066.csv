JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service was good, but that was about it. Kids meal has WAY too much food for a kid. Ordered the shrimp wonton ramen and it had no flavor. The crispy chicken didn't have any flavor unless it was dipped in soy sauce. Spicy tuna taco filling was good, but the shells tasted a bit stale. Highly disappointed.
