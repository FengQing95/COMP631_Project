Uchi////Neon sign outside the restaurant: Japanese inspired - yup, that's what you're getting! If you're looking for real Japanese food then you'll be highly disappointed. All I could taste was salt, chilli oil and citrus - no hint of fresh fish anywhere. And I really shouldn't expect seafood flown into Houston would stay fresh...the Hokkaido sea urchin was not fresh at all...skunk-y would be the word to describe not so fresh sea urchins...and at $12 a pop, you're much better off getting something else from their hot foods section or dessert - both were quite tasty.
