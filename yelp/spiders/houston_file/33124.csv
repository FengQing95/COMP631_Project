Local Foods////Holy Moley. Gourmet sandwich to the max. Soft buttery brie? Duck poached in its own fat? You, too, can be fancy. And it does taste good as leftovers out of the fridge. Rather Thanksgiving-y. But probably better than your grandma's turkey.   Again, perfect example of how Local takes classic flavors and amps them up a notch.
