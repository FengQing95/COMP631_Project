Baby Barnaby's////Every time we have friends/family visiting Houston we take them here without fail. There is an option for everyone on the menu and prices are great; I personally recommend the green eggs and substitute biscuits for the toast - you won't be disappointed! The outdoor patio area is covered; we love eating outside. Sometimes there is a wait, but the cafe is located on a cute local neighborhood corner and they have an outdoor coffee station which lends itself to easy/comfortable conversation while you wait. Our favorite breakfast spot in Houston!!!
