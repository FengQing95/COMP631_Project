JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Crystal - Thank you for your excellent review. First and foremost, I regret the mix-up at the host stand when you arrived. Our hosts' job is probably the toughest -- and most thankless -- job in our restaurant, and our hosts handle, literally, hundreds of people every day. Just last weekend, more than 1,000 people ate at JINYA over the course of 15 hours. Our hosts worked very hard to accommodate everyone in a fair and timely fashion, and please keep in mind that JINYA has 89 seats. But, unfortunately, mistakes happen. We are all fallible humans, but we also try to fix our errors in the moments in which they happen.
