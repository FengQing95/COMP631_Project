JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best ramen bar in Houston! The food comes out pretty fast. I went on Saturday night and there was a short wait. The tonkatsu and spicy chicken ramen is very flavorful and delicious ! Their side dishes are also amazing. I wish I had room for everything. I recommend their pork belly buns, salmon sashimi , and crispy chicken!
