JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What an amazing with great ambience. Service was so fast and we were seated in 15 min even though it was packed. If you come time around 7 then parking is not an issue. Loved the decor. I am certainly going there again. Very reasonable prices of the dishes. Very satisfied with the whole experience. Some clicks of the ambience.
