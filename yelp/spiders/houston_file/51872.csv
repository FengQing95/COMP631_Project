Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There was a bright spot though. I was served a free cinnamon roll pancake which isn't on the menu but if you have a sweet tooth you need to try. It was delicious. The two things that saved my experience was the pancake and the service which were both A1. I will come back but for now I would say 3-stars.
