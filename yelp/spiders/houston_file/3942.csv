JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am so glad I came here! Even at 9 o'clock at night the place was packed and we had to wait to be seated. We got a drink at the bar and looked over the ramen choices while we waited. We sat in the bar area near the back of the restaurant where you can watch them cook the noodles. I loved the experience and hearing the sounds of them cooking. I ordered the tonkatsu spicy ramen bowl and was very satisfied. We also ordered the pork chashu tacos with kimchee, pork gyoza (6 pieces), and green tea mochi ice cream. Overall it was a great atmosphere and I loved all the food. It came out quickly and the service was fantastic. I can't wait to go back again!
