Uchi////This place is a shadow of what it was when it began in Austin. The food is overall good, but the brussel sprouts are over charred and the portions are as tiny as every and a bit more expensive. Also the new peanut butter semifreddo is not interesting and barely palatable. The service used to be on point and informative. Now it is discombobulated with wrong information and significantly delayed dishes.
