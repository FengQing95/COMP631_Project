Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Also the pancakes! They are so huge and they are so warm and delicious. No need for maple syrup. It has enough flavor. Last time I had a pomegranate white chocolate chip almond pancake. Today I had a cinnamon roll white chocolate chip pancake. As full as I was, I could not stop eating my pancake. So warm, toasty, and it had almond crunch on top. It was perfect. My boyfriend will get the OMG French Toast on top of his Bella Bella Benny (eggs benedict) and he says its the best french toast he has ever eaten. I will say my boyfriend and I are not big "brunch" or "breakfast" persons when it comes to eating out for it, but for snooze we order like Kings and Queens. Its worth it. You have to try it. See for yourself.
