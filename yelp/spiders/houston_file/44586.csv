Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The man at the cashier had great personality but his personality was so much better than the product that came out. The lady clearing thr tables took everything... like Â napkins abd sweetner.... I was going to return it since i didnt use it but she wanted to trash it. Such waste.
