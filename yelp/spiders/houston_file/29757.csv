The Pit Room////Neither the brisket or the pork sausage in the plate were very memorable, and the coleslaw was just okay as well. There didn't seem to be much in the way of traditional BBQ sauce here, which may just be this restaurant's style, but I missed it. The Mac and cheese was sadly the best part of the plate.
