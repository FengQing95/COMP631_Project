Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We really enjoyed the whiskey cocktails and the variety of choices. Loved the various sandwiches but the Cuban like sandwich meat was a bit dry. Salads were excellent and vibe was nice. They were out of a couple of choice items on the menu which was a bit disappointing. Venue seemed a bit loud but service was excellent and prompt - honestly the best we've had in awhile. Four stars because we aren't sure we'd go back but overall great spot!
