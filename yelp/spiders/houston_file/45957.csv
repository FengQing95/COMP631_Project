Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was concerned that quality and customer care would drop off when ownership changed hands but what the new regime have improved everywhere in all ways.  What I mean by that simple things such as changing the seating arrangement to allow for more seating and better flow.  They've expanded their hours now to extend to 9 p.m. (8 p.m. on Sundays).  The biggest benefit is Common Bond has expanded their menu on breakfast, specialty dishes, i.e. DUCK AND WHITE BEAN RAGOUT, BEEF BOURGUIGNON, etc., Tartines, Sandwhiches, & Salads all to the benefit and delight of their patrons.  BUT, lets not forget their core business is pastries and coffee.  Each time I come here or reflect back when they first opened this place has really grown their sweet desserts and pastries from the early days and they're selling them off the hook busy.
