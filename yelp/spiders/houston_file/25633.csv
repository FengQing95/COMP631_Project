Uchi////It has been years since I've been back to this restaurant and Ofcourse they do not ever disappoint. I went during their daily happy hour from 4-6. We ordered both vegetarian and regular happy hour menu. Each piece was full of flavor and packed with amazing texture to boost the taste. The service was great! I did not make a reservation but I was able to be seated right away by the bar. Place was packed so I recommend to make a reservation. I must go back again and try their regular menu.
