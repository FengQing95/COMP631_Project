Uchi////Why still 5 stars if I weeded out so many new dishes?  Service, service, service.  Staff went above and beyond in helping make my congrats dinner special (using themed plates under the amuse bouche, complimentary dessert-Orange Blossom Okashi in the end, and overall trying to cater to our favorite flavors).
