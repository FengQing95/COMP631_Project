Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started off with the Pig Candy and oh my word... it did not disappoint!!! Incredibly delicious and succulent starter. I had the Power Spinach salad and my husband took a recommendation to try the Bosscat burger chef's way. His burger was tremendous and he said it was delicious. My salad was huge and hit the spot. The roasted pears and grapes added a very nice sweet touch to the salad without being too sweet and the balsamic dressing was perfect.
