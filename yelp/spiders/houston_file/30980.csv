The Pit Room////I came here after a friend gave me a handful of his favorite bbq spot in Houston so here's a shout-out to Justine T I appreciate it brother. I arrived here with pretty high expectations after reading the reviews and viewing the photos from a number of my Yelp friends, with the traffic in Houston being what it is I was glad to see this location was in close proximity to the hotel I was staying. I was able to find a parking space without much trouble and I was glad to see there were no lines wrapping around the building and that I was able to walk right up and place my order. The staff here was extremely friendly and it's obvious they love what they do - I was tempted to order the beef rib but decided to try an assortment to get a real feel of their version of Texas bbq and I wasn't Â disappointed. I went with the triple meat platter and two sides. I love that the carving station is right in front of you and watching my portions of meats pile up right in front of me was definitely part of the overall experience. Bbq is not cheap and quality always comes at a price so it wasn't a factor I needed my bbq fix.
