Baby Barnaby's////When I feel like getting out my habitual routine, I've ordered the Green Eggs with no cheese (lactose intolerant) and the Bob's Healthy Plate. Both are delish. The salsa is spot on. The chicken apple sausage tastes like Thanksgiving in your mouth (seriously, I can only eat half it's so rich). And the amount of food on your plate for the price cannot be beat.
