Local Foods////Local Foods is a sandwich place. But it's not really a sandwich place. It's not like... Jimmy John's. Or Subway. Hell nah. It's a fresh hip cool liberal local organic innovative sandwich place. (I don't really know if they use organic ingredients, but it feels like they do. It's the thought that counts.) And the clientele reflects this - it's a bunch of young 20-something college students and yuppies. So to contrast their chic-ness, I'm going to keep this review gritty and vulgar.
