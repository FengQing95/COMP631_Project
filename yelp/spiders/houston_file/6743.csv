JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's worth calling ahead on weekends, as the restaurant is relatively compact and can fill up quickly with hungry twenty-somethings (open til 2 AM on Fridays and Saturdays). There are stand-alone tables along the sides that accommodate groups of 2 or 4, but larger parties will have to make do with communal seating at the center. While sitting next to strangers might not be ideal, at least the scenery is cool, with low-hanging tungsten lamps, lengthy mirrors, and beds of white rocks.
