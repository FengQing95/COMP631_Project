Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Update: While all menu items aren't created equally, I'm still a huge fan of the tomato soup! But, to give a nod to other stars on the menu, the Benedicts are all delightful, as is the breakfast pot pie...add some fun meats to it for a really filling and fulfilling meal!  Shout out to Theresa who works the AM shift behind the bar/coffee bar, and to Johnny Taco for their amazing service.  Star employees like them are why you really keep coming back and bring family and friends. :))
