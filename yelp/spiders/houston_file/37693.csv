Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Too noisy and loud. Burger was good, but tried to go here again and both times I could not hear what my friend was saying across the table. Music is too loud, it's not a club, I get it, it's the Galleria area, but please help make the dining experience enjoyable by keeping the music at a lower volume.
