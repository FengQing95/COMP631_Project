Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We sat next to the kitchen, so we were able to witness firsthand how inefficient the kitchen was. I have never worked in a kitchen, so I might not know what I am talking about. But I'm pretty sure it's not a good sign when food only leaves the kitchen every 5-10 minutes in this large of a restaurant and servers are crowding the front of the kitchen waiting for entrees to deliver. I went to the bathroom and saw 6 empty tables. Surprising, considering how many people were waiting to be seated. I think they intentionally left some tables empty since the kitchen was backed up.
