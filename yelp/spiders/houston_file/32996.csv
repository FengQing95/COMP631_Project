Local Foods////I had the falafel sandwich with beets and kale. The falafel was without a doubt the worst falafel I've ever had (I guess I should have expected as much.. that's like ordering a hamburger at a Mediterranean restaurant). Part of the charm of falafel is the texture contrast: the crunchy, deep-fried exterior encasing a smooth garlicky, cumin-y chickpea mash. The falafel here only hit the mash notes. There was no texture to speak of. Plus, the taste of the sandwich was completely one-dimensional acid.
