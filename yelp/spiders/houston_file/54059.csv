Kata Robata////Lastly, we asked Misty to spilt the check in 3 but she forgot and gave us one check. So one of my friend volunteered to pay and when Misty came back for the check and the card, (well she didn't come back, we had to GET HER ATTENTION again and let her know that it was ready) one of my other friend said "you forgot to split it in 3, you just gave us one check but it's ok, I just wanted to let you know"
