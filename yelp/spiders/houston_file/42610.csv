Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of the cutest little spots in town! The amount of treats and bakery items is unreal and so delicious! They serve a variety of mimosas as well as other beverages. The food was delicious my friends had different flat breads and I had the sausage sandwich and everything was perfect.
