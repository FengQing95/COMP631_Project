JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////All day I felt sick and wanted to lift up my spirits by enjoying a nice hot soup. Like all Asian restaurants you always receive a good amount of food worth the amount of money you spend, however having been here more than 10 times every single time I've notice the portion of broth and food they give you does not justify the huge bowl they give you. The amount of soup I received was about 25% of the overall bowl. The portion was a little bit, and being sick I wanted to have broth to soothe my throat so I asked the waitress and she insisted on charging me $3.50 extra for additional broth which I paid for even though she had a slight attitude and did not show any empathy for how I was feeling. JINYA is a decent restaurant and has a great amount of business but they are really frugal with their portions, it's not filling, and they lie to you by giving you a huge bowl but a little bit of soup.
