Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wow this place exceeded my expectations. This is one of those places I would 100% recommend for everyone! First off, the staff was super friendly and very attentive to any of our needs. Caden was one of the guys that worked there and he talked to us the entire time and had very positive energy. You could tell he really loved his job and he loved making customers feel like they were at home! The coffee was by far the best tasting coffee I've ever had! My friend and I tried the caramel and vanilla latte and they were both excellent. The pastries and baked goods have the prettiest presentation and they also taste amazing! I ordered the beef hash for breakfast and my god it was delicious. The atmosphere and crowd is also really cool. Check this place out for breakfast/brunch or just a quick coffee and pastry to go!
