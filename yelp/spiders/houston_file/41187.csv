Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered a cup of soup and the charred romaine salad, while my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was the one positive part of our experience - the bread was delicious as was the sriracha bbq sauce. My potato soup came, which was fine. Unremarkable. While I was waiting for my salad to come, a sous chef comes over and tells me that the chef isn't pleased with how the salad is turning out and won't be serving it. This is fine, and I respect a chef's decision not to send out sub-par food. However, there wasn't really a good substitute on the menu. I already had my cup of soup, and I just wanted a salad. After looking over the limited options (it's a small menu) she suggested the fried eggplant side dish.
