JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My only complaint was how pushy the service was. Bus boys came to clear our dishes while we were clearly still eating. I actually had to place my hand over my bowl to restrain the bus boy from taking the dish after I told him I was still enjoying my meal. Our server brought our check shortly thereafter and while I was still eating and before we had a chance to order desert.
