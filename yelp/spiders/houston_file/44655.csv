Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The service and lack of variety kind of blend together in my experience. Like I said before, my friend and I weren't really in the mood for anything sweet, so we were evaluating our options in front of one of the staff members behind the counter. I pointed out the savory scone, and we thought about it for a little bit before asking the staff member what her suggestions were for a more savory option. She just said, "well there's the savory scone." Lol. She probably didn't mean it rudely but it kinda came off condescendingly, and also we were surprised that they didn't have quiche or any other traditional savory pastry besides the scone and the bialy.
