The Pit Room////Texas BBQ at it's finest. You can tell the second you drive up... stacks and stacks of seasoned firewood out front, pits along the side of the building, porch along the front of the building, scarce parking because it's all taken up by the customers standing in line. The line never ends even so the service is fast, but folks just keep coming and coming and once you eat here, you will know why.
