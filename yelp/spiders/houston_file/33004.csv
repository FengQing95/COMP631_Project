Local Foods////I really wanted to give a this place a lower star..... But, fine. Hippies and granola unite!  The name deterred me but the food, atmosphere and location will bring me back. As stated in my tip, they offered us their signature drink which was AHmazing, and free certainly helped, but I am certainly suckered into buying it next time. I had the crunchy chicken sandwich and my wife had the Asian salad and both were very good, fresh and relatively inexpensive.  We we t at a random time so service was fast but I can imagine this place being packed during regular lunch hours.
