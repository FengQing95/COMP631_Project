Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After a rough weekend this place was EXACTLY what I needed. Amazing food, and the drinks are perfection. Our server Terry made a recommendation on drinks based on our likes and got it just right! The service here is stellar, big shout out to Terry for knowing his stuff and making it such an enjoyable experience! Well for sure be back! Try the Mac & cheese you won't regret it.
