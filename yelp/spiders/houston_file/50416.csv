Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On the other hand, the French toast was a bit of a let-down. The outside wasn't as visibly toasted and the inside wasn't nearly as soft as I was expecting. Did y'all soak ya bread? The whole selling point of French toast is getting that perfect balance between the chewiness of the thick bread and soaking it to the point it's soft but not soggy. I got neither of these components and will not be getting this again. Waste your calories on pancakes, people.
