Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////All my life, I've heard about Snooze. I think it is one of the most popular places for brunch in Houston. We got the sweet potato hash and the Sandwich I Am. The breakfast sandwich was good; the pretzel bun was one of the best part about that sandwich. To be honest, we've had better breakfast sandwiches, but I did hold a higher expectation for the food due to the glowing reviews on Yelp and through word of mouth.
