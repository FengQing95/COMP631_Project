Local Foods////The Garden Sammie is amazing! It comes with two sides , it's a lot of food! I'm able to split it into two meals. They use hummus as the spread and the sandwich has Brussel sprouts, tomato, pickled onion, romaine lettuce, cauliflower, sprouts, and avocado spread. It's definitely a vegetarians dream!
