The Pit Room////I had the brisket and jalapeno sausage. They were both delicious. The jalapeno sausage isn't that spicy but I was let down that it was cold. The brisket was great. I had the Mac n cheese and green beans and highly recommend both. We got there at 1115 and there was no line, that's always a plus.
