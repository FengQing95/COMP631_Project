JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The most entertaining part of the meal was when I ordered a strawberry Ramune drink. The waiter told me it's a Japanese soft drink which tastes like sprite. Let's just say it's the most unique bottle I've ever seen. It's a little tough to put into the words but you take off the cap and use it to puncture the top of your drink. This leads to a little ball falling in your drink which causes it to fizz. To further add to the madness, the bottle kind of looks like a baby bottle. #FlashbackFriday to the days when we were all chugging bottles of milk. A+ for creativity.
