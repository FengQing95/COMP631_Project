JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The customer service ambiance and drinks weregreat which is why I give 3 stars but both my boyfriend and I were disappointed by this ramen experience. We ordered the Chicken and Spicy Chicken Ramens. The broth was super salty, the chicken texture was not great (seemed processed) and the add ons were not fresh. Our quest for fresh and yummy ramen continues ‚Äç I would only recommend Jinya as a happy hour spot post-Covid
