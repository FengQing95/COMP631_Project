JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen. I don't really like to eat pork so I was so happy to find a delicious non-pork option. I got it "spicy" so I expected it to be a tad more spicier- or at least sweat from how fast I was eating it in 91-degree weather. So if you like spice, get it "hot" or their hotter options. Nonetheless, the broth was amazingggg !!
