Uchi////Service was of the high standard I expected, and I spied Tyson Cole meticulously going over every detail. Oh the details; every course is explained, and then discussed after they take the plate away. Utensils magically appear and disappear as needed. Water remains full. "Pardon my reach" seems to be a mantra. The staff is unfailingly polite as well as Texan-friendly. Service plus food made three spectacular dining hours fly by.
