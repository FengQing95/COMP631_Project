Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got some food from Snooze AM to go brought to me by a vendor. WOW this is the best breakfast ever! I had the pineapple upside down pancakes and the french toast. I immediately started texting my friends and family to tell them how good the food was. I can't wait to check this place out, I saw the pictures of the pancake flight and I'm so excited to try it!
