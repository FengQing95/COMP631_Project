Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////What can I say,  their pancakes are to die for and their staff is really friendly. Not exaggerating when I say they have the best bacon in town! My go-to is the Snooze Classic, that's eggs with a choice of breakfast meat, served with hash browns and toast. More than half of the time I pay a little extra to substitute the toast for the pineapple upside down pancakes! Trust me, once you've had them you'll always be looking forward to them too haha. Even if you have to wait to be seated the wait time is definitely worth it! Although,  if you're by yourself or eating with a pal I do recommend sitting at the bar. Finding a spot in their parking lot can be tricky, but parking along side Lovett boulevard is just as easy and never more than a two minute walk.
