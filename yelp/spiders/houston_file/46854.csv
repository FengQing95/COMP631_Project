Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////BEST BREAKFAST IN HOUSTON. I live out of town in Florida and hate that we don't have Snooze here yet. Every time my boyfriend and I make it to Houston, we make sure to make this our first eating spot of our trip. Yeah the wait and parking situation can suck, but it is 110% worth it. Can't talk enough about my love for Snooze. :)
