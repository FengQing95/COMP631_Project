Local Foods////Local Foods in Rice Village had a special today : It was the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich , The sandwich was made to perfection from the crispy onions to the cilantro-jalape√±o slaw to the succulent pork . You can't go wrong. It's a great price for what I got. My sides were Cous Cous and Quinoa. Matched with the Mintade to wash down everything. I felt like I was in Food Heaven. Most Def. Recommend this place.
