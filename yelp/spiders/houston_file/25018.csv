Uchi////Albert quickly greeted us and congratulated us on the 2 year milestone. He recommended us special things to order that they don't get often. The food, as always is phenomenal. But what you don't hear on many reviews is how phenomenal the PEOPLE are. Each sushi chef engages their guests, they genuinely care about you and want you to have a great experience. Albert asked us if we had any allergies, was hilarious the entire time we were with him, and actually cared if we were having a good time. We had just missed social hour but he made sure to get us what we wanted in time before it officially ended. He also had solid suggestions for us such as the rabbit, gizzard, and some other items that were just too good for words. The desserts here are also insane - we had the fried milk and a peanut butter mousse.
