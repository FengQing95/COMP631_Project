Baby Barnaby's////Great food, reasonable price and good for groups but only for about 6 or less. Be prepared to wait a while because of its popularity and the small space. It usually differs from 25-45 depending on the day. The staff was also sweet and attentive. Definitely recommend to try at least one time!
