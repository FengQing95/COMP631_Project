Uchi////I never got the chance to try them out in Austin but I made the first available reservations when they finally came to Houston. After reviewing the entire menu, my boyfriend and I decided to stay away from the "typical" makis and order what other sushi places don't have to offer. If you're one to order California rolls, Shaggy dog, and the like (not that there's anything wrong with them), you're better off saving your money and going to Miyako. The food exceeded my highest expectations. Uchi is truly a fine dining experience. Once the food is brought out, the runner/waiter will explain the best way to eat the dish and exactly what the dish consists of.
