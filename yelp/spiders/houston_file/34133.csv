Local Foods////Went for lunch with three friends. I got the crunchy chicken sandwich with the 2 sides of couscous and cabbage slaw. Everything was nice and fresh. The crunchy chicken wasn't fried chicken - the crunch was provided by bacon. I tried some of my friends' food and would recommend the gulf shrimp one along with the potato salad and the mintade drink.
