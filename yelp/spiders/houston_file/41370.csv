Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am IN LOVE with this place.  The bread is phenomenal, and every single food item and baked good I have tried has been wonderful.  The coffee is fantastic, definitely on par with the other coffee shops I have tried in Houston.  If you have not tried this place, GO THERE RIGHT NOE. This is the place to go for foodies and coffee aficionados alike!
