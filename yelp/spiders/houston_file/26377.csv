The Pit Room////Delicious! Their brisket basically melts in your mouth and the price is not expensive for how much quality food you get. However, I would stay away from the coleslaw as it was very mediocre especially compared to the rest of the sides they offer. They also offer homemade ice cream sandwiches that are great as well. Overall fantastic BBQ joint in the Houston Area!
