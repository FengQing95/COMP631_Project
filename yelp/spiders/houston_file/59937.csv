Baby Barnaby's////Got here around 11:30 and waited about 45 minutes for a table of 4. The food wasn't as expected from all the hype I've heard about this spot. I had the corned beef I've the potatoes which was okay, kind of dry. However, I did try the biscuits that were amazing along with the green eggs. Although the wait was a bit long, the service from our server Scott topped it off! Very nice and friendly staff.
