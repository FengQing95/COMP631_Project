Kata Robata////I had been to Kata Robata once before for happy hour and found James Beard nominated chef Manabu Horichu's modern Japanese dishes to be fresh-tasting, aesthetically pleasing, and appropriately priced. My recent dinner reinforced this impression. Considering I often hear Kata mentioned in the same breath as Uchi, MF sushi, and Kuu as the city's premiere sushi destination, I wasn't entirely shocked when it topped the Houston Chronicle's newly released Top 100 list. The ambiance of the restaurant, which is nestled in a strip mall off Richmond ave, is contemporary but subdued. There will likely be a wait around peak hours, and there isn't too much real estate inside by the entrance or bar to stand.
