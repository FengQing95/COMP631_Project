Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is one of my favorite places to have breakfast as it does have a separate menu from the items on display.  The coffee here is also some of the best I've had in Houston, they use Stumptown beans.  Recently, we've really enjoyed the sausage breakfast sandwich and onion bialy.  The pastry case has different croissants and divine chocolate chip cookies, moving on to luscious seasonal cakes and custards.  The macarons are solid and a perfect little dessert to breakfast.  I always leave with a loaf of bread as there are no other artisanal bread bakers in Houston.  Must be the humidity.  You cannot get a baguette or ciabatta worth a damn anywhere else.
