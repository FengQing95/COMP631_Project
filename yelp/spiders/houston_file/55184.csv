Kata Robata////Came in, expected good sushi and was completely blown away. My boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves and go with the omakase. And oh my God we were in for a treat. We had the pleasure of being served by chef Taka who took us on a magical journey with one of the best quality fish I've had in Houston. At some parts I felt like I went to sushi heaven and came back, but I digress. This place serves amazing sushi and has beautiful decor to boot. Fantastic food and great setting? Count me in.
