Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Disappointing service. I was at the front of the line when they handed out the lunch menus (11:00 a.m. on a Friday, June 20th) so I was the first to order lunch ("Buffalo" turkey & bacon) plus a vanilla latte and a chocolate croissant. The croissant was handed to me straight away with a sign and number for my table for the rest to be delivered.
