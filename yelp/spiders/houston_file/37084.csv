Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time at Bosscat and and it did not disappoint. We were in Houston for the weekend and this was the best service we've had the whole time. Omar was very nice, super attentive, and provided all around awesome service. The manager, Jose, sat down and chatted with us for 10 minutes which made us feel like important customers. This place has a trendy/Club atmosphere with creative food options, great drinks, and cute decor. We got the fruity pebble French toast and the meatloaf hash - both were delicious. Looking forward to trying their other locations!
