The Pit Room////Today I had the 2 meat special and my son the Jalapeño sausage and cheese sandwich. Both us had corn however I had the homemade in house Jalapeño chips and he the Cole slaw . The corn was good as usual. We both enjoyed chomping down on the the very favorable and juicy corn on the cob pieces.
