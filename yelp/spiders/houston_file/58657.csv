Baby Barnaby's////Before I actually entered the building there is a post with a sheet of paper attached to a clip board. You simply sign it filled out the appropriate fields and a waiter will call the name that is listed for your party. Pretty straight forward. I was kinda confused on where to wait after I signed in. But quickly noticed there was a place to sit just outside of the patio eating area.
