Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So we think there must be a wizard or magician working in the back making the food- it can't be normal humans. My pork chop was so tender and mind-blowing that we are convinced its sorcery. It melted in my mouth. When I first saw that it was $26 on the menu, I was like "eeek that's a little pricey for pork" and I was hesitant but then I ate a bite and I immediately said "ok, I get it". Worth every penny.
