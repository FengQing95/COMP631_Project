Kata Robata////Came here for dinner with 4 of my friends and although the food was amazing the service was awful. It took about 15 minutes for each drink to come out and they forgot our rice after we asked for it twice. When it was time for our check there were several items missing from the check and as we were trying to split it the waiter told us he would do it even though we insisted we could handle it. After 3 checks and 30 min of waiting we were finally able to leave. For a place as well known as Kata Robata we were very disappointed with the service that we received.
