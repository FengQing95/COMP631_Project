Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is an absolute diamond in the ruff. I ate at Bosscat for a brunch date and was thoroughly satisfied with both the meal and the service at the bar. There were so many options to choose from the brunch menu. I was caught in between the Fruity Pebble French Toast (let's be real who doesn't love French Toast for breakfast ) and the Burger which was suggested by the friendly and attentive bartender. I went with the burger as I wasn't sure of the sweetness level of the French Toast (gotta stay somewhat healthy right? ). The burger was absolutely amazing, especially with the Comeback sauce that was served with it. Next time I might go with the Sticky Bun burger or the French Toast. They had a special of a carafe of your choice (we obviously are basic and went with the mimosas ‚Äç) which comes with a free meal. In my opinion this is a really good deal, our total bill was under $65. The atmosphere reminds me of a classier Dogwood with better tasting food. Parking is either valet or first come, first serve so I highly suggest getting an Uber. It was absolutely packed in there so the wait time was about 25 minutes (not really that bad but when you are hungry it feels a lot longer) unless you sit at the bar. This place is perfect for dates as well as for large groups. I suggest getting a reservation for Friday thru Sunday. Overall, I was blown away by the friendliness of the staff. I will be eating here again! See you there!
