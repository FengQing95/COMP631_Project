Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Modern layout and bright interior. The tables for 2 are small. The restaurant is packed even on a Monday brunch. Our wait was roughly 20 minutes. The hostess will take your phone number to put you on the waitlist. They'll give you a text once it's ready. So don't forget to pay attention to your phone. The parking lot was packed. We were lucky enough to find a parallel spot next to the street.
