Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat to the rescue! After we tried to go to another restaurant that offered reservations on Resy for MLK day but turned out to be closed, I called an audible and we headed for Bosscat. Bosscat has consistently good drinks and an excellent whisk(e)y list. Their food is also very good. Most importantly, they have outdoor seating and "indoor outdoor" seating, which basically means you are under or right next to one of the huge roll-up doors. They follow COVID-19 best practices to the T. I was comfortable eating by one of the doors, far from other tables, with masked servers and other precautions. I could tell they were committed to the safety of their customers and their staff.
