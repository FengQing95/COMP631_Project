JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tasty ramen, but... Â We came in on a semi-busy Sunday evening and the hostesses were really disorganized. First, there are two places for bar seating. One is first-come first-serve. The other isn't. So that's pretty confusing. Second, dozens of folks walked out, but somehow those tables didn't open up. Not worth the hassle.
