Uchi////It been more than 2 years since I came here. I had an awesome experience last time so I brought my boyfriend for his birthday dinner. I made reservation online a month before. And also on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowd. My reservation was at 7pm and I was stuck in traffic due to constructions on the road. Oh no! Panic set in. I called the restaurant to tell them I was running late. They told me I have a 15 minutes grace window. I have to be in the building by 7:15 or my table was not guaranteed. Oh my goodness I barely made it.
