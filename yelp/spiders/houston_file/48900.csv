Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Expect to wait an hour during peak times.. small restaurant with minimum seating for those waiting to be seated. Oh and parking is terrible ! I ran into Kevin Johnson (Houston Texans player) and apparently he is a regular here! Tons of yummy food on menu but I went with OMG French toast. It was delicious. Will return during a non weekend day :)
