Uchi////Unmemorable points: Tempura-fried brie..I think I ate this the first time but as I say, I guess it was unmemorable.  Tempura shrimp roll (biendo) was clean and not like classic tempura shrimp rolls but unmemorable.  Yellowtail roll (zero sen) was likewise clean and fresh but I must have missed any subtle creative touches here, too.  I'm not a dessert person so I'm blanking on the dessert both times..sorry.
