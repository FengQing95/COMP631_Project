JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Excellent facility and super friendly staff. My pet received exemplary care and Dr Choice was on the ball communicated well. However you pay for that and I found they were trying to upsell unnecessary products. Would I take my pet back for emergency care? Yes but I would balk on all the upselling. It's not necessary.
