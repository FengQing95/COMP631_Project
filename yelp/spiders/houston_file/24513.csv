Uchi////My first in person dining experience during the current pandemic was uchi and It was wonderful!! It was as good as I remembered. They did a great job social distancing and I never felt uncomfortable or that I was too close to other guests. The food was delicious as always. The brussel sprouts are a must try, words cannot describe how good these are. The uchi salad was a nice fresh, crispy and refreshing item to balance out the heavier sauced appetizers, the cashew pesto dipping sauce is so good! But to be honest I would probably skip this dish next time.. it was good but there are better items on the menu. Speaking of.. the bok choy is definitely one of the most underrated items on the menu, it is SO good and a must try! This is not your average bok choy, it's mixed with tomatoes and sauce and is so delicious, it has a creamy and crunchy texture. We also had the cauliflower with raisins and pine nuts, it was good but not amazing. My fiancé had unagi and wagu beef and enjoyed it. I got the kinoke nabe which was amazing...if you like mushrooms you will absolutely love this dish. It was so good my fiancé said he would get that instead of the beef next time. I also love that they are so vegan friendly and have so many plant based options. Overall the food was delicious and the service was 5 stars, can't wait to come back!
