Local Foods////Local Foods is a great place to check in for a casual meal. My favorite part is the outdoor patio because it's the perfect spot to hang out and eat on a good day. There are a lot of seating options inside if you aren't much of a picnic person though! The place can get busy and tables can become hard to find so I wouldn't recommend going with a large party.
