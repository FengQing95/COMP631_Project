Baby Barnaby's////Many friends have had bad experiences at Baby Barnaby's and I was the last one to continue to go to this establishment. Several friends, 4 to be exact, that are lactose intolerant have asked for soy milk and been given cow milk only to get wildly sick later because of the IRRESPONSIBLE staff. 2 of my friends actually told the waitress when they realized that they had been given regular milk and the waitress ARGUED with the patrons and said that they had asked for regular milk and not soy milk without apologizing for getting confused or apologizing for causing them to be very sick for an entire day. This is wildly irresponsible and arguments between a wait staff and a customer are never appropriate or necessary.
