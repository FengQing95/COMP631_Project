JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Miriam - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your experience at JINYA. For starters, did you ask your server to turn up the air conditioning? Since the warmer weather has set in, we don't get too many complaints about the temperature of our restaurant, but regardless of the size or nature of any complaint, we do our best to remedy them if it's within our power.
