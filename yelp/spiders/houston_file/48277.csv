Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Like this place is a godsend its sooooo good, and the "Snoozers" helps keep it lively, I forgot to ask their names but, im pretty sure that they will know who they are when they read this review, them made sure that i was comfortable and kinda homey i guess you can say, and the cooks did an A1 job, didn't miss a beat with my order. Recommending this to everyone who are breakfast lovers.
