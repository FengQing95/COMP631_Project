Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Bonus: Me and my companion both ordered something savory so our waitress brought us a free cinnamon roll pancake so we could try something sweet! Talk about wonderful customer service. The pancake was great, but very sweet. It was a nice finish to end our meal but I would not have wanted to order just it because of the enormous amount of sugar.
