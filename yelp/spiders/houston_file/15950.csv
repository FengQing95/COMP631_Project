JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is definitely my favorite spot to get ramen in Houston. It's probably the best ramen I've ever had. I always get the Spicy Chicken Ramen and it never disappoints. The ramen usually comes out very hot, which I like (I've been to a place where it was warm and I wasn't happy lol). I usually add Chicken Soboro (ground chicken) to my ramen and it gives it more flavor. The flavor of the chicken broth is great, and the level of spicy isn't unbearable (I usually like mine really spicy so I always add extra hot sauce). The chicken is always tender and succulent, and they give you a nice amount.
