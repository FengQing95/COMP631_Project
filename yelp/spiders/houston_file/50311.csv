Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered the custom omelet and the sweet potato hash. Both were good, I did find that the sweet potato dish was incredibly salty, and used extra bread from the omelet to cut the salt. We also ordered a dish to go, avocado toast. The server, who had about 6 customers to wait on (we were at the bar) did a subpar job of keeping water glasses full, checking in, and was overall pretty short with us. To the point I felt bad asking for anything. Obviously this is one person, and I'm sure there are great wait staff there, unfortunately I didn't have that experience.
