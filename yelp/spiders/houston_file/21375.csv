Uchi////As one of the reviewer, Long T. stated, I was the person who trusted my waitress opinions. I should have knew better not to trust her palate. So, when ordering I just knew what I wanted to order but when the waitress was telling me the great food it sounded like what I wanted to eat. She also mentioned that it was family style--- do not believe them. Â Most of the dishes were not family style-- more like individual. So, my advice for everyone is not to trust your waitress opinions because you could end up like us.
