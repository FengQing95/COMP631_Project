Kata Robata////Houston is a city famed for its food, and this restaurant is about as good as it gets. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by a clean, lively restaurant, mingled with the sights and smells of people's dishes. The atmosphere was casual, not stiff like many other gourmet restaurants, but it still also retains that air of sophistication one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The staff was friendly and helpful--making sure to check-up on us often, yet not be overbearing at the same time.
