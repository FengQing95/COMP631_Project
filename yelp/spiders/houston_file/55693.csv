Kata Robata////For nigiri and rolls we got the Sushi platter than came with 10 nigiri and tropical or non-tropical tuna roll. The 10 nigiri pieces were salmon, tuna, fatty tuna, snapper, yellowtail, amberjack, scallop, shrimp, fish roe and eel. All beautifully served which you can really tell they care about quality. This came with a tuna roll which was topped with avocado and black fish roe. We also grabbed a Rising Sun roll featuring yellowtail, avocado, peppercorn tuna, truffle vinaigrette. The Peppercorn tuna was the focal point of this roll. I just wish that the roll was evenly covered with the truffle vinaigrette because my bite didn't bring everything together since I didn't get any.
