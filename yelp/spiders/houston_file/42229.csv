Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Maybe I read too much hype, but I was a bit disappointed with Common Bond. The apricot almond scone was very crumb-y and cake-like in texture.  It had a great sugared and crisp exterior, but the inside was fluffy. The flavor was stellar, but a scone lives by its texture. I prefer mine heartier and more biscuit-like in texture.  The iced coffee was my favorite part of the experience. Rich, full bodied and not diluted when served over ice.
