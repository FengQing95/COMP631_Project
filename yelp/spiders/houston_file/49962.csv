Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Like I said, you'll be waiting a while for the food to come out so I wouldn't recommend this place who needs to be out in a jiffy or who's looking for a quick breakfast. But when you're seated and all the while you're waiting, the waitress comes every now and then to apologize for the wait and that she just checked and it'll be out shortly. I don't know if she really went and checked and all but it's the thought that counts :)
