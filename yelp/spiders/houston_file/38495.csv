Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Definitely not vegetarian friendly unless you're ok with just having a salad and maybe a side. I ordered the pimento cheese. It came to the table with what one would consider crackers or flattened stale bread. At no point would I ever call what I received toasted or close to being bread-like. The vegetables that accompanied this plate consisted of tomatoes and cucumber slices.  When asked if they could possibly add some other vegetable to this 11 dollar side, the chef would not accommodate.  I find it hard to believe that the only "vegetables" in your kitchen are those which are mentioned above. The pimento cheese dip itself was just ok.
