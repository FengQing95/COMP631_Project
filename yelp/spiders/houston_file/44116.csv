Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been to Common Bond numerous times and have been wowed by their food, but recently had a negative experience and was really bummed. Â I reached out to them and let them know the situation and they were more than eager to not only right their wrong with a refund but invited me to dine for a meal on the house.
