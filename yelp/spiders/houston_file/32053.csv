Local Foods////I mainly come here for the people watching, but the food selection is great. Always fresh salads and sandwiches, with wonderfully imaginative combinations and great lemonade. And if what's on offer doesn't strike for fancy, ask if they have something that does. They've always been real accommodating with my random requests. Quirky, slightly too try-hard d√©cor, but it fits with the area and the clientele (again, my favourite part of every visit; such pretty pretty people frequent this place!)
