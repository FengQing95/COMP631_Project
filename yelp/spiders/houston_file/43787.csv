Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I tried the chocolate cake, which was solid, but nothing amazing (not what I expected from the hype over this place). The combination of sea salt to chocolate was interesting, the mousse and cream were rich but not too sweet, and the crunchy base was a good texture contrast. I couldn't finish the whole cake (even though it was only a 2 in square) because of how rich it was, so if you get it make sure you have a friend to share with! 4/5
