Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I scheduled a team dinner here because of all the reviews I read and because the menu looked good.  I made reservations, though I didn't need them (5PM on a Tuesday) for the three of us.  Service was slow.  Drinks were good.  I had the Kentucky Orange Blossom (x2).  Food was excellent.  We had the poutine, the pig candy, the pimento cheese, and the pickles.  All were very good but filling so we didn't end up eating dinner.
