JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////RAMEN: I have tried plenty of places when eating ramen. I always order spicy miso and I have to say this place was my absolute favorite. The broth wasn't too salty and it just felt so soothing. It was amazingly delicious. The ramen noodles were my favorite. They were thick noodles that were the perfect consistency. I also love how the meats were in small chucks! It's just a preference because I don't like biting into things but I rather have them bite size.
