JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA ramen is AMAZING! You MUST get the spicy shrimp tempura tapa, and also the tayokabi (sp? is definitely off), but everything there is so great. I got the HOT Ramen, and it was true to its word! Delicious. Also, the gyoza was incredible too if you like potstickers. Definitely recommend - its great for its prices too. I'll have to try it on happy hour soon!
