Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I called ahead to see if there was a wait and the hostess was super confused and kept trying to make me do a reservation instead of answering the question. Finally I just hung up and still went to check them out. There was no wait at all, we were immediately seated. Our waitress was very friendly but kept disappearing. We ordered the an appetizer, it took a few minutes to come out but was not brought by our waitress, which is fine but we did not see her again until 10 minutes after we already ate the appetizer. Â It would have been nice to place our dinner order sooner. The food was over all good, just seemed a little pricey, and the noise level was way too loud. The music is over powering and was very hard to hear my husband who was directly in front of me.
