Kata Robata////Best ramen in Houston. Great service and surprisingly family friendly! The lobster Mac and cheese is a pleaser. Super rich and creamy. Chicken yakatori was very good. The duck confit ramen was very good. It's in a clear broth so it's very light. Comes with six big duck filled wonderful dumplings and the amount of noodles is great.
