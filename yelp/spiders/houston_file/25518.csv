Uchi////The best food experience I've ever had. It was so great, the food, the staff, it's a full experience. Our waiter and server were top notch and very attentive. We tried multiple sake's until we found one we liked. And then we basically did a run through the entire menu. Almost everything was amazing and if it wasn't they took it off our tab. When in Houston Uchi is a must!
