Local Foods////i've sampled a variety of the sandwiches here and my favorite is the truffled egg salad-where has this sandwich been all my life?!? the pairing of truffles with egg salad is superb, and the pretzel bun adds the perfect amount of saltiness to the equation.  the house smoked salmon is good, but it's a tad bit heavy with the cream cheese.  they used to have a duck sandwich with cranberry jam that tasted like Thanksgiving... hopefully they'll bring that back to the menu. the sides are all good, but my favorite is definitely the kale salad.
