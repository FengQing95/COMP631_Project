Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hardly willing to wait in a line for anything so when a "winter storm" came through & Snooze was still open, I took the opportunity to come in. Snooze definitely deserves all the "hype" it get and I may just be convinced to wait in line in the future! Went with the regular eggs benedict & it was great. Staff is so sweet as well!
