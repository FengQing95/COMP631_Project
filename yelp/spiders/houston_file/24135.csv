Uchi////This is the third time I've been to Uchi and the experience has been consistently great. We came on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar. Our bartender was Stephen, and it is employees like him who make this restaurant so successful. He was very attentive, recommended great items to try, and had an affable personality that made us feel like we were chatting with a buddy.
