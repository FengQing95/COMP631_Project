Baby Barnaby's////One of the best waffles ever. Crispy and soft plus the sweetness from the fruits....makes the perfect combo bite. It would have been a five stars except the pancakes I ordered on my second visit was a bit dry. Â Will be trying french toast next time. Friendly service. The place is really cute. Street parking, but haven't had problems finding a spot.
