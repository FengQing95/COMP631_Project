Uchi////Uchi....Uchi...Uchi! So many different people had mentioned this place lately that I just had to check it out. My galpal & I headed over about 7:00pm last night (Saturday) with no reservations. I had tried to make reservations the day before online and by calling but none were available. Now seeing the place I understand as it is a pretty small spot but totes worth it!
