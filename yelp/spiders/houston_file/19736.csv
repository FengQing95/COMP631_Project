Uchi////Definitely the best sushi I've ever had.  We had about 10 items and they were all spectacular.  The sauces that go with each dish are equally amazing.  Our friendly sushi bar neighbors ordered us some of their favorite Uchi delights we had missed during our dinner and also gave us a peanut butter dessert.  A night and meal to remember for sure!!
