JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The wait is quite a great times. I keep coming back for a reason though! The food is tasty, portions are on the smaller fancy side. They're so packed and busy that the food is usually rushed. My edamame had noodles in it and i was told they cooked it with the noodles in the same soup... oh well. The wait is worth it if it's at night and you're in that area and really don't wanna drive further! Not very comfortable unless you can snag a booth, sometimes you'll be required to sit alongside strangers, but across from your party... oh well, private conversations are kinda impossible lol. But go!.... for the experience :)
