The Pit Room////Decided to grab some Texas BBQ while family was in town. The Pit Room seemed to be highly recommended so we checked this place out. There is a parking lot with plenty of spaces. We were immediately greeted upon arriving. We got the brisket, two tacos, mac n cheese and coleslaw. The brisket melted in my mouth and was my favorite. The tacos were not bad but I'd suggest to skip them and grab meat instead. Sides were good!
