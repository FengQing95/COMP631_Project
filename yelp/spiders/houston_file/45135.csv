Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Manfriend loved the "sriracha BBQ pork" & cole slaw served between brioche (12$). I didn't taste the sriracha in the BBQ at all. It was actually more tarty than smoky to me. & the cole slaw was meh. It was purple cabbage & not very crunchy (which would've added texture).
