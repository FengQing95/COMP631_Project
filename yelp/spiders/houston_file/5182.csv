JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We had takoyaki which was veryy good. Slightly crunchy on the outside, mushy inside, and there were quite a lot of chewy octopus pieces inside which was really good. The batter and the sauce was just the perfect amount too. I also got the pork chashu bowl (egg, rice and chashu), which I thought was really good. Nothing fancy but tasted much like a home cooked meal :) The chashu in the rice was great.
