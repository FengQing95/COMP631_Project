Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So the two times I've gone, I've ordered an alcoholic beverage. The first time I ordered a pomegranate margarita which was really tasty! The second time, I got the pineapple mimosa. I don't think I'm a fan of champagne (shocker, I know!) but it wasn't to my liking. My husband ordered the Hill Mountain Mule and that was better than I expected.
