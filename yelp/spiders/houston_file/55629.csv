Kata Robata////Yuzu Salmon Carpaccio($8):  This one is just amazing mixture of flavor.  Thinly sliced salmon pieces are laid out and there are crunchy fish, arugula, dried citrus (maybe kumquat?) and what is that white sauce!?  It is soooo good.  Try to put all of them on a salmon slice and fold it into 3.  It will become just a bite size.
