JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////NOT COVID FRIENDLY AT ALLLL!!! NO SOCIAL DISTANCING WHAT SO EVER AND RUDE MANAGER. One of my friends brought food from another restaurant there and was eating. Manger told HER to put it away or leave in front of everyone. Even though she watched us walk in with it. Not sure why it was an issue if we were eating there. Had I known that one of my friends would have been embarrassed In front of other customers I would have not came at all. #disappointed
