Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wow was this place great. Let's start with the food. I had the Bosscat Press and asked to not have any bread (gluten free) and they brought it out in a mini skillet. It was HUGE! I thought they packed it because they felt bad I couldn't have bread but our server, Paul, explained that they never let you leave hungry. Food was super delicious but I just couldn't finish. We also had the Parmesan Crusted Meatloaf. I wasn't a huge fan of the jam but the Meatloaf was very yummy. We also ordered the fries. These fries are probably now on my top 3 list of all time best fries. They were super crispy!! Now here is the secret... Use the comeback sauce as the dipping sauce. That's a total win. Okay moving on to service. Paul was the bees knees. Very nice, informative, and funny. The rest of the staff was super nice and attentive as well. Not like meh attentive, I mean, you walk away and they fold your napkin attentive. As for drinks, they have 300 different types of whiskeys so you know they are legit. If you aren't a whiskey drinker, they have a bunch of other drinks to choose from. Overall, definitely worth checking it out.
