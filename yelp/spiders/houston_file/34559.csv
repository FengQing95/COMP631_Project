Local Foods////SO GOOD. We were looking for a light, healthier, but filling option for lunch and we found it here. We got the egg salad sandwich and smoke salmon bagel sandwich. They were both divine! I love that they include two side dishes with your meal; all of the sides we got were delicious. The fresh lemonade was also amazing. Overall, the meal was not only flavorful and fresh but also a great value, and we will definitely return if in the area!
