Local Foods////I really like this place! I try to eat vegetarian as often as possible, and while this place doesn't have too many veggie options, the ones they do offer hit the spot and are hard to beat. I had an avocado soup that was to die for, but I suppose it is seasonal because I don't see it on their current menu. But I could eat their market veggie sandwich every day...I love sandwiches and it's hard to find a great veggie sandwich without missing meat, but they make it happen. The sides are pretty good, I love their potato salad and the house made chips are excellent, but the local fruit I got was just an orange. Tasty, but I'd like to see them offer a variety. The mintade is really good too. I will say that seating here can be a problem, even with just two people.
