Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came in for a Happy Hour celebration, which I had particularly selected for their Whiskey selection, so my friend would be happy. She can't seem to find her brand in many locations. WELL that event quickly came to a halt in the first 20 minutes by a condescending bartender. His remarks (which he thought were cute & charming did not come across as such. Bryce (with a "Y") needs better bar talking skills.
