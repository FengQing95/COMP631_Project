Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////While we were waiting to be seated we were chatting with the host and said we had never eaten there before. We were seated quickly. To our surprise, the host came over with a complementary blueberry cream cheese stuffed pancake. Delicious. We both ordered the huevos rancheros. They were good, but could have been spicier. All in all, a nice place with nice people with good food and good service and you don't have to get up early.
