Uchi////As for the food, we were very impressed. I don't believe you will find fresher sushi anywhere in Houston. Everything we ate was flown in from Japan that day. Their dishes are very creative and were all excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone who's a fan of sushi. The place is pricey, but when you taste the food you'll know where that extra money went.
