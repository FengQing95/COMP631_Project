Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast and brunch place if you're looking for some quality breakfast food in the Montrose area. However, they close at 2:30 so make sure to arrive early. I had to wait for a seat at the bar (open seating) but sometimes the wait is over an hour for one person. However, it'll be worth it once you sit down.
