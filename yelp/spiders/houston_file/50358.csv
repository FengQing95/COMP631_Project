Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been trying to get into Snooze for a while but their long wait times kept me away. Be prepared, it is a very popular brunch spot but you might have to wait a while for seating. We were told the wait would be 60 to 90 minutes but we were able to be seated closer to the hour mark. They had a good variety of options on their menu but what I liked most was that you could pretty much piece together the perfect brunch. I took a little longer than I liked for the food to come out but that was understandable as they were busy. I had the Snooze Classic but added a blueberry pancake. Everything came out well and I enjoyed the meal. Everything was also pretty reasonably priced.
