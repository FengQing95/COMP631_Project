Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry was our waiter and he was fabulous! He was very knowledgeable about the food and went through each section of the menu and recommended items and explained why. He was even kind enough at the end to only bring out my 1 churro instead of all of them as I requested so I wouldn't devour them all in one setting!
