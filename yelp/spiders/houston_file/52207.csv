Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Spuds Deluxe with bacon and onions with the over easy egg. It was delicious. The bacon chunks were huge, and the onions were saut√©ed to the point where it wasn't the sharp bitter onion-y taste. The cheese was such a great pair to the potatoes as well. I would totally recommend going here if you have the time or even Door Dashing if you don't!
