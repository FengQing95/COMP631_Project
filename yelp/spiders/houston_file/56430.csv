Kata Robata////I'd heard about this place for years and finally went at the spur of a moment. Everything was great but the Miso Marinated Black Cod and the Longhorn Roll were phenomenal.  Also, something else I like is that they serve high quality soda made with real cane sugar.  I got their version of Coke and it was really good.
