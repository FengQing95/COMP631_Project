Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is definitely one of the better chic restaurant bars which I have been to in Houston. The atmosphere is great with the candlelights on the table (real one's, not just electric one's like many restaurants these days), the open windows letting the breeze throughout the restaurant, etc. The restaurant also maintained a slightly below average noise volume - I could hear my date across the table :)
