Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was crazy busy today. There was a two hour wait (to be expected since it just opened) so we got our food to go. The staff was super friendly for how busy it was. The food was ok, not super fabulous but not bad. Glad we did not wait the two hours I would have been sad. I'll give this place another try once it has been open for awhile.
