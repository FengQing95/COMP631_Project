Baby Barnaby's////OMG their green eggs!! My bf ordered them, and I loved them so much, he apparently scooped like 3/4ths of it on my plate. I ate everything he gave me. I kept saying how do you make eggs this good?!?! I don't understand. It looks like its just eggs, but they are amazinggggg. Best eggs I've had in my life. I got the High protein burrito. the green eggs were way better. Do yourself a favor and just get the green eggs. The orange juice was really fresh, too.
