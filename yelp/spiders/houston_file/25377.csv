Uchi////Angela also suggested we tried the fried milk. It's not something I would normally gravitate towards but I had read reviews of it in previously and took the plunge. My partner and I were instantly in love. The outside crust was fried to perfection and all the textures and flavor of the dessert was perfectly balanced and not too sweet. I could have had two or three more servings of this because it was so good.
