Uchi////Solid food and service every time I come whether it be for dinner or for happy hour. My favs are the foie nigiri, gyutoro and hirame usuzukuri. The foie gras is uber rich, gyutoro melts in your mouth, and the founder sashimi has a great balance of taste and texture. The ham and eggs roll and bacon tataki are good pork belly options. Can't go wrong with the walu walu, machi cure, hama chili and fried milk dessert. Skip the zero sen roll and lemon gelato. The gelato comes with a white beet pur√©e that overpowers the whole dish. More savory than sweet.
