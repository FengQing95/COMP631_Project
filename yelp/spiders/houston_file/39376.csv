Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What a fabulous addition to the River Oaks area! Special thanks to Layton for inviting us! The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I had the Bosscat burger. One of the best burgers I've had in Houston! The buns are even homemade and melt in your mouth. They use very high-quality beef. The homemade fries were delicious too. My friends loved their food. Layton took great care of us at the bar. He is the best mixologist in Houston and I always love trying his concoctions. He even surprised us with the red velvet churros for dessert. Yum! One of the managers showed us the unique whiskey room, as well. Very beautiful decor!
