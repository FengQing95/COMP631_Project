Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Excellent place with lots of balance- food is higher end comfort food and very delicious indeed. Ambiance is just upscale enough while not being too stuffy. Service is great. Excellent whiskey centered cocktail menu. If the weather is nice, the patio is great. Location good too, albeit parking is a little tight without valet. This should be a solid go-to place!
