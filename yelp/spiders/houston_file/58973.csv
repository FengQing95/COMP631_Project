Baby Barnaby's////Definitely lives up to the yelp hype! Green eggs with biscuits, french toast and freshly squeezed OJ were all amazing and served incredibly fast. Staff does their thing with a huge smile on their face. I'm only in Houston for a few days but I'm going to try to come back. Great job Baby Barnaby's!
