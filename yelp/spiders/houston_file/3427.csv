JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the jinya bun. It was okay. Maybe I feel this way because I've had ippudo's pork bun... Oh baby. Oh baby oh baby oh baby. Anyway, this jinya bun was interesting. It had mayo? Maybe too much on mine. Meat was cooked nice but I think they drizzle hoisin sauce? Too sweet.
