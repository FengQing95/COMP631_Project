Kata Robata////I love this sushi place! My friends and I used to do our girls night out here a lot. We used to meet for happy hour and Â it eventually became one of my favorite sushi places. I am not going to lie and say that I have ever eaten here outside of the happy hour window (mainly because I am too cheap) but I do love the happy hour! :)
