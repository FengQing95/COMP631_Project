Uchi////Their DRINKS are, for the most part, Japanese-based, and the two cocktails I got were delicious.  The Yuki Hyo should be synonymous with "Sake-Sour," and the Beri Cha is like a Japanese version of a mimosa.  They also serve sake straight, and it comes in a glass inside a cute little wooden box. Two thumbs up on drinks all around at my table.
