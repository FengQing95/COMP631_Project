The Pit Room////This was my first time eating Texas bbq and it was so good. I got the two meat dinner with brisket and jalapeño cheddar sausage and Mac and cheese and okra as my sides. The brisket was delicious. The jalapeño cheddar sausage was also great but pretty spicy. The Mac and cheese was much better than I expected. You get a lot of food, I barely ate half of it and had to take the rest home. Also the staff was so nice! They were helpful when I was deciding what to order and also came over to my table and packed up my leftovers for me. I came around 5 on a Friday and there was no line and no problem finding seats.
