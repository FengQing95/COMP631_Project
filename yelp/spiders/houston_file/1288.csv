JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Freaking amazing!!!! We went with a big group and they were great about separating everyone's tabs out. Everyone loved the ramen and the service was fabulous. I had the white miso and my hubby had the spicy chicken one. They were both great. Load on that fresh garlic and I was one happy girl.
