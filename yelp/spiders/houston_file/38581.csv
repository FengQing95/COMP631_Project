Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////What got me to consider it was their yelp page showing they had fruity pebble french toast. And it's as glorious as it sounds. I loved the fresh fruit that was sprinkled around it and it was overwhelmingly sweet. I would go back specifically for it. Something very small but they didn't charge me for the two glasses of coffee I drank. And as a huge coffee lover I totally appreciated that.
