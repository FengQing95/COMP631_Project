Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Not sure who gives this place anything less than a 5 star rating. Â I have been to this place twice, once for a late dinner and a Sunday brunch, both times my experience was nothing less than amazing. Everybody here is so friendly and stops at your table to ask if everything is going alright and in a genuine way not just "I was passing by so I'll pretend to be interested" way. The first time I sampled the chilaquiles and pork belly tacos , both were delicious. For dinner we did the Houston Food Week menu which does not disappoint, it is a three-course meal with 3 options in each course, appetizers, main entree, and dessert. They have a unique menu that will make you return to get a taste for more.
