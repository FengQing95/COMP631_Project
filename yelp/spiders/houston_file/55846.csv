Kata Robata////My original intention for coming here was to try their ramen. I was on a ramen kick that week (tried ramen bar uchi and agu ramen), but my bf and I ended up ordering sushi and it did not disappoint! I'm not a big fan of sushi but their sushi, I LOVE!! Everything was fresh, had the perfect filling to rice ratio, and was flavorful enough that I didn't require any soy sauce for dipping. It was perfect!
