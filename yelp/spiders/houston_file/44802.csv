Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came to Common Bond for Saturday brunch. There was a line to get in so it was not fun standing in the outdoor heat during hot season. Â The place is clean and modern. Food is good. Pastry is yummy. Croissants are the bomb, very light and flaky with variety of flavors. It is a little pricey but you pay for beautiful boxing, location and experience.
