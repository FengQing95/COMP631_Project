The Pit Room////I have given the pit room three tries and every time have been highly disappointed, I know that people like their barbecue, I asked one specific question when I went in and that was can I get a wet cut or a fatty piece of beef something juicy to which they said of course and when I got my meal it was dry and tough every time. I will not say that it's bad because there was absolutely nothing wrong with the quality of what they were serving I just did not like the temperature and the lack of moisture,The one thing that I will say is I will not be going back for those reasons Houston has way too many barbecue restaurants to go someplace that you don't resonate with and I wish them continued success
