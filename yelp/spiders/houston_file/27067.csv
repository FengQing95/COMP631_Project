The Pit Room////My wife and I came here on our trip to Houston and this is some of the BBQ that we have ever had. I had the three meat combo with  brisket, ribs, and chicken with a side of macaroni and cheese and green beans. She had the one meat combo with brisket and potato salad and macaroni and cheese. The food was awesome and the portion size where big. I especially liked the green beans. Also even though the restaurant was more cafeteria style, the service was  still very good and the people were very friendly.
