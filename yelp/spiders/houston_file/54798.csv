Kata Robata////Although Kata focuses primarily on modern Japanese fusion cuisine, its menu also features many conventional Japanese entrees and sushi including the omakase option, a rare serving style popularized by Jiro Dreams of Sushi in which the chef decides the sushi choices based on the day's fish selection and the chef's skill. However, Kata Robata's most popular entree is the lobster mac and cheese ($19), which has won many accolades like the best mac and cheese from the Houston Press. The signature entree's main ingredients are simply macaroni pasta, cheddar cheese sauce, and lobster chunks, and their quality is what made this innocent-looking entree extraordinary. In this unlikely pairing of the common mac and cheese and the fancy lobster meat, the creamy cheddar sauce sets a flavorful overtone that plays harmoniously with the taste of the baked lobster chunks. The soft macaroni pasta and the firm lobster meat also perform a surprising contrast in this duet of texture. The lobster mac and cheese is an interestingly overlapping but wonderful experience in both taste and texture.
