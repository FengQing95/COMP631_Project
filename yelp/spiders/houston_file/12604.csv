JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here a couple times but the food is always a disappointment, as well as their service. The servers are unhelpful and are unattentive. I was being seated when the server who was bringing me in knocked over another servers tray of water and it spilled everywhere. Without a word, she just stopped and cleaning it up and didn't say a word to me so I just stood there and waited. As she finished, another couple walked in and she told them to follow her to the table. Umm ok? As for my server who was taking my order, I was asking him what the difference the cha cha ramen was to the other (I forgot which one I was trying to compare it to) but he replied "it has more garlic" ok obviously it does because of the name but I asked what broth they used and he said he didn't know and couldn't even tell me that. The ramen here is just average and I really don't see anything that stand out. I've had the cha cha cha- garlic ramen, jinya black tonkotsu and regular tonkotsu ramen and neither were good. Not pleased and will not return
