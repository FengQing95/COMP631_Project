Baby Barnaby's////We were really surprised by the average food given all the great reviews.  We got the Bob's Plate, green eggs, and burrito and there was nothing particularly good.  Even the orange juice wasn't great.  Maybe it was just an off day.  Service was good but I wouldn't ever wait in line for this place.
