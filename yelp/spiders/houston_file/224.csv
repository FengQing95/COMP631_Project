JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya jinya, I've lost count the amount of time I've been here since they opened a little over a year ago. I guess it helps that I live right across the street from them lol. Love the bun, always order it every time I come. Very tender meat, only wish it was bigger because it's gone after two bites haha. Really the foods alway consistent and their staff are amazing. Susan, Daniel, and Salon are always fun and on point. Do yourself a favor and try it if you haven't already :)
