JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Woohoo more ramen in Houston! We came here on a Saturday night around 6:30 and we had to wait 30-40 minutes to get a table for 2. It was weird though, because when we walked in, the place was half empty (...what...) and there were still a ton of people (mostly Asians) waiting outside.
