Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you're a breakfast/brunch person - which I most certainly am - you'll hit the jackpot at Snooze. The menu offers a plethora of sweet or savory options: migas, a variety of eggs bennie, vegan friendly options, gluten-free options, and most importantly, dee-licious pancakes that you can create into a flight! And don't forget their cocktail menu.
