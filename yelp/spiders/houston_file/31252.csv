Local Foods////Wow. When someone told me Benjy's opened a sandwich shop, I scoffed. But I completely take that back. Local Foods is wonderful and deserving of the long lines and hype. My truffled egg sandwich was on a perfectly baked pretzel bun. The fact that they know what Old Bay is warmed my heart for what I miss about D.C. Â My husband had the duck confit with the side of kale, which he reported were excellent. The food is fresh and creative. I wish they'd figure out a way to add more seats, but until then, I'll settle for eating a weirdly early lunch.
