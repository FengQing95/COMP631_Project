Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We LOVE Snooze. Their food is as good as breakfast gets. Freshly made and multiple in-season options. Their coffee products are always delicious. The cinnamon roll pancake is like God's gift to me- it's one of my favorite breakfast items of all time. We always get their "choose 2" of the eggs benedict. The chilaquiles one is fab. When you go, be prepared to walk a few blocks or drive around looking for parking, and be prepared to wait. At least they have a texting service to notify you when your table is ready so you don't have to hang around too closely.
