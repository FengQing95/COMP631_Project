Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pretty good. The menu looks rock star, but the food was average. The drinks were average. The service was good. The prices were a little high for what we got in my opinion. That being said - my girlfriends and I had a good dining experience nonetheless and would probably go back every now and again.
