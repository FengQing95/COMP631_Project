Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My 3 year old and I came for an early treat after taking my husband to the airport. Unfortunately my toddler decided to have a complete meltdown in the restaurant which is always a little embarrassing but also very rare for him. Anyway the staff was so accommodating, I felt like I was being treated like royalty. They brought my kid toys and talked to him, brought us an extra pancake, and the bartender even asked him for a big hug when we left. While some places are intolerant of bratty children, the staff this morning couldn't have been more patient and hospitable. On top of all that the food was really delicious - I had the makin it grain bowl and my kid had the chocolate chip pancake. We will come again!
