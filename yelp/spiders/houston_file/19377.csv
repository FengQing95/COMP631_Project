Uchi////I don't write reviews often but I'm prompted to do so because of some of the negative comments posted. Some of these cheap, bitter women complaining about first dates and proper service have nothing to do with this great establishment. Each dish complex, really quality fish from great purveyors. Those listen to the negative reviews should hit a strip mall sushi joint to get their pleasures. This place is the real deal.
