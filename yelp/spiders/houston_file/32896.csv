Local Foods////Local Foods has a great vibe and a fair amount of parking considering it's basically in Rice Village. With creative drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and an extensive menu, it's definitely a foodie dream. Lots of healthy options here if that's your thing. For some reason, I usually find myself not really liking the food here...the pickles are weirdly sweet and the fruit salad is a tiny portion but a lot of people really do love it.
