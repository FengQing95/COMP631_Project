Local Foods////Took my grandmother there the other day and while parking is a challenge the food was worth it. I had the pretzel chicken sandwich that was good but I really enjoyed the sides. The kale salad was great, I would of eaten a big portion of just that. My grandma's lemongrass soup was a hit with her. Can't wait it try more of the menu.
