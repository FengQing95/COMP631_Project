Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Was so excited to try this place after seeing it everywhere! Parking is definitely limited on the curbside but there's a garage down the street! As we were approaching the entrance, we were immediately greeted and seated by the lovely host. I didn't expect the space to be so spacious! Social distancing is definitely not an issue when it comes to this restaurant. Our server was very kind and gave us all the answers to our questions! We ordered an appetizer which was the chicken and cheese dip, and it was SO incredibly good! I do recommend to share that appetizer as the portion was HUGE! All my friends ordered 3 sides and 3 dishes in total, and it literally could've fed 5-6 people... the portions were HUGE. I got the boss at burger and honestly, it's just a basic burger but BIG. I was just over with it after 2 bites... nothing special. But the FRIES however, were fries that I've never had before! They were covered in pepper and salt and was such a nice texture. I highly recommend the fries!
