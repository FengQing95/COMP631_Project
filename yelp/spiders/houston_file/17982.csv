Uchi////Honestly, I know next to nothing about sushi and defintly enjoyed my time here. Went on a friday ended up waiting for a bit, but no worries they feed you samples while waiting. Had many different types but clearly my least favorite was their "pitchfork" it was nice but not for me. Of actual roles I enjoyed the "sun '...." it was nice and clean tasting. Some sort of pork belly was outstanding which come in 4 chunks. With the brusselsprot my favorite, Â I would defintly return.
