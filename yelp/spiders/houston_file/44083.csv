Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////At first I didn't know what to order, but I was told that the almond croissant is a must have at this place. I ordered a giant almond croissant and a chai tea latte, and I immediately found a table. There were a lot of people for a Tuesday morning, but it's not hard to find a seat at around 9 am. I started munching on the croissant, and my chai came really soon afterwards.
