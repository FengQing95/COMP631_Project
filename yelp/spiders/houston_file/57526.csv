Kata Robata////One of the defining and quintessential dining experiencing in Houston. By far one of my favorite date spots in Houston, they offer a quaint experience with a varied menu and wide array of options. Their sushi is the phenomenal, and their own creations are wonderful as well. What makes kata stand out above the rest are its other untraditional offerings, the bone marrow, lobster mac, kobe beef skewers etc are unbelievable. Yes it does cost a pretty penny, but its a penny well spent. I will continue to go to kata for my Japanese fix.
