JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went here with my BFF and my boyfriend after Escape the Room recently over the weekend.  It was a great experience overall.  I would go again.  The highlights: gyoza; lychee cosmos; and the waiter helped me customize a noodle bowl so that I didn't have to have soup but could have the same ingredients as what was in one of the soups.  The service was great when we went, and the staff all greeted everyone enthusiastically.  The noodles seem to be very fresh and they were delicious.  This is not your 5 for $1 ramen, that's for sure.  However, with quality, you often have to pay.  The price was fairly dear consider this is a soup joint, but in my mind, it was worth it.
