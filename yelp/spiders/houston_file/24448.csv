Uchi////Also when we first ordered, our waiter asked us if we had any special requests. I was up for anything but since he asked, we said unagi/eel. I didn't think of it till later but we were never served any eel! What's the point of asking and you really couldn't fit it in in 10 courses!!! Also when we asked for more information about the omakase he literally said "a little bit of this and that." thank super helpful. I guess that was the first red flag.
