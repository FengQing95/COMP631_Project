Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I don't write many Yelp reviews.  But I am writing a review about Common Bond.  I don't stand in line for more than 10 minutes at food places.  But I stood in line for 45 minutes at Common Bond yesterday morning.  I don't spend over $3.00 for a croissant.  But I did at Common Bond.  I don't usually rave about other people's products.  But I am doing that for Common Bond.  Why?  My wife and I brought home a selection of about 12 different pastries, breads and cookies from Common Bond yesterday morning.  We (and our two sons who were at home) devoured all of it.  Magnificent flavors, textures, mouth feel... it was all there.  Would I spend that much money, write another review and wait in line as long a second time at Common Bond?   Yes, please.
