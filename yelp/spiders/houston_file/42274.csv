Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First, a little ditty about the name. My fiancee and I had been wanting to try it for a while but just made it in today. He had forgotten the name. I kept having to tell him. This happened three or four times. I guess it's a little forgettable. But then a weird and wonderful thing happened - right after we finished our food, a guy seated a few chairs down the "common table" from us engaged us in a random and pleasant conversation about the food. People from common areas talking about local food? That, ladies and gents, is what culture is all about, and it's a great thing for this ever-burgeoning neighborhood. When I pointed out to my dude that what had just happened was like the name of the restaurant, he again looked vacant. "Common Bond," I had to remind him. Then he got it. What a cool experience, and overall the place FEELS very social and informal. Like having lunch at a cool aunt's house with friends of friends.
