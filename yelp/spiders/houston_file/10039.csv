JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the spicy chicken ramen (hot) with fresh garlic (you need to crack the garlic yourself with this weird contraption they give you) and the broth was really tasty! The chicken was a bit too salty. I don't know if I would say it's the best, but it's definitely something I would get again.
