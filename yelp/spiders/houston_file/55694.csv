Kata Robata////For dessert we shared the Banana Crème Brule with nutella cream, and fresh blueberries, strawberries and bananas. I enjoy the flavor of banana and this had a true banana flavor and not the fake laffy taffy kind of banana flavor. The toppings gave it a nice balance because the berries brought a tartness that help cut the creaminess of the Crème Brule while the nutella provided a nice hazelnut pairing with the banana flavor. I felt the fresh bananas were a little of an overkill. They were covered with syrup which helped their cause. The second and my favorite dessert was the Green Tea Soufflé Cheesecake with red bean ice cream, chestnut cream, kuromame (black soy bean). This dish favors the traditional Asian palate in terms of it's flavors and sweetness level. This was a very mildly sweet dessert, mostly coming from the red bean ice cream. The dessert wasn't very much of a Soufflé Cheesecake at all, it was more of just a matcha angel food cake because it was a super fluffy and airy cake. This was not very sweet and had a bitter matcha green tea after taste, which it should. My favorite flavor from this plate was actually the black sesame that is served beside the red bean ice cream, this wasn't listed on the menu but was a nice addition. The kuromame was weird because it felt like I was eating black beans with the dessert.
