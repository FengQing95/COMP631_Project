JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was looking forward to some good ramen in houston but I wasn't that impressed. I had ordered the tonkotsu ramen and jinya bun. The bun was ok nothing to rave about and the ramen didn't have much flavor to it. I usually love ramen but I didn't even finish my bowl. I'm not sure what they put in the broth but after I left I was really thirsty despite drinking 2 glasses of iced tea at the restaurant.
