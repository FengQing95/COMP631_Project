Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So happy they decided to put one of these in Houston. I've always enjoyed going when in Denver and the experience is just as great. The variety on this menu makes it so hard to choose but If you're a first timer you have to get a pancake or go all out and try the trio as either a meal or a side and spilt it. Â I haven't been to this location yet on the weekend but I can assume the wait is just as crazy as the Denver locations so plan accordingly if you come on the weekends.
