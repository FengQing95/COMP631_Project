JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wasn't good ramen. The paste they used to spice it up completely took over any base flavor which may have existed. They should go with oil than paste. Also, the charshu was seasoned to bring out the pork flavor. The Houston crowd may not not have matured to the right flavor a pork ramen.
