Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been several times and it always the best breakfast!   Two of us shared the waffle of the day, which was a a chocolate chip waffle, with cream cheese and chocolate chips, along with our breakfast - amazing.  Staff and service was on top of everything - refilling coffee at ever turn and making sure we everything we needed.  Then they let us enjoy our food coma and conversation without  being pushy about paying the bill to get us out.
