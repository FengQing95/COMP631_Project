Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our second time trying to come here--we made the mistake of trying to drive last time we were in town, couldn't find parking. So we Ubered this time, and I am So Glad We did!! Place is crowded, but for good reason bc food is incredible!!! Pineapple upside down pancake, killer granola..and biscuits to die for!! I plan on coming here whenever I'm in town!!! Yum!!!
