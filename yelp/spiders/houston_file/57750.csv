Kata Robata////So impressed by this place!! Definitely my favorite meal I've had in the times I have visited Houston. The sushi was sooo fresh, the lobster Mac and cheese was so dreamy and I have been waiting to try a wagyu katsu sand which and the flavors were insane!! Such a delicious meal, and the service was great. From the hosts, to server to food runners everyone was so friendly and made sure we were enjoying our meals. Can't wait to get back here and eat some more!
