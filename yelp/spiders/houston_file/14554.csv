JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would say this is one of my favorite ramen spots in Houston. I actually prefer Tiger Den in Chinatown but I hate driving out there and also waiting outside, so I come here as an alternate but I ain't even mad cause it's just as yummy! Parking is convenient because there is a garage behind the restaurant, and it's FREE. I've never had an issue finding parking in the garage, but I've also only eaten here during lunch hours which probably aren't as busy as dinner.
