JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regardless, we apologize if you felt slighted in any way, but from the sound of your review, you did receive your table assignment shortly after the other large group arrived. We hope this does not preclude you from future visits, and if you need further assistance, please ask for any of manager on duty. They will make sure your dining experience at JINYA is nothing short of excellent.
