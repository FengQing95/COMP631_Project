Uchi////To end the night we had delicious fried milk. I lovee milky desserts, so this is my fav. The milk sorbet, the crunchy covered milk and chocolate mouse and chocolate to go with it. Â The waiter also surprised us with the peanut butter jelly dessert which was his favorite. I loved the apple sorbet pairing that was on the pb&j dish.
