Uchi////We stopped in here for our first time at Uchi at 9pm because we happened to be in the area. We went in hoping for an open table since we didn't have a reservation. Luckily, there was only about a 20 min wait at that time! We went out to the little patio for a drink while we waited. Our table was ready as soon as we got our drinks so that was great! Neither of us were very familiar with the menu so our waitress's insight was incredibly useful. She was very patient with us as we asked questions.
