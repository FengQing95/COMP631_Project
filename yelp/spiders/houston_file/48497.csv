Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome service, amazing Benedict's & the pretzel breakfast sandwich was to die for. Full coffee bar too! Not a single bad thing to say. Went opening day & hope nothing changes. Will definitely be back! Fell in love with this place in Denver & so glad to have one in Houston!
