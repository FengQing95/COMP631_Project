The Pit Room////The atmosphere is really nice. It's a country style place and they cut the meat in front of you as you order but the food lacks taste. The beans were bland and the meat wasn't tender. I did like that they had their own pickled jalape√±os, carrots, and onions. But the food itself wasn't all that great.
