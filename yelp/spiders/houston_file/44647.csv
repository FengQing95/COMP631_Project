Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got the Almond Croissant and the Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie. The croissant was amazing; it was super flaky: crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The almond filling was subtle and sweet, very different from the overly sweet and cheap filling usually found in almond croissants. The pastry itself was also pretty huge. The cookie was very thick and also really good. It wasn't at all too sweet, and the walnuts gave the cookie a good flavor.
