Uchi////The waiting staff was extremely helpful and professional.  Throughout the dinner, I had quite a few scrumptious moments that felt like the rapture just happened--clouds parting and angels singing.  The sushi/sashimi needed no help from soy sauce.  I recommend anything escolar and foie gras on the menu.  The addition of Asian pear in some dishes cleanses the palate perfectly.  Tears of joy almost sprayed out of my eyes as I savoured morsels of the wagyu beef on the hot rock and the hotate (spicy scallop with avocado) sushi.  For those of you who are more adventurous, get a plate of the uni (sea urchin) sashimi--oh, heavenly so!  To wash, I recommend their lightly sweet moscato.
