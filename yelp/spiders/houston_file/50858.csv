Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////i have to update my previous review from 4 years ago.  it was 4 stars but they have lost one.  i don't know how fresh these ingredients really are.  if i didn't know better i'd say they found a jazzy new way of making the food beforehand or something.  it did not taste cooked to order, the food was way too cold for that.  i ordered the avocado benedict, add barbacoa.  hash browns extra crispy.
