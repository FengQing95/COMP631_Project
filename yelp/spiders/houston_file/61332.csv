Baby Barnaby's////The food here is absolutely delicious and well worth the wait.  It has a local diner sort of feel and can take a little while to be seated.  Instead of putting your name in with a hostess, there is a sign-in sheet placed on the patio that you should sign into when you first arrive.  I believe we waited about 15-20 minutes for two of us to be seated around 11am.  By 12-12:30 the cafe was pretty empty, so you should go later in the day if you're not willing to wait.  I ordered the Migas with chorizo and my friend ordered the green eggs- both were amazing!  Plates were large and we were both full and unable to finish (even though we tried our best!).  I don't think you can order anything bad.  The orange is fresh squeezed in front of you and is a must try.
