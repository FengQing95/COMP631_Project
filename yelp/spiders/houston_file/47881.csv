Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I would rate a 5 because I love this place but Im deducting a couple stars in hopes that management reads this. My husband and I had family in town for the superbowl so we took everyone here for breakfast. Service and food is always great so no complaints there but the host who is reaponsible for greeting all patrons had a neck full of badly covered hickeys. DISGUSTING! As a manager, I personally would not have let this gentleman work that day and until his neck was back to normal. It portays a poor image on him AND the eatablishment. Just gross. We were not the only people who felt this way either. We overheard many others discussing his neck. He should have been used in other areas of the restaurant and not have been placed front and center for all the see the remnants of his personal life.
