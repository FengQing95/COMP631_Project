Kata Robata////Our waiter Van was one of the best waiters I've ever had and was perfectly attentive and personable but didn't hover. We started with toro and tuna nigiri. Then the king crab Robata special which was delicious with a squeeze of lemon. Next was the tamago and Tokyo omelette nigiri. I wasn't a fan of the souffl√© like Tokyo style but my boyfriend preferred it to the regular tamago. The two orders of Kobe beef skewers were melt in your mouth delicious as always. Unfortunately they were followed up by the chicken skewers three ways and it just didn't compare to the beef. I liked the teriyaki style, my boyfriend liked the Osaka style, but neither of us liked the spicy style. It was covered in a thick layer of spicy mayo that had a too sharp taste to it. We ended our meal with an order of spicy soy ramen split in two bowls. As someone who doesn't usually like ramen anywhere, I can say this one is worthwhile. The broth was very rich. My boyfriend was a big fan.
