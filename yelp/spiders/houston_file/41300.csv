Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Worth the long wait to get the super delicious pastries. Tasted their Almond croissant, fruit pistachio croissant. Brioche sucre, kugelhof and kouign Amman and all is good but my favorite is Kouign Amman. So buttery and melted in your mouth kind of pastry. Least favorite is fruit pistachio croissant. Their flat white is now my favorite amongst the coffee houses in Houston. Strong coffee flavor and less steamed milk just the way I like it! Parking space is limited at their store front so you will have to circle around the neighborhood to find a spot. However, be warned that you will have to wait in line for at least 45-60 minutes before you can savor their delicacies. We are definitely will be back for more but on weekdays not weekend though. Love their decor. Oh yes, they have fancy boxes for pastry to go!
