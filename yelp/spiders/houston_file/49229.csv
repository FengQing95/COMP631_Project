Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got here a past 12pm and waited about an hour before getting seated. Our waitress was very friendly and came by a lot to check up on us. My friend got the danish blueberry pancakes, hash browns, and bacon (on the side). I got the breakfast tacos (with chorizo - extra $) a single blueberry pancake, and OJ. The restaurant was bright and cheery looking and super packed. There was seating inside and outside. Thank God we got seated inside bc it steadily got hotter the rest of the afternoon (Houston weather amiright...). I enjoyed my meal a lot. I ate all my tacos and half my pancake bc I was stuffed. The only complaint was that the corn tortillas were super flimsy...once you pick up a taco it falls apart completely...so they either need stronger tortillas or double up on every taco like real Mexican restaurants do. I just resorted to using a fork to eat it. I would definitely come back and try the other dishes. Maybe earlier so the wait won't be as bad.
