JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Finally: the two bowls of ramen. The spicy tonkotsu level "hot" which is allegedly the spiciest level of the three they offer. I did several add ins as well and I will say it was very tasty over all! I'm one of those people that eats pickled jalape√±os like candy so when I say I want spicy I mean S p i c y. Needless to say it could have been much much more spicy but they do provide a type of chili sauce condiment (and our waiter brought us chili powder as well) that you can add to increase the hotness. The broth was not super watery which I truly appreciate since I prefer richer thicker broths. I would highly recommend anyone ordering (probably any bowl) to add the fresh garlic and also add the seasoning sauce condiment they offer. This bowl alone is $11.80 plus $5.25 for the add ins. All in all I would definitely return, the food came out really quick and the portions were very generous and the price was fair! You will leave here with a full belly
