Kata Robata////Kata Robata was really an experience!!! I got nigiris: salmon, yellow tail, uni+toro+caviar, mackerel, unagi shirayaki, spot prawn, and scallops w foie grass. I also got the texas hamachi, lobster ramen, kobe skewers, uni king crab spoon, and amberjack w foie gras. Everything hit the spot, and I must mention ... THE RESTROOMS HAVE BIDETS!!! love that lol
