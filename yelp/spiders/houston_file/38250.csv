Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had the poutine appetizer ($13). The potatoes were over cooked, a total of 5 cheese curds, and the gravy was just meat grease with no discernible flavor. Every bite was just the taste of over fried potato. I believe the issue is that their "fries" are too thick. In an attempt to make sure the center gets cooked, they end up ruining the outside and therefore the flavor.
