Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was cool. Nice drinks. Decent service. It's been about 2 months since I was there so I can't really remember many specifics. Nothing overly positive or negative sticks out. It was a nice flow of business throughout the entire time there. I remember my burrito tasting good as well as the French toast.
