Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Decided to share an almond croissant with my sister, and. since they are huge, and asked them to cut it in half for us. The girl at the pastry bar looked over to her supervisor, asked him if they could cut it, and he said no. Not really sure why. I asked again, explaining that I didn't want to smush it by ripping it, the supervisor directed me to use the silverware provided at the bus station. Not my idea of customer service.
