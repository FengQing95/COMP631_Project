JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Amazing ramen, service, and environment! I got the Spicy Chicken Ramen with egg and thick noodles - the broth was flavorful, chicken was tender, and the veggies were fresh. Their portions look small in the bowl (big bowl with lots of soup), but don't be deceived - it's actually very filling.
