JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Crystal - Thank you for your review. Please know that if you're ever dissatisfied with our food for any reason whatsoever, just let your server know and he or she will make sure to remake the item, offer an alternative, or remove it from your tab. We're never going to be all things to all people in terms of food, drink or ambience, but we strive to make sure everyone leaves our doors happy, or at the very, very least satisfied. For what it's worth, our Tokyo Curry Ramen is an authentic version of Japanese curry, which is vastly different than Indian curry or Thai curry.
