JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When you first walk in, the ambiance is very mellow, relaxing, zen... You first see a "bar", which is pretty cool Bc you can sit there and eat your meal. If you would rather sit down at a table, the hostess will take you to the back room. The lights are very dim there. And the space is pretty open.
