Local Foods////First time and my truffle egg salad with vegan tortilla soup was exquisite. Will absolutely be coming back to check out the rest of the menu. It's a pretty cool vibe inside as well and staff was nice. You order up at the front and then they bring it to you- kind of like Jason's deli if you've been there before!
