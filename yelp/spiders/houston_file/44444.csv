Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Crossaint: GOD YES (yes, I actually said this out loud inside the restaurant; it was that good). This took me back to the cozy boulangeries of southern France. Fluffy, flaky on the inside, while a crisp texture on the outside held the whole thing together. These are huge and definitely shareable. Just buttery enough so you get lots of flavor, but not so much that it feels heavy inside of you.
