The Pit Room////Even if the food was mediocre, most of us have a place in our lives for mediocre food at the right price. The Pit Room was pricey for the stingy portions. A two meat plate is $14.95 before tax. I have never seen someone at a barbecue joint more stingy with portions than the guy cutting the meat at the pit room. For both me and my husband, he cut off a few slices of brisket, then spent a minute or two slicing off several tissue-thin slivers. I understand there's a ballpark amount the restaurant wants to include in each plate and they've got to keep the portions reasonably in check to make a living. I get that. But to be so precise and convey the impression that you won't give a customer even what cannot be more than .05 extra lbs of meat just rubs me the wrong way, and it's the final straw.
