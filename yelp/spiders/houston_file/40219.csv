Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Throughly enjoyed my visit to Bosscat. Been wanting to check this place out for a while and was not disappointed. Thought I had to make reservations but I was able to walk right in which was nice. Sat at the bar top and ordered a carafe of mimosas. Bar tenders were all very friendly. The bartender asked if it was our first time there and gave us a brief overview of the restaurant and where things were located. They only serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.
