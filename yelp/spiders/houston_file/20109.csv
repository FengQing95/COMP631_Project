Uchi////At $192 for 10 plates I want to be wowed.  I was not.  Some of the plates were just plain DISGUSTING.  I don't care for creative food if it doesn't taste good (ie rosemary gelato).  I think the total was about $250 after three drinks, the app, and the omakase before tip.  I expected it to be more.  And it would have probably been more if I had ordered a la carte (which I wish I did) and drank more than one adult beverage.
