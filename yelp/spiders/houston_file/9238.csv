JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I find the ramen here to have good depth in flavor and would recommend the spicy tonkatsu ramen if you enjoy pork and a moderate to good level of spice in your noodles and broth. But I would say that the spicy chicken ramen seems to taste less heavy than the former. I asked to add corn to my ramen and the slightly sweet and soft texture added a nice dimension to my noodles. :)
