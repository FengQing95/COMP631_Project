JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I'm disappointed to hear that you did not enjoy your ramen.  The Tonkotsu Black is our signature ramen and it is also our thickest broth.  If you don't like oily or thick broth, I recommend trying our Tonkotsu Assari or Tonkotsu White.  The Tonkotsu Assari is a mixture of two different broths (pork and clear chicken) which will give it a lighter flavor.  The Tonkotsu White is a mixture of pork and creamy chicken broth, but the mixture is a good balance so it doesn't make the broth seem oily.  In regards to the price, we are pretty much inline with what you will usually pay for a bowl of ramen at a typical Japanese restaurant serving ramen.  Factor in the fact that our pork bones are shipped in directly from California for better quality, we are forced to charge a little bit more to cover our costs.  The waitress should not have been sitting on the chair chatting with her colleagues and I will make it known to my staff that it cannot happen again.  I do apologize for that because my servers know better.  I hope you give Jinya another shot in the near future and please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Wynne & Sara) and we will love to help you pick out a ramen to your liking.
