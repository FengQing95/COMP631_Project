Uchi////Now, Matt. He should be awarded the Staff of the Day. Did he take care of us. And his recommendation of sea bream* in shiso oil and citrus with tobiko was the best dish of the night. Charming. I also like that different servers who brought out the dishes were all very well-versed in describing each dish. And when I asked one of them for wasabi, he was sharp enough to bring the ginger with it as well. Charmed.
