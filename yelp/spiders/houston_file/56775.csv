Kata Robata////We had Edward as our server and we are very satisfied with his service! He was patient and understanding towards our needs. He explained several items on the menu and made exceptional suggestions for my picky mother. :) We did not leave a single plate with food still on it. Everything was delicious! Definitely recommended from a family with lots of questions and a picky mother.
