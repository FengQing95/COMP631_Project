Baby Barnaby's////Holy smokes. When was the last time I had a breakfast this good? I honestly can't remember. The green eggs, with the perfectly golden crispy potatoes and the chicken apple sausage.... Whew. It was absolutely outstanding. I love that they have truly fresh-squeezed orange juice, too (you can watch the machine squeezing it from your table), and grapefruit juice as well. So good. Absolutely no complaints about the food. There was a great selection on the menu and everything everyone had looked amazing. Some really great healthier options as well, for those looking to watch their cholesterol or sodium.
