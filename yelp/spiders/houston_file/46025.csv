Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think that I was having latent cravings for that cookie I got at PDQ yesterday but sadly I didn't find a replacement here, even though this place is a bakery and that place was a chicken shack. Though there were many options, only two of them were actually cookies as I knew them. As soon as I spotted the pile of overly brown cookies sitting on a pedestal completely exposed to the elements, I knew I was going to be disappointed. There was no way they were going to be anything but burnt hockey pucks and suddenly my craving wasn't so prominent. But my friend had driven me over and I couldn't let her trip be in vain so I ordered a triple chocolate brown butter cookie, a vanilla macaroon, and a small box of already packaged snickerdoodles as a backup in case the first pick failed me.
