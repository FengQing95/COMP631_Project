Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pistachio croissant was good, with a nice and flaky exterior and moist and well layered interior. The flavor was on the sweeter end and although there was probably a teaspoon full of pistachio filling inside and green colored striped outside, I thought it was quite coconutty. The kouignn amann was delicious but also sweeter...especially on the exterior. The slightly crunchy and sugary outside lead to a buttery and flaky inside. They definitely make a great kouignn amann but I prefer mine a little less sugary. I also had the boston creme pie kugelhopf, which is essentially a boston creme donut tucked inside a cake...does that make sense? It was a unique texture and if you like chocolate and vanilla pudding...this is for you.
