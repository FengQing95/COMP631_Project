Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were so impressed during the first visit, that Snooze quickly became my #1 Brunch Spot.  The word "brunch" conjures up thoughts of good patio weather, sunny-side up eggs and of course, mimosas.  Snooze has all of that and so much more. There's an energy at the restaurant of pure excitement!  Strangers asking their neighbor what dish they ordered and a wait staff that is helpful and eager to serve.  I recommend the lemonade mimosa and the pancake flight, which is large enough to share.  The bacon is thick-cut and the house hashbrowns will make you completely forget about that whole "no carb" thing you've been trying out.  If you're in a rush, call ahead to find out the wait time then head to Snooze.  This place is a savory dining experience Well. Worth. The. Wait!
