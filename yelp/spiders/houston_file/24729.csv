Uchi////Uchi has long since made a name for itself in Houston as one of the most Â (if not the most) well known resturants for high-end Japanese cuisine. Coming with a party of 10 people during my first visit, I was able to sample a large variety of the dishes and small plates, in addition to some of the nigiri, rolls, and desserts. Though I can attest that Uchi provides food and service distinctly better than the average Japanese place in Houston, I do think there are other Japanese resturants where your money would be better spent.
