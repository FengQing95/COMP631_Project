The Pit Room////Ordering is pretty straightforward. There's no table service here. You walk up to a counter where you order your food which is promptly served on a tray and then you find a spot to sit down and enjoy! I ordered the 3 meat dinner option. This comes with 3 meats, 2 sides and a slice of bread and is super filling. I chose the brisket, pork ribs and pulled pork with coleslaw and potato salad. The meat was divine! The brisket simply melted in your mouth and the pulled pork and ribs tasted amazing especially when slathered with the accompanying barbecue sauce. The portions are generous so after eating this I definitely didn't need dinner!
