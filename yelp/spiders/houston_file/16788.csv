JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth was flavorless and the spicy broth wasn't even spicy. Not even a little bit. Not even chicken sandwich spicy. It looked good but everything tasted bland. It was like I was drinking water soup. The dumplings were good and the dumpling sauce was delicious but the ramen tasted like there was no love involved. My order was for pick up but the place looked nice on the inside. Very dark with mood lighting. I'm just sad the ramen was so bad. I really like ramen lol man, never again.
