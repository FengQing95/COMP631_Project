Kata Robata////Who would have thought this combination could be so delectable? As soon as it hits your mouth you taste the wonderful spice of the peppercorn salmon, the jalapenos, the garlic chili oil all placed on top. Then, as you bite, you encounter the lovely crunch of the fried asparagus and the sweet beauty of the spicy tuna. It's executed absolutely perfectly. The rice is properly portioned, the serving is ample. Well worth the price.
