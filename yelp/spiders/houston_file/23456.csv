Uchi////Words can't express my experience. I have never had better sushi and I'm sure I won't. We were sat at the bar and it is truly an amazing experience witnessing the chefs prepare the sushi right in front of us. Every single dish that we ordered was absolutely delicious and worth every single penny. Be prepared to burn a hole in your pocket for a full stomach, but every single bite is heaven.
