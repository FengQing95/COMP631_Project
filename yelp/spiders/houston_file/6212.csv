JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Takoyaki: 3/5 - Good, but I've had better. It was steaming hot, so thanks for that. But it was extremely mushy. It reminded me of eating a poorly wrapped roll of sushi. I tried to take a bite, everything fell out/apart. The taste was there, but there was so much sauce so each ball was as soggier than the last.
