Kata Robata////It looks incredibly bland on the exterior but the interior is really well done. Its cozy but not too much so, there is a big bar near the entrance and a nice outdoor area out back. I took away one star because the prices are a bit high but they can clearly get away with it due to the high quality and freshness.
