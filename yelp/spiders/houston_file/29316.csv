The Pit Room////Omg!!!!! Couple days before eating here, I was telling my husband that I wish there were a BBQ place where the meats are so seasoned by themselves and you almost don't want sauce bc it taste so damn good.  Well then we came to Pit Room!  Hands down, best BBQ I have ever had in my life.  We had just eaten, so we were being greedy and just got food because of the great reviews and how wonderful it smelled the moment you walked in.  I was like, did they spray roasted bbq and meat scent?!  Bc BBQ places don't smell this good the moment you walk in.  I always want to get a giant beef rib at BBQ places, but they never look appetizing.  The gentleman behind the register showed us I think it was a Kobe beef rib that they have on the weekends!!!!  Omg!!! I can't wait to come back and eat the ENTIRE thing by myself and then go into a meat coma! Lol
