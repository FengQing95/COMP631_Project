JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen spot in Houston! While I'm an adventurous eater and l love trying new dishes, I always seem to get the Black Ramen whenever I find myself craving ramen! I sometimes switch it up with add-ins like Brussels sprouts, which I had never seen before with ramen. They have big, tasty servings and if you order to-go they will package your fixings and broth separately so you don't get soggy noodles. This place is a staple for quick and yummy ramen!
