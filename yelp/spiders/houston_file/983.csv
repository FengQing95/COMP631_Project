JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here only a couple of times, due to hesitancy of waiting in long lines after work and on weekend nights - up to 1 hr. It's too bad that I work too far to come here for lunch as I've heard that lunch time wait is not bad at all. My favorites are Sprouting Up Ramen and Tonkotsu Black. The broths are very rich and well-developed in flavor - consistent, great quality! The meat whether it's the pork belly or minced always tasted fresh. I've tried several of their small plates, which in my opinion are not memorable. The salmon cilantro sashimi was bad - it tasted fishy and expired, plus the sauce was bleh. Maybe that was just a fluke. Anyway, Jinya will definitely be my go-to place for ramen!
