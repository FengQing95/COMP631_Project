Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pancake was gooood! It was fluffy, good portion, and overall good taste. The syrup was good too. Only reason I did not give the pancake a 5 is because of the same issue as my main plate....the pancake was on the cold side. Nothing like a hot batch of pancakes. This fell shy in terms of temperature, but the taste was definitely there.
