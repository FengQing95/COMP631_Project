Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally had a chance to check Snooze out after 3 failed attempts. My fault though - I always showed up in the late morning on a weekend. Crazy to think that I would be lucky to snag a table with no wait on a nice, sunny Sunday morning. Disclaimer: This place can have a wait time over an hour on the weekends!
