Uchi////Chefs tasting is the way to go! The waiters/waitresses are very knowledgeable and nail the perfect array of tastings every time. I recommend the shag roll, the Hama chili, hot rock, yokai berry and the fried milk is life changing. It would be nice if they expanded the cocktail offering Â - but they have a nice wine selection for any occasion.
