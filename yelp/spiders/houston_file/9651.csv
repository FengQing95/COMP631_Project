JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We live JINYA and eat here often.  Tonight with family I. Town and little ones asleep we ordered dinner for pick up.  Everything rated great however our two orders of chicken Ramen had no chicken at all.  The wonton ramen was well liked and the umami ramen was very good as well.
