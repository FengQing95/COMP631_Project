Uchi////The ambiance is really nice and there's modern furniture. It's a nice spot for hanging with friends, a nice intimate date, or dinner celebration. The events manager Jessica B. came by and greeted us. She took time to show us their private meeting room. It was really nice, spacious and had a TV hidden behind the wall that could be used for a meeting or a private event. They also host sushi making group classes upon request. She then told us a little bit about the food they offer and that we would be in good hands with our waitress.
