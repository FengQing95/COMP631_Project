The Pit Room////I don't normally like BBQ.  And I'm picky when it comes to meat.  So I was a bit skeptical upon arrival, but decided to continue with ordering since I had heard a few people rave about it's food.  Yeowmygawsh. The people were right.  They were out of the brisket and pulled pork (guessing the best two) so I have no comment on that, but three of us each got the three meat platter and tried most of the other options--all were delicious!  My only regret is not getting the shredded chicken tacos after watching the cheese get cooked.  A local in front of me ordered that and I immediately had food envy upon watching it get prepared. I'll probably never be in Houston again so will just have to imagine its deliciousness.  And after you pick up your food you can head on over to the bar.  I had the Fireman Blond--excellent.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the locals/employees were friendly--chatted with one of their part-time bartenders who was hanging out there on an off day and had a great conversation for a couple hours.  If I had to choose, my least favorite out of all of them was the pork ribs--slightly chewy for me.  But otherwise I can't pick a favorite... well, maybe the chicken.. but the sausages were pretty good as well.. Either way, for people visiting Houston I'd highly recommend stopping by, getting some great local BBQ and grab a local beer while you're at it.  And someone, anyone, please have those chicken tacos for me.
