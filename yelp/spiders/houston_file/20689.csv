Uchi////Hot Rock Wagyu Beef (raw then cooked) - This was my first time ever trying wagyu beef and it didn't disappoint. My first go at it, our server, not our waiter, told us to cook the beef then dip it in Ponzu sauce to avoid sticking. He was totally wrong. The 500 degree rock took straight to the beef and wouldn't let go leaving a sticky mess on our perfectly smooth rock. After a second try, we realized that you have to FIRST dip the raw beef in Ponzu sauce THEN cook it. What happens is a perfectly sliced, perfectly marbleized yummy goodness that melts in your mouth. Very rich and buttery that has a slight bacon taste. It almost has no beef texture to it or taste.
