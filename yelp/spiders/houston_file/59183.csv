Baby Barnaby's////The staff here is so friendly and welcoming. I swear it makes the food taste even better. I enjoyed a delicious plate of the green eggs that were nicely seasoned and fluffier than I imagined. I was also happy with their potatoes, which were crispy and reminiscent of tater tots. I left feeling very full! Even on a Monday at 11 am there was a wait, but there is a bench area to have a seat. The menu isn't terribly long, but has a number of appealing choices including low carb / low fat. It's nice that if you order coffee they give you a carafe, but are also excellent about checking to see if you need more. Overall a very cozy and nice place to eat breakfast.
