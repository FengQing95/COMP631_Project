Local Foods////One of my favorite restaurants!! The sandwiches are fantastic. I usually opt for the crunchy chicken sandwich or truffled egg salad sandwich. I really liked their falafel sandwich too, but I think it's been taken off the menu. :( Their pretzel buns are DIVINE; I'll probably buy a bag of the buns alone sometime. For the sides, I typically get the kale and quinoa. Mmmmmm.
