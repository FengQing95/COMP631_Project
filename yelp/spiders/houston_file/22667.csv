Uchi////You'd be doing yourself a disservice to go in assuming you're going to a standard sushi place - as our waiter, Jarden (....), informed us, the menu is more of a tasting adventure - and while I object to anywhere that takes itself seriously enough to tell me how to use to menu....this is one of the few times that the guidance has been appreciated as they use a lot of novel flavor combinations Â - aka, smoked yellowtail/yucca/marcona almond/asian pear/garlic brittle - but once I let my hair down and dove in, I was treated to a masterfully constructed, unexpected meal.
