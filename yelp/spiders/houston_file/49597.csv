Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of the best brunch places in town! However, Â keep in mind that the grass grows 2 inches before you can actually get seated at this place. Wait times are usually between 45 minutes to an hour on the weekends and sometimes more depending on the the time you arrive. The parking situation is a bit annoying since they have about negative two spots for the whole restaurant. While writing this review I realized both of these cons can easily be avoided if you decided to literally SNOOZE outside overnight which is why I'm still giving it 4 stars.
