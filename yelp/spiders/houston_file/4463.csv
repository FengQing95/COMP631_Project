JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was spot on too!! Come early otherwise it filled up pretty quickly around 6:30pm, and there is a wait when we were done with our dinner. Â We will definitely come back to try out all their different flavors ramen on the menu. Yay!! Don't have to drive to to Tiger Den in Chinatown anymore since this is the best ramen shop in town.
