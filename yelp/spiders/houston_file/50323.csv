Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My plate was presentable and a good portion. The hashbrowns were yummy (I always add cholula) and the ranchero sauce was decent, but sadly my poached eggs were cold. This really took away from my enjoyment of the plate. Cold eggs make me feel sad - whomp whomp. Â We got our food in good time, so not sure how they cooled so fast. Regardless, ask me...did I finish my plate? Yes...yes I did.
