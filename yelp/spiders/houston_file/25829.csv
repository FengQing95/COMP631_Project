The Pit Room////Super friendly and helpful staff. New, clean atmosphere. Fatty brisket is really good, and venison sausage has great flavor. It is drier than your typical pork sausage, but that's to be expected from the leaner meat. All the sides are homemade, and the potato salad and Mac n cheese were fantastic. A few beers on tap (including Shiner) in the restaurant, or take your food next door to the bar for over 30 beers on tap and 20 types of whiskey.
