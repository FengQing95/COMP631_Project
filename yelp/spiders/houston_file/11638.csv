JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Further, in our business, if you're not changing, you're not improving, and therein I presume lies the rationale for JINYA Corporate to take things off our menu and to add them. To draw a comparison, McDonalds only offers their McRib sandwiches and Shamrock Shakes during certain times of the year. I believe this happens at many franchise concepts across the nation.
