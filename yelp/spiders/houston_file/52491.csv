Kata Robata////Kata Robata is such a great sushi place. The only reason I only gave it four stars is it's a little pricey. Their sashimi (especially the salmon) is so fresh and delicious. The sashimi omakase is fabulous, and the lobster mac 'n cheese is also pretty awesome. Everything i've had there has been great though I don't actually remember what else I've eaten there :P Service is generally pretty good.
