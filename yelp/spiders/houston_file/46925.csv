Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is probably the best breakfast brunch place in Houston. The wait is always long but I'd say it was worth are 2 hour wait any day. We had a large party and got to try lots of food. Everything tasted sooo yummy. Service and food were both 5 stars!! We had Megan as our server and she was friendly, outgoing and overall exceptional! I'd ask for her! Don't be discouraged by the wait it's well worth it! You never know you might get the special surprise! Enjoy!
