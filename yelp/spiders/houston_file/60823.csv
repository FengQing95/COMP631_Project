Baby Barnaby's////To start talking about the dishes, almost every previous review mentioned about the green eggs therefore I ordered it. This plate was AMAZING. Anytime I eat eggs, I usually have it with some sort of condiment, but the green eggs here are so good that I don't have it with any condiments since I don't want to alter the flavor of the eggs. Secondly, the apple chicken sausage that came with the platter was full of amazing flavor. I'm just impressed that everything that are included in the platter all tastes amazing!
