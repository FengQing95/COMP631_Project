JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA Tonkotsu Black: 2/5 -Also, never again. Pork broth, pork chasu, kikurage, green onions, nori, one whole seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and thin noodles. My biggest gripe about this bowl was that I couldn't taste ANY garlic in it. I specifically chose this bowl because it had garlic chips and garlic oil. I don't know if there was too much going on in the bowl so the garlic disappeared or if there wasn't enough in the first place for me to notice its presence. Whatever the case, I was disappointed. Next gripe was the broth. It was soooooooo heavy. Like, ridiculously heavy. I also find the bowls they serve ramen in to be a weird shape. They're very high, with narrow bases. It gives the illusion that you're getting a lot of food, when really it's less. I like broth, and I think it's an important factor when making ramen, so I don't understand why you'd use these bowls because the noodles were piled high (thanks to the narrow base) and peaked through the surface of the broth. It made me realize how little broth I actually got. The only saving grace this bowl of ramen had was the egg, which was literally perfect. So gooey and runny! Other than that, nothing really stood out in terms of flavor. I feel like this bowl of ramen was confused with itself. It didn't know what it wanted to do or where it wanted to shine, so it decided "let's be a little bit of everything!". All of the ingredients kind of just mushed together to give different textures, but all one taste.
