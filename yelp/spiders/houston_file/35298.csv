Local Foods////Sandwiches come with two sides. The sides differ from location to location and I believe they also change depending on what is in season. I ordered the summer pasta (pasta salad with cherry tomatoes and olives) and the potato salad. The summer pasta is good if you like olives (if you're into that kind of thing). The potato salad was incredibly refreshing. It had a nice dill flavor and felt so light.
