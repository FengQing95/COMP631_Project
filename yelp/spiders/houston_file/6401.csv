JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here 3 times and needless to say, 3 days in a row. I used to go to Tiger Den because that was the only ramen joint I knew of and it was convenient considering I'm always in the area. This place never has a wait when I go and the ramen is amazing! Four stars because I came here to eat with my coworkers and nobody was allowed to be seated until the entire party was there, which we weren't aware of. They ended up seating my coworkers first and didn't allow my bf and I to be seated with them because we came in later by a few minutes. Luckily, we quickly made friends with the server who was kind enough to offer us the table right next to them. The hostess was rude as hell about the situation instead of explaining their policy about the entire party being present before being seated. Other than an annoying experience with the server, the food was amazing.
