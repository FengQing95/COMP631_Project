Baby Barnaby's////The food here is quite good, and the fresh squeezed oj is excellent as well, though a shade on the sweet side. I got the two eggs, two sausage, potatoes and toast, and the gf got the green eggs and sausage. Both were well made and good, though the pork sausage leaves just a little to be desired.
