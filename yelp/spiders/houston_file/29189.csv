The Pit Room////This place came highly recommended so when we got there I was strangely let down. Granted we came around 7pm on a Monday and they were out of brisket. We tried the pork ribs, the sausage and the brisket tacos. Pork ribs were good but unremarkable, the sausage tasted a little plain and the brisket taco while the meat was good, the tortilla was a little hard and stale. For the number of reviews, I was expecting more. If you're looking for bbq, Truth BBQ and Pinkertons were better.
