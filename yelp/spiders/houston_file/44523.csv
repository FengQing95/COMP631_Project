Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have to admit, I went there expecting the hype to not measure up to the experience and I was wrong.  My friend was nice enough to invite me for a little early birthday dinner on their pizza and beer night (Sunday) and I was blown away.  Their pizzas were amazing and fresh.  Their salad had stuff in there that I didn't know existed and the dressing was amazing.  Their cookies are as thick as a burger and decadent.
