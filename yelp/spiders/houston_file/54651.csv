Kata Robata////What a terrific restaurant. They have really great sushi happy hours. I had a delicious "non-traditional" roll called the Longhorn. It. Was. Amazing. Also had a beautiful and diverse seaweed salad. Yes, orchids are edible. Plus, the entire staff was really patient as we were in a large group, and had brought an ice cream cake for the birthday person. They kept it chilled for us until we were ready for it. Definitely want to go back and indulge in more sushi. Presentation of all the food was lovely as well.
