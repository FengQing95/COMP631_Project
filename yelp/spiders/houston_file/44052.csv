Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They used to have olive bread, but they stop making them. They were not upfront with it. Every time I went there to ask for olive bread, they replied, honey bread ( I tried it it is bad). Anyway, one person say they only made on weekend. And when I go there on weekends, they don't have it. ( after the long Â line I am a bit frustrated)
