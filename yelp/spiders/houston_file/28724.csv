The Pit Room////Such a great find! Looooooove the brisket here. You get high quality tender, thick slices of brisket with a delicious rub Perfectly cooked! I'm used to my meat a bit more 'moist/fatty' but this place is probably slightly better for my heart and still hits the bbq craving. You can order a taco version of your favorite meat as well. Not just plain tacos, but topped with pickled onions and various sauces and salsas.
