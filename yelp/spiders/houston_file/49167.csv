Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the corned beef hash with over easy eggs and sourdough toast. It was pretty delicious. The eggs were cooked to perfection. Although it was busy, the wait time for our food wasn't long at all. We were a large party and they were able to accommodate us into two booths and repositioning them to make a figure eight. I got to try their green sauce and it was the perfect kind of spice that I like. I wanted to try the spuds deluxe and I was pretty conflicted with all the options that were presented to me. I did find out that there is a location in California and I definitely plan on visiting that location as well.
