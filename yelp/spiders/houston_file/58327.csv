Baby Barnaby's////Love it! Consistent, wonderful, fresh food with great service. Recommend the weekday special. Scott is great and makes everyone feel at home. It's worth it, yet expect the possibility of a wait after 9am. Outdoor seating on weekends. Took off one star for slower service on Wednesdays.
