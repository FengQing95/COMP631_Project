JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Prior to opening JINYA, I visited no fewer than 50 ramen shops around the world, paying anywhere between $8 and $15 for a bowl of ramen. What I quickly learned was that each ramen shop was unique in its own way -- from the noodles to the broths, and especially the price points they target.
