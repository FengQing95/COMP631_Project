The Pit Room////We've gone here all three days we've been in Houston. The pulled pork is my favorite, but the brisket was amazing as well. The macaroni and cheese is the best side dish, but the potato salad is good too. The cole slaw is very bland and I would not recommend it. The pickles available at the condiment bar are very good but spicy. The sweet tea is good. Would definitely recommend!!
