Kata Robata////I had to wait until my whole party was here, in order to be seated. As soon as my friends came, we were seated right away. However, our seat was in an awkward position, facing the kitchen, right in front of the sushi bar. My friends and I thought the placing of the seats were a little weird. Could be better, but that's besides the point.
