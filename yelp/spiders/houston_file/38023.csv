Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Amazing, amazing, amazing! Incredible drinks, even more incredible food, and great ambiance. I'm not much of a whiskey drinker, but their Bosslady cocktail is beyond delicious and aesthetically pleasing too. Their short rib and salmon-succotash main dishes are DELICIOUS.
