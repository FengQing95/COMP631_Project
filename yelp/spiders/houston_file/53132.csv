Kata Robata////To start, the cocktails sound quite unique and tasty with their infusion techniques, but the cocktails we tried were rather bland, especially in comparison to how I expected they would taste based on the menu description. We were very impressed with the food quality and the freshness of the food. What we were less than impressed with was the creativity of some of the dishes, and so when we received the food, we were very impressed with some of it, but less than impressed with the rest.
