Local Foods////I ordered the chicken crispy sandwich with a side of kale salad and cabbage cole slaw (comes with two sides or a soup) while my sister ordered the salmon sandwich. We ended up trading half the sandwich which I think creates the ultimate meal. The chicken sandwich is very tasty because every part of the sandwich had it's own personality. The bread was soft with a glazed exterior while the chicken was tender. Diving into the details are the pickles and the little crispy things they put inside, perhaps potato chips which make a world of difference. Then came the salmon sandwich. I was surprised at how much salmon was in there and how great it taste. The salmon was wrapped between a poppy seed bagel and spread with cream cheese I believe. If I had to choose the better of the two sandwich, I wouldn't be able to. They were both great. Lastly, the kale salad was surprisingly NOT disgusting lol. They somehow made kale taste good.
