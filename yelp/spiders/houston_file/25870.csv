The Pit Room////I do not understand these high ratings may be I ordered the wrong stuff on a bad day. I ordered the beef rib at $22/lb and brisket. Based on these good reviews I thought this was going to be good. But alas I was wrong, as soon as I cut in to the rib the liquid fat just oozed out, I am not talking a little bit but at least 1 tablespoon worth and as I continued to eat the rib it ended up being 60 to 70% fat, so I paid almost $22 for a thick bone, 70% fat and may be 15 to 20% meat that I can actually eat. I felt nauseated after eating this too, I think it is because of all this fat. Beef rib is not worth the price. The brisket was good but not something I will pay such hefty prices. So be careful what you order as I learned this lesson the hard way.
