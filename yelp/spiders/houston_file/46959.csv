Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have eaten at the Snooze in Denver and was thoroughly impressed.  When I saw one was opening in Houston I became excited.  The blueberry danish pancakes are my go to.  The flavor combination of the blueberries, lemon and streusel is spot on.  Service is always great.  Everyone is super friendly and they check on you periodically.  The ONLY downfall to this location, the parking.  The lot is small and parking on the side streets is a tasks since blocking driveways is not cool.
