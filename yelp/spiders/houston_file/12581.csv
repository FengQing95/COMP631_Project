JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Met a large group of friends here for a birthday celebration. Inside was very cool, with lots of interesting decor to look at. I started off with the polyphonic gin & tonic, which was surprisingly delicious. Very lightly sweet, not too harsh as I was expecting. For an appetizer I had the cilantro edamame hummus, which was very good. I also tried the pork belly bao buns, which were good. For my main course I had vegi out maki, which was good and surprisingly filling. We debated on desserts as they sell large ice cream sandwiches in fun flavors, but ultimately we were too full. Great spot, would definitely come again.
