Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is one of my favorite places in Houston. The pastries are beautiful, but the regular food is also amazing. I've had the steak frites, and that is to die for. The baguette is perfection; I love getting the bread board. The flatbread is just right for my kids. I've had great salads there. The fries are really good. When people come in from out of town, this is one spot that always makes them excited to be in Houston.
