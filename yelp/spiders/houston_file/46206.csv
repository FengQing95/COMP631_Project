Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////With three of us there, one of us did the HRW offering and the other two of us just ordered off the regular menu. Definitely go during HRW if you get a chance - that ended up not only being a good deal but also impressed the most. As for me, I ordered the steak salad, which ended up being more of an Instagram photo than a culinary experience. The steak looked nicely cooked but some pieces were chewy. The salad was not "gigantic" in my opinion, like the employee helping us said. And it ended up being nothing special but greens with some radishes, tomatoes, blue cheese, and the steak. Not a bad salad but again, was expecting more.
