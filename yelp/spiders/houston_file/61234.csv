Baby Barnaby's////Be prepared to wait, this place is always packed. Their green eggs and orange juice are a must try! They have their own orange juice maker which was pretty cool and explains why their oj is so good. Their potatoes and pancakes were also delicious! Didn't have a single bad thing here and our server was also wonderful!
