Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First the place is busy and it nice to see the place full of customer because that's a good sign. But what a disappointment it is, we needed some utensils and they were all dirty. The forks still have food stuck on them, the spoon was stain with coffee stain, and the knife was spotty from soapy water. They were being lazy on the cleaning. The bottom of the plate have food stuck to them. It was so cross that I want to leave but we already order our food so might as well finish it.
