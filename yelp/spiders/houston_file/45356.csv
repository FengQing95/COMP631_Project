Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is probably in the top 5 brunch places on my list and there's a reason why. The food and baked goods are that good. Common bond is a French bakery that has tons of various pastries, macarons, desserts, a coffee bar, and kitchen. Today we had brunch here. We got here at 9am and there was already a line. I don't think I've ever been here where there wasn't a line to be honest. They often sell out of their baked goods. So get here the earlier the better.
