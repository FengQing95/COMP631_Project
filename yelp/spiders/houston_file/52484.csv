Kata Robata////We went for the "omakase" experience at Kata Robata, which means "it's up to you" in Japanese. This means it's up to Chef Hori-san on what you will be eating for dinner. He created 10 dishes for us - from on and off the menu or if he has some fresh fish, he may try to put something together for you. If you've never experienced an omakase dinner, this is the place to do it with one of Houston's few Japanese sushi chef, who couldn't be nicer or more fun with some amazing food
