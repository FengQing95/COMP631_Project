Local Foods////Had the Smoked Salmon here with pumpkin seeds and fruit (watermelon). The Smoked Salmon was served with arugula, bagel, and cream cheese. Everything was very good. The bagel was light, cream cheese cold and spread well, and salmon not overpowering. A solid place to eat with friends or family and you want a guaranteed good meal. The staff was respectful but our cashier kept picking up the phone every few seconds to answer calls when we were trying to order. I understand that this is a function of Local Foods being a popular place to eat but it still felt wrong. Great place!
