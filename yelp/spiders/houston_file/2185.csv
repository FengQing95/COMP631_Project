JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////*Disclaimer: No special treatment expected by vegetarian me; if you're a restaurant and focus on meat, go ahead. But you'll probably have a vegetable dish or two and some sweets. So I'll review if those are good, cuz you offer them. I'll give a BBQ place a 5 based on potato salad, bread, pickle and onion generosity, and cobbler.
