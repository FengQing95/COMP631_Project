Uchi////In my 9 years of yelping, this is my 13th 1 star review. It takes a lot to get a 1 star rating from me. Head Sushi Chef Yoshi was incredibly rude, condescending, and really does not seem to be someone who cares about customers. Given I have worked in the restaurant industry in the past, I have a lot of respect and give the benefit of a doubt when things may be slow or go wrong at restaurants. I have so much love for chefs and people who create amazing food. However, I will never condone disrespect and rudeness.
