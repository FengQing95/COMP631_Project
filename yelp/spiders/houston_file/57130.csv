Kata Robata////For some positive news though, the drinks were decent! I ordered the 99 Problems and she had the lychee drink. They tasted different but in a good way. Also, our waitress was fantastic! I wish I could remember her name. She was very knowledgeable, friendly, and although she had a lot of tables to handle, she did a thorough and excellent job explaining the menu and specific items to us. She was attentive and quick on her feet.
