Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////    The front hostess wouldn't let us put our name on the wait list (which was over an hour long), because we wouldn't give a cell phone number. When we asked why we couldn't just leave a name, she got pretty rude and said a phone number was "required." Not everyone likes to give out their cell phone number.
