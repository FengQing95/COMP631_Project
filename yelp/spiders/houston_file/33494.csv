Local Foods////Truffled egg salad sandwich: Great. This is the best sandwich at Local Foods. I resisted getting this the first couple of visits, because, really, how good can an egg salad sandwich be? I was wrong. The slight touch of truffle oil elevates the delicate flavor of egg without overwhelming it with a synthetic aromatic flavor. The hearty pretzel bun is the perfect foil to the delicate egg.
