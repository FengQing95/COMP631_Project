Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friends and I discovered their Monday night steak nights for $20/person. It's a great deal that's definitely shareable, and includes a large portion of steak, salad, roll, spicy mac and cheese, and green beans. Everything came out piping hot, steak was moist, and even my non-spicy-loving friends enjoyed the "spicy" mac and cheese.
