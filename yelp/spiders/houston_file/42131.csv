Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place. Food and coffee is decent but what really shines are the baked goods. I've pretty much tried everything there from the tarts to the croissants I loved it.  The macarons are one of the best ones I tried in Houston. They are on par with Laudree in NYC and Lette in LA.
