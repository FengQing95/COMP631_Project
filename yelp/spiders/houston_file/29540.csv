The Pit Room////The Pit Room is cafeteria style.  You queue up and order the meat first then move down the line for the sides.  It was an intimidating experience for me as a tourist.  Line was long and understandably they tried to move things fast and the customers behind me were impatience so that added onto my nervousness.  Granted the menu is small and I decided ahead what I wanted but I didn't have the exact item memorized so as soon as I utter the item pork sausage the butcher already took out the sausage with cheese and jalapeño and started chopping it up.  What I really meant was the beef sausage because I can't eat things too spicy.  My fault for not reading the menu carefully.  Then I asked about the two different kinds of ribs they have and when I tried to order the beef rib the butcher said something that I didn't catch and I ended with pork ribs which was fine with me.
