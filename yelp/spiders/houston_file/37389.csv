Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We started with the pimiento cheese. Having visited Charleston in the fall, I had a chance to taste many different types of pimiento cheese and none of them tasted overwhelmingly of cream cheese like this one did. I could even see clumps of it not fully mixed in. The dish is served with torn pretzel bread, carrot sticks, and cucumber chunks - I get trying to lighten up the dish, but the veggies seemed like an odd choice.
