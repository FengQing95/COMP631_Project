The Pit Room////This is my first review after 3 visits. I believe this is a solid BBQ place in Houston, better than most, but a bit inconsistent.  Brisket has been moist or dry depending on the visit. Sausages are good and ribs as well.  Sides are also ok. I have had Charros (good) Mac & cheese  (very good), potato salad (awful) and elote (good). I do recommend this place but I hope you are lucky to be there on a good kitchen day.
