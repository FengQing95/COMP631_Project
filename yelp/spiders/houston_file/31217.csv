Local Foods////Online, I had eyeballed an interesting pork cubano sandwich that wasn't on the menu at Local Foods.  This was my only disappointment (and has since been updated), but I quickly moved on to the Crunchy Chicken on the pretzel bun with a side of Lemongrass & coconut chicken soup... and a Karbach Weisse Versa for the cost of a soda!  (Why not?!)  My lady had the Capered Tuna sandwich (she's a moth to a flame when capers are involved) and the same soup, along with the mint tea.  It was all fantastic, balanced, and fresh.
