Uchi////So the only reason this isn't 5 stars is because the little hostess at the front was literally the rudest and most condescending person I have ever met! I have wanted to go to uchi for yeaarrsssss so finally, for our anniversary, I drove in from magnolia and met my husband. The hostess was curt, unprofessional, and just a plain B! I was shocked. So i had to stand in the front area waiting on my husband in awkward awful silence while a new host (male) came out and offered everyone standing in the waiting area a cocktail menu or a chair out on the patio to grab a drink while they waited.... but the mean girl acted like i was the biggest idiot for asking if we could enjoy happy hour before our reservation at 6. I was excited to come to the restaurant and she ruined my experience from the get go. LUCKILY, our waitress was the best person on the planet and once I spoke with a manager about how the hostess need severe coaching on how to treat people, we had the best time. We got the 6 course meal and a few drinks from the bar. They brought over some complimentary dishes and we just had the best time. We were so happy with how the rest of the evening was handled but still can't believe how rude that girl was!!
