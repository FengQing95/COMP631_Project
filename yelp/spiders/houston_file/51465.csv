Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The boyf and I shared the Flight of Pancakes - we got the Pineapple Upside Down, the Blueberry Crumble, and the Bourbon Pumpkin Spice. The pumpkin spice was good but my least favorite - I'm not use to the bitterness that the Bourbon provides. The Pineapple Pancake was littered in butter which means it was delicious! The blueberry crumble has no complaints from this self proclaimed pancake aficionado.
