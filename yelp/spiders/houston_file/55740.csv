Kata Robata////This is one of my favorite sushi places close to work.  The quality of their sushi and sashimi is always so good!  Today, I came with 5 other co-workers.  I couldn't decide whether to go with the ramen or do one of the lunch combo specials.  I end of ordering two Folie gras, Combo Roll B, and a salad.  My manager ordered the Santa Barbara Uni and boy, couldn't stop staring at it!  He said it was good so I made a mental note that I am getting that next time.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and I was so happy to get they feedback.  However, when it came time to pay the bill, our waiter told us he couldn't split the ticket.  I was so disappointed.  Our normal waiter that we usually get (who's nicely built and tatted up on his arm) has always split the ticket for us.  Painfully, we had to figure it out on our own, wrote on the back the total for each person +tax and handed it back to our waiter.
