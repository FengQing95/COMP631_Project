JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Definitely a solid place to grab some ramen. The experience itself is a little different though. I have been to a few ramen bars now and this is the first one that I have been to where you sit at a table full of random people. Â It's great because then everyone is able to see you get the ramen all over yourself!
