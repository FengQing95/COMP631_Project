Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and French Toast make this my favorite breakfast place! What makes it even more exciting is the fact that they are currently building out the former Arcodoro's space across from the Houston Galleria to open one directly behind my condo and just 2 blocks from my work! Look for me *almost* every morning once it opens! The service here is always great and you cant go wrong with breakfast food! Just wish they would open 2am to 230pm as this would make Snooze 6 STARS!!! ;)
