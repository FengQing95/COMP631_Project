Baby Barnaby's////Literally the best eggs I've ever had, the green eggs were amazingly AMAZING. Everything was made perfectly and fresh starting with the fresh squeezed orange juice. Also the apple pecan pancakes were to die for...more like die for, then be revived just so that you can get one last bite, they are that good! My husband described the pancakes as "Apple pie meets fluffy pancake". Must try and a amazing start to a happy Valentines Day!
