JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now here's where I very well could lose some/all of my credibility. I by no means am a ramen expert. I just know a good bowl of soup when I taste it. My biggest indication of a good ramen bowl is whether or not the broth itself can stand alone. I found myself scooping out each spoonful of tasty broth in the Tonkatsu Black broth each of the times I visited. Need I say more?
