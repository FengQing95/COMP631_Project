Local Foods////I really wanted to like this place but I was not impressed. As a gluten free vegetarian I was hoping to have a lot of options for me but not so much. Also, this place is crazy pricey - almost $4 for a soda. Super long lines to order, food took over 15 minutes to get and the parking was awful.
