Uchi////First of all, I would reccomend coming here during happy hour, or "Sake Social" (which runs 5-7 pm) , and only during happy hour. Uchi's menu is comprised of both cold and hot tastings, in addition to nigiri, rolls, and seasonal specials, but without the Sake Social, you'll easily spend 70 to 80+ (unless you do one of the set courses) to leave satisfied. The Sake Social menu includes a pretty large variety of smaller versions of the standard menu items at a very reasonable price. Ordering mostly off of the Happy Hour menu and a few select things from the standard menu will ensure you have a filling, delicious, and not overly pricey experience.
