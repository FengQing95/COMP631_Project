Kata Robata////The service was quite poor at times. Some of us had special 'Father's Day' inserts in our menu. Well, we were there on Father's day and looked over these special menus. We ordered something off one of them and were told we shouldn't have those menus, that they were old. We explained to the waitress that they said Father's Day. She seemed perplexed and wandered off. Â She was semi-perplexed the whole night.
