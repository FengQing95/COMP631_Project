Uchi////For starters, I learned an entirely new way to eat sushi and never thought so much about the actual purpose of "building" a bite of food. As a plate was put in front of us, often the food server would both describe the dish, as well as advise us on the recommended way to eat it, which we have experienced at many other high-end restaurants that consider food as art (Morimoto Waikiki, for example). And flipping the individual bites of sushi upside down into your mouth made it an even more delectable experience than I ever imagined.
