JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////To start, each and every server is required to give a full introduction and greet their table. Secondly, our servers ARE required to check on their tables at least 2 times before even dropping checks. Obviously, the server failed miserably in both these categories. In regards to your Tonkotsu Spicy, unfortunately it DOES NOT come with an egg as it says on the menu. We carry 13 types of ramen and only half of them come with an egg. Of those that come with an egg, only 2 come with a WHOLE egg while the other ones come with a HALF egg.
