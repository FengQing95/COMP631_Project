Local Foods////Seeing how this restaurant is listed on yelp as Houston's top restaurant choice, Â you can feel confident dropping 11 or so dollars and cross it off your to-try list. But I also agree with others, spending $11 dollars on a sandwich and small sides would make a college student feel guilty, especially when there's Chick fil a and Guru Burger's lunch special. Those are more of a bang for your buck. But heres the catch, after eating at Local Foods, your stomach feels healthier. You feel good knowing that you're helping local farmers. And of course the causal but hipsterish vibe is enjoyable.
