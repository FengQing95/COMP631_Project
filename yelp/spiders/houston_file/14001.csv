JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry you weren't completely satisfied with your ramen. In the future, please know that if you are at all dissatisfied with your ramen, your server will be happy to replace it with something else, or modified to your liking. For instance, many of vegetarian patrons who order the Vegetable Soup Ramen modify it to be "spicy" or "hot," and in some cases "inferno" or "double inferno," which are off-menu, spice-level options. Also, as a franchise concept, we can only offer ramen dishes that have been developed by our company's R&D department, who are are currently working on more vegetarian options. But in the meantime, I think you would have enjoyed some of our new vegetarian Tapas options, such as Caramelized Cauliflower, Crispy Kale Lollipop and Brussels Sprouts Tempura. Thanks again for the review, and for mentioning that your 4 other friends loved what they ordered.
