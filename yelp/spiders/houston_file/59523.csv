Baby Barnaby's////I had the Annie's burrito, super healthy and tasty, fit my "diet"/clean eating plan perfectly!  My boyfriend had the migas with chorizo and he might as well have licked his plate clean.  Our server was a little rushed playing hostess as well, but she kept up nicely.  I love that they leave a pot of coffee and carafe of water at your table, don't have to wait for much besides your food once you get seated!
