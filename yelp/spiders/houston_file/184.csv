JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Loved Jinya. Broth was rich and flavorful, thick chewy noodles, and fatty pork was good and fatty. Definitely best ramen in Houston compared to Ninja and Kata Robata. I would say Jinya was comparable to Ichiran. The only improvement opportunity for Jinya would be to get a ramen ticket vending machine and remove the whole process of ever interacting with a human being, as the Japanese do. Kidding ... the ambiance is perfect. :)
