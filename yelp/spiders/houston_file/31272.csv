Local Foods////This place is great!  I chose this place by trusting my fellow yelpers because they all offered great advice on this place.  It was definitely a good choice.  It's got great decor and great food.  It's a place with a good selection of sandwiches with various options you can't find in many other places.  For all the people that love the healthy, vegan food lifestyle, you can be happy here because they the quinoa, orzo, kale, and chips that will hit the spot.  It's all very fresh, as if they got it from the farmer's market.  I got the duck confit sandwich and I gotta say, it was great!  Then I tried the crunchy chicken sandwich.  That one is probably my favorite.  It has beautifully cooked chicken that will hit the spot on any lunch, dinner, or snack break.  If you haven't been here and you are craving a sandwich but you're tired of the normal everyday stuff you get at subway or potbelly, then check this place out.  You will not be disappointed and probably leave promising to come back sometime.
