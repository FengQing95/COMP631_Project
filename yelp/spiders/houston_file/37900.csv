Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I don't think the food in particularly good. I usually prefer to come here for drinks at the bar and a couple of apps for Happy Hour since the bar is large and usually upbeat. It seems this place is more about gimmick food concepts than offering up good food. Lots of options for better food close by so skip the food but get a drink.
