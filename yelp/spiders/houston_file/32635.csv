Local Foods////We must have arrived at just the right time, our meal was brought to us really quickly and it was just delicious. I ordered the kale salad and coleslaw sides while David got the chips and barley. Seriously, everything was really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale but David loved it, and he didn't enjoy the barley too much and I liked it.
