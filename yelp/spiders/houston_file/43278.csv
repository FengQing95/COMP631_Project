Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'll keep this short and sweet. The walnut chocolate chip cookie here is very similar to the one at Levain bakery in NY. I was excited to try something comparable to the greatness I had in NY and doubted it would be similar. I am completely shocked as to how delicious and almost identical this cookie is to the one at Levain. I'm a huge dessert person but not so much a cookie person. I'll make an exception for a spectacular cookie though and this was just that. It was warm and gooey on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. Very similar to the one in NY but maybe a hair smaller and that's if I'm really trying to find a difference. It's still a large cookie and more than one is overwhelming.
