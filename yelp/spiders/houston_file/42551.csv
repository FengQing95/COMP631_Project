Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a special place.  Looking back on my Texas food trip that covered four cities, this is one of the places I will actually miss.  I think this may be the only branch of Common Bond in Houston, so that would mean the pastries are made in back of house and are exceptionally fresh.  As I have learned in Paris--eat your croissants relatively fresh--they don't hold up to humidity well.
