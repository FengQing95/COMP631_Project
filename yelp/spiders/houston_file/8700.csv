JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback and your visit to Jinya.  Having been to training at Jinya Corporate, I can see where you are coming from in your description of the curry rice.  When I made it for the very first time, the ingredients included minced apples and mince pork.  I grew up eating my mom's curry rice which had big chunks of potatoes, carrots and chunks of chicken.  This was the first time I witnessed Japanese curry made this way.  Being that it's a franchise, we pretty much have to make the product as we were taught.  I do agree the presentation need improvement and the order you had was a small size.  If you take a look at the Jinya corporate website, it shows what a large order is supposed to look like with baby greens as a garnish:
