Uchi////Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We had a great time. Our server Matt made excellent suggestions when we asked him for recommendations. Also, it was our first time here and never did any of the staff made us feel "strange" (that pretentious vibe workers at upscale restaurants give off sometimes when you dk how something works). On the contrary, every staff member took the time to explain to us what we were eating Â and how to eat it. We appreciated that very much! This restaurant is on the pricier side but I didn't even mind the bill in exchange for such a fantastic culinary experience and service. Keep up the great work!
