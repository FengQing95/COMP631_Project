The Pit Room////This is the best BBQ in the city. There will definitely be a long line, but it moves quick and is well worth the wait. Whenever we have family or friends come visit we make it a point to go visit. I've had just about everything on the menu and have not been upset by anything I've ordered. Get the two meat dinner (or more) - worst case scenario you've got some amazing left overs (but our group has never had that problem)
