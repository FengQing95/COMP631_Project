Local Foods////Okay, I still love Local Foods.  I have gotten the shrimp and crab sandwich a few more times and it's always effing delicious.  The kale salad and cabbage slaw are my go-to sides.  However, I must say I was pretty disappointed with my Spring Harvest salad I picked up for dinner yesterday.
