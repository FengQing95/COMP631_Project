Uchi////The FOOD, first and foremost, is unlike any sushi/Japanese restaurant you've ever been to.  Just to clarify: Uchi is NOT a sushi restaurant! It's more along the lines of an "upscale Japanese" or a "Japanese-tapas" category. Yes, they serve sushi, but it's only ~15% of their overall menu, which revolves more around tapas-style dishes titled "Hot Tastings" and "Cool Tastings."  Their sushi itself is solid, but there are plenty of other restaurants that do "pure" sushi better. Their "Tastings" are all very different and unique in presentation and flavor, and were all delicious (we ordered so many, I couldn't tell you which ones I liked more or less.  They were all equally great). I do regret not trying their nigiri/sashimi, which will have to be saved for another visit. I will put another DISCLAIMER though: do NOT come Uchi if you're looking to stuff your face!  It's not that kind of restaurant.  Their portion sizes are quite small--think Underbelly small--and are best split amongst two people. Any larger, you'll have to order more dishes. FYI: their Fried Milk dessert is TO DIE FOR.  GET IT. :)
