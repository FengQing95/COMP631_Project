Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Awesome place for weekend boozy brunch in the city! Fun vibes, great service/staff, and & well presented food all around. We got the short rib chilaquiles (very flavorful sauce) & donut burger (very filling) which both good. The red velvet churros are a MUST HAVE (ours came out nice & warm, the dip was delicious) ! Highly recommend making reservations
