Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I can here for brunch with my family and we ordered almost immediately. My mother ordered a mimosa which arrived completely flat. We asked for it to be changes and the resulting mimosa was much better, luckily. I made a special request to have cheesy eggs and I was so happy that Bosscat could make these for me. Â My mom and Aunt both ordered the veggie omelet and my cousin ordered the regular burger with Bosscat fries. The food took an incredibly long time to come out. That is understandable as it was a busy Saturday but it seemed like despite this, our server had to be prompted to check on our food. The food itself was good, but it wasn't amazing. For the price I paid for this meal I would have expected more, they didn't have sriracha for the eggs-which is a weird request but I felt like sriracha was a staple at this point. Moreover, they didn't have any lattes or brunch like coffees or juices made fresh which was also surprising to me. Oh well, I'm glad I came and tried Bosscat because the food was good-but not amazing by any means.
