The Pit Room////This place is my go to for BBQ in Houston it's usually so good and you can smell the moment u pull up to the parking lot, but this last time I invited a big group to come and taste my favorite BBQ and I was extremely let down. Idk what happened the sausage was dry the brisket was dry... I asked how everyone liked it and it was just ok?? I was so disappointed bc usually it's not like that. I hope that was just a bad batch or bad day I def have to give them another chance but I hope they don't let us down again
