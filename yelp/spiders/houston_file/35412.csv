Local Foods////The lettuce was fixed in a chopped California style which I really loved. I mean nobody likes getting a big stalky hard piece of lettuce in their salad which so many restaurants give you, which I never understand. This probably was the most perfect BIG salad I have ever ordered. I could not finish the lettuce parts, but I did fish out all of the goodies and were they delightful. This place is vegan friendly but for others you can also find something on the menu for your tastes as well. Even if you are not a salad fan you may love their salads. They have more than 1 to choose from.
