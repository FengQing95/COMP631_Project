Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great location enjoyed the ambiance very trendy spot! So thats my two stars... maybe brunch isn't your thing or managing groups of about 20 or so! First off only 2 waiters attending to the entire party, which left a lot of our party unattended. Not a single time did the manager on duty come to introduce themselves or check the temperature of the guests. Ok to the food Burgers were decent, the fries were extremely over cooked across the entire table around 10 orders or so. My Aunt asked for a coke refill to several different runners no one brought it out until she made a fuss. Majority everyone at our table enjoys a nice cocktail after the initial order no one came to follow up or offer to take any additional orders. Loaded hush puppies with the over easy egg not a fan either! Not sure if I would ever come back! Give it a shot maybe you will enjoy just beware!
