Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think of myself as a chicken and biscuit/waffle/any carb connoisseur and this one is amazing. It's a chicken breast and part of the wing. They leave the skin on and it creates a crunch and flavor that just goes with the dish without it feeling too greasy. The breading is corn meal with other spices. The biscuit is soft and slightly sweet which compliments the crunchy chicken and slightly spicy sausage gravy. Oh plus. There's a poached egg to top it off. I will definitely be dreaming of this dish for a while.
