Kata Robata////The seafood was all extremely fresh and our table enjoyed every course. There was one course of kobe beef that was too fatty for me, so I didn't eat more than one piece. Our server actually talked to the chef and brought me a fresh squid hand roll to replace that course, which was extremely nice of them!
