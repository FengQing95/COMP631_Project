Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Unfortunately I love this place for breakfast and lunch especially. It's not the cheapest option, so be ready to pay between $10-$15 for breakfast. Worth it. I get the soft scramble with bacon. It comes withi a perfectly toasted baguette slices which I pretty much use as my spoon. Yum! Their scones and croissants are on point. The "queen aman" or however you spell it is crazy delicious and dangerous. I love the toasted ham and cheese baguette for lunch and if You are feeling extra splurgy get the Parmesan fries! Whoa! The chocolate chip cookie is not my favorite but there are so many other great options it's cool. I have only had dinner from here once and don't remember it especially so I guess I'll have to try it again. Add this to your regular calorie and cash splurge list for sure!
