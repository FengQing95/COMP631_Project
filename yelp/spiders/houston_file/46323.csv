Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Today was our third visit to this pastry haven. Maybe fourth? Either way, I'm well overdue for a review. Today's particular visit stood out as their front patio offers patrons a dog friendly option. You mean I can devour your perfected pastries, lavender lattes, read my book in the sunshine and hang with my pup? Heaven!
