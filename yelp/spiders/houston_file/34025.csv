Local Foods////I got the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, my dad got the Short Rib Sandwich. We also got a cupcake to take back to the hotel to eat later (it was pretty good). The lady that took our order was super pleasant. One thing to note about this place is how much sense the location of things make. It sounds weird, but the cups were all right by the soda/water fountain, the to go boxes were there too...it just made a lot of sense and makes everyone's life easier.
