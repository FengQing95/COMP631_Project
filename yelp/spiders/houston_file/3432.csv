JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mike - Thanks for your review, and we appreciate your kind words. The founder and CEO of JINYA Ramen Bar is named Tomonori Takahashi. He owns several restaurants in Ebisu, Japan, and brought the JINYA concept to Los Angeles several years ago. He has since franchised JINYA to numerous cities across the country. We were the third franchisee to sign up.
