Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went for Sunday brunch. Got there when they opened at 11 and the place filled quickly. I got the chorizo hash which was cooked very well. Had a good portion of meat and a perfect poached egg sitting on top. I wasn't a fan of the "biscuit" it came with. It was more a cornbread which threw me off. I pictured a plump golden pillsbury commercial esque biscuit. That aside I would come back for the meatloaf hash.
