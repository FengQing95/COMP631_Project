JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now, the second visit was just not my cup of tea. Since I knew I wasn't a fan of the ramen, I opted my favorite favorite Japanese dish after sushi, the curry. I had many Japanese curries in my time and they have all satisfied my cravings, one after another. I don't know how to begin describing thing experience without sounding kind of mean and rude. My 3 friends all ordered ramen and everything came out at the same time so we could all enjoy our food together. At first glance at my plate of curry, I was mortified. It literally looked like an inverted cup of rice had been flattened on the plate, then smeared with... dare I say it, poo. It has got to be the worst presentation of curry I've ever seen. I mean it was just like the curry sauce with tiny pieces of stuff in it. The room was pretty dark. I was just baffled looking at it. We all took turns inspecting it and laughing. I obviously know that you cannot just judge food based on its appearance because as I've learned in Spain, people don't care much for presentation as they do for the taste. So I start mixing the curry with the rice and I took a bite. The first thought was "what is this?". It tasted like mush that had a bit of curry flavor. I tried another bite and I just couldn't swallow it. I'm not one to ever return a dish, but it was prompted by my fellow eaters that I should since I had barely touched it and no point in just sitting there to stare it at. The waitress was very kind and took it away, then came back with a menu in case I wanted something else. I ended up not ordering anything else because I couldn't find something that interested me. Which is fine. But man the curry... I will upload a picture and you can share with me your opinions.!
