JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Brussel Sprouts Tempura was nothing special, but it was a solid start to the meal. They were fried to a nice golden brown, and the fact that they were brussel sprouts was a nice change of pace since vegetable tempura usually tends to be green beans, zucchini, broccoli, or potato. As for my ramen though, I will say that I was semi disappointed. The broth was too salty in my opinion, as the soup over powered the flavor of the rest of the noodles. The noodles themselves were alright, as they weren't too chewy or too firm. As for the actual size of the bowl of noodles, I was also a tad disappointed because I felt like they could have gave me some more noodles and toppings in proportion to the size of the bowl...but oh well. A friend of mine also ordered the Tan Tan Men (no soup ramen), so I got to try some of that. The flavor of the sauce was actually very rich and tasty, so I would highly recommend that dish for anyone who isn't really in the mood for typical ramen.
