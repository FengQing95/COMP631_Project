JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have thought there wasn't a good ramen in Houston, but I have changed my opinion after visiting this restaurant. Me and m bf had tonkatzu black and Cha-cha ramen and it absolutely broke the rumor about bad ramen in H Town! The service was excellent, so prompt and customer-oriented. As for the desert, I had Annin tofu and it was incredible! This place is a must to visit for everyone! Won't regret!
