Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've returned to Snooze a few times since an unfortunate experience some time back. I have not been disappointed. Food was delish--the sweet potato hash bowl is a savory and filling, low-calorie delight. Pancakes are always light and fluffy. I stoped by today with family visiting from Atlanta and we all left smiling. We got great service from Melissa and the manager was quick to make things right when my sweet potato hash was missing the kale. And I finally used the gift card that Kate sent to me after my previous review. Way to make a comeback, Snooze.
