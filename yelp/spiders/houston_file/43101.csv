Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////3. Fruit tart - 3/5 Pretty average.  The fruit was really good (but how much can you mess up putting fruit there).  The tart itself was mediocre.  The cream filling was average and the crusting was so hard it was impossible to bite through.  The fruit tarts I had at whole foods are much better than the ones here.  Really disappointed.
