Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After lunch,my sisters and I came for dessert. The only reason why there isn't 5 stars is because it's small and it was super crowded. Other than that, this place has the most amazing macarons. There were all different flavors but I only got three. Lavender vanilla, strawberry and apple pie. I will be coming back to try all the rest of them. Hands down, some of the best in town that's for sure.
