Kata Robata////- "Nitro Milk Chocolate" dessert: it's kind of like chilled freeze dried ice cream.  I expected this to be weird (and similar to an exotic but not very good dish I had recently had at a snobby molecular gastronomy place) but it was actually delicious with a just-creamy-enough texture.  Highly recommended.
