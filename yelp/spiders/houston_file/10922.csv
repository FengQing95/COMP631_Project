JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend heard about this place through a friend of his and we finally decided to try it out. Sunday night and there was a bit of a wait but it was totally worth it. My fave part is the vegan little tacos. Â I had the vegan ramen and I will def come back for this. Staff was friendly and the place was clean. Great job to the staff.
