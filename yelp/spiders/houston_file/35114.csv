Local Foods////Thankful this spot still keeps vegan food on its menu. Easy to park and easy to order. Their speciality cocktails are always amazing. Lavender lemonade is really great. The vegan frito pie is outta this world but you'll love the vegan meatball sub. Hope one day they bring back the vegan chili and vegan gumbo. Very nice and attentive staff. Always a pleasure to visit here.
