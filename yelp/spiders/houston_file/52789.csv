Kata Robata////Overall, Kata Robata is just okay and therefore, way overpriced. I don't mind spending the cash when it is worth it (Uchi, that's to you) but this place just falls short in too many ways. I can't believe anyone gave this restaurant more than 3 stars. I would have if not for the cost. We ended up spending $115 including tip for just the two of us and that was for a little bit of food and 3 drinks, most of which were on happy hour so imagine what they would have normally cost.
