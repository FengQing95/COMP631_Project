Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu offers something for everyone with sweet or savory, light or heavy, etc.. I ordered the breakfast tacos with chorizo and avocado. I was a bit miffed that they charge $1.75 for avocado and I only got 20% of an avocado, but that was short lived. As soon as I took my first bite I was in breakfast taco heaven. Why isn't everyone putting hashbrowns in their breakfast tacos?! Genius. The plate was pretty big, I could only eat 1.5 of the 3 tacos. Small eaters could probably share. Also, the serrano hot sauce that came to our table was amazing. I am going to buy myself some and start putting it on everything.
