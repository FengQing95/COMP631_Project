Baby Barnaby's////We went here on my first day in Houston and was pleasantly Dupree's to find this gem. The wait was about 20 minutes for two people but it was well worth it. We ordered the Green Eggs- delicious but did not have artichoke as described. We also ordered the healthy plate which came with phenomenal chicken sausage. Great service and would recommend!
