Uchi////4 for the food creativity. 2 for the slowness of service. We spent 3 hours dining. 3 Freaking hours! We ordered the 6 course sampling meal in addition to some other side dishes. We had to give up on the dessert. Each dish took about 20 min to come out. And these weren't meals, they were merely bites. And that was on a Wednesday night. We got there at 545 and didn't leave till 845.
