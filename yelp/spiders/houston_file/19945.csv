Uchi////I really like Uchi and it is my FAVORITE restaurant in Houston. Everything there is awesome. I could go on and on but there are so many good reviews this is really pointless. Just go and try it. Unless you can make the HH be ready to spend a good chunk of change - but worth it. I took a date there and she really enjoyed it. It helped close the deal, lol.
