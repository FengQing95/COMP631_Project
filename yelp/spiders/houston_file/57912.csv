Kata Robata////Our last visit we ordered the shrimp sashimi with fried heads. Not an unusual order...you should try it. However the server brought the "presentation" out without the fried heads and told us to take the sashimi off the plate and they would take the heads back to fry. ?? This has never happened in the past. Typically they bring it all out together. Strangely odd so we asked the manager if this is new. He seemed clueless and unapologetic and inexperienced.
