Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////LOVE THIS PLACE. Laid back, excellent whiskey. I strongly recommend the Kentucky orange blossom. The food is always delish and they have a great brunch menu on Sundays. It's worth the stop, if anything negative had to be said it would be the parking. It's a bit unusual but nothing to complain about.
