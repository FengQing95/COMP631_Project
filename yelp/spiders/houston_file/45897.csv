Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Disclosure: I'm usually not a huge fan of salted caramel or red velvet, so that may be the reason for my neutral feeling. The red velvet, however, had a strangely salty cream that, together with the sweet cookies, made the flavor bolder and not quite as delicate as the other ones, and I'm not a fan.
