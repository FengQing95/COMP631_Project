Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was worried about parking and lines, however I was happy to see there were two separate parking lots and lots of street parking. You may just have to look if you don't see parking right away. As far as the line, there were about 10 people in front of us and it moved rather slowly which I was semi confused about because menus were passed out to the folks in line and orders were promptly taken once you move up to the line. Anyway, I thought I knew what I want when I first glanced at the menu, but then when I moved up the line and saw ALL the sandwiches, pastries, breads, muffins, sweets - it thew me ALL off! Maybe that's why the line backs up. I wanted EVERYTHING IN SIGHT!
