Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered the chicken torta, an iced caramel latte, and the citrus macaron. The torta was so delicious; the meat was shredded and crispy, the bun was fresh baked and had the texture of a toasted cloud, and there were huge butter lettuce leaves hiding a delicious spicy sauce. The latte was good too. The macaron I also liked; the filling had that melty quality a good macaron should have. One of the waitresses with cute Heidi braids also gave me a free sesame chai macaron to try, which really made my day. Hoorah for good food and kind strangers!
