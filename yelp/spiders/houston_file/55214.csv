Kata Robata////I ordered small Asahi and Soy Spicy ramen noodles. The ramen was great! Chef "Mr.Manabu Horiuchi" We call him" Hori san"He is a great chef. Even he doesn't specialize in ramen noodles. He made great ramen noodles. The price was $14. It was higher than Tiger den's ramen noodles. But It was as delicious as ramen noodles at tiger den.
