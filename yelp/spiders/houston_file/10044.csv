JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered Jinya #3 Assari (thick noodles, see picture) and my friend got #1 (Tonkatsu black) which tasted more like miso to me. My broth and noodles were DELICIOUS. The egg was bland. The cha siu pork melts in your mouth, and I wish they gave you more than one slice. I read somewhere the chef wants to focus more on the broth and noodles, so he got that right, but this girl wants her meat!! We got there around 7 and were seated immediately. We left at 8 and the waiting area was FULL. I heard they open until 2 am? That's nice for the late-night post-midtown munchies. Â I think the best thing about this place is its location. Free parking on levels 2 and 3 of the garage, and inner loop. I prefer Jinya's broth over Kata Robata's. Between the noodles...it's a tie. Guess I'll just have to try them again (and again, and again...;)
