Kata Robata////We ordered the Emperor Roll, the Caribbean Roll, some hot sake, wine, beef sashimi, and miso soup. Â The rolls were very good, sake and miso soup ordinary, and the sashimi was excellent. Service left something to be desired. They didn't clear our plates for a long time and there was about a 10 minute wait for our 2nd round of sake from the time we ordered it. We were already done eating and saying that if he remembered it we were just going to send it back because we were ready to go. But in that instant he remembered it was sitting on the bar and served it.
