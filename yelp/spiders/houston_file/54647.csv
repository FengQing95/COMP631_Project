Kata Robata////That being said, this establishment does provide some fantastic dishes. I've enjoyed bone marrow in the past and was curious when I saw it on their menu. This dish came out as a spread for some toasted small breads. I highly recommend this dish and really hope others will not be dissuaded to try it simply for the fact that it is bone marrow. It' provides a fatty sweetness that melts in your mouth. This was an extremely enjoyable dish and a great appetizer before the main course.
