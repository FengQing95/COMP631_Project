Uchi////Uchi is a great restaurant to share small plates with a group of friends and/or family. The menu descriptions may sound outlandish, but the presentation and taste are like none other sushi or sashimi. There are combinations that you would never think to marry unless you have a creative mind like the chefs here at Uchi. My favorite is the Yokai Berry made with Atlantic Salmon and Dinosaur kale, asian pear, and yuzu.
