JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////An experience at this location of the Jinya chain is reliable for kind and pleasant service, a clean and welcoming atmosphere, and very accessible ramen offerings for the average person who is not familiar with ramen culture simply thinking of it as a bowl of soup. If the music were turned down that would be a big upgrayedd to the experience so each table would need to do a little less shouting to be heard and cumulatively that would make the interior not just look nice but have a better feeling of SERENITY NOW to pair with a not-as-spicy-as-would-be-loved chicken ramen.
