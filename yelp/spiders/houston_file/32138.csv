Local Foods////I had a truffled egg salad sandwich. I was worried that truffles could ruin a perfectly good egg salad sandwich. But there was just enough hint of truffles to make it interesting - the egg flavor dominated. And the pretzel bun was simply one of the best sandwich buns I've ever tasted. All the ingredients were spot-on. My sides of beet salad with wheat berries and tangy kale with raisins and pine nuts were both so good, I wasn't disappointed to have missed out on the great-looking homemade chips. Next time.
