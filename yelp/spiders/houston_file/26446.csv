The Pit Room////Pricey but good.I like this place i ordered the 3 meat plate with and extra side. The only thing is the portion sizes are SUPER SMALL. the sides were served in these mini bowls which i thought was for a toddler and more of a sample size instead of an actual side. But over all the food was good. the only thing was my sausage was super dry the pork ribs and brisket however was really good.
