Uchi////I've had absolutely nothing even questionable on the delicious scale here. The amazing brussel sprouts, the light and fresh hama chili, the bold Walu Walu and perhaps the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, the foie gras negiri is too splendiferous to even try to put into words. It's most of a religious experience than anything else.
