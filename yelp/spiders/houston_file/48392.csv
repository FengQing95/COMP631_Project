Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now, my food is cold and completely unacceptable because there was NO follow up in your restaurant.There are far too many breakfast options in your neighborhood that I will now give my business too - Over Easy and Scramble being just two. I go out for breakfast three to four mornings every week spending Â on average $250 every month and you have lost my business for good.
