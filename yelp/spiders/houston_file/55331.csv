Kata Robata////This was originally my favorite sushi place but it's kind of more now a place to be seen rather than a place to eat.  The food is still really good but it wasn't as delicious as I remember my last visit. The wait time if you don't have reservations is a little crazy, waitstaff is however very attentive which I like.  We had an assorted sashimi platter which I felt wasn't prepped very well.  I am used to the precision I see at Japanese restaurants in Toyko where everything is beautifully sliced and cut and presented.  The sashimi platter was a bunch of irregularly cut pieces of fish that were tossed into a bento box...not exactly what I was expecting when I am paying a lot for sushi.  The last time I was at, kata I did not have the sashimi and I just remember presentation being more professional.  The food was fresh but I am a little disappointed in the presentation and will have to decrease my rating.
