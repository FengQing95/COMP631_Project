JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't think this place will ever disappoint me. The service, interior and food itself is so awesome. I was obsessed with JINYA to the point where I would go there every week and ask my friends to try it too. Also, there besides parking on the opposite side, they have a whole garage to park at.
