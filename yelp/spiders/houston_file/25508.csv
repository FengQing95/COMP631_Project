Uchi////I arrived on time, there was no curbside street parking so I parked half blocking a driveway next to one of their signs, clicked the link, entered the number, submitted, and nothing happened.  I waited roughly ten minutes before finally calling the restaurant.  Someone picked up but did not say anything.  I called back and as it rang, the back door opened and someone finally brought my food (10-15 minutes late).  She greeted me by complaining about how their phones are having problems and said nothing about the delay.
