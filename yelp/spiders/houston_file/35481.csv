Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is amazing! I went in on the promise of a good whiskey selection (it was great) but the food was amazing. I was torn on what to get and Megan at the bar talked me into meatloaf bites, cajun brick chicken and red velvet churros and it she was didn't disappoint. Killer meal, great whiskey and awesome bartenders. I will be here every time I am in Houston.
