Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ambiance: This establishment is a happy mix of oranges and yellows with simple, modern decorations. It's crowded. So crowded that you're likely to wait an hour or more to be seated on weekends. Both indoor and limited outdoor seating (with large orange parasols) available. Fortunately you can put your name down and receive a text when your table is ready. You can specify indoor or outdoor preferences. Parking is also very limited (10 or so spaces,) so most of your time might be spent looking for somewhere on the street to park. Once you're parking and waiting I'd stick to the actual establishment - not much to do in the vicinity (Kroger, Walgreens, apartment complexes.)
