Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Are these the best croissants I've had in my life? Quite possibly. It doesn't seem quite fair to compare them to ones you can get in France, but I bet you they could hold their own! The bakery case here is full of sweet and savory options: breads, cakes, desserts, pastries, quiches, etc. It is truly a brunch paradise that I only allow myself to indulge in rarely since I always go way overboard and can't control myself. I would have never expected it, but I had one of the best pieces of cheesecake in my life here - it was literally perfect. Paired with a latte and I was in heaven. Parking is a bear, but hey - that's Montrose for you!
