Uchi////I'm actually taking the time to write out this review because this place deserves all the love it gets. First, we used the complimentary valet in the back because the parking was impossible, but that's just how that area is. I recommend making a reservation like we did because we were seated right away. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and personable. There was nothing here that wasn't absolutely delicious. Pretty much everything we had was on the recommendation of our amazing server because I couldn't decide. Going this route is a good idea if you aren't a decision maker because you will not be disappointed. Â
