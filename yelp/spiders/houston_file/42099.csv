Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just a couple of treats from. Common Bond took us to heaven and back --- the Kouign Amann and Blackforest Cheesecake. Me and my girlfriend were shopping around the little shops at Montrose during a weeknight, and as we were walking to find something to eat, the aroma of fresh baking and bread wafted through the street. And even if it was late, at 8pm, we decided to trace the source. How quaint and pretty this place is, with an array of bread, and pastries. The very friendly pastry chef introduced us to the Kouign Amann who she said was usually sold out and that we are lucky to be around to try them. Well well well she wasn't joking about this particular croissant! Sumptuous.. And we are coming back for more of their specials on the menu
