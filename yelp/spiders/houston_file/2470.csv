JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We went in Nov 28, we got there and waited more than 1 hour to be seated! People that arrived after us were sat ahead of us (at least 5 tables) when we told the hostess about this she kept on saying we were next, then a big group of people arrived and kissed her and they magically got a table ahead of us, even when they were not on the list. About 6 parties that arrived after us and that were also waiting, left when they noticed this. We asked to talk to the manager and showed him our name in the list scratched and rewritten afterwards, told him about the people that had left when the hostess let her friends in first and his answer was "we are not holding you here to wait, you can leave anytime", after this we obviously left, went next door to Piola, where we got seated after 10 min (the place was packed) and had a wonderful dinner. I don't think any of us are ever coming back to this place and I also don't think they'll stay in business for long with that attitude and lousy service.
