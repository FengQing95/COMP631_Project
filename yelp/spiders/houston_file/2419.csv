JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brittany - Thanks for the 5-star review! We agree that ramen really hits the spot during inclement weather, but from our experience, Houstonians are still eager to dine with us even when it's scorching out. We are forever grateful. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
