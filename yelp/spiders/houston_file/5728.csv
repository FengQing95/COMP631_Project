JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now comes the ramen... Our group enjoyed the ramen. The broth was deep and rich in flavor. It marries well with the other contents in the broth. The pork belly has a good amount meat to fat ratio which I like. If the ramen is good I would say it was a great meal. Many thanks to our waitress for letting us stay beyond our meal to chit chat without rushing us to leave. That's another plus in my book.
