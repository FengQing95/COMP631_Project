Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After being seated we decided to tell the waiter the appetizer we wanted. However, he informed us that on Sundays we can only order off of a very limited menu and not the entire menu. Therefore we had to settle for the brunch menu. I decided to go with the burger and a side of fries. The burger was ok not bad but not good. As for the fries they were a thick cut and I am personally am not a fan of those types of fries.
