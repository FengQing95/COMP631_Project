Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was excellent! We ordered the OMG French toast and the Â "create your own" eggs. (I got a spinach, goat cheese & sausage egg scramble) It was amazing! The only thing that put a damper on our visit was the manager on duty (I believe that her name was Maria) She was yelling at our server to move "faster" in front of our table and a few other customers. Our server was actually delightful and helping us to make informed choices. It was a very inappropriate display of management and definitely showed a lack of quality leadership on her part.
