Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My only comment to Snooooze: Time to expand. Right? Business is booming but...I've looked at all the hipster clothes in the thrift shop next door while waiting and it's made me hungry! When you have to expand it means you're doing something right. Snooze is brunch done right! Now get us more tables!!!
