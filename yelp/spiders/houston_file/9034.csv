JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm also not a fan that there's add-in suggestions for their featured ramen (No. 1, 2, 3) - to me, ramen isn't complete without a couple of ingredients, most notably seaweed or an egg, so if you do an add-in or two, you're sitting at $14 for a bowl of noodles. Add a combo, and you're pushing $20. For lunch! What!
