Kata Robata////Let's get to my favorite part. And it wasn't even a particular type of sushi or entree...it was just a damn order of soup. I ordered the uni chawanmushi, which was described on the menu as a "japanese style egg custard with fresh uni, chicken, shrimp, shitake, gingko nut, & yuzu zest." I'm a sucker for steamed egg, so I thought I'd give this a go. The soup was brought out to me in a little clay pot about the size of a teacup. Cute little pot (key word being LITTLE), but uh...I was pretty underwhelmed by the size of the serving, considering its $9 price tag. But good lord, whatever this stuff lacked in volume, it TOTALLY made up for it in taste. I took the lid off of my little clay pot, and I was looking down at a perfectly silky pool of steamed egg, topped off with a slice of fresh sea urchin. I dug my spoon in to take the first bite...and holy crap, this was perfection in a cup. The egg was luxuriously creamy (it melted in my mouth), which provided a perfectly comforting and smooth textural background to the bits of shitake mushroom, gingko nut, and shrimp that you would pick up along with it. The sea urchin was just as soft and creamy as the egg was, so when you paired the two together, you ended up with this incredible mix of flavors of the egg along with the slightly sweet and briny taste of the sea urchin, all swirling together in a silky-smooth concoction on your spoon. :) Believe in the little clay pot of eggy love, my friends. BELIEVE.
