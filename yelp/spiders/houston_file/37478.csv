Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////You'll probably find me here on a pretty regular basis. I'll be by the whiskey room sipping on my Kentucky Orange Blossom. Special shout out to Henry, since he's been my waiter as of late. Super friendly, down to earth, and up beat person. I can tell he loves his job. Look forward to seeing this place grow and expand with time!
