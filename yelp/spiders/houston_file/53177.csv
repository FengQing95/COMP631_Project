Kata Robata////We got seated on a really tiny table they had booths but we only got a tiny table. The ambience is very dark so bring a flashlight. The place was very scrunched, so it was very noisy, I had to almost scream to the person next to me for them to hear me across the tiny table. Â The waitress was very spotty. We has 2 of their fusion drinks they were pretty good.
