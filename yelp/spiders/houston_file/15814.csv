JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The black tonkotsu with fresh garlic on the side had these thick noodles and succulent broth that left me wanting more. The soup base was a little fatty so if that isnt your thing check out their chicken ramen instead which I heard from my coworker was incredible as well. They have a heaping amount of toppings like ginger and bamboo shoots but what impressed me was how tender the chasu pork was. The only bummer was that they're only a few pieces of meat. Â
