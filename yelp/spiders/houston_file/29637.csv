The Pit Room////The brisket was cut medium thickness and was from lean to semi moist.  The meat was cooked perfectly where it had a nice peppery crust with some fat on it to give it flavor.  It was truly amazing.  The pork ribs were big and had the same peppery flavor.  Very excellent where the meat was not too soft. Kudos to the pit master !
