Kata Robata////The sushi special was quickly followed up by a combo Ocean Picante Roll and a Houston Roll. Both were tasty, but didn't rise to the level of the sushi special. I would rank the Ocean Picante about the Houston Roll. All the sushi, however, was incredibly fresh. I was also happy to note that Kata Robata was not serving Uni (sea urchin) because they had switched suppliers due to the other supplier's proximity to the nuclear disaster in Japan.
