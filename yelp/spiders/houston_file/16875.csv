JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm so glad to find JINYA Ramen Bar in midtown. There is a free parking garage available in the building, after parking your car just take exit to Louisiana St. Their ramens were way above our expectations. As a wonton lover I have to say that Chicken Wonton Ramen is the best ramen so far I had. Certainly fresh ingredients, seaweed salad was perfect combination. Their waiters are very friendly, I will visit JINYA Ramen Bar again, if I ever come back to Houston.
