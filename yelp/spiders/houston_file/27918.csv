The Pit Room////Wow, AWESOME bbq!  If you are a meat eater than you've got to stop by.  They've got Texas Red Chili and frito pies.  They have ribs, brisket, chicken and jalapeño sausage.  Sides are potato salad, slaw and this awesome sautéed okra that is out of this world!  The brisket is lean and delicious and so tender!
