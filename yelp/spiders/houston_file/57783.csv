Kata Robata////This restaurant has such good reviews but our experience there was just bad. We came in on Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty empty. The hostess was very polite and asked us to wait for a table which was fine since we didn't have a reservation. We got a couple of drinks at the bar which were pretty good and bartenders were very helpful and friendly. And that's where 'goodness' stops. We were seated and waited for about 40 min, no one came to greet us so we asked hostess to send us a server. When lady finally showed up she seemed irritated and was straight forward rude. We asked for recommendations she said that descriptions of items were self explanatory. I'm sorry but I don't know the names of ingredients they use and google each one of them is not something I'd like to do on a date night. Her attitude made me think that she had a problem with us specifically because table next to us got all the attention from her. She never came back check on us. The service we got was just horrible.
