Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is worth the wait on weekends. The Green Eggs is as good as it gets. If you like Spinach Artichoke dip, you'll love the Green Eggs. Full of creamy, cheesy, buttery, eggy goodness. I always have a tough time branching out to order other stuff because I love them so much.
