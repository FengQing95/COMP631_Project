JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The good stuff: the food was amazing! Fried and sauces shrimp for appetizer and then we both got ramen bowls. Everything was so flavorful and just seemed like the chef had made it a thousand times and new the exact portions. I definitely will be going back and wish we had one here in dallas!
