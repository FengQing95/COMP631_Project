Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Funny story, I bought my mom a bag of coffee beans as a part of her birthday gift and I didn't pay attention to the price the person at the register said before she swiped my card. I was a fool for that. Later when this transaction showed up on my bank statement, I freaked out because my meal was close to $200. When I called them like, "Yooo why was my food so much?" I discovered that their bag of coffee beans is $125!!!!!!! WOW. I wasn't even mad about it because it was of course my fault for not paying attention but mannnn, be careful that the pretty packaging doesn't distract you as you wait in line.
