Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here was Feb 10. We met family to celebrate a birthday and it was a great experience! Our server Jeremy was EXCELLENT!! He recommended items and was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped make our first time here a great one!! The food is great, drinks are tasty, and service is EXCELLENT! Can't wait to go back!
