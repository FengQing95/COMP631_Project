Kata Robata////First time coming here the other night and I can't complain. This is also coming from someone who isn't a huge fan of sushi due to prior experiences. Everything was presented beautifully, the menu had so many amazing options. The beef skewer was absolutely amazing- I've never had beef that literally melted in my mouth. Honestly I may go back for a night snack for the beef alone it was that good. Sushi redeemed my faith in...well...sushi. Sampled a lot of different fish and couldn't really complain. To top it off, their award winning dessert -which was some ice cream matcha dish with truffles -was such an interesting and satisfying symphony of the taste buds. Great service also. Really cozy atmosphere, music pretty loud, but not in a way that I felt was intrusive. But if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, I would be aware. Self and valet parking available. Dining and non dining bar there as well.
