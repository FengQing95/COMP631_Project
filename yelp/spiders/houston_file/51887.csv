Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////When we went back for a friend's birthday, we weren't like "Oh, this is something I have to order again." I actually had a piece of a friend's pancake the second time around, and I thought it was pretty good. Light and fluffy, as all pancakes should be. However, with my sweet potato hash. the eggs were slightly cold, but well-seasoned. Cheese on sweet potatoes is an innovation that you would never have previously imagined; it was... interesting. Atmosphere was vibrant and buzzing. The wait is horrendous; the parking is atrocious. I suggest you get there early, or have a sacrificial friend wait ahead of time there. We had time to head to the Walgreens across the street to purchase snacks while waiting.
