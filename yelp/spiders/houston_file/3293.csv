JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The atmosphere is pretty casual, the lighting is a little darker than to my liking but it did not hinder me from having a great experience. They open late (until 2am) so I am assuming at night time, it gets a bit more lively. They also have a bar in the front of the restaurant.
