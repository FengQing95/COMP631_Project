Kata Robata////Chef Hori is an artist.  We sat at the sushi bar and Chef Hori was working in front of us for the duration of our 2-hour dinner.  We chatted a bit, he was very personable, and he asked us a few times how we were enjoying the dinner.  The hostess when making reservations and the waiter at the start did ask us about any food allergies/dislikes.
