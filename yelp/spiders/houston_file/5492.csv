JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is a SF chain and they have a good variety of different broths (including chicken - rare for ramen), different noodles, and even rice dishes.  I've tried the Tonkostu black and a spicy miso one they had on special.  Both were delicious and not too salty.  I personally like the thicker, chewier noodles, but they also have thinner noodles.  I have not yet tried the brussel sprout tempura but I am intrigued and looking forward to trying them when I go back!
