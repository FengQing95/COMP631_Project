Uchi////So I go to sushi places from time to time, but I have to admit, that I have never been to Uchi in Houston. It's the most upscale sushi place I have ever been to. I sat at their wine bar as I decided to dine alone. The venue is low lit and personable. The light only shines bright on where they present the dishes. It's all about presentation and flavor here. When you order sake, they present it to you in a wooden box because the wood helps extract the true potential of the sake flavor. The food is often laid to rest on wooden boards. The bartender was so thorough and offered excellent company with her ability to engage in open dialogue. They have several different menus you can choose from with an array of flavors. Pictured is:
