Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////what was weak were the menu offerings. i personally had a sandwich and it was delicious, but other folks at the table had the egg dish that was small in portion and overall, there weren't a lot of menu options, not that i'm looking for the variety of say....chili's......but maybe just a few more options.
