Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not one that thinks the customer is always right, but I left that day with such a bad taste in my mouth in addition to a hole in my wallet that I probably won't return. I felt like I was in high school again and some mean girl was talking SH behind my back. Except this was right in front of my face. If you want customers to return and pay high dollar for pastries, that's not the way to treat them. If I were to order food and sit down and eat there, I would have tipped but to be rude about it in front of me was unnecessary.
