Kata Robata////First time but I won't return. Not impress. For the price we paid I was waiting for a big plate and feeling full. We are leaving to eat somewhere else after spending over $50 on only food. We ate at the bar, service was horrible. She was so dry and rude. Didn't talk, didn't ask if we needed a menu. We clearly sat at bar and waited for her to give us menu for couple of minutes, she never did so we asked for one. Will never return to a place where I pay so much for a shity service.
