Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Perfect was the presentation and taste of their Benny Duo: 1) Bella! Bella! Benny: sliced cooked prosciutto, Taleggio cheese, runny poached cage farm eggs, delicious cream cheese hollandaise, drizzle of balsamic glaze and arugula at the side; and, 2) Chili Verde Benny:  fantastic pulled pork over stack of green chile sauced tortillas which felt like a tamale, intriguing green chili hollandaise, with a mild pico de gallo!  A wonderful combination!
