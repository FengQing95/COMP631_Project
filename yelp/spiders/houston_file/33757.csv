Local Foods////I went earlier today for lunch with my friends and it was my first time there. I enjoyed the atmosphere and that some of the food is sourced locally hence the name. I had the smoked salmon bagel and it was delicious. Both sides I got were cold and part of me wished they were warm but I am not holding that against them. I hope to come here again and try the food throughout the seasons when it changes.
