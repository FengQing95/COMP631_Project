Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place used to be amazing. Noticed that since Common Bond changed ownership (I think a few yrs ago) the quality of the bakery items has dramatically shifted to very "common" quality. Made the mistake of trying out the panettone and it was dry and will now be making french toast out of it. never again. best bakery in town "la Sicilia about a mile down the road. Best cookie value is local foods.
