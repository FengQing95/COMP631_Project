JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you, Jessica, for the great review. We're always very pleased to hear that our ramen is comparable to the ramen that guests have tried in Japan. We can't really ask for greater praise than that. Also, not sure if you know that there is free parking in the garage on Elgin Street between Milam and Louisiana. The bottom floor has free valet service, as well. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
