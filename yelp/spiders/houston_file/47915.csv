Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great place for brunch! It's gonna be packed no matter what time you go on the weekend. So grab a few mimosas and place the games outside! I had the pancakes and French toast they were delicious. Especially after playing a few games of corn toss and be a bit sauced ! Great atmosphere!
