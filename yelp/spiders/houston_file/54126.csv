Kata Robata////Our waitress was nice but the service was EXTREMELY slow. It took me 20 minutes to get my sashimi. What else do you do besides cut the fish and place it on some rice? My friend ordered one roll which was good but it literally took 45 minutes for it to come out. This why I give them 3 stars instead of 4. I had mostly 10 pieces of sashimi including salmon, octopus, uni, salmon roe, and spicy chopped scallops. Everything was very fresh including the uni which was amazing. The octopus was a generous serving. The salmon roe was on the saltier side for me. I don't tend to like super salty food so I probably won't order that again.
