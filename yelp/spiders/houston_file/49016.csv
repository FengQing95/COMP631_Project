Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is one of those places that it's soo good that it's always packed so driving by it a couple of times I was deterred to attempt to wait in their line for a table. Â After talking to a couple of locals who strongly encouraged Snooze, I decided to give them a shot and man was I glad I did.
