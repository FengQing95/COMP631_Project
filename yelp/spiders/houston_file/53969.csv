Kata Robata////I had been to a few work lunches at Kata Robata and wasn't too impressed by their sushi selection. So when my husband suggested we go there for our anniversary dinner, I wasn't that excited even though this place has gotten great reviews. This was my first time eating dinner here and it turned out to be a fabulous experience. The decor and ambience are not that amazing but the food and service more than make up for it. We decided to share some plates. We ordered the 72 hour Kobe beef skewer, scallops, lobster Mac n cheese and one sunrise roll. Every dish was beyond our expectations. The Kobe beef was probably the best meat I had ever eaten. It literally melted in my mouth so I didn't even have to chew it. The scallops were buttery and delicious. The Mac n cheese was so indulgently creamy and the lobster pieces succulent. And the sunshine roll was clean and light, the perfect antidote to the Mac n cheese. My husband is not overly enthusiastic about food but even he couldn't stop raving about the food. Even though this place is in the same strip as Dessert Gallery, do not hop over there. This place has the most amazing desserts too. We got the warm blueberry cake with earl grey ice cream. An amazing combination. When we made our reservation we noted it was our anniversary and the staff brought the dessert for free! It was an elegant and delicious meal at a fancy restaurant but the bill did not break the bank. Normally our bill is around $110-$130 before tip at other upper Kirby fancy restaurants and we have a mountain of food left over. Here, we managed to clean our plates and our bill was under $100. Highly recommend this place!
