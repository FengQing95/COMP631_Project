Uchi////We were seated right away when we came back the following day, the staff are pleasant and our server was very helpful. We tried about 12 sample plates including the dessert and they were all delicious. Their happy hour prices for drinks are also very reasonable. We enjoyed our meal and the experience came along with it!
