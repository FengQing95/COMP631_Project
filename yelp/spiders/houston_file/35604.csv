Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Best place hands down for late night eats and drinks - especially when working late and need to blow off some steam and just enjoy the atmosphere- they even have salads to pretend you're healthy, lol ! I came here a second time after travel for work and not many places open after 10 pm in vicinity and this time around I was pleasantly surprised with everything - Good food and good booze - and btw Jose rocks!! Â - request him as your server - very attentive, sweet and knows how to go above and beyond to service your needs! Great place all around
