Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now, I'm team French toast when you ask me to choose between it and pancakes. But my intelligent dining senses were tingling when I saw "pancake pancake pancake" all over the menu but practically no advertising for their French toast option. I'd rather have a great pancake from a place that specializes in pancakes than average French toast, so my friend and I decided to go halfsies and split the toast with a flight of pancakes along with a side of hash browns.
