JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you are a vegetarian, avoid this place. The broth is extremely underwhelming and the flavors are non existent. The add on that comes with it do not absorb flavors and nothing fixes the flavor. Stay away from this place! Extremely overrated place. Buy a 99c instant ramen than eat this junk.
