Kata Robata////As I do with every sushi restaurant that I'm unfamiliar with, I usually will order a Chirashi bowl. Theirs was pack in a cute little stackable tray/box type container and had a good amount of fish. However, the Tuna that was included was not fresh at all. It tasted so bad I didn't even finish it. The rest of the fish was just alright. Nothing tasted super fresh to me. Ordered the scallop + foie gras nigiri which was pretty tasty. Boyfriend has the spicy soy ramen and I tried a little bit of it and it was just alright. I did only try the broth though so maybe I'll need to come back and try it as a whole to get a better picture.
