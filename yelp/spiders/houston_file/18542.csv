Uchi////Uchi delivers every time. There are very few dishes that can be ranked below 3 stars. Most of those 3s are a matter of personal preference as opposed to chef's execution. We go there every three weeks or so. I've been to all locations ( Houston, Austin, Uchiko) and all locations are equally spectacular. The atmosphere is somewhat casual, somewhat fancy. But you set your own tone. Maguro- what a treat. Yokai berry, P-38/zero sen, hama chili. And many more favorites.
