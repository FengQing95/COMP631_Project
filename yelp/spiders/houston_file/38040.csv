Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We have gone here for brunch, steak night and just to sit at the bar for a drink. Place has a great vibe food is great and love taking people here when they come in and visit from out of town. I give it 4 stars just because a few times the host was not so welcoming. Other than that definitely check it out.
