JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came in after work and was seated immediately for the first time!! My server KevinL was the nicest. As usually the appetizer came out very fast I had edamame and salmon poke taco. The taco was amazing!! I love samon it was surprisingly fresh I just wish it was a bit cheaper bc it was 2 baby tacos for like 6$ for ramen we had the kar-men for the first time. I really enjoyed it, it was really spicy and it reminded me of like pho bc it had cilantro and bean sprouts. But my all time fav would bc the wonton chicken ramen 5/5 service 5/5 for quality
