Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I heard a lot about this place and couldn't wait to try it. Parking was packed but we found a spot and quickly put our name on the wait list. Waited 20 minutes and was seated . The first mishap was trying to order a soft drink and being told their carbonation wasn't working - therefore no soft drinks available. We ordered two breakfast entrees and toast to start off with. The toast took 25 minutes to come out to our table. When my breakfast pot pie arrived the eggs were cooked wrong (I ordered scrambled and it came out fried). Overall service was lengthy, my order was wrong, the food wasn't outstanding. However - the manager did make it right and comped our entire meal so that took this from 2 stars to 3 stars.
