JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty good ramen. Not spectacular but worth eating again. I wish the broth was warmer. I like mine really hot to the point where it feels like it's burning my tongue lol. I also had to add ramen sauce and spice to give it a little more flavor. Nice ambiance. They provide high chairs for kids. Small and busy restaurant so expect a wait.
