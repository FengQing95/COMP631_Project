Baby Barnaby's////We ordered a waffle with bananas and pecans, a side of bacon (mine!), huevos rancheros, and a big bowl of fresh fruit.  Our stay in Houston was 5.5 days, and at the end of it, Wifey was alarmed at the lack of fresh fruits and vegetables available on restaurant menus here.  So to get fresh fruit, freshly made huevos rancheros, non-greasy fried potatoes on the side, AND bottomless fresh squeezed OJ? Homegirl was soooo relieved.  Service was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is chill and laid back.
