Baby Barnaby's////My girlfriend and I recently stopped by this neat, little breakfast spot after a weekend long run. Apparently, we weren't the only runners who wanted some better-than-IHOP breakfast food because there were a lot of other people clothed in sweatshirts, running shorts, and running shoes waiting outside on this chilly morning.
