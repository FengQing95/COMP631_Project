JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the sprouting up bowl of ramen and I always thought they never gave enough meat but this time my piece of meat was all fat.  My husband got the vegetable soup ramen and it came with just half the soup.  We told the waitress and she said she had to call the manager over because they usually charge for more soup.  We didn't want to make a big deal of it and just told the waitress to charge us for it.  She brought out a big bowl of broth but it just doesn't make sense to charge for extra soup when the bowl clearly didn't come with enough broth.   A little disappointed with tonight's dinner,  probably won't be coming back for a while.
