Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food here is great; HOWEVER, our service was terrible! I came here with a friend who was visiting from out of town. When we arrived, we were told the wait was 45 minutes and we would be texted when our table was ready. I'm totally fine with waiting, but I would rather a restaurant overestimate that time than double it. After an hour I approached the hostess stand and asked when we would be seated since we were quoted 45 minutes. She said we were next on the list, and that's the same time we received our text saying they were ready to seat us. We then watched the hostess walk all the way around the restaurant talking to coworkers and goofing off, only to come back and fill up her personal coffee cup and take time mixing sugar in it. She then checked her phone and had her back to the line waiting out the door. This took fifteen minutes, and of course we were getting impatient. She finally turned around and sat four more couples who complained about the wait, and was beginning to seat a fifth, when I approached her and asked why we were not seated 20 minutes ago when we were told we were next. This is after we had watched her drag other customer's names above ours on the iPad application the seaters were using.
