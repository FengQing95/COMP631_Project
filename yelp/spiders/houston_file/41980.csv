Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great place for pastries and cookies with a light, airy, hipster vibe. Their chocolate chip cookies are solid. Their chai latte is decent, but if you're more into the whole milk with ginger and less sugar true yoga retreat kind of chai, this isn't the place for that. Overall, really enjoyed the ambiance!
