Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We were so excited to try this place, but we left a bit disappointed. The old fashioneds tasted like flavored water. If you're going to advertise as a whisky bar, the drinks should not disappoint. The fries... why mess up a good thing? The Brussels sprouts... again, sometimes less is more. The bourbon chicken was tender but tasted like it had been soaked in bbq sauce and bourbon. No depth to the flavor at all. The brick chicken had a lot of flavor but the rice was a bit too spicy to enjoy. Overall the ambience was loud and chaotic. We wanted to love this place. And we expected to love it. Sadly, I'm not sure we'll return. Maybe we hit them on an off night. It happens. And it seems others have been pleased with the service and drinks so... I'm willing to give them another try. I don't like posting negative reviews but I can't whole heartedly recommend this as a surefire hit. The positive was we had no wait and the food came quickly. The hostess/manager were kind and they were practicing social distancing and masks. So that's a win.
