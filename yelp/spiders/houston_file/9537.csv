JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went in a group of 6. If your group is more than 4 people, you'll be seated at one of the two community tables (shared with other parties). We got there around 6:50pm on a Tuesday and were seated right away -- we beat the 7:00-7:15pm rush of multiple parties coming in.
