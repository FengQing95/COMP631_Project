Uchi////Uchi holds their food standards high and server service at par with it but it just wasn't happening with us that night.  It's unfortunate that the it had to be on my birthday evening.  It's a great place to dine with a date but definitely never again will I come here with a group again.  It was just horrible that I had to turn away friends that drove from Dallas to come celebrate with me just because of the unaccommodating attitude of Reservation Queen.
