Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place!! I was anxiously anticipating the relocating of these 3 chefs to Houston for *months* and they have more than exceeded my expectations. It's a beautiful place filled wit even more beautiful food, and they brew Houston's own Boomtown Coffee (my second favorite behind Katzs). I think the prices are completely affordable for the quality of what you get and even with that are not expensive. Staff are very attentive and friendly, and the other patrons so far have been very easy to sit with in such a tight place.
