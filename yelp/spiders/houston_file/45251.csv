Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lavender Latte - really unique latte that I was not sure I would like, given that I wasn't sure how lavender and espresso paired together. It turns out that they mesh just fine, and the floral undertones of the lavender helps counter out some of the bitterness of the espresso. The vanilla latte is fantastic, also, if you're in the mood for something more traditional.
