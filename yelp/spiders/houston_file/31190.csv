Local Foods////I've been back a few times since it's close to my office. Yet to have anything bad. The truffle egg salad is legit, the pretzel bun makes the sandwhich. However, I think my favorite right now , as Cameron B. mentioned, is the chicken sandwhich. It's not deep fried, but breaded with nuts? I think. I don't know, but it's so good. The bahn mi was okay, but I probably wouldn't get it again because there's better things on the menu. I've had several of the sides and nothing really sticks out for me other than the potato salad, it's slightly spicy and just so good. I really should just start getting double potato salad for my sides. They also have different fresh baked goods. The cupcakes were $2 and bigger and better than a place down the street that charges $3.25 :)
