Local Foods////The Duck Confit was fantastic, but I think I would ask for light or no aioli next time. When I would hit a pocket of the fatty emulsion, the feeling and taste of the sandwich would venture into the realm of too rich. I liked the actual duck in the dish. Duck (especially duck confit) can often be greasy. The duck was moist without the excess oil deposits. From time to time an almost liver-y, gamey-ness of the duck overpowered the balanced nature of the sandwich, but I actually love that flavor. It didn't bother me, but my compatriots were slightly put off by it.
