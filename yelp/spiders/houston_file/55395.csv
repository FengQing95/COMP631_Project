Kata Robata////We ordered quite a few dishes from the happy hour menu to share. My personal favorites were the Spicy Salmon Roll, Kobe Beef Tacos, Tropical Spicy Tuna Roll, and this chicken dish that included kimchi powder and grits (forgot the name). The dishes were fresh, very well presented, and pretty filling. For my drink, I ordered a glass of red wine off the happy hour menu, and while it wasn't too bad, it wasn't my favorite. They also didn't specify on the menu what kind of red it was.
