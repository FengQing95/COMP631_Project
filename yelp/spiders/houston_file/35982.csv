Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had trouble finding food we liked.  Everything had a unique touch, which many probably like. However, there was not a go to, simple item. So 2 in our group did not like it which will prevent a return.  We were luke warm on appetizers with no one liking the pimento cheese and only medium response to other two.
