JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen. Tonkatsu black is a punch of flavors. Tonkatsu white is lighter in mouth-feel and comes with a little dollop of pepper paste for an extra kick. The Tonkatsu assari was my least favorite, but still good. I always get extra garlic with my ramen because I'm a garlic +salt fiend. You should try pressing some fresh garlic in your bowl sometime. It's tasty tasty.
