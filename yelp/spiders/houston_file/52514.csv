Kata Robata////Round 2 at Kata Robata...food still awesome so I am not going to take a star away from my rating, but I felt the need to make mention of the AWFUL and rude service I experienced this evening!  Our server rushed us on everything, was very short with us and condescending.  My friend and I had no idea how to react other than laugh after he walked away because we could not believe the way he was treating us.  Maybe he was new or just having an "off" night, but this guy really turned me off.  I would go back because it is some of the best sushi I have had, but I will be sure to steer clear of this server!
