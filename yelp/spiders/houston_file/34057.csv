Local Foods////Before you gripe about a $10+ sandwich, lemme tell you these servings are BIG. Especially if you ask them for a pretzel bun!! Thick, pretzel bunny buns that serve as the perfect vessel for the nutty crunchy chicken on the inside. The chicken was moist and flavorful, to my surprise, and although the couscous wasn't anything too noteworthy I enjoyed the Asian-influenced cabbage slaw with miso/sesame oil dressing and edamame beans.
