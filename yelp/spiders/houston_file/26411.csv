The Pit Room////Ok so I'm not a BBQ aficionado. Like I just k ow what I like. So to my understanding ribs are suppose to be fall off the bone right??? And juicy??? Well anyways he got the 3 meat platter : brisket, sausage, and ribs. Two sides beans and potato salad. I just got one pulled pork taco and a side of mac and cheese. Ok well the place is really nice. The decor and the cute benches. Everything is really well lit. The staff is was nice. So all that I give 5 stars.
