Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here several times with different people and we have always enjoyed our food and drink. The pastries are delicious and visually appealing, the main dishes are always amazing and the staff is friendly and helpful. I can't say enough good things. It is almost always super busy- because it is that good. Be prepared to wait in line for a few minutes to order, but I definitely think that the wait is worth it. Well done Common Bond, you are a Houston staple.
