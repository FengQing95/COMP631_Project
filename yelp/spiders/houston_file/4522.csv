JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time here and have heard great reviews.. Ordered our food to go.  We ordered the Tonkotsu Assari, Tonkotsu spicy and the cha cha cha.  The broth and noodles boxed separately which was great so our noodles wouldn't get soggy.  Ordered extra sides- the spicy bean sprouts and the nori dried seaweed.  I liked how the labeled which broth was which.  The Tonoktsu spicy and the cha cha cha was delicious.  My son wasn't a fan of the Assari. Overall loved everything and looking forward to dining in and trying some different dishes!!
