Uchi////I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers - phenomenal!  I LOVE sushi and this was by far the BEST dining experience I've ever had.  The service was on point as everyone was friendly and attentive.  We had plenty of questions about the menu but our server was knowledgeable and even offered some yummy suggestions that we probably normally would not have tried (yokai berry).  Each dish came with a  thorough explanation which was nice because by the time you are done savoring your first bite, your next mouthwatering dish arrives just in time!  The beer and wine menu is not short of selections.  I don't normally get dessert but we tried the fried milk and it was heavenly.
