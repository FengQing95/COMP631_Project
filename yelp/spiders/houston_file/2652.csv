JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachel - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, which does hit the spot when it's cold out. Regarding parking -- did you know there's a free parking garage located right around the corner on Elgin between Louisiana and Milam? The first floor has free valet parking. As far as the future of JINYA is concerned, who knows what will happen. All I know is that we work very hard everyday and are extremely grateful for everyone who dines with us.
