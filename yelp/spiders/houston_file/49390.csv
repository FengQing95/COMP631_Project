Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm not a breakfast person but this was the best breakfast I've ever had. I got the potato spuds. You can add two fillings plus eggs. I didn't want the eggs so I got two additional fillings. I added spinach, roasted garlic, caramelized onions and red peppers. I also added poblano hollandaise sauce. It was so good. My friend got the same except with caramelized onions, bacon and eggs.
