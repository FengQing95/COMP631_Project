Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The staff was really friendly and helpful. Answered our questions, offered suggestions. They were willing to make us lunch even though we arrived right at 3. Provided my husband a sample of an item he'd never tried before he ordered a full sandwich. Latte was perfect. Brioche was the best I've ever had. Heads up: they were sold out of many pastries, so my choices were somewhat limited. I was told that they sell out of the most popular items by about 1 (only reason for 4 stars, not 5). Looking forward to returning soon.
