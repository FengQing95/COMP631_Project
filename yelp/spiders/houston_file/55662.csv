Kata Robata////Kata Robata is the best Japanese restaurant in Houston! I love the hot dishes as much as the sushi and signature rolls. My favorite starter is the Japanese Amberjack Sashimi with Foie Gras. Their seaweed salad is so unique and fresh. More importantly, they have such a huge selection of fresh fish! This place is always packed so make sure you make a reservation before!
