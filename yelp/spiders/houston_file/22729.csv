Uchi////I had the chef's selection for five pieces, which for $18 is more than reasonable. The flounder that we had was absolutely amazing. There were some bits of a rock salt or something that complemented the fish and the vinegar bite from the sushi rice just that bit more without overpowering any of the other pieces.
