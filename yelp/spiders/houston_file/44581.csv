Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Such a great brunch spot!. Had the cream puff and shrimp and grits for brunch. Make sure you get a coffee, lavender latte is a must try! Serving size is very large,enough to share for two people. If you get there early not a long wait at all. So much to choose from In regards to baked goods. Be sure Â to grab a treat for later! Delish!
