Local Foods////The Gulf Shrimp and Blue Crab Sandwich on ciabatta bread, which I'd previously reviewed as a light and flavorful concoction, is still near and dear to my heart. And, with the combination of ever-changing side dishes ranging from quinoa, cous cous, kale or beet salads, to housemade chips, Local Foods presents a refreshing take on the sandwich shop. I'm so glad it's found its place.
