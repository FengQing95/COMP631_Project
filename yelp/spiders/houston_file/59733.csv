Baby Barnaby's////*While they are very accommodating, I will say that my recent trip here - I was caught rather off guard. They have done a lot of improvements on the "waiting patio" to keep it shaded & cooler. Yay, thank you for that! However as a storm rolled in, and rain came in sideways they don't have any drop down/roll down protection! They had to move slightly damp patrons inside... taking up some tables that would have been for guests on the waiting list. It is Houston, and crazy rain is known to happen - so be aware of this when you are deciding where to sit... At least until they add some rain shields!*
