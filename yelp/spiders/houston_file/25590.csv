Uchi////13. Fried Milk Dessert - The last course was dessert. The fried milk was unique and delicious! It consists of three fried milk balls that are warm and burst milky liquid into your mouth when you take a bite, with crisp fudge crisps, creamy vanilla ice cream, and delicious pieces of what tastes like a type of graham cracker. I wish they gave more fried milk balls in this one.
