Baby Barnaby's////Attention all breakfast lovers you are about to get you breakfast socks knocked off! I ordered the breakfast plate with coffee- warm, delicious, and my tastes buds danced. The place is small and comfortable. I don't recommend coming here in a big group. Also, if you you plan on soaking up the sun then come on a weekend because weekdays they only serve inside.
