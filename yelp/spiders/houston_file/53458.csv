Kata Robata////For New Year's, they offered an oyster flight: an oyster trio where one is topped with grapefruit salsa, another is topped with cucumber puree, and the last is topped with uni. I LOVE oysters, and this dish was pretty decent! The flavors were right, and I liked how refreshing it tasted.
