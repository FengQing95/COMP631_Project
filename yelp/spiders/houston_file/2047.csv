JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya changed my mind, the tonkotsu black noodles (num 1) is definitely my fav. I like to eat it with the truffle brussels sprouts, the crunchiness is a great compliment to the chewy, soft, n creamy noodles. The pork that comes with the tonkotsu is the best I've ever had, soft n tender n moist. Try the almond pudding dessert thing, it's amazing!!! It's like a mixture between a creme brulee n panna cotta (my 2 fav desserts) with refreshing fresh fruits on top. My kids loved the soft dumplings, the chicken nuggets wasn't impressive and the squid balls were NOT what we were expecting n only had like 2 TINY TINY piece of squid inside a HUGE ball of smushed potato-deviled-egg-like stuff.. it was weird...
