JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I dined in at about 7 P.M. on a Wednesday and was seated promptly. However, 10 minutes past and my waiter still hadn't come by. I ended having to tell the hostess. After placing my order, Jinya #3 with a tea, another 20 minutes passed and I hadn't even received my drink. I ended up having to tell the hostess again and she ended up bringing my drink instead of my waiter and apologized. The hostess came by to refill my drink and to take my credit card. I appreciated the hostess' efforts but the waiter's service was inexcusable. Some of the worst service I've ever had.
