JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Of all the ramen spots that I visit in Houston, jinya is the one that I always return to. Of the ramens I've tried there: tonkatsu ( rich pork broth ramen), the cha cha cha( garlic lovers special), and the spicy chicken ramen, I've always had a great experience eating them. What really makes jinya a great place to continue to eat at though is actually their Brussel sprout tempura and takoyaki. Every time I go there, I always order these two items and constantly crave them!!
