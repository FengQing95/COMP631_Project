Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had breakfast with a friend here this morning and was really impressed. Typically I go to Starbucks and get a croissant and drip coffee. Just under $6. Today I had a drip coffee and an amazing, beautiful fruit croissant that was baked here for $6.50. I was impressed at how helpful everyone that works here is and how attentive given that you order at the front and they bring out your food and drinks. People came around and asked me if I needed anything, refill, etc.
