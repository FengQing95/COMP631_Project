Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVE THIS PLACE! I've had a variety of items off the menu and I'm always satisfied. Their pancakes are definitely the best in town. Additionally, their servers are always super nice and attentive. The only downside is the wait, at a minimum 30 minutes but more often closer to an hour. Everyone loves this place!
