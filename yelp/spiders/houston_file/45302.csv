Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been to common bond a few times and each time I've been very impressed with the staffs recommendations. There was absolutely no line and plenty of places to sit. Beautiful and delicious desserts but definitely overpriced. I would definitely visit again! Would make a great daytime date spot in Houston!
