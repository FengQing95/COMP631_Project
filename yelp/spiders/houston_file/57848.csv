Kata Robata////Quality, quality, quality. Very special. Sashimi for 2 is always super fresh and offers an amazing selection and value as well. Coin toss with MF sushi for my fav sushi restaurant in houston, but kata offers more 'flexibility' (hours) and a bit better value. Wonderful and attentive wait staff. There is a reason they stay busy all the time and the place well deserves it. Also very glad to see some management changes/improvements. Keep up the good work.
