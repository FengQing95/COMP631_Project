Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Really slow, mediocre service. We came for my friend's 21st birthday celebration which we mentioned but were never offered a dessert menu or recommended any popular drinks. My salmon was tasty, but I wasn't impressed with the cornbread starter. I just found it a bIt overpriced and didn't walk away with the experience I'd hoped for. I'm glad valet was complimentary at least.
