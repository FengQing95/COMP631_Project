Uchi////Over the years, our family has been to Uchi for many life event celebrations and have always received five-star service to go with the superb food.  Last night, my wife and I went to celebrate my 1,000th day of retirement (a big deal!) and experience was once again wonderful.  Anthony was our server and, as usual, we requested omakase paired with a bottle of the lovely Delaport Sancerre.  We were presented with dish after dish that were each delightful, pleasing to the palate and in the perfect alternating rhythm of lighter and richer to create a sense of harmony and balance rather than simply a linear progression.  We signalled Anthony when we were about 70% full, so we finished feeling comfortable and not stuffed.  In talking to Anthony, we learned that his roots are Vietnamese, though he has never been to Vietnam and is planning a trip there next year.  I mentioned that in just a couple of days I would celebrate the 50-year anniversary of my return from Vietnam as a young 20-year old combat infantryman, and had talked about how beautiful the countryside was despite the war, and how important it was for him to visit his ancestral homeland.  To my suprise, when the bill came it reflected a significant discount in recognition of my military service and my status as an Army veteran.  I was humbled and gratified, and a perfect evening for me and my wife was made even better.  We have always been loyal Uchi customers and are even more avidly so now.  Thank you.
