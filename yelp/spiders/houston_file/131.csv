JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very tasty, ramen broth was just right, flavorful but not too salty.  It gets pretty busy but we were lucky and got a seat right at the bar, which also allowed us to put in our order much faster.  Very attentive service as well. Fried chicken pieces were pretty tasty, had some good seasoning.
