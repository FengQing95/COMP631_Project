Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered half Benny, half French Toast! I love that they allow that, but it's not on the menu, I just asked and he said yes! So I ordered the Late Harvest Benny and the French Toast Neat, but they kept bringing me the Drunken Monkey! I mean they finally got it right and took it off my tab, but I would rather have just got the right meal. No biggie, I don't mind a free meal.
