JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I decided to split the Jinya Bun (chasu pork on white bao) with my companion and ordered the Premium Tonkotsu White ramen for myself. The chasu pork from the bun was MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH GOODNESS. As for the ramen, the first sip of the broth was magical. It was perfectly flavored, not too salty. I like that they offer the white (half pork, half chicken broth) for a lighter option! Even so, I still wish I had split the bowl with a friend because I left feeling STUFFED. I can't wait to come back to try their other ramen options!
