Baby Barnaby's////I really like this location. The atmosphere and waitstaff are warm and friendly.  I never get an attitude when asking questions about the menu.  The food is served with care and in large portions.   This visit I ordered a salad with chicken and ate every bite.  Chicken was cooked perfectly and all the veggies were fresh as could be and the honey mustard dressing was so good I could eat it like a soup.
