Uchi////I'm not sure why I never reviewed Uchi when I've been here so many times. I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said already.  They are just simply amazing.  Every piece you bite into is perfectly seasoned and flavored where you shouldn't even need to dip into soy sauce.  Actually, don't deep in soy sauce, you will be stared at. LOL.
