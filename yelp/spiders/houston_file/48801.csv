Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We visited @snoozeameatery upon our arrival to Houston last Friday. We were warned by our Ãœbs about their long lines but promised it was worth the wait. We got lucky and only waited 20 mins...with drinks in hand and even played some games in the meantime outside. The hostess was the sweetest and gorgeous! She explained to us how things worked and suggested we grab a drink while we wait. We feasted brunch style! I had the Sweet Potato Hash with Tuscan Kale two sunny side up eggs, soy chorizo () and a drizzle of Gochujang (red chili paste) Oh! They have a special @bravadospice hot sauce that I can't find if anyone knows where I can find the pineapple one slide in my DMs and I'll love you forever!
