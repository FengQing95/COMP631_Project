Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////FAVORITE: plain ol' croissant-- THIN perfectly flaky crispy layers. Soft, cloud-like layers on the inside. Baked to perfection. LOVED THEM. BEST croissants I've ever had in my life... and i LOVE croissants. They are the size of 2 of my hands laid out side by side. I could stuff my fist into one of them. And I devoured 2 of these babies on site.
