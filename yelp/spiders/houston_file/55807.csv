Kata Robata////The food was fantastic but slightly overpriced. We (my father and I) ordered and shared three things: the Slow Cooked Texas Kobe Beef Robata Skewers, the Sashimi Combo, and the Spicy Soy Ramen. The skewers were the first to come out. I guessed that it would be a small portion, considering the price of $17, but it was actually significantly smaller than I thought it would be. I'd say the amount of beef was about equal to the size of two regular-sized pieces of nigiri (including the fish and the rice). When I tasted it, however, its tenderness and flavor mostly made up for the price. I still believe it was slightly overpriced, but I'd most likely order it again. Next was the sashimi combo. Based on the size of the skewers, i expected it to be smaller, so I was pleasantly surprised by how big it was. For $21 it was smaller than what I would have liked, but the fish was great and the sauces were great so I really can't complain. Finally, I was extremely satisfied with the ramen. There was a LOT of ramen, and even a little bit of it was very filling. It tasted delicious and was only $15. I would absolutely recommend the ramen.
