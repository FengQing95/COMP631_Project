Baby Barnaby's////So I found this place when I googled breakfast near me and it is amazing. My mom ordered the ham steak and eggs which was delicious with sliced tomatoes and avocado. I ordered the pork chop and eggs with potatoes and wheat toast. It was scrumptious. It was juicy & not dry . The eggs were not over cooked & everyone in the environment looked as if they were enjoying their food.
