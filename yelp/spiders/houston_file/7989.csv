JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here on a Saturday afternoon, was realllly busy but my bf and I got in within 20 mins. The customer service was friendly the food itself though was not all that great (I had the Tokyo Yatai ramen) I didn't understand what the hype was all about bc it kinda tasted like mi mama from the package.. the hunt for the best ramen is still on!
