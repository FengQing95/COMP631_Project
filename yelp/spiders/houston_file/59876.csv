Baby Barnaby's////David and I decided to try this place out since it had such great reviews. I was a little worried the wait would be unbearable, especially since our day started out a little late, but we ended up waiting only about 20 minutes...not too bad. It gave us some time to stalk the patrons eating outside, deciding what looked delicious and browse the menu.
