Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Phenomenal food this is my go to Friday morning brunch spot after a night out. Food is always more than delicious. Egg's Benedict is off the charts. The Pancake flight is a no brainer as well. Always ask the waiter what is good, a couple times i have been in between items, and have asked their opinion; it never fails me. Been many many times, and always trying something new, and never not satisfied. This is one of the few places I can say, everything on their menu is good,
