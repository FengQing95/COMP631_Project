Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here with my girlfriend because she cant shut up about the freaking pancakes here, and I can see why she does now. They were actually pretty good but I am not a fan of sweets myself. I am giving four stars because unfortunately our wait time to get seated kept fluctuating so it was a bit much... I liked the omelet I go, hope to try something different when we come back. The breakfast was overall very good and service was too. We will probably try to come back at a less busy time next time we eat here.
