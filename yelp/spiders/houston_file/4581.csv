JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello May - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry your server failed to bring you hot water as you had requested. Since the weather in Houston has turned colder, we have definitely noticed more requests for hot tea and hot water, so I understand how important it must have been for you to receive it with your meal. Besides that incident, were there any other failures in service to mention? Did the server fail you in any other way(s)? I ask because this type of feedback is essential to helping us improve our station. I also agree that his inattention is unacceptable, and I will speak to him about it immediately. If you are willing and able, please private message me with more information about him so that I can carry out that task.
