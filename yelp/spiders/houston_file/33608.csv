Local Foods////Guys, I promise you, I discovered this place about 4 years ago (or more) - this was when all the Sugar Landers stayed in Sugar Land and dined at the local Panera or La Mads, when Houston was unexplored by suburbans, and when there was still only one Local Foods location. Since then, everyone and their mom has found out about it and it's basically the equivalent of Peru as a travel destination. It's cool, just remember I was your loyal patron when there was ample seating space at any and all times.
