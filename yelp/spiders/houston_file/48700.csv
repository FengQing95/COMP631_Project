Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were told a 30-45 minute wait, but it ended up being a 45-60 minute wait; hence the 4-star review. No one likes to wait when hungry, especially THAT Â long. We lucked out on getting a parking spot right in front, but know this was rare luck. Side street parking around the restaurant is more probable.
