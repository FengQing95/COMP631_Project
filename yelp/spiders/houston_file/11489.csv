JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have tried many kinds of ramen here and so far nothing really let me down. I am not bold enough to try the garlic flavor one yet. There is something not ramen like about garlic flavor. I don't ever like thick noodles so I always got think noodles for my order. My favorite is either the tongotsu white or the spicy miso. The black is good too. I have tried the Dan Dan ramen since I know where the real authentic Dan Dan men is and I don't believe it's in a Japanese ramen joint.
