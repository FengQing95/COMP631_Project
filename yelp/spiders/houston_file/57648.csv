Kata Robata////Love this place. Second experience is just as great as my first. The food was on point. Happened to be on vacation and was craving for the bone marrow so we stopped by for lunch and I'm still very impressed. Our service was very informative and attentive. I believe his name was Ngo. My boyfriend and I are very satisfied with today's performance. Thanks guys! Definitely recommend
