JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen place in Houston! The staff is very friendly and the food is so good! I always try to go here whenever my classes gets cancelled cause it's so close to HCC and businesses nearby. I highly suggest the Spicy Chicken for spice lovers or the Cha Cha Ramen for garlic lovers. They're fried chicken and takoyaki is also really good!
