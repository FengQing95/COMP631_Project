Local Foods////After seeing and reading all the advertisements and articles about Local Foods opening, I had to try it out.  I'm a big fan of Benjy's, and I immediately became excited when I heard about their new venture into the deli world. Located right next door to the Benjy's in Rice Village (where the former Antone's was), Local Foods has an industrial and airy (maybe too much space?) feel to it. For a Saturday, it wasn't crowded at all with plenty of tables for lunch service.
