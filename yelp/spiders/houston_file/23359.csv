Uchi////We sat at the wine bar and had incredible service, probably better than if we ate at a table, because he was like our own personal waiter.  Our two MUST ORDER dishes are hama chili (previously mentioned yellowtail over orange), and the hot tastings hamachi nabe (yellowtail, koshi rice, farm egg, soy). There are so many incredible items on the menu that you really can't go wrong!  Just be sure to make a reservation weeks in advance, because it seems near impossible to get one within a few days.  We normally walk in and wait for barstools to open up.  There is also a sushi bar (reservations only), as well as a private room for larger and more intimate parties.
