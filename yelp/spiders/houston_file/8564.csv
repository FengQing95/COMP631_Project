JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The wait wasn't long because I chose to sit at the bar. For an appetizer, I had the Jinya Bun. It was the best bun I've ever had. The meat was delicate, full of flavor, and as soft as the pillow. My friend ordered the takoyaki. This is probably one of the best takoyaki I've ever had. The sauce was to die for.
