JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chastity - Thanks for you review. I'm sorry you found our ramen underwhelming. We're never going to be all things to all people, but we are still grateful you gave us a try, regardless. As far as your server having gone missing for 20 minutes -- that is unacceptable, and I would like your help in identifying your server so that I might have a word with him/her about it. Can you provide me more details in a private message? My only assumption is that sometimes servers choose not to interrupt customers if they're in deep conversation, or if the house isn't very busy and the customers appear to be "hanging out," as it were. But if neither of those scenarios was the case, like I said, I'd like to speak to the server to make sure it doesn't happen again. Thanks again.
