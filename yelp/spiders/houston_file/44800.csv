Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In terms of pastries, the croissants are definitely the star for me. Common Bond manages to make them look fragile yet structured (if that makes sense)--they're baked a bold golden brown color and are giant proportions. Yet when you slice into one, it crackles easily and the inside is actually quite hollow. There are layers of crispy shell encasing the fluffier, lighter layers. I prefer the pain au chocolat over the almond croissant, but there needs to be more filling in general. Some chocolate was tucked into my croissant, but not enough to be satisfied. I'd say it was about 30% chocolate.
