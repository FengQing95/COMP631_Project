Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You will love their food but the wait is something serious! Favorite Breakfast restaurant their bar drinks are scrumptous and their pancakes are HUGE and FLAVORFUL! You can customize everything on the menu. I'm vegetarian and did receive some meat in my food but they remade in a seperate pan with no problem! A customer for life....
