Local Foods////Today, I have graduated and work in the energy industry like everyone else in Houston. About a year ago I was put in charge of ordering catering a few times a month for client presentations. Local has been my exclusive caterer since then. Jan has saved me several times now when I needed catering for Monday and forgot to place the order on Friday-- they still process my order on the weekends and it is always done right. The best part: Clients love the food we bring. Most sandwich lunches that are catered come from a Deli that rhymes with Mason's. Local Foods blows those guys out of the water, it is not even close.
