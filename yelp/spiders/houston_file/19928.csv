Uchi////We finally manage to make a reservation on Monday night at Uchi. They live up to the hype and we had a wonderful experience. Walu walu is a bit overcooked but when you scooped the broth and eat it, then it offset the dryness of the fish. Avo bake was not that great, don't order it. Crispy Brussels sprout with lime chili. If you have not tasted Brussels sprout or dislike it before, then this will change your mind. We can't stop nibble on them. We tried one of their daily special menu which is eggplant maki, it was good especially the sambal olek dressing.
