The Pit Room////Wanted to try some good Texas barbecue so we had lunch at "The Pit" last week in Houston. We ordered the family platter to split which feeds 4 to 6, and it was awesome. I'm not sure I had had a beef rib this large or good. Brisket was good, I really liked the sausage too. We ate outside, it was a little cool but still nice. Great barbecue, great vibe, will definitely come back. Highly recommended!
