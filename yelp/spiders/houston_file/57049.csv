Kata Robata////My sister and I made a reservation for 5pm on a Saturday, and we're really glad we did because the place filled up fast that there were people lined up at the door during our meal. So... MAKE A RESERVATION! It also might be better to call instead of going through the online system, as I was able to get a time slot that wasn't listed on the website by calling. They also have happy hour deals (5-6:30 Mon-Sat, 12-5 Sun), which includes discounts on some appetizers, rolls, and sake.
