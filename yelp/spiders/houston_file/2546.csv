JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's great to know that management does care and has taken the time to respond. I'm sure it was human error as stated, but I felt that I had to voice my opinion about the uneasy experience I had last. We are regulars at Jinya and will continue to support businesses like this that provides good quality food. I usually don't like to speak up about unfair treatments and tend to just walk away from bad experiences, but Jinya is a place we enjoy and I really don't want to put it on my no-go list.
