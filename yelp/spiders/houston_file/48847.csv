Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Good: Food selection is exciting and tasty! Lots of exciting breakfast items to choose from beyond bacon and eggs. Dessert pancakes and Cocktails. Cool vibe. Friendly staff. Great spot for a low key/hangover breakfast with loved ones. Our food took forever to come out and they gave us a pecan cinnamon bun to nibble on that was extra-ordinary.
