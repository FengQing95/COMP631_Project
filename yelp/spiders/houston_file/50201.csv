Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My go-to dish would have to be the Benny Goodman. Sweet Lord praise. It is just heaven on earth with an explosion of flavor of the salmon, eggs, hollandaise and hints of that sun-dried tomato and capers. With a side of crunchy and not too salty hash browns, this dish is lit. You can even go the extra mile and pair it with a mimosa to be extra basic; you do you. I've also tried the Bella! Bella! Benny, which was good, a little on the salty side to my tastes, but good nonetheless. If you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, try the French Toast Neat! Simple but to the point.
