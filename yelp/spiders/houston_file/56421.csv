Kata Robata////The salmon/soft shell crab is pretty self-explanatory and tasty, but my preferred roll was the longhorn roll. Aside from having the namesake of the mascot of the best university, the longhorn roll was stuffed with fried shrimp and topped with avocado and caviar. Total indulgence for me!
