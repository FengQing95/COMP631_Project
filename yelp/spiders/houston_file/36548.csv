Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The bosscat burger chef's way, which our waitress stated was the best burger ever, was pretty alright. Mine came out cold, so, hard to get excited about that. My husband said his was average ("it's a burger, so it's hard to mess that up"). Our other friend had ordered it too, and he ended up eating half of it as served then just eating the burger patty by itself. The waitress came by and made a comment on how he had eaten the burger, and I'm like wtf lady that's weird of you. Sorry, did we need the chef's permission on the right way to eat it too?
