Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were looking for a place we've never been to before to try breakfast at in our neighborhood and we came across Common Bond Cafe & Bakery. It's such a cute spot. With an array of pastries to choose from, as well as different coffee drinks, there's also a full food menu. I wanted to be on the "safe" side and chose something that I knew wouldn't fail me and that was the French toast. Let me to tell, it was so good!!! They use challah bread, which is my favorite for French toast, it's served with some amazing tasting strawberries and bacon. I was pleased with my entire meal. They also have mimosas, which we had a carafe of mango mimosas. Definitely no complaints there lol! Â Because who doesn't love mimosas!
