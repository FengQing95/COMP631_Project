Uchi////The service was outstanding. I did not mind the many waiters everyone was very attentive and informed. There was no wait for our table and the food was served quickly. This restaurant was pricy so I would try dishes I couldn't find anywhere else. Â Stick with the daily specials. There are so many good sushi restaurants in Houston this one is an experience. However I would not wait in line. It is noisy and very trendy.
