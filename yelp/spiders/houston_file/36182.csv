Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here, but definitely not the last. Came for restaurant week for a GNO. Got the Kentucky Orange Blossom. This is like liquid crack/whisky candy. Terry provided UH-mazing service. He recommended the burger (their signature dish) and it was so worth it. Terry, as well as the rest of the staff, really knows the menu and had food/drink suggestions for all of us. Would definitely come back again.
