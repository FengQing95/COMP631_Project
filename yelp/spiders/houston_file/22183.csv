Uchi////TO THE MANAGER: Our waiter was great BUT if you're going to have people other than the waiter delivering food to tables and the guest says "we didn't order that," maybe train your staff to go double check exactly what table that item should go to. We waited 20-30 minutes after our meal waiting for our fried milk dessert, and saw multiple tables getting it (they were seated after us) and overheard one say they didn't order it, so the guy said "no problem it's on the house." I don't mind waiting for food, but mistakes like this shouldn't be happening at a restaurant of this quality.
