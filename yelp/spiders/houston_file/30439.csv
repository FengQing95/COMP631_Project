The Pit Room////The beef rib is a MUST here. It is HUGE and fall off the bone kind of tender with a good char. The tacos are good if you're looking for something a little lighter with a Tex-Mex flair (brisket tacos, pulled pork tacos), and the mac and cheese is one of my favorite sides. I wasn't a huge fan of the elote here because it had so much mayo it felt almost greasy but overall this is a very solid place to get some barbecue.
