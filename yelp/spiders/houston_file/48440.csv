Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Took an Uber to his place and saw the line out the door...almost turned around because I'm flying solo today....however when I got to the hostess stand she informed me that the counter had opening seating!!!  Winning!!!  Started off with the MMmm MMm Mimosa....it was good!!!  The waitress was very helpful suggesting different entrees and even informing me of the pancake of the day!!! I ended up ordering the hash brown with 2 eggs and white toast with local jam!!!  Ohhhh, it was good!!  Couple of seconds after my food was brought out the waitress sent me the pancake of the day which was chocolate chip with this cream sauce!!!  Ohhh the cream sauce was almost as good as syrup!!!!  I still asked for some syrup....no Blackburn though!!!  All in all, definitely must come back again to do the pancakes
