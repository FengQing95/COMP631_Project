The Pit Room////I came to this restaurant because Corkscrew BBQ was closed AND my friends enjoy this place. I personally give them THREE stars, based on my plate, but my mother and aunt gave them 4 stars, so I'm going with the four rating. Their brisket was good. The pork ribs were DRY- I was not impressed at all. The Czech style beef sausage was delicious! The bbq chicken was moist and had great flavor. I also enjoyed the potato salad as well as the condiment bar. I can say that the atmosphere was very relaxing and welcoming! Be careful of the pot holes in the parking lot- those were no joke!
