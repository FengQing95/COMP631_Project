Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was good. I think it was a bit rushed, it is a busy spot in the morning. With that being said I feel like customer service could be a little bit better. A little more helpful. My juice was warm by the time I got my food. My food was sitting in front of the hostess and she still never said my food was ready until I asked about it.
