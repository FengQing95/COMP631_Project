Kata Robata////We went back, this time for a 2 person dinner date. We got papaya salad and some sashimi for apps, and rolls for entrees and some drinks. The food is still decent but service definitely was not as good as when we had a larger party. Obviously Kata is still on the pricier end compared to other sushi joints but you get what you pay for to a degree. The service this time was a bit slow, our request to be moved because it was super cold due to the AC was totally ignored by our server.
