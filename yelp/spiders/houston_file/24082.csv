Uchi////Moving on to some of the negatives, I found that the hokkaido scallop nigiri ($9) was adorned with a significant excess of wasabi, which really obscured the delicate flavor of the fresh scallop. My least favorite dish was the seaweed salad ($7), which was more complex than the typical neon-green strands you'd get at typical Japanese places, but I found the seaweed's texture to be a little too mushy and somewhat unpleasant. Service of sushi rolls can be a bit slow during happy hour, but they're usually worth the wait.
