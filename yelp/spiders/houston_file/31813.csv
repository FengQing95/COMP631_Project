Local Foods////We were greeted by a super friendly staff when we went to the counter. He gave detailed suggestion about what to order, telling us his personal favorite and the most popular item for each category we inquired on. He also gave us lots of samples. At the end, he even gave me their home-make chocolate cake FOR FREE! Perhaps he saw me eyeing it...It would have cost $5-6!
