Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very disappointing experience here. We had a large group and we were quoted that our wait would be an hour to an hour and a half. After an hour of a wait the manager came out and asked us if we would like to split up our group so they would be able to seat us. We weren't thrilled with the idea but we chose to split up our group. I find it very frustrating that they made us wait an entire hour before they realized they wouldn't be able to accommodate our group before offering us this option. The manager was also pretty rude when he came out to speak with us as if we were inconveniencing him by having a larger party. We were finally sat after an hour and a half wait. The other table received their food very quickly and were done eating before my table even received our food. So our friends had to sit there and wait for us to get our food. That was not very good service on their part. I order the grilled cheese and soup. My grilled cheese came out cold. They sandwich had literally one piece of cheese and was very dry. The soup was awful it's more of a tomato purred than a soup. It looked very unappetizing. I couldn't even eat it. I asked for pickles with my sandwich when I ordered. I had to ask the server for the pickles because they did not come out with my order. She brought me one pickle. So I had to ask for another pickle since I had two halves of a sandwich I would need two pickles. After that she never came back and checked on us again. We never received any water refills. You would think that the manager would have come to check on our experience after we were made to wait for 90 minutes just to eat here but he did not. Very poor experience. I have been a loyal customer to snooze and I can honestly say I will probably never go back to this restaurant again after this experience. Note to self do not come here if you have more than 4 people and never order the grilled cheese sandwich!
