Baby Barnaby's////My bf loves this place. He especially enjoys the French toast. The food is always on point and the coffee is delicious too. The restaurant is a bit on the small side. We drove by it on the weekend and saw lots of people waiting outside and thought maybe we should try it on a weekday. So we did! And we got seated right away. Whenever we are in the city during breakfast time, we will stop by for yummy breakfast.
