Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Nothing on the menu really seemed appealing, but that's just a personal preference thing. I ordered an almond croissant and it was good, but a little drier than I normally would like. For me, definitely a one time place, good to go once, but not good enough to go back.
