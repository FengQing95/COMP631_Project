Uchi////Hands down the best sushi I've ever had!! We enjoyed the tasting menu and each time I thought a dish was my favorite, the next one would come out and I was blown away. Everything was so fresh, delicious, and plated beautifully. Prior to coming I read raving reviews about the fried milk dessert and ..... OMG it was even better than anticipated!! We walked out full and very very happy. Â Although pricey, it was worth every single penny and I can't wait to come back.
