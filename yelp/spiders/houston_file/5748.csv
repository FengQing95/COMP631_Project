JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came in at 1115 on a Wednesday, and the restaurant had a good amount of patrons. We were immediately greeted and seated. The feel of the tables around the middle seating area feels cramped and if you talk loud enough (which is bound to happen), others would be able to hear everything.
