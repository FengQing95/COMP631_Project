Kata Robata////I highly reccomend coming to Kata if you love to experience, explored, and eat yummy food. Came here on a Friday night with reservations, arrived early and still sat us immediately. The atmosphere is "cool" and upbeat; low light, wooden bamboo-like fences, very comtemporary. Out waiter was amazing. Very helpful, insightful, knew what he was talking about, very courteous, and always checking in on us. He was aware that it was our first time at Kata and he didn't try to upsell us at all. He made recommendations that he thought we would enjoy and are the better options. He seemed like a very proud employee at Kata, which tells a lot about how they treat their staff.
