Uchi////We sat there for 10 minutes before our waiter approached us. I know he's busy; I mean, it was packed in the restaurant. But 10 minutes without a "I'll be right with you" or a "thanks for waiting?" My girlfriend and I had been playing the waiting game for over an hour, so we were ready to order and enjoy the food.
