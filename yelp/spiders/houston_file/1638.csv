JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What a great place to come eat on a cold or rainy night. Truly enjoyed eating at this place. My gf and I came here with some high expectations and they wre definitely all met. Quinn was our bartender while we sat at the bar and she was so much fun to talk to about the menu and food. We ended up ordering the Spring ramen and cha cha combo with curry rice. Both broths were fantastic, the cha cha was a bit thicker than the sprout. I would definitely recommend both. The curry rice was delicious but the fell apart a bit to quick. I can't wait to come back and try the spinach noodles.
