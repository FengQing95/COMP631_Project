Local Foods////Not sure how many of the reviews here are based on decor and atmosphere and how many are based on the food. I had the bánh mì, which was an okay (but overpriced) sandwich, and really only tangentially related to the bánh mì experience. As for the sides, the quinoa was great but the soba noddles were strange and wholly unappealing. Middle of the road, this is a cool restaurant with okay food and proud prices.
