JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Roni - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy the broth in your ramen. Can you tell me which bowl you ordered, since none of our bowls contain "chunks" of garlic or ginger. I would like to determine if there was an error in preparation. Above all, though, please know that if you are ever dissatisfied with any of your ramen bowls, just let your server know and he or she will either prepare a new bowl or offer something else. At JINYA, we live and die by our motto: "If it's not great, remake."
