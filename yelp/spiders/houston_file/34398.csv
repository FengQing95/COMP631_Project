Local Foods////The first time we got the Crunchy Chicken and the Duck Confit Sandwich with Potatoes, Slaw, Kale and Quinoa! It was so delish! The second time I took my sister and we shared a Crunch Chicken with Kale and Potato Salad and a side of the Watermelon Gazpacho. The chicken wasn't as Crunchy as the first time, but the bun was so delish! I wasn't feeling the gazpacho at all, however my sister loved it. The duck wasn't on the menu or I would've definitely gotten that again. I'd like to come back and explore the menu some more! :)
