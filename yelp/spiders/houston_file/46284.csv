Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We brought our two year old and 6 month old baby with us for a short cup of coffee. The other guests seemed pretty open to them and there were other young children at the bakery as well, although I wouldn't consider this a kid friendly place, but it worked for us. The inside of the bakery is so jammed with tables (due to their popularity I'm sure) that there wasn't space for us to maneuver our extremely small, nimble stroller. But I would absolutely come back anytime I can.
