Kata Robata////Maybe they were short handed tonight, not sure. Our server was a cool dude but that doesn't change the fact that if I'm spending over a $100 for a meal with a couple drinks that I would like better service than I would get at a Chili's or Outback Steakhouse. Probably won't be returning.
