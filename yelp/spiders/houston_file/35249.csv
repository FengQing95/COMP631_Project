Local Foods////One of my favorite lunch places! I usually go here during lunch because it's close to my work and my coworkers and I love it! Walking into the restaurant, the menus are on the left hand side on a stand and there is usually a lot of people standing in that area so it's kind of difficult to know if they are in line or not. Ordering at the register is super quick and efficient and the employees are friendly. After ordering, grab a table and wait for the food to come out. The food comes out pretty quickly which is great!
