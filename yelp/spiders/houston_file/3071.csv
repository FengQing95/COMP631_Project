JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my hands down favorite Japanese ramen noodle place in Houston. I forget the name but no. 1 is the best on the menu in my opinion. I always get takoyaki here as appetizer. Its so yummy. I literally crave this place every week. Yes, the wait can be long and boring.. But it's so worth.
