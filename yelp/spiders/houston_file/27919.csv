The Pit Room////Ordered a two meat two side with a lone star tall boy . Came out to $20.30. Ordered pulled pork and brisket with beans and Mac and cheese . The brisket was pretty good with a heavy pepper rub . The pulled pork was lacking flavor but with the added sauce was still great on the Texas sized piece of bread that was provided . Mac n cheese is always good , and the beans were spicy , just wish the server would have drained a bit of the sauce out to allow for more beans . Make sure you get some of the pickles ... They are really good !!!
