Local Foods////The food at local foods is simply amazing. The menu changes regularly and is very nontraditional. One thing that really impressed me is the side dishes! This is an of french fries or chips only place. I had acorn squash with fresh green beans and other vegetablesand it was seasoned perfectly. I also had coleslaw that was unlike any calls light ever had before. No mayonnaise, light vinaigrette and not just cabbage lettuce and red cabbage. I don't know everything that was in it but it was fantastic.The kale had an orange flavor to it and it was cooked perfectly. My daughter did have the chips with her huge chicken salad sandwich and I did try one and they were phenomenal as well. I had the banh mi sandwichwhich is Vietnamese style pork with cilantro jalapenos and to get a light sauce. The bread was perfect, the meet was perfect and the garnishes were perfect.
