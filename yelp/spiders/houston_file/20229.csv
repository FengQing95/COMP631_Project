Uchi////2.) Strong happy hour deals - This is definitely a "$$$$" restaurant, but to help offset that, schedule your reservation or arrive before 6:30pm on weekdays.  Uchi takes some of their best selections straight from their dinner menu - including items from the tastings, sushi, and makimono roll categories - and essentially cuts the price in half.  $3 sakes aren't a bad deal either...
