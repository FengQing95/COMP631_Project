Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////3.5 stars. My review is solely for the drinks/party scene as I checked out Bosscat Kitchen & Libations with some friends on a Saturday night after the kitchen had already closed (which closes at 11 PM). Bosscat is a chain which has recently expanded to Houston and is close to the River Oaks Shopping District. It's actually in the same shopping center as Eloise & Nichols Kitchen (another spot that's on the list!). Part of the parking lot was valet and part was self-parking.
