Baby Barnaby's////Eh... the food was not exactly what I expected, but the service was great. I got the salmon and bagel for breakfast but the salmon was so incredibly salty that I absolutely could not eat it. I don't know what the deal was but I've eaten fresh caught Salmon from Alaska 2 days after my friends brought it home from their fishing trip there and loved it. I also normally order salmon if I'm eating fish and it's on the menu. This salmon was just inedible.
