Baby Barnaby's////This is not a place you come hungover. Why you ask (because didn't I just give it 5 stars)? It's SMALL and if you get there after 9:30am prepare for a waaaaaait. Limited area to stand while waiting also. Came here a year ago and outdoor seating (about 5 tables) was closed due to weather and the wait would have been forever so we left!
