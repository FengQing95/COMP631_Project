Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the chicken tostadas.  They were big (saved one for dinner), and everything about it was perfect!  The chicken was shredded--not in any sauce--just seasoned and shredded.  (When we left, I noticed a lot of chickens being grilled, so that's how they cook them--no wonder it was so good!)
