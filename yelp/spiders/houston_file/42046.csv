Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute cafe in Montrose. I enjoy going there whenever I can since I live far from Montrose. They make everything from scratch and some other local restaurants nearby use their bread. I love getting their lavender latte because it has the perfect amount of lavender and they serve the drink warm not blazing hot so I can get started right away! I would definitely recommend their pastries and sweets. My favorite things to get are their grilled cheese (mostly because of the delicious apple butter they put on it) and salmon tartine. Also, you can buy their products in bulk on their website! How great is that!
