JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved the atmosphere, the staff, and food. The place and the bathroom was clean and maintained. One con is parking, there is a parking deck which we later found out we could park in, so that would've been great to know prior. If you can't park in the deck, street parking it is.
