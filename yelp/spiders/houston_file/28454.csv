The Pit Room////I'm pretty particular about my BBQ but I had been impressed by reviews from fellow Yelpers so hit it up with my cousin who was in town from LA. Unlike a lot of BBQ joints, The Pit Room is open for dinner. We arrived around 7:30 and as expected, they were out of several options I wanted to try...sad face. They make sausage in-house daily but they were all out (I wanted to try the Czech sausage). They have elote as a side which is not something I've seen at BBQ joints but they were out. This is to be expected at BBQ joints, however, so I can't knock them for that.
