The Pit Room////Came here on a Friday night and had no high hopes about the food. I was pleasantly surprised about the atmosphere, the meat and prices. I went back the following day and still didn't disappoint, even though the portions were a little smaller than the previous day. Will certainly go back during a baseball game
