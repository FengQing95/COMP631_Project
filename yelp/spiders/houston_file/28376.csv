The Pit Room////I was almost certain that the BBQ would be awesome, so I wanted to save it for last.  I started with the chips.  They were warm and crispy, and i dipped them in rojo salsa, which was good.  I do wish that they had a traditional salsa or pico de gallo.  If they did, I missed it.  Next, the mac and cheese.  My wife was not very impressed with it, but it was cheesy, warm, and a great start to the meal. I used the remaining cheese sauce to mix with some of the pulled pork.  My wife said the potato salad was pretty good, but also just "normal potato salad."  The BBQ was awesome - everything was on point, from the level of sauce, the smokiness, the temperature...it was delicious!  I quickly downed the remainder of the pulled pork, ate the bread.  I was getting full quick - then I realized I still had the brisket yet!  So, I tried that to and it was delicious - just the right amount of fat, not much sauce, and very pleasing to the taste buds!
