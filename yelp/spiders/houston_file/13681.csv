JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You are correct, though. The Spicy Vegan Ramen requires a nominal upcharge of 50 cents to make spicy because it does not contain our specialized chili paste, which contains upwards of 12 different ingredients. The Spicy Chicken Ramen and Tonkotsu Spicy, which can be served "Mild," "Spicy" or "Hot" per our customers' request, are labeled on the menu as such. In addition, each of the ramen bowls are listed with the type of noodles (thick or thin) we serve. Customers are free to request thin or thick noodles for any of their bowls, but we do not actively offer that suggestion since doing so would create a colossal backlog in service, and as you have duly noted, we already face severe wait times during peak hours.
