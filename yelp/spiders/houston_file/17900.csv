Uchi////My boyfriend and I went to Uchi during happy hour which I would recommend to anyone, especially if its your first time because you can try a lot of their items in smaller portions and at a lower cost. When we arrived sans reservation, business was rather slow because it was barely 5pm but I wanted to be sure that we'd get a seat, and have plenty of time to take advantage of the happy hour specials. We were happily greeted by a group of hostesses who immediately took us to our seats. We chose to sit at the sushi bar which, for us, was such a great experience because we love watching the knife skills and preparation of the sushi! When sitting at the sushi bar you have a sushi chef to your seats who kind of acts as your waiter at least when it comes to food. Josh was our chef and he could not have been better. I am definitely requesting him anytime I go back. He was so helpful in explaining the various unfamiliar items as well as making excellent recommendations.
