The Pit Room////Tremendous BBQ Briquet and sausage with amazing potato salad and Mac and cheese. It's a laid back atmosphere and overall very nice with helpful service. It's crowded often but with good reason, they're capable of standing out even here in Texas where BBQ is king above all others. I like my brisquet salty so if salt isn't your thing I would choose maybe the ribs or sausage. Personal preference is key here but this place is awesome!
