Kata Robata////We always enjoy dining here and highly recommend it! Located in small square with ample parking. This was our second time around. Ordered the grilled octopus and miso marinated black cod which were both excellent! The cod melts in your mouth. Another dish which is a must try is the Kobe beef skewers. The meat is marinated 72 hrs and just perfect! Never disappoints. Tried the ocean picante signature roll and loved it! It's wrapped around an asparagus and is a roll on the spicier side which was absolutely delicious and hit the spot!
