Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I would like to come back to try the brunch offerings, but I came to try the kugelhopf because I've never heard of this bakery item anywhere else outside of Houston. I was hoping that it would be similar to the French caneles, which is still impossible to find in Houston, but it was not.
