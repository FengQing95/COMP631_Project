Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I go here faithfully like every week lol! I am a five minute walk away from here. They have the most upbeat, friendliest staff! Good food and drinks! Very affordable. There is always a wait which is not a problem because the food is worth it. They have games to play while u wait if you want. If you want to check in and leave ur number you can go somewhere and come back when they text you. Or go shop next door at the clothing boutique. There is usually a wait but I always end up finding a seat or two at the bar. I loveee the bartender there! She is always friendly and recognizes me. I used to come with my fellow graveyard shit coworkers at 730 am after work. It is also kid friendly!
