JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kalah - Thank you for your 5-star review. We appreciate your kind words. Our best assumption regarding this "weird smell" you mention is the fact that the City of Houston has been digging up Louisiana and Milam Streets for the past year. On more than one occasion, their work has affected the building's plumbing as it ties into the city's sewer system. Please let us know if you run into this again so we might investigate further. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
