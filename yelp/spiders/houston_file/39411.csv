Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I always check out the menu first when I go to a new restaurant, and I'll be honest, I was not excited to go; BUT...  a friend of mine, who is always "in the know", suggested it, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm not a health nut, but the menu screamed "heart attack in the making".
