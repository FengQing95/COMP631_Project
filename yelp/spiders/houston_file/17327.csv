Uchi////We were told that this was a must eat place from several people.  We went last Tuesday nt.  Even then, there was an hour wait.  There is NO bar space inside (about 6 chairs total) to wait, so had to wait out in the wilting heat outside.  Still, we did.  Once seated at the 'family community' table, we still had mediocre service.  Don't come here for the service.  We were, however, served free sugared, grilled brussle sprouts.  I have to say I HATE brussle sprouts, but these were darn good.  Wow!  The grilled edamame was also great.  So much better than steamed.  The salmon belly was ok.  Hubby asked for a spicy tuna roll minus the cucumber as he reacts badly to it, but the chef refused at first.  The waitress said, after a 20 min. wait past ordering, that the chef felt it ruined the 'crunchy' texture.  Hello, there was jalapeno in it too.  Anyway, after some unnecessary wrangling, sir chef acquiesced and served it.  It was good.  The ambiance was disappointing, which we'd been warned about before hand.  Bad planning and layout.  Think they would have learned from the original Austin local.  Not sure I'd be in a hurry to go back, but if I lived in the area, I would.
