JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the dishes and ambiance of Jinya.Entry level diners can't go wrong with the Â Jinya 1. From there, you can add more exotic ingredients and spices. It can become packed during lunch rush, so arrive early to be seated immediately. Bar is a nice place to eat, although the planked seats can sometimes be a little hard on the backside. The food is worth the suffering!
