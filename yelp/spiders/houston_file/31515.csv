Local Foods////I usually can't justify spending $9 to $13 for a sandwich.  Local Foods is a happy exception.  This place just rocks it every time.  Just remembering the fantastic sides, great breads, and outstanding deli meats is making me hungry.  One of the greatest sandwich shops in Houston, if not the US.  Keep up the good work.
