Local Foods////The food is pretty consistent and the staff is usually pretty on point. I was upset about a particular event that occurred when we ordered hummus with vegetables. A guest from our party met up with us late and asked for a few pieces of bread. The staff was very friendly and kindly brought it over. Then, a man who didn't identify himself came over a few minutes later to ask if we paid for the bread. We said no, but we could if we needed to. He said yes, we would need to pay, took our card, and charged one dollar on it. He brought us the receipt with a menu and pointed out the price difference after we had already paid for it. Making a big deal over something so trivial isn't really a way to run a successful business.
