Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bostok-If french toast and an almond croissant made a baby, this would be it!  1 inch thick slice of buttery brioche bread soaked in almond syrup, smothered with a layer of almond cream/filling (like the stuff you find on an almond croissant) and topped with even more slices of almonds!  All this is baked to perfection so the syrup caramelizes on the edges and the almond paste creates that nice crunchy top crust and then dusted with some powdered sugar.  This is an almond lovers dream!
