Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There's a long line almost every time I come here with free coffee outside. Nice perk! I don't think the food is really all that great. A lot of the sweet breakfast options are just overly sweet, almost sickeningly so, and it makes me wonder how people consider this breakfast food...I split a couple of these with my friends, but we never finish because we're sick of all the sugar 3/4 of the way through.
