Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time here and the salad was to die for, lots of options for people with all kinds of tastes! Little bit of a tight squeeze to find a spot to sit but that's most likely due to the high demand, didn't take long to find a spot though. I will be coming back!
