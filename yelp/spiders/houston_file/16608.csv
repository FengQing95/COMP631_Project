JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy Chicken Ramen - A favorite of my friends who don't eat pork, this one's a solid choice for first-timers. My "hack" is to order the regular Jinya Chicken Ramen and spice it up myself with the hot chili paste at each table - that way you can really tailor it while saving a dollar. Be warned that the chicken chashu isn't as tasty as the traditional pork version; it leans on the rubbery side, doesn't stand up to the aromatic broth, and is honestly the weakest part of the bowl.
