JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Leslie - Thank you for your review. I agree that a loud dining atmosphere is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this, unfortunately, is one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise.
