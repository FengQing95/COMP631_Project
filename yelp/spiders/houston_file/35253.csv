Local Foods////I think I'm in love...or at the very least addicted. Out of the dozens upon dozens of times I've been here, never once have I been dissapointed. The food and service always on point. Fresh ingredients at reasonable prices. Pigging out without feeling guilty. It doesn't get any better than that! My recommendation is to go for the Garden Sammie with chicken (or without for you vegetarians). Who knew a vegetable sandwich could taste so good??
