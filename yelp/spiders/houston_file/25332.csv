Uchi////Overall, the appetizers were tasty and contained some surprises, though only one or two were genuinely memorable. The Veggie Mushi was an absolute flavor bomb of sweet, spicy, and sour in the vein of a Thai Tom Kha soup. The Kinoko Usuzukari (thinly sliced mushrooms) is essentially an interesting vegetarian take on a delicate crudo; the vinegary and umami notes are delivered via fine sheets of spongy fungi topped with shallots. The copious charred and salty edamame were a nice filler course. The Brussel Sprouts with lemon and chili were decent, but the original Uchi sprouts with caramelized fish sauce are leaps and bounds better. The Miso Soup was unremarkable.
