Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't even know where to begin. Maybe I will start with the fact that you WILL wait to get in here. I have never been crazy about breakfast but this place will change all that. The wait was 45 minutes and the wait staff is very kind and friendly.The coffee is strong and hot. We got mimosas and they do have a choice of which juice to put in it. We had a generic one and it was very good ordered an egg white omelet and it was very delicious. We also got the OMG French toast and my world have been changed for the better. Being how everything in Texas is bigger that is applied to the french toast. I took one bite and it was soft but not in a soggy way and it had such a rich creamy buttery flavor. It definitely brought tears to my eyes. If you visit and order anything this has to be it and for the future all French toast will need to live up to this Flavor.
