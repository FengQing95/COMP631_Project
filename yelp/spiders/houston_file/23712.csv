Uchi////However, my fiance and I visited last night. We had made a reservation two weeks prior for February 15 at 5:15. Upon making the reservation, I asked the lady if we'd be able to take advantage of the sake social hour. She said yes. When we arrived at 5:10, the bar was packed. We realized we should have specified that we wanted our reservation to be at the bar. Oh well, our bad. We got a table and were excited for a long anticipated happy hour.
