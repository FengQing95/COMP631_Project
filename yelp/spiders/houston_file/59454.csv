Baby Barnaby's////My wife and I ate Baby Barnaby's for breakfast and it was good and would definitely be going back. I would say its a little different of a breakfast place with some different items on the menu. Its more the the organic type of place and not a place that serves biscuits and gravy. The menu is somewhat smaller than what you would think a breakfast place would offer but the dishes were good that my wife and I had. The orange juice is fresh and good as well as the coffee.
