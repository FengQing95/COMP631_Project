Kata Robata////I am a biiig ramen fan. I was told that the ramen at Kata Robata is excellent. So for numerous Thursdays over the last 6 months, I have been hitting this place up for the ramens especially, the spicy ramen. Last night, the wifey and I decided to change it up a bit and tried the sashimi salad, other sashimi entrees and a few rolls. The dinner was mind blowing. The quality of the ingredients is excellent and the coupled with good preparation and immaculate presentation, its a very enjoyable experience. The service was good too; the wait staff kept the sake flowing. I highly recommend this joint.
