JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We also ordered and enjoyed their Spicy Umami Miso Ramen.  The pork broth: ground pork, bean sprouts, green onions, bok choy, chili oil, served with thick noodles.  We wanted to try the best of both worlds, and I would say this is the best.  While the broth was surprisingly not that spicy (it did have a small kick), this broth was incredibly well integrated and flavorful. It had me drinking all the way to the bottom of the bowl (and I would have had not the 6 month old gotten cranky).   Even though it is all about the broth, we also loved the texture of the thick noodles much better.
