Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I wont lie when i say I was a bit skeptical about this place. When I first heard that my friends I were gonna have dinner here, I wasn't exactly excited because I am not a whisky girl. I was pleasantly surprised though when we the food came out. We ordered a few appetizers and i think the stand out was the Pig Candy. It sounds weird but it is absolutely delicious. The two main entrees that seemed to be the favorite was the Shrimp and Grits and the Short Rib. I think by far this place has the best shrimp and grits. They add in these garlic bits that just give an extra kick to the grits. The short rib was so tender that you could just use your fork and tear it. The best part about the short rib was the scalloped potato underneath. It paired so well with the sauce that was drizzled on top. If you want to be extra adventurous, you should mix the ribs with a bit of potato and some grits... omg YUM!
