The Pit Room////AMAZING food, surprisingly outstanding wine selection for a snotty Caucasian girl, and spectacular service. They even have a take a Kouzi, leave a kouzi exchange program. Oh, but the BBQ. Brisket was tender, not too overly smoked, and really, probably the best I have ever had. Serious.  Paired with a dry Rose, (angels and cowboys)  and topped off with Mac N cheese, and you got a perfect dinner. Great price, great people, great food. Please stay away from the highway place, "Goode BBQ" which really is horrible, and go here for way better everything. Especially the people and wine!
