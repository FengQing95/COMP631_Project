Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So good! Came on a Tuesday night during the holiday season and they were packed but we were able to get seated fairly quickly (less than 10 minutes). Our waiter was very attentive and the food was very flavorful. Great ambiance (perfect for a date night!) with dimmed lights but not too dark to where you can't see your hands or if there's spinach in your teeth. Dressy casual or "smart casual" -- not dumb casual, ya hear? I've never understood that lol. But we saw t-shirt and jeans too. Seems chill enough a place.
