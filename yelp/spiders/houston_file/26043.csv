The Pit Room////The barbecue was amazing. Got the two meat dinner plate (ribs & brisket) along with the mac & cheese & beans. The bark on the meat was awesome, mac & cheese creamy, the beans had a nice kick to them. Looking forward to my next visit to try the sausage. Place will be rocking this Fall!
