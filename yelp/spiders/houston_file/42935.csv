Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After visiting Common Bond a handful of times, I can easily say that this place is absolutely amazing! They consistently deliver great breakfast and brunch items and make the most delicious pastries and bread around. Their breakfast sandwiches never disappoint and they vary on the weekends. It's pretty common for them to have a line, especially on the weekends. But the wait is absolutely worth it if you haven't been before. My personal favorite!
