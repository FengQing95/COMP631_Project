The Pit Room////There have been so many new BBQ joints popping up in town and some are trying to do the beef ribs, but many fail miserably. Right now Killen's is the king, but the pit room is not far behind. They keep it simple with the rub. And just do a great job of smoking it to the point it's really tender.
