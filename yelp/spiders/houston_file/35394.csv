Local Foods////This spot is adorable, small and intimate inside, but has outdoor seating in the front and back. Social distancing was fairly easy on a Saturday afternoon, the environment is quiet and inviting for a nice meal. Parking is close, free, and easy. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and you can tell they put thought into the decor, which isn't necessary but always a nice touch!
