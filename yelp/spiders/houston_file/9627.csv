JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's a bit noisy and I'm not completely happy with group seating, but they do have a few booths and tables so occasionally we'll get lucky and end up sitting at one of those (without specifying we want to sit there, never asked but I'm assuming the wait time adds up for specific seating). I should also add that for the most part it's always busy and poppin, so expect to wait- it could be less than 10 minutes or maybe up to 30..
