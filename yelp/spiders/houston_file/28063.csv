The Pit Room////Brisket was tough and chewy with a flat tasting bark. It ate more like jerky than brisket. There were no hints of any wood either. It tasted like it came out of the smoker 10 hours too early. When I placed the order, I saw a cook seasoning 2 slabs of brisket behind the counter. That's not a good sign because it looked he was about to toss in another bundle of quick-make brisket. Besides the bad brisket, the day was scorching hot and it was hot inside as well. They didn't bother blasting the a/c so we decided to do a to-go order. Had we dined there, I would have sent that brisket back in a jiff. BAD bbq is bad bbq - people should get arrested for it. Given the other reviews on this place, I feel like I've been swindled, bamboozled, and cheated. One and done.
