Uchi////Ambiance-wise, the restaurant was very nice, so no complaints there. We did end up spending a bit more money than we initially expected when we walked in, but the waiter did tell us all the prices as we were ordering our food and drinks, so that's more on us than them :) Overall, I would potentially come back here for an important night like an anniversary or something, but Houston has so many cool restaurants that I'd be tempted to try something else instead. In other words, I didn't leave feeling like I absolutely had to come back. If we did go back, I think we would choose some specific courses instead of doing the tasting.
