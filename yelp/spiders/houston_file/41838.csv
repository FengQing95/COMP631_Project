Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been looking forward to this place opening since I heard about it if for no other reason than the promise of a good baguette. There are basically no to minimal options for a good baguette in Houston. Granted its a limited market, but it has always been a bit of a mystery to me since it is such a big city. Central market baguette is pretty good and whole foods has good flavor and texture in my opinion. But everywhere else like HEB is basically an elongated dinner roll that may or may not have come from a freezer.
