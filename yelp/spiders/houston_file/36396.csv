Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Was excited for my first visit, had a reservation. Quickly was turned off by the hostess with dark hair and blue eyes. She was very upset that we didn't want to sit right next to the front door (showed it) so gave us an even worse table. The entire experience was awkward. The eye rolling won't get you very far, doll. We left. No thanks.
