Uchi////To top off excellent food, the service there probably was just as equally wonderful.  Our server (forgot his name) was top notch, was on top of everything, had an awesome story or tid bit to share about every item we were eating and was very interactive.  I feel that usually when you are eating at a restaurant, something lacks somewhere.  Here, nothing sticks out.  Everything from the decor, to the food, to the service was great for us.
