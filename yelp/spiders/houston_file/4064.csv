JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston//// The ramen and broth are different than other options in town but I guess no two places are alike.  It was pretty good but not super delicious.  They got the egg right and the other major ingredients seemed ok.  The bowl is a little small but you can get extra ramen or extra broth for an additional charge.
