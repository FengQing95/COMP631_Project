JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Started off with the shrimp balls which were delish - make sure you have someone to share with as they come in servings of four and you want to make sure you have room for the Ramen. Â I liked that they were coated in a crispy rice like coating opposed to the typical and expected panko.
