Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My pro-tip to you. You can avoid the lines if you get there before 8 am. This means waking up early, but it's worth not having to wait for 60-90 minutes for a table. For that wait, I could run to Central Market, grab my own ingredients and throw down a nice brunch for friends. But then cleaning up would suck. So maybe the wait is worth it :)
