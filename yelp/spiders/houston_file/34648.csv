Local Foods////Here's what Local Foods IS: it's a staple in my diet, the go-to for healthy/flavorful, I can feel *relatively* guiltless after getting a filling and satisfying meal, I can come here with a date, a best friend, or a group. I can rely on quality and consistency, I can get a craft beer, and I can spend under $20. I cannot, however, spend under $15 (theoretically I could, but this would mean depriving myself of tea, organic soda, a seven layer bar, or a beer- none of which I am willing to forgo).
