Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////A really great breakfast spot in Houston! My sister and I visited and loved our meals. We both tried the benedict and pancake sampler. Loved the traditional benedict and the chilaquiles benedict. The caprese was okay, a little too sweet for my taste. All three pancakes were yummy, but our favorite was the pineapple upside down cake.
