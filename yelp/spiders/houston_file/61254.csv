Baby Barnaby's////Went in at 2 on a Sunday at 11:30 am and were able to sit immediately at one of two open tables (holiday weekend - not sure about regular weekend mornings). Street parking available not sure if they have their own lot. Intimate diner-like interior thats a little noisy but the staff is nice and the food and coffee come quickly (and are yummy) which makes it worth the visit.
