JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend had the vegetable ramen and I had the spicy chicken ramen. Honestly, the veggie ramen was really good! All it needed was a bit of hot sauce, which they provide you with at every table. My spicy chicken ramen was 'hot' but of course I added more hot sauce. To me it wasn't too spicy at all. But if you aren't big on spicy food I suggest you stick with 'mild'. If you are trying to stay away from meat, try the veggie ramen. It was tasty! Next time I go, I'll probably get it and just add hot sauce.
