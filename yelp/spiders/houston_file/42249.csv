Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been here only once, but I can't wait to come back for some more! I only tried the Almond Croissant and Chocolate Croissant. The place is very clean and open and the service is very nice :) We were there on a Saturday ~2:30pm and the line was just starting at the door. It doesn't take too long.
