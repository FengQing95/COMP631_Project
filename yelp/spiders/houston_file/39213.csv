Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Decided to try this place out for a late lunch. Went with the Bosscat Burger and fries (to go), which must be ordered separately. $23 for a less than decent burger and "fries", which are a disaster; basically just over cooked deep fried chucks of potato. I would say to skip the burger and fries. Stick to the whiskey.
