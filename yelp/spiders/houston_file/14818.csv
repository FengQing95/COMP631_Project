JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The places decor is so beautiful, I loved the ambiance. We ordered Ramen and it was so good! The broth was so flavorful and rich. Only disappointing part is that we arrived close to closing. We wanted to order mocho after dinner and the waitress said the kitchen was closed. I have been to plenty of restaurants that the waitresses will come to the table and ask if anything else needs to be ordered before the kitchen closes. If I would of gotten my litchi I would have given 5 stars
