Uchi////Though I was quite hesitant at first, I feel like this place lives up to the hype. Every time I've visited, the staff were well-mannered and trained well on the menu items. They check back constantly to see if you need anything and always refill your water (they give you a liter container for the table). If you're on a budget but want tasty and interestingly mixed foods, happy hour is the best bet. I went with my family, 4 people at the time, and we all walked out contently full and only spent around $80. Everything was ordered off the happy hour menu, except for maybe 1-2 items. Everything was tasty and had very nice presentation. If it is your first time dining at Uchi, the servers will explain the contents of the dish and the way it is meant to be eaten. The mint chocolate they have at the door prior to your leaving is tasty as well, but that's coming from a chocoholic!
