The Pit Room////When in Houston, one must eat BBQ.  It was a Monday early evening and absolutely gorgeous out. I got here a bit before 5:30 and did not have to wait at all.  I got my food and went and ate outside.  I tried the turkey ( i don't eat pork or red meat) with the daily special of charred green beans (amazing), Mac and cheese and coleslaw.  I didn't really like the coleslaw but everything else was awesome.  So glad I came here and took advantage of the nice evening.
