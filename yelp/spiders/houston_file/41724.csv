Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went there with high expectation! Unfortunately, these were only partially met. The Reuben was half cooked with a pudding or jelly like sauce, supposedly Thousand Island. The beef tongue was not the thing to add here and the egg beneath was half raw, which I think is what gave me Â food poisoning I was able to enjoy later that day and next. We also had the endive salad (good), the French Toast (good, but too saturated with sauce), and assortment of breads (very good). My 2 cents - stick with the bakery part, the rest - mmjaah!
