Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We walked in during Sunday brunch hour rush. Parking is scarce, you have to park in a different neighborhood and take a walk down in Montrose which I can't complain about. Ordering takes a while, they were placed and the seating area needs more open space to walk.
