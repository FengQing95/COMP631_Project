Uchi////The food was awesome! The right side of your Â menu will have more traditional sushi and sashimi offerings but I strongly encourage you to try that left side of the menu for some adventurous Japanese cusine. We pigged out and had the Hama Chili, FREE AMAZING Brussels Sprouts, the Spicy Crunchy Tuna, the Hot Rock and the Jar Jar Duck in that order. Evidently, the chef curates your meal by like a museum of modern art by serving the food you order in the order he best sees fit and I think he knows what he's talking about. The Hama Chili, the sprouts, and the Duck were definitely highlights but all of the food was fantastic.
