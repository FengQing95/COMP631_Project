Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////With so many Yelp reviews pointing me here, I just knew I was in for a treat. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. The menu was very short and I found myself settling when I made my choice. I chose the burrito and it was subpar. My gues had the Fruity Pebbles French toast with a side of $4 scrambled eggs. Nothing to write home about.
