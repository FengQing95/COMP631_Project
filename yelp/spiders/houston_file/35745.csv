Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My first time having a meal at Bosscat and the food was delicious. I had the snapper on fried rice which I could not stop eating! They have a great cocktail menu and wide variety of whiskey. I'm not a whiskey person but the drink called BossLady was just delicious! The service was great, especially Terry who helped us navigate the cocktail and food menu! The music is a bit loud, so probably not the best place for a first date. Would definitely visit again!
