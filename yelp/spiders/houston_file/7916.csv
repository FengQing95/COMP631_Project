JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya or Tiger den? The great debate. You cant go wrong with either. I'm pretty new to the ramen scene, but I agree with everyone that these two restaurants serve the best ramen in H town. The broth is key and its' bursting full of flavor whether you like pork or soy based. I also like the fact that you can get unlimited fresh garlic (for free I might add. I haven't tried their sides but they look delicious. The downside: Parking is tough around midtown and the restaurant is small, but its well worth the wait. Priced at $10-12 per bowl of ramen. You can also get the combos with the salad or rice plates.
