JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been here a few times and have loved it every single time. Even on the worst day to go when it was raining and the streets were flooding, the restaurant was still popping. We came in drenched and the hosts offered up paper towels to dry us off. The wait is usually 30-45 min long for 2 people.. Thats pretty much the only downside.
