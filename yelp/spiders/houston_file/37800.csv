Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They have a pretty good drink menu ranging from different beers to different specialty cocktails. They also have a pretty cool display of whiskys in a glass room. The place is very trendy and is alot bigger then you might initially think. This place would be a great place to come if you had a big group for dinner.
