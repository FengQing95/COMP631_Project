Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I feel that I am in the majority if Â I say that 9:00 AM on a Sunday is pretty early for brunch, right? Well, not early enough for Snooze! I came here with my mom then and was told that there was already a 1.5 hour wait. We ended up coming back the next day, Monday, at 6:45 AM--with NO WAIT!
