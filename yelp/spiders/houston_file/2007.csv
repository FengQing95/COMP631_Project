JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So yummy! I came here with my sister for an early lunch and as soon as we had a small taste of our food, we just knew we made the best decision by coming here. I was really scared to try ramen at first because I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I was wrong. It's the best thing I've ever tasted. The place is so beautiful (small) and the service is splendid. I got the spicy chicken ramen and my sister got the cha cha cha (garlic and pork). I'm usually in the same area because I get my Vietnamese food nearby but now I know if I ever crave ramen, I can easily come here. The place gets packed very quickly, so I recommend stopping by around lunch time to avoid the crowd. Its so yummy! :-)
