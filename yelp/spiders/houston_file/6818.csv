JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As a franchise concept, Los Angeles-based JINYA contractually obligates its franchisees to follow guidelines for food quantities, preparation and service. Therefore, the amount of toppings we put in each bowl has been predetermined, and moreover, most of our fresh produce must be "imported" from California to ensure quality control, all of which comes at a higher cost than what we might be sourced locally. And while the market price of fresh bamboo (we don't use canned) may fluctuate, our prices for toppings must remain fixed.
