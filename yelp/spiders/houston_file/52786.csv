Kata Robata////It was still happy hour so we started with some sake. Good thing because what came after was not impressive. Based on other yelpers' review, we ordered the $14 (yes, you read that right) Kobe beef skewers and kimchi chicken to start. Kimchi chicken was just okay - tasted like chick-fil-a nuggets resting in kimchi grits (which I'll admit, were awesome). Chatty Kathy informed us that people come in and order a bowl of just it. I can see why. Kobe beef skewers were a major letdown. First of all, it only came with 4 cubes of beef. I hear skewer and I expect at least a chopstick's length stick of meat. In accordance to what others have said, the beef was very tender (they cook it for 72 hrs) but had next to no flavor, which was disappointing. The sauce they provide with it you would hope would help but sadly, it doesn't. We shouldn't have wasted our money.
