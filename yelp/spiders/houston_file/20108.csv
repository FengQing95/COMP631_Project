Uchi////It's a shame that the best thing I had all night was a fried and battered onion.  Your omakase, the chef's ten course meal, left me wondering if your chef had any taste buds in his/her mouth.  Some of the plates looked like miniature male sexual organs protruding from the plate (prawns with peas and carrots) and tasted like baby food.  I just want delicious food!  Presentation is great and wonderful but can you just feed me well?  Hell, glad it wasn't some special event like my birthday or something!
