Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- Benny Duo (half portions of ham benedict and chilaquiles benedict): Kind of disappointing. The classic ham benedict was solid but nothing special, and the chilaquiles was kind of odd. It has a corn tortilla base that got really soggy and overall just didn't work for me. Would not order any of their benedicts again.
