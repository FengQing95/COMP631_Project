The Pit Room////Was in Houston for work and wanted to try Texas BBQ. Received a recommendation from a local to try this place. When I arrived had a long line but moved fast. Food was amazing and fresh. They own the bar next door so you can choose to eat on the patio and the bar has bigger selection of beer and drinks.
