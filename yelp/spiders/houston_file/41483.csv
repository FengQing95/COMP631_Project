Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////For a place with so much hype surrounding it, I expected more from the chocolate chip cookie. I honestly didn't like it. I think I could make a better one myself, no actually I KNOW I can make a better one myself. Now I haven't tried anything else here, as when I went they were sold out of -everything- literally. But it's kind of like tasting salsa at a Mexican restaurant, that's how you gauge authenticity. So if that cookie is anything to go by, not sure how the other stuff holds up. I still have every intention of going back and seeing what the croissant is all about.
