Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Trendy but unimpressive breakfast chain. Expect long waits for a table and a menu full of pancakes adorned with confectionary gimmicks.  I have eaten here twice and each time found 1+ hr weekday waits (even at the seat yourself counter), indifferent wait staff (unless you know someone, wink, wink), underdone pancakes and overdone bacon.  I really didn't enjoy their food. But, I like fully cooked pancakes with fresh fruit in the batter.  If you like $6 cupcakes with a 3" crown of icing & sprinkles, and frequently employ the word "ahh-may-zing" this might be your place.
