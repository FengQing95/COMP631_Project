Baby Barnaby's////So we visited BBC for the first time on Oct 26....arrived around 12:30 p.m. and had a 40+min wait...with a 4 year old....we were thinking "This BETTER be good".  The coffee bar/water station outside makes for a nice consolation(the coffee is GOOD).  So we finally get seated and the justification immediately reveals itself.  The attentive and personal attention the staff provides is ABOVE AND BEYOND AVERAGE.  We were obviously impressed, as we returned today.  This time arriving around 11:00 a.m., and waiting again for 30 minutes.  The service, the people watching and oh yeah...the FOOD....totally make it worth it.
