Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although I wasn't able to get my drink on due to me leaving my DL at home and my food kept coming out cold, this is an exceptional place to have brunch. I had the best breakfast blueberry something pancake here. Oh and my shrimp and grits were good if it had of came out hot like everything else. Would recommend this place anytime. Customer service was great between my server which was a sweet heart and the manager as well.
