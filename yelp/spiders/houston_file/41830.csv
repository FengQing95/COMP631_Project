Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The atmosphere is always welcoming and I love their latte art. My current fav drink to get there is the Lavender Latte! What makes this place an absolute gem has to be the helpful and energetic baristas as well as being able to see coffee being brewed and baristas taste-testing their product before they serve it!
