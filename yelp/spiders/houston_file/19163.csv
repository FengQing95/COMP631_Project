Uchi////Let me just say that I was starving as I left, as in my meal here served as an appetizer. Maybe I just have a lot of room for food? I don't know, but I do know that I probably would not come back here on my own by choice, I have other favorite sushi spots that I feel the value is matched by the price. If someone takes me on a date or I am invited, then sure why not? It is all good food, but I was not so blown away by the food to justify spending more money coming back here. Don't get me wrong I will go to all lengths for bomb food, but the value has to be there and I just do not think it is here. You should all come at least once though and judge for yourselves. I mean hello they have 4 1/2 stars.
