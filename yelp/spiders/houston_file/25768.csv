The Pit Room////I'm not an expert by any means, but I am a big fan of Texas barbecue. The pit room has been the best barbecue I've had so far. I tried the pork ribs and the brisket dinner. Very delicious and smoky huge portions. From now on every time I visit Houston I will have my barbecue here no doubt. Next time I will have the beef rib which I heard also is very delicious.
