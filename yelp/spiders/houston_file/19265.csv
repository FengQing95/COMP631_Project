Uchi////we had plans for a double date on Saturday at 8pm. I called on Tuesday and they had no available tables except 10:15. fair enough. it's a new swanky place that is getting great reviews.... you can expect that. we arrive just after 7:30 and they tell us it'll be an hour wait and we can hang out at the bar. the rest of our group was running late so it worked out.
