Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had Benedict 2 ways- avacado and one with barbacoa... and the barbacoa gave me an "I can't believe it's not butter" moment it was delicious. And the flight of pancakes- chocolate chip (nothing to write home about) OMG French toast was OMG and the sunrise pancake hit it out of the park for me. We had to wait on a Thursday at like 1030 but service was great and food was worth it.
