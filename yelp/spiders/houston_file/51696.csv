Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// : Do they carry the steak egg Benedict ? He informed me that due to Covid-19 there was a limited menu, fine no big deal right, so my next order is a mimosa. Peter tells me that the mimosa can't be ordered for another 5 minutes because they don't start serving liquor until 10am, once again I say that's fine, (still no orange juice btw)
