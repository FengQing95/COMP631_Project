Uchi////We ordered the Omakase to get a variety of items since it was our first experience and because it includes many of their most popular dishes. We also added a few of our favorite sushi and couldn't choose between the Walu Walu and Pork Belly so we got both! The Walu Walu was perfection, the Pork Belly was complimented by a delicious sauce and the sushi melted in your mouth.
