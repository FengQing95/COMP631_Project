The Pit Room////This place was great!  Brisket was top-notch and the sausage had a great flavor and texture.  Authentic, home made and you can tell they place a high importance on quality.  Seating inside on a mildly chilly nigh was somewhat cramped, but plenty of seating outside on a normal Houston day/night is more than ample.
