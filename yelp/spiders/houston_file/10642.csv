JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Midtowners... If you don't want to travel far to China town for Ramen... JINYA Ramen is the place to go...I love the broth that they use.. the noodles are great.. overall is excellent..the ambience are casual, earthy, and urban.  Great for family or group of friends.. I can't eat pork so I  always order the spicy chicken ramen medium spicy with seasoned egg and nori dried seaweed.(pork free)... they have option for the vegetarian also. The fried chicken tenders or finger is amazed balls... so 100% recommended. ..come out and Check it out..
