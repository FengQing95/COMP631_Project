JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Teresa - Thank you very much for the great review. I'm glad we were worth your trip. In the future, if there's ever any issue with your bowl of ramen, just let your server know and he or she will make things right. We take pride in our customers walking away from our establishment satisfied, which is why we take the time to review every review that comes through. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
