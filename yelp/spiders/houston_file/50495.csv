Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place has such good vibes and good eats. Mimosas are really tasty at a good price. The French toast I had were a bit on the sweet side so I'd stick to the traditional side next time and keep it simple. The atmosphere is super cute and the staff is friendly. I've been twice now and the wait can be pretty outrageous by around 11 so I'd suggest you get there around 9 or 10 for little to no wait. There's pretty good parking as there's a parking lot but street parking is available too, both free and paid. I've never had a problem parking in this area. I recommend for sure for a cute brunch spot.
