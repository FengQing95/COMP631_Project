Baby Barnaby's//// Additionally, the food here is just plain awesome. Everything is fresh including the orange juice that is hand-squeezed and is a must for any first timer. I've tried the High Protein Burrito which comes with ripe avocado and tomatoes. The burrito lacks a bit but its a true healthy option that allows you to go out to breakfast with friends and not cheat on your diet.
