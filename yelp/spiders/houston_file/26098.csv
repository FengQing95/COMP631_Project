The Pit Room////A welcome addition to the Montrose area, Michael Sambrooks and chef Bramwell Tripp deliver excellent handcrafted barbecue, sides, and desserts that will please the most discriminating of barbecue hounds. Brisket, pork spareribs, and smoked chicken are solid contenders for some of the best in the city. Three types of sausages are made fresh daily at the Pit Room, a rarity in the Houston barbecue market. They include a Czech-style all-beef, a venison, and a pork with jalapeno and melty cheese. All are excellent, and I recommend including at least one when considering your ordering options. Try all three tacos also, which are served on house-made tortillas that incorporate rendered smoked brisket fat (in lieu of traditional lard or shortening). They include a chopped brisket with cheddar cheese, sour cream, salsa roja, and cilantro; a pulled pork with salsa verde, pickled red onions, cotija cheese, and cilantro; and my favorite, the pulled chicken with smoked green chile, griddled asadero cheese, and charred garlic. Great cherry pie for dessert, and also three different ice cream sandwiches to choose from using homemade cookies and gelato from Dolce Gelato!
