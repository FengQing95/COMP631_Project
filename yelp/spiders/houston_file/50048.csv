Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very solid brunch location! Cute and trendy on the inside and a ton of food options. The staff is very friendly and try to make the long wait time comfortable. They have coffee and water out while you wait for a table and try to seat people as fast as possible. I will definitely be eating here again.
