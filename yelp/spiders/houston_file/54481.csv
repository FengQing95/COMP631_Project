Kata Robata////The sashimi here is comparable to seafood I've had fresh out of the ocean in Asia (literally). It's really good folks. While there's no ocean view, the best seat in the house is at the sushi bar. I usually like to be seated away from people but this particular evening, my boyfriend and I were seated here and I rather preferred it. I loved watching the sushi chefs make the eye-catching sashimi platters and sushi rolls but then again, I've always been a fan of open kitchen concepts. The hustle and bustle of the sushi chefs really enhanced the experience, and trust me, they'll make sure you're well taken care of.
