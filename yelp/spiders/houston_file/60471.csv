Baby Barnaby's////This horrible one star review is not about the food.  The food is amazing,  however it's about how poorly we were treated this morning. We knew that Saturday mornings are busy, so we called ahead asking about a wait for 2 with a dog. The woman on the phone told me that the they had a dog-friendly table open immediately at the moment. By the time we arrived (within 10 minutes) there were two couples with dogs that had arrived right before we did. We didn't think too much of it, and one of the couples was sat at a small table in the very corner of the patio with their dog. Little did we know, that was the ONLY dog friendly table they provide their guests. It was not made aware to us that they only had one table for dogs--we thought as long as we were outside on the patio, things would be okay. So we waited for 45 minutes for a patio table to open up, just to watch them seat a a couple with no dog (and who had waited maybe 15 minutes) at the newly-opened patio table. When we asked a waiter why other couple with the dog that came in right before us wasn't seated there, it was THEN made to our attention that they only have ONE table on the patio that they use for patrons with dogs. When we asked him why that information was not disclosed to us earlier (it's not like they didn't see the 4 people in the waiting area with two dogs who have waited for almost an hour), they chose to tell us only if we asked. On top of that, the waiter tried to defend their miserable "dog friendly" status by stating that they DO ask if you have a dog on their beat up clipboard/waitlist (it says "dogs?" Yes/No). I mean, yeah just because you ask if we have a dog doesn't mean it tells us that our wait time is approximately 2 hours if there are two other dogs ahead of you. So no, dude, it's not the same. Not coming back for a while. I'm utterly disgusted with the way that we were treated and I am a pretty regular customer who always recommends this restaurant to friends by ranting and raving about the wonderful food and service. Not anymore Baby Barnaby's, not anymore.
