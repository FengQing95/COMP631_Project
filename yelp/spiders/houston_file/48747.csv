Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's really good breakfast food. And the menu is very adventurous and unique while still being very diner-y and brunch-appropriate. The coffee is good, the service is friendly, the prices are not bad at all. They even source some of their products from local purveyors. I wanted to hate Snooze, but it warmed my cold, dead heart and taught me to like brunch again.
