Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went here for brunch on Sunday and it was AMAZING! I had the tater tots, fruity pebble French toast, and the steak and eggs flat bread. My favorite were the tater tots but everything was amazing. We also got a pitcher of mimosas which was $30. Our overall tab was about $80. Not bad at all for three people's brunch. They also have a live Dj that was really good! Def recommend!
