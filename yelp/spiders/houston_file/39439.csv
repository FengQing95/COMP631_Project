Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is a review based on an experience I had several months ago with 3 other friends. I was reminded of it recently because of how much better other whiskey bars are in the city. My friends and I had come to the bar after watching a movie and I attempted ordering a couple of different whiskeys. I was in the mood for Rye whiskey on this particular day, and two of the ryes I wanted the bartenders informed me slowly (literally this was a 15 minute process) that they no longer carried. When I was looking at the menu (yet again) for a third rye, one of the bartenders offered me a glass of something and when I tasted it, I noticed it was bourbon and I told him I did not want bourbon, that I was looking for a rye. He then asked me if I even knew the difference between rye and bourbon.....
