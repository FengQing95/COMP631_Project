Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cons: Parking is horrible. This place is so busy and I've always struggled to find parking no matter what day or time of the day it was. The place is always packed so it's hard to find a place to sit and relax. The coffee is inconsistent and tasted burnt last time. And lastly, the food selection is way too limited and overpriced with almost no vegetarian options.
