Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We went to this place after eating so much, so I opinion is a bit clouded.  First the good they the wide variety of nicely decorated pastries.  The fancy cakes and cookie etc.  The latte has nice fancy latte on in.  The decors is very modern and nicely done. The meal selection is great.
