Local Foods////Went in recently for the first time... What a great choice! You order up front and sit down, the food is served to you. The atmosphere was perfect, very comfortable seating. We each had seafood gumbo, it was perfect. I tried the mint-citrus house drink, very refreshing. The staff was really nice and we had a great dining experience. Pretty reasonable prices for the area. Will definitely go back!
