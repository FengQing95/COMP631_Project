JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth is heavy, rich, and creamy, and probably the biggest difference from Tiger Den's (atypically) light tonkotsu broth. I haven't found a better broth anywhere in the world except at Ippudo. The thin noodles that come with the Tonkotsu Black are soft and don't really feel al dente, but I prefer it that way. Tiger Den's noodles are noticeably firmer and chewier. You get 4 large slices of chashu here (vs. 2 at Tiger Den), and each slice is extremely soft and tender, more so than Tiger Den's.
