Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My biggest problem with Common Bond, however, is its prices. At $9.20 for a pastry and a coffee, I could easily be eating a full meal. The other times I've come in, I've ordered off the lunch menu, which is just as delicious, but even more pricy. Unless you're planning on staying a while to take advantage of the free refills, adding a drink to your order can more than double the price of your order. Next time I come in, I'll be ordering just pastries - no coffee for me, thanks!
