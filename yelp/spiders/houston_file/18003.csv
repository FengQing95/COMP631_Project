Uchi////I must say the foie gras was absolutely sensational.  However, the rest of the sushi selection (uni, scallop, flounder, salmon, fatty salmon) were good but didn't blow me out of the water.  The scallop with the avocado was a surprisingly good combination but I didn't particularly care for mint in the uni sushi.
