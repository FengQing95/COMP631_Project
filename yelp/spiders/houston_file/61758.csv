Baby Barnaby's////I and my partner was coming from work this past Friday  and stopped into  a neighborhood bar, but after we had finished our drinks and decided to go this Baby Barnarby's. I did not realized that I was sleeping off, and this stupid and rude waiter started to shout at me and demanded that I wake up, I know that waiting does not make a enough money, but there are some people that  do work hard for a living, especially if your an Executive Chef and General Manager like myself. I would not patron this restaurant at all
