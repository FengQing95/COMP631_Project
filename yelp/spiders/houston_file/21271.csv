Uchi////This is by far the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to. The atmosphere, d√©cor, staff, food and drinks are all over the top. I usually set the bar pretty high for service and I have really feel like Uchi has the most well-trained staff in town. They are always punctual, friendly, accommodating and very knowledgeable. Friday HH is my favorite time to go as it gives you an opportunity to try a little bit of everything in a little bit more of a casual setting.
