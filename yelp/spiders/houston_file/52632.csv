Kata Robata////By the way, I wanted to give this place half a star for my overall experience. Take my advice...save your money and hit up another sushi joint that believes in quantity, quality and a fully trained staff capable of delivering a decent drink (unless you enjoy spending money on small portions of nasty food/drinks).
