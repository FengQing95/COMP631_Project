JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We had the Tonkatsu Black and Assari, and boy were both dishes awesome.  The Black had a thicker consistency and more buttery flavor than the Assari (of which was very lighthearted with an easy taste), and also had thinner ramen noodle.  The Black came with a whole soft boiled egg and the Assari a half, both cooked to perfection (the yolk was the perfect gooey consistency with a lightly salty taste).  The chashu was delicate and flavorful, and although not very generous, it hit the spot.  My wife preferred the thicker noodle the Assari came with, but I felt that both the thick and thin noodle were exceptional.  The noodle was not too chewy, not too soft, not too absorbent, not too delicate.  We also had the Takoyaki was also exceptional, and the best I've had since the last time I've been to Tokyo.  The owner/chef was also present to ensure the guests were pleased.
