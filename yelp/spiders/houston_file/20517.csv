Uchi////- Brussels Sprouts: I've heard lots of good comments about this but the fried Brussels was a bit bitter, oily and very salty. I think they overused the caramelized fish sauce (which made the dish different but also killed it, to my taste). Better place to try: Salty Sow Austin or very similar to the taste without the salty: Tiger Den Ramen.
