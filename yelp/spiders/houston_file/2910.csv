JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very good ramen and nice topping choice to add more veggie or seasoned eggs. Tonkasu black was nice and creamy but probably better with the spicy option. Spicy chicken is very good. Missing a star because I still like the ramen at kata robata better. But will definitely come back for downtown lunches.
