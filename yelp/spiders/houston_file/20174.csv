Uchi////Hello Yelpers! I know it's UCHI and is so popular by demand but for some reason the houston location isn't as good as the Austin ones. The service is impeccable and ambiance is very nice but the food as far as flavors isn't as flavorful as the locations in Austin. I gave it 3 tries and I am still not happy. The wagyu sushi lacks that flavor like Uchiko which I was so surprised. I even have $25 GCs and still haven't gone back. Kind of a disappointment. Their food just needs to be consistent like the ones in Austin.
