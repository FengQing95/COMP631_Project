Uchi////Uchi is my favorite Houston restaurant. They are expensive, but completely worth it. Their sushi is always fresh and they have unique dishes. After trying their other branches in Austin and Dallas, this location is the best. They have an intimate atmosphere, excellent service, and amazing food. While they offer hot and cold dishes, we prefer to order off their daily specials (which is printed every day) and look for new seafood we haven't tried. One of the must-have's is their foie gras, it's one of my boyfriends favorite foods and uchi does an amazing job of it.
