Uchi////Needless to say, we got several items off the happy hour menu and a couple off the regular one. The bluefin flight was alright as there was connective tissue in it where I don't expect it. The hama chili and walu walu were both great that we even had seconds. Don't really care for the rolls as the seaweeds were too chewy. Pork belly was a bit too dry as well. The jasmine cream dessert was wonderful!
