Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hello Snooze, please listen to your customers to improve service! The parking lot doesn't have enough spaces which is hard to get to your place on weekdays! Upon arrival the hostess doesn't acknowledge the people coming in at all. They are face of the restaurant the first and last impression. Cmon hostess I'm sure it's pretty easy to smile and have a nice warm greeting when customers walk in. The wait time is about 30-40 Min sometimes longer to get seated. Even though i saw open seating throughout the restaurant including outside seating. Second, the waiter took about 15min for us take our order and the food came out takes about another 30min. Average wait time for everything from checking in and checking out is over 2 hours. I am not sure if the restaurant doesn't have enough help or what but the wait time alone is so long and most people aren't going to wait and they can go somewhere else. If the speed is just a tad bit quicker it can make the difference of the diners experience and most likely to come back! I haven't been back since my first time experience cause the lack of speed and hostess not being prompt and the long wait times. Hopefully Snooze Eatery A.M remedies this situation!
