Kata Robata////It's our favorite restaurant, sushi, Japanese or otherwise, in Houston.  The Umami dinners every month needs to be experienced by every food lover at least once and the tasting menu is as equally satisfying but not as good of a value, without the alcohol pairings.  For the price, it's a much better bargain than much heralded Uchi.
