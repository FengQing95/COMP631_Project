The Pit Room////The Pit Room gets 5 stars for meeting or exceeding all of the things I check when trying a restaurant for the first time. I consider the following items when rating restaurants: facility/location, restrooms, staff, and food. I ordered the 3 meat dinner so I could try several items. I had the brisket, venison sausage, and white-meat chicken along with mac & cheese and charred green beans (special for the day) as my sides. The mac & cheese wasn't outstanding, but everything else really stood out. The staff was efficient but friendly. The location doesn't have enough onsite parking, but there was plenty of curbside parking on the adjacent street. The line was out the door, but they moved everyone through quickly. I would return to The Pit Room if I'm in the Houston area again.
