Baby Barnaby's////I'm extremely disappointed in the service, or lack thereof, at Baby Barnaby's this summer. I just left the restaurant and I honestly don't think our waitress said more than three words to us. "What'll ya have?" That's it! No "hi" or "welcome" when we first sat down. In fact, she stood in front of our table for a second, teasing us with the false hope that she'd finally take our drink order after seven minutes of trying to catch her attention, but then she walked off to chat with another table. Later, she came back, took our order, and left. She didn't stop by to check on us or ask if we needed anything after our food was delivered by the kitchen staff. Nothing. She just ungraciously dropped of the check. Ugh!
