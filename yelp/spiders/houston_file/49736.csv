Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of the Breakfast Spot in the town! It was my first time here but I was blown away and completely satisfied . We ordered avocado Benny (egg benedict on on toasted bagel with mashed avocado) and Pancake Flight (three pancakes of your choice; we got pineapple, chocolate chip, and cinnamon roll). Both were delicious and filling portions (see pic). I would highly recommend it!
