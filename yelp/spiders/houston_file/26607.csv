The Pit Room////Seriously good brisket, very heavily rubbed, strong pepper bark. We hit just after the lunch rush so some disappointment. Ribs were average and dry the beef rib I should have returned, charred and way over cooked with little meat. Chicken was good. Corn sides with some kind of creamed cheese was special, the mustard potato salad was good ,The charro beans average - most Mexican places have better. bbq sauce was very good indeed!  Liked the regular and Jalapeno sausage.  $ 96 for what fits on one tray,, bbq isn't cheap. Buy brisket, best value,  forget ribs and beef bones
