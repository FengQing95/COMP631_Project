Uchi////Thanks for the $200 food poisoning. The service was good, food was tasty, we did not wait as we had made a reservation a month in advance. Was happy until the food poisoning kicked in. Upon researching, we later learning that "walu walu is apparently quite controversial. According to The Kitchn, it's actually been banned in various countries because part of the fish is indigestible to humans and can cause serious gastrointestinal problems." It did cause that. It would responsible if UCHi to ask people when they order it if they have had it before, and make them aware. It never occurred to us there could me something on the menu that could make us so ill.
