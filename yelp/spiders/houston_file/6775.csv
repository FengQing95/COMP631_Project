JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow this place is awesome. We came here after a long day and night in Houston. They don't close until 2 a.m. Â The server had some spot on recommendations for us. We got a variety of appetizers. All were delicious. The server recommended the spicy miso ramen. Wow, hands down the best bowl of soup I've ever eaten. If you haven't eaten here yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. Prices are good. Food is great. Service is spot on. The restaurant has a really hip vibe. Love it. Will be back the next time we are in Houston.
