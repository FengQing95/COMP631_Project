The Pit Room////Voted the #1 BBQ spot by users on Google Reviews and Yelp, we had to try this place! The line was long upon arrival, but they move it pretty fast (about 20-25 minute wait). The thing I liked most about this place is they cook/serve the food in front you upon ordering, and the atmosphere. There's a neighboring building next to The Pit Room called The Patio at The Pit Room where you can eat outside and enjoy that cookout feel. They have servers constantly checking on you at the patio which was real nice. They were very attentive. Fountain drinks and bottle drinks are available. As for the food...delicious! Is The Pit Room the best BBQ in Houston? Hey, I'm just a tourist. But it was really good! I give a thorough walkthrough of this joint at
