Uchi////Horrible customer service! Called in advance to make reservation and they said we had to come instead. Once we got there they said there was a 45 minutes wait, came back 25 minutes later and they still said we had another 45 minutes... So we decided to go to the bar and wait. We ordered drinks and sat down only to be rudely told that we could't sit there minutes later. The seats were not occupied by anyone and they still wanted us to stand with our drinks. This was one of the managers being so rude, the other manager came and said we could stay but we were still blown away by how inconsiderate they were. Once we were sat our waitress did not come greet us for at least 10 minutes and when she was taking our order was very rude when we asked to have the cumber left out of one of the rolls. She said she didn't think the chef would be willing to do that?!?!?! If they are making it from scratch why can't they just leave one ingredient out. We are the ones paying over $150 for dinner we should be able to ask for what we want. As the dinner progressed the waitress started taking away our appetizer before we were finished eating it. We were having such an unfortunate experience there that we asked for a togo box so we could leave. The less rude manager came over and apologized for the seating early, which was nice, but they he made odd remarks about us taking the food home. I am sure it was with his best intentions but he brought us a bag to put it in and said something like this way you won't have to feel awkward. Are we supposed to feel awkward that we are taking our food? We would have preferred to stay and eat it if you weren't so rude in the first place! Overall horrible experience and I will never go back again. Don't waste your money on over priced food that is only subpar.
