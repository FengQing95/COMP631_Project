The Pit Room////Was really excited to have some TX BBQ during my short stay in Houston. The Pit Room had good reviews and not too far from my hotel. It was a windy rainy day, but made it with a table in the main dining area! It wasn't the best spot as everytime someone opened the door, my napkins and such went flying everywhere!
