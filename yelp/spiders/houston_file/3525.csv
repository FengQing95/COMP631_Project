JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Please know that we receive routine inspections by health inspectors from the City of Houston and we have passed those inspections on every occasion. I regret the piece of Saran Wrap that we use to cover our toppings kept in ramekins, such as Brussels Sprouts, tore and fell into the bowl during preparation. That is most likely what happened in this instance.
