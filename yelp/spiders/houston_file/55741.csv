Kata Robata////Overall, I still love the food here.  There has only been two items that were just okay - Oxtail ramen and their lobster macaroni and cheese.  Everything else has been great!  I do hope they update their POS system or change their policy on splitting checks soon, otherwise, I may have to keep my parties small during lunch.
