Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Waitress was great! Hostess was so incredibly rude this past Friday night. Talked to me & my party like we were dumb. We waited almost an hour just to get in just to be sat at 1 of 2 tables that were open when we first came in. I asked if it was because someone was a no show that's why we were finally able to get the vacant table & she replied "clearly yes someone didn't show up so we could seat you now, that's how it works". The 2nd vacant table was also open the from the moment we walked in until we left as well.
