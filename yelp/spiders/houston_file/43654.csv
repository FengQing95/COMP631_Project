Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Since I have a rare chocolate intolerance, I was limited to macarons - which is usually never, ever a bad thing. Ordered pistachio and "the pink one" which I can't remember and after eating still couldn't make out the flavor. It was bad. Not awful, just bad - cakey and overly sweet. Common Bond's version of the delicate French confection is everything but, and oh-so Americanized (read: bigger! sweeter!)
