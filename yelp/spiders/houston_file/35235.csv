Local Foods////We weren't far from local foods so we popped in to check it out.  I love portabella mushrooms so that's what I opted for. Hubby got the shrimp and crab meat sandwich. He had NO complaints.  Me I had a couple. My bread was toasted but just a little too much for me, but that's just my preference. Next time I'll remember to ask for lightly toasted. Second it was spicy. I believe that it came from the aioli but I'm not sure because the ingredients did not list anything spicy. Third, the description said it had some pecans (sorry I don't remember the exact wording on the menu) never tasted them. I tasted the mushroom, onions, salad (believe it had mint in the mix, yuck made it taste funny). Now the sides I had were the potato salad, and pasta salad.  Potato salad was delicious could have used more, pasta salad just as good, good Greek flavor, beware the  kalamata olives have the pit in them so do be careful taking big bites. You don't want to chip those pretty teeth!
