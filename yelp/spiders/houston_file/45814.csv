Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Aside from the parking, I really liked the ambiance here. We came here for desserts and coffee. Plenty of good options to choose from and an open display to see. I also liked a few of their menu options like their soft scrambled eggs. Overall, a neat little spot for a cup of coffee, croissant, macaroons, and/or lunch.
