JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went there visiting from out of town and happened upon their "soft" opening night. Food quality was good and will certainly be able to hold its own as a legitimate ramen establishment. Service was more of a mix bag and I think our server was totally out of his element. I don't think he had alot of experience with ramen as some food names were unclear to him as to what they were. We did have some grace as it was a new opening and hopefully their service and systems will improve. We waited longer than we should have for our food and not because of the kitchen...We saw our bowls sitting there for a long time to the point of getting cool.
