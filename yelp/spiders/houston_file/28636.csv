The Pit Room////Great place to grab some good barbecue. My typical go-to is the 3 meat plate. Brisket (of course), ribs and turkey. I'm typically not going to get turkey when I go to a barbecue place but theirs is legitimately the best I've had. On the weekends they do the beef rib. It's on the expensive side but you have to get it. It's enough for 2 to share with some Mac-n-cheese.
