JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Cameron - Thanks for the great review! Yes, the Spicy Chicken Ramen is a crowd favorite for sure. I think the flavor of our chicken broth isn't quite so rich as the pork broth, which lets the spiciness emerge a bit more. Thank you for your patronage and we look forward to seeing you again soon!
