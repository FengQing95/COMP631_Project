Kata Robata////We walked in here on a Saturday evening, while happy hour was going on. Surprisingly, it wasn't as crowded as I had expected to be, but that might have been because it was early evening and not towards the end of happy hour (which is 4-7 on Mondays-Saturdays, by the way). We were greeted by an angry host and seated at a nice booth table. Our server was attentive, especially since we didn't even realize all the times are water was being filled.
