Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Servers were nice, until one of the two servers blamed my friend for changing her order. We ordered Bosscat Burger but a doughnut burger came out so we told our server that the food came out wrong. As it was so loud inside, I would've understood if the server apologized right away but instead she rolled her eyes, asking "You ordered doughnut burger, right??" We were very startled by the way she reacted. Why would we even say that we ordered something else if the food we ordered came out right? It was a very unpleasant experience and she repeated herself again at the end when we asked for the check. "I swear you guys ordered doughnut burger." ... I just don't know what to say anymore.
