Uchi////I enjoyed Uchi for a dining experience, but it's not really sushi, so don't go here with the hope of having some great sushi. Do go for the large selection of sake and the interesting food combinations and the twist on traditional sushi and Japanese food. It is worth trying if you enjoy interesting food experiences and are in the mood for something off the beaten path.
