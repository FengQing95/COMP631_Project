Uchi////We love love love trying new sushi places in the city, this place didn't disappoint. It is definitely on the pricy end, but the quality of food matches it. The only downside is that the serving sizes are pretty small, but if you get a few dishes between a couple people everyone can try different things. They definitely do more modern, interesting sushi mashups but it was fun to try!
