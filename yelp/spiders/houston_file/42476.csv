Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm also a huge fan of the space - huge windows which bring in lots of natural light, and lots of community seating on antique pieces of furniture. Quite an eclectic mix, just like their staff. Supposedly the entire team comes from a variety of backgrounds and geographical locations, where they were all the best at what they did. And they came together to do what they wanted most.
