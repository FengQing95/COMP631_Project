The Pit Room////What a great experience for people wanting some Houston bbq. It's in Montrose, so we did a little tour of the historic downtown Houston and stopped here around 3pm on a Saturday for lunch. Man, it was packed even for a late lunch! Great ambiance with country music playing, and it's very efficient because you walk down the counter and your dish is prepared for you in front of your eyes. The only waiting is when you walk in to get to the counter. I ordered the 1 meat Dinner with Venison, Elote, and Charred Okra (the speciality item). The Venison was very flavorful and there was a lot on the plate. Wasn't super moist, but I haven't tasted Venison often so I'm not sure if that's normal. The elote was good, but the serving wasn't very big and I will have to ask for more cheese on it next time because I like it creamier (the great thing about this place is that they prepare the food in front of your eyes, so if you want more sauce of something, you can just ask). The charred okra was perfection!! Love the texture of it. The rest of the table loved their brisket & the charro beans.
