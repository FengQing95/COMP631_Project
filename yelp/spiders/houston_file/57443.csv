Kata Robata////Food: 4/5: I felt like the cold and hot dishes were the winners. The Nigiris that we had were okay. I hated how it felt like it was falling a part so easily. The eel, was slightly burnt. Felt like presentation overall of the nigiris fell flat. Favorites were the Texas Wagyu Sando and the Fresh Ceviche. The Uni King Crab could of been better of the crab didnt taste so frozen.
