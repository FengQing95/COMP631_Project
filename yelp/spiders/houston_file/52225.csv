Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////No complaints other than parking--and that's in their control. Met some friends after a long shift for breakfast and beverages. I got a regular bloody and a spicy bloody--both made with the housemade bloody mix that is on par and a lil skewer for decor. Had a hard time deciding on my meal considering alllll the options. Chose the breakfast pot pie--puff pastry that was perfectly fluffy and crispy topped with sausage gravy and a fried egg--served with us browns on the side. De-li-cious. Server was great and the handheld self checkout gig at the table was convenient. We were able to split the bill however we wanted to without bugging our server. Get their before 9 to beat the weekday morning rush.
