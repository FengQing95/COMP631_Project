Local Foods////Local Foods continues to be my favorite sandwich/soup/salad spot of all time, only rivaled by the Westheimer Central Market's sandwich counter. I wanted to write an update about the crunchy chicken sandwich. The first time I tried it, I was disappointed because the chicken comes cold and I am a hot sandwich kind of person. I was at the restaurant recently and on a whim asked if I could try the crunchy chicken hot instead of cold and to my delight, I could! This was such a game changer. Suddenly the sandwich came together for me. The warm breaded chicken with the tangy buttermilk ranch, potato chip crunch, and vinegary pickles all in one bite was a texture/flavor combo that's hard to beat. It reminded me of M&M grills famous loaded cheeseburger (juicy patty with fried onions, jalape√±os, and ranch dressing)...but its fancier, yuppier, healthier cousin. I'm excited to have another go to sandwich to add to my rotation here!
