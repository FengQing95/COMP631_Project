JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////H Town can be proud of this ramen spot! To be honest, this ramen scene is kind of new for me, but I am already a big fan! There is a very interesting option to take for free as much garlic as you want. But seriously, how much the one can get? I am planning on tasting their sides, which definitely look fabulous. The only negative point is that the restaurant is so tiny. I would be happy if it gets more spacious! The same about the parking.
