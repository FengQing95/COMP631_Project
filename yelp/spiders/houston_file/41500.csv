Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My visit to common bond was a very impulsive one. My brother and I were on our way to a different breakfast restaurant, but saw Common Bond packed so we decided to give it a try. First impression as we walked in was new age and Kind of pretentious, however all of the workers were extreme nice and patient. My brother ordered the chicken torta and I ordered the pork belly. Both dishes were amazing! The pork belly was very rich and was like nothing I have had before. I alway ordered their signature pastry. I don't remember what it's called, but it's an extra buttery and sugary croissant, and it is to die for. The coffee is delicious too and perfectly roasted. All in all the atmosphere is incredible along with the staff and food. Common Bond is a must.
