JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen is by no means a cheap food, and JINYA is no exception. Be prepared to spend at the very least 10 dollars on a bowl of noodles, with some going up to 13 dollars. Personally, I go for the Tonkotsu Black or Cha Cha Cha (Garlic) ramen bowls during my visits. The broth is always decently flavorful with a good amount of fat, and satisfies that crave for a rich, porky experience that is a hot bowl of ramen. One gripe I have with JINYA is that their eggs are often slightly overcooked, which is a huge no-no for any ramen shop. Overall, though, JINYA doesn't offer much to distinguish itself from other similarly priced ramen shops you'd find at other metropolitan cities in America. But then again, most of us are searching for that prototypical bowl of ramen when we come to a place like JINYA, and they deliver a relatively satisfying meal.
