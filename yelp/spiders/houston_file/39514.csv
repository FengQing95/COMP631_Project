Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We made a reservation to be safe but not sure we needed it. It was fairly busy but the place is enormous. You can choose your preferred atmosphere - fairly quiet in the back, loud and busy in the bar, and moderate at the front tables where we sat. They have a gorgeous private whiskey room that would be great for a party of 12-18. Â
