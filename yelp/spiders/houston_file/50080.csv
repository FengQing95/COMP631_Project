Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is my favorite breakfast place. It upsets me that they close at 2 pm because I'll always be craving their food late at night. I would go here more often if the wait time wasn't so long. People wait on average 1-2 hours for a table. I love food, but not enough to wait that long. I hear they're opening up a second location which would really help with the line situation.
