Baby Barnaby's////The migas were yummy (delicious tomatoes, onions, peppers in the eggs, which were cooked perfectly!), but it's odd they don't serve it with tortillas. I guess that's because they know where their specialties lie: they don't make tortillas. The potatoes were DELICIOUS AF though! (basically, they're fried chunks of glory)
