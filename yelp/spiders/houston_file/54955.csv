Kata Robata////My brother took me here for my birthday. And can I say love!!! The lobster and Mac is sooo delicious and creamy! Had to take the little left over we had. The miso spicy ramen was also great large portion and tasty! Salty just the way I liked it! Definitely and absolutely will be returning!
