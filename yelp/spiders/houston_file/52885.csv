Kata Robata////This is such a neat place! I've heard raving reviews about this place, but never had the chance to seek this place out until about a weekend ago. My favorite of all favorites was probably the Miso Lobster Macaroni! It was DELICIOUS. The dish was cooked to perfection & wasn't too too heavy-- keeping in mind that it is a cheese dish. Among that item, my friends & I also ordered King Crab Spoons, Tofu with Mixed Mushrooms and the Popcorn Baby Crab Salad.
