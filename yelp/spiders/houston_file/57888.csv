Kata Robata////The surprise, however, came after when all 4 of us got severe food poisoning. Considering it was from a place established (and expensive) Kata Robata, where the fish typically tastes quite fresh, I was extremely surprised and disappointed. There's no discerning if it was just something in the fish, or if it hadn't been kept at the proper temperature, or if it was due to sanitation issues at Kata Robata, but during COVID, the possibility of contracting any type of illness from food (and paying 60$ to do so), isn't worth the risk of dining here again and figuring it out. Because this place really has impressed me in the past, I'd be willing to visit again later on, but I would really recommend staying away for the time being.
