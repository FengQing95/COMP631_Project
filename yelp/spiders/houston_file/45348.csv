Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here for a dinner late one night and there were not a lot of people. The service was quick and the servers were all lovely. I didn't realize the pizza (I forgot the exact name) I had ordered actually had bacon on it, and I am a vegetarian. I asked the waiter and he said he could replace it with a vegetarian pizza (tomato + mozzarella) and I said that was fine. The owner/manager was also concerned and came over to see if I would like them to remake my original pizza without the bacon, but they had already started making the tomato one. Nonetheless, the tomato one was delicious and I was so touched that the owner came over to make sure I was enjoying my food.
