Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here as a last minute decision bc Seasons 52 had an hour wait and it was the best decision! We had a ladies night out for quick drinks and appetizers before an event so we were on a time crunch and we were in and out within an hour on a Friday night! Amazing food and service! Our waitress Jaclyn was awesome and the servers as well were extremely friendly, prompt, and treated us amazingly! Atmosphere was great and food was good too! We enjoyed the chicken Bourbon flatbread, pulled pork hush puppies and parmesan crusted meatloaf. Would highly recommend and will definitely go back because we enjoyed it!
