Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////SERVICE: The only reason I didn't give the joint the full amount of stars. It's a 5-star for the food ... but the service is just so-so at best. They are always ridiculously busy (prepare to wait 1.5 hours on the weekend) so I think they need to hire a server or 2 more to even out the busy times!
