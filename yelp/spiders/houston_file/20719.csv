Uchi////I loved the ham and eggs roll.  The brussel sprouts are surprisingly delicious.  Do take advantage of their happy hour if you're unsure of what to order - and can get a tasting of a lot of items on a discount.  The fried milk is just something you have to order to at least try once.  The quality of the ingredients really makes this restaurant good.
