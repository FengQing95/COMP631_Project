JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen here is certainly THE BEST I ever had in my life. I am extremely happy at the fact I went with the cha cha cha. It had the PERFECT ratio of meat, noodles, and bean sprouts. This rarely ever happens in my experience noodle places. The flavor of the fish and pork broth with garlic was impeccable. To be honest I'm still thinking about this ramen the day after.
