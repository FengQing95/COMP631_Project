Local Foods////I've been here a few times now and Local is definitely one of my new favorite sandwich places. I don't normally go out of my way to buy sandwiches (I prefer making them myself, and if I spend money on food it's for something I can't make). Regardless, Local's offerings are a bit out of my skillset so I was excited to try the Crunchy Chicken sandwich here.
