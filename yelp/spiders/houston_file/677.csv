JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen.  The food was almost as good as Tiger Den.   The service was the only part that needed a bit of work... I don't mind flamboyance but our waiter was so deliberate with his aggressiveness.  Even with this turn off. We still loved our time.  Be prepared to wait... On a Saturday we waited 45 minutes... We took our pager they gave us over to Woosters and had a craft cocktail while we waited... It's like a block away... I don't mind waiting for quality ... I can't wait to bring my friends. I have got to mention the male bartender... So friendly and knowledgeable!
