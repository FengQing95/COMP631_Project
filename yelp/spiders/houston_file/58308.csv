Baby Barnaby's////Delicious! Every time I have visitors in town I take them here for breakfast. The menu offers standard breakfast items like eggs and bacon, but also more adventurous items such as chicken apple sausage and green eggs. The fresh squeezed juices are also amazing, especially after a late night.
