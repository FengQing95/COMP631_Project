JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friends and I were hella craving ramen so we settled on Jinya for the night and were promptly seated when we arrived. It is absolutely bustling with people and the dim lighting kind of creates a hip and moody ambience. Right off the bat we ordered the spicy creamy shrimp tempura (which isn't spicy, but was still the highlight of my experience) and our waitress suggested the crispy chicken which was less than appetizing in my opinion. She compared it to popcorn chicken but its rubbery texture and consistency with the occasional ligament/cartilage chew just turned me off the dish. I had the tonkotsu spicy with an added seasoned egg but was kind of underwhelmed by it all. The egg literally tasted like...a boiled egg. Seasoned where? The browning of the egg? Absolutely no notes of soy, mirin, sugar, etc. The broth was overly salty and the tonkotsu was far from plentiful. For the price of a bowl here, you'd expect the most bang for your buck but that's not really the case here. The rating I provided stems mostly from the service seeing as the server was attentive to our table and frequently checked up on us. I'll have to check up on their other locations and see if I can find a better experience.
