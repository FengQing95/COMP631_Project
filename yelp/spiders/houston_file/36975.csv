Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food- came here to try Houston Restaurant Weeks menu and it was amazing. Now we don't take photos of our food (blah I know) because we actually chose to scarf and enjoy it...and enjoy it we did lol. Fried oysters were bomb, my husband got the tuna wraps, looked amazing and he loved it. Red snapper was nice and light, Korean short ribs were so filling and simply delicious. The desserts, omg where do I begin? Brownie + PB + Bacon is the best thing ever!!! Husband also had one of their signature whiskey cocktails and said it was legit.
