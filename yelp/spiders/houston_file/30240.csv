The Pit Room////My husband and I tried this spot while visiting from the DMV. Was not expecting it to be so casual but it is a Pit so I should have known better. Since we had so many places to try we shared a 3 meat meal of Chicken, Pulled Pork and Pork Ribs with potato salad and green beans. Unfortunately they were out of brisket :( Everything was delicious but the green beans hands down were our favorite. I don't know what type of seasoning wizardry they used but it was delicious. I wanted to give it 5 stars but it's pretty cramped inside and with a line I just felt like its too close for comfort.
