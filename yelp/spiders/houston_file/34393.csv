Local Foods////My husband and I ate lunch with our baby last week. They had a special delicious vegan bowl that we both enjoyed and he really liked his black bean burger - neither of us are vegetarian/vegan so this speaks volumes! The cookie did not disappoint. Highly recommend for lunch and we will surely be back!
