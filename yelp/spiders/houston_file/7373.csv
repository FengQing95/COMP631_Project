JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A ramen place that actually introduces new patrons as they enter, really authentic vibe, lots of ramen options - they even have a vegan ramen!! I have only had Ramen 3 times in life and this place is my second favorite after New York - so that's probably a good thing. I really enjoyed the spicy pork ramen with an egg. The staff was really nice - but they were busy, and there was a wait to get seated. They stay open late which is always a perk! I liked the atmosphere - authentic with community tables, the option of individual tables, and bar seating. I'd definitely go back!
