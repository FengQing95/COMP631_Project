Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is literally the first time I've left a review for any business ever, because I was appalled at the service and how I was treated today as a 9 months pregnant woman.  I went to meet two friends for brunch, and the place was very crowded with a long line.  I was concerned about not being able to find a table that I could sit at comfortably indoors without  aggravating my back pain, so I decided to find a table before ordering.  My friend held the table while I went to look at the menu, and he was asked to get up since he hadn't ordered and when he explained I was pregnant, one of the staff basically said it doesn't matter.  I went over there and asked if we could hold it given my condition, and she said the policies apply to everyone with no exceptions.  She pointed to a chair crammed at the bar and said I could wait there temporarily if I wanted, but obviously we would've had to stand around waiting for a table if one didn't open up after we'd ordered at the register.  So after being forced to leave the table, we ordered our food and no indoor table was available, so we had to sit outside in the heat.  I've NEVER been treated like this during my pregnancy - every other restaurant, coffee shop, grocery store etc. has been courteous to my needs (and hopefully to the needs of other pregnant women).  Where was the human decency and kindness?  Would allowing a pregnant woman a comfortable table to eat at have inconvenienced the restaurant that much?  Not only that, but this treatment and failure to accommodate my condition was likely illegal.  I will NEVER go back to eat there and plan to report this ADA violation to the Department of Justice.  And irrespective of the legality, a restaurant that cares about its customers just doesn't treat a pregnant woman like that.
