Kata Robata////Kata is simply delish. If you've never been, you're missing out. One of my favorite places for sushi. Your taste buds would kick into high gear and quite the mouthgasm! Love the bone marrow but they ran out so I practically ordered everything else! Most definitely always order the king crab & uni! Will melt in your mouth! Scallops and foie gras' always a winner in my book. Do yourself a favor, and just indulge! My mouth is watering just thinking about it, might have to come back soon!!
