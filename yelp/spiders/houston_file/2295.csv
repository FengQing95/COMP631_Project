JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here for lunch with coworkers. We arrived at 11:45 and were happy to see no wait.  I ordered the spicy chicken ramen. It was pretty good...not as much flavor as I'd like and kinda salty.  They use chicken thighs for this soup. We also ordered the tempura brussel sprouts, which were also tasty but in desperate need of a dipping sauce of some sort. I doubt this place will pop up in my head as the place to go for dinner on a random night,  but I do intend on going back with my husband.
