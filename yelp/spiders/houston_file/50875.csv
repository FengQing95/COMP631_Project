Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////a possible reason that just dawned on me, might be that servers tend to take more breaks and be less attentive when there are fewer customers.  on the other hand, with fewer tickets the cooks can turn almost any order out in under 5 minutes.  the irony is that since the social distancing and reduced capacity requirements have been imposed, the restaurant isn't as busy and this is encourages servers (who are used to the cooks taking over 15 minutes per order under normal busy conditions) to go on break/smoke/etc ... while my food goes stale on the counter.
