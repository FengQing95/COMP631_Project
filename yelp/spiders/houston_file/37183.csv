Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Have been wanting to come here for quite some time. Made it in the middle of the day when everything else is closed for lunch or dinner because the 3 to 5 timeline is pretty slim around Highland Village Kirby etc. me and my girlfriends have had the most amazing service from Miss Jackie! She is going to give you a tour if you want it has amazing stories about the history and development of this restaurant. So attentive and wonderful I haven't had service like this in a long time! In addition Mark came along and added to the wonderful experience! He is an absolute delight what is happening here is awesome service a real history and not a pop-up restaurant from a whiskey and beer lover. Â And by the way the food is fantastic and we just got started exploring the menu. Definitely recommend making a trip here! It's worth your time.
