Uchi////Foie gras - we had this dish last and I think it topped the whole dining experience well. The waitr told us to close our eyes when we eat the whole thing in one bite. It was so good. Like this was not what I was expecting. For me, I would described the taste like as if I was eating a juicy thick eel with parts of a pork belly mixed in it. It was really really good. I'm definitely coming back to eat more of this dish.
