JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel like I give out a lot of 5 star reviews like drunk people give out likes on IG, but JINYA was SO DAMN GOOD! I guess it pays off that I typically do my hw before trying a new place -Â especially when we're craving something specific. Parking next door at the cramped 24 lot was tricky, but coming from LA it really wasn't bad at all. The crowd out front was a little intimidating, but our wait was estimated to be about 40 mins. Not bad at all, perfect time enough to grab a beer at the Italian place adjacent to JINYA.
