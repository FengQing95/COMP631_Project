JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my go to place for ramen! As someone who doesn't eat pork, it is really hard to find good ramen which doesn't use pork broth. However, Jinya has the widest variety of non-pork ramen which includes chicken options as well as vegetarian options. I always have their Spicy Chicken Ramen which is definitely a blessing on cold nights and rainy days! The portion size is huge; I always leave feeling stuffed. The ramen is spicy enough to add flavor without taking away from the rest of the tastes! Their octopus ball is another recommended The aesthetic is nice for a nice romantic dinner or even hangout with friends. Prices are good as well! Only complaint I have is the long wait time --waited around 45 mins both times I went although it was the weekend so it is understandable. Make sure if you go in a group of 4 or more people that you ask for a booth or a personal table. Otherwise you would end up sitting at a communal table in the middle, and if you end up sitting in a row (instead of facing each other) then it is difficult to talk which is what happened to us the first time. Â We didn't know the two options, and trust me a personal table is well worth the extra 10-15 minutes wait for large groups!
