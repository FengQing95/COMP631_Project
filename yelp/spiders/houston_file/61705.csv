Baby Barnaby's////- Fruit Bowl: came with 2 strawberries, melon balls, blueberries, thin slices of orange with peel, and tiny chunks of pineapple. The quality and freshness of the fruit were not that great. It felt like this has been sitting for a while since the fruits on the bottom were soaked in water.
