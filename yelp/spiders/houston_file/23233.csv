Uchi////- Third...the dessert. This all needs deep prayer. The brown butter financier is a small narrow line of cake with sauces around it. I was expecting a filling piece of cake, but instead I got a Costco sample size of a cake, with tea sauce and peach sauce which both needed sugar. We also got the fried milk & the dish itself had minimal involvement with fried milk. It was 20% fried milk which was 4-5 small balls of fried dough with a milk sauce in the middle and 80% chocolate meringue. Why not call it Chocolate Meringue because the fried milk was garnish in comparison to the rest of the dessert.
