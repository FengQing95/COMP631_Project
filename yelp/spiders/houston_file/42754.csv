Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came in 30 minutes before closing time so unfortunately there were barely any pastries left. That didn't phase my judgement on my review, because although there were only a variety of macarons and a couple of cheesecakes left on the shelf, I exited the building as a satisfied customer.
