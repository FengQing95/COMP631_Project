JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: 3.5/5 I'm not sure if the price was equivalent to the taste of the ramen. We had the spicy tonkotsu ramen and the tonkotsu black. The spicy ramen wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, and I asked for "hot". The chasu pork was very good, it was full of flavor with the perfect amount of fat and meat. Wish it came with a soft boiled egg. The black ramen was full of flavor (a bit salty). The egg was cooked great! The noodles for this one was thinner than the spicy ramen, which I'm not sure I liked bc I felt like I was getting less.
