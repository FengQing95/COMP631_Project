JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken ramen as well as the miso ramen they have beside the regular tonkotsu. They do have the combos in which you get 1 ramen bowl and 1 rice bowls with a very reasonable price. If you have stomach for it, please please please order the rice bowl. It is so dang good!
