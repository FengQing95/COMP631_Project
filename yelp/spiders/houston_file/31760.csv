Local Foods////Tasty, healthy, hip joint.  The crispy chicken sandwich was delicious and the sides (quinoa especially) are also very unique and full of flavor.  I enjoyed the atmosphere as well and you could tell everyone was loving their food; great place for a professional Friday lunch. Prices are a little high but not unreasonable being that portions are generous.
