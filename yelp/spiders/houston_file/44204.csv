Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond can get pretty busy at times and sell out of daily breads, but workers move fast and will try quickly to have you on your way. My only gripe with the place is that, the breads may be sitting around for awhile and are not piping hot and fresh out of the oven.
