Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I tried calling so I could get some answers but, there is no phone number just an email. So I sent an email explaining about the raw cookie and if that is something they do on purpose. I can't imagine they do but you never know I also wanted to clear up our confusion on the pastries cooling on the racks. Was they being baked for tomorrow? And if so why? Or are they fake pasties being moved from oven to rack for visual effect. My email went un-replied both times.
