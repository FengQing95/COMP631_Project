Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On a positive note, my boyfriend really enjoyed his chocolate chip cookie. It was ranked as one of his top 10 chocolate chip cookies. Additionally, we arrived around 11 am and there was a small line that did go slightly out of the door, but as other reviewers mentioned, the line went quickly. Also the environment was aesthetically pleasing because of all of the open windows, but I did not appreciate how crowded the tables were next to each other. Too close for my comfort.
