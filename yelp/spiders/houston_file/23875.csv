Uchi////What an excellent venue! My friends and I made a reservation and were seated shortly after opening. That being said, do not waste time NOT making a reservation, because this place was popular--and for good reason! The food was high quality, the service was impeccable, and the evening was one for the memory books. Will definitely be back!
