Uchi////First time we were there, the experience was amazing! The food was awesome! Service, by Michael, wonderful! It's incredible how they can make the most simplest dish into a mouth full of heaven. Brussels spouts so good! Anything that has pork - to DIE FOR!!! Tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection. All the sushi rolls...don't even think about using soy sauce and wasabi! Eat the damn thing the way the chef intended and appreciate every morsel of each bite. Heaven! Only down side, price and the wait but then you get what you pay for. So worth the wait and price. Advice- make reservations and it's good for 2-4 people and share the dishes so you can try a lot of dishes. And don't forget to order the fried milk...yummmmmm
