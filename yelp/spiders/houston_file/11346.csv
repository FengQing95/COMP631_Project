JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////During busy hours such as lunch on weekends and dinner time, it does get loud and can be awhile of a wait but I've always waited because the food is worth the wait! Going with small groups of 4-5 people is good but going with large groups of 6 or more is going to be crowded especially since their seating isn't all that great. Great for couples though since there are small tables just for individuals!
