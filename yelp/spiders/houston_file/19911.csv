Uchi////This Uchi is just like the original in Austin. I had no idea they had an Uchi in Houston until I was there on business and went with coworkers. We ended up wanting sushi and someone brought us here. I was confused for a moment until I was told this was operated by the one in Austin. Valet was quick and easy. We just asked them to keep the sushi coming and we were never disappointed. Of course we had bubbles to start and then switched to infused sake. Solid solid solid option. Do go if you have the chance.
