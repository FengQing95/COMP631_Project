Kata Robata////The only bad thing we encounter that night was the hostesses. Can you be any more aggrogant and sour faced?! They were not nice at all. And we had reservations! We had asked for an extra chair for my little niece but they refused to give us one. Our waitor was super nice. He let us have an extra chair but the hostess were bitxhing n complaining about it. Seriously? Really?? One chair does not take up that much real estate. Please change your attitude. You are a HOSTESS. You're front of the house. Be nice and kind for goodness sake!
