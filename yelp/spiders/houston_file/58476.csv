Baby Barnaby's////Service: Our waiter was great! He was very accommodating and when they brought out the wrong food, he apologized and brought the wrong food straight back to the kitchen without question and told us that the food would be out in a few minutes. The host was a little more rude to us especially for us being first timers here, and we did not know exactly where to go or what to do. Overall good service though.
