Baby Barnaby's////Great service by Jose..and a great breakfast to start our day out in Houston.  Fresh squeezed OJ and all the breakfast items (we ended up sharing it was all so good) were great!  A nice homey comfortable atmosphere we didn't want to leave!  I'll be back on the next visit to Houston!
