Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////You're very specific on your critiques. I can't help but wonder if you're an industry guy. You sound like you know your way around the kitchen pretty well. It would be fantastic if you would show us some pointers. You're always welcomed in our house to show us a thing or two about cooking. Perhaps, we'll get the honor of dining at your restaurant one day.
