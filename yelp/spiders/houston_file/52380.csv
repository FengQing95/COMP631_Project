Kata Robata////Everything my girlfriend and I had was outstanding.  We ordered 3 starters to kick off our dinner.  We had the braised pork belly, hamachi sashimi with olive oil and sliced fresh jalapenos, and also the lobster Macaroni and cheese.  All three were delicious but I especially enjoyed the hamachi.  It was outstanding but at $14 for 6 paper thin slices of fish with a sliver of jalapeno on top of each a bit much.  From there we proceeded to order some fresh nigiri and a few sushi rolls.  All of which, were very good.  The fish was all fresh and the salmon belly was to die for.  I really like that they have fresh wasabi upon request also.  Our server was kind enough to not charge us the $7 bucks they normally do for the fresh wasabi.  That was a definite bonus but $7 bucks is excessive anyway.
