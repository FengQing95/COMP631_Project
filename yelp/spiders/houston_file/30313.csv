The Pit Room////Food - The only thing I got was a sliced brisket sandwich. Onions, pickles, and jalapenos on the side. Very good, but didn't blow my socks off or anything - don't get me wrong though, still very good. I prefer moist brisket, none of that lean stuff for me. I got a mix of both, so the half of the sandwich that had the moist fatty slices was soo good. Piled all my onions onto the sandwich, ended up with a great contrast on textures. And the pickles were very nicely pickled and had a little heat to them. The BBQ sauce was really good - slightly peppery, sweet and tangy, great accompaniment. Â
