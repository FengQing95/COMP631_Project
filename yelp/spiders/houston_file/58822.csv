Baby Barnaby's////We each got something different, I got the Breakfast Tacos with potatoes and fresh fruit. It normally comes with black beans but not a big fan so he gave me fruit instead at no extra charge! Soo nice. Anyways, everything was delicious and very fresh. The best part was that is was so reasonable...all of that for only $6.50-holy moly.
