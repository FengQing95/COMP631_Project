Kata Robata////I've been eating here about once a week, for the last 4 years. My Inner fat kid is always happy, & I always order the same-ish dishes: foie gras chawanmushi, shrimp sashimi, toro sashimi, foie gras & scallop, scallop sashimi, & red bean ice cream. Without fail, it's always fresh and delicious
