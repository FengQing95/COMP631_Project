Uchi////When we entered in, I was overwhelmed with the smell that I knew I was going to get hungry soon.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by Dan, David and Dale (which I will now refer them as Triple D). I cannot stress to you all enough that these guys were awesome...their knowledge of the menu, their personalities and just overall great guys made this experience even better.  Being first timers, we were given sooo many options of what to try and we def. took into consideration of what they said.  Uchi offers so many different types of sushi etc etc that the flavors were amazing.  Triple Ds knowledge of all of the things we ordered and telling us how and what to expect in every bite... I was amazed.  We got sake as well from the Happy Hour menu and loved the cold sake and how it is served in a box
