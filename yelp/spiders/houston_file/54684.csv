Kata Robata////I came here for lunch with coworkers and their lunch specials are delicious and much more affordable! Myself and two other coworkers ordered the kobe beef bento box for $15 and my other coworkers ordered the chirashi for $20. I don't like raw sushi so I'm glad I didn't order the chirashi. The kobe beef bento lunch special is a much better value than the kobe beef skewers at dinner. You get much more food and it's cheaper!
