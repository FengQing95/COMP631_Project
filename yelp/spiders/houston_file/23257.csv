Uchi////Exactly five years later we decided to come to the restaurant for a second time. This place should have shut down a long time ago with competitors like KUU, Nobu and Roka Akor I don't understand why people keep coming here. Food was bla, service was stinky literally our waiter stank, price is ridiculous, portions are tiny, wait times are over 30 mins per order and the place is so freaking loud you'd think you were at a club! Will not be coming back...
