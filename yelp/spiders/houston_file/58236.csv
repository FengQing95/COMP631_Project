Kata Robata////It is quite pricey here, but the food quality is well worth it. It's a great spot for a date night or a special occasion. You will most definitely not be disappointed! My only very minor criticism is that it was quite chilly inside the restaurant - so make sure to bring a sweater and your appetite because it'll be a meal you'll never forget!
