Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Update: Getting dangerously close to being a novel instead of a review, but I was floored by the customer service during my most recent visit. I came in ~2 PM with the intention of shoving one of their delicious mudslide cookies in my mouth, but they hadn't put them out yet. An employee told me that when they get too slammed, the timing of their baked goods gets thrown off. As I was enjoying my eclair, the aforementioned employee stopped by to inform me that the cookies were ready! She brought me one and said I could skip the line and just pay at the bar. Excellent customer service. Â Amazing cookie, per ushe.
