JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Waited 1.5 hrs to sit after we were told 45 mins when we checked in. I don't mind waiting if the restaurant is busy.  But when I see 5...yes 5 two person tables empty. For at least 30 mins while I'm waiting, that's just poor service. Some bullshite about the fryer being down and they could not sit new parties.  Guess what, I came here for ramen, not chicken McNuggets. Busy I can tolerate, Incompetence I cannot.  Last time I'll come here. Oh then there's the left over noodle on my spoon when we finally sat down. See picture. WTF??
