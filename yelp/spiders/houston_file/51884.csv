Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've always had an eye for spotting out the best food spots wherever I am. So when I visited Houston this summer, I knew this place would be a hit. Cozy vibe, great staff, & when I tasted the Shrimp and grits my foodie heart went into heaven! I got it fully loaded with my eggs scrambled & did not disappoint! Their specialty pancakes are to die for & I love that there's healthier options to choose from. So when my husband & I visited again a few months later, we had to stop by again! Highly recommended.
