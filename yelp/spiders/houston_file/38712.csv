Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a flight of Scotch that came with a dropper of water, so it was fun to experiment there. Also ordered a pale wheat beer which was light, crisp and delicious. The service was incredible, my water glass never reached half full, our server was funny and helpful and we had a manager stop by. The service was wonderful overall. The DJ was spinning a lot of really fun music too. We definitely enjoyed our evening and look forward to coming back when we're in town. Great restaurant!
