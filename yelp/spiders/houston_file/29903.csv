The Pit Room////I ordered their 3 meat plate which also came with 2 sides. I had chicken, ribs and brisket with potato salad and mac and cheese. I found that the food was excellent and prepared well. The ribs were tender, as well as the chicken. Their brisket was on point also. I enjoyed the potato salad ans the mac and cheese.
