Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here for a friend's birthday dinner.  The food and service was really good.  However, it was REALLY loud and difficult to hold a basic conversation with the people I was sitting next to.  The space is very long and open with lots of hard surfaces.  They may want to add some sort of sound absorption materials to help control noise.
