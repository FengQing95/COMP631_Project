Uchi////We had 3 people in our group and ended up splitting every dish. Don't expect to get everything you order all at once. We placed our orders and only one dish came out at a time. This seems clever of them since the portions are small and you are waiting between dishes so you may end up spending more since you have time to digest and think about your next order. It is made for sharing and if you're extremely hungry and impatient this is not the place for you.
