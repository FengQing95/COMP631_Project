Kata Robata////I've now been for what feels like the 1000th time and it's still delicious. Kata Robata is so consistent with their dishes. I have never had a bad dish here. Right now they have a seasonal dish, I believe it was the Alaskan king crab dish. It was out of this world. The shumai is unbelievably flavorful as well.
