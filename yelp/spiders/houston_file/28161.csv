The Pit Room////The brisket was SO good. It was flavorful and lean and had a nice thin pepper coating unlike Killen's where the pepper overpowers the meat. The pork jalapeño cheddar sausage was my favorite. It was such a great blend! The pulled pork was just right. The beef sausage was delicious and well my fiancé gave me one bite of the pork rib and let me say I'm not a rib girl but it was awesome!
