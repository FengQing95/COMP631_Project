Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for the food, we ordered the almond croissant and chocolate walnut cookie. The croissant was flaky and perfect in taste. The chocolate cookie was thick and has perfect ratio of chocolate chips, dough, and Walnut. We had to take the remaining home and the box they provide is so cute!
