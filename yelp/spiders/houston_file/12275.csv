JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brittney - Thanks for your review. Over the years I have visited numerous ramen shops worldwide, and I've spent anywhere between $8 and $20 for a bowl of ramen. What I have learned is that each ramen shop is unique in its own way -- from the noodles and broth they use, to the side dishes they serve, to the price points they target. Here in Midtown, goods and services trend toward the pricier side. Also, I do agree that our core demographic isn't families with young infants and toddlers. However, I will say this hasn't stopped hundreds of families from visiting us. In fact, I'm grateful our high chairs are sturdily built because they get a lot of use. Regardless, I appreciate your feedback and your patronage and we look forward to serving you again soon!
