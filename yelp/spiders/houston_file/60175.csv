Baby Barnaby's////It's nothing foodie or crazy creative, but the breakfast hits the spot--and the prices are reasonable.  All of the dishes are pretty much classic breakfast hits, with a bit of a Texas twist (of course!): French toast, eggs, etc.  The French toast was cooked perfectly, but I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken apple sausage.  A good spot for breakfast, but just know that they fill up fast--at 8:15 on a Saturday morning, the inside of the restaurant was entirely full, and only a couple of tables outside were open.
