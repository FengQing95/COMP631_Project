JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Kate - Thank you for your review. I regret that you did not enjoy your experience at JINYA. Please know that if you're ever dissatisfied with our food for any reason, that after sampling it, you inform your server so he or she can replace the item with a new one, offer an alternative or remove it from your tab. As far as seating is concerned, we do try to keep seating fair for all of our guests, as we can never determine if or when our house will fill up unexpectedly, especially now that school is out for the holidays. Though it is my understanding that we were able to move you to a larger table once the server was able to clear it with the host.
