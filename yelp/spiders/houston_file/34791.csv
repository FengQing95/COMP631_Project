Local Foods////But at first bite, I was completely wrong. This place knows what they are doing. The sandwich was surprisingly moist. The turkey was tender and not at all dry. The sauces and veggies blended so well with everything. I still think about that sandwich and wish I could have it for lunch again! The fruit they provided were just some oranges. They were alright but I was hoping for some berries or pineapples. The salad was good, but it was also super small as a side. The cookies they had were delicious! They were buttery, chocolaty, and a bit of a chew.
