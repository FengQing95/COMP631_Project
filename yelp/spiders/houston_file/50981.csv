Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were starving by the time we got seated at our table, and we ordered a tremendous amount of food for just the two of us LOL :). I got the Caprese Benedict and the eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise was just perfect. And, the hash browns wrote the perfect ode to the potatoes :). My roommate got the Fall greens salad and it was a very hearty salad. But the icing on the cake (literally) was the flight of pancakes we ordered (pineapple upside down, peach cobbler, and peanut butter cup). All three were out of the world, and the amount of sweetness in them was just perfect!! The flight of pancakes is a MUST-TRY!!!
