Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Waited around 15 minutes for our table which typically isn't a problem unless you get the table we got. The two person booth/table combo next to the kitchen door is absurd. It's unbearably hot next to the kitchen and under the heat lamp of a light (we even asked our neighbors if they were hot to make sure we weren't crazy) and WAY TOO CLOSE to the other two top next to it. Â We introduced ourselves to the people next to us because it was THAT CLOSE, felt awkward not to.
