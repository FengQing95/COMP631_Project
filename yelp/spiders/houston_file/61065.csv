Baby Barnaby's////Just like its big brother - BB is really charming inside.  Certainly a small neighborhood spot feel to it.  Our server was very cheerful and on the ball indeed.  I loved that he knew the regulars by name and everyone felt at home.  My man said that he had been there for years!!  That's gotta tell you something about a place that can keep wait staff content for multiple years!
