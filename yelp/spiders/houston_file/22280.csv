Uchi////If you are looking for that one perfect bite, I strongly recommend Uchi!  We went on a Sunday, and Uchi opens at 5:00 PM.  Arriving at 4:45 PM I realized a line had already formed (we had a reservation).  Standing in line in Houston, TX in the summer is NOT my idea of fun so this place had better be great.  From the first introduction to the hostess at the front door, to the brussel sprouts (OMG I suddenly love brussel sprouts) to the presentation of the check, I was in love with this place.  Anthony was our server, it would be wrong to call him just a waiter, and he was terrific.  One thing that really stood out to me, beyond the great food, was how each of the wait-staff worked with each other.  One more thing, GET THE DESSERTS!  Especially the sorbet selection.  A soy sauce sorbet?  Yep, it was tremendous.
