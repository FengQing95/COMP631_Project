Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The cafe itself is absolutely adorable. It's so nice and open with the giant windows that allow light to come through. The service of the place is also great especially for a casual cafe and bakery. The cashier and bus boy were so friendly and accommodating, which was very helpful since we had a toddler with us.
