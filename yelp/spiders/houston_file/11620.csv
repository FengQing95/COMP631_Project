JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only thing that I will fault them is that their bar seems to be run by a blind man. Well, I can't say that entirely since the person who hired the bartenders hired some really cute girls. I asked for a simple gin martini, 3 parts gin to one part vermouth. However, the bartender thought I said I wanted two martinis. She also just poured gin into a shaker and shook the hell out of it and served it in a glass..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
