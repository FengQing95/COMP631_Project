The Pit Room////This is probably the best BBQ I've had in town. I don't have a ton of experience with Texas BBQ, so take that with a grain of salt, but I know that the food is all excellent and there's a ton of variety. I also liked the casual location and vibe. I do wish the outdoor seating was more extensive and less cramped, but with food that good, I'll make do.
