Uchi////We started with the Yokai Berry, the Walu Walu, the Hama Chili, Â and the Pitchfork. All were on the happy hour menu and all were excellent. We actually ended up ordering another Yokai Berry later in the meal because it was so delicious. The flavors were all delicately balanced and interesting.
