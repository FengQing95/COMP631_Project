Uchi////Awful experience here this past Friday evening.  The entire place seemed disorganized and chaotic.  We have sat down for probably 30 minutes before our waiter greets us (no staff member can decide if they are our waiter).  We ask questions - our waiter, who is definitely new based on the guy shadowing him, doesn't really make an attempt to answer our questions about food but instead just talks about the restaurant and how they can "make us something".  Ok.  I guess he forgot I had a question.
