Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Driving in from Dallas on a late Friday evening we checked Yelp for a fun/interesting place to experience.  Bosscat Kitchen caught our attention because of the eclectic menu and incredible ratings.  The food and drinks were phenomenal!  Our waiter Victor was fun and attentive.  Next time we are in town we will definitely visit Bosscat again!
