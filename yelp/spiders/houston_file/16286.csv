JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went to Jinya to try the ramen as it is one of the most raved about in Houston. The atmosphere was pleasant and nice! I got the takoyaki balls as an appetizer and it was delicious! There were so many flavors in it. However, I came there for the main course (ramen). So I ordered the tonkotsu spicy ramen and have a before and after before I added my additional items. I ordered cabbage, corn, and chicken dumplings. The extra items were very expensive. When I tasted the ramen I was disappointed! The ramen was gross! The noodles were chewy and hard as if they hadn't been throughly cooked and spicy was not... spicy. There was an extreme lack of flavor. This place is overhyped because of the location. Â I honestly would rather cook myself maruchan noodles. Unfortunately I will not be returning... not even for the yummy takoyaki.
