Kata Robata////Been here a bunch of times. Love the place for service and food and environment. Good for lunch and dinner. The Texas Kobe beef skewer are freaking awesome melt in mouth type of food. Highly recommend trying it out. Tried the spicy soy ramen as well and it was good. Not spicy as we thought. Thankfully our 2 year old could eat it. Also picked from a sushi roll combo. Price is as expected for the location and area. If we are in the inner loop and want sushi this will be on the options. Parking decent. Nice place
