Local Foods////Overall, four stars for the great environment, ample seating, good service (a manager, I presume, came by to ask about our meal), friendly service at the bar, AND FOR THE BREAD. I love the idea of this restaurant - a NON pretentious organic restaurant. I like the fact that they use local businesses.
