Uchi////Third, HAPPY HOUR (5:30-6:30). One of my favorite happy hour places to be in Houston. Great deals for great food. I love to go early and get seated by the bar to engage with the wonderful chefs (they are pretty hilarious). My friends and I have gone many times during HH and ordered every item on the HH menu. The menu changes every now and then which I think is great.
