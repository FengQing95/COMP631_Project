Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the Bella! Bella! Bunny the first time I tried Snooze A.M., and I would no doubt try that again someday. It was savory and filling--no complaints there. What made my first trip so memorable and worthwhile was the server, Katrina. She was incredibly kind and informative! When I asked her about the pancake of the day, she said what it was and described it. I passed up on it, but at the end of the meal, she gave my table that pancake as a complimentary dessert.
