Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came during their soft opening, and they seem solid considering it's the soft opening. Very attentive wait staff, first name orders, beautifully designed interior and excellent pastries and coffees. Looking forward to exploring their menu further and checking out the evening scene!
