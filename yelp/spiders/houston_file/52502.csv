Kata Robata////Folks, this is a high-quality place, stop trying to get a Filet Mignon for the price of a Salisbury steak.  The negative comments here are ridiculous - from the owner of a competing restaurant complaining about no mushroom in his miso soup (the stuff they serve you at Benihana is chicken stock bro, not miso soup) to the guy who has a personal vendetta because his AMEX didn't go through for some reason (it was a computer error probably, I'm sure your computer works perfectly everytime).  Anybody complaining about Happy Hour.... c'mon really?  People here act like Happy Hour is a RIGHT and every single restaurant MUST have it.  I really cannot understand the negatives of the reviews here - complaining about food not coming out in the right order - you do know some dishes are more complicated that others, right?  If you order a steamed egg custard chawanmushi first, it will probably come out last.  Why?  Cause it takes a while to cook :)
