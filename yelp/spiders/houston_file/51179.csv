Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, service and food was great and everyone was very friendly, however, there was quite a long wait even on a weekday and after ordering it took about 30 minutes more to get our food. I don't know how much longer I would be willing to wait for food and don't even want to think about coming on a weekend.
