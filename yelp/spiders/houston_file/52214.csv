Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall I had heard good things about snooze, so when it was a rainy morning me and my girlfriend decided to splurge a little and get Snooze for brunch! There's a ton of menu options but I decided to get an omelette with a pancake on the side, and she got one of the kids meals with eggs, toast, and another side, because she wasn't too hungry.
