Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a very cute bakery and efficient, I had a tasty latte and a large chocolate chip and walnut cookie. The treats on display for purchase are lovely and worth visiting to sample. I say it's "too nice" for regular visits because its not a cozy cafe, it's set up for displaying its goods and quickly processing orders and serving customers, its not the type of cafe I'd go and sit in for a few hours enjoying a drink and a book.
