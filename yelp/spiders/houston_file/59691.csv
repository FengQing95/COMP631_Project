Baby Barnaby's////Based on all the reviews we tried this place for breakfast. It did not dissapoint at all. Priced well, and a great amount of food. Very filling. We thought we were going to each get a course and split a waffle, but Â neither one of us could finish our own plate, so the waffle is to go. My only issue would be that you are shoulder to shoulder with others, but for the food it's worth it.
