Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Upon stepping inside, I was immediately warmly greeted by 3 hostesses. 2 of the ones that I encountered that day were in training. There's a small self service counter near the door with complimentary Snooze special blend coffee harvested from a cloud something or other in Guatemala (not kidding, had a lot of time to kill while I was waiting for my order so I read everything on the table and walls). The counter wasn't fully stocked when I arrived, which was slightly disappointing, so I paid $3 for a to go cup of coffee. It was annoying because I had to ask for it and then again for cream. But I digress.
