Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here for the first time tonight. The service was amazing! Terry was so animated and fun. Knew the menu well. The bosscat burger is so delicious!!! And the pork belly poutine was decent as well. Dessert was the pot de creme--again, Delicious!! Got the bosslady and the bosscat and both drinks were so good! Thanks for the recommendations Terry!
