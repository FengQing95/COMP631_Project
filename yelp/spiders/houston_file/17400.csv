Uchi////I don't think I had anything that didn't taste good! We sat for nearly 3 hours munching away. My husband cannot stop raving about the fried milk dessert. He doesn't even like dessert! Among my favs: fried brussel sprouts, uciviche, the pork belly, hamachili..divine! Gets very busy and crowded but service was excellent!
