Baby Barnaby's////I am NOT an early morning person. There are only a handful of things that will get me out of bed early: my cat prancing all over my boobs; early morning roadtrips; when I decide to troll on my fianc√© until he wakes up... and nice, quaint, cheap breakfast joints with some good eats. Baby Barnaby's definitely takes the cake on that last one. And hey, now my bubs can't get mad at me for poking him awake! #trollstatus
