JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I  did notice some menu changes, they simplify it and no longer offer some options . I  don't know if they change management, ownership, or cooking formula.  The place is still very popular,  line is still long, they still have plenty of customers.  I am going to give them one more try....
