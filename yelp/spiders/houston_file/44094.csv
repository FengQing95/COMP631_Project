Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This was my first experience at this restaurant and i had to take the time to write a review. From the minute you walk in the door this place is AWESOME. Very eclectic and so clean. The ENTIRE staff was extremely personable and very professional. OMGEE and the food is AMAZING let me say it again AMAZING. I had the shrimp and grits and when i say delicious it was delicious. The desserts are to DIE FOR and the lavender latte was FABULOUS. My girlfriends and I had a ladies night and nobody was disappointed. I will be returning VERY OFTEN. Thank you for a FABULOUS FANTASTIC experience!!!
