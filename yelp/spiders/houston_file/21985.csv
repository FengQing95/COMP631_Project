Uchi////Every time I drive past this place on Westheimer, I tell myself how much I want to try Uchi. The time finally came and was really looking forward to dining here. We arrived at around 8:45 PM and the host told us it would be an hour and a half wait. I went ahead and gave them my name and we sat out in the patio. We waited a total of an hour before we were seated (can't believe we actually waited that long!)
