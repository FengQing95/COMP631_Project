JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The seating was a community one, which I do not mind, except I was seated next to someone who was sneezing and blowing his nose extremely loud. It is not Jinya's fault, but no one wants to dine with the sound of nose blowing right next to them. I suggest you guys take notice of health concerns, etc and please skip a seat. I don't mind waiting to avoid that unpleasantry.
