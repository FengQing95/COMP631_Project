The Pit Room////Although I'm a vegetarian, my husband and I had our first visit Saturday. It was a line but was moving quickly. While standing in line, an employee came by and was talking to us. I guess he could tell this was our first time. He shared how to order the brisket (wet or dry) as well as informed us about the section next door. Which the Pit Room owned as well. We had great conversation, even though my attention mostly was on how I was going to piece together my veggie plate. When we ordered the staff was friendly and informed us that we could eat inside or next door. So we went next door, the weather was so beautiful we ate outside. It was more like a big deck patio bar with a lot of seating flat screens music. You can go to the bar order drinks. It was a great atmosphere. My husband had the brisket plate and he enjoyed it. My veggies were delicious. It was pretty pricey and I'm not to eager to go back since I don't eat meat. However, if my husband want to visit again, we will be back.
