JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel sorry for Houston if this is the best you have! Everything ordered was mediocre at best and mildly seasoned. Â Tonkotsu black spicy was barely any flavor and can't blame them on spice as I don't know their levels. Still so disappointing on flavor. Had the chicken wonton, if you like chicken noodle soup from a can you're pretty close. Octopus balls must be literal meaning as the octopus inside was non existent. Nice looking dish just eh. The jinya bun was good. It seems they use some quality ingredients they just lack flavor. Pity. Had lychee mule and that was decent. Service was good and quick.
