Local Foods////Each time we come down for cancer check up appointments we have to eat here.  Fresh, healthy, delicious with very friendly service!  I had the shrimp/crab poorboy and it is the best one I've ever had.  The 2 sides I picked were kale and quinoa.  The kale was good the quinoa was dry and a little tasteless.  We had the butterscotch brownies and chocolate cupcake for dessert and they were yummy.  We will always return to eat here again!!
