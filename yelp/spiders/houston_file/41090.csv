Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to this place a few times. The only reason it gets 3 stars and no less is because I do like their croissants, but the goods end there.  The hot chocolate is very milky and sweet as so are many of the other things.  Today, for the first time, when we walked in there was nothing available but desserts.  We have never been there before 9-10 am EVER aund they have always have a good selection of pastries.  Today though it was ALL desserts, nothing else.  I don't know about  you but for me I don't want desserts at 10 am.  I wanted a breakfast pastry or bread.  My kids ordered some cookies and cheesecake.  My son is a cheesecake person, wherever there is he has to have it.  I have never seen him look so disappointed after eating a cheesecake.  We were told by the staff that it was very good.  Well, IT WAS NOT.  It was SUPER SWEET and tasted like burnt caramel, not like cheesecake.  The cookies?  Well, just an average mediocre homemade cookie, not even a good homemade cookie.  I told them at the store that the store has lost a lot of appeal and was quite a disappointment.  I will go back for the croissant one more time but if it is filled of desserts we will just walk out and not go back.  The desserts were mediocre, disappointing and left  a horrible taste on our mouths.   I hope they are able to keep better quality because what I saw today was mediocrity.
