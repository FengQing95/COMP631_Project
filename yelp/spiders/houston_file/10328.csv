JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the Tonkotsu Black ramen. At first taste, I thought it was really lacking something. After adding in 2 garlic cloves and some spicy sauce, it tasted much better. I really shouldn't have to add anything to give the ramen enough flavor though, so that was a little disappointing. I've had ramen plenty of times out in LA, so I did keep comparing Jinya in Houston to ramen out west. I think Jinya is a little overpriced, and the portions here seem to be smaller as well. I had a great time there with friends though, so maybe that's why I'm more inclined to give 4 stars and not 3.
