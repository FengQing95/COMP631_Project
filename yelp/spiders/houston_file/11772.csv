JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Definitely a place I would recommend for ramen in Houston, and Cindy was an amazing server, my drink was never empty and she was helpful all the time and did not over ask if I needed anything extra, I was able to enjoy my lunch as well as having everything I needed. If she's working definitely ask for her!
