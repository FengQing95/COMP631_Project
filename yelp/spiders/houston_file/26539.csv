The Pit Room////The past ~10 times I've been here the majority of my meals have been pretty subpar - brisket/sausage/ribs are all bone dry (turkey is surprisingly still pretty good though), cutters are giving smaller portions, and they are less friendly, nothing really tastes as good as it used to.
