Local Foods////Truffle Egg Salad = 5 stars. It is really that good. The only other thing I tried was the salmon, which was also good, but not anything super special. The only reason I'm downgrading to 4 stars is because both times I went, I have been disappointed by the sides. They sound so yummy on paper, but the flavor is somehow lacking. But overall, great place for lunch!
