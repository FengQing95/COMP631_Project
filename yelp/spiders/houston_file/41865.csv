Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Mid day on a Sunday isn't the ideal time to come. Long line/wait to be told they're out of 2 savory food items and don't have soy milk. Not much parking. The sweet items look amazing. I'll get a soy latte from somewhere else and come in for food on a weekday. Hopefully, my rating will be different then.
