Uchi////More like a 3.5...food was okay. Definitely overhyped and not the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. We went the omakase route which was recommended, and most of the stuff we tried was decent. One dish in particular we were not a fan of and the chef gladly agreed to substitute it for something else.
