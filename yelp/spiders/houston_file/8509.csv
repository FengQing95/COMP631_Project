JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The wait absolutely sucks, BUT the food is totally worth the wait. I was skeptical about eating ramen, but their ramen was amazing. I got the spicy chicken bowl which is not too spicy, it's enjoyable with a slight kick. Bowl was filled up with noodles so you get your money's worth!
