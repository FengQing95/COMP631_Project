Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In fact, if we see an empty spot in the parking lot, we will stop here even when everyone in the car is overstuffed from having finished off a wonderful meal elsewhere mere minutes ago AND we already have a box of donuts in the car, just so we can take a big box of pastries and a loaf of bread to go. Â Such gluttony is not our normal behavior; we just really like good bakeries, and Common Bond is very good.
