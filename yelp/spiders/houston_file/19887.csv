Uchi////Overall the sushi quality was good... not outstanding and def not 4.5 yelp stars outstanding.  I get it, its difficult to get really fresh sushi in Houston.  Pieces that left more to be desired -- bonito and arctic char.  The best courses were the hotate, and amberjack for that everning.  The remaining courses were interesting in that the chef likes to mix textures and flavors, most worked, some didn't (chocolate dessert didn't do so well).  My favorite non-nigiri dish was the cooked salmon with the fried salmon skin - really tasty.  One big disappointment was what the waiter touted as their most popular dish, the hamachi-orange -- highly disappointing.  The orange slices where big and way too sweet, really washed out any hamachi flavor, really not well executed at all.
