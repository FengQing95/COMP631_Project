JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////More than anything it has to be the long wait that keeps me from giving the final star, Â it that says a lot about the popularity of this place. The food is always on point even on its slower day, which is not really slow. What I like even more is the ambiance in the restaurant; dim lit, but equally inviting due to the closeness of the seating. JINYA is definitely a Houston must!
