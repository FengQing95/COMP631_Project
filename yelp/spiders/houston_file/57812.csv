Kata Robata////Don't to-go from this place, they don't place same quantity/quality compared to dining in. 6 pieces of thinly sliced salmon vs over 9 pieces that are thickly sliced. For this item that is highly priced, one would expect to get what is paid for. If you want high quality sushi with thickly sliced pieces, you guys might want to check out teppay on westheimer. All their pieces are thickly sliced, high quality...and HALF THE PRICE.
