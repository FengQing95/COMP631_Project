Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The atmosphere and food are great! There will forever be a line out the door though... The line moved semi-quickly so don't be too scared of it. I had a "pain au chocolat" and the Spicy Boudin Benedict. Everything was delicious! The boudin had a bit of a kick to it but wasn't too spicy. I'll definitely be back pending a good time of day to visit. The parking situation is a bit brutal. The lot is small and there is limited street parking.
