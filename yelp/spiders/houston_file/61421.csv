Baby Barnaby's////not sure how this place has 4.5 stars.. the wait was extremely long, the inside of the restaurant was packed (felt uncomfortable especially with COVID), the coffee tasted watered down & the food was mediocre & bland, and the waitress was very rude/short with me and my sister. i would recommend they work on their customer service and also check those who don't wear their masks properly or at all. definitely would not try this place out again.
