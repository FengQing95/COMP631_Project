Local Foods////Cool sandwich and salad place (and mini-market)! Came here on a quick lunch run and picked up (1) a shrimp arugula salad and (2) the cobb salad. Both are HEFTY salads with lots of filler! Probably one of the more satisfying salads around for the money. As the salad does lean on the bougie-er end, prepare to pay a little over $10/salad, but it is quite filling!
