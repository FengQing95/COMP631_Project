Local Foods////Enjoyed my food, tasty...fresh...& filling. The service was a different story. Don't allow the guy with the serious sideburns to be your cashier, my experience with him wasn't the friendliest. He was cold and made an extra effort to NOT make eye contact and was intentionally distant when giving my change (ie. dropping my change to avoid touching my hand) I would've given 4 stars if it weren't for my unpleasant experience with him.
