The Pit Room////The brisket was chewy and definitely not melt in your mouth. I could forgive the texture except the flavor was bland - you could not taste any flavor of smoke in the meat. To me, at a Texas barbecue joint the brisket should be the star and there was nothing exceptional about this brisket - average at best.
