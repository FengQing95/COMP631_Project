Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wow, amazed by the service and food at this place. Saw the high rating on Yelp and thought " to good to be true".  Sat at the bar with my wife and the "magic" happened.  Ordered some sides "dr pepper wings and grilled cheese (short rib)". Holy crap, William our bartender did not lead us astray.  Speaking of William, what spectacular service from this young man. Spot on recommendations and a solid old fashion maker.
