Local Foods////Wow.   Just lucked out tonight with one of the specials.  The vegan taco salad is just amazing, even if you are not vegan.   Great greens, avocado, yummy seitan or TVP, a few other veggies, a few tortilla chips and a tasty dressing and you're good to go!    Don't miss it, as it's not always on the menu.
