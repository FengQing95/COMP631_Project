JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We went on a Friday evening without reservations so there was a waiting period of about 15 min. Since it was our first time we didn't know about the common seating vs the tables. So ended up being seated in a cluttered part.. which was not too comfortable. Ramen was good though would have loved to have more meat in such a large portion. This place is alright for a casual weeknight dinner.
