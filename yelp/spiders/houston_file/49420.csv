Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Woke up hangry around 10:30am on new years day. I knew the line was going to be long, so before everyone in the house woke up, I drove to Snooze to put my name down and was told it'd be a 75 minute wait. Perfect. I drove back home, took a nap, watched some Ozark, cleaned up a bit, then hauled the gang to Snooze. Thankfully I live about 5 min. away. Anywho, on to the food.
