JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The most unimpressive flavorless bowl of ramen. There were none of the savory tangy creamy robust flavors I have grown to crave and had in many other cosmopolitans with a huge asian presence. If I was blindfolded I would have thought I was eating lipton soup. When I asked the kid taking our order about what more went into the broth or additonal seasonings he had no idea. I was looking for a richer miso broth. This prompted him to say there was some kind of paste. I Ordered the spicy chicken. There was zero spice and the person serving it said it was just chicken both. Neither individual suggested trying to add any of the "seasoned" soy sauce sitting on the table or hot sauce..which both did nothing. When he asked how it was I explained what my expectations had been in a flavour profile. He said he would mention to the manager. But no one came to see us. So much for relying on reviews or the presence of asians dining as a sign of a some authenticity. One might fair better with a grocery store package of noodles cooked aldente with fried shallots some sesame seeds seaweed flakes and a dollop of miso paste!
