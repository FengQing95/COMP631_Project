Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Let me start off by saying that I've been to Common Bond a lot. Probably about 10-15x. Common Bond is beautiful and has some of the best food and desserts around. I am a bit of a coffee snob and love going to all the different local shops in the Montrose area...that being said, Common Bond's coffee selections (Cortados, cappuccinos, flavored lattes etc.) are usually, great.
