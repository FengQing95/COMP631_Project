Kata Robata////The food is amazing and normally, I would happily wait for a table. But I made reservations for our anniversary for a Friday evening. I had even called back to move it by 15 minutes so KNOW I made it correctly with the correct phone number. We were told there was no reservation and the wait was 45 minutes. No apologies, no effort, I mean, If there had been an error in the date, how can there be NO reservations at all under my number?  We had a babysitter with a very strict leave time and couldn't stay.    Plus, it was a Friday night and everything was booked. We rushed to Uchi but they were reservations only but were kind enough to give us a complimentary $25 gift card with a gracious "happy anniversary."  We then went to Artisans and did have a lovely meal so the night was saved. But the customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. We will probably still come back because the food is that delicious but  don't count on your reservations.
