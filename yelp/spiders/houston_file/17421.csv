Uchi////I purchased a $75 gift certificate and gave it to a friend as a gift.  When my friend tried to use the gift certificate a couple months later, the staff had told him there was no money on the card so my friend had to pay for the dinner himself.  I was livid!  I called repeatedly for 2 weeks and was never able to reach anyone by phone.  I guess they don't care about customer service here.  Anyway, I filed a dispute with American Express and got my money back.
