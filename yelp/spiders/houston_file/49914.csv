Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Not Covid 19 compliant.  People crowding the entry.  Same dirty rags used for each table they are trying to sanitize.  Door handles being touched by multiple people entering and editing.  Poor sanitation. A person had the ignorance to sit next to me on a bench outside while I was waiting for a table.  I immediately got up.  No social distancing marked outside of this restaurant!
