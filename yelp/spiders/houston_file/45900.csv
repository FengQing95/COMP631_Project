Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Coffee is good (love how they serve flat whites here) but not amazing. I'd say it's average quality for a specialty coffee shop. Their drip coffee is also slightly sour, if that suits your palette. I love how the moment you open the door though the coffee aroma hits you strong.
