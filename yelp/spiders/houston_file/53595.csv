Kata Robata////Sadly the much-trumpeted fish and chips were not available for consumption when I was there, so I settled on the aforementioned lunch special.  The miso dressing is yummy, but a very similar one is served at my beloved Aka Sushi, so nothing new there.  After knowing sushi more intimately, it's a chore to choke down a California roll nowadays because there's so much else out there that's better.  Whenever a restaurant's lunch special includes it, I find myself wishing for something, ANYTHING that's better, but substitutions cost coin and I'm usually better off ordering everything a la carte than doing that.  The maki was regrettable, the nigiri unforgettable.  I'm not crazy about eel in general, but the salmon and tuna were amazingly flavorful and I know I'll be sticking to the straight-up raw fish next time an opportunity to hit up Kata Robata presents itself to me.
