JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When I made JINYA's curry dish for the first time, the ingredients included minced apples and minced chicken. I grew up eating my mom's curry rice which had big chunks of potatoes, carrots and chicken. Upon working at JINYA, this was the first time I saw Japanese curry made this way, wherein the chicken is heavily minced and reduced into the curry mixture.
