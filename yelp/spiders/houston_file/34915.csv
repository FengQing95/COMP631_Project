Local Foods////The place has a very hipster-y vibe. There is ample parking, which is surprising given that it's near the rice village area. The food is very good as well. It's a little pricey for what it is in my opinion (sandwiches and sides) but the taste is worth it. I will say that the menu seems pretty limited for people who like meaty meals, so maybe this isn't the place for meat lovers. Not that it doesn't have sandwiches with meat in it, but the options aren't a lot (based on my boyfriend's reaction when he saw the menu and decided to go eat somewhere else instead).
