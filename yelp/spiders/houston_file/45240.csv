Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////what in the heck happened? I used to come here all the time when it first opened. I moved out of town and returned recently. I was super excited to come back for breakfast, but I was sorely disappointed. They used to have the best kouign amans and almond croissants, but this morning it tasted OLD AND STALE. The filling for the almond croissant has changed. it looked syrupy and did not have any almond flavor. The flakiness is now clumpy and bready.
