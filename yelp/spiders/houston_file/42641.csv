Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really enjoy this place. The sausage biscuit is delicious. First food I tried here. Was after a hard night partying and really hit the spot! I am yet to have a bad experience. Croissants, flatbread, cappuccinos, tomato basil soup, have all been great. The fried chicken is good and can serve 2 people. I like the batter they use. The fresh baguette sandwiches are great for a quick snack with a coffee. Good atmosphere! I look forward to the next visit to try something else they have.
