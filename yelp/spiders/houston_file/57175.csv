Kata Robata////If I could remember every fish that was described I would inform everyone, but unfortunately I cannot. Luckily, I'm sure any staff member can give you more details when you order it. Our waiter was very knowledgable, was able to name and give us information on each fish. From my understanding it is up to the chef on what fish is provided in the Chirashi. But the most important thing is that it is all fresh! Each and every fish basically melts in your mouth; buttery, smooth, and sweet. It even comes with sushi rice, if you prefer your fish with rice. Everything was delicious. More than enough to share. Â
