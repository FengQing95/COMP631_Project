Local Foods////This place reminds me of my hometown Seattle since it is so vegan/vegetarian friendly. I tried the chicken crunch sandwich which was absolutely delicious but the star was really the quinoa salad. Definitely the best one I've ever had. Tangy, interesting textures, and oh so fresh tasting. I have tried to replicate it at home but it is never as good as the one you can order at Local Foods. The kale side is also delicious and their juices are wonderful. I really don't think you could go wrong ordering anything on the menu and the ambience is bright, happy, clean, and wholesome.
