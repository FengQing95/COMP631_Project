The Pit Room////The brisket was was somewhat moist, and didn't come apart too easy. The meat didn't seem melt in your mouth like I've had at other places. The pork ribs were about the same. It took some effort to pull the meat from the bone. Nothing special about the pork sausage. It was dry, and the meat could have been more finely grinded. The chicken was definitely the best item of everything I tried though. The meat was juicy, and had good flavor to it.
