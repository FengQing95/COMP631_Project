Kata Robata////From Lily to Thai and every person who works there (sorry I can't remember all of their names) the service is bar none incredible. And to top it off you get the most beautiful sushi and well thought composed dishes that could bring a food lover to tears. This review is strictly for those who work there. You have touched me with your food, your service and your care. Thank you for that. I will forever be a patron and regard you all with the utmost respect.
