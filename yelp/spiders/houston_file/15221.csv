JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend and I shared the Pork Chashu Bowl, (hoping that it would be as amazing as Ramen Bar Ichi's). It wasn't. The egg was overcooked, it was not yolk-y at all. Some of the pork was a bit tough. I ordered the Tonkosu Black Ramen since I really enjoyed it last time. Â Unfortunately, It lacked flavor and the pork chashu was a bit too fatty for my liking. My egg was almost completed cooked through, there hardly any yolk oozing out of the egg.
