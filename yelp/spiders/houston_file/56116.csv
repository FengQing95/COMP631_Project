Kata Robata////Shrimp tempura - The sweet potato was seriously so good, I now want to do that at home. The shrimp was great especially for my mother in law who doesn't really love sushi but loves shrimp. The breading was nice and thin with a crunchy pillowiness that one expects from tempura. The sauce just brought it all together.
