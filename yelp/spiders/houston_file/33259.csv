Local Foods////I like my pineapples from Hawaii, lobster from Maine, and cheese from France.  So eating local doesn't excite me, but all the positive reviews did.  Unfortunately, I was tricked by all my fellow yelpers once again.  I am guessing this inclusive, organic, cosmopolitan culture is so new to Houston that everyone is easily impressed.
