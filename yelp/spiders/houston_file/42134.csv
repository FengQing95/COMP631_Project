Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went for Sunday brunch.  Pretty packed but worth the wait.  I had the tamales benedict and it was amazing!  By far the best non-traditional benedict I've had and best tamales I've had.  The whole plate came together perfectly.  Only complaint - Wish they had a drink station where you can fill up your iced tea.  Drinks come in a small plastic cup and we had to go back and forth to the counter to ask someone for refills.  Not a huge deal, but since they were so busy, we felt like we were bothering.  Great place!  Definitely will be returning!
