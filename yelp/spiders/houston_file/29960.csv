The Pit Room////If they still have the Wagyu A5 BEEF RIB, you absolutely MUST try it. It feeds 2 people if you are getting multiple entrees. If you get one to yourself, I wouldn't order much more than that and maybe a few sides. It's about 1.2lbs on average and EXTREMELY buttery and fatty. The crust is perfectly crisped and has more of a toasty texture rather than a tougher edge, (this is due to the higher quality in marbling and overall tenderness)
