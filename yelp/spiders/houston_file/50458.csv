Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2. BEYONCE WEEKEND- this place is super slow on the wait time, because apparently people are placed on a wait list, texted when their spot is available, and given no specific amount of time to respond or to come back, we were told my management, well whenever they do decide to come back, we have to put them on the top of the list! Like WTH. I have NEVER in my history of going to a restaurant ever heard of this stupid policy. So that literally means, tables are open, while people or standing up crowded waiting to be seated, and i mean multiple tables. It's also a busy weekend, why is this placed not staffed better, to help get customers in and out.
