Kata Robata////Note: For someone who has eaten sushi in Japan, Singapore, London: Houston's Japanese food is Americanised but it's not a bad thing - I actually like all the crazy inventive rolls American sushi chefs has come up with. Carl Rosa's sushi class w (Google him he is the founder of The Japanese club in Houston) which my partner and I went would definitely open your eyes more to what real sushi is.
