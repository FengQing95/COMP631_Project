The Pit Room////This is my favorite smoked BBQ place and a Houston must (Hands Down)! From salads, tacos, and loaded frito pie (one of my favorites) there is definitely something for everyone here. Food is fresh, flavorful, and down right Deeliciousss! Indoor and outdoor seating is available. Free parking.
