Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Oh my goodness...where to begin! The service is phenomenal. Literally teamwork is motto here. The food is outstanding. When the waiter took my plate I had to check to make sure there wasn't another bite left. Terry is so funny and on it and Bre is so cute and sweet. They both were informative and knowledgeable about the place and menu. Love the atmosphere and open concept. I came here for brunch and got the pineapple mimosa and the Sunday Scramble. DELISH!
