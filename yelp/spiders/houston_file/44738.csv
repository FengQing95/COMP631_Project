Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes Common Bond is pricey, but absolutely worth it. The quality is evident, from the breads to the desserts and the meals. I mostly been here for brunch, which has always been a great experience. Coming with a friend or two, I like getting the $5 daily bread selection which comes with an assortment of the day's bread with a flavored house butter and jam or marmalade. Paired with a buttery/crispy/flaky croissant or some other pastry and coffee and you have perfection. I would also recommend their yogurt parfait, the jam pairs perfectly with the rich yogurt and crunchy granola. Although I can't speak for the lunch menu, I definitely would like to try it later on--they looked promising with fusion dishes.
