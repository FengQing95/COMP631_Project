Baby Barnaby's////Definite to return! Very small space with funky diner ambience. Perfect for Montrose. There is a wait but worth it. Like others that have commented, the green eggs are a pleasant surprise. If I had kids with me I would pass on this one because of the wait and small space, but for adults it's perfect. Recommendation: Migas and green eggs.
