Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is great and freshly sourced. I love that the menu is veggie friendly as well. I've tried a few dishes but actually love getting stuff of the A La Carte menu so that I can essentially create my own breakfast tacos. For vegetarians looking to get in their protein without relying on eggs, they have SOYRIZO, which is super tasty and packed with protein.
