The Pit Room////I had the brisket and turkey and loved it! Turkey was the softest I've had for bbq. Brisket isn't the best I've had, but the best I've had was Franklin's in Austin and Killen's in Pearland. It's connected to the bar next door, so you can eat there, watch some football, and down some beers in the nice Houston weather. Note that I wrote this in November.
