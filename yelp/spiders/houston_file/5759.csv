JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kim - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry your Tonkotsu Spicy was lacking spice and flavor. I'm assuming you have a strong tolerance for spicy food because the majority of our customers find the "Spicy" level too hot, while others who order the "Inferno" and "Double Inferno" levels find that level of spiciness just right.
