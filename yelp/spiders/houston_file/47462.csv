Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you want an affordable clean breakfast or brunch this is your place! 8 different options of eggs Benedict is a sell for me. They also have 6 types of Bloody Mary Cocktails that are super unique. They close every day around 3pm and the wait can be up to 2 hours on the weekends so keep this in mind and maybe plan for a walk around the Montrose neighborhood before dining. Also they offer delicious free coffee while you wait. Enjoy!
