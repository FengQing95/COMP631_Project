JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went to JINYA with my family on a Saturday afternoon. Customer service was exceptional. They have this rule that they don't sit parties that aren't complete upon arrival. So, we had to wait for like 10 minutes before we were seated, but it was understandable. They have a lot of Ramen options in addition to build your own Ramen. I had the "Sprouting Up Ramen" which was so flavorful! The food came in quickly too. I definitely recommend this location for a some good Ramen in the city!
