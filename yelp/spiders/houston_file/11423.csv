JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So there's still a very limited amount of ramen joints here in Houston and among those limited choices, JINYA Ramen is the one with the best consistency on the quality of their ramen. I'll be straight, I've eaten ramen in other states and in Asia, Houston ramen scene is still lagging behind from other major metropolitan cities but it's hard to find a ramen place that opens late on the weekend and have a nice bowl of noodle soup to cleanse up your alcohol diluted body that's also not Vietnamese pho.
