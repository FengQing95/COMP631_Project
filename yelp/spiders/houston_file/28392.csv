The Pit Room////The brisket was sliced to perfection. I fortunately got and end price so I really got a good depth of smoke flavors and the seasoning used was some delightful blend of spices, salt and pixie dust. The pulled pork was not dry as some places seem to let it sit for a while the Pitt room had a saucy yet freshness to where the meat didn't lose its textures. I wanted to grab a beef rib but they are extra and a heady portion a pound in its place I went with the pork rib and was not disappointed at all. Aside from my three meats I got to try the sausage. They have three varieties and if they are all as good as the beef then they should be packing and selling them in the grocery store.
