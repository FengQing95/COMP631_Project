Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I finally got to the front and I got the Kouign Amman, Almond Croissant (they also had a Chocolate Croissant that day), and a Pain Perdu, just to indulge a bit. I originally wanted a mocha but decided that I was already on the road to being diagnosed with diabetes, so I opted for a cappuccino. I was crazy happy that the display cases were actually full and you essentially toured them as you walked down the counter towards the register. We got a number, scouted out a booth in the back, and parked ourselves down. We got our drinks within 5 minutes and the french toast within another 7 minutes after. My friend finally got there at this time, about 40 minutes after 9, and was taking his turn in the line (which was never ending). Â
