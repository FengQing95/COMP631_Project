Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here for lunch with some coworkers. We were invited by Jose (one of the waiters), and we were all BLOWN AWAY. First off, the service was absolutely spectacular. Secondly, the food was delicious and unique. I had the Bosscat Burger with fries and it was definitely a taste that I had not experienced before. The velvet churros were also very good.
