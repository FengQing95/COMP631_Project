Kata Robata////I ordered the Sushi & Roll Platter for my main entree. They served nigiri of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, and unagi. The unagi was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of that sticky, sweet eel sauce. The scallop was hands down the best thing that I ate. It was mildly sweet with a hint of brininess.
