Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Dependably yummy and fresh brunch option, even if it is a chain, without the pomp or pretension of some places you could otherwise go and be "seen". I am a lover of poached eggs and all the fun things you can serve them on or with, and Snooze has plenty of variety in that respect. I give it 4 stars only because it's a chain and doesn't give me the warm and fuzzies I feel when I am eating at an independent restaurant with local owners, but otherwise it's great! Love the big booths and the themed decor!
