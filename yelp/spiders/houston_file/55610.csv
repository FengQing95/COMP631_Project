Kata Robata////I've had friends raving about this place for awhile so was glad to be able to try it on this trip to H-town.  We kind of splurged and ordered a bunch of different things so I feel like I got a good variety.  Overall, the food is very good to excellent but the drinks are mediocre to poor.
