Baby Barnaby's////We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and fruit pancakes (choices of blueberry, banana walnut or apple pecan). One huge, square fluffy pancake each topped with fruit and powdered sugar. We should've split the pancakes because we each only ate half. "The Man" told us to order the suicide pancakes next time which -for the same price- would include all of the fruits and nuts in one. May be what I order on my next visit or maybe the green eggs or maybe a breakfast platter... we'll see.
