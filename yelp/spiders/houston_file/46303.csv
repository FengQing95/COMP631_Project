Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The vanilla latte is arguably the best I've EVER had-- yep, I said it and I meant it! The scramble was EPIC! Their freakin' macarons-- good Lord! The biscuit was flaky and wonderfully made, and the preserve accompaniment was delicious and worth the honorable mention. The hubs had a beef, pot roast-ish deal that was divine but I was so locked in on my food that I didn't have the focus nor determination to skim off of his. He thanked me later!
