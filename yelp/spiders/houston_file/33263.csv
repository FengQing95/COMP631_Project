Local Foods////Mediocre like crazy. Had the crispy chicken sandwich. For $12, a mediocre chicken salad sandwich is made worse by the hipster vibe and faux cool decor. I don't understand how this could be ranked higher then many other excellent places in houston. Seriously disappointing. Who wants potato chips in their chicken sandwich? How about making the chicken itself actually crispy? For five dollars, maybe it would have been a good deal. I should have gone to the chicken place down the street.
