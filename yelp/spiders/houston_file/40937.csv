Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've come here twice now and I have never been disappointed! The menu is very interesting and quite unique. However, they have a great, knowledgeable staff who are super helpful when it comes to this. My friends and I usually struggle to pick something, but the food tastes MUCH better than it sounds. My entire table has left satisfied every time. Both times, I came during Houston Restaurant Week where they have limited edition menu offerings. One time I went and was able to get the Crawfish Empanadas. If you see this on your menu, get it!!! You will not regret it. I definitely want to return for brunch to try that side of the menu!
