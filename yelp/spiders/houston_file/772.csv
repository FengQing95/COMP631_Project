JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My girlfriend and I recently moved to Houston from South Florida where ramen is not something you can really find. We were very excited and after trying a few places around town identified Jinya as a standout and our go to place. We have eaten there numerous times and have always been pleased. However, last night we ordered to go for the first time and our experience was not anywhere near our expectation. We each ordered a different ramen bowl, mine with pork belly and her's with chicken...yet there was no meat in my ramen at all...and one piece in hers...not zero chicken...one small bite worth of chicken. Whenever we eat in house, we can count on her not being able to finish the bowl and taking half home for lunch the next day. However, once again, inconsistent with our usual experience, she was able to finish the entire thing even after eating dumplings before. So not only did they just not provide any meat but the portion sizes were noticeably different. This was a really negative experience for us and so disappointing because we have enjoyed eating here so much. I know I won't be ordering to go anymore and honestly I think I'm going to reopen my search for a ramen restaurant.
