Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Final Annoyance 5 - I am a HUGE people watcher. I was watching customers at the bar. One girl gets a text that her table is ready, but she has already ordered food at the bar. She shows the text to a patron she has been talking to at the bar. She tells her to just take her name and go up to the hostess stand. So the girl does. I watch this all go down mind you and I am livid because I know the second girl came in long after me and i am dying to eat at this point (it's almost my time to be called and I am angry hungry). I watch the conversation between the hostess and the girl. The hostess realizes that it's not the original girl who put her name in, BUT STILL GIVES HER THE TABLE! All the while I hear her telling the other hostess that, "sometimes we do this." Now, it would be EXTREMELY coincedental that this girl's name was actually the next name on the list, but I know what I saw. So, Â at this point I am beyond LIVID and walk up to her and tell her I saw exactly what went down and I want to see her manager.
