Uchi////If I were only reviewing the food, then it could have easily received four stars. However, since going to a restaurant like this is more of an experience than just eating food, then, in terms of Yelp-star levels, everything was NOT a-ok, and I've experienced better (namely, Uchiko in Austin).
