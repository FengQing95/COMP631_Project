Uchi////This place is simply fantastic. When I showed up for our 5 pm reservation there was already a line up down the side walk. We were in a slight hurry, so to avoid having to decide what to get from the extensive menu, we went with the 10 course chef's tasting menu. Every bite was delicious and the chefs beautifully balanced textures, acids, sweet, savoury, and spicy. Even the courses that were not our favourites were really good. Special mention to the crab dish, and the machi cure (kind of like smoked yellowtail nachos), as we contemplated ordering seconds of those dishes as soon as we were done. If you get a reservation between 5-6:30 pm Â you can order from the sake social menu and try several dishes without the high price tag. We will definitely be back.
