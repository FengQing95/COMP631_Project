JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After eating Ramen in Japan last year I have been on the hunt for some good Ramen that is authentic and delicious. I have tried a few places in Houston but none were as good as JINYA.  I can tell you this is the closest you'll get to the Ramen we had in Japan. I ended up getting the Spicy Chicken Ramen added extra garlic and seasoned egg. It was delicious.  I will be definitely going back again and again.
