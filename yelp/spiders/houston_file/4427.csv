JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the others, the salad and the mochi, they were other downsides. The salad was unappetizing. I would have much preferred the standard ponzu sauce, sesame oil, etc. As well, the mochi was disappointing at best. It was crystalized and the ice cream was also frozen over and melted then refrozen. Not the greatest experience.
