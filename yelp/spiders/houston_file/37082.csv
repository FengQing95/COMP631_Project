Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Love the atmosphere, food, drinks, and friendly service. The place was clean and the bathrooms were well maintained. My only critique is maybe turn the music down a little bit as my friend and I were having to yell across that table to talk to each other. I would recommend this place to others and will come back.
