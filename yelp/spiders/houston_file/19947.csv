Uchi////Easily one of the best and most unique Sushi restaurants ever!  We try to have one person in our party order the Chef's plate just so that we can see & taste some of the most eclectic but extremely tasty chef's selection.Machi Cure is a definite must and always my first order when I sit down.  Oysters on the half shell are typically paired with seasonal fruit - one time we had strawberries, another time coconut - each time they were AMAZING!  They are pricey per oyster...but worth the cost!!!  Edamame is great - they fire roast the soybeans for a great smoky taste - like no other restaurant.  Fried milk is always a must and a great way to end the dinner. Wished they had a full bar though.
