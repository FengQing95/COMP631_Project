Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I didn't want to leave, it was such a pleasant experience that I left a 100% tip with a little note saying everything was perfect. Snooze has me considering making Houston my new home. Totally worth the 40 minute wait on a beautiful Friday afternoon. So glad I ventured out on my own while visiting Houston.
