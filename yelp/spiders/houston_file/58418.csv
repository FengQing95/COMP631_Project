Baby Barnaby's////What huge portions!! Their food is healthy and pretty tasty.  I love the tuna melt (they put cheese in their tuna sandwich and then heat it up).  Also, their fresh strawberry lemonade is really delicious.  There are little strawberry pulps inside that makes it taste all the more good for you too.
