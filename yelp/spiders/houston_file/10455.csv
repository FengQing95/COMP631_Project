JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The search for the best ramen in Houston can stop here.  I've had plenty of ramen from different places and in different cities, but I fell in love with the black tonkatsu ramen. "Once you go black..." Applies here hahaha.  Their tonkatsu broth is tasty but once you mix the "black" part of the broth (garlic oil), you're taste buds will do a happy dance, at least mine did anyways.
