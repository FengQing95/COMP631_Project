Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait is what it is. This is Houston and it's common to expect a long wait for breakfast spots, especially with the "brunch" craze of today. I'm from a state that has four Snooze locations, I also visit Denver often (where they started) so I was overly excited to here Snooze was coming to Houston. When you come here (not if, because you should come here) I suggest getting a flight of pancakes so you can sample different flavors. Also ask them what the pancake of the the day is because it's always changing and isn't listed on their menu. Their breakfast burritos are massive and all plates are largely portioned. Food is excellent, people are kind, vibe is good.
