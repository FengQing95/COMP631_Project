Kata Robata////I haven't had any issues with service and the waiters are generally good about giving recommendations.  I'm usually here with a big party so we've always gotten reservations and I imagine it's necessary for Friday/Saturday nights.  Yes, there is a parking lot and while I've usually been able to find parking easily, there was one time where I had to park on the street behind the restaurant.  Overall, yay for not having to valet!  This place is by no means a cheap place, but the experience is worth it!  With alcohol (I split a bottle of sake with a friend), my total bill was just under $50.
