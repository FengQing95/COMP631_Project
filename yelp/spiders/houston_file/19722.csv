Uchi////Always a great experience at Uchi. Recommend ordering off the menu and allowing the wait staff to conduct the interview and then the sushi chef will send different items to the table, one after the other. The fried milk is amazing. Love this place, and even considering its popularity - the hostesses are really friendly, not arrogant. Fun vibe, great people!
