Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Loved this spot. Inside is cafeteria style (order up front, find a seat, and your food is brought over). Came on a Saturday morning and although there was a lineup and a full cafe, the line moved quickly and we were able to to find a table easily! We ordered the tamales Benedict, croque madam, some different pastries, and coffees. The pastries were totally to die for, and the coffee was great. I did like both breakfast entrees we ordered, but definitely preferred the tamales Benedict. I loved the cafe decor and super friendly staff. I will definitely return to try more pastries and other menu items, because all the food orders that the waiters were serving looked so delicious!
