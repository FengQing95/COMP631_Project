Uchi////Each dish (oysters, flounder, salman, wagyu to name a few) was beautifully prepared, presented and crafted.  I want to say there was a party in my mouth with every bite but we couldn't help but feel that some of the dishes were heavily over-salted and it was hard to get past.   Each course was delicious, but only one or two were outstanding and I guess that is where my expectations lay.
