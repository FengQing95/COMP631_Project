Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The ambiance in the restaurant is clean, bright, stylish.  They serve complimentary coffee while you wait.  The staff was friendly as they took names of arriving customers, and our server was friendly and competent.  When we mentioned to him that we would be sharing both items, he offered to have the kitchen split the Spuds Deluxe on two separate plates for us, which was perfect.
