Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We drove almost 40 mins to get here only to discover that breakfast had ended ten minutes earlier at 10:30 (Which is a little too early in my opinion...). We were bummed, but since we were already there, we decided to stay and order lunch.... Only to be told that lunch doesn't start till 11:00! What kind of foolery is that?  Why the 30 minute gap between breakfast and lunch?  Anyway,  we ordered a few pastries, some coffee and left.
