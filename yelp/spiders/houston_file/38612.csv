Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Got the bosscat burger "chef's way" and it wasn't bad. The patty wasn't greasy, but it crumbles when you bite into it. It's interesting how they use cheese that you can tell is real, shaved cheese, not just some artificial, processed stuff. The toasted bun was really good and the other ingredients made this burger taste fresh (for a lack of a better word). It's definitely not the taste of typical greasy American burger, so I have mixed feelings about it. Not sure if it's worth $16 without fries.
