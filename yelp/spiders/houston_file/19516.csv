Uchi////We got sat exactly at 9:30pm! Sweet they are prompt and on time. The night is going fantastic! So far I'm thinking this might be the best restaurant in Houston in a long time. Everything was very well organized and welcoming. Now time for the food. We ordered quite a bit and everything that we ordered we devoured immediately! The flavors are so unique, fresh, fish just melts in your mouth. I was in heaven! Every bite every dish it was like having a foodgasm in my mouth! Including desserts we ordered for two people a total of 16-20 dishes. Yes people are so right to rave about the brussel sprouts it was AWESOME! I will DEFINATELY return!
