Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The only real complaint I had about the experience was the noise level. There was loud music playing from the moment I walked in and the dining area was crowded with other groups of people, all shouting over the music and each other. At a couple of different times the volume of the music seemed to increase drastically and by the time we were making ready to leave it was difficult to even hear the person sitting right next to me. This probably isn't the place to bring someone for a deep conversation, but if you want to get together for a delicious meal with a group of people you don't really want to talk or listen to, this would be a great option.
