Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose//// We tried the chocolate filled croissant, which was okay. My boyfriend tried their biscuits with gravy, which were good, but they were too over whelming. One biscuit would have been enough because the biscuit was so rich in combination with the heavy sauce (it came with two). I ordered something like toasted bread with a hollandaise type sauce, shrimp and an egg in the center. This dish was also too rich because the bread seemed to have been smothered in butter and then topped with a buttery heavy sauce. Although the dish was smothered in butter and sauce the bread was still pretty hard and crunchy. I was afraid that the bread would fling off of my plate while attempting to cut off a piece to eat. Both dishes were intended for one person, but they were both so rich, that they were impossible to enjoy. A good dish should be entirely enjoyable, not just to a point. Â
