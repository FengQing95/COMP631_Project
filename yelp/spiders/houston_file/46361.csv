Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came in for to-go coffee at almost 3:00. There were TWELVE visible employees - only one of which was on a register. Inconsistently, might I add. You had to wait in the pastry line to order coffee. My companion, realizing that no one in the pastry line was eager to get anyone in or out quickly tried to let the coffee bar guys know our order so it would be ready faster. They said we had to wait in the line for the register. There were only two parties ahead of us but it still took TWENTY TWO MINUTES for us to get to the register and get served. 22 minutes. For to-go coffee. Employees were doing phone orders, standing around, making sure no one was too close together but not serving people or getting anyone in and out.
