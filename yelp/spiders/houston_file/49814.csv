Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm not a big fan of traditional breakfast foods, I mean how good can you make eggs, sausage and hash browns... But I will say i enjoyed snooze eatery. I ordered the Benny duo (salmon and prosciutto one), the spuds delight and sampled the French toast and blueberry pancakes. I have to say the sweet dishes did not disappoint. They pancakes were amazingly fluffy and the French toast was ahhmazing. I added Barbacoa and rosemary sausage gravy to my perfectly cooked hash. The portions are huge! Probably could have easily shared it. The only disappointment were the bennys... They had a strange flavor and were not very substantial. The hollandaise was meh.
