Local Foods////Local foods is a very hip, trendy, health-conscious sandwich shop at you pay more for sandwiches because of the interior design on the inside. Nonetheless, I don't mind paying more for my sandwich because I love coming here to catch up with friends and the sandwiches are pretty darn good. They all come with your choice of two sides or chili and all their sides and chili are so tasty that I wish I could make them at home myself.
