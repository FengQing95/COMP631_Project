Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was visiting Houston for a week.  My friend purchased pumpkin bread and almond croissants for us to eat for breakfast after our late night arrival.  They were delicious even being a day old.  The almond croissant was probably one of the best I've had!  She also purchased the strawberry lemon jam.  I had some on hawaiian bread toast.  It was the best!
