Baby Barnaby's////I finally had a chance to check this place out this weekend. As mentioned, the green eggs were pretty scrumptious. The flavors were all very interesting and I thought it was an interesting way to have scrambled eggs. Not something I'd want everyday but it would be nice to have it every once in a while.
