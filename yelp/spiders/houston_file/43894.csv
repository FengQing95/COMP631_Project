Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place deserves 4.5 stars if I could help it. The food is completely on point--but the service and workflows are somewhat lacking. To be fair, this establishment is brand new and no one has been less than generous in smiles despite long wait times. I have full faith in them to streamline things along.
