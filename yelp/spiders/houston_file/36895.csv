Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Really enjoyed our experience here! The food was tasty, both the beef and the shrimp and grits we got were cooked wonderfully. The cocktails were pretty good too, although not the best I've had, but that could've just been that I wasn't a huge fan of the one I ordered, others may be better. The only downsides here are that it is very loud, so not great for conversations (or hearing your waiter) but the great tasting food makes up for it. I appreciated the normal portion sizes as well, since so much of Texas portions are XL, it's nice to eat out and feel comfortable at the end instead of stuffed.
