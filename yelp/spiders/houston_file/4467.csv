JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Beverages: since ramen is high in sodium, a great ramen place also has to have great beverages to quench your thirst! Jinya has a full bar in the front to cater to your needs. There are draft beers and some awesome cocktails to choose from, and basically anything you want. I have yet to try a drink with my ramen but I'm sure they'll have great recommendations.
