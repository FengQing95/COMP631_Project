JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jen - Thanks very much for the 5-star review. I'm very glad to hear you tried us out and liked our ramen. I'm also pleased to hear our servers didn't let the lunch rush affect service. On behalf of my front and back of house, I thank you for dining with us, and we look forward serving you the next time you find yourselves in Houston.
