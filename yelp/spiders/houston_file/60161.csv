Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is one of my favorite breakfast places in the area and it's one place I wish I could get to a bit more often. I miss the days in college when I had my place. A place where everybody knew my name - yeah that's a reference to Cheers. My point is that they have great customer services and I feel like I could get that level of service from them.
