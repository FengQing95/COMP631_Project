Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1) Grand opening: Shouldn't have even made the effort and the trek there due to the inopportune time that we arrived. It was the 10:30 am - 11:00 am gap where they stop serving items from their breakfast menu and prepare for lunch. "Ok", I remember thinking in my head. "Let's try a pastry!" Hmm.. I looked around and what did I see? The lack of pastries available considering they are a... bakery. GASP. "Ok," I remember saying again, "let's just come back another time so that way we can fully review this place." I believe I had patience due to the fact that I knew it was their grand opening day.
