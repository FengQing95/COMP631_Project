The Pit Room////But man, the reason to come and try it, is the food! They put a lot into the cooking process, marinating their meat for days ahead of time and then working the smoker over night. They actually have night-shift chefs that work the smoker while most people are sleeping. All of this creates that delicious, truly smoked food you will see in my pictures. Take a look at that pink smoke ring on the meat! Way to go chefs!
