Uchi////We started off the evening with Nathan explaining the menu and asking if we wanted to order things off the menu or if we wanted him to just send out a few things he thought we'd like so we could get a feel for what Uchi is. We did that and did not regret it. We ended up sharing about eight dishes, each more delicious than the last. Their Walu Walu is to die for, their hirame usuzukuri is mouthwatering. Even their uchi salad is delicious -- my boyfriend and I ate every bit of it and he's one of those people I need to trick into eating greens in his diet.
