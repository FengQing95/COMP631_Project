Baby Barnaby's////I don't understand the hype about this place. Slow service and average food. Sure the prices are low for the amount of food you get but there isn't much flavor and food is unhealthy (the migas are completely covered in cheese and about 1.5 cups of Â fried potatoes which are not seasoned)
