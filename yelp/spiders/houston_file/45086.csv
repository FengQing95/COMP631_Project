Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The "table service" is earnest, polite, and wanting to please.  You know that they want to make you happy, and thankfully they aren't like a courtesan paid by the hour.  They will let you take your time about this enjoyment.  And in this sense, it's more like a loving, reciprocating covalent bond.
