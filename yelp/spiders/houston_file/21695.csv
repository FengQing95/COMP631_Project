Uchi////One of the best izakaya restaurants that I have ever been too...be prepared to wait a long time or make reservations well in advance because they only open from 5-10pm. They are limited quantity so late comers might not be able to taste certain items, this is a must try for Japanese food lovers!!!!! Sooooo fresh and amazingly tasty, words can't describe how awesome the food was...my favorite was the hamachi and the machi cure, it's pricy here but well worth also save room for their house special fried milk
