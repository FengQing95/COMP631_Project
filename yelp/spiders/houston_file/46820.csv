Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although the wait is always outrageous when we get there, I feel the food is worth it. You can always check in and they'll text you when a table is being cleared, I always use that time for errands. Back to the food, a lot of the menu items are customizable so you get exactly what you want exactly how you ordered it! I love it!!
