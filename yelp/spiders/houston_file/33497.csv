Local Foods////Crunchy chicken sandwich: Average. I am perplexed by the popularity of this sandwich. It is not unpleasant, but I was sorely disappointed with how not particularly crunchy it is (the supposed crunch is from some crushed nuts, which are not all that crunchy). I am also not a fan of provolone cheese, so that may have colored my judgement a bit. The pretzel bun is good, though, and the slab of rather bland, but juicy chicken breast is generous.
