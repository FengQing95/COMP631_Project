Uchi////The highlight of our meal is the Fried milk and peanut butter semifreddo. They were divine. We definitely will come back again. I heard the best bang of your buck is come during their social hour which is from 4:30-6:30pm when everything is half off considering it is a bit pricey. Next is to go Austin and try out Uchiko.
