Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////- Bosscat Fries: These were cooked well, much better than the last time we ate here. The fries were actually cooked all the way through, with a soft inside and a crunchy outside. The homemade ketchup is ok. I'm still a Heinz girl at heart. For me these fries are a solid 3.5 stars, but the boyfriend gives them 5 stars. Judge for yourself. Fair warning, these are HUGE fries, more like giant potato wedges.
