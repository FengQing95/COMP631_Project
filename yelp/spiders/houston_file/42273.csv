Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This SHOULD have been a five-star review. I keep saying that about Houston restaurants ... there's a theme there. I don't know what it is yet and I won't waste your time figuring it out here. Suffice it to say that most of the "hot" or "new" "spots" we've been trying inside the loop are (like Common Bond) good but not (yet) great.
