Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Paloma is one of my go-to mixed drinks and I love Mimosas (even outside of brunch) but something about this cocktail didn't sit right with me. The grapefruit juice didn't taste fresh and the tequila seemed as if it was watered down. There could've possibly been too much ice in my glass.
