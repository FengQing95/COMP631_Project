Baby Barnaby's////It's a small place, so be ready to wait to be seated. The wait is well worth it! While you wait they have water and if you can't wait to get your coffee they provide it for you while you wait, of course the coffee is not free. The food was delicious and the prices are great! We sat outside and the atmosphere was pretty laid back. Loved it! Coming back for sure!
