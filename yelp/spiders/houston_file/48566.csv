Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Absolutely amazing! Our wait was originally going to be an hour but we were seated in about 25 mins. They text instead of using old fashion buzzers. The margaritas were phenomenal and the food was too. We had French toast, omelettes, sausage, hash browns... all of it. Our waitress was awesome. Our receipt says her name is Kitty Kat. The hostess was super nice as well. Clean bathrooms. Seriously, we had a great brunch.
