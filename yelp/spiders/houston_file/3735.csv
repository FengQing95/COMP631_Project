JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I LOVE this place!!! Definitely the best ramen spot in Houston. It is a cozy atmosphere with delicious food. I have never had an issue with service at this restaurant. Though there is ALWAYS a wait no matter what day of the week you go, it is totally worth it in my opinion. My boyfriend is vegetarian and even though he doesn't enjoy the vegetarian option much, he absolutely loves the vegan one. Luckily, there is something on the menu that caters to both of our tastes. It is great for dates but not so much for groups, as you have to wait until everyone is present before they seat you and the wait even just for 4 people can get very long.
