JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kayleen - Thank you for your review. I regret that your experience with us was tainted due to the extended wait time. May I ask if your party was complete when you were quoted 25-30 minutes? Unfortunately, if your party is incomplete, we sometimes must skip over you to seat another party that is fully present, which will add more time. This is the only the way to keep our seating system fair.
