Baby Barnaby's////We are so disappointed about the takeout food today. We have had the breakfast there for over three years. That's the first time we questioned the food quality. My apple sausage and toast was super over burned. Everything in my plate looks dark. The Migas ordered is not half as good as it used to be.
