Uchi////Everything was great. The walu walu was dried so the server sent out a second one...but it was also dry :( but it took 20 mins to get each dish so we white lied and said it was delicious anyways. Didn't want to wait for the supposed hype. Everything else was delicious though. My favorite was the pork belly... Ended having that as an appetizer and dessert... (Fatties). The rolls were delicious. Service is amazing (like I said, one dish at a time) but you savor every bite. Fried milk dessert was interesting...can't say I was the biggest fan. Brussels sprouts were nice and buttery and salty. Uchiviche was a good happy hour option. Hot stone beef was really good!! It was fun! Pricy though... $250 bill over 3 hours. Worth it.
