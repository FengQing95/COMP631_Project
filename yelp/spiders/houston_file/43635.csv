Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food-wise, my sister got the fruit croissant, and I got a chili relleno sandwich. The croissant was large and deliciously flaky. I didn't care too much for the fruit topping, but my sister really liked it. The highlight of the chili relleno sandwich was the bread--so pillowy! The guac and chili weren't bad, either.
