The Pit Room////I came here for a work event and boy was I not disappointed! The brisket is as fatty and juicy as everyone says it is. A must during your visit. The pulled pork was also flavorful and smokey without putting sauce on it, which is sometimes hard to find. You'll also have plenty of options for sides and drinks. Though the inside area is small for seating, head on outside since the outdoor deck is shared between the two restaurants and you'll be able to fit bigger parties out there. Enjoy!
