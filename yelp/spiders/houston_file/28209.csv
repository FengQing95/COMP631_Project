The Pit Room////Love that their bbq isn't super fatty. The mac n cheese was a little too runny for me (as if it needed to be baked), elote is ok, but surprisingly they have a great salad here. I love the brisket and jalape√±o cheddar smoked sausage. Great customer service as well. Can get really packed around lunch during the week
