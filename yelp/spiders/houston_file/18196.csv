Uchi////Food from out of this world! Never expected to find something this great in Houston, on par if not better than places in London or New York. Â Must haves: uchi salad, brussel sprouts, foie negri, and the milk dessert. So sad to see the duck jar jar taken out of the menu, had it three years ago on my last visit... None the less, amazing food and atmosphere. A must on every visit to Houston
