Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Giving 3 stars because of MY experience but I feel like they could def be better. We ordered the steak special they had- the waiter then comes back and says they are out of steak so offered us another option for the "same price" - at the end they ended up charging us more for the other option they had. The food was pretty good though. Willing to give this place another try.
