Uchi////I have been to Uchi several times throughout the couple years that it has been open.  Each time more outstanding than the last.  The waiters are very knowledgable about every ingredient on every dish on the menu.  I always leave ordering up to my waiter as I love to get a taste of everything.  I like everything but you can inform your waiter on what you do not like and he will serve you accordingly.
