The Pit Room////Brisket. Too fatty for my taste but very tender and flavorful with a good bbq sauce if you like bbq sauce. My husband liked the smooth cheese Mac and cheese, I liked the charro beans better. The macaroni and cheese was too "commercial" to me, less homemade, unlike the the charro bears.
