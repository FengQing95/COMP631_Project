Uchi////HOLY MOLY. I would write this entire review in caps if I didn't think it was annoying that's how amazing it was. I went on a super nice date and was treated so nicely by our waitress, I wish I could remember her name. She helped us decide on dishes based on our pallets combined. What a great experience.
