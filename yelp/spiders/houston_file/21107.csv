Uchi////Once seated (which was at the time of my reservation - no problems there), the experience really went downhill.  First off, I thought it was strange that we had 4 different waiters.  It's like they have several waiters that work all of the tables in the restaurant.  For what you are about to pay, I expect more personal attention.  Anyway, the menu is quite vast, so rather than playing a guessing game I decided on the Omakase, which I understand translates into "I'll leave it to you."  It was describe to us that you could choose from "Signature Tasting" - which is 6 courses of their best menu items or you could go with the "Chef's Tasting" - which is 10 courses of the chef's choosing (described as the more adventurous of the two).  Well, being the adventurous type I decided to leave it in the Chef's hands.
