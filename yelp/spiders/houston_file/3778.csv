JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Long wait for ramen that I thought was good but not exceptional. The sauces provided on the tables were really good and added a little kick to my dish. Poor service at the bar when we were waiting for our table. Very loud and a little hard to have a conversation if you end up at the community tables. More likely to try other Ramen in Houston than go back to Jinya and wait for so long.
