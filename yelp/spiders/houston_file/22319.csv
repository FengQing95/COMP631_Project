Uchi////I live in California, but visit Houston once a year - and my first stop is always happy hour at Uchi's! Everything is delicious, much of it is imaginative - even when it's not perfect, i give them kudos for trying that flavor combination. You CANNOT miss the fried milk dessert! or anything with eggplant or wagyu
