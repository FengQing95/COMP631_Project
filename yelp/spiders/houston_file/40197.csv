Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As far the rest of the place they have a ton of whiskey's. Some can get pricey but its expected for a place like this. They do have a private room with a ton of whiskey's on the wall which looks super cool. I didn't go in there but there are pictures of others who have. Looks like an experience. Â If you are in the area I would for sure recommend this place.
