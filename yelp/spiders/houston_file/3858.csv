JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Been here a few times. We ordered gyoza, cha-cha cha ramen and sprouting ramen also a to go Tokyo ramen. We are pretty disappointed due to their changing flavors. The richness of the flavors that we are expecting from the previous visits seems to be long gone. And the broth of the ramen seems to as cold as the weather. We wanted a hot and rich ramen which they poorly deliver.
