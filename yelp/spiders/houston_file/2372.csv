JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I guess I don't know about other ramen places, but this is a treat. The prices are reasonable and the array of ramen soups is mind blowing. I always add an egg and get medium spicy. The staff are good at figuring out what spice level you want. Some of the seating is communal, most of it is cramped and loud, so go with friends you don't mind being close to.
