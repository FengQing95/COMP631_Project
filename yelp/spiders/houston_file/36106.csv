Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So we stopped here for a quick brunch before heading to Austin and I'm very glad that we did! This place is super cute! From the chic interior decoration to the mellow ambiance. Unfortunately I'm writing this review about a month late so I forgot our orders . But I will say we order 3 different plates and were delicious!!! If you're looking for a good mimosa and fancy brunch, this is your place!!
