Baby Barnaby's////I've frequented the Barnaby's restaurants for many years, but my first time at Baby Barnaby's was last weekend. I feel like people give brunch spots rave reviews for their booze most of the time. Baby Barnaby's doesn't serve alcoholic drinks, so all the praise they receive is legitimately for the food they serve. They really don't offer anything out of the ordinary, but everything on their menu is damn tasty, and prepared really well. I got the breakfast plate, which consisted of eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast - you probably could easily make this at home, but it wouldn't taste half as good. The smoked sausage has great flavor, and the potatoes are perfectly cooked. And don't miss the fresh-squeezed juice! It REALLY is fresh squeezed, they have an industrial juicer on the counter, and you can see oranges circulating through it. The resulting juice goes directly into a pitcher, which they'll use to fill your cup, right in front of you. The server was efficient, and had a great sense of humor too.
