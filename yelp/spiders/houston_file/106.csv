Uchi////If you give this place 5 stars it's because you feel the need to justify your $200+ bill, or you're just so delusional in life that you think it's worth it. I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday. After leaving we decided you should only come here if you want to be told every ingredient in your food, and be less than excited about your sushi rolls. I recommend Osaka across the street. The rolls at Osaka are FAR more presentable, larger, and have flavor. If you take this review as banter, you'll understand when you order one. Boring. Also, unless you drive a foreign or "luxury" car the vale will park your vehicle in an empty UNLIT grass lot across the street. Thanks guy for parking my new truck over there. Â I assumed you didn't understand the value of it, but it's made in America and costs more than that C class Mercedes parked in the front row... I hope you didn't mind me stiffing you on a tip because I didn't think twice about it.
