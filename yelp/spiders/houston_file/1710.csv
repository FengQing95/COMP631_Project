JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen purists rejoice, JINYA IS AS LEGIT AS IT GETS! Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and ordered the Chachacha (for Garlic Lovers) rich flavorful broth, noodles cooked to perfect texture, an adequate portion of chasiu and a whole softboiled egg! Another great highlight of this restaurant is it's unique decor and large communal table, with a perfect view of the kitchen. Highly recommend this place for those looking to satisfy a hearty ramen craving without the worry of disappointment.
