The Pit Room////This place was pricey; the portions are a lot smaller than other places and honestly, I was super sad about paying $20 for that small amount of meat, but boy was it a pleasure for my tastebuds. As you can see from the photo, the bread was thick sliced, but not large by any means so hiding all that glorious meat and still hanging off the platter.
