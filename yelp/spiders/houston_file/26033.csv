The Pit Room////I kept getting told by friends to attend this establishment. I did and it was refreshing to see, inside the loop, a nearly authentic Texas Style Bar-B-Q house. I was impressed by the smell alone as you are parking. By the way, parking is challenging, especially if you are handicapped. The only thing I was not forewarned about was the cost of certain meals. I dine in a variety of places from high to low. I am the type that buys a meal and purchase to go orders for my family in bulk to taste test. I approach the servers and asked for a slab of ribs to go and brisket etc. They informed me that one rib (1) rib is $22.00. I was surprised that was more than the $19.00 pound of brisket I was ordering. I thought if I purchases two ribs, perhaps a tad would be discounted. Nope, smile, it would have been $44.00. Still curious what a $22.00 rib would taste like I added it still to my order. I got plenty of sides. Quart of Macaroni near $12 and other sides. Check out was quick and polite. I ordered tea. When I was given my cup and as I approach the tea station, the heavens parted and I heard trumpets! Why? They had PURE LEAF stations! All kinds. This is my tea of choice PERIOD. This tea is brewed to perfection. First place ever where I saw this brand at a restaurant. Good choice Pit Room! Bonus points! Now, as I hit the condiment stand. They had well quality spruced up cucumbers with fancier jalapeños and thought I saw some ghost peppers. Spice is my life so I grabbed my share. Tasty! I can see a culinary spread here and I can only assume the food would be the same. The seating area is tight, but they do have an outdoor area as well. It being rarely cold for Houston that day, I chose to stay inside. Smaller area, and hard wood seating. Dont just plop back into a seat carved out of wood itself. Not a good idea, ouch! The staff checks on you constantly to ask of your dining experience, bonus. Now let's try the $22 rib. It is juicy, fatty, good rubbing on top. Large, but not that large. Me living in Austin for quit awhile, I have had my share of hill country Bar-B-Q, not to mention, living in Nashville, TN as well. It's tasty, but not $22 tasty and per one tasty. The mustard potato salad was culinary decent. It wasn't over powering and had a good portion of boiled eggs. The jalapeño vinegar chips were tasty, but too salty took away from the taste of the chips. The brisket also decent. Good place, but they aren't the only Bar-B-Q place in town, so perhaps pricing should be reconsidered. Especially, the area of location. It isn't the safest area and parking should be more accessible. However, this is a pleasure of a place to visit for fellow meat eaters who aren't the typical community vegetarians.
