Uchi////OMAKASE: I've been here 4 times and each time has been absolutely amazing! The last 3 times, I have sat at the sushi bar and we've ordered the 10 course chef's tasting. For me, I think all the plates are delicious so I get the chef's choice for special occasions and I don't have to worry about what to pick. The tasting includes seasonal items on the menu and a few other items from the regular Uchi menu.
