Uchi////If you're looking at Uchi's menu and thinking "Well, I don't eat animals, so I'm out of luck here"- I am most pleased to inform you that you are incorrect! Uchi offers a full vegetarian menu with vegan options clearly marked, and even has a vegetarian social hour menu (because you need snacks to go with that nigori in the box, right?)
