Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let's see so to start off overall Snooze was great and I enjoyed enjoyed my meal! I had the Huevos Rancheros and a delicious Cranberry Mimosa as well as the Mmm Mmm Mimosa and I was feeling soooooo good afterwards. The food didn't take to long and only had to wait about 15 ministers to be sat, but service was great and I will definitely be coming back to try out new things, not sure how I'm not a regular here but I recommend it to most, they also have outside seating but it is to cold at the moment. Here, ya Snooze ya don't lose lol!
