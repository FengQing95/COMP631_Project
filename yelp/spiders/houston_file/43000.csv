Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Picked up a few pastries to bring with us back to Dallas. I was pleased they made it through the drive unscathed, and they tasted delicious even though we didn't eat them right away after originally picking up. We tried the almond croissant (sooo good, love that almond filling inside), pistachio croissant (very fun and tasty), and the kouign-amann (this was my S.O.'s favorite of the bunch). Next time we're in Houston we're going to stay for a full meal as well. These pastries are going to be a must every time we go down now!
