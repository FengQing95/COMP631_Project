Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Just a warning, get there early! The first time I stumbled in around 7:30am on a Tuesday and was seated almost immediately. But one Sunday I wanted to take a few friends to show them how great it was, and we ended up waiting for almost two hours. Granted we did get there at around 9:45 so it was to be somewhat expected.
