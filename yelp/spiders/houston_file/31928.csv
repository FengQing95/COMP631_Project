Local Foods////Gulf Shrimp, Blue Crab Sandwich with Green Goddess Dressing ($12) - 4.5 - Perhaps the best seafood sandwich I've had in Houston! The thick ciabatta-like bread stood up to the fresh and succulent pieces of shrimp and crab. Â The veggies and dressing definitely adds to the crispness and freshness of every bite.
