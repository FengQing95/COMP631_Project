JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA was good. Had the Brussel sprouts tempura (must dip in sauces on table for flavor), the chef special ramen and the spicy pork ramen. For convenience I might come back, but for true flavor and taste, i personally would rather make the drive to Chinatown. Not sure if everyone just hyped it up so I expected more, but I didn't find anything that really stood out. Nice place though.
