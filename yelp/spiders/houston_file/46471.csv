Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went in to have breakfast this morning and was disappointed by the morning attitude at Common Bond Montrose. With the exception of one employee, I was met with a distinct lack of interest. In fact, real hostility might be more appropriate. It does not seem that ordering a 14.00 breakfast sandwich demands much civility.
