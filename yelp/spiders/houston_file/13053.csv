JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Missy - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I appreciate your understanding of our extended wait times during peak hours. We try our best to seat everyone in a timely fashion, but at 89 seats, we are sometimes limited in how quickly we can turn our tables. Also, by no means whatsoever do we "rush along" our guests.
