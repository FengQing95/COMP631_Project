Baby Barnaby's////My corned beef and hash...did I tell you about the waffle yet? Anyway, I wasn't feeling the corned beef and hash. Though I applaud the size of the dish (huge), the corned beef was super dry, and there was an overabundance of skillet potatoes in the dish. Though the scrambled eggs atop the dish offset the corned beef and potato tasted, it wasn't enough to deem my dish the loser of the two dishes that morning (and, yes, I'm the guy at the table who always wants to have been the winner at ordering dishes).
