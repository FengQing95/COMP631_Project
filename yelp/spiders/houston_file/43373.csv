Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////No matter, I'll come back another time.  Have managed to get my hands on a chocolate croissant, fresh sourdough bread, pear nut bread and a caramel latte.  The croissant was insanely delicious.  My sister has tried everything -you heard me- on the menu and says most of it's fantastic.
