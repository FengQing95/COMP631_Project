Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So we were downtown and looking for a place to grab some breakfast. According to Yelps reviews this place seemed like a GO!  When we passed we immediately saw the line and thought should we go somewhere else & then we're curious now and decided to check in. The wait was 45min to and hour so we grabbed and Orange cup of Joe and sat at the tables beside the building. They were right on point as the wait was approximately 50 minutes. We sat down ordered our food and and our waitress (Mozzarella) was awesome she even heard me say I'd like to try the PB pancake and brought us out one on the house. I ordered an Egg White Omelette with Chicken Sausage, tomatoes and mushrooms with a side of Hash Browns & Corn Tortillas. Very very good and very filling.  The only thing I must add is that for a Healthy Fare it seemed a little greasy but otherwise amazing experience.
