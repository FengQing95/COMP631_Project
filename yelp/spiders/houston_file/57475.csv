Kata Robata////The Pork Belly with Fresh Papaya Salad was full of flavors and textures. I expected green papaya but it was actually ripened sweet papaya and I was not mad at it. The sweetness from the papaya rounded out the citrus background of the salad. The pork belly was crispy and the thinly sliced cabbage was dressed perfectly.
