Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is fine, but you have to pay for it with your sanity if you wish to visit on a weekend.

My prickly pear margarita was just a glass of simple syrup, and I couldn't hear my friends over the cacophony of one million people jammed into a small building plus top 40's music blaring over the speaker system.
