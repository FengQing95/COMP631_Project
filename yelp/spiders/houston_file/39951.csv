Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was in my Â "List to try". The ambiance was great and I saw pictures of the Shaved Pork Chop Sandwich so I had to try it. It wasn't flavored as much as it looks and was a bit dry since they do not have BBQ sauce (chops are dry rubbed). They did however had some type of pesto sauce which was good on it. The wedges were a little too large and burnt for me so I returned them. I will definitely return to this place, but will try something else.
