Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Come early and NO line. Got right in to a clean retro restaurant. The food, service and silverware is wonderful! Kinda brought me back to the 60s style restaurant without the teased hair. I got the "chicken Pot pie" with a side of link sausage and extra crispy hash browns! Was yummy yummy yummy!!!! Will definitely be back.
