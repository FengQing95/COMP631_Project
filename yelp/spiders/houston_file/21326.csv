Uchi////When we arrived, the hostess was very friendly. Didn't keep us waiting at all and seated us right away. We had a little baby with us, and wanted to make sure the baby will be seated ok and everything was perfect, they even bought us a highchair. We decided to squeeze her carseat in the booth seating, so people don't bump into her by accident. The restaurant itself have a very nice ambience. The look is modern and darker with low lighting. It will be a great place to have a date too.
