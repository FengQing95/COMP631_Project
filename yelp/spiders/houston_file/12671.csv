JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seating: This place is tiny. There is small 2 people booths, a couple of tables for four and then community seating in the center of the restaurant and seating at two different bars. Don't be afraid of community seating. It was actually nice to chat with people who had come to the restaurant before to see their suggestions.
