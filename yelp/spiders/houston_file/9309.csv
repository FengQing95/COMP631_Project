JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Omg the absolute best ramen! Â I've been to Japan twice and this is better than any Ramen that I ever had there. Get the Tonkatsu Black. It has the creamy pork broth and will make you dream of it for days to come. Super busy if you go anytime around 7 PM but that's also because they are the best.
