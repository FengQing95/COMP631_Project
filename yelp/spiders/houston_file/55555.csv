Kata Robata////Conveniently located on Kirby drive, Kata Robata is not just about an upscale feel and gorgeous ambience but also offers a fantastic variety of fresh sushi and Japanese tapas. The lychee drink (their little twist on lychee martini) is unique and yummy. We tried tons of sashimi and loved every bite. The only disappointing dish was the spicy soy ramen which was not at all spicy but rather sweet.
