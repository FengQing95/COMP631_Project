Kata Robata////Overall, everything was delicious! The quality of their fish is amazing and fresh, definitely top notch. My favorite item was the toro uni caviar sushi. You get blue fin tuna with sea urchin and caviar on top. Ugh soooo good. I thought the uni pasta was just okay. It had more of a mushroom flavor that was overpowering, and I wish there were more pieces of uni in it. I probably wouldn't order the uni pasta again. Anyway, I can't wait for my next visit to Kata Robata!
