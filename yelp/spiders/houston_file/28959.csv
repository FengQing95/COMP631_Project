The Pit Room////My favourite BBQ in Houston. Yes it is busy and yes you may struggle to get a seat right away but it is worth it. Â Go in a group and get someone to snag a seat while you queue, I tasted a variety, the brisket, sausage and pulled pork were all so satisfying to eat. If you are only in town for a couple days this has to be the place to go!
