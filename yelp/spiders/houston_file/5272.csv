JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I met friends here and we sat at the long communal table. It was soooo much fun. We agreed the ramen was the best in Houston and I liked the ability to add an extra egg and the wait staff told us we could ask for another portion of noodles to add to the soup if we wished. My friend got her leftovers to go with the added noodles, good idea. The white wine was outstanding and well priced, a bottle for $22.
