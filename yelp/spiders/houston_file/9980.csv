JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been craving really good ramen since moving back to the States from South Korea.  However, since I don't like to drive into Houston let alone Austin I thought I'd never get it again.  Then JINYA opened in CLEAR LAKE and made me hope again.  We love going here (probably too much).  I always get the Spicy Chicken (Hot) with a seasoned egg and sometimes I'll add the chicken wontons as additions.  I like the Jinya bun as an app and the curry rice as a side.  My husband always (and I mean always) gets the Tonkotsu Black.  The service here has always been top notch and we love the little greeting that they do when they seat their patrons.  My husband also likes yelling it out for other people, lol.
