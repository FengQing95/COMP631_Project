Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the Green Eggs. Delicious! Every element in the dish was perfect. The potatoes were definitely one of the best I've had, chicken apple sausage was a wonderful change from the usual and the eggs were nice and creamy. I saw the patrons from the table next to us eye-ing my dish and when they left they asked what it was since they said it looked so good. And it was =)
