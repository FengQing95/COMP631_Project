Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food here is great! A bit on the expensive side, but might be worth it. Â The chilaquiles tested so much like a Frito pie that it really soothe my southern boy soul. The Bosscat Fries are these large wedges with a bit of a smoked flavoring that are seasoned really well There's a whiskey-coffe cocktail that was too delightful (and it comes with a piece of biscotti that's perfect for dipping!)
