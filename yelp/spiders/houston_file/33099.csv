Local Foods////As for the sides, I'm an eater but not a lover of beets so the beets didn't wow me. They were slightly sweet and good. On the other hand, I'm notoriously known for eating olives while intoxicated at bars so I was all over the green olive side. As for the coffee, I believe they use the Katz's blend for benjy's. It's decent but I wasn't in love.
