Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We had croissants-- plain and almond chocolate and they were perfection. You definitely get what you pay for! The cappuccinos were spot on, but the coffee bar was soooo slow and it wasn't even busy! Had my coffee been made in a timely fashion 5 stars it would have been.
