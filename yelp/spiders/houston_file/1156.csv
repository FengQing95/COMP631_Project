JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here a couple times and enjoyed it every time - I just didn't love it. Need to pay extra for usual staple toppings (egg) and the other side dishes were just meh. The actual ramen was good but not mind blowing. Service has always been good to me. Come here if you need that midtown vibe but don't need an amazing food experience.
