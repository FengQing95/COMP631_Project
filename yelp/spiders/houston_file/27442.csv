The Pit Room////Here work a work trip and I told my boss I wanted a REAL TEXAS MEAL. We came here and this is what I got pulled pork, brisket, Mac and cheese and green beans. I don't know what's in their greens but it better than fat back being in lol. Seriously if your a local or coming in for work HAVE TO COME HERE.
