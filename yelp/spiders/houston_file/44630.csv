Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has to be one of my favorite Houston coffee shops. I discovered this little gem while taking my pup to the vet. I stopped in and got an amazing latte and an almond croissant. I love the bright airy feel of the interior. A bar placed along a long window lends for a pretty view of passerby. They have tons of great treats macaroons, ( these are my favorite of all the ones I've tried) croissants, cookies, brownies, you name it. They have regular coffee choices as well as specialty lattes. Try the pain perdu ( very similar to French toast, but better) the quaint atmosphere and delicious coffee and food make it one of my top places to visit when I am in the city.
