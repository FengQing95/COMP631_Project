Local Foods////This place has a lovely atmosphere, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste of the food. Although the foods are made local ingredients, the taste of the kale salad (which many people talk about) was not great. Despite it's 'healthy food' approach, I'd rather go home and cook or make a salad than go here and pay a high price to eat healthy.
