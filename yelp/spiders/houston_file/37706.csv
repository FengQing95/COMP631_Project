Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Drinks: Cocktails = not very Â many on the menu, but a couple sounded interesting. Although , I ordered a Straight Martini(not on menu, with blue cheese stuffed olives, the waiter asked bartender to prepare some for me:) . For dinner I just had some of their "house" chardonnay .My hubby got some beer on tap , girlfriend requested a French 75(also out of menu) it with por she liked it.
