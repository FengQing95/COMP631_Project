Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Okay, so now the name of this restaurant makes all the sense in the world... they named it Snooze because after you eat all that delicious food, you're bound to go back home and fall into a deep, pleasurable sleep! I don't even know where to begin. SMH. First, we both had a breakfast cocktail. I had a peach mimosa but I can't recall what he had. What I do know is that they were both great. We got the OMG French Toast, an omelette with chicken sausage, spinach and cheese and our waiter brought out something additional for us which was the cinnamon roll pancake. Everything was awesome.
