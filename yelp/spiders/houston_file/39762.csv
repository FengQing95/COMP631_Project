Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We were greeted at the door by one of the happiest individuals that has ever hosted. She literally danced between customers. Our waitress, Iman, was "training". Not as a waitress, but as a banquet manager. She impressed in every way, to the point we had no clue she was training. The staff clearly love working here and it is obvious. Jose, who gave us the tour of the whiskey room was on point, knowledgeable and very customer oriented. Everyone smiles, hustled and helps one another.
