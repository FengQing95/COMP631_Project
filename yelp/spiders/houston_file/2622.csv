JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Aromatic, savory, and consistent. JINYA Ramen is probably one of the better, if not the best, ramen shop in Houston. But that isn't saying too much since the ramen scene is seriously lacking compared to other cities like San Francisco or NYC. It does beat out many of the other Japanese restaurants here in Houston that do serve ramen and even other ramen dedicated restaurants. JINYA has two broths (well three if you include veggie-friendly) of either chicken or pork both of which has a pleasantly thick broth that sticks to your mouth (you want that!). The flavors are not as rich or intense as traditional tonkatsu soups but are still nonetheless tasty. This place also likes their green onion and garlic so keep that in mind if you don't want fresh garlicky breath but you'd be missing out on the extra depth of flavor their black garlic oil brings to their ramen. I've enjoyed their ramens each time I've visited and it's usually my best bet if I'm craving legitimate ramen.
