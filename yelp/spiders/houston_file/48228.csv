Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait was a little over an hour which was expected for a Sunday at noon. Not only is the food is totally worth the wait but they also have a waitress who takes drink orders from the patio area outside and complimentary coffee while you wait which helped make the wait more tolerable too.
