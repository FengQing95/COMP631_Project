Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ever since discovering Snooze a few months ago, I have never been able to eat breakfast food the same. I have been back to snooze every two weeks, and I'm still in love with this place! My favorite meal is their pancake flight where you can choose a selection of 3 pancakes. I go with the pineapple upside down, blueberry Danish, and cake of the day. Sometimes when I'm not feeling too hungry I'll just get the pineapple upside down single cake for $4.50. In addition, I get an egg and hash browns as a salty side.
