Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came in at 12:45p on a Saturday.  Waited in line outside at first (only about 3 people deep) and then inside for a total of almost 30 min!  By the time we got to the from they were sold out of croissants and THREE of the entrees that we were going to buy.  I mean, come ON...supply and demand.
