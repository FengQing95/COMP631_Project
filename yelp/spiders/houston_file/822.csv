JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Husband and I finally got away from our little one to try this place and it was the best!!!!! We started off with pork gyoza and fried brussel sprouts. The sprouts were tasteless i feel like i needed some good ranch to go along with it. They gyozas on the other hand were delish! The only thing.. I didnt like that the gyoza sauce is already set on the table so the oil is seperated. I did shake it but you could still see the cold oil when you pour it. Major downer. So thats why i gave 4 stars. Husband got the tonkotsu assari which i loved wayy more than my spicy chicken ramen! Everything was great. Atmosphere. Staff. ALThough we couldnt tell who to tip bc two people kept helping us. Got a table pretty quick that i cant complain. Experience over all was great. We will be going back and with emptier stomachs! Lol!
