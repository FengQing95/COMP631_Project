JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We gave Jinya another try and had a much better experience. It probably helped given the fact that when we went, there was not a lot of people there. We were seated promptly and had a friendly waitress. Our food came out decently quick and as always, the ramen was great. We had the tonkotsu black. The broth was very good. This time, we did not have to wait forever to get our checks. Everything went quickly and smoothly. I'll most likely return again.
