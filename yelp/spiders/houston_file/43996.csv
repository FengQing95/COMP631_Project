Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The chocolate chip cookie was amazing. If I could make cookies like that, I would have been married at like 20. The eclair was...meh. I didn't really care for the profiterole part. The profiterole part was probably in it's last stages of freshness, and the last one I had was in Paris. So my standards were a bit high.
