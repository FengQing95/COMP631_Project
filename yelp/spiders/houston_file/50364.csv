Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'd say the best thing about this place is they cater to your needs when ordering. All the Benedict options essentially had pork or beef. They have soy chorizo and tofu and other options to sub! Most places charge for minor changes which I always think is so annoying. Not here!
