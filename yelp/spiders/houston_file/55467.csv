Kata Robata////This time I got the scallop and foie gras sushi special with some fresh salmon and a piece of uni nigiri. The foie gras is sweet and flavorful while the scallop has a soft and not-springy texture. There wasn't that strong seafood aftertaste that normally comes with raw seafood that has been sitting out for a while; again, the quality here is unquestionably great. Same thing with the uni; it's buttery and flavorful but not too fishy, just the right amount of fishiness.
