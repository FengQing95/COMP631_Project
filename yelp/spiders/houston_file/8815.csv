JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wendy who was our server, was friendly and had great energy even during the end of her 16 hr shift! She made good recommendations for my boyfriend and I. She recommended that I get the spicy miso Tonkatsu with level inferno spice, which are both off the menu. I highly recommend as well if you like a spicy, thick and hearty broth! I added tofu and Bok choy. I also got an extra order of noodles which I realized I didn't need because my bowl was super full when I first got it (lunch for tomorrow yay!)! She recommended the Tonkatsu white for my boyfriend. He added bean sprouts, an extra egg, bok choy, and made his broth spicy.
