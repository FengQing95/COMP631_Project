Uchi////I do also have to comment on how well-rounded the dishes tasted. Everything was so balanced, and it was so delightfully light. The balance of flavors in each dish caught me by surprise- there really wasn't one dish that was disappointing. By the end of the meal, even though we were both satisfied, neither of us felt bloated, or too full. It was just a great experience.
