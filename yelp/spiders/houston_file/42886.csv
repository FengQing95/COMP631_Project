Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is a great place to grab your laptop and a cup of coffee-oh and perhaps be talked into one of their AMAZING snacks they have prepared. When you get tired of Starbucks and want a fun, authentic, and delicious place to work then head here.  Their pastries are out of this world-sinful cookies, delicious little cakes, and breads that you would disown your grandmother for.
