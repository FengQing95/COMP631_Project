JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Shalu - Thank you for the great review! We greatly appreciate your kind words regarding just about everything -- on behalf of my entire staff, thank you. I'm also glad our service met your needs and expectations since that is as equally important to us as the food itself. Although you began your review claiming not to be a ramen connoisseur, I was pretty convinced by the end of your review that you are one! Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
