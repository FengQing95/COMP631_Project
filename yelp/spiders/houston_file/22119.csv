Uchi////I absolutely loved everything I had for dinner at Uchi. I am a super fan of this restaurant. The sweet sake was amazing. The ribs were so tender it was ridiculous. We had some sushi rolls, caramel Brussels sprouts, some kind of fish I can't remember the name of... but trust me, every single thing was cooked to perfection. We also received a complementary dish from the chef. I wish I would have written this review earlier because now I can't remember all the dishes we had, but know that I will definitely be back. Their happy hour is awesome too!
