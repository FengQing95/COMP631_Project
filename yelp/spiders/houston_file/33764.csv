Local Foods////Don't even get me started on the sides. I always have such trouble deciding what I want, because you get 2 sides (or a soup) and I love ALL of their sides. I get their squash salad (tossed in curry seasoning) when I want something more savory and rich, their kale salad when I'm feeling something light, chips (made in-house and seasoned with what is probably crack salt) when I'm really hungry, or quinoa (it's flavored SO well - I think they cook it in some vegetable/chicken stock).
