Local Foods////The pretzel buns here are to die for!  Actually, all the breads the sandwiches are served on are great.  All sandwiches come with either your choice of 2 sides or a cup of soup.  My favorite sides are the Cabbage Slaw and Beets.  The posole is a good choice if you're in the mood for soup.
