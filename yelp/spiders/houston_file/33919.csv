Local Foods////I'm a little late on joining in on the Local Foods bandwagon, but I love this place! I've been eyeing this place for a while, but haven't gotten a chance to go out to Rice Village in a while. We ventured to Local Foods for an impromptu Girl's Night and knew it was kismet when we scored a parking space right in front of the restaurant.
