Baby Barnaby's////I got the steak and eggs. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The potatoes were delicious. The toast was very good. I asked for my eggs to be scrambled. The prices are so cheap here. For about 4 people, it was $40 for brunch. A friend of mine ordered the corned beef hash with green eggs (add $1 for green eggs) and it was delicious. I just took a bite and I would definitely get this dish as well.
