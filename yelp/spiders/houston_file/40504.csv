Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very nice and spacious restaurant inside a plaza. They hold late hours. A fight broke out while we were there and the cops were called. In fact, the drunk guy that instigated the fight with another person there, happen to land on our rental car when he got punched (thankfully no damage was done to the car). The drunk guy was yelling out offensive stuff to multiple people. Although there was much commotion and attention on the fight, I was tipsy and starving so I asked the hostess at the front how much the box of mini donuts (from some other company?) at the front cost, and she gave me two for free because she felt bad about the fight. They actually ended up being dry, but I didn't care, I was hungry. Aside from that, I'd order everything we got again: candied pork belly, broccolini, pork chop, and short rib. I was bummed that they were out of the whiskey okra (I think that's what it was), hopefully I'll get a chance to return and try it.
