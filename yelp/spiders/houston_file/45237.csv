Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Awesome location and cool ambiance for pretty good eats and amazing/fluffy chocolate chip cookies. I got the chicken torta sandwich which was not as memorable as the chocolate chip cookies! The location is pretty prime if you want to peruse through montrose/thrift shopping afterwards. They also have quite a bit of extra parking further back from the Main Street, which made things a lot easier since sometimes parking at a restaurant in more inner Houston can get sticky.
