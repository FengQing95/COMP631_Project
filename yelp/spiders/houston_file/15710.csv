JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Every time I come here I get the garlic lovers cha cha cha and it never disappoints. Except maybe this last time I was kind of not super excited about it but the other 4 times I've been it's been pretty consistent. Nice and creamy and full of flavor. I always add an extra egg. And I freaking love thick ramen noodles! Soo good!
