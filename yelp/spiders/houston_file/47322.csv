Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is definitely too hyped up. There are a couple of locations in the US so I thought I'd give it a try... it was ok. Nothing too out of this world for brunch/breakfast foods. On top of that, they poured the entire container of hollandaise sauce on my eggs benedict. Not a fan.
