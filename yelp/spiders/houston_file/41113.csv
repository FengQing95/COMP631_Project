Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the two sided window enclosure that houses such a cute interior as well. I must say it was a little confusing to order the first time one of my best friends brought me here for my birthday. There were two different stations, but we never saw a sign that said "start here" but that may have been from the excitement we were feeling since we had been wanting to try it out. We ordered food and a ton of baked goods and sat down at a huge communal table - I like the idea of people being closer and perhaps making friends with the person/people nearby. The staff were very friendly and came by all the time to ensure our experience would be a great one. I must say the few small reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5 are the priceyness of the place, the short hours, the early kitchen closure and it being closed on a Monday. Overall, very good experience for us and our tummies! Will return eventually.
