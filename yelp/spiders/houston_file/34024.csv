Local Foods////This place is crazy...1,000+ reviews, 4.5 stars...for a lunch place. That's pretty good. And I agree. Local Foods is really a great lunch spot. We walked around the gorgeous campus at Rice beforehand and since Local Foods had been on my radar, we made the quick drive over. Parking on the street was a breeze and the line wasn't too bad on a Saturday.
