Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Right off the bat, I was turned off by the valet parking at lunch on a weekday (really?) and has to go searching for a spot on the street. I'm allergic to valet in a city like houston with ample parking everywhere. Place is cute, fries are delicious, but nothing else is impressive. We ended up sitting in the front on high bar stools (uncomfortable). Waiter was friendly but took forever to come take our orders and deliver beverages. The burger I ordered was not juicy or very tasty. Charged me $2 for cheese - and it's not gooey melted cheese. It's like shaved Parmesan or something. Trying to get too fancy. Perhaps it has a good evening bar scene? But I wouldn't come back for the food.
