Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'd been wanting to try this place for a while, and I finally got around to it! My friend and I came here around 6:45 am, and the parking lot and the restaurant were pretty empty. I ordered the Benny Duo with a Bella Bella Benny (prosciutto) and a Benny Goodman (lox). When the food arrived, I thought the eggs Benedicts looked really small, but there was a nice heap of hash browns to balance it out (and a small salad). Everything on the plate was absolutely delicious -- the hash browns, the hollandaise, the salmon/prosciutto.... And the poached eggs ran nicely as well. I was afraid the meal wasn't going to be filling, but somehow by the end my stomach was stuffed. I do think the menu was a little pricey for the amount of food given, so even though it was delicious I wouldn't be able to come back here very often. Service was also a little slow: I think based on where our table was situated, we had trouble getting the waiter's attention sometimes. Overall, I'm really happy I finally tried Snooze as the food was amazing, but I don't think it will become a super regular stop. I definitely recommend checking it out, though.
