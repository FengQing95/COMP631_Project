Kata Robata////Oh come on Houston!  This is the best sushi you got?  What a HUGE let down!  Not even two bottles of sake made this food taste better.  From the kobe beef skewers (was that really kobe, cause all I got was FAT) to the spicy tuna roll (who could mess that up), all I am left with is one big disappointment!
