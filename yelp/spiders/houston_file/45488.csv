Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had been anticipating coming here for awhile. Did not disappoint although idk about 350 for a chocolate chip cookie. Even though it's 2 cookies worth, just seems over the top for a cookie. Amann was on point excellent . Cheesecake was silky delicious . Coffee was also great . Would return for the iced coffee and amann for sure
