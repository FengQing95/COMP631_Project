Baby Barnaby's////But one day woke up and decided to go there on a Tuesday morning and I don't regret it. So we got there and signed in and waited for like 5 mins and got seated. Then we ordered our food, which was the breakfast plate I believe and I ordered the green eggs. So we got our food and I didn't realize how much the proportions were so we had left overs yummmm. Those potatoes hit the spot. Then we left full and happy with leftover :)
