Uchi////I been here 2 times and both times were great. Both times I went in t-shirt, shorts and flip flops and no problems. I would recommend the happy hr because there is one pork dish Â that is only served at happy hour and its absolutely amazing. the decor is very nice. A lot of detail went into the design and just like any high end restaurant in houston the mood lighting is dim. the two times i went we didnt have to wait to sit. First time we sat at the bar and second time the community table both times it was 4of us. tables are usually always reserved out and its even a long wait if you reserved a table.
