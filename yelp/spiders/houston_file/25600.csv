Uchi////Uchi is incredible. I don't think they make a bad dish.  The omakase is one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. My husband and I went to celebrate his birthday and got the omakase and whatever was the best from the social hour menu. Pro tip, go during social hour, as you will get happy hour prices on what they bring you for that menu.   I didn't want to stop eating.  The service is impeccable and the food is to die for. This is the best splurge meal in Houston.
