JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best broth hands downs. I wish there is more seating (bigger space) the wait by the awkward bar area is really irritating. Friendly staff, great appetizers (creamy spicy shrimp) Â my kids likes the plain chicken ramen. They can't have enough. We visit every chance we are near by.
