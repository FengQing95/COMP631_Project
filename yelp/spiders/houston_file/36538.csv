Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The sweet potato mac & cheese is amazing, but the Korean short rib bowl was phenomenal. The blend of flavors could not be improved & who would think that corn and parmesan would be so delicious. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and the drinks were flavorful. It's a little pricey, but worth every penny.
