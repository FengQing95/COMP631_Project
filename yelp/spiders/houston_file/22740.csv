Uchi////I lived in Houston for 7 years before I actually tried Uchi, and I don't know how I will ever eat any other sushi again... It's that serious. Excuse me for not being fancy, but the first think I noticed was that there was no soy sauce on the table... so I was a little worried about that. Same when the sushi was actually served, no soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger. So not SUSHI, right? Wrong. If you put any of those things on the sushi they serve you, you are a monster! :) Every piece is literally a masterpiece, and infused with the best flavors.. so leave it alone!
