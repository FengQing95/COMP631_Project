Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I settled on the french onion soup which was on the menu and a delicious looking ham and cheese crossoint sandwich behind the counter. I was served the sandwich right away and the soup was brought to my table. Â I thought I was going to have to fight for a table because of the crowd, but it was I was surprised that tables open up very quickly. There is seating inside and outside. On a beautiful day like today it was lovely to sit outside.
