Uchi////Came here on a Wednesday night and was fortunate enough to try the 10 course tasting menu compliments of my friend Maria A. who treated me for my birthday. The attention to detail in the preparation of the food resulted in a beautiful modern presentation which matched the ambiance and decor of the establishment.  I appreciated the verbal explanations of each course and the suggestion of how to eat each one. We interacted with several servers and the chefs which allowed for a dynamic experience.  Every item we tried was fantastic, creative and well balanced.  This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype and is a must for anyone who is a foodie looking for a special experience. It definitely elevates the Houston dining scene ranking it up there with dining cities such a NYC and Los Angeles.
