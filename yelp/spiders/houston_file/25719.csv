Uchi////This is my favorite happy hour! This place does not disappoint. I always order the ham and egg roll and the brussel sprouts. The ham and egg roll is my favorite! I could eat 5. :) I always eat at the sushi bar and the chefs are always super nice and attentive. Both times I have gone, the sushi chefs have given me free dessert! I have tried the pistachio ice cream and the fried milk. Both are incredible! I love this place! The parking is valet only so I usually park on the street or valet my car if I am carrying cash.
