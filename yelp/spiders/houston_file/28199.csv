The Pit Room////If you are craving spicy bbq - this is your place. The menu is broad enough to please anyone. The sides (especially the mustard potato salad) are all good, but equally spicy. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. The staff was great and the food delicious. It is a great addition to the Montrose food scene.
