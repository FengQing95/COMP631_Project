The Pit Room////We've been to The Pit Room several times now and every time is never a disappointment. The brisket is always moist and delicious. I'm happy that after a while, they haven't dropped in their quality. This is our go to BBQ place when we need our BBQ fix. The staff is also very friendly and we were always checked on to see if we were happy with our food at our table. I highly recommend going here. You will not be disappointed. Even my very picky 9 year old cleans her plate here!
