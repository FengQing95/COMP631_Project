Kata Robata////the only star is for food because it is good, but service is terrible and they are very discriminating! When I sat between two white customer, the server would constantly ask them how everything is ? Do they need anything else? Do they need dessert?, even he would talk jokes with them, but he never spoke me at all after I order, not even for the water, after I finished, he gave check to people next to me, but I got wait another 15 minutes, and finally he gave me the check, after I complained to the manager, the manager even laughed at the discriminating things, it is a terrible experience! Never gonna go back there again!
