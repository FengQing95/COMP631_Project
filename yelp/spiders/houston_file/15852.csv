JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Natasha - Thank you for your excellent review. We appreciate your recommendations and your business. We Â do regret that due to our demand at peak hours, we must strictly enforce our seating policy. We do have six JINYA locations throughout the greater Houston area, all of which are usually much less crowded than Midtown. Regardless, we appreciate your kind words and hope you'll come back through again soon!
