Kata Robata////My forbidden fruit cocktail was delicious and refreshing, and I would order it again. My favorite course of the night was the Kobe beef skewers. They were so tender and flavorful and the fat melted in your mouth. Kata deserves five stars solely on the merit of this dish alone. The amberjack and foie gras was an interesting flavor combination with an artistic presentation. We also had two sushi rolls topped with jalapeños and one with garlic chili sauce and jalapeños. They were good and the tempura inside was crisp, but nothing special in my opinion.
