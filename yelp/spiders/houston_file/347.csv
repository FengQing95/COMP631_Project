JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I do have an additional question: Did you place your order via DoorDash, Favor or Postmates? The bartending staff informed me that a DoorDash employee called in an order last night for one of their clients, but misspoke the order on the phone (the DoorDash employee called in a JINYA Chicken Ramen instead of a Hiyashi Cold Ramen). So when the DoorDash delivery person arrived, he had to wait for the correct ramen to be prepared after spending several minutes clarifying the error.
