Kata Robata////You can never go wrong with scallop nigiri, himachi w/quail egg, uni, and foie gras nigiri. The foie gras nigiri is so good that I sometimes come just to order it! Try some of the happy hour appetizers that are nicely priced for small bites like the salmon carpaccio. My shishito mojito was refreshing for the sizzling Houston heat so I recommend that you grab one when dining.
