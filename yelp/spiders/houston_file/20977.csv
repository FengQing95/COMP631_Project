Uchi////This place is damn good.  I've been here twice and each time have had wonderful service and food.  Last experience was with 4 friends and we decided on the 10 course chef's table.  The only thing we didn't like was some cooked fish that was incredible FISHY and full of bones.  Other than that, our servers were on point, extremely knowledgeable and entertaining and the food was delicious (they are very creative with their dishes).  If you're looking for a unique sushi experience, go to Uchi.   Thumbs up!
