Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Order at the front counter and weave your way down the line of breads, cakes and pastries. Note that they also offer proper breakfast and lunch options like biscuits and gravy topped with over easy eggs. The lattes and cappuccinos are top notch. If you're planning to make holiday orders - be prepared to do so in advance. They pop up a tent and make a whole production of it. (This place is no secret, you guys)
