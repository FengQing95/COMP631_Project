JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best noodles I've had so far. Beautiful set up and feels very at home. Only complaint I have is the wait time but it's not their fault they're food is so awesome that all of Houston wants to be there. If you don't want to wait, I recommend you go during the week. Cause the weekends are pretty busy. And it's a huge perk that they are open late! Would definitely recommend. Yum!
