Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food: Decent. Had higher expectations than what the food came to be- baby barnaby's blows this place out of the water (with a much shorter wait and efficient staff). Ordered Breakfast hash- Found my eggs to be WAY too greasy, had a weird clear film of grease. I get it is brunch and I like greasy food but this was over the top. Hash was decent but nothing to write home about. My bf got the eggs benedict and wasnt impressed- didnt even finish them (same egg grease problem) but loved the hashbrowns.
