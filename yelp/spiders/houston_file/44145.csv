Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love the revolving menu. Keeping things fresh and interesting. Totally worthy the wait. Mind you there are some overly pretentious people who think they own that place. These morons basically thought they owned a table and the chair that was overlapping the one I was sitting in, they learned real quick like not to poke the bear. (; Get over yourself already. The staff and foods make up for those.
