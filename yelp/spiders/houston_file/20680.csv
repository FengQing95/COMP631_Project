Uchi////Happy Hour at Uchi is from 5pm-630pm. When we got there at a quarter or so to 6pm there was still plenty of parking and tables so we were seated right away. Be warned, they will not seat you if your full party is not there. Lucky for us, they gave us a four person table for two which later became a party of three.
