Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Because of the time that we showed up, about 10 minutes after we sat down, the kitchen made its last call, so we quickly got in our food order: I had the Pork Belly Poutine and my friend had the Bosscat Burger. Both dishes were amazing! The poutine is a nice twist on the Canadian staple, oozing and overflowing with gravy, mingling with the squeaky cheese and savory pork belly. The burger was also bursting with flavour, and perfectly cooked.
