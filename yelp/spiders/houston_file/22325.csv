Uchi////I have a food instagram and recommended Uchi to many people in the past. When I recommend Uchi now, I will now be adding the caveat that I only recommend the locations in Austin and Dallas and not the one in Houston. I loved Uchi so much that it is actually what I put down in my yelp profile as "My Last Meal on Earth." I have now added that caveat to not go to the one in Houston. So incredibly disappointing.
