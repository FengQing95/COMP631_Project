JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Joyce - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen and that you're one of our "JINYA Regulars." I happen to agree with you regarding the noise; in fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise.
