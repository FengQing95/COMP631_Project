The Pit Room////I've had the Pit Room several times and it always is so fresh. I had not tried the charro beans and elote til today; great choice! The beans had a spice, so beware but nothing no one can't handle. Oh and the side of pickles were different; they were cucumbers soaked in a unique vinaigrette or so.
