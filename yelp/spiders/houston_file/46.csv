Local Foods////My fiancee and I were debating between Buffalo Wild Wings and Zoe's Kitchen (I know, two extremes) We ended up walking towards ThaiSpice and at the last second, he fakes me out and goes towards Local Foods. I asked about the switch and he said the decor just looked like they had good food. HE WAS RIGHT!! We looked lost and the guy at the register couldn't have been nicer about it. He genuinely helped us but not in a "heres every ingredient in every item" kinda way but in a, this is the rundown of Local Foods. We split a Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, which came with two sides so we picked the kale salad and potato salad. He got a beer as well and tipped the guy a few bucks. All in all, our bill was under $20. All of it was beyond amazing. You can't go wrong with any of those choices, no matter how strongly against kale you think you may be. Besides the genuine personality of all the staff (everyone was helpful, friendly, seemed genuinely happy to work there) the best part is the MINT-ADE (i think thats the name, I was blinded by the awesomeness that is this drink) Since he knew we had never been there before, he offered us a glass on the house. This juice is enough to make me come back. Its a combination orange, grapefruit and mint, I think. If they served it with vodka, I'd give them 6 stars.
