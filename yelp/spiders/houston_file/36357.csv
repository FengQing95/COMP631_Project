Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My cousin had her birthday brunch at this restaurant. The live DJ and customer service were very good. I'm a health food nut and there weren't many options on the menu for people trying to avoid overindulging. I ordered the almond flour pancakes with eggs and chicken sausage. It was pretty good.
