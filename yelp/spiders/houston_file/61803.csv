Baby Barnaby's////I have been going to baby barnaby's for 15 years and still think their green eggs breakfast to be the most delicious and comforting brunch I have ever had. We usually arrive between noon to 1 pm, where it's about 30-40 min before we're seated. I completely expect this, so I don't mind the wait. We would walk around the neighborhood during this time, where we always come across several friendly stray cats. Service has been consistently excellent for us - granted we do our best to be polite and always tip well. We love that the owner and manager of the restaurant aren't afraid to get their hands dirty to help the staff clean tables, bring out dishes, etc. We will always be back.
