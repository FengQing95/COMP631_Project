Local Foods////The food here is delicious and the atmosphere is amazing. So far, I would definitely recommend the crunchy chicken sandwich and the roasted short ribs sandwich. All the sides are also so good. I would recommend the quinoa and kale. Both are seasoned well and pack a lot of favor. I didnt know quinoa and kale can taste so good. If my parents gave me that as a kid, I would definitely eat them.
