Uchi////I am officially hooked on the gyutoro yaki. It's short rib that is cooked for 72 Hour s that melts in your mouth like butter! If you haven't had it you seriously need to. The Salmon nigiri is another one of my faves and the beef hot rocks are amazing as well. If you can try to request the edamame-jalape√±o sauce that they use for the uchi salad. It's delicious on pretty much everything!
