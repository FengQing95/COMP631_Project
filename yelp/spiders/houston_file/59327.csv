Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is more of a standout than regular Barnaby's, which in my opinion is good but not awesome.  The atmosphere is cozy and fresh, plus all of the food is fantastic.  It can get crowded, so weekdays are best.  If you can't make a weekday, try to go early on the weekend, or at least send one of your party to get on the list.  They won't seat you with only part of your group, but you can get on the list.
