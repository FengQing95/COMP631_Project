Baby Barnaby's////The only negative thing I can possibly say about baby barnaby's is that I can't call it my own personal secret anymore. It's almost impossible to get in for breakfast many weekend mornings, so I make it my go to any time I have a weekday off when the rest of the world doesn't. Â Great food, great service, and not on a major thoroughfare.
