Uchi////Majority of the staff were very knowledgeable, explained every dish, it was our first time there and the community table works. It's not your Americanized sushi restaurant. It's one of the authentic sushi Japanese restaurant. I would mind paying that much if I went to other restaurants I've been to in Houston, but this kind is similar to Geisha House in LA quality. Geisha House is more posh, and centered their menu, but I like the fact Uchi changes its menu every few days to what is freshly available. Makes it unique
