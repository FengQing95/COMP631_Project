Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also enjoy the coffee and cookies here, but I would say those are a 4/5. I just love the croissants so much that it brings this place to a 5. On top of that, the atmosphere is good for catching up with friends. All the windows allow for lots of natural light, and what's not to like about that?
