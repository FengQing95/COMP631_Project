Local Foods////Prices aren't overwhelming, between our two meals and drinks spent about $30. Service was good, seating was plenty though it can get backed around lunch time and afternoon. Location is great if you want to spend some walking the strip after eating. In the end, decent place, would recommend to anyone wanting to try something quaint and local.
