Local Foods////As for the soups and sides, I had their posole once and it was very limey. It wasn't very exciting or authentic and didn't have much content to it. I like their lemongrass chicken soup better. It's light but wholesome (if those can go together). I think they can do better with their quinoa. I'd like it if it was a little sweet. I hate their kale, but I'm not a fan of kale to begin with. I force myself to eat it. I tell myself, "Verna, kale is a super food packed with plenty of nutrients. Eat it now!" I usually don't like slaw, but it's decent here, because they put a zesty spin on it.
