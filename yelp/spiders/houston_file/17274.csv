JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was the first time in a really long time that I've had ramen and it did not disappoint! I grew up in Asia and the pork dumplings tasted really authentic! I've also recently gotten the Jinya Chicken Ramen as carry-out and I liked how they keep everything separate so you can assemble it at home. That being said, I did enjoy it more at the restaurant, maybe because it was a little more fresh but probably just because the restaurants vibes are great!
