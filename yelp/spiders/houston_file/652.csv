JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I almost don't want to post a rating and drive more traffic here.  Food is always top notch and the service great.  Their ramen is more innovative regarding ingredients and has more depth of flavor than anything else I've eaten in town.  I eat here about once every other month for lunch.  Have not had a bad meal yet.  There can be a bit of a line during lunch time.
