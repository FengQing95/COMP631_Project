Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A co-worker brought me a piece of lemon cake from this place.  It was solid.  About an inch thick with enough lemon flavor to know what I was eating, but I would have liked a little more.  Felt a little bland to me.  It's very heavy... in fact, I think it's time for a nap.
