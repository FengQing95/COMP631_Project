Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't even begin to describe to you the unbelievable amazingness that you can find at common bond! I picked up two scones (not knowing the flavor) and two chocolate molten fudge brownie chocolate macaroons. I'm pretty sure it's just called a chocolate macaroon but I'm just describing the delectableness that it was.
