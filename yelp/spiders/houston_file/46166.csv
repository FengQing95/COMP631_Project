Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now for the brunch items. I came in with a friend looking for the same level of quality. Aside from an exceptional fluffiness in the scrambled eggs, they fell short of even lesser franchise brunch spots. Their hash/potato side was made in the form of a cube, mixing cheese and other ingredients together but it came out with too many flavors mixing and not any specific texture.
