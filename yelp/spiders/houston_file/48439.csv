Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Omg. I absolutely love this place. I have recommended this place to everyone and their mother. If you're vegan or vegetarian, get their breakfast burrito, sub the eggs with tofurizo and be sure to get the green sauce (remove cheese if you're vegan). Having eaten tofu my whole life, I've never had better tofu anywhere else.
