Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Brice and Bre made my brunch experience epic. Everything from service to the overall good vibes this place brings something new to the table among the Houston food scene. Trust me if you like the flare of Newport based restaurants, you'll welcome this with open arms. Phenomenal dinner and brunch menu, will be stopping by soon to enjoy their happy hour and only requesting these two from now on!
