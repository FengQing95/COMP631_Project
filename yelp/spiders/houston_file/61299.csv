Baby Barnaby's////My friend and I stumbled upon Baby Barnaby's after getting fed up with the waaaay too long brunch line at Snooze (we've all been there before). To be quite honest, I wasn't too impressed with the variety on the menu at first. However, the green eggs stood out, and our wonderful server recommended it to us. Such a delicious and perfect plate! The flavors of the cheese, artichoke, and spinach in the eggs were perfect and melt in your mouth good. So satisfying when paired with crispy toast and potatoes after a long morning of waiting. Additionally, their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was wonderful. My only qualm was the size of that tiny cup for the price it was at. However, our amazing server accidentally brought us an extra. Overall, great brunch experience, and I would definitely come again.
