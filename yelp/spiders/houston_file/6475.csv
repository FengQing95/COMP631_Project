JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Parking is the strangest set up Ive seen in a while--they have a fabulous garage that you get to park in for free, BUT--there are ZERO signs telling you were to go to find the place after you park--so we headed for the elevator Â (We were on the second floor)--there was a poster for the restaurant in the elevator, but no signs where to go--its raining as well--so we push the button to go down a floor--nope, doesn't work to go down--ok, out of the elevator and down the stairs, out into the first floor garage--we walk out of the garage and see the sidewalk, no signs and no restaurant--back in the garage and go into another door that is a coffee shop and ask the man behind the counter--told us out the other door and around the corner--yep, in the rain --
