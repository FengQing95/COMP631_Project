Kata Robata////Normally, we like to order the sushi and sashimi here, as well as the miso eggplant, the chawanamushi, and the ramen. The wine list is solid, and the atmosphere is casual. But, for a restaurant of this caliber, one would expect far more attentive and careful service, especially during non-peak hours.
