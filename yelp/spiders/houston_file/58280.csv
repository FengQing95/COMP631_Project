Baby Barnaby's////Went here for brunch with my family since it was highly recommended by Yelp.  We almost missed the place and was surprised by how small the place was.  It really is like a dinner in the middle of a neighborhood.  There are no dedicated parking spots for the place, so we just parked on the side of the road nearby.  We waited in line behind a large group of people before slowy realizing that you have to WRITE your name on a clipboard to secure your spot.  It took some time to seat us since the place designed with larger parties in mind.  They tried to seat us inside in a booth, but that was too small for us.  We were then quickly moved to a table outside that opened up.  There was ample shade but I did have to swat a couple of flies away from my food.  I didn't have any problems with the service here as our waitress was friendly and quick to get us whatever we asked for.  I can't say that the food was memorable because I can't even remember what I had that day.  It is definitely one of the more unique places to eat in houston.  I will have to go back and try what else they have to offer.
