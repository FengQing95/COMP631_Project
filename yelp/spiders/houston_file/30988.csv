The Pit Room////If you're a foodie, or just love BBQ and Tex Mex this place is a must try. The chopped Brisket tacos are incredible, as are the Pulled pork and chicken tacos. Each have different fixings and are served on a handmade tortilla. Two meat pulled pork and Brisket sandwich and house made sauce is perfection and the sides of Cole slaw and Mac n cheese seal the deal.
