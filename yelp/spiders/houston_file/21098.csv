Uchi////The two stand outs for me: jar jar duck and fried milk. We've tried almost half the menu and this review will solely go to my one favorite dessert: fried milk. You might be thinking, ew fried milk? Think again! The whole dish just comes together as a whole with all the different components...my favorite is the corn flakes bits. It's truly so good, I can't describe it. Go taste it for yourself, you won't regret it!! I only knocked it down one star because for the price I'm paying, I hope to remember those dishes I can truly want to eat again, but its really the dessert that made a true stand out.
