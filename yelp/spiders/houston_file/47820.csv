Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had heard about Snooze and its goodness around the time they opened their new location in Montrose, but didn't get around to going because I also heard the wait was atrocious. I finally managed to stop hitting snooze (get it) and make my way over with my boyfriend. We arrived early afternoon to no wait and a casual atmosphere. I found business professionals, college-aged young adults like myself and families alike. The decor was a groovy 60's vibe brought all together by the Cartoon Network playing at the bar. That day I was craving chocolate more than usual and ordered hot chocolate AND chocolate chip pancakes. Death by chocolate is certainly a thing and I went straight to heaven. The hot chocolate was perfect! Rich and creamy with a little spice that will warm one up on a cold day. The chocolate chip pancakes were divine and I rarely say that. Honestly, this might be a hot take on hot cakes, but I'm just going to go ahead and say it was the best pancake I've ever had. 12/10 would go back. P.S. I also went to one of the Denver locations where they originated and not a surprise it was just as good.
