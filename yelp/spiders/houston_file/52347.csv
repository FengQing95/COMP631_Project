Kata Robata////One thing about this place: they know customer service. I revisited after having a not so pleasant first round, and my fellow diner and I were treated like queens. Since I'm not a huge sushi fan, I went with the Chilean Sea Bass. Ohmygod. And joined it with a side of lobster mac and cheese. OHMYGOD. I know it's wrong of me to go to a sushi restaurant and get cooked food, but trust me, it was worth it. Service was beyond fantastic and the 2 managers on duty made sure we were well taken care of. Fantastic dining experience.
