Local Foods////Local foods is the not-so hidden gem of lunch places in Rice Village.  Arrive at the lunch hour and you will be greeted by a large crowd of people who are as eager as you are to try that crunchy chicken sandwhich on a pretzel bun.  I have never been when it is not crowded, but the service is quick, and I have never waited longer than 10 minutes or so.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great, the portions are large, and you don't leave with a hole in your pocket!  I think it is impossible to leave this place in a bad mood or hungry--Local Foods is a must go-to!
