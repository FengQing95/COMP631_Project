Kata Robata////Most of the servers here are attentive and quick. There was one time I felt that I had a new waitress because she was lacking a few things and she was kinda behind because it seemed she had the entire back patio section. Another time, the waitress didn't offer us some hot towels before our meal. But other than that we have had great service.
