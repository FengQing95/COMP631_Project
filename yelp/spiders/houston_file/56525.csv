Kata Robata////My husband and I have come here occasionally. The experience today was beyond my expectations. We reserved. Came 15 minutes early, and we had no problem to have seats. We ordered pretty much the same what we usually get. We even got the same waitress. She is always good. The thing is every dish was so good today. Wagyu beef and foie gras melt in my mouth. Texas kobe beef skewer was so soft and perfectly marinated. Uni sushi and hotate were fresh. The long horn roll and Caribean roll were tasty as well. Lastly, green tea cake was so moist and not too sweet. All food is much better than the last time we went. I am not sure if they changed chef or something. However, this is good. I definitely recommend this place.
