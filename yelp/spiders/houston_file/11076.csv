JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jeff - Thanks for the great review. I'm proud to call you one of our regulars, and I especially appreciate your spreading the word about our establishment. Since moving into our space about three years ago, we feel we have made a lasting impact on the local Midtown dining and drinking scene, mostly thanks to folks like yourself.
