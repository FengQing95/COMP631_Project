Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is one of the best breakfasts I have had EVER. Their menu is full of dishes I'd like to try. I got the breakfast pot pie and it was divine - especially the rosemary sausage gravy. But my husband's dish was even better- he got a Cuban breakfast sandwich and it was by far the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Our waiter was kind and attentive, and the atmosphere is so nice. We will definitely be back!!!
