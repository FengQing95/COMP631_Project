JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Being a server isn't easy and he's the end of the chain. But the overall service including the kitchen seemed very disorganized, which echoes some of the other reviews. It was like being on the set of Hells Kitchen without the profanity. The bartenders saved it from getting 1 star. Everyone gets a second chance, but only after they figure out their service.
