The Pit Room////I'm 62 and have had my share of bbq. I tried these guys today and WOW, it was awesome. Brisket was lean and had a great smoked flavor. I tried the beef ribs, and two kinds of sausage. I ran out of room and didn't get to the turkey. The mac n cheese was well done with good noodles. Charro beans had a good bite for us spice lovers. It a drive from Sugar Land but worth it.
