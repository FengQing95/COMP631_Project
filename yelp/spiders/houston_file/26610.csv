The Pit Room////So I'm the worst Texan because I don't ever want to go grab BBQ for meals. I just don't crave BBQ like other foods. But The Pit Room was so fantastic it left me craving to go back ASAP. Everything on their menu looks so good we had a hard time deciding what to order. SO ended up ordering the Three Meat Dinner of Pulled Pork, Beef Ribs, and Brisket with the two sides of Mac n Cheese and Mustard Potato Salad. I went with the Two Meat Dinner of Brisket and Pulled Pork with two sides of Mac n Cheese and Charro Beans. The brisket was by far the winner for me. It was soooo tender and just melted in your mouth. The pulled pork was also delicious, but the brisket was the winner between the two. SO loved all of his selections, but ranked the beef ribs as #1 for him. Everything was delicious! My only complaint was the mac n cheese was a little too liquidy for me, but that's just preference. I'll definitely be going back soon for the food and to support a few Baylor Bear! Sic 'em!
