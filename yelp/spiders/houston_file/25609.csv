Uchi////Some places love decorating with flowers and micro greens but the food itself is just plane Jane.   I feel Uchi ingredients have purpose, there's subtle hints of flavors for the trained palette.   I also feel there's a good balance and direction with their dishes, where add-ons enhance and do not take over.
