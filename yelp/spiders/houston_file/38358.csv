Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For our entree my wife and I decided to share since we were getting full already from the delicious appetizers. We ordered the Bosscat Burger the Chefs way, Bosscat Fries, and Whiskey Okra. Okay y'all pause with me..........WHUTTTTTT!!!!!  And again y'all ain't tryna heard me cuz I done told ya in the beginning!!!! Lawd help me the Chef done did the thang!!!!  First of all I don't care for Blue Cheese cuz it's so over powering and pungent to me, but the Chef infused Blue Cheese in this burger so that the Blue Cheese actually compliments the flavor profile of this burger. Just a note......order the way the Chef intended when asked how you want your patty cooked. I went for medium but medium rare would have been perfect as he suggested. Since I was sharing with my wife who doesn't like to see to much pink I went for medium......but I kinda like the pink. Yes'n deed ya gotta try his joint. Ask for Terry and Bre and you will be thoroughly entertained throughout your dining experience. Tell them Chuck sent ya!!!
