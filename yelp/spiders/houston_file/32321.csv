Local Foods////I have also had the duck confit sandwich, the crunchy chicken sandwich (which was good, but ps, it's cold sliced chicken which I wasn't expecting), the blue crab sandwich, and various others that were on the menu at various times. I have had most of the sides, but they are hit and miss for me. I don't love the flavors of them all, but I will say they are extremely fresh, healthy, and not overdressed.
