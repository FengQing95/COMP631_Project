The Pit Room////The BBQ at this place is very good, and everything including the side dishes was delicious. I deducted one star only because it didn't blow me out of the water, but it was very tasty. I shared the three meat plate with my friend. We got the brisket, pork sausage (jalape√±o and cheese), and the pork ribs with a side of mac n cheese and charro beans.
