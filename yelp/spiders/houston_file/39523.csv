Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////4. Food - for the appetizers, I recommend their PULLED PORK HUSH PUPPIES. And for the main entree, try their 12 HOUR BEEF SHOET RIBS. Both were tender and juicy. I like their choices of drinks. They have a vast number of choices. Good thing, Jose was able to recommend a drink. Don't remember what I got, but it was good.
