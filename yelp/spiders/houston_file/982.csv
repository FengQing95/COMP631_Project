JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious!!!  It lived up to my expectations of authentic ramen at a reasonable price.  I absolutely loved it and the atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent.  I also tried the Cherry Blossom and the Lychee martini, but they were both a little too sweet for me (and I like sweet drinks normally).  As a recomendation to the restaurant please tone down the sweetness and you will be 100% perfect!  I will definately go back for more!
