Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our food came out fairly quickly, and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes were pretty big for two college-age women, so we ended up taking a lot of the food to go. The cannoli pancake was a bit sweet for me, but I adored the pineapple upside down and blueberry danish ones. Specialty pancakes are one of my weaknesses, and let's just say that Snooze pancakes took my breath away. The Benny we ordered was similarly tasty, but didn't seem as inspired as the rest of the menu. My next time here, I'd like to try one of the meat Benny options to see how it compares.
