Baby Barnaby's////I'm so glad we tried this place. All of the food was outstanding and they serve you plenty. This place is really small so expect to wait for breakfast on the weekends. They have self serve fresh coffee while you wait. Service was fantastic. We ordered the chicken wings with the waffle, green eggs and steak and eggs. All phenomenal. Steak wasn't cooked correctly but we didn't return it. Chicken was fried to perfection and the green eggs were so tasty. This place is definitely worth the wait.
