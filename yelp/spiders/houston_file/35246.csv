Local Foods////My sister and I stopped by here for a healthy lunch while we were in the area. They were rather busy and I was afraid we wouldn't be able to find a table. We went to the counter to order and just after I paid, a table opened up. I knew it was meant to be mine lol. A lady quickly cleaned it off for me and BAM! I claimed it.
