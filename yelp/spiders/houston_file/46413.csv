Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I very much enjoy the cute environment in this cafe/bakery. I absolutely LOVE their croissants, especially the pistachio one. Highly recommend that one as well as the almond one. I've also tried a few of the beautiful cakes/pastries, which were divine. Iced coffee is pretty good, too. Items here are a bit pricey, but I will definitely be going back.
