JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They seemed to be packed but they were able to seat us right away. I ordered the Chiefs special extra hot. The food came out quickly and seemed to be on point. I was surprised on the heat level. Normally I have to add some heat even though I ask for extra hot. However even though they seemed to get it right they charged me for that, which I didn't even know about until I got the bill.
