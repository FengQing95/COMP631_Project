JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Amy - Thank you for your review, but we respectfully disagree. I can assure you there is nothing instant about our ramen; in fact, a lot of time and energy goes into every bowl. But we also understand that we will never be all things to all people, so we still appreciate your patronage nonetheless.
