JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good, but overhyped and overrated. Came to try this place with my friend and cousin as opposed to our usual spot, Tiger Den, because my friend turned vegan and this is the only ramen spot he found that had vegan ramen. We came on a Sunday evening and waited around 30 mins. We were then seated and the waiter got our drink order while we browsed the menu a bit longer. I went for the Sprouting Up, my friend went for the Spicy Creamy Vegan ramen and my cousin went for the Tonkotsu ramen. Ramen looked good upon arrival, took a while but not excessively long. I dove right in. The taste was good, not the best, but good. Service was ok, they forgot to bring my cousins extra order of pork but in the end we were satisfied. I think anyone that has been to Tiger Den would agree with me that it's better than Jinya. Would come back here solely if I was in the area and had a serious ramen craving. Otherwise, i'll pass
