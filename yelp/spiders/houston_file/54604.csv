Kata Robata////Had three rolls, Caribbean , ocean picante, and the longhorn. Loved the long horn roll.  I'm spoiled by other sushi places that serve larger portions at better prices.  Yes service was wonderful and our server was very attentive.  He was very  helpful with Sake recommendations as well. But! I left hungry :-(.
