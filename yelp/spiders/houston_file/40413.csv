Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This review is only for their brunch. I had great things about their brunch so my friends and I finally decided to try it out. Our server was really nice. I ordered a mimosa and couldn't decide on what to eat so my husband suggested the Old Faithful. I was like cool can't go wrong with the traditional plate but I was wrong. I was so disappointed, the worst part of that plate were the hash browns. Those hash browns were nasty, they had zero flavor. Everyone else in my party seemed to enjoy their food. I probably won't be coming back for brunch.
