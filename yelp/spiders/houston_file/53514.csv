Kata Robata////Service was also pretty inept. My friend ordered a vodka soda with salt and a lemon. Kind of an odd order, i know--but not difficult, right? The waitress wrote it down. My friend ended up with a vodka soda with SUGAR and a lime. And the waitress then tried to blame it on the bartender. Really? You can't visually tell the difference between a lemon and a lime? The martinis were pretty "meh" as well.
