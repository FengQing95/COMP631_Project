Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great addition to montrose.....charming altered take on a coffee-cafe.  The original chef-created delectable pastries are salivary.......coffee & tea is good and I see the other diners enjoy what I don't as a vegan.  open, airy....cute staff in cute retro uniforms.  Not sure where it goes after the founding chef departed.
