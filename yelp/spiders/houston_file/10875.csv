JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had a Japanese beer to start things off and then ordered some ramen (JINYA No. 1) with extra spicy pork on the side. I really enjoyed the flavor and found the price quite reasonable! My girlfriend got the Cha Cha Cha garlic ramen and was not super happy with it because the noodles were quite thick - I really enjoyed the thin noodles in mine.
