JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really a great atmosphere to go along with the food. I've been there 4 other times and I've never been disappointed. If I had to say something negative it would be that, their secret spicy level is a joke. It barely was a one. If we want high heat don't be afraid to give it.
