Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancake flight was good, however, the sunburst lemon poppyseed one had WAY TOO MUCH topping to be enjoyable. Â My husband really enjoyed his spicy Bloody Mary and I the strawberry mimosa. Our 3 egg omelette was also good but I was disappointed with no side substitutions (you can only sub a pancake for a $4 upcharge).
