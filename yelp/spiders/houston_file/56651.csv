Kata Robata////This place is AMAZING. It's a must try especially during the lunch, where they have better deals. This place is tapa styled with mostly Japanese food. They sell a few Kobe beef dishes that are really good. The chicken skewers were my favorite because each of them were uniquely flavored, which made it tasty and a fun experience. The ramen was okay. It's filling, but I wouldn't have felt like I missed out if we didn't try it. Also, be sure to ask for their real wasabi. It's $7, but worth it because it tastes so distinctly different and fresher than the usual horseradish wasabi.
