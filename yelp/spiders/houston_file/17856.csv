Uchi////So when the day arrived I was running a lil late and I had called the restaurant to let them know I was late with my hon.  This was his first time going to the place too and he wanted to see how it was going to be.  I had made my reservation at 8 and it was pushed back to 8:15, when we arrived we were early.  So we thought our table would be ready since we did make reservation.  But to say the least our table wasn't ready and we had to wait for 30-45 minute wait.   And the hostess did not check up on their guest.  Long story short we left the place, I was upset. And the only thing we left with is a compliementary $25 off the next time we come.  But my honey was very furious, and never been to a restaurant where customer service was so bad. In which we went to a different restaurant and had a lovely time celebrating our anniversary.
