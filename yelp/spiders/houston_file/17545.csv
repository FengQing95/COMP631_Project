Uchi////I have eaten at Uchi twice, and I think the food is unsurpassed by other Japanese restaurants in Houston.  (But if you're ever in D.C., please try Makoto.)  The food is innovative without sacrificing good flavors.   The first time I went I had the six-course tasting menu.  Last Saturday I had a mix of things, including the my favs the Brussels Sprouts, Walu Walu (try this!) and lime ash dessert.  The staff is unpretentious and friendly, and have made my visits relaxing and enjoyable.  The ambience is . . . I just hope it doesn't turn into one of those see-and-be-seen places where the food begins to take a backseat to the ambience.  So far so good, though.  I hope to be back.
