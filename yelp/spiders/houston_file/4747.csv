JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service is a little hit or miss. We arrived before our group and sat at the bar to get a drink for a full 10 minutes and was never offered anything. We ended up going next door to Piola to have a drink while we waited for the rest of the group since for whatever reason we couldn't get anything there.
