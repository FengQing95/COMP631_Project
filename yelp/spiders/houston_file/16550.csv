JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Check (2/5): I did not come with much expectations because their service is atrocious at every location I have been too. I am not going to blame the waitress for trying to figure out everything for us at the end and she was super helpful, but our waiter royally screwed us and left. I hope our tip went to her and not him. We had a group of 4 and it was impossible for her to split it after the waiter said "I will take care of it." So we decided to get two checks and figure it out and they messed that up as well.
