Uchi////So first know, that I was lucky enough to go with someone who has eaten there many times, to the point that he didn't even look at the menu and proceeded to order a million things. He also wasn't exactly on a budget, so again, I was a very lucky girl! :) There is no way I can recall everything that we ate, but I will do my best to highlight a few of my FAVORITES. First, the hama chili, which is yellowtail, ponzu, thai chili, and tiny oranges. The flavors worked so well together, and it was a really beautiful dish. Pretty spicy, but cooled down with the oranges, very bold flavor. So let's get onto the sushi!
