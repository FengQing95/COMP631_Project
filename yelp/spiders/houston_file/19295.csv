Uchi////Came here finally for the first time last week. My friend and I had been trying to make reservations, but to no avail. I then noticed the website said they are more accomdating to walk-ins, so that's what we decided to do. We went at 730 on a Monday night, and it was packed! We were told the wait would be at least an hour and a half. Long wait, but we had heard good things so figured why not.
