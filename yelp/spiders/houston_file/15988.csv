JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went with a sukiyaki beef ramen.  It was delicious.  There was plenty of beef and flavor in the pot.  You can customize your level of spiciness.  I went with the spiciest version.  Enjoyed all the scallions, noodles that were bursting in the ramen. I also tried the vegan ramen and it had plenty of flavor too but no meat.  I love my beef in the ramen.  We also ordered the spicy ginger and the jinya black tonkotsu.  My fellow yelpies enjoyed their ramen.
