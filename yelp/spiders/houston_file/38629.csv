Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Ok so let's start with the drinks, "The Bosscat" is the way of life; simple and refreshing. I love everything about this place. The decor, cleanliness, and amazing staff keeps me coming back. And, well just maybe, the French fires and Mac & Cheese. Chrisia & Bryce are truly great mixologist. They are so knowledgeable and truly passionate about what they do. Knowing that they love their job and love working for Bosscat Kitchen shows what great of a place this is.
