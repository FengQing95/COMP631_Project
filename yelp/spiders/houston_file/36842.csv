Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was amazing, service was wonderful and Terry was great! Love the music and atmosphere but the manager possibly owner of the place is rude af, they have a nice little area full of whiskey bottles and an area to take pictures while my friends and I were in the middle of taking pictures he came and told us to "Wrap it up".
