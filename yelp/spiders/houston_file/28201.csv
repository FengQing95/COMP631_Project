The Pit Room////Best bbq I've had in years. Creative and simply put perfect.. I a bbq snob and native Texan. I picked the pit room out of convenience as I wanted something on my way out of town.  Parking was good, and staff very friendly helpful.  Place is clean.  The food is exceptional! Not just the meat, everything is first class prepared and most of it has some of its own uniqueness.. like real bbq should!!  Now I always come by when I'm in town.
