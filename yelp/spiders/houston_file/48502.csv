Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////And the brunch was absolutely delicious! We got the pancake flight: pineapple upside down cake, pumpkin, and blueberry- they were so light and fluffy- and just the right size. We also ordered the French toast- a delicious French toast with mascarpone with strawberries- it was so light and fluffy- it was probably my fave dish. The breakfast pot pie was also great- a type of biscuit and gravy but using a puff pastry instead, made it super light and tasty.
