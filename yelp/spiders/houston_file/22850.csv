Uchi////From the first to the last course was straight up divinity on a simple plate. Kaitlin had everything timed to the 'T'. The runners were speedy, precise, and resourceful. My favorite sushi is now the bond makimoni (as seen in the picture provided). No if, ands, or buts about it. Especially with the eggplant and shallots fused into the roll. And I'm not even a fan of eggplant. Miraculous flavors. And don't even get me started on the sauce!
