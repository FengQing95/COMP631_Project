Kata Robata////Kata Robata is a place I would go to relax and enjoy good sushi.  It's a nice restaurant that doesn't have to be a pre-game place before hitting the clubs.  The rolls are fantastic and innovative, the appetizers are great, and the service is good too.  The rodeo and tropical roll are great, along with the Texas Hamachi.
