Local Foods////This is a great place for groups with varied diets. There are vegetarian and gluten free options, plus the staff are happy to make custom orders. I really wasn't in the mood for a carb load tonight, so suggested I have the bread on the side. They also let you make any sandwich into a salad instead!
