JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is a fantastic place for a few number of ramen options. There are a couple appetizers but really, the menu is better geared toward going straight for the main courses. The drink menu has a few house specialties and the bar is stocked to make most basic drinks without many specialty liquors. The waitstaff did not seem to know what options the bar had, they were very friendly and tried to be helpful though.
