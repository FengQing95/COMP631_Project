Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait time was not horrible given that the place was packed on a weekend lunch time. I ordered a vanilla latte and it was okay. For food I ordered their bacon, egg, arugula, tomato sandwich with hashbrown on the side. AMAZING!!! I chose a sunny side egg inside of my sandwich. It came with crispy bacon. The whole sandwich was huge and I was only able to eat half and took the other half to go. The hashbrown was very interesting, not the traditional crispy and flat. I can't wait to go back and try something else on their huge menu.
