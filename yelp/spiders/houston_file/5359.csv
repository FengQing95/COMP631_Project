JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seated at 8:45! I'm thinking we're coming out ahead on this one. Seated at the large shared table in the back half of the restaurant with three other people who just placed their order. Our server came by and we placed our orders at 8:50 - so far so good! Gyoza to begin, followed by a spicy chicken and a spicy tonkotsu ramen - both extra garlic.
