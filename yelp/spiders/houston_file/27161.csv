The Pit Room////Like I said In my previous post.....I wasn't that hungry today so I just wanted to snack on something for lunch.  I bookmarked this joint awhile back and have been wanting to try it. After salivating over the pics taken by our fellow Yelpers who've already sampled the delicacies of this hidden BBQ joint, I decided to give it a try since I happened to be in the area for the day. I was wanting to try the jalapeño cheddar sausage but they were out at the moment. At the suggestion of the staff I tried the Venison black pepper garlic sausage. This sausage is very peppery and delicious!  I dipped the sausage in a small container of their house made BBQ sauce which complimented the spices of the sausage. If this is a prelude to the rest of their smoked offerings I will definitely be back. Service was great ant the staff is super friendly!
