Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Not worth the hype at all. I do not get why this place has such great ratings. I got the chocolate chunk brown sugar cookie and it was cold and hard (yay....). Every time I tried to break off a piece of the cookie, it was so hard and brittle that it ended up just crumbling so I gave up altogether. I also got chocolate macaron and it was flavorless and actually left a very strange after taste in my mouth. The only thing that was semi-tolerable was the tiramisu macaron..which was still overly sweet.
