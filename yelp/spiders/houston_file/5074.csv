JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jenny - Thanks for your review. I am grateful that you decided to give us a try. I'm glad you liked our house and staff, but regret that you didn't find our broth quite adequate. We follow strict recipes from our corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, but we're always open to any and all critique.
