JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Then of course besides the quality of food....there's another important factor to have in order to help create a pleasurable dining experience; decor and ambience of the establishment. I went on a Wednesday night and there was a 15 minute wait( not bad)for a table for two. Due to the way their tables are set up...it seems harder to sit a large group(8+)together and I could only imagine the wait. However...this is a nice place for people to have their date nights at. Â The servers are all very friendly and nice. I can't wait to return to try the other types of ramen and appetizers.
