Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This was until last week when they completely changed the bread they are making. The baguettes I got las week do make a common supermarket baguette to look good. I'd expect the proverbial "Common Bond" quality to return, but until then Houston lost a big attraction.
