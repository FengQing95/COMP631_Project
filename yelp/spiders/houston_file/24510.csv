Uchi////Omg Uchi I haven't been here in years and now I remember how much I've missed you. Did happy hour with a girlfriend and Covid protocols were top notch. We ordered almost the entire HH menu and everything was divine and delicious. Service is beyond amazing which makes Uchi extra special. Hoping to come back soon!
