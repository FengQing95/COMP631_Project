Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a fantastic bakery!!  I go here for the baguette and croissants.  The croissants are super flaky!  They look big but they're not dense.  The almond and chocolate are the best!  However, they sell out by lunch time so come early.  The food is good but the line is ridiculous.  I wish they have a line for people wanting to pick up some pastries and leave.  I would give 5 stars for the food but deducting 1 for the super long wait.
