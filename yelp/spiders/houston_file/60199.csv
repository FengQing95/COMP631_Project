Baby Barnaby's////I can't get enough of the Green Eggs here. Each time I come, I know I should probably try something different, and yet, I still order the Green Eggs every time. What can I do though? Eggs scrambled with cheese, spinach, and artichoke. So creamy and good. And then toast, potatoes, and chicken apple sausage on the side? No way am I ordering anything else. Best part is that the portions are so big that I usually have leftovers (did I mention that it costs less than $10?). So I get to have more of that deliciousness later too. Yum.
