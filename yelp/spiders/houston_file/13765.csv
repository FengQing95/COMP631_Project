JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Houston doesn't ever get cold so when you get 20-30 degree weather you instantly want soup! Our team decided to hit up JINYA Ramen Bar in midtown and this place was easy to find with tons of parking in the back. I was surprised considering the location, walking into the restaurant could be a little confusing since all the exterior storefront look exactly the same. So be mindful you are at the right spot when getting seating Â - don't worry you wouldn't be the first person!
