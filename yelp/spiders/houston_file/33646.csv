Local Foods////I regularly visit this place and will continue to do so. The crispy chicken sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city. The pretzel roll by slow dough is one of the best parts. My go-to salad is the chopped salad. You have to try all the sides before finding your favorite two. They are all pretty good, but it seems everyone's favorite combo are all different. Benjy's mother's chocolate cupcakes and the carrot cupcakes are bigger and better than most of those boutique cupcake shops.
