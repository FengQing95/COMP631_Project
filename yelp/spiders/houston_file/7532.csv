JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I can't judge authenticity because I have limited knowledge of ramen but my taste buds are loving the tonkotsu black and tonkatsu assari. I like that they have spicy sauce at the table so I can pile it on to my liking. I also like adding in the fresh garlic to my ramen. The broth has a great taste, not too salty and very flavorful. The pork gyoza is good as well. I've heard the crispy kale lollipop is great. There are booths and communal tables for seating. It gets pretty crowded around dinner time. Perks include full bar and free parking in the garage behind the restaurant. Wait staff has been polite. I usually end up craving this ramen on cold days.
