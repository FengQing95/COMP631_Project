Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I dare you not to love it. It's impossible.  Pain purdu is the single best breakfast dish on this planet. If you feel otherwise, some serious soul searching is in order.  Yeah there is a line, yeah it is not cheap, yeah there is a ton of hype. But that's bc it is mind blowing.  So just do it.
