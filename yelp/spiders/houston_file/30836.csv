The Pit Room////My friends and I came here two weeks ago on a Sunday evening. The line wasn't as long as it typically is so that was a plus. We finally got to the front counter to order our food. Once ordered, we got our food and sat down outside. As we chowed down, we were impressed with the tenderness of the ribs. The brisket was quite tender as well. Honestly, we all agreed that the hype wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. The flavor didn't meet the mark we were expecting unfortunately. Not sure who seasoned that batch but he flavor was lacking.
