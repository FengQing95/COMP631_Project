Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Do not get their 'thanksgiving turkey' meal!  First, it is listed under 'sandwiches' so I thought it was going to be a yummy turkey sandwich but upon receiving it, it was a couple of slices of dry turkey on top of stuffing that tasted and looked like it was prison food.  It looked and tasted awful!  And it was not a sandwich.  Also, my husband had the bbq pulled pork sandwich.  The bread was great but the pulled pork was just mediocre.
