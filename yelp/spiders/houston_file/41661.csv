Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common bond, FTW ! I love it ! Everything from their coffee , baked goods and food are all to die for !  I love the clean look of the place and when you walk in all their baked goods are on display. I also really like how they have their own parking lot which consists of more than 5 spaces, love that!  The only recommendation I would have is to show up earlier than later. Since everything is baked that day sometimes they run out of stuff ,but no need to fret just try one of their other amazingly good treats !
