Baby Barnaby's////The green eggs were the best thing on the menu I believe and it was soooooooooo good. The apple sliced sausage that came with it were amazing as well. I had a taste of my friend's French toast and it was pretty good (wouldn't come here for that though). Wasn't feelin full because that's not what brunch does to me so I ordered the chicken fried steak as recommended to me by a group of lovely ladies I was sitting next to. The batter was absolutely phenomenal but the steak was a bit too tough and dry to my liking ( would totally order it just for the batter). And to top it all off, I had fresh squeezed orange juice. Amazing place overall, must go
