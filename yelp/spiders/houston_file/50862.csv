Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////the eggs tasted just a little too underdone, but that might be just me (they are poached after all).  but cold food and overly runny eggs do not mate well together.  barbacoa was dry too.  how does barbacoa go dry unless you re-heated it?  maybe they've resorted to using the microwave or something?  it's meat, why tf was it cold?
