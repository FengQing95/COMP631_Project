The Pit Room////The Pit Room is a top notch barbecue joint in downtown Houston. I've just tried the pulled pork, which was amazing (juicy and very flavorful). Their side options are fantastic too - the baked beans were savory and delicious without being overly sweet, and the elote in a cup was fun and well balanced. I also loved their pickle bar, where you could get all sorts of pickled cucumbers, carrots, onions, jalape√±os, and more.
