Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Stopped by Common Bond early in the AM because it came highly recommended by a few friends. We ordered the almond croissant, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and hazelnut chocolate muffin. The standout item was by far the almond croissant. It's hard to find a good almond croissant and this one definitely lived up to my expectations. The chocolate chip walnut cookie was okay, and the muffin was definitely lacking in flavor. It seems like their croissants are what they are known for, so highly recommend those if in the Montrose area!
