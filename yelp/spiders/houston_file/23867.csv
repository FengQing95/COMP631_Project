Uchi////It's true that happy hour menu is whole lot more affordable, but the serving sizes are also like half the normal size...which means that you'll need 4+ dishes to feel like you ate anything at all. Their stuff is good, don't get me wrong, but I don't know if the quality/price tag ratio quite balances out for me.
