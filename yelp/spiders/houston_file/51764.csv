Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loved this place went here with a group of friends really nice scenery from the out to the inside! Outside while waiting they have a cornhole board to get a little game of cornhole in they also have outdoor seating if you want to sit outside and eat. The inside is really spacious with a lot of seating available to be able to get a good breakfast. Really liked how clean it was inside it was very well taken care and the food itself was awesome! Our service was great also walked in with about five other people our server was very prompt and welcoming since we were in town visiting. Certainly a place I will come back try if I get the chance to visit again.
