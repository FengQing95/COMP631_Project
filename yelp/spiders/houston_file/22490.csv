Uchi////My husband and I have lived in Houston 4 years and love eating out and exploring the Houston food scene. After the bajillions of places we have eaten at, Uchi is still our favorite. Every time. We just love, love, love Uchi happy hour. Everything always delicious, wait staff super friendly and knowledgeable, atmosphere fun. $3 Sapporo! We recently celebrated my husband's birthday here and loved it all over again. Can't wait for our next visit!
