Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond Cafe & Bakery is overrated in my opinion!! I expected more since some of the owners started with Bouchon bakery and other noted bakeries which I frequented while working in NYC. If you have experienced French bakeries abroad or in New York and Seattle you would know better. I have had the regular croissant, almond croissant and kouign amann here which all have been dry for my liking. I also tried the Kugelhopf and thought it was nothing special. I wish they at least offered a canel√©! Again this is just my opinion! My rating is based on my experiences at bakeries such as Dominique Ansel Bakery in NYC and others. I do have to say Common Bond is a step up for Houston though.
