Kata Robata////This place is a well oiled machine of customer service excellence and tasty morsels  i have to say- i was wowed all around. The attentive, professional service had me feeling like a celeb and the menu just proved the food backed it up. Had a few sushi rolls, dumplings with shishito peppers  and ramen at the sushi bar - casual and laid back + entertaining and might tasty cuisine. We had a special desert brought out for us on the house- i dont know why, but i do know that they had me at hello. This is what other restaurants should strive to be like. In love!
