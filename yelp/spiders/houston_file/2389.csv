JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen.. Other places have their noodles right (samurai) but their broth is awful, other places excel with the broth, here they nail both flawlessly though I give a slight advantage/edge to the broth. The tonkotsu broth (pork bone) is probably one of the best I've ever had (admittedly never been to Japan) but it rivals the best in San Francisco or NYC that I've had, it's pretty heavy duty and be prepared to drink some water as with any ramen it's got a heavy load of sodium but was never overly salty. It's a pretty heavy broth, so one bowl is going to keep you full for a half day or more, fair warning. I wasn't too impressed with the ground pork, could have been better wasn't all that fresh but the black mushrooms, spinach, bean sprouts, and a dollop of hot sauce made this ramen a real winner.. Noodles were thick slightly chewy and utterly delicious. The special spicy pork tonkotsu is a real winner and simply cannot recommend it enough.
