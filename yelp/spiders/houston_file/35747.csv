Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Can't say enough about this place. Great location, love the decor, the staff is great, love the food menu and drinks are good.  There is a beautiful whiskey room that catches your eye as soon as you enter the house.  I recommend taking a tour of it.  The prices are reasonable for what your getting in return.  As I loved the food which I had I would say that the bourbon barrel breakfast was by far my favorite.  I mean, who doesn't like a an egg fried in duck fat?
