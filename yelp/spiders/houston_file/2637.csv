JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Having just moved to Houston, I have not yet been able to try a lot of the competitive ramen places here. Had a craving today for ramen, and found that this place was not too far away. I was very impressed by Jinya! Went around 1pm on a Tuesday so there was plenty of seating. Luckily, even with the smaller number of customers, service was excellent (some places slack when there aren't many customers). Christina was our waitress, and she brought the ramen out quite quickly! After reading reviews, I went with the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and my bf went with the Tonkotsu White. They were both delicious. The black was definitely richer in flavor because it is only pork broth, and the white was very creamy because it was chicken and pork. If I'm being extremely picky, I would have wished for a slightly nuttier and more al dente noodle texture. While not the best ramen I've *ever* had (#1 definitely Daikokuya in LA), it hit the spot. I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors and make room for a pork bun!
