Uchi////We tried the waiter's choice tasting menu and it was very good.  The fried Brussels sprouts are a must have.  The dishes had both great variety and combinations in food and taste.  The service was excellent with every dish being explained throughout the night.  The attention to detail was equally impressive, we had a pescatarian with us and they would make a single non-seafood serving for her on some of the seafood dishes.  Though she did have some seafood and actually liked it (that alone is worthy of 5 stars).
