Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////However, I was there for dinner and so I tried the Pan Seared Chicken Breast with Parmesan Fries on the side. I really thought it was just any other overpriced restaurant because the dishes seemed simple, but I was ASTOUNDED. Every part of the dish was amazing, from the tiniest components of carrots and potatoes to the chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy, the potatoes so creamy, and the carrots seasoned so well even though they weren't the star. Everything was harmonious and I fell in love.
