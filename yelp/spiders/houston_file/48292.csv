Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love breakfast foods but wait is ridiculous and seems due in part to needing more staff to bus tables faster as there were some open tables while we were waiting. And parking is extremely challenging. Got a seat at bar and bartender was very attentive. Mimosa was pretty watered down. Upside down pineapple pancake was great. Â A single was enough to share. Avocado toast was ok. Bread was not awesome. Will likely go back to sample more pancakes. Other entrees being passed looked appealing too.
