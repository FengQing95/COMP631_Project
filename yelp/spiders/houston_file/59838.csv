Baby Barnaby's////After the wait at Brick & Spoon proved too long, we headed over to Baby Barnaby's for a shorter wait and some delicious brunch. The coffee on the patio was a nice touch, although they kept running out of mugs, coffee, creamer, you name it... Just FYI, it's not free. You will be charged for it once inside.
