Uchi////Knowing myself, I had to get the salmon belly. The salmon was so tender and I didn't even have to bite into it. It felt like it just melted in my mouth. The only discontent I had with it was that it was topped off with ginger. It gave it a bitter taste that I could do without. The wagyu was really tender as well, but I would've preferred more sauce on top because it was a bit dry. Hotate was amazing! I love that it wasn't cold and just the right temp. The foie gras was my utmost favorite. It was like butter and so sweet. It was love at first bite.
