Baby Barnaby's////Of all locations in Houston, Baby Barnaby's is my one of choice.  What makes this one reign supreme in my books?  The service!  Every time we visit we get off the chart, great service from the staff.  I may not be a local, but I could tell those who were because the staff greeted them by name (and confession time: my last trip I went a couple times in the same week and by the end of it, they knew my name too!)
