Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visiting from Orlando,  FL. I've tried Snooze in Denver also and the quality is just as good at this location! So yummy! Don't come super hungry because there is always going to be a minimum wait of at least 30 mins or more. The bar however is a first come first serve basis. We ordered the make it your way 3 egg omelet with 3 toppings. I chose spinach mushroom and ham served with a side of hash browns And hubby ordered a Samwich I am breakfast sandwich also served with a side of hash. Both came out quickly and was very good! I would come back here again if I ever came back to Houston! Great breakfast/ brunch location.  The decor was bright and colorful. They also offer complimentary coffee using bright orange recyclable, reusable cup while you are waiting.
