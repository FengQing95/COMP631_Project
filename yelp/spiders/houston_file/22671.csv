Uchi////I went with baby yellowtail w/ ponzu/thai chili/orange, saba shio (grilled mackerel w/ parsley/preserved lemon), and madai carpaccio (citrus/OO/myoga) - I cannot state enough how thoroughly my tastebuds were pleased. Combinations were inventive, if initially odd sounding - but somehow, things just worked out - and dear Lord -When I die, I want Heaven to look like their fish counter as they do not eff around with freshness. They fly in fish daily from my mothership, aka Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, and source other fishies from around North America/Europe. Â
