Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The water. Sat at the bar and asked for water to go with my choice of bourbon. It tasted like chlorine. Not sure if this is a Houston thing but don't drink tap, especially from here. I told one of the bartenders about how it tastes bad and he just blankly stares at me. And every time I try to chat them up, they gave robotic responses and seemed mentally checked out. It wasn't busy either. Â Fool me thrice...y'all are seriously slacking.
