Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This review is specifically a review of the Art of Hollandaise (aka the Benedicts). I got to try 4 because a friend and I tried the Benny Duo. The most traditional was the Ham version and that was quite good. The more Mexican inspired versions- Chilaquiles and Ranchero- were good, but I wasn't a fan of the soggy tortilla layers. Perhaps it just wasn't what I expected. The Bella Bella really didn't need the balsamic glaze. I ate all of them and enjoyed them, but I cannot say I'll be running back for more. The HASH BROWNS, now that is a different story. If I was reviewing hash browns alone it would be 5 stars for sure!
