Local Foods////Wow this place was delicious! Â I don't remember it being so good but they knocked it out of the park with the posole, crunchy chicken sandwich, and garden sammie. Had a Hispanic coworker try the posole and she said the flavors were spot on. Everyone liked their crunchy chicken sandwich. The garden Sammie was the surprise of the day. It was so flavorful and the bread was perfect. I'm so happy with this vegan item.
