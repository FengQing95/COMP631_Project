Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bathrooms. In a single hour visit a few weeks ago, I was one of seven mothers with infants. Guess what? No changing table is provided, even with plenty of bathroom wall space for one. So, like the other moms before me, I ended up changing my baby's diaper in the entry vestibule on a bench. I highly doubt other customers want to see or smell a baby's diaper as they enter a bakery, but I had no other options because I walked there that day. Given that parking can be blocks away, or customers walk, it's not realistic to expect customers to leave and go change the baby in a car either. They really need to install a changing station, as it seems a prime customer base is moms with babies in tow during the weekdays.
