Kata Robata////This place REALLY IMPRESSED ME!  Granted I got there right before rush hour (around 5pm), but we got our food SO FAST. The restaurant was packed by 5:30 and still there was no delay in our food.  Our server Karen was AWESOME!  She's personable but not fake and overly formal like the servers at 5-stars restaurants; got us what we wanted whenever we needed without interrupting our conversations.
