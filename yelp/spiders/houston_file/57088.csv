Kata Robata////Last Saturday was my first time at Kata Robata and overall, I was impressed. The service was very attentive but not overbearing. And we were seated at a spacious booth along the side of the wall with better lighting than the rest of the dining room. It was loud inside but we were still able to have a conversation.
