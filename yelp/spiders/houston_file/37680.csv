Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love this place. One of the best places I have ever eaten at. Everything was perfect from the menu, to the taste, the venue, atmosphere, to the service. Love the outdoor feel with the open garage walls. It's in a nice neighborhood as well. Was able to watch my Indian Wells tennis on the tv also. Great drink, beer, and scotch selections and all the patrons we asked were very knowledgeable. The food was 10/10 we had Parmesan crusted meatloaf for appetizers which was delicious. Loved the creative dishes available. Had the brick over chicken which I was reluctant to get thinking it couldn't be anything special , boy was I wrong . The chicken was cooked and seasoned so well, some of the best chicken I've ever had, the rice was perfect and spicy with peppers also. Had never had chickpeas but my friend ordered the chickpea burger and was delicious as well. The best was the sweet potato mac, hands down best mac and cheese id ever had. The service was great , greeted warmly, had door opened for us, host was nice let us pick our seating. Workers who were even our severs can to check on us, always refilled our drinks without us asking and cleaned are table anytime we made a mess or finished a plate . Restrooms were nice and clean . Nothing wrong here . My favorite place in Houston To eat. Definitely coming back .
