Local Foods////Cool place in he Village. Asian salad was awesome. Light/airy minimalist decor, i.e., exposed brick and steel framing. Grab a cardboard menu as you walk in the door so you're not standing in line wondering what they offer. Kind of place you order at the counter, then they bring the food to your table. Seems like a nice mix of clientele - West U well educated types and Rice students. Maybe a hint of Â preppy but more in background so tolerable.
