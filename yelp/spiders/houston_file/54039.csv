Kata Robata////The best sushi restaurant I've been to in Houston everything is on point !! Bone marrow , lobster Mac and cheese, foi gras with scallop , amber jack and foi gras I can go on! Excellent service and u have to try everything on the menu wasn't a big fan of the desserts though! Great place for a date of catch up with friends !
