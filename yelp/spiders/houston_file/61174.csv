Baby Barnaby's////So I decided to come takeout I go inside place my order the guy asked if I could go to waiting are and he would bring it out I went out the main door and took a seat under the patio shade with the fans . He came out annoyed and said the waiting area was around the corner in the heat (no shade) mind you it's 1:42 pm they close at 2. I told him can I just sit here since nobody's using the outside patio tables I mean nobody not a soul sitting or waiting on patio remember they close at 2 it's 1:42 he got an attitude and said this is not the waiting area this is where people sit to eat I told him well nobody's here and it's hot outside At least it's shade here he rolled his eyes and says it's hot everywhere.. then he sends the other guy to bring my food out I guess he was bothered and I'm a member of the lgbtq community im just disgusted like why make that such a big deal definitely won't be back
