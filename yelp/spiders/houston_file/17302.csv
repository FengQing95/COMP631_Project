Uchi////The restaurant Â needs to either start taking more reservations or build a bigger space. It is really unfair to not allow that many reservations and then expect people to wait to eat. Yes, staff came by and took a drink order and served tasteless fried rice stuff but it was ridiculous. I finally got a seat at the drink bar and just had to order dinner there - by the time I received my third plate (Which they somehow lost my 1st plate and it came last) I still did not have my table ready. I decided to leave, waiting around longer for my table was not worth it (Two hours had passed, they told me it would only be 1-1.5 to get my table). About the Food- I ordered a sushi roll, which was subpar to many other houston sushi restaurants. I also ordered the hama chilli which was delicious and the bacon tataki - which was probably one of the most enjoyable bites I have ever had. It's a shame that people will walk away with this experience.
