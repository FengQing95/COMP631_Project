Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I haven't tried any of the cooked items, and I don't know if I ever will considering I never leave without a box of pastries. I'm also a fan of their lavender latte and their seasonal pumpkin spice latte. The pumpkin spice latte is less sweet than Starbucks, which I really enjoy more. Coffee and pastries certainly make a good start for any morning!
