Baby Barnaby's////Best breakfast in Houston!! The green eggs are my go to meal, make sure you get the biscuits - they taste like some sort of honey/butter heavenly treat. The eggs are, of course, amazing. Â Also, you have to come here during October/November to get the pumpkin pancakes, they are awesome!
