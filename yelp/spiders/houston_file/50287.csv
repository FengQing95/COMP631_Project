Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our new favorite breakfast/brunch spot! The whole staff was so kind and helpful. They even brought out pancakes with a lit candle for my husbands bday. Our waiters name was "Apple Jackson"  He was great, awesome service. The food was scrumptious. My husband had the breakfast burrito and I had the breakfast pot pie. Wish we had larger stomachs to finish our plates. Even our specialty coffee drinks were the tops.  & the fun mid century modern aesthetic just added a brightness and warmth to the whole experience. Also, we went on a Monday around 9:30/10am and didn't have to wait for a table, we were seated right away. Thank you, Snooze, we will see you again real soon!
