Baby Barnaby's////Liked food (green eggs and pumpkin pancake-as good as one would expect). But bit crowded and loud on Sunday (9-10am). Got lucky to get their parking but lot was almost full. Surprisingly not as diverse of a crowd as we'd hoped. It must've been a subtle thing, but waiter never really paid much attention to us. He seemed to give adequate attention to other white customers however. There was a Hispanic guy who cleaned our table and he was very nice. Anyway it was overall an okay experience.
