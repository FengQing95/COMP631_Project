Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've had weekend brunch and lunch here several times as well and have only been disappointed once when they put way to much mustard on my cubano. The brunch menu changes often here so I don't even know if the items I've tried are still relevant (duck poutine, short rib and grits, oyster rockefeller florentine, quiche lorraine, etc.)
