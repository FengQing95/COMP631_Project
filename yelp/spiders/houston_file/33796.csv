Local Foods////I came for a team lunch with 5 people at 1 pm and we were able to find seating ok. I ordered the quinoa burger with soba noodles and chips. A little disappointed because my burger just fell apart. The binding ingredient must not have been good...so I basically ate my burger with a fork. The soba noodles aren't super wonderful but at good. The potato chips have a great taste but are slightly oily (as expected). Overall, taste was really nice. I just wish my burger stayed together.
