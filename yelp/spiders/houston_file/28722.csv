The Pit Room////I'm definitely a fan of the Pit Room.  The brisket is moist and tender and all of the delicious sides compliment the meats perfectly.  It's a small and cozy place inside, but I was surprised that they were actually connected to the bar next door.  So not only can you order some delicious BBQ, but you can eat it at the bar next door which also has a nice patio deck.  Nothing better than BBQ and drinks!
