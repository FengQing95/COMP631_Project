JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good service. We ordered the crispy shrimp balls that were so salty, they were inedible and our waitress brought us the salmon sashimi that was wayyyyy better. Be warned that you may sit at a communal table and rub shoulders with a stranger; I know some people may have a problem with this. As far as the ramen goes, it wasn't for me. It was good, but I had never had it before and I was primarily motivated by my love for Naruto. The ramen seasoning at the table does improve the ramen considerably.
