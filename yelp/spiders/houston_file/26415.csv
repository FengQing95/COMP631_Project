The Pit Room////Very casual & friendly environment. Tried brisket, sausage, pulled pork & ribs. Liked all but ribs - meat did not slide off the bone. Great smoke flavor throughout & awesome bark on brisket. Sides are solid. Wish they had a full bar, but can go next door for cocktails. I give them a solid A.
