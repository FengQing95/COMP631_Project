Uchi////This review may sound like I'm being overly picky, but when you're at a nice restaurant, I feel like the atmosphere and service is a big part of the dining experience. I left feeling, ehh that was a nice meal, but I'm not really rushing to come back here again. Â However, if the food was exactly the same, and the service was like it was during the Dale era, it would have been enough to earn the 5 stars from me.
