Uchi////As for my second trip, I decided to go with something new and went with the Walu Walu which is Hawaiian for a perfectly cooked piece of smoky escolar, on top of a thin layer of broth with candied orange rinds and other toppings I'm too simple-minded to know. For those who don't know, escolar is actually a type of fish and not to be confused with Pablo Escobar which is not a fish.
