Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is truly an EXCELLENT bakery. The service, food and atmosphere are #1! I've never tried the food, I always come for the dessert. There's not much better in Houston desert wise than this place. Even the simplest of things, their chocolate chip cookie is HEAVEN. The croissants are AMAZING! The macaroons AMAZING! I highly recommend this place!!!
