Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My first time being here and this WILL NOT be my last. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness of EVERY SINGLE worker. The pastry teller, Maya needs a promotion for her birthday.. she deserves it. Tamara, the GM was fabulous and gave us the whole rundown of common bond (cool info.) We met Mr. Jeff toward the end of our visit and he was just as great. It's now time for us to leave and I don't even want to. They might just be my new fave coffee shop! Thanks Common Bond!
