Baby Barnaby's////First of all, I come in, no one greets me so I am thinking "seat yourself"; well, all of a sudden this loud voice comes on from this tall, overworked server, wanna be a friend to everyone, and tells me, mind you with a loud voice (in such a small place); "wait that seat is reserved; I said okay and wondered why he had to yell it out. I proceed to wait and suddenly, he sits me in the same table I went to. When I asked for a box to go he asks me, do you want containers for your salsa and your beans? First of all, a well structured server will bring you a to go box with all the containers and when he or she approaches the table ask the customer, will you be needing the containers? Â You then pack what you want to take. Duh. Anyway, in regards to the food it was good but not any better than other breakfast places. I decided to go to Yelp to check out the reviews and they were are fairly good. The point to this story is: yes, there is a rule that you put your name on a clipboard; okay, so where the clipboard is located to anyone new to the restaurant would not have seen it. My suggestions are as follow. At the front door, put a sign pointing to the clipboard; educate your servers not to yell out at your customers embarrassing them in front of all other customers. Other than that, you have the best fresh orange juice and the best coffee! Next time I come, I'll sign my name on the "unseen" clipboard outside on the patio......
