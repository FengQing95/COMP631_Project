Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If I could only suggest ONE pastry it would be the kouign Â amann (queen amon). The first time I tried it was in SF at BPatisserie and I'd have to say it's comparable : ). I would describe it as condensed croissant with sugar. It's crispy and dense and fluffy all the the same time. Delicious!
