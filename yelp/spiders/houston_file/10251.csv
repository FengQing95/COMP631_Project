JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Simply put, takoyaki is a fried batter ball with octopus pieces. Each order is eight decent-sized takoyaki balls sitting on a bed of three sauces for you to decide the amount and sprinkled with a nice amount of bonito flakes. Unless you are ordering side additions to your ramen, I highly recommend ordering this appetizer because it is delicious! Presented piping hot, each takoyaki ball is a flavorful delight (even without the sauces) with a generous amount of chewy octopus pieces. The added bonus of this appetizer is its beautiful presentation that probably made this awesome appetizer even more delicious!
