Uchi////Uchi is a delightful dining experience. I love the presentation and freshness of the sushi. Â I have never liked Brussel Sprouts, but Uchi has changed my mind. They were so tasteful and crisp. The best surprise was when we got to cook beef on a hot stone, and were served duck in a smoked mason jar. Great food and great fun!!!
