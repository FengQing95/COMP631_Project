JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I wish I didn't have this place on speed dial, but here we are. I probably eat here (or do takeout) at least once a week. I recommend the Brussels sprouts (so good) or the tonkotsu spicy. I usually go for the hottest level and it definitely holds its own. BUT, if you are a total badass, you can always try it diablo style (NOT advertised and NOT for the faint of heart - I'm serious). The restaurant is not very family friendly, but they do offer takeout which is fairly uncommon for ramen places. Out of the 50+ times I've gotten take out, they have never once got my order incorrect.
