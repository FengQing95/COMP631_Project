Kata Robata////Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Houston. The best sashimi for the price. A great atmosphere for a date night. We shared the sashimi platter for 2 and it was amazing. Also, they have great cocktails and sake. The staff was great and service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back. They also have a great happy hour. One of the best in town!
