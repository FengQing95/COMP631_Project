JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Everything that can be said about this place has already been said. What I will add is that the food is dynamic and the service is attentive. The prices could be better, but its Midtown, so the prices match the area. The downside to this place is the small dining area and the parking. If you can deal with those two things, you will enjoy your dining experience.
