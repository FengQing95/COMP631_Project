Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////12 hr beef short rib: (3/5) Midwest beef braised short rib, black pepper sauce, potato gratin: same thing with this. It needed some texture and different flavors. It was just all savory. Even though you receive a good chunk of short rib, my bf struggled to finish it because he didn't enjoy the flavor. It was on a bed of scalloped potatoes and onion (?). ($25)
