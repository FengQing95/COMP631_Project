Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////AMAZING!!!!! The pineapple upside pancake is life changing!!!! Houston needed Snooze. The service was amazing. Today's soft opening benefited brighterbites.Org, it's neat that they help the community. Â Back to the food, I ordered The Snooze Classic & the amazing p.u.d. Pancake mentioned above. The eggs were cooked as ordered and had plenty of hash browns & bacon. I will be back very often.
