Local Foods////As I side I got the tomato basil soup, it had some sort of spice kick to it which was not spicy, necessarily, but just different tasting. Not the sweet type of taste one normally experiences with tomato basil. Needless to say I wasn't feeling this spice, it was just not enjoyable. I had about 5 spoonfuls and gave up on finishing the soup as I just did not care to.
