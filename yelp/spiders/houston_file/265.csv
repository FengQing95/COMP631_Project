JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love ramen so I am probably biased to give higher reviews, but this was a good meal and great atmosphere. They have a decent drink selection and tons of potential ramen combinations. The broth is really good and if you don't like the contents of the ramen that's your fault because they give plenty of options. Definitely a good place to try and the service was really good too.
