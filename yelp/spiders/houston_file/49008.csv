Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- Breakfast Pot Pie: Creamy and delicious! The puff pastry is soft and flaky and goes well with how rich the gravy is. I only got to try a little since someone else at the table ordered it and offered to share, but I would be interested in getting a full sized order of this for myself next time. Â
