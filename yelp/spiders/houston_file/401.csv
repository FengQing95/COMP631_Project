JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Aside from the great ambience, hip crowd, and gorgeous interior decor, our dining experience was absolutely bleak. We came here on a Friday evening, and saw quite a handful of people in the waiting lobby. There were no seats, so everyone was standing around, some even stood outside. The wait wasn't long, though, and we were seated within 15 min. The hostess brought us over to a ginormous table in the center that seems like it could fit 14-18 people. We shared it with 4 other parties, but everyone kept to their own group. The table was also extremely low. My husband is 6ft tall and his knees kept hitting the table top; it's not a very comfortable dining experience despite how neat the place is. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 ramens with extra garlic, and the fruit-pudding dessert. I don't recalled what we ordered specifically, but it doesn't matter because I won't be returning. The whole experience was not at all memorable for me. I honestly think this place is overrated.
