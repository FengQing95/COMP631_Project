Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Seating: You can either sit inside or outside. The day I went we sat half inside and outside but it felt like all of us were outside because they had the doors open. It was kinda like a garage door of some sort. Pretty large and open seating space. They even wrote a sign for my cousin that said happy birthday!
