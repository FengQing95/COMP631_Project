Uchi////Have I ever spent more on sushi at another restaurant than at uchi? No. However, have I ever eaten better sushi than at at uchi? Also no. Even one year after visiting this amazing restaurant, I can remember the tastes and textures so vividly, and the restaurant experience will linger in my mind forever. Not your casual neighborhood sushi place, but just as approachable, your tastebuds will be elevated to new heights. I especially appreciate all the vegetarian options offered as well, and I hope to have the opportunity to revisit the spectacular omokase again and again. Come here with an open mind and an empty stomach.
