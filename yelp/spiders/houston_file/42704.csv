Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We came here on a Saturday afternoon. We were in line by 3pm, and because of their unorganized system of helping people at the counter, we were helped Â at 3:05pm. The lady in front of me wanted to order the brunch and one of the associates says "we close brunch at 3pm". What a dam dread! Then the guy behind me asks "well what time is it?" And one of the manager-looking associates turns towards him and turns away saying "it's like 3:15!"
