JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the vegan ramen here and it is the best Vegan/Veggie Ramen I have ever had. I came down to Houston for a conference, and I have heard wonderful things about JINYA so had to try it. I went with some of my friends too.The service was excellent, our server was kind and found us highly amusing since we all were exhausted and ordered various drinks, some which probably should not have been paired with ramen but he took it in stride. My ramen was excellent, the service was excellent. If you come to Houston JINYA is a MUST.
