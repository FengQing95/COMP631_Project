Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Well worth the wait!!! We figured there must be something good about this place given the 45min wait on a Wednesday morning....and we were right the food here was delicious!! I kept it simple with the classic breakfast and a flight size sweet potato pancake (ummm yum) and my friend had the corn beef breakfast with the flight size pancake of the day, a cornmeal pancake with sausage and cheese, also yum. Both of our meals were excellent!
