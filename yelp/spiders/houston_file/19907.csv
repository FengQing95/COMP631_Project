Uchi////I feel a little bad about giving this place only three stars, but I must.  The sushi was just ok.  First, the selection wasn't very extensive and for some reason, they do not carry toro.  Next, the fish that I had didn't pop.  It wasn't bad, but it was lacking in flavor, both with the milder and stronger fish.  Even the fusion sushi for the most part lacked a lot of flavor.
