Baby Barnaby's////Amazing brunch spot. I love breakfast foods at all times of day and night but that's not the only thing that makes me fall in love with the place. Its a hole in the wall, with cramped up seating which just makes you sit closer to strangers beside you.. But instead of being all weird about it, you strike up a conversation when both parties marvel at how amazing the others dish looks... And the servers know their stuff (oo, another yelper sneaked a pic of the best server, check out the photos) Â So if you are craving something healthy, they shall try to sway you away from the Green eggs and instead sell you on the delicious high protein burrito which was pretty yummy and might I say sooo fresh!
