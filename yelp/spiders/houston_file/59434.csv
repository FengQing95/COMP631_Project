Baby Barnaby's////This is such a lovely gem. The food is really wonderful and fresh. But it's really the owner that makes you fall in love with this place. He is so genuinely welcoming and friendly. You can tell he takes pride in his restaurant. I wish I lived in Houston so I could be a regular here!
