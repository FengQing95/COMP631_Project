Uchi////There was a crowd at 7:15 on a Tuesday night and wait time for a party of two was about an hour. A good option is to make a reservation, a really good option actually if you are on somewhat of a time constraint but if you've got a while, put your name on the list and enjoy the bar, the bartenders were knowledgeable about their wine and saki and make for good conversation.
