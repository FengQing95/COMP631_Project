JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Moriah - Thank you very much for your great review. We appreciate your visiting our restaurant and providing us valuable feedback. I agree that loud music is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this is, unfortunately, one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise.
