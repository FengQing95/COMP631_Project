JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Dear Paige, Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience with our service. Would it be at all possible to glean a little more information from you? Do you remember your server's name or a basic description? I'd like to get to the bottom of this because we do not train (or tolerate) this type of behavior from our servers; moreover, I find it difficult to believe that any of our servers could be described as unfriendly or argumentative. Lastly, can you tell me which dishes you tried that did not match the menu descriptions? Thank you in advance for your time and assistance.
