Uchi////Among Houston's wide variety of sushi bars and restaurants, Uchi stands above the standard fare and provides not only exemplary service but also exquisitely prepared sushi and sashimi selections. While other sushi restaurants pile all you order onto one plate and serve it to you with only a brief explanation that echoes the menu, Uchi serves each menu selection that you choose individually much like courses each with an in-depth description of what is being served. This is one of those almost rare finds where the entire dining experience is no less than five stars from start to finish. I have a great deal of sushi around the US, but none has ever offered as attention to detail that Uchi provides it's patrons. Waitstaff and bartenders were very informative, prompt and elegant which adds to the already sublime dining experience.
