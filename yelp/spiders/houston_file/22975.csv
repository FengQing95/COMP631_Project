Uchi////I found the experience of the restaurant to be very good to great, but definitely not outstanding, as one would expect from the Uchi brand. Perhaps, in expanding to Houston, something was lost in translation. I thought the ambiance was nice and relaxed, but a bit lacking in truly exceptional service. At this price point, you kind of expect that.
