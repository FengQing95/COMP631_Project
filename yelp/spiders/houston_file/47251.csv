Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been a fan of snooze since I found them in Denver,  Went on a weekday so there was no wait.  The staff was very friendly and entertaining as I waited on my friend who was running super late.  The service was efficient, great variety of breakfast foods.  Love the drink menu.  It's definitely a favorite.
