Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is truly a treat-yourself kind of brunch place; the menu is decked out in splurges, from their full selection of cocktails available in the A.M. to items like the donut burger, smores nutella pancakes, and fruity pebbles (we ordered the latter 2). I dont think my waistline could handle visiting more than once a year tbh but it is a good place for a special occasion or if you're feeling indulgent. We started out with the totchos, tater tots covered in cheese, fried egg, and spicy sauce for a nice upgrade on the usual breakfast hashbrowns. The nutella smores pancakes were the most rich, chocolatey breakfast I have ever tasted. Personally, it was way too rich to eat more than a couple bites, and my bf only managed to get down about half of his order, which consisted of three pancakes in about a gallon of chocolate sauce, topped with marshmallows. The fruity pebbles French toast came with four slices of thick bread (maybe brioche?) Topped with some creamy sauce and of course the fruity pebbles and fresh fruit. these were not as overwhelmingly sweet as the other dish. I personally ordered the flap jacked pancakes, which were made with protein powder and had nuts in the batter and came with scrambled egg whites, turkey sausage, and non-sugar (?) maple syrup. I'm sure that isn't health food you should eat every day, but it seemed like a less reckless choice and I felt happily satisfied afterwards without becoming as incapacitated as the people who ate the heavier dishes. Overall, this was a very indulgent experience that I would be likely to save for special occasions, but way too decadent for routine consumption.
