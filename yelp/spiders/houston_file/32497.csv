Local Foods////Recommended to me by a friend, this is my go-to spot for a quick bite! The staff are knowledgeable and accommodating to food allergies and anything I've ordered on the menu so far has been delicious! Absolutely love the seasonal salad with whipped goat cheese and Brussels sprouts. You can also choose your beverage from a variety of sugar cane-sweetened sodas or teas. The ambiance itself is great! You have a choice between indoor and outdoor seating. Love this place and can't wait to go again soon!
