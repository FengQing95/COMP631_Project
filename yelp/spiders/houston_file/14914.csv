JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very good ramen in a pretty authentic and trendy atmosphere. I liked that there were so many flavors of ramen to choose from, with the ability to add extras! We had the Jinya bun which is braised pork on a sweet bun as an appetizer and then Jinya Tonkotsu Black and the spicy chicken ramen. Make sure you add the egg! Good atmosphere for date night, but come hungry, it is very filling! We will be back!
