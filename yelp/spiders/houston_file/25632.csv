Uchi////Food and service was amazing! Probably the best omakase I've had in the states. The staff was very professional and gave us detailed descriptions of each dish that came out. Our server Nick, was awesome he made the night very entertaining and enjoyable. He definitely made our visit at Uchi a 5 star night!
