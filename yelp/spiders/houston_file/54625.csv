Kata Robata////The sushi rolls on the other hand were just so so. Fresh tasting just very bland. The descriptions were exciting but misleading.  Same thing with the martini specialty list. Fluffed description.  The "habanero infused vodka"  tasted like the cheapest vodka they could find and wasnt spicy.
