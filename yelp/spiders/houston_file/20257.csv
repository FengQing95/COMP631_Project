Uchi////We ordered walu walu, machi cure and brussel sprouts, followed up with the desert of fried milk.  The walu walu was good, but not spectacular.  The brussel sprouts were excellent, but I could make those.  The mahi cure? Similar to the Vietnamese nachos I've had at Nobi in Friendswood.  The fried milk dessert could have used some serious sweetening.
