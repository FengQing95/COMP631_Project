Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's channels this low-key, throwback Hawaiian cafe vibe. The inside reminds me of old school 808 with the pretty striped ceiling and old school table tops. A small building with limited seating, you can bet that this place has a killer wait on the weekends. (Seeing as a waitlist is not my strongest point, I'll be there a few minutes before they even open, please and thank you.)
