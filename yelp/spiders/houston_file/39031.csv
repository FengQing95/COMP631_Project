Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is a bit of a strange review in that personally I think the food here isn't great. Ranging from 2-3 stars. Most of the items I feel, such as brunch, are a bit gimmicky. For example fruity pebbles French toast.  Is that really something one would regularly eat here or the Nutella smores pancake?!  I've had their burger here and its oh-k.  The patty is tasty but the bun isn't that soft and eventually breaks up and your fighting to keep it all together, 3 stars.  The pulled pork hush puppies aren't that great.  Pretty much a mushy ball and the pork inside doesn't give that much taste and texture, 2 stars.  I think a lot of the flat bread pizzas are just ok, too.  The flatbread is to hard and thick in texture, again 3 stars.  Bosscat fries are pretty yummy, I think twice fried and would recommend these.  You kind of get the picture with regard to the food.  But, what's lacking in the food, this place makes up for in the cool and casual vibe. Its a great place to come for HH and kick'it with your friends.  Its also good people watching place and when the weather is nice they have the sliding garage doors open.  Bartenders are good and friendly and they make some pretty good cocktails.   Of course Bosscat is more recognized for their extensive choices of whiskey's.  I didn't realize the cost on the Japanese whiskey's.  Anyway, if your looking for a nice place to meet up with a friend or friends for a drink and people watch during HH or evening's this place isn't bad.
