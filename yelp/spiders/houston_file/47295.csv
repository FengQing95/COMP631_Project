Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had a long wait which is usual!! They do have have a long wait with lots of fun things to keep yourself and kids entertained. Once we were in..the waitress took a little long and probably overworked . The food that came after than was delicious to the last bite. We ordered different French toast, chicken pot pie, Mexican omelette and some more. Will be back but will plan better so won't have that long a wait!!!
