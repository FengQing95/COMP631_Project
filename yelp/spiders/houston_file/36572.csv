Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First timer. Came with my 2 girlfriends for a quick drink and some apps. Super cute and upscale environment and decor. Big fan of the layout and impressive whiskey selection (and whiskey room). But the most impressive part of our experience was our waitress, Breanna. Super attentive, very personable and knowledgeable about Bosscat's selection and menu. She made our experience. I will definitely be coming back with more time, and will be requesting her as my server. Excited to see places like this opening up in Houston. Well done.
