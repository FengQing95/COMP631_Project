Kata Robata////Third course was grilled 72 hours Texas Kobe beef and pan-seared U 10 scallops with shrimp shiso mac-and-cheese. There are so many things that seem to be wrong with what I just typed, but...the beef was cooked sous vide and was, as one might expect, falling apart and perfect. It was served with some potato dumplings that were soft inside, crispy outside, and delicious. When my friend started on that dish, she looked up with a look of deep satisfaction and said "You're not going to get any of this one." Of course, she shared, but only after seeing how much I was enjoying my mac-and-cheese. The scallops were uninspired and a lackluster counterpart to a delightful mac-and-cheese that was decadent and redolent with perfectly cooked shrimp.
