Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried to have a nice birthday dinner with friends tonight. Birthday boy asked for shots and the waitress said she'd hook it up and make sure it wasn't anything top shelf. Next thing we know we all get hit with checks A LOT more than any of us were anticipating. Which honestly wouldn't be a problem, I mean it's his birthday so whatever. But THEN SHE LITERALLY MAKES THE COMMENT "if I would have known y'all were so pressed for cash I would not have rang these up". Don't think I've been disrespected like this before ever at a restaurant before. Lost a lot of good business tonight because of the lady with the rainbow pens. She's clearly out trying to make a coin with no regard for transparency to her customers and that's what I find dishonest.
