Local Foods////I think the chicken sandwich is one of those menu items that's so over-hyped (on Yelp) that a lot of people find it underwhelming. I had no expectations and it stood up for me as a solid sandwich. Like others, I did anticipate the chicken would be hot so that's a bit of a surprise, but it's a nuanced sandwich with lots of flavors. I especially like the contrast of the crunch provided by the chips on the sandwich.
