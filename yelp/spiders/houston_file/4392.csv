JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rod - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy our ramen. To help us improve our station, can you tell me which ramen you ordered? We're never going to be all things to all people, but if customers are unhappy with their meals we can only help them if they mention something to their server or the manager-on-duty. Moreover, it's a little unfair to judge our entire operation on one item (based on your review).
