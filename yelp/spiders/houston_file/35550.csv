Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Today was my first time at Bosscat! I must say I had so much fun with my friends but the part that made it even better was Jackie!! She made the whole experience and explained any drink on the menu that I was curious about! I had a lot of questions lol. She also suggested this awesome shot, I don't remember the name but it was the maple whiskey, OJ, and bacon! Thanks again, Jackie for making our visit so much better!!! We will be back to see you!!!
