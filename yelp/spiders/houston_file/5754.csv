JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I think what really irritated me was the closeness in proximity we were to 2 women who sat next to us immediately after we ordered. I felt so bad for the Â waitress. Basically kept complaining about a broth she got that "wasn't the same as the broth before," and didn't realize it was "a science when ordering ramen." My gawd, too bad society frowns upon me being able to tell her to shut up! :) I'm sure the waitress would've appreciated that as well. Lol!
