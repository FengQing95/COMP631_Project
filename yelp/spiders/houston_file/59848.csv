Baby Barnaby's////It was rainy outside and we didn't want to wait in line for the Breakfast Klub which wasn't too far off from this place. My boyfriend and I waited about half an hour before we were seated. This place was small with a few tables inside and a little more out in the patio. But I like this kind of place, it really reminded me of San Francisco (I wanted to ask our waiter since there were tons of posters from SF). I ordered the fruits pancake with apple pecan while my boyfriend had the green eggs. My pancake was really fluffy with apples stuffing. I enjoyed stealing some of the scrambled egg and potatoes off my boyfriend's green eggs plate. The food was soft and easy to eat. The pricing wasn't too bad and each entree had a sufficient amount of food. Overall, great place to grab brunch!
