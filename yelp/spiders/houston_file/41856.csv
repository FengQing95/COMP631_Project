Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We visited friends last January and were surprised one morning with pastries from Common Bond bakery! What a treat, their pastries are out of this world. I love that most of them are BIG. These are perfect for sharing (or savoring all to yourself). When I came back to visit Houston this past April, you know I had to go back to Common Bond. I wish they had a location closer to me, I can't wait to go back!
