Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been here twice for lunch and this place is amazing. Food, service, restrooms...it just can't be beat. I've had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It's only $8 and more than enough food. Salads, sandwiches and beer are delicious. The two servers I've had truly cared about our experience and didn't mind answering questions and bringing extra plates for sharing. Highly recommend.
