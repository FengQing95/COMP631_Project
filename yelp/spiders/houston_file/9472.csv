JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Like all franchise concepts, our primary back-of-house goal is to provide a consistent product for our guests. And as you point out, slight fluctuations can and do sometimes occur, even when each bowl and dish we prepare is done so according to very rigorous specifications. To that end, please know that if you are unhappy with any dish presented to you, just let your server know and we will happily remake it or try to offer something more to your liking.
