The Pit Room////We checked their hours and were sure we'd shown up in time to get some of their much raved about bbq but upon arriving and barely in the door, several voices shouted "We're out! We're done!". Â No one offered us a menu to take with us or even encouraged us to try another time. Sadly, disappointed and not sure if we'll even go back. Not a very good 1st impression I'll say.
