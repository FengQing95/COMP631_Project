Uchi////Absolutely the best sushi restaurant I've ever experienced. They take sushi to the next level adding subtle flavors that make your taste buds go wild! I loved the shaggy dog and another roll whose name slips my mind. On a negative note, the noise level is high and reservations are required! I made a reservation in the morning and didn't get seated until 9:30p (my reservation was at 9p).
