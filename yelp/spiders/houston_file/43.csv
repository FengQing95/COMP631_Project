Local Foods////Great lunch spot! (if you don't mind the 0 parking) The decor was really basic but it works for a place like this, and the menu (while small) offers plenty of delish options but not overwhelming. The food just tasted super fresh and service was incredibly quick. I had the Crunch Chicken sandwich (crunch comes from cucumber and the chips in the sandwich). You get 2 sides with sandwiches and I opted for their homemade chips and the kale. Kale was actually pretty good given that I typically would never order that. Will definitely be back.
