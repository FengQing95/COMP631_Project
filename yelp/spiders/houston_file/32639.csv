Local Foods////Their pretzel bun is amazing.  While only a couple of their sandwiches come with the pretzel bun on the menu, that doesn't stop me from asking for it on any sandwich I order.  My favorite thing to order there is the Gulf Shrimp and Blue Crab sandwich... on, you guessed it, a pretzel bun.  I'm talking about big chunks of crab meat and good sized shrimp!  Their Truffled Egg Salad is also amazing.  Their sides are okay... but I do have to say, I love their homemade chips.
