JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen is my go-to comfort food and since Jinya is much closer to me than Chinatown now, I've gone here quite a few times over the past year. First - the parking is ridiculous. It's connected to a parking garage that is shared between several restaurants and 24 hour fitness. If you're lucky, you can find parking juuuust as someone is about to leave. Their parking garage is also currently under construction....so you're s.o.l if you're coming during the dinner rush.
