JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pricing is very decent for quality ramen -- comparable if not a little cheaper than places in Austin like Michi, Kome, or Ramen Tatsuya. Service is always excellent! I've been here at least 5 times in the past few months and have never waited for a table, even during peak hours; haven't gone in a large group so can't say how they accommodate groups. Parking is ok - there's a garage around the corner from Jinya that always has open spots plus street parking. Be warned though, on weekday dinners the parking garage is very full as there is a 24hour fitness that shares the garage. Turnover is pretty fast as long as you're willing to creep on the gym goers to take their parking spots. If all else fails there's valet on the first floor and street parking in front of the store as well as a few blocks away.
