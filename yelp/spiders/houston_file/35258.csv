Local Foods////Local's one of those places you try every few months if you don't want to drop $12 on lunch. Overall, a pretty solid offering and a great place to get lunch with friends. Service is good, the venue is pretty (the outside patio is great in good weather), and it's just down the street from Rice Village but with its OWN parking lot. What more do you need?
