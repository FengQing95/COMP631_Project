Uchi////Extremely slow service.  Asked the waitress to run wild and bring out whatever she liked for the enveing.  Our table and glasses were empty for the great majority of the night. We kept waiting hoping it would get better, but it never did.  Our mind was blown, in a bad way.  Hoping this place is a flash in the pan because I am sick of hearing about it. Womp womp...
