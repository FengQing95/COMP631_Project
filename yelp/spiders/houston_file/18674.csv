Uchi////now lets go to the food.  i want to start with the disclaimer that i realize we are in the united states.  we do not know how to cook rice here.  period, not even hawaii.  on the world stage, a place like uchi simply does not compete.  i only compare uchi to its peers.  i will pass them on thickness and width, but the fish is being cut too short.  this contaminates the balance of flavor in favor of the hard, dry, very loose rice.
