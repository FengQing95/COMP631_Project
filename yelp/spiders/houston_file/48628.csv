Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Much hyped California joint disappoints in Texas. It's not bad but it's not like the original locations. The service and wait are both negatives plus the food isn't up to par. The 1hr 45 min wait would've fine if they tried to make up with good service. Not once was our water refilled. The cream cheese in the hollandaise sauce was funky and ruined the insipid eggs Benny. The omelette wasn't bad but the hash browns were too salty. Overall just not worth the wait with wonderful options like backstreet, blacksmith and tiny boxwoods around.
