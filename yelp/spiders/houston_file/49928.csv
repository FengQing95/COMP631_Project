Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pancake flight--I was having a pancake of the day, a peach cobbler pancake, and a banana bread French toast. I would say the pancake themselves are the average pancake that we could have got in most brunch places. The banana bread French toast (drunken monkey something) was a good idea, but using banana bread to make the French toast lost the crunch and chewy French toast flavor. In terms of the peach cobbler pancake, the so called cream cheese filling did not stand out at all.
