Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////What can I say? I'm a fan of snooze, and every time I go there I usually have a great experience from the food, to the serving staff. Everyone is very friendly and is always there for suggestions. This time around we tried heir Pumpkin pancake and it was very good! Made me feel very festive! Lol
