JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'd been wanting to try this place for weeks after hearing that they served Vegan Ramen. The entire experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The food was good but their policy of not seating patrons until the entire party is present (even though I only had a party of two) was a slap in the face. At a normal table where I am not taking up additional space, if the other party never showed the policy makes no sense. I am aware of other establishments having similar rules with large parties and find that reasonable. There should be exceptions in the case of a party of two. The manager Keith was nice enough in explaining that they have had incidents where people have sat at tables and their party never showed and they've gotten up and left without ordering a single thing. I'm not completely unsympathetic, but that is the price of running a business. This policy fosters a sense of distrust among customers, you are starting our interaction off thinking that I'm up to no good. I came to eat ramen and had intended to do so whether the person I was meeting stood me up or not. I should also mention that this was during non peak hours when there was plenty of open seating. Management assured me that this was a corporate policy that the owner has chosen to implement. This is bad business. Instead of earning the loyalty of a customer who eats out fairly often, you instead put a sour taste in the mouth of a potential regular. I'm almost certain that the scenario pitched where people are changing their minds and walking out does not happen often enough to implement this annoying blanket policy. The only reason I gave two stars is because the food was actually tasty. In the end the manager did bring out a free dessert, which I couldn't eat but was appreciated by my friend. The other kick in the face is that after all this trouble, they sat us at a huge group table that no one else was yet seated at even though there were a couple empty booths. So not only did I have to wait, but then seated at a table where being a party of one as opposed to two would have made little difference. This was my first and last visit to Jinya.
