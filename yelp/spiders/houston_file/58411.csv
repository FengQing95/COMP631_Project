Baby Barnaby's////This is what you would call a dive. A great dive. The menu is on written on a chalk board and is a great showcase for great Houston resources. We had the apple pecan pancake and it was heavenly. Enough for 2 to share and a side of chicken sausage. I dont know what seasoning they use but didnt know they had a "taste like pork"seasoning. I loved it. Also had the lox and bagels and even the bagels had seasoning on the sliced part . Only open for breakfast and brunch. Got a $40 tix parking and it was still worth it.
