Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had to stew over my response to your poor review. As the owner I take responsibility for everything that happens at any of my restaurants. I also read and respond to every single review either publicly or privately. Just as you have a right to post a poor review without having had an experience inside my restaurant I to have a right to add some levity to a toxic situation that’s happening all around us. The fact that you took great offense to that reaffirms why the sign was there in the first place. I do hope you enjoyed your meal next-door as I too love that restaurant. The sign will remain and I hope you can be lighthearted in the midst of all of this chaos. That’s what we’re trying to do and I will not apologize.
