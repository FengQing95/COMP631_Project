Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visited here for lunch with co-workers yesterday and it's such a cute little place!  It's small on the inside, and it was full so we sat on the patio.  I ordered the ham & cheese sandwich with tomato soup and it was delicious!  I of course had to get some dessert to-go, and decided on two macarons and a carrot cupcake--all of which were fabulous!
