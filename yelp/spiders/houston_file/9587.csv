JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place was was really nice. All my colleagues enjoyed their food. Infant to come back when I have more time to enjoy the ambience. I'll write a new review as well. For me it was ehhh with the food. My gyoza order was friggin amazing. Haven't had any better except the ones I had in Narita. My fried chicken dish looked nice but I could taste the age of the frying oil used. Only for that reason I give 3 stars because it has the potential to be a great dish. Having said that when I get back to Houston I'll come for a redo...
