The Pit Room////I've tried a small portion of their menu, but my recommendations would be their Chicken/Brisket Sandwich. Its delicious flavor that starts with a savory smoke flavor to complement their expertly spiced seasoning. For sides, I would strongly recommend their pinto beans, its spicy and has the right amount of kick to complement any protein you decide to order. I've ordered their macaroni, but I don't remember my opinion on it.
