The Pit Room////The meat is decent. Mediocre. I'm disappointed though because there's all this hype about Texas bbq and it's not as great as I expected it to be. The meat is half dry and half fat. Please don't get the elote/esquites. It's not the normal elotes that everyone's aware of. It's so much more on the tangy/limey side. I probably wouldn't come back here.
