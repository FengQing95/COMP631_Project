JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was great! The food was delicious. The JINYA that I went to is in NASA area. They have two locations in Houston. It's in a strip mall, but once inside, it's a whole different world. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the service could have been A LOT better. Kind of slow and some of our food came out with the appetizers.
