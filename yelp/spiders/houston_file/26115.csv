The Pit Room////I would probably give this a 4.5 star but I can see how it's worth a 5 as well. We took our parents on Saturday to try it out. We all really enjoyed it. The brisket and beef sausage melts in your mouth! The venison sausage was quite tasty as well. All of the sides except for the potato salad were on the extra heat side but it was all still good. I would come back for the delicious meats! The atmosphere is great, good prices and the staff were great as well.
