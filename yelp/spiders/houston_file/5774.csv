JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Is it the very best ramen I've ever had? Probably not. Is it the best in Houston? Probably! What I can tell you is that many of the ramen joints in town serve their ramen kind of lukewarm - and there isn't anything more disgusting than a ramen that is not the right temperature.. really pisses me off. Thankfully, Jinya's ramen was heated to the right temperature. The broth taste was very good.
