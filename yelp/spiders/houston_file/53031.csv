Kata Robata////- The experience this time around was pretty good other than the waiter guy forgetting to order the pork ribs and serving the dessert before the pork ribs came out. We had the usual go to items =Pork Ribs w/ Yuzu Kosho Coleslaw, 72 hour Kobe Skewers, and Oyster Mushrooms from my previous review.
