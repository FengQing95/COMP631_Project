Local Foods////This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT in Houston. I eat here at least once a week.  I love the atmosphere I love the Crunchy Chicken Sandwhich, Chicken Posole Soup, Mintaide, and the Bahn Mi......I will forever be a loyal customer.  I love you Local Foods, thank you for coming into my life and satisfying my hunger needs on a consistent basis.
