The Pit Room////Great authentic Texas bbq smoked in offset wood fired smokers. Sides are great too and have a Mexican food type of infusion. Brisket was excellent, no sauce needed. The smoked Turkey also great, very juicy and tender. Overall very impressed and worth the money. It's nice to sit over in the next door patio bar, which has plenty of TVs. Also, there is street parking if the lot is full.
