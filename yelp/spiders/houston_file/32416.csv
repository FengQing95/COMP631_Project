Local Foods////If you are looking for a sandwich or salad it really doesn't get much better than this. Sandwiches are fun and delicious. Ingredients are fresh. Menu is simple. Service is great. Well designed restaurant. Market Veggie sandwich gets a rare 10/10 in my book. Flavor, texture, and color make this the perfect sandwich. The shrimp and crab is a close second and perfect for a warm Texas afternoon. Awesome.
