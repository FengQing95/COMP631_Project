Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Ate here recently. The atmosphere is worth the visit not to mention their selection of whiskey, bourbon and scotch. The staff was very friendly and on top of the service. I ate the short rib which was tender and full of flavor. Id recommend for a night of friends or a casual business dinner.
