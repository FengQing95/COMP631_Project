Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Next issue. Our waiter was not the world's friendliest person. He checks on us here and there. But when we asked specifically for something like an extra high chair or more coconut milk, you can tell that he was irritated but was trying really hard to not show it. It seems like the only thing he was happy doing was refilling our water.
