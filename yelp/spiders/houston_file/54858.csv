Kata Robata////I had the foie gras and duck breast with cold soba. That was the dish that won me over! I don't know how they did it, but those noodles had to be literally made of wasabi. It was such a pleasant surprise to be attacked by the flavor in the soba, I was truly expecting something bland as soba usually is without the saucing. And duck is duck, foie gras is foie gras - intrinsically delicious. The dish is a great fusion of the top culinary powers of France and Japan! Â I also sampled the Chef's sashimi for two and the fish were great. They were a cut above most fresh sashimi I've tasted, though they weren't the absolute freshest I've had.
