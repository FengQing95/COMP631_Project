Uchi////Best sushi/seafood I've ever had. My boyfriend's father has been going here for years so he knows one of the chefs. Whenever we go, we don't even bother looking at the menu! We literally tell the chef to surprise us and keep the dishes coming until we're full. Although the rolls are super yummy, it feels like a crime indulging in such fresh seafood that's hidden in something else. We usually do sashimi. I have yet to have one thing I have not liked and have been here atleast 8-10 times. I've had every dessert and they are ALL very yummy. I definitely cannot afford this place on a teacher's salary however, for occasions, it's the perfect spot to get treated.
