Local Foods////It's all about the Crispy Chicken. It should be gross--nut paste, chips, chicken, pickles, tomato, ranch--on pretzel? IT IS SO GOOD. Boyfriend and I were SO into this. I can't tell if I loved the sandwich more, the quinoa salad more, or the beet salad more, but I can tell you this--I am sad I am 1400 miles away and this is the place I miss from Houston.
