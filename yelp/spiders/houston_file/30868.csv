The Pit Room////This was our first meal off the plane in Houston. We definitely over ordered for two people but the food was simply delicious. The beef ribs were so well seasoned and juicy that it melted in our mouths. The corn and mac & cheese sides were just the right blend of flavors to balance out the meat. We will definitely go back! This place also convinced my girlfriend that ribs are a beautiful thing
