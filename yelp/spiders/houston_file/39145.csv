Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In search of a quick spot to have drinks and a bite to eat, this place was the closest. It's several hidden restaurants near Bosscat. Valet parking is available but it was plenty street parking so we did that. Upon entrance, it's a very rustic yet modern feel. The place is pretty spacious and open with the bar in the middle of the restaurant. We sat the bar. To drink I started with a drink called 'The Bosslady' (made with whiskey) while my sister ordered something fruity with vodka. To munch I had the okra with sausage pieces and my sister had wings and fries. They generally only sell wings during HH but the bartender checked with the chef and he was able to do some. The wings were tossed in some kind of Dr. Pepper sauce but they were pretty good. The fries you could tell were freshly made and we're also really good. Side note, I asked for a side of hot sauce just for the extra flavoring and that made em twice is better.
