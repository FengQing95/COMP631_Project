The Pit Room////Hands down some of the Best BBQ in the Houston area!  The Fred Flintstone sized Ribs and Jalapeño Sausage are must haves!  Great sides (especially the BBQ/Smoked veggies, my fav is the okra) and house made condiment bar (pickles, jalapeños, etc..) to accompany the delicious meats! The open atmosphere makes every meal seem like a party!
