Kata Robata////Not bad... definitely good sushi for its price. The miso soup, agedashidofu and all thing with liquid came out lukewarm.  I had to send them all back, and they came out heated when they brought them back out. Taste is great, but why are they lukewarm?  Slightly annoying and I had the waiter point it out to the person in the suit that looked like the manager, but he never came over to the table or acknowledge us in anyway. That's fine since they did warm it up, but just strange and unprofessional.
