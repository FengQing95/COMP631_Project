JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I absolutely love this place! Probably the best ramen I've tasted in my life!!!!! The place is a little small so there tends to be a wait on weekends/peak times but the wait is definitely worth it! The portions are good for the price and ramen perfectly cooked!! Inside is dark and cozy and there's group seating in the middle so it's a really cute setting!
