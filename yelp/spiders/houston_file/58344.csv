Baby Barnaby's////I'd say this is one of the best breakfast places in Houston. Portions are excellent. Food is consistently good. And the whole operation just feels like everyone visiting could be your best friend. My favorite is the Green Eggs and Ham. I saw a friend once order it with jalape√±os, and I've ordered it that way ever since. Gives it a little kick.
