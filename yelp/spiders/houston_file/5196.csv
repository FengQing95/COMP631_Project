JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Grace - Thank you for your updated review. We regret that we have fallen out of your favor since you first began visiting us. We agree that our ramen can be considered "Americanized," though as tastes can be very subjective, we have just as many customers who believe our ramen is as close to authentic Japanese ramen as they have tried. Regardless, we appreciate your visits and we hope that we have not lost your patronage. Please let us know if there are any particular aspects that we might be able to adjust to better meet your satisfaction.
