Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered their catfish with risotto and my significant other ordered their BC press which is a pulled pork sandwhich and we both shared a side of mac & cheese. I also ordered their good life cocktail which I really enjoyed. It was refreshing with a vodka base. My sister got their BC sweet tea which had a bourbon base and it was strong. Their catfish was good. Fried perfectly that the crust had a good crunch. The sweet and spicy sauce complemented every bite with the mushroom risotto which was thick and creamy. Every bite was curated so perfectly. Their mac & cheese was okay. I thought it was going to be amazing due to the cheese pull but it was kind of bland. The crusted bread crumbs that was sprinkled on top was not good. It caused the mac and cheese to have a stale taste rather than a good crunch on top.
