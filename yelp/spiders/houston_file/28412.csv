The Pit Room////Their Beef Ribs ($22/1lb) are life changing. My husband and I ordered 2lbs of the wood-smoky gem (Don't judge us.) and it was all so beautiful. I mean... the meat literally fell off the bone, as it should. We also ordered some of their Brisket ($19.50/1lb) and Pork Ribs ($16.50/1lb) to try and share. SO GOOD. Meats were all so juicy and flavorful. My only complaint is that it was slightly too salty for me, but my husband thought it was perfectly seasoned. We also tried their Loaded Frito Pie W/ Pulled Pork ($11.25), Mac n' Cheese and Chicharrones with house hot sauce. Their Mac n' Cheese was pretty good, but the consistency is not as thick as I personally would have liked. And I didn't like the Loaded Frito Pie or Chicharrones so much, since again, they were too salty for my taste. Also, it's so heavy to eat on top of all the meat. Next time, I would stick to just the savory meats.
