JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This would sit some where between 3 to 3.5 stars.  We ordered the cha cha garlic ramen and tonkotsu black.  The garlic ramen was a little bland, but the tonkotsu black was decent.  Overall compared to all the ramen I have been to I would say it is average.  Maybe the best in houston though.
