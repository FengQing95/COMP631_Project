Uchi////I tried coming in on a Friday without a reservation.. Stupid me! I had to wait only an hour since it was just us 2. The bar is first come first serve, and let me tell you.. the people there are vicious. Don't expect to sit there unless you want to shove someone out of the way. Service here is always 10/10 from your actual server to anyone else who brings you food.
