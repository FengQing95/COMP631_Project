Uchi//// The fact that the sushi bar has a small corner where people waiting are right behind you seems like it would suck for those patrons as the sushi bar isn't first come, first serve open seating. I would hate to wait an hour only to be sat where someone is constantly bumping into me. They should just extend the bar area fully.
