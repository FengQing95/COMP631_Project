JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One possible explanation: Did you request your extra toppings to be packed separately? In most cases we try pack extra toppings directly in the to-go container that has the cooked noodles, chashu (or wontons) and requisite toppings. Many times customers mistake the extra amount with the amount of toppings that comes with the item. For example, if you order a Spicy Chicken Ramen with extra spicy bean sprouts, your order will have twice the amount of spicy bean sprouts inside the container.
