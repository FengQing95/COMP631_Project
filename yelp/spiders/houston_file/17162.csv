JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If were like me and  not really sure what to expect at a ramen restaurant just think ramen noodles but fancy. They had some really good appetizers and rice dishes as well...There was a  nice vibe and full-service bar airing the Olympics. If Ramen is what you're craving this is a excellent atmosphere to satisfy that craving.
