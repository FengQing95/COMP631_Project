Uchi////This is by far my boyfriend's and my FAVORITE restaurant in Houston.  We had our first reservation there this past November to celebrate our two year anniversary and we were blown away by the service and the food.  We loved everything about it.  The staff is so welcoming and extremely helpful when deciding on what to order.  We really enjoyed how our plates came out one by one as a beautiful progression and that there was a different person that brought us our next plate and described each one and it's ingredients.  Also, the food is absolutely phenomenal!  This is no exaggeration.   I went to another local sushi restaurant about a week and a half later and it is not the same. I have now been spoiled.
