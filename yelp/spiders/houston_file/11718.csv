JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Why is the owner disagreeing with customers on what ramen should be?  The owner of Agu ramen did the same thing lmao. I've lived in Japan and have sampled ramen shops from Kyushu to Kanto, there is indeed a depth of flavor, or in other words, level of "umami" that is missing in JINYA. For example, Tiger Den can achieve this level but I highly suspect they use excessive "MSG".  Jinya is not at that level yet. Neither is the "acclaimed" Ramen Tatsuya. Whether their soup base is not boiled long enough or whether it's their ingredients, their broth is not "umami" enough. The Tonkotsu black is the closest to achieve this because of the garlic.
