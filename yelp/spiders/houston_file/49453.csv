Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is great, but the wait times are obnoxiously long. I've been here on several Saturday mornings, and it always takes about 30 minutes to be seated, and then another 30+ minutes to get your food. This works out well if you're meeting for brunch since the coffee is free, and you have plenty of time to talk, but if you're hungry NOW, look elsewhere.
