Uchi////As a fan of the location in Austin, I was very excited to hear Uchi was opening a restaurant in Houston. We mostly ordered from the happy hour menu (5-6:30 pm), which had some great deals. I would recommend making a reservation for an earlier slot; there aren't that many tables and they are usually all reserved.
