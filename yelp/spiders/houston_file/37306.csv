Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Simply amazing!!! We came here to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday and it could not have been more perfect. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. The food...OUTSTANDING...the drinks...INSANE!! This place is top notch is all areas, even the bathrooms. Â They have thought of everything. One of the most impressive things to me was the owner. Not only was he making sure everything was running smoothly but he came in the whiskey room to welcome us. On top of that he was serving dishes to tables and at one point I saw him straightening up the bar chairs and picking up. That is a true leader right there and destined for success! It is a must go to in Houston!!! We can't wait to go back!!!!
