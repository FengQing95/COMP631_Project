Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Dining senses were correct--the pancakes were quite delicious but the French toast rather subpar. If my memory serves me correctly, we got a cinnamon pancake, the blueberry-lemon danish, and a sweet potato. The first was tasty and the perfect incarnation of a cinnamon roll manifest in pancake form but also cavity-inducing sweet after the first few bites. I could see myself getting tired of it if I ordered a full portion. The blueberry-lemon was also delicious, still on the sweet side but I think in terms of creativity this is Snooze's better signature option. Lastly, the sweet potato wasn't too sweet at all (perhaps in comparison with the first two I tasted) but had a nice soft texture that paired well with the few pecans scattered on top of it. Overall I'd get this identical flight again if I was in the mood for sweets.
