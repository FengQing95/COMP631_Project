Baby Barnaby's////I'm writing this review because Scott is hands down the best server around. Scott expertly runs the joint and I always know I am in the best hands when he is my server. His warm, friendly demeanor is unmatched. Everyone who walks through the door is greeted by name. When things get busy, Scott is never flustered. Calm, personable and "with-it" Scott manages Baby Barnabys with the expertise of a ship captain.
