Baby Barnaby's////This place is amazing!! My family is from out of town and the reviews live up to the hype! I'm also vegan and our waiter was super accommodating! Even though I didn't tell him directly he understand and asked me if he could substitute the egg for something I could eat! Really wonderful staff and great atmosphere. Definitely will try to come again next time I'm in Texas.. their potatoes are a must.
