Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I don't know how on earth this place had so many good reviews. If it's ambiance and you're just brunching, to be brunching, then I get it. The cocktails were okay. Burger was dry af, I almost wanted to put water on my beef patty to wetten it up. The short ribs was okay, every restaurant in the south has decided to go all in on these short rib entrees, it's getting old fast. Especially when. It isn't cooked right, low and slow please. Shirt rib shouldn't be this dry. It may have been prepared beginning of day and still served later. Anyway, the girls loved it so I'm happy, the guys however just had to drink it up and smile.
