JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////3) Wait times. You also mentioned that it takes "forever to receive your food." May I ask approximately how long you have waited for your food to arrive? This information will prove extremely useful in the event there is something in our assembly-, delivery-, and cook-process that needs fixing. During peak dinner hours (or when the waitlist is at or near an average 45-minute wait for a party of two), the ramen bowls typically take an average of 20-25 minutes from time of ordering to arrival at your table. Factors such as an influx of to-go orders and large parties of 10 or more can affect wait times, as well. During off-peak hours, our wait times for the ramen bowls are considerably shorter at approximately 15-20 minutes. Again, mistakes or "audibles" by customers can create inevitable delays, but our chefs and front of house staff work very hard to keep service on track.
