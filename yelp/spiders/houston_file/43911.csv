Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Got the Chinatown pork belly Philly cheesesteak, loaded with flavor, melted provolone on a perfectly toasted bun (high quality bread), soaked in this sweet pork belly jus. Topped with beautifully cooked butter broccoli rabe with red pepper flakes which ads a touch of spice to round it out. I ate it with a fork and knife (flatware in middle of restaurant, luckily waiter reminded us) lacking the mad skills of guy fieri. Side of sliced pickles & chips.
