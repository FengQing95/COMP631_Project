Local Foods////LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Think fresh, delicious, yet healthy. As a regular, this is definitely one of my all-time favorites in Houston. Â Located in Rice Village, it's a convenient stop after your shopping excursions. AND, it has its own private lot, so you don't have to struggle over parking.
