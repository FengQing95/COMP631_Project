The Pit Room////Today in my quest to showcase the best BBQ the city has to offer I choose The Pit Room of course by now everyone knows that they made Texas Monthly top list of go to BBQ joints and it being my date night with the beautiful Misty Marie i texted her and asked if she wanted to help me do a review on BBQ of course she said yes and date night was set... I met the guys of the Pit Room when working at Savory they came in to buy spice that they used on their BBQ they told us they were opening up and low and behold after a few months in business they made it to Texas Monthly a hug feet seeing they were new... The place looked great and when I pulled up the place was packed and after talking to the owner he told me that its been non stop packed since the article came out which is always a good sign that business is going good. While waiting for my date to show up I looked at the menu and I must say this place has a lot to offer which cant be said for the other place that made the list that limits you and your pocket to choices. We were ready to order and Misty went for the one meat Rib plate that came with 2 sides she had the coleslaw and mac and cheese and of course I went for the 3 meat place Brisket, Ribs, and Chicken with the mustard potato salad and elote being my sides, the plates looked good and we dug in first up for me was the brisket I asked them to give me the flat along with the point the brisket was right on favor wise with just the right amount of smoke the point just needed a little more time but over all the fat was rendered good and Misty agreed, it was so good to have someone I could talk to about BBQ and I'm so glad to have her to try new things with I met her in the car show world and our friendship has grown we make it a point to no matter how busy our schedules are to have one dinner date night once a week that has taken us to some great places in Houston. Up next was the Ribs and although Misty prefers her Ribs sauced I told her to try them dry so she could get the full favor on the smoked meat and if she wanted to she could dip it in the sauce after, to me the ribs were good and the bite was just were they needed to be the rub used could be tasted and the smoke didn't over power it she still told me she rather have her ribs sauced and I told her I like them that way when turning them in for competition. Last was the Chicken and I think we both agreed that it was a bit dry and need more flavor but that's when I pointed out to her this is why you have the sauce on the side to dip it with , she agreed and we both had a good laugh I explained to her how BBQ in Texas is different everywhere you go people use different woods and rubs and Technics to alter taste I told her how BBQ pits play a big role also on how the meat is smoked but no matter where you go that its the Pitmaster that controls the final result and that only comes with years of trial and error. Having her for company was great and it was good to see her smile and i could tell she was enjoying our conversation, we then talked about the sides she said her mac and cheese was really good but she was not to fond of the coleslaw and for me the potato salad was a bit to mustardy and runny but the elote was really good which brought me to another point just cause I dont think something is not good doesn't mean the people sitting next to me feel that way to them it might be the best they ever tried I told her when doing a review you have to do it on its own merit and not to compare to any other place its a lot like KCBS judging I try to give everyone a fare review I take a lot of things in to consideration how long the meat might have been cooked how long its been sitting in a warmer box and so on Over all we both agreed this was a great place to try and we both recommend it to anyone wanting to try some good BBQ Pricing was not bad at all and Misty's 1 meat plate was $11.75 and my 3 meat plate was $17.75.
