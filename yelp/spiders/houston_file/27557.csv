The Pit Room////Would have to say that this spot is by far my favorite spot for bbq. I've been going around to different bbq joints and this place has stood out for me. The sides were all on point and the proteins were all good and moist. I went with a few friends and shared everything we ordered. Was able to get a taste of everything and couldn't find anything to dislike about this place. Wish the seating area was a little bigger but it is what it is. By far some of the best turkey I've had at a bbq joint.
