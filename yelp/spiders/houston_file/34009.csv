It was loaded with tomatoes, onions, and lettuce (so healthy and so fresh) the cream cheese melted well keeping the crunch in place. Now when I bit into this delightful sandwich, this would also be the first pretzel bun I've ever had. The first bite was perfect it had: crunch, sweet, a little tang, and the chicken was oh so moist. If it was good customized, I can only imagine how the original "Crunchy Chicken" taste for others.
