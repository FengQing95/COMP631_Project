The Pit Room////I want to the pit Room the other day with my wife and daughter was greeted well as soon as I walked in the door. As we would have to order the gentleman slicing them he realize my wife was covered being a Muslim and decided to go the extra mile and doing what we call a clean-cut so he came pulled out a new cutting board that was clean no pork cut on it as we do not eat pork new knife new gloves. This showed me the respect they had an experience with dealing with other cultures and the food itself was phenomenal we got the beef ribs and a pound and a half of brisket by far some of the best barbecue beef ribs I've had.
