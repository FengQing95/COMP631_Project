Local Foods////My favorite sandwiches are hands-down the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich and the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich! Caution: sandwiches are also larger than they appear. Eat. Savor every bite. Wonder how you can ever finish the two extra sides that come with it. Bring the leftovers home to eat later when you're yet again dreaming about Local Foods...DREAM ABOUT THE PERFECTLY TOASTED PRETZEL BUN. (Seriously, its the best part of the sandwich)
