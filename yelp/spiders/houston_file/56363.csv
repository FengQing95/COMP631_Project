Kata Robata////No happy hour is complete without a little bit of schmoozing over booze. They have half price cocktails from their regular menu as long as they are $11 and under. We got three orders of hot sake which lasted from the very beginning of our meal up until the very last bite. But the true stars during this happy hour were the Kyuuri Lychee and the Shishito Mojito. Both drinks while delivering a strong punch were adequately delivered to be worthy of a craft cocktail. The flavor was exactly as what you would expect after reading the description from the menu. KR you have a new fan. Until next time!
