JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Black Tonkotsu ramen while my girlfriend had the Sprouting up Ramen. She got spicy and I got the hot level of spice. I have a pretty high spice tolerance, and the 3rd level (Hot) spice was just perfect! It wasn't too spicy where it was not enjoyable, but spicy enough to always have a kick in each spoonful you eat! She and I also loooove Takoyaki (octopus balls) everywhere we go, and this place just nailed it! I really couldn't complain about anything being here, although I wish I had the shrimp balls A LOT of people talked about.
