Local Foods////It's an understatement on how much I love Local Foods. I recommend the Asian Chicken Salad, dressing on the side so it doesn't get too soggy. The fried cauliflower starter is very yummy as well. I really want to try other things, but I cannot steer away from that salad. I have heard that the Garden Sammie is amazing, and my cousin raves about the crunchy chicken sandwich which chips and kale (literally her go to order). Also, pro tip, any sandwich can be prepared as a salad!
