JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Jairo - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you feel our pricing is on the high side. In the food-service industry, pricing is never easy. We are always forced to find balance between paying our expenditures while also achieving a healthy profit for our businesses to grow.
