Kata Robata////I had a piece of a friend's sushi roll (one with asparagus, peppercorn tuna and yellowtail) and I thought it was just ok, but to be fair it's not a roll I would have ordered as my own sushi taste is rather plebian and more Americanized. Â It's probably better quality than my comments would indicate and I'll admit that, it's just not what I prefer.
