Kata Robata////I found this place one day when I was yelping for a place to eat ramen because I was craving for some. And man I was glad to encountered this place! Their spicy soy ramen is hands down, one of the BEST ramen I've ever had. Their escolar and unagi pieces were very good and well presented. I have to give it a 4 stars because the food takes forever to come out even when it isn't even busy..
