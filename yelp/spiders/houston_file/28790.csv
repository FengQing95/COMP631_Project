The Pit Room////I ordered the pork ribs dinner with Mac and cheese and mustard potato salad. It was phenomenal. They hands down have the best and creamiest Mac and cheese I've ever had at a bbq restaurant. Their mustard potato salad was a perfect blend I'm normally scared of tasting too much mustard but that wasn't the case here it was delicious. Their meats are juicy and fall apart beautifully. My sister ordered the brisket so I got to try that as well as my ribs and I was not at all disappointed.
