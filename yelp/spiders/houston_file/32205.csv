Local Foods////Although not a fault of Local Foods, the amazing flavor of my favorite meal combination leaves me fearing trying other foods on the menu, as I believe I can only be disappointed when compared to my favorite sandwich and soup. It's absolutely absurd how great this food is. I will definitely return over and over again. It's also important to mention the beer and wine selection--they're definitely in line with the food, which is saying a lot.
