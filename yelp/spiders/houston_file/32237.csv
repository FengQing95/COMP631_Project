Local Foods////The only reason it is not 5 stars is because I can not eat fried foods so the chips are out of the question for me so as for the rest of the sides (orzo, kale salad, quinoa), I am not crazy about them but for someone who is a vegan or vegetarian, these are perfect. They even offer the sides as a meal!
