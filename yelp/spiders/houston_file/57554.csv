Kata Robata////CONSISTENCY: I've visited Kata Robata on many occasions, and they really have their dishes nailed down - the lobster mac always has the same delicious crumbles and creaminess, the yaki tori is always grilled wekk, the spider roll is always on point, and the chu toro is always perfection.
