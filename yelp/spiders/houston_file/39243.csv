Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambiance is solid. It does get packed and was quite loud. We were seated at a small table (chair on one side, bench on the other) near the back where you are in close quarters with others. This is good if you need ideas for what to order and less so if you don't like hearing other people's conversations.
