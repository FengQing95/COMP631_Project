Local Foods////Great place for a filling sandwich with lots of vegetarian options. My favorite is their egg salad on a pretzel bun with the quinoa and pomegranate seed side. It can be really crowded and hard to find a seat during classic meal times so I would suggest going early or late. The parking lot is shared so it is generally full but there is street parking.
