Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Needed a spot close to the galleria to catch some brunch.   Some friends told me about Boss Cat.   Parking was full in parking lot and street, however they do have a garage and valet.  I did not have reservations so the wait was 45 minutes...but the bar had immediate seating so we chose the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and nice.  The menu had a lot of weird combinations going on, however they had some plain options like shrimp and grits and pancakes.   I was about to order shrimp and grits but thank God the waiter told me it was tomato based!   So we end up getting pancakes, bacon, and tachos.   Pancakes were huge but Luke warm.  Bacon was thick but cold.  Tachos were good..only missing the bacon!  And yes tachos are nachos but with Tator tots and fried eggs.  The pineapple mimosa was good and strong.  Atmosphere was good as well.   I am not too disappointed, but probably won't return.  Well maybe ill try the dinner menu :)
