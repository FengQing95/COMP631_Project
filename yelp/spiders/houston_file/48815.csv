Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On the weekends there is always a long wait so during the summer dress for the heat because there is a tiny waiting area inside. Most end up sitting outside for about an hour. I've waited 1 hour and 15 min once! There is corner hold to keep you entertained :) They also have free coffee by the hostess stand.
