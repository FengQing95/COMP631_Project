Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hands down our favorite bakery and cafe. I have never been disappointed by anything I've had there. The pastries, drinks, and brunch items are all delicious. My favorites so far are the chocolate chip and walnut cookie, torta, sausage breakfast sandwich, and soft scramble. Croissants and the kouign amann are also great. This is one of the few places in Houston that is truly worth the wait when they are busy and a gem.
