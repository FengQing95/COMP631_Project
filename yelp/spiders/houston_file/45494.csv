Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This time around, I would be prepared. A friend wanted to hang out that weekend in honor of my birthday and he asked me if I had any place in mind. It took me a while but I finally decided upon this place. After doing a bit of research, I decided it would be wise to probably go there for breakfast right when they opened. I was planning on devouring their pastries - and maybe the Pain Perdu (aka the French Toast) - and they can't possibly run out if I'm one of the first ones in the door. Plus, I wanted a good parking spot and from what I hear, their lot seemed small.
