JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is a nice restaurant that serves solid ramen and accompaniments at its typical marked-up price, making it a go-to place in Houston to get your ramen fix. It's definitely one of the trendier spots in town, so be sure to go at off-peak hours or be prepared to wait in line. Personally, I wouldn't say its worth more than a 20 minute wait, and I definitely try to go in the 5-6 pm timeframe for dinners. Overall, while JINYA serves a number of things to accompany its noodles, I'd stick to ordering a bowl of ramen for return visits.
