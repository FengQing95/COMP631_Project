Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This was my second time going to snooze and the food never disappoints me! I went this morning with my best friend and we literally left our plates clean lol. We got two drinks with the first one being a mimosa with pineapple juice and the second is the one pictured in this review. The second drink was okay and I did drink it but I don't know if I would get it again in my personal opinion. But I definitely recommend coming here food and service is great!
