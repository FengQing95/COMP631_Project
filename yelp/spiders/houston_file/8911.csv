JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So much, that I would be willing to wait 1+ hours just to spend 20 minutes ordering and eating the tonkatsu black ramen. The broth is perfectly seasoned. The meat, egg, seaweed, noodles - its all just perfectly packed into a decent sized bowl that my friends and I scarfed down in 10 minutes because it was that satisfying.
