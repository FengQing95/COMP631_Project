JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy miso ramen was the best spicy miso I've had so far. The broth wasn't as thick as tatsuya's spicy miso which was what turned me away from that dish. The only thing I felt like it could've had more of was toppings but I was unaware that I could add it to my bowl. Regardless the ramen was still bomb. This dish is also served with a thicker noodle than the other ramen on their menu but it went well with the spicy miso. 10/10
