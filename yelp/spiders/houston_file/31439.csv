Local Foods////Yummy! All the food is great especially as a vegetarian, I am pleased with the options. Both locations remain consistent in the quality and presentation of the food. I enjoy coming here, although it is a bit pricy, but that just confirms how fresh and clean your eating. Eating healthy is not cheap unfortunately. Will be back again! Please build a location in Katy lol.
