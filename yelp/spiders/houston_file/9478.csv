JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth, to me, is the most critical part of a bowl of ramen. It must be rich and savory but not too salty or cloying. This broth was a bit lacking in the Unami department. I just wasn't impressed with the resulting flavor which was not particularly aromatic but still very very heavy. The broth cannot compare to Tiger Den or Ramen Tatsu-Ya. Both of those broths are simultaneously rich but leave you wanting more. I grow tired of this too heavy broth half way through.
