JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jesus - Thank you for your review and feedback. Can you tell me what was wrong with your order? We haven't changed any of our order processes, but since the pandemic, we have had to serve the majority of our ramen via to-go orders. As a result, eating ramen from a disposable container is not ideal, but that is how we must handle business at the moment. However, we did recently re-open our dining room partially in compliance with local laws. Any additional information you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
