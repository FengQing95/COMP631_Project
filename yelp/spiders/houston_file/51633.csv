Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is worth it! I usually split a sweet item and a savory item. I have loved all of their sweet items including the OMG french toast, pineapple pancake, and the sweet potato pancakes. For savory I go for the breakfast burrito but replace the eggs to make it vegan. The hashbrowns inside the burrito is a nice touch. Incredibly filling burrito. Huge portion size.
