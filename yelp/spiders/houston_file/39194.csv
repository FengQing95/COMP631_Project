Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ended up at this groovy little spot after a bike ride with my sister and friends.... It is ducked off on a little side street that I would probably have never turned onto had it not been for the crew ... It turned out to be the best night out I've had since before The Pandemic... From the parking lot you could hear that the music was nice.. and the front doors are decorated from the top to the bottom with flowers "makes for cute pictures" ... We were warmly greeted at the door by Shannon and seated immediately... now even though she wasn't our waitress she allowed me to ask her several questions mainly about the music "lol" and the doughnuts they have on display ...This place was a VIBE... the music and atmosphere was everything... I loved the openness and the restrooms were immaculate! Now, let's talk about the food ... I ordered the Bobcat Burger with saut√©ed Green beans .. the Burger was perfect... a melted cheese blend, bacon, lettuce, tomato.. You know, all the good stuff ... And the green beans were so good I didn't even miss fries... But my sister ordered some fries to go along with her FRIED meatloaf balls... Ya'll... Smh... Just go... Try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed... And make sure to tell Shannon I sent you !
