Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I need to start coming here more often. All the pastries looked delicious. I got a walnut chocolate chip cookie that was heavenly. I ordered the wild mushroom and goat cheese flatbread with a honey crust. It was the right amount and size for me. It was really good.
