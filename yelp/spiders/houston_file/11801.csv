JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place itself used to have really bad signal. I would not be able to get any bars or any internet at all. But recently, they changed something in their restaurant and now I have better signal in there. Also, since this place is located in midtown, the parking tends to be bad. But, there is a parking garage around the corner where you can park for free!
