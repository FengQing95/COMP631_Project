Uchi////Amazing, amazing, amazing! I have been to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin, and this was my first time trying out the Houston location. As expected of Uchi, it did not disappoint! I made a reservation for 2 for my birthday and was promptly seated. The servers were extremely helpful in explaining menu items or dishes as they came out and were extremely attentive. As a birthday gift, we were even given two complimentary dishes! Uchi is one of the rare restaurants where I'd say you can just blindly pick anything from the menu and it'll be delicious no matter what. Overall, awesome atmosphere, service, food, and experience. Of course it'll put a nice dent in your wallet, but hey... treat yourself!
