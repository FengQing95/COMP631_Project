Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This Colorado turned TX hotspot is a breakfast lovers dream. Â Service can get a little clogged sometimes (but only because they have QUITE the following and can be packed during brunch times). I'm a fan of getting the pancake flight for the table to share as an appetizer and then everyone can have a bite of something sweet and save themselves for the savory stuff. I love the benedict choices, they are always inventive and tasty!
