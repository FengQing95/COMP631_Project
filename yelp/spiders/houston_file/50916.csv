Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also sampled the sausage, omelette, and hash browns from another member of my party. They were okay, but when it comes to simple brunch items like those, I'd be pretty disappointed if they were anything less than okay. The line at Snooze, I suppose, is because there's nowhere else to go for brunch aside from IHOP or Denny's. While this place is in fact better than both of those, I'd say it wasn't by a huge margin, or one large enough to justify a long wait or hefty price tag. 3 stars.
