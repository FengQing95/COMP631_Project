Baby Barnaby's////Terrific food, fun decor, and amazing and attentive people! Â In Houston for work and after a week of blah breakfast at my hotel I really wanted some good eats. I discovered this gem on Google Maps. The only negative is the lack of parking. The fresh squeezed-right-in-front-of-you orange juice, the huge portions, and the kitschy decor more atom made up for that though. I will be back when I'm in town and I can't wait to explore the menu further!
