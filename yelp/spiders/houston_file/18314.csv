Uchi////I went there tonight with my friend and was served by Patrick and I think a Pam or Kim... 45 minute wait as a walk-in so it wasn't a big deal whatsoever. Just had coffee next door and boom, seated at the sushi bar which was a cool experience. The restaurant was slammed and they gave complimentary artichoke hearts which was very nice of them. Golden Tile was good, torched Wagyu was delicious and succulent, fried Milk was amazing, and wine selection was great. Now I see all the hype of this Houston/Montrose place. Best sushi place that's not on the West Coast in my honest opinion.
