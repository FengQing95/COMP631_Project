JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sarah - Thank you for your review. Would you be so kind as to tell me which ramen(s) you have tried, and how specifically they tasted different to you after a second sampling? The key components for all of our ramens are measured to the exact gram, per instructions given to us by JINYA corporate headquarters, which we have been following religiously these past 15 months. Also, at both of our locations, there is only one person in charge of producing our various broths. Their singular job is consistency. However, ramen toppings such as green onions, kikurage and bean sprouts are added by hand by the ramen chefs, which might render some minor fluctuations from soup to soup. Thank you again for your review, and any additional information you can provide will help us immensely.
