JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ambiance is great. Parking is good. Crowd gets pretty thick so there may be a wait. The food is exceptional. My only criticism is the level of service. They are super nice but the service is on the slow side. So I normally ask for the check mid way through the ramen.
