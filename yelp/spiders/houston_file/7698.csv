JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Josh - Thank you for your review. In the 5-1/2 years that our restaurant has been open, we have never received a review like this. We are genuinely surprised by your reporting since we have an excellent busser team that attends to our restrooms every half hour. Furthermore, just like any other restaurant in the city, our house gets routine inspections from the City of Houston Health Department, and we receive high marks.
