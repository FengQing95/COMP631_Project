Local Foods////Given all this positive feedback, why not five stars, you ask?  Well, the last time I was there, I got the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich, and they forgot to put the greens and tomato on it.  Probably just a mental lapse, but it calls into question to care and thoughtfulness I've always taken for granted.  Regardless, I'll definitely be back--this is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston.
