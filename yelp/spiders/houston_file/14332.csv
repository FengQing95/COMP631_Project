JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't eat spicy, but the classic ramen didn't disappoint. Great flavor, texture, and variation. Not enough noodles, so it was a pain to bring the broth back home and make some noodles for myself the next day. DO NOT buy the refill noodles. It's a sad amount and you're better off making your own.
