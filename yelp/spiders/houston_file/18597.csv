Uchi////We had a table for Saturday at 8:30 PM. The place was packed to the gills. The hostess was very friendly although she seemed a bit stressed out. We found a spot to stand around and do some people watching while waiting for our table. We had to wait about 30-40 minutes before we were seated. There were a couple of complimentary appetizers being passed around to hungry patrons due to the long waits. We managed to sample the onion rings which were pretty light and tasty.
