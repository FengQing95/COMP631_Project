Baby Barnaby's////The potatoes were very good.  The pancake was solid and the chicken apple sausage was pretty good.  I went for the french toast I've heard rave about but they haven't had that in inventory for a while and will be out of stock indefinitely, apparently.  All in all it was pretty good with good service, so I'd return and recommend.
