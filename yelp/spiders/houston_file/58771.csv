Baby Barnaby's////I ate at Baby Barnaby's about 2 months ago. I cannot stop thinking about the biscuits. They came out super late because they were baking new ones. I would have waited 5 hours for those biscuits. They were to die for! And the green eggs was definitely one of the best breakfast egg dishes I've ever had. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Houston.
