Uchi////Celebrated my birthday here, the food was delicious, everything we ordered tasted so fresh over all very good food. The service was good, the servers were knowledgeable about their menu and I appreciated their suggestions since it was my first visit. Definately coming back for another round of sushi soon. Thank you Uchi team!
