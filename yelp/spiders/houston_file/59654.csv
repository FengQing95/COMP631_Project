Baby Barnaby's////There are so many great brunch places in Houston, but this is probably my favorite.  It reminds me of Magnolia Cafe in Austin, but better service and even better food.  Green eggs??  Yes!  It is so creamy and cheesey and delicious.  And it's green so I can convince myself it's healthy.  I stick with the veggie sausage which is probably just the standard frozen kind you can get at the grocery store, but I love it.  The potatoes are cooked perfectly, flavored well, and just the right size.  I always leave feeling super stuffed because I don't want to waste any of my food on the plate.
