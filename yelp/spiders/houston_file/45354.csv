Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose//// Pistachio croissant is also something new), to fancier desserts, like eclairs, parfaits, cakes, even macarons.  They also have savory menu items such as sandwiches, burgers, and salads.  I have yet to have something there I did not like, they even offer a lavendar latte and kombucha.  Be prepared to fight for parking, but do not let that deter you.  Once inside, the glass room and high ceilings make it a perfect place to catch up with friends while devouring a pastry and a hot cup of coffee.
