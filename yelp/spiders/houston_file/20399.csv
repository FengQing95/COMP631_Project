Uchi////I had a chance to visit Uchi for my birthday and it was phenomenal. Honestly when looking at reviews and information on yelps, i was a little nervous. The menu seems like not my cup of tea. But it's worth trying so i went there with my boyfriend and my sister for my birthday. Everything was amazing since we stepped in. They started with warm towels to clean our hands due to some of the food would be better eaten my hands. We ordered some rolls, quails and duck curry. All were amazing. we got the fried milk for dessert and Uchi gave us one more dessert for my birthday. It was the peanut butter something. They were both great. They also give discount for first time visit customers. Great service. Worth coming back even though the wait is pretty long for weekends with no reservations.
