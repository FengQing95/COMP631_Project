The Pit Room////It's been a long time since I've had beef ribs so I decided to check out The Pit. I didn't look at the prices because it was lunchtime and I on the edge of "hangry". I ordered two beef ribs and a side of potato salad with water. Cost: $44. Holy cow. That's expensive.  The meat was tender but highly seasoned with some pepper crust.  I didn't realize just how strong until I woke up that night with heartburn. It was intense and I like spicy food.
