Uchi////A totally new experience light years ahead of your typical Houston sushi restaurant. If you're used to the traditional nigiri and sashimi sushi restaurants like me, Uchi may take a bit of getting used to. The word "balance" comes to mind a lot during each bite, and from the words of the chef himself, "we try to balance and compliment the flavors to excite your taste buds." All of their popular appetizers and even sushi are very well balanced between savory fish with the ultimate degree of freshness, paired with bits and hints of citrus, sweet and/or sour notes. My friend, a fellow foodie, described it perfectly when she said "I want my palette to be constantly challenged." For anyone who's looking to go for the first time, skip the traditional nigiri. Go for what they're known for, creative and flavorful concoctions that you cannot experience anywhere else in Houston. Needless to say, the food is excellent.
