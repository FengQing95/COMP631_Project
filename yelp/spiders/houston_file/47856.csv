Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Don't snooze on this eatery! Get there early to beat the crowd and to get a nice window seat! This place specializes in organic, vegan and free range foods that have no additives! We ordered pineapple upside down pancakes, pecan pancakes, a big huge burrito and poached egg meal! These were all great as well as the spicy condiments that you can ask for. Don't forget to tell them that I sent you and order one of those fabulous mimosas.
