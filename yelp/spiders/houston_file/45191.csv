Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We went on a weekend so there were some extra selections in their bakery, but it was also very packed and there was a line out the door, so if you want to go for brunch, I would suggest going a little early or just go on a week day. Since it was crowded there wasn't much parking either, so bring your walking shoes because you might have to walk a bit.
