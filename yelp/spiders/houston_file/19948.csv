Uchi////We love this place!  The entire experience is fantastic.  The social hour is a great value to allow you to try different rolls at a discounted price.  If you can sit at the sushi bar to experience their craft.  The daily specials are amazing, try the duck noba and the quail dishes both are delicious.
