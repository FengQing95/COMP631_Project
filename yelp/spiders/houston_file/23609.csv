Uchi////The fried roll I tried was not heavy and also not what I was expecting .Definitely thought it was like shrimp tempura, avocado, and salmon but it ended up just being a fried roll of that. As for the foie gras, the taste was AMAZING but the texture is just a little too much for me with not enough rice. If I had it with a small serving of rice, I think I would have been able to handle it better. Overall, I really enjoyed my first and probably very few experiences here due to the price!
