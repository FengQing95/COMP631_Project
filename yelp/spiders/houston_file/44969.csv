Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2. My only real complaint is with the long line, which seems to be an obligatory Â part of the Common Bond experience. I am hear to console those of you who have just started waiting in a line that starts out the door that the length of the line seems to have nothing to do with the availability of seats inside, but rather the architecture of the ordering process, which has too few service personnel for the number of customers. The management may want to take a look at this, since long lines rarely enhance an enterprise's brand.
