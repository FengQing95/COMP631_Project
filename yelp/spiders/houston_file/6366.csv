JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For ramen, they have a selection of chicken, pork, or vegetarian ramen and can come with either thick or thin noodles. The extra toppings were a little on the pricey side (like 50 cents for butter? Am I going to get a stick of butter for that price? Who knows maybe.. I didn't get it). But hey, the fresh garlic is free!!
