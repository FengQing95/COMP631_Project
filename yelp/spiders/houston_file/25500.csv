Uchi////Since it was our first time, we ordered the omakase, which was around $125/person. I ordered the kara kyuri cocktail, which tasted like fresh, citrusy cucumber water with a spicy kick. Since the dishes were chef's choice, I don't know the exact name of the dishes but every thing tasted amazing! As for dessert, we received the jasmine cream and coconut tapioca. We also ordered the fried milk and we liked this better than the desserts that were offered on the omakase.
