Local Foods////I've always heard great things about this place but avoided it because of the parking (it's a total pain being in the the Rice Village and sharing the same lot as Benjy's and Kelvin & Arms). Anyhow, to my surprise, it's actually a pretty cool casual sandwich (and salad) shop. It's a walkin, grab a clipboard, and stand in line kind of place. Prices are pretty reasonable too.
