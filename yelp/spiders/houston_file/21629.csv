Uchi////My boyfriend and I came here for an early Valentine's Day dinner, and what a unique dining experience. We had a reservation for 5, when they opened, so we were seated promptly. There was a Talking Heads song playing overhead. We were a bit overwhelmed by the selection, so we had our waiter (Kyle) choose our dishes for us. He did a great job. They serve everything tapas style, one small dish after the other. You never know which direction it'll be coming from, or who will be bringing it, which was kind of exciting. The Fried Yuca, Brussel Sprouts, and Kabocha (pumpkin) tempura were all exceptional, and all of the sushi was delicious. The only dish I remember really not liking was the Duck Salad. The Fried Milk dessert was so interesting. So many different shapes and textures. For someone on my budget, this is a special occasion place only, but I would definitely come again.
