Baby Barnaby's////Plain and simple - Baby Barnaby's is my favorite place to brunch! The french toast is fabulous as is their migas. The service is usually excellent but expect to wait especially on weekends. Props to their management for developing such a good system of managing guests and wait times. On busy days, you sign in when you arrive and can help yourself to unlimited coffee outside. When your table is ready a server will call your name off the list.
