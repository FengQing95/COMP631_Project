JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Aubrie - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad Kevin provided you great, friendly service. I have passed your kind words onto him. And I have also passed the note onto our chefs to do a better job stirring up the noodles as soon as they are dropped into the hot broth. This helps separate the noodles that continue to cook once they are pulled from boiling water.
