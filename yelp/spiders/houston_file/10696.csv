JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The cha cha cha , we were both expecting to be packed with garlic flavor , it had garlic oil , fried garlic and the broth was made with garlic cloves . With it being called the garlic lovers ramen we were disappointed when we tried it. The broth lacked a depth of flavor I expect when I eat ramen it was very reminiscent of phö broth which is amazing when I want phö . It was light in flavor and not as rich and creamy as our favorite ramen place here in Houston . But back to it being all about the garlic , with as much of it that was said to be packed into the bowl it was barely distinguishable from the tinkotsu Black that I had which didn't boast its massive amount of garlic . And had more of the garlic punch we were looking for .
