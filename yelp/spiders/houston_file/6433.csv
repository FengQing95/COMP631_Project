JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good ramen. Nothing to complain. I think the noodles can have more variety options. I like sitting at the bar. However, the table seat is space is a bit crowded. You will be sitting really close to people. It's hard to hang out with a friend there and talk. It's more like you eat then leave. But that's part of the style of the place. So it's just my personal point of view. Always have good experience there.
