Kata Robata////I ordered a longhorn roll to go, and my surprised when I got home was, there were 6 tiny tiny ugly looking pieces of sushi with a gas station-like packing. Paid 15$+. That is not important if the sushi tastes like heaven but this one definitely didn't have anything special. HEB sushi tastes better. I am a big sushi eater and have tried several places everywhere I go. Super disappointed. Not recommended, not coming back.
