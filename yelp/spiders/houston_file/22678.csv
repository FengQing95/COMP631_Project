Uchi////I really really really wanted to like this place. First of all, all the reviews made me want to go so bad and when I finally got around to making a reservation I could only get one for 930 which was fine really but I wonder if the time didn't have anything to do with why I didn't like it as much. We got here a few minutes before 930 and we were promptly seated (there were so many empty seats that I wish we had gotten here much earlier and just taken a gamble on being seated much earlier). Anyway, the waiter explained the menu and we ordered.
