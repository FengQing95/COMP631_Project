JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend loves this place but then again he only eats the same thing every single time. I have decided to try something new and so far nothing has stood out to me but the cauliflower appetizer and the sprout me up ramen. Overall I don't think this is the best ramen and definitely do not get the Tokyo curry. I'm not one to return my food but that dish was nothing but white plain rice and this brown sauce. Maybe if there was actual chicken I would of forced it down my throat but there was nothing but Alpo.
