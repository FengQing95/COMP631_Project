Local Foods////I went to this little restaurant in rice village next to Benjy's for lunch with some friends on a work day and really liked it.  The entire menu has fresh food with a lot of healthy options with some interesting salads.  I tried the vegetable bisque and shrimp and crab sandwich which was probably not very healthy but certainly very good.  My friends really liked their salads as well.
