JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Tokyo Yatai Ramen and the husband got the Tonkotsu Assari. The broth for both were mediocre; they were more salty than flavorful. The noodles were al dente and the char siu was tasty though. Â I think I'll pass on returning, I can get better noodles and soup cheaper in Bellaire.
