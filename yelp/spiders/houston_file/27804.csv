The Pit Room////I gave the restaurant a five star rating because it truly is five stars. The only places that get perfect 10s are places like Killen's in Pearland and Franklin in Austin. I'd go as far to put The Pit Room up with BBQ establishments you'd find in Lockhart (if you haven't been, each of the three main spots have their own specialties).
