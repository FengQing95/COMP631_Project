Uchi////I came here with my family for my birthday. Although my reservation was at 7:45, we were seated a little later which is understandable since it's incredibly packed. The food was just as good as the raves. Some of the best sake toro and scallop I have had. The hot rock was also delicious. I definitely recommend the foie gras. I did not really like the famous kaarage chicken. House sake is recommended. Top it off with the fried milk dessert. My server was really nice, accommodating, and the food came out in a nice order. It's a must try.
