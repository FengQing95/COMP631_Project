JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sara - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. We do separate our broth from noodles for the very reason you describe. Also, if you heat up the broth separately, it recreates the ramen meal much better than heating everything simultaneously. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you in the future.
