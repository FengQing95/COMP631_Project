JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of my favorite ramen places to go to now! I have been here a couple times already and I must say my personal favorite is still the tonkatsu black. Of course I add a bunch of other sides to it like corn, bean sprouts, etc. one thing I do recommend is try adding fresh garlic to it. It already comes with Garlic oil, but the fresh garlic just adds that extra kick that makes it even more savory.
