JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Karyn - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us. I have been in the restaurant industry for nearly 25 years, and I can honestly say there is absolutely no perfect method for seating guests, regardless of party size. Every scenario should be handled on a case-by-case basis, though we have instructed our hosts to adhere to a very firm policy on not seating incomplete parties.
