Kata Robata////Wonderful experience! We had a party of seven and wondered numerous things off the menu. Everything was delicious, but my two favorites were the Kobe beef skewers (omg! They melt in your mouth I'm going to dream about them) and the tropical spicy tuna roll. The service was also impressive attentive and fast! Loved it!
