Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat had a wide variety of thing on the menu. We started off with the pork Belly Poutine, the bar tender recommended we add egg which was a nice suggestion. The app was pretty good, could have had more pork belly , but the fries, cheese curds, and sauce were excellent.
