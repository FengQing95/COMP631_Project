Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This business is professional and handles customers well. My country fried steak took a long time to come out and before I could even say anything the waiters kept checking on my table . While checking in on the table they were apologetic about the food taking so long . When it finally came out I tasted the dish and it wasn't what I thought it would be as far as flavor of the gumbo sauce etc. he told me I could get something else so I ordered the fruity pebble French toast . It came out quickly and the managers began taking care of the table and gave us a carafe for waiting due to all the other tables after us eating by then. Great customer service . Food was great , loved the French toast ! Didn't need any syrup or anything , the location was amazing with valet parking !
