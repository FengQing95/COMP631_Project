Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Such a cute little spot for a sit down meal or a quick bite! I ordered a truffle mushroom flatbread, the Nashville spicy chicken sandwich, an early grey & sesame tart, and a chocolate chip walnut cookie. Nothing disappointed! The fried chicken was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor. The flatbread was delicious, as well. The tart was really yummy and the flavors went together so well! I took the cookie home so I could warm it up and eat it with milk- I HIGHLY recommend. The cookie is good room temp, but I always think desserts are better served warm and with a cold glass of milk.
