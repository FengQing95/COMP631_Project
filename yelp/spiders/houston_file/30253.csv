The Pit Room////Anyways we got to sit out on the patio area it was a little hot that day but a decent day regardless. So the brisket was tender and delicious, but I do think I might need more flavoring or more seasoning. Now the ribs are phenomenal they had the right amount of seasoning and smoke. I love the ribs and I don't even like pork as much as beef but they were great! The sausage which I think they make inhouse was great too! But to have that sauce to do into anything is a great addition!
