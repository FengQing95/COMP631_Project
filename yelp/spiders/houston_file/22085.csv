Uchi////I go back and forth on whether this is a 4 or 5 star. This place is really a 4.5 in my book. I've been here many times and consistently have had a GOOD meal. It has not consistently been AMAZING. I've ordered omasake twice here, and both times have left still pretty hungry. The sushi and sashimi are phenomenal, well flavored, and innovative. I wish that their portion sizes were a little bigger.
