Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Anytime we visit Houston this is exactly where we stop by for brunch. Their mimosas are kind of pricey, but the best mimosas I've ever had so totally worth it. Have tried a number of different eggs Benedicts with different toppings and they're are all exquisite. What I really love about this place is that they are also always willing to work with you. If you want a half order of something or even mix and match two different types of dish they will do it for you! Love Snooze!
