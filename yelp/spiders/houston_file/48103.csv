Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Houston your pallets has gone to the dogs.  What a great disappointment.  This restaurant belongs in the woodlands, not Montrose. Houston has some great restaurants that cater to a discerning palate.  This is not one of them.  Just run of the mill stuff trying to be distinctive food.  Skip and go to the Breakfast Klub. Now I will go throw up.
