Uchi////Delicious!! We had 12 dishes and they were all so good it was ridiculous!! The dishes were inventive and unique. Great selection of sake as well. The fried milk was also amazing! Worth the 2 week wait and 40 min wait (despite reservations)!! Have to try, the waitress savannah and other staff were stellar!
