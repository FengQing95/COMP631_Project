Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Though I hate to admit it, Common Bond is the place I go to to pick up a last minute birthday treat for a friend who's birthday I seem to always forget. Â It is within my budget and also, the presentation of these baked goods make them look like the dessert table at a royal wedding.
