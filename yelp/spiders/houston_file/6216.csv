JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the vegan ramen and I am not vegan.  I always try other things when my husband orders them but they are never better than the vegan.  So delicious!  The brussel sprouts are also fantastic.  I need to try some other ramen places but again this is so good I have a hard time switching.  I live in Spring and it is definitely better than any of the Ramen places in the Spring area that I have tried.
