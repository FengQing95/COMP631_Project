Baby Barnaby's////I only stayed in the restaurant for a short while before heading back to work, but I loved the food and the water I was served. Good tasting water is vital to me for any restaurant I visit and Baby Barnaby's made a good impression with theirs. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy my food there along with the water, but portion was very filling with an exceptional price. My waitress was great and I would hope to have her again whenever I make another visit.
