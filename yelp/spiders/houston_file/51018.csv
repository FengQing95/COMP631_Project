Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place just opened up within the last three weeks and I heard good reviews about this place. Be prepared to wait it's slammed busy. I waited over 40 minutes for egg tacos and they were made wrong. The decor is nice and hip. The parking really does suck here. Can it be any smaller? Oh, the people working here kinda looked a little to grungy for me.
