Kata Robata////Kata is easily my second favorite sushi place in Houston after Uchi. Our server, Thai, was extremely personable and attentive. The foie nigiri and spicy soy ramen are my go to's every time I come. The pork belly with 60 degree egg, kobe beef skewer, and rising sun roll were stand outs. The wagyu nigiri, Texas hamachi roll, and a salmon nigiri special for the night were also good but could probably skip for next time. Always great service and fresh sushi when I come.
