Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We decided to Door Dash Snooze for breakfast! We know we didn't make a mistake because the food was awesome. At first I was really skeptical because it was saying that it would take over an hour to deliver, but it took less than 40 minutes to get our food after delivering. I was so impressed at the time of preparing and actually cooking.
