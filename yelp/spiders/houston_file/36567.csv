Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Seriously one of my favorite spots! I had my birthday here last October (I know, a little late on my review) but I had the best experience of my restaurant eating life! Food was amazing of course but I really have to give it to the entire staff. The hosts were extremely accommodating, so was the manager and owner. They were very involved on making my special day perfect! And to top it all off, our waiter Terry was not only an excellent waiter but the most entertaining waiter I've ever had. I will definitely be coming back! Highly recommended!
