Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Is there a wait? Yes. We arrived around 10:15 and waited for about 45 minutes. We enjoyed mimosas while we waited. But keep in mind that you can put you name on the list and they'll contact you when your table is ready. Would definitely recommend for all breakfast lovers in Houston!
