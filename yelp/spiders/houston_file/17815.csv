Uchi////Overall the food was very good and unique, I could tell the chef/staff put a lot of work into the preparation. I just wish it was less work on the presentation/decor so the portions could be a little bigger. I would probably give this place another try since I know what to expect and understand the menu better now. If you wanna get some drinks and a light meal with friends or a date, this is probably a good place to try especially if you like sushi. But if you are very hungry, don't expect to get full unless you order half the menu.
