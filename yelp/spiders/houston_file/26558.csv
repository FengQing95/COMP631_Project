The Pit Room////Just came here for the first time and was very satisfied. The sausages were a bit on the lean side but that is the way i like them. Some of the better seasoned sausages I've had. Brisket was absolutely perfect. I can't say anything about their BBQ sause because i don't use it. I like the taste of the meat so i avoid it unless the meat has to have it. Trust me, what i was served didnt need it at all.
