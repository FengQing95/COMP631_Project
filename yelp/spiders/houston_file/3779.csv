JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alexandra - Thanks for your review. Can you tell me why your service was bad at the bar? As you might imagine, we get lots of complaints about our extended wait times. But like the late, great Yogi Berra once said: "No one goes to that restaurant anymore. It's too crowded." We will be opening more locations in the coming months, which we hope will alleviate some of the crowds. In the meantime, we thank you for your understanding.
