The Pit Room////We came across the Pit on our way to Chinatown for lunch. The name was eye catching, so we did a quick look up in Yelp, and made a u-turn. What an awesome decision! The Pit is one of the better BBQ places in town. Moist version of the brisket is to die for. Flavorful and melts in the mouth. The leaner cut was still good but not great. The regular sausage was excellent. Also had a corn on the cob that was sitting in some type of au jus. It was then sprinkled with cheese and parsley. It was excellent. Only thing that I wasn't impressed with was the cole slaw. It was vinagry but didn't have other flavors. The best thing at the Pit was the coffee and bourbon BBQ sauce. It is AWESOME! The Pit has a regular sauce, which is good. But over by the condiment, pickles and onions bar, there's a bottle of coffee and bourbon sauce. It's much more liquidy than BBQ sauces, but everyone has to try it. Best sauce ever!! Staff was friendly and place was clean. Will definitely go back! Highly recommended.
