JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Blake - Thanks for your review. While we may disagree on whose ramen is better, we can agree on this: Houston is fast becoming the epicenter of excellent, authentic Japanese ramen, and with more ramen-dedicated shops, Houstonians now have more choice, and that, ultimately, is a great thing.
