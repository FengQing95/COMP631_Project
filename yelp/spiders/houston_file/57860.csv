Kata Robata////Kata Robata is always my favorite Japanese restaurant in Houston. We came in Friday afternoon. Wait was about 10 minutes. They have friendly host staffs. Our server was super nice and polite. Very great team Kata Robata has!! All dishes were delicious and pretty presentation. Hot green tea was very tasty as well. Thank you Kata Robata! See y'all soon.
