The Pit Room////On to the food, tacos, tacos, tacos. Ok  I know your thinking BBQ joint and your going for tacos, what the hell is wrong with you? But hear me and my now  I'd consider taco addiction with this establishment. Tacos are done phenomenally here. You got your three choices (I've had them all!): Brisket, pulled pork, & chicken. I'm going to mostly touch on the chicken, brisket is second runner up as the meat is amazing. So chicken...taco...mmm just had me one yesterday. Smoked chicken verde, griddled cheese, charred garlic. The chicken seasoning is close to divine, and that garlic while not great for conversations after consumption is delicious. Not sure if the tortillas are made in house, but they hold up to the task and weight (no broken open soggy incidents have yet to be reported!)
