Kata Robata////Fried green tomatoes & kimchi grits, lobster mac n' cheese, 24 hr. pork belly don! All the food was prepared perfectly!  I was curious about the kimchi grits and fried green tomatoes and it exceeded my expectations.  I am jonesing for those grits as I am typing!  The lobster mac n' cheese was so creamy and delicious.  The pork belly don - awesome!  The poached egg on the dish was unbelievable and hands down the best egg I have ever experienced.  This was like some Iron Chef s@#%!
