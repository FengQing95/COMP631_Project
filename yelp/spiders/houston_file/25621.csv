Uchi////After hearing such great things about Uchi, I had such high hopes for it, but unfortunately, it couldn't deliver for me. To summarize, it just isn't worth the price. I'm giving it 3 stars only cause some of the dishes were actually good and we paid the reduced happy hour prices (just imagine if we paid for the full price).
