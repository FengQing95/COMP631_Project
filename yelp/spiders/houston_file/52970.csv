Kata Robata////They did not have a drink menu per se. The waiter just told me that the bar could make whatever I wanted. He suggested their signature drink the lychee martini which was way too sweet, all lychee and no vodka. The Hamachi & Jalapeno Sashimi would have been excellent with hints of sea salt, fresh jalapeno and yuzu olive oil but they literally drowned it in the olive oil. In this case, less is always better. The spicy tuna rolls were very average. I can think of two other places in town whose spicy tuna would rock the socks off of what I had at Kata Robata.
