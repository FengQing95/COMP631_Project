Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service is mediocre and all three times we have gone, they have messed up our order. Every time has been a weekday when it's not even that busy.... and only with two or three of us. The first time My friend asked for the pretzel sandwich with a fried egg instead of scambled... He got scrambled and was told it would take a while to change it (didn't have the time), another time I ordered the breakfast pot pie, asked for an egg overeasy and got a super raw one, I mean clear raw egg white. So I sent it back and the waiter acted like he was mad at us for not wanting to eat a raw egg. We had had this dish before and it was yummy, this time there was zero sausage in it. Lastly the coffee has tasted burnt every time.... I feel if your a breakfast place you need good coffee. So for a $40 breakfast for two I will not be giving it a 4th chance :(
