The Pit Room////Great bar bq! Nice place and friendly staff! It is kind of pricey though. Â I took my parents and asked them what they thought since they love Pappas and Goode Co., they said it was good but they prefer Goode Co over The Pit Room. I would come back if I was in the area craving some good bar bq. The only thing I wish they served was fries!
