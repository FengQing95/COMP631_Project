JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far the best ramen place we have had. We heard great feedback from this place and decided to try it out. Did not disappoint. We started with the Takoyaki appetizer and it had great flavor and texture. Then ordered the Tonkotsu black and spicy chicken ramen. Both came out delicious! The broth had a well balanced amount of seasoning. What sold us was the noodles. I thought all ramen noodles were all made the same, boy was I proven wrong. They were made fresh and had the right amount of thickness. The meat just melts in your mouth. Look forward to coming back soon!
