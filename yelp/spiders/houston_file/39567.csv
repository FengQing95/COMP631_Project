Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food. We ordered the Pork Belly Poutine, the "Chef's Way" Bosscat Burger, and the Seoul Steak (as a wrap). While our server was outstanding (wish I could remember his name), the food, I'm sorry to say was just ok.  And the reason I'm sad, is because we love BCK Kitchen so much!  The flavors were just not there. And with the Seoul wrap, while beautifully arranged, it was just not practical for eating (it has to be rearranged to fold it up, not a big deal, but I'm a practical person).
