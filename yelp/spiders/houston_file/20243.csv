Uchi////This is my favorite restaurant in Houston. The social menu is a great deal--we order several of our favorites from that menu, get a few things off the regular menu, and share a dessert, and the bill comes in under $100. Little appreciated is how amazing the acoustics are--even when the restaurant is full, you can still hear the people at your table and talk without straining your voice. The food is both delicious and fun (I love the wagyu hot rock), and their desserts are amazing.
