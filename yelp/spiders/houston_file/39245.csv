Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In Summary: The whole experience was solid. The food was good and the drinks were fantastic, albeit a bit expensive. This was a special occasion, so we splurged, but with so many amazing restaurants in Houston, I doubt we'll be regulars. If I worked in the area, I would be down to try their Happy Hour, though.
