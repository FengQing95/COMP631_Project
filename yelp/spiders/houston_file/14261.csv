JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The location is nice as well as the seating area. However, reservations and getting tables is a bit weird; your whole party must be present in order to be seated or taken account for. The food is good, but not exceptional. Would definitely suggest their bbq pork rolls as their "stand out" dish, even though it is an appetizer sort.
