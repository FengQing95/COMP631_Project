Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Ok, I will not be back until the newness wears off. Had a reservation but walked in turned around and told hostess we couldn't stay. So loud you could not carry on a normal conversation at the table. Asked for a quiet table, no such thing. Sad, new restaurants feel like the more noise the better. Oh and their reservation confirmation system didn't work either.
