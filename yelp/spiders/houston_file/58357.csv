Baby Barnaby's////This place is awesome for breakfast!  It is tiny so you have to wait sometimes but it usually does not take too long.  The green eggs are delicious and the waffle is excellent.   The fresh squeezed orange juice is very good and the coffee is strong.  The servers are nice and efficient. The manager is very friendly and takes the time to get to know you even though they are always super busy. One of our favorites!
