Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had to wait an hour an half for a table, so If you come expect a wait. I had huge expectations for the food here, but it definitely wasn't worth the hype. The food was ok, not the best breakfast I've ever had. I got the three egg omelet, nothing special to it, you get to pick three fillings, but it wasn't really enough. It's quite expensive for what you get. I don't think I would come again, not worth the time or money.
