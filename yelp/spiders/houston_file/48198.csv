Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Maybe an off day for them? Came in on Sunday. Mediocre at best. I had the Snooze Spud. Eggs were uncooked when brought to me, onions were not even saut√©ed which was kind of off-putting. Wasn't thrilled by the taste of the food. It was something that I could've made at home without costing as much. I wanted to like this place. The atmosphere is cool and the coffee was good. Service was alright. I'm willing to give them another shot but maybe try something different on the menu.
