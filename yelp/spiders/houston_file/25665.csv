Uchi////Service (3/5): The service tonight was less than subpar. Our dinner started at 7:30 pm and we didn't get one of our appetizers until 10 pm. (It was also on the set menu). Our server had mentioned that they would be "firing" out our items so we were expecting a speedy service with food always presented to us. Well.. that was not how it happened. Our items were coming out maybe 30-40 minutes at a time that for moments we had nothing to eat or drink. The server barely stopped by to check on us and when she did it was very brief. The restaurant had run out of bluefin tuna but she also charged us for the extra pieces we did not receive.
