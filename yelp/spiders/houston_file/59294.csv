Baby Barnaby's////I second Liz S's motion for the breakfast plate, which is two eggs, grits or potatoes (go with the potatoes!), choice of meat, and choice of bread; it's what I always end up ordering when I come to Baby Barnaby's. The pancakes are also good - large and fluffy, and perfect with a seasonal fruit. I can't remember when they took Migas off the menu, but it's a shame because the Huevos Rancheros aren't as good.
