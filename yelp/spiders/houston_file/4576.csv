JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service was poor. Our waiter brought us cold water (it was a chilly Houston night) and when we requested hot water, he said, "We don't have any." He had actually realized that he forgot to bring us hot water about 15 minutes back and was lazy enough to tell us there wasn't hot water.
