Uchi////Be aware that this is not necessarily traditional sushi, this is Japanese inspired dishes, which means that the typical sushi will be dressed up differently or not be sushi at all. It is inspired which means that there are flashes of Japanese prepared dishes with a lot of Western flair added to them. Because there was 4 of us, we decided to order about a dozen different dishes and split them. They were all very delicious and I found myself devouring through the tuna, mackerel and pork belly dishes the most. We did end up ordering a Ham & Eggs Roll that was an interesting taste experience that I'm not sure I care to have again. Dessert was an entirely different experience altogether. I ended up deciding on the fried milk for my birthday dessert. It was definitely a culinary feat, but I wouldn't go so far as saying it was the best dessert I've ever had. It was very good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't the most amazing dessert I've ever had. If you are a chocolate lover, it is absolutely a must-try off the dessert menu.
