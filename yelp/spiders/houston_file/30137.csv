The Pit Room////THE BEEF RIBS ARE A MUST. It was SO juicy and tender and honestly melted in my mouth. The brisket was a little on the tougher and saltier side, so I wished we had only gotten 1/2 a pound of that. The sides were delicious and had no gripes about them. The sauce was amazing too! We drank sweet tea with it and it was delicious. The seating cleared up quick and we were able to get seating. Parking was easy and they also have a private lot!
