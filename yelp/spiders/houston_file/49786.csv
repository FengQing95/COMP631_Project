Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've tried several times at the Montrose location and the newly opened location in the Heights and all the times there's been a long lines.  I just wont wait in long lines!  On this lucky occasion it was early in the a.m. on a week day and was successful to walk in and grab a seat at the bar.  I have to say, I now understand why this place draws a crowd.  Food and service were Johnny on the spot!  So many great choices and I wanted to try them all but my test dish of most breakfast places is how well do they do the standard American breakfast, which includes some sort of eggs, bacon, toast, and hash-browns.  Snooze's equivalent to this is their Snooze Classic.  What elevates their breakfast is you get three eggs, along with good portion of hash-browns.  The eggs were so fresh and tasty, in that the yolks were bright orange.  I also ordered the chorizo sausage which was a patty you could share for two.  Their coffee was equally good and of the same level of quality as their food.  What is surprising for me there was more food than I could finish, which is a very uncommon occurrence. I'll have to make it a priority to get back here again, but I'm still not going to wait in a line.
