JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Their ramen pricing is also very reasonable and ranges from $11-$14 for a bowl. They also have other appetizer options as well, but I would still focus on the ramen. They do have drinks and cocktails available if you want to grab dinner and drinks there. It's nice that the waiting area has a bar, so if you ever have to wait, you can grab a drink.
