JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Does JINYA even need my review? I'm sure from all the amazing experiences here in the previous reviews this is just another to add to the list. Regardless, let me tell you about my experience here EVERY SINGLE TIME I come here. This is my favorite Ramen spot. Not only is the Ramen just super bomb but its great customer service, great vibes, good crowd and I never leave unhappy. What else can you ask for? I usually get the spicy chicken ramen with an egg or the Jinya Tonkotsu Black in chicken broth and chicken. OH, btw they accommodate for those of you who cant have pork broth. Like did you think it would get any better. I took a close friend here for their first ramen experience and they fell in love and now JINYA is one of their top faves in Houston. I pity those who have yet to try this amazing place. Definitely I would say is a staple in Houston.
