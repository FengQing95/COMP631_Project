Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was very good. I ordered the breakfast via the Yelp app. When it arrived to my Airbnb the food was still warm which is a good sign. The staff was very helpful. I asked for cheese in the comment section and within minutes I received a call from the restaurant giving me a list of all the cheeses offered. That was unexpected but I'm glad they were eager to please me. I should've taken a picture of the Snooze Classic before I made a breakfast sandwich but I was too hungry and couldn't wait. Sandwich was delicious! The hash browns were somewhat greasy. Overall it was more than enough food for one person and could possible feed two people. I ordered the French toast also and omg I'm glad I did. The mascarpone was heavenly. The fruit was so fresh. The syrup was the perfect amount of sweetness. My goodness my mouth is watering now just from the memory. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! This place was perfect.
