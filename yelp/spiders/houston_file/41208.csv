Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Updated review,  this place is addictive.  Fruit croissant out of this world (or maybe in vicinity of Paris! - just as great as any I had there).  Had a delectable cauliflower soup and pain Perdu recently and both were delicious. I just read Carrabba's bought this restaurant and although their attitude seems right  (don't mess with what's been working,  get more parking),  I hope they don't screw it up.
