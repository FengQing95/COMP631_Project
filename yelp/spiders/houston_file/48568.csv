Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The gravy on the pot pie was fantastic and the eggs Benedict were the best I've had in Houston! All three pancakes were excellent but my favorite was the blueberry Danish. The peanut butter cup pancake was a bit too rich for me but my girlfriend said it went well with her coffee. The only "negative" thing about the food is their ketchup. It tastes like straight up tomatoes which is a bit weird.
