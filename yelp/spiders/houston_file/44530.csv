Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We walked in to a full restaurant, but with only a few people ahead of us in line. I asked my friends if there were any special procedure to ordering, and then came the twist... This was their first time here too. I was under a strong impression that since they said I needed to try it, it meant they already had. Don't assume anything people!
