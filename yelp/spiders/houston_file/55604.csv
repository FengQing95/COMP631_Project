Kata Robata////On this night, I shared the 72 hour slow cooked Texas kobe beef, the carribean signature roll, toro sashami, foie gras and duck + cold soba, and "Kakuni" pork belly with 60 deg egg. Every menu item I tasted was great! The Texas kobe beef was extremely tender and had a nice pesto dipping sauce. I didn't think the mango in the carribean roll would work. But, I was wrong and the flavors worked splendidly together. The toro sashimi was great. The fish really melted in your mouth and you could definitely tell that it was high quality fish. I've become a recent fan of foie gras. And it was great tasting it in a soba dish. I also enjoyed how the vinaigrette in the soba didn't seem to overpower the dish. I also have to note that the pork belly tasted great and was also super tender.
