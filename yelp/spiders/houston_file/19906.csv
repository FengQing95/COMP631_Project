Uchi////I recently moved to Houston from Los Angeles, and this is the BEST Japanese food I have had.  The fish was so fresh and flavorful.  Everything was insanely delicious.  Definitely go during the (very short) happy hour - really great prices.  We went with a big group, and it was fun. Good environment.  The food is in small plates and comes out at random times, so be prepared for that.  Good hot sake and the fruit dessert was REALLY good.  They had a lot of gluten-free options (and knew what gluten was), which I really appreciated.  I will definitely be back.
