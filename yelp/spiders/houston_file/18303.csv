Uchi////I understand some people will come to Uchi and not like it as much as what it is, but do not listen to all the hype and you will enjoy it. It's very nice that restaurants like this is coming to Houston as the Houston food scene needs to step it up a notch compared to Chicago, New York, and LA.
