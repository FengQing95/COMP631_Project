Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Aside from Octavio the angry bartender, dinner and drinks (with the other bartender Brandon) were awesome. We had the fried oysters (da bomb!!), ahi tuna wraps (mmmm), friend chicken sammich' and the sugar glazed steak. All the food was excellent. Essentially if you don't get Octavio, 10 outa 10.
