Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We got in line to order, and my friend, whose foot was hurt, needed to sit down as the line was pretty long. Â We were ordering his food for him, and we didn't know. The rude manager went over and told him he couldn't save spaces. He said OK, he wouldn't. Then the manger came back twice more to tell him he couldn't sit there. My friend just ignored him, as he had no idea what to do.
