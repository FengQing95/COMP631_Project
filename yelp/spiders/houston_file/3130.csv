JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So from my last review here, I got food poisoning that traumatized me from ever eating seaweed salad anywhere ever again, but I've gone back plenty of times after that ever since they introduced their spicy vegan ramen. Which is probably the best ramen I've ever had in my life. It's so full of flavor and always hits the spot. So I suppose they redeemed themselves and as long I haven't gotten sick since- so I'm pretty content. Their appetizers such as the takoyaki and brussels sprouts never fail to satisfy me. I also have some carnivore friends who also prefer the vegan ramen over the other options.
