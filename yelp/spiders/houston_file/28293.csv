The Pit Room////I was excited to visit this restaurant because of its reviews , but I have to say I'm a little disappointed. We ordered brisket , beef sausage, turkey breast , Mac and cheese , and potato salad . The brisket was on the dry side and had too much spices that all I can taste is the strong taste of black pepper . The turkey was pretty good and moist , mac and cheese was okay . Beef sausages were okay as well. Potato salad was pretty good. I have to say , I have had better bbq for sure .
