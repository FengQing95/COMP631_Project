Local Foods////This was an absolutely delightful restaurant! We came here for lunch, stood in line for about 10 minutes waiting to order our food and seated ourselves at a long community table. I got the Seafood sandwich on a Ciabatta bread and it was divine! I got the chips and Tuscan Kale to go along with it. The homemade chips were amazing. It is a bit pricey for a "sandwich/salad place", but I feel like since you're getting local, fresh foods and a great choice of sides, it's really worth the price. I also got a Cream Soda in a bottle that hit the spot as well! Glad we stopped in!
