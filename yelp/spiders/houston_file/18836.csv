Uchi////A couple of friends wanted to try this place out and found out that they have happy hour starting at 5 ending at 6:30.  They call it "social hour" and have a great menu.  So we arrive around 4:35 not knowing that they didn't open till 5 and we stood around in front of the door chatting and next thing we know, there was a line forming!  We were chit chatting with a couple of others in line and all were apparently repeat patrons who LOVED this place.
