Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is my favorite pastry place in Houston! I am a huge fan of the pistachio croissant, the chocolate walnut cookie, and the fruit tart (the best I've ever had)! It's such a cute brunch and pastry place and there are so many different options. They also have a cafe inside. I like that they have a parking lot and you can avoid street parking if it's not super busy. They have 50% off all of the pastries in the hour before closing every day so I love going during that time. I go here a couple times a week and definitely recommend this place to everyone!
