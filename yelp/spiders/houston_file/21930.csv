Uchi////Second, we were told to wait 30 minutes so they can figure out if tables become available due to no-shows, and we were 'politely' shooed to the patio or wine bar area. We insisted we will wait for a table, and the seating staff 'professionally' promised they would find us when a table is available. But 45 minutes later when I approached them myself, I was told they figured we no longer needed tables because we sat down at the wine bar and ordered some snacks. Such 'fake' professionalism to usher in the long line of innocent bystanders to populate their wine bar and outdoor patio (likely also for PR purposes) is simply unsettling to see.
