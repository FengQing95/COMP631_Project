Local Foods////The two times that I've been here I've ordered the Crunchy Chicken sandwich. I was planning on getting something else the second time but this sandwich is too darn good to pass up. It comes with cheese, nuts, veggies, and generous slices of chicken. The pretzel bun is perfect. If you order a different sandwich I would recommend substituting for the pretzel bun. It's definitely worth it!
