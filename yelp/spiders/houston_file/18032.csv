Uchi////As soon as we sat down, it took a little while for our waitress to come over, but it seemed like she was spread thin. However, her attitude was still enthusiastic, friendly, and helpful, despite being busy. The ambiance here was fantastic - the lighting, the materials, and the design of the place is perfect for a group meal or an intimate meal with a date. I liked the personality of the restaurant because it doesn't feel too upscale, but more comfortable and welcoming.
