The Pit Room////The entire establishment smells strongly of smokiness. Which you should expect from a barbeque place. Though it does make me wonder if they use a different type of wood to smoke their meats, or if they add liquid smoke. Other than that, the restaurant has a great atmosphere, plenty of outdoor seating at the bar next door.
