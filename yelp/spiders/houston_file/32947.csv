Local Foods////This is a laid-back joint. You stand in line, order your food, get a number, and hope that you can find a seat. I was eating a late lunch with 3 girlfriends and I was lucky enough to grab a table inside (mind you, it was 2:00 on a Saturday and it was PACKED). I decided to do splitsies with one of my friends: I got the fall harvest salad with chicken, she got the falafel sandwich with kale and beets as sides (but they gave quinoa instead. oops!). And we got a kombucha to split. Kombucha (exclusively made for Local Foods) was great: burst of fermentation goodness, with hints of fruit flavors. Fall harvest salad was AMAZING! Never have I enjoyed a salad with no dressing as much as I did this one. Juicy, flavorful pieces of thinly-sliced chicken on a bed of greens, alfalfa sprouts, roasted (delicious) brussel sprouts, pomegranate seeds, pumpkin and nice, creamy chunks of goat cheese. I couldn't stop eating it. My friend's falafel sandwich was okay. I've had better falafel (I'm looking at you, Falafel Stop). The sides (though one of them was incorrect) was very fresh, vibrant and delicious. And though, this may be TMI,... let's just say the food made me very regular :)
