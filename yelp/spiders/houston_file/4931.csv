JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had an amazing experience here. Just moved to the area and was in search for a good ramen shop. Found JINYA on yelp and looked promising. They have a lot of options for bowls and a variety of a la cartel toppings for your noodles as well. Having visited ramen shops in a lot of other cities, this one definitely deserves a visit. The steamed pork bun was a great started and my order of the JINYA Tonkotsu Black came out very quickly. It had a very full flavor and a lot of great add ins. The service was excellent and the atmosphere provides a level of authenticity to the experience. I'll definitely be back for another bowl soon.
