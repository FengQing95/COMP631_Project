JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Rose - Thank you for your review and feedback. I'm disappointed to hear about your experience at our restaurant, especially since you have visited us on other occasions. First allow me to address your service. I am currently investigating the mishandling of your seating. I believe the act of knocking over the server's tray of waters created a certain amount of discord that required immediate attention, mostly because wet floors in any high-traffic establishment can be very dangerous.
