Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really enjoyed the pancakes and the drinks I had. It was refreshing to see a significant amount of thought and variety put into a brunch cocktail menu for a change. My only big complaint was the pretty striking lack of insight into how parties should be seated efficiently. I was there with a party of 6 but ran into friends in a party of 2. We didn't request to sit together and they'd only arrived maybe 10 minutes before us but we were seated nearly an hour after them and they were placed in a booth that could've easily sat 4 or more. I've never run a restaurant and know brunch crowds are inherently crazy but seems the ball was somewhat dropped here. Also, the drinks at the bar took far too long after we ordered (some other patrons standing waiting with me also complained, so I'm confident I'm not being crazy here).
