Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Before going to Houston I had this bookmarked as so many of my Yelp friends adored the place. OMG was this place terrific probably the best breakfast in the State of Texas if this was located in South Florida I would be a regular. Hint hint please open more locations. They originated in Colorado and are in Texas, California and Arizona. Nice free street parking out front. No wait as we came here on a Monday morning. The menu was terrific I love the calorie count next to each item.
