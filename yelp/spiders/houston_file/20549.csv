Uchi////Probably my favorite sushi joint. food presentation is very important here. everything comes out looking like art. food taste amazing. very unique and very flavorful. ham and eggs is one of my favorite dishes to get. the walu walu is very flavorful. portion sizes are very small, tapas style. machicure was crispy and smoky yummy. if you want to make it to 5o clock happy hour line up at 440. if it's your first time i recommend ordering everything on the HH menu.
