Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kouign Amann - 5.0/5.0 - Another huge pastry, this gem is pretty hard to find in Houston, let alone in any American French bakery. For those unfamiliar with this butter cake, imagine the best croissant molded into a round cake form, lovingly baked with layers of sugar and butter until its crust is caramelized and hardened while keeping its insides fluffy and flaky like a croissant. You NEED this in your life.
