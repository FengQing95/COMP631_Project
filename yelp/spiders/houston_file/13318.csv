JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is one of my favorite ramen places in Houston, and the tonkotsu black is probably my go-to here. I've tried to think of how to criticize the ramen here and came up pretty empty- what can I possible say, that the broth is too rich? If I were rating this place off of ramen alone, I'd easily give it five stars, but there were a few things I disliked about some of JINYA's other offerings. I was able to try the pork gyoza and chashu bowl, both of which had their goods and bads. The pork gyoza were cooked perfectly (loved the contrast between the crispy bottom and the tender skin and filling), but were a tad too oily for me. The chashu bowl packed decent flavor, but I had two related criticisms here. One, that the ratio of fat to lean pork was too high for my liking. Two, that although the spinach did what it could to cut down on the fattiness of the pork given what I mentioned in one, it simply didn't do enough. I understand the idea of having the cold spinach create a nice balance in the bowl, but the spinach also didn't taste seasoned to me, which I didn't really understand. Perhaps a nice acidic vinagrette style sauce/dressing would help in regards to both one and two.
