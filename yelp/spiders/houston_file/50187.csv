Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze, an A.M. Eatery is a very accurate name for restaurant. You definitely have to get up in the A.M. for sure in order to even get a seat in here. Off the top of my head, I can count about 8 or 9 separate occasions where I have tried to come to Snooze at different times of the morning, but have only ever gotten in twice because the wait times are ridiculously long and my friends and I don't want to wait for an okay breakfast.
