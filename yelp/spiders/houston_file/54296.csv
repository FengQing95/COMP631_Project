Kata Robata////Kata is way better than Uchi. If you're a fan of fresh fish and traditional style sushi, you'd love it here. I've been here quite a few times, and I'd say that my favorites are the kobe beef skewers, sushi platter with tropical spicy tuna roll, yuzu salmon sashimi, uni pasta, spicy ramen, and rising sun roll.
