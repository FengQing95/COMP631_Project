JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When people think of Ramen they think of packaged noodles out the box.  But, you have to try it to see that it's not the same thing! Jinya Ramen offers decent Ramen with a wide range of flavors.  But, it gets a bit salty after eating and sippng on the Ramen broth halfway through.  The appetizers are delicious and uniquely made.  Overall the food is pretty good and the the waiters are friendly and helpful.  It might be a bit pricey for Ramen but there are delicate ingredients involved so the price is comparable to other Ramen joints.
