Local Foods////Menu includes a decent variety of sandwiches, made it a bit tough to decide but the knowledgable cashier suggested the shrimp/crab with greek goddess dressing, I chose the kale salad and also the fresh made potato chips. I saw a variety of sodas and beer but since I had to return to work was limited on my beverage choices.
