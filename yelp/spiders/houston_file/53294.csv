Kata Robata////Waited over an hour for my food because the staff was bad at keeping up with the Saturday night rush. No apologies were made, no comment except "the girls must have not seen you, did you come up?" Saw everyone around me waiting close to two hours for a table. The food was not up to par, definitely prefer Oishii's. Much more authentic food and experience. Infinitely better staff as well.
