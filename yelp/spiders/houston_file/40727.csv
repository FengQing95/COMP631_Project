Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service was great, but I have to take this place down a notch because I was expecting more of a fine dining kind of experience. It was more like a fancy sports bar. Lots of screens playing. It was so dark we couldn't read the menu. Not kid friendly. Â Music was too loud. Saw the high rating and thought it was worth a try. It was but probably won't be back any time soon.
