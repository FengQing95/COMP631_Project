Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Overall, the food was pretty good, but nothing that I would wait in a line for. And the service was okay (you order at the counter, but they bring you your food). But Common Bond is just too crowded and loud - and, in my humble opinion, not worth the wait, line, or crowds. An a-okay place, but nothing out of the ordinary!
