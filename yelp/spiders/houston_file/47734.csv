Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place' s food is the bomb. There is usually a wait of some kind, I think the longest I've had to wait may have been like 45 minutes (I'm guessing). Food came out in what id consider a decent time considering they stay packed. If you don't care for tight spaces this may not be best for you, but otherwise I really like the place.
