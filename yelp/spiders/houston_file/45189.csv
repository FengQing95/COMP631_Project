Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been here many times and the heavenly almond croissants are what keeps me coming back for more. They are huge, with a flakey and buttery outside, and a mildly sweet almond filling that is addicting. Definitely recommend getting this if it's your first time. Take one to go like I usually do. They still taste amazing the day after. There's also so many gorgeous and yummy looking desserts, you really can't go wrong. Try a macaron! Not into sweets? They also serve a brunch/lunch menu which changes monthly. I have tried some dishes here and they and all have been delicious. The chefs here definitely know what they are doing. They are also now open for dinner now which they weren't in the past fyi.
