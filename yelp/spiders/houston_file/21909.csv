Uchi////As someone who was born and raised in Houston (the city New York Times calls "the most exciting place to eat") I've been to my fare share of amazing restaurants. But honestly, Uchi is my absolute favorite restaurant in this city. Haven't tried one dish I didn't drool over. Probably spend way too much money here (my boyfriend and I order almost the entire menu when we go...oops) but it's oh so worth it. I always recommend Uchi to out of town friends...even printed out/highlighted/and color coded a menu for my friend who was going to take her parents there to help then decide what to order (a little overboard, but I'm a foodie what can I say). I mean just read the reviews. You'll love it.
