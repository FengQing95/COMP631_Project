Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the steak and egg flatbread and this dish was okay in my opinion. I think slices of steak would be a better compliment to this dish than the steak they had. It kinda reminded me as if it were pulled pork. The flat bread was yummy, just needed a little more crisp to it.
