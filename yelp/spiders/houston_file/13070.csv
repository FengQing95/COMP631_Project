JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really wasn't too big of a fan of the broth, it was too watery and it had chunks of garlic and ginger, reminded me of a half assed version of fideo (w/o the ginger) lol. It's pretty pricy as well. I got an extra slice of pork for $2 and it was half the size of my palm and cold. When I dumped it in my broth it pretty much cooked it down cause it was that cold.
