Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Drinks were delicious. I'm not a whisky drinker but had to try their specialty. 38 special was like a tasty and sweet Manhattan and sweet tea was just like it sounds. I'd get them both again. I had the veggie/black-eyed pea sandwich. It was delicious and filling. I loved it and will be back for it. Service was wonderful. We had Jose who was so kind and positive, as well as super knowledgeable. Atmosphere was upbeat and fun. The clientele was very diverse but it wasn't a pickup scene, which is nice.
