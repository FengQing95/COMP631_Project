Uchi////Maybe it was the fact that we had heard so many good things about this place before trying it, but after ordering the avo bake, fried brussel sprouts, and the asparagus (daily special) as appetizers, we were pretty underwhelmed. The avo bake and the brussel sprouts were okay, but I would never get the asparagus again- miniature portion served in a huge plate with 5 arugula leaves.
