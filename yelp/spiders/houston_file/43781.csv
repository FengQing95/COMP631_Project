Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Then they have a kitchen and on the weekends the menu is fantastic. You call tell the menu and chefs are quality. The selections aren't typical and have some European, Mexican, and American influence. Â Love everything I've had there even when out of my normal scope.
