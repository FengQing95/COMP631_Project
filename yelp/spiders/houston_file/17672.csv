Uchi////Well it has FINALLY happened!!  Uchi has come to Houston and if you are ready for multiple foodgasms, you have come to he right place!!!  With only one week under their belt, last night's event was unparalleled!  From the incredible atmosphere, the remarkable staff to the sashimi 'like butta' it was an event I never wanted to see end!  The 'chips and dip' (micro lettuce with puréed edamame) and the roasted brussel sprouts with chili sauce were highlights of the prepared dishes.  The sashimi could NOT have been any fresher!!  Only the smell and taste of the purest of pure!!
