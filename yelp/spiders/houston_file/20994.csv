Uchi////First time ever at Uchi, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed.  Despite the popularity of this place, the wait wasn't really bad.  If you're willing to sit at the bar, you can bypass much of the line.  I managed to snag a pair of seats right after walking in.  Otherwise the wait would have been 45 minutes - long but not a deal breaker.
