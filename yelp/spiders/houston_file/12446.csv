JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Patty - Thank you very much for the review. Very glad you enjoyed our fare. While parking can be a pain, the fact that the parking garage around the corner is free does help, and the valet service on the first floor doesn't charge, although the valet guys do accept tips. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
