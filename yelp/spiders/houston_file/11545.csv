JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite part of the meal was the annin tofu! It is a beautifully crafted dessert dish with the right amount of sweetness. The pudding was so soft and just melted in my mouth. There is actually no tofu in that dish and I highly recommend you to try it. I think I could eat that dish multiple times in one sitting if my wallet allowed it. Sadly, I had to share it with three other people and clearly, we should have all ordered one each. Overall, a fun place to enjoy ramen with good company!
