Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Really cute spot! I love the overall atmosphere. Very cozy, and perfect for after-church casual brunch. Ordered the Lox and it was amazing! The Nutella latte is seasonal I assume and also delicious. Hope to be back soon to try more of the delicious-looking pastries. I wish I could've sampled them all!
