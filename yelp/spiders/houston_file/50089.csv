Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I waited an hour and a half and I have no regrets!! Grab a bloody mary and hang out while you wait. You can't leave without trying pancake flight. All of the flavors are delicious. The egg dishes are awesome too. Great place for a tasty brunch, but only if you're not in a hurry.
