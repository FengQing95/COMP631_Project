JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Ramen was a pleasant surprise considering ramen restaurants seem to be popping up all over Houston as of late. I had the Jinya Tonkotsu Black ramen with the pork gyoza & salad. The salad was bland and didn't taste like anything and the gyoza was decent but I'd probably skip getting the combo. The ramen was solid though! The pork broth was a little thicker than I'm used to but it was very tasty and I liked the seasoned egg that was included in the ramen. The pork wasn't as tender as some other places in New York but it wasn't bad. I was also surprised to be seated immediately when coming for dinner in a group of 3 at 7pm. There is a long table in the middle that they seat people together "community" style but if you come in groups of 2, you may be able to get seated separately in small booths. The service was pretty good too considering it was semi-busy. I'd definitely be back if I need another ramen fix!
