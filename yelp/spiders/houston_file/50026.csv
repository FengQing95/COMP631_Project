Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As far as what we ordered, we're Eggs Benedict fans, so we ordered two Benny duos and had a taste of the chili verde, Bella Bella, lox/caper, and Chilaquiles.  I'm sure I botched a couple of the names, sorry!  My favorite was the Bella Bella by far.  I just wish I ordered the full order.  Drunk'n Monkey French toast, OMG.  Banana bread, topped with mascarpone cream, mixture of nuts, fried banana, and toffee rum drizzle.  Best dish, but for those with high blood sugar, beware!!! I personally would get this to share.  Two-three bites and my dessert fix was fulfilled
