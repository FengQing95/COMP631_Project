Baby Barnaby's////Parking is pretty limited to street parking, but there are some back roads behind the restaurant which worked for us. My friend and I definitely chose the worst time to come - 11 am on a Sunday, and our wait was ~40 minutes which was pretty unfortunate. There is a bit of seating, both covered and uncovered, for patrons to wait for tables to be free.
