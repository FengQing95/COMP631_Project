The Pit Room////Not a fan.  After reading all the dynamic reviews, my husband and I stopped by last night along with a couple of guests to try them out. No one at our table was interested in finishing their food. It missed the mark for all of us. In my opinion, the layer of dry rub used on the meat is too thick, it completely kills the meat flavor, all you taste is dry rub...meat is somewhat of an aftertaste if you are able to taste it at all. The house made sausage are just ok, they lacked flavor and depth for me.  The chicken was dry and chewy instead of moist and supple. The brisket was moist but overpowered by the dry rub. The ribs had a very thin layer of meat topped with a thick layer of dry rub...they were as close to meatless ribs and you can get.  The mac and cheese was very cheesy, the corn was bitter, the ranch beans were ok but again lacked depth and flavor, the greens beans were salty and the potato salad was pretty decent. I'm shocked so many people have given this place 5 stars, it is beyond fathomable. I'm thinking they have never eaten at places like Corkscrew or Killeens BBQ. If you want good authentic lick your fingers Texas BBQ, that will have you purchasing extra plates to go before leaving the restaurant, this is not the place....default to one of the two previously mentioned places. However, if you want authentic looking BBQ in a trendy area, you've found it.
