JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After a few visits to Jinya, now I am convinced that I can abandon my ritual at the airport. I have tried their black tonkotsu, spicy chicken, and spicy umami miso and liked everything so far. Both the soup and noodle are robust. Also the small dishes, gyoza, fried chiken, chashu bowl were all pretty good, though not too keen on brussel sprouts.
