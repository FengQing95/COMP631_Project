JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////To be fair, sometimes we miss the mark. And when we do, we try our best to make things right by our customers. But if we aren't able to register customers' complaints when they are inside the restaurant, this makes our job much more difficult. Regardless, please know that my entire staff and I take your review very seriously and want nothing more than to do by right by you, especially since you said you had been one of our regular customers.
