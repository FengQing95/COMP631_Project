Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Mebu was innovative. Presentation was great. Food tasted...adequate, albeit over-priced for what you actually receive, but hey this is Montrose where you are paying to be seen (I guess). Â Service was sluggish initially but eventually gaine inertia. Bringing in a large group in really derails the staff. It took about 45 minutes to get us all seated. I am not sure why; apparently they forgot about their entirely vacant patio tables.
