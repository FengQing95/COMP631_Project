Local Foods////The big draw here is the quality of their ingredients.  They use fresh, quality ingredients from local farms and I suspect that they bake their own bread, which is delicious.  They have unique sides that are fresh, tasty, and possibly healthy (how can raw vegetables have so much flavor??).  The service is also fantastic here.
