Local Foods////This place is fantastic. Its located out of the center of the rice village. Theres ample seating and tables. You walk in and order at the counter. I love the crispy chicken sandwich and the asian chicken salad. The salad is big enough for two. I have always had to split it. It feels so healthy when I eat this. Its a great place for lunch or just a light dinner. The service is not noticeable since all they do is take your order, but that is fine. They have to go containers for whatever you do not finish.
