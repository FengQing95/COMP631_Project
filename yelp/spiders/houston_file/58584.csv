Baby Barnaby's////i was perusing some of the other reviews, and noticed that some made mention of "complimentary" coffee.....since i have been coming here(October), there has been a sign above the outdoor coffee station that explicitly states that the coffee is offered on a "honor system" basis, and one is to take their mug to the table to ensure you pay for it.
