Uchi////Uchi is yummy yummy!  Wow! It's been a long time since I experienced "pretty" food that not only taste good but got me full as well. All the Sushi entrees were savory and delightful to eat. The presentation was fabulous and service was top notch.  And Bravo to Chef Rob!  He made sure we were happy with every plate!  Looking forward to Uchi again soon
