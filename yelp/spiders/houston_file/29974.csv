The Pit Room////The coleslaw was nothing special and nothing less than lacking in flavor. There was more dressing "liquid" in my container than slaw. On the other hand, my 2nd side was delicious. Out of everything, I would recommend the mac n cheese, which I had a feeling would be good due to the type of noodle used. The extra crevices around the elbow noodles helps the cheesy thick sauce hug onto each noodle so that each bite has both the pillow texture of the noodle and the softness of the sauce.
