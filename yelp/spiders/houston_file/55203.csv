Kata Robata////Came here on date night with the fianc√© and we were in love with this place. It had been a long time since we found a restaurant that we both love in Houston. It felt like something we would experience on a vacation and not within our city limits. Anyway, we made reservation thru Yelp on our way there but for some reason it didn't show up in their system so we had to wait a little bit for our table. Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. After spending about 15 mins on Yelp and still not knowing what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations and pretty much ordered everything based on his recommendations.
