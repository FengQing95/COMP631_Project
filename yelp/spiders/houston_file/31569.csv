Local Foods////I am obsessed with Local Foods! I am always scared the parking is going to be an issue with it being right next to is buddy Benjy's but I haven't had a problem yet. I was having issues getting to Local Foods before they closed but they have extended their hours till 8 so I can always get there after work now! I'm so excited!!!
