Uchi////This was one of my favorite dinning experiences hands-down. I ate here with my family and at one point in the meal my mom had her eyes closed and after asking her if she was okay she turned to me and said, "I don't know what I just ate but it was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth." The staff is all very friendly and eager to offer suggestions. Looking forward to having an excuse to return.
