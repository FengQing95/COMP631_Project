The Pit Room////I'm actually editing my last review because this is my second time eating here and I finally took some pics and enjoyed it even more than the first. Just recently moved to Houston and this is my favorite bbq/tex mex restaurant so far! Never enjoyed brisket before this restaurant. Love the drink selection. A must eat place in Houston.
