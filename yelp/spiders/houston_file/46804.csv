Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My coworkers and I love coming here after a long night shift in the Emergency Department! They have half priced drinks for medical center workers on Mondays and Tuesday's you just have to be in your scrubs and I think have your badge. You have to get their Bloody Mary at least once. They are the perfect amount of spicy. Pancakes are huge and so good even better than iHop I think. Honestly all the food is good, just go!
