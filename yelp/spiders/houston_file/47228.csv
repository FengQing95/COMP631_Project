Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We wanted a delicious and easy breakfast while we were stopping by in Houston and that's exactly what we got. The service was fantastic and that started as soon as we walked in the door. There was a 10 minute wait but it's so worth it! The food is delicious and the portions are not unrealistic, but still so full!
