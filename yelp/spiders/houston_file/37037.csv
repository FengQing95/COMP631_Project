Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ate here recently and the food and drinks are phenomenal. It's a great place to grab a drink, go on a date or dine with a group of friends. The burger and braised short ribs are my favorite but also be sure to try the appetizers the meatloaf bites and pulled pork hush puppies are great! I was there with a large group and Cameron Ray the manager and Cameron Jones our server took amazing care of us. Usually when eating with a large group things are slow and a little chaotic but that was not the case at Boscat. Everything came out correct and fast!
