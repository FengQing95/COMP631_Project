Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is basically the sweetheart of Houston bakeries, so I have a feeling I'm going to be in the minority here with my 3-star rating. Food and ambiance get 4 stars, really, but overall my experience was about a 3. I would happily come back here - and probably will - but I can't say I'd go out of my way to come here the way I would other places.
