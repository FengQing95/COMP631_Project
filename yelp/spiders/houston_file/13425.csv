JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have tried the vegetarian ramen a few times.  The broth is decent, and the ramen is seasoned with black pepper and ample vegetables.  At times, the broth can be a bit too bland, but you are able to add the spicy sauce to it for an additional cost, which adds a much-needed kick to the broth.  Also, adding a seasoned egg really adds to the dish.
