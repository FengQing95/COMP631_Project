Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking wasn't too bad, we had to park in a Jack in the box across the street which had loads of spaces. I will say the only annoying thing about snooze is the wait, yet it's understandable because of its popularity. We went on a weekday so the wait time was for only 45 mins, plus they gave us free pancakes to compensate for the time!
