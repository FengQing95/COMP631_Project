Kata Robata////Quality has vastly gone down., they even quit serving rolls with cream cheese. The presentation on the sushi went from a gorgeous glass platter to an ordinary slate. Quality of sushi pieces actually so tough I couldn't bite with my front teeth!!!! I guess all things come to an end.   Even the lobster Mac and cheese presentation is lacking the lobster !!! Oh and I'm convinced they are using less cheese in the Mac./ substituted for more bechamel sauce.   One word::: Downhilll
