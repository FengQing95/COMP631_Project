JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lisa - I'm sorry our ramen didn't quite float your boat. May I ask which ramen you ordered? Please know that you customers can request any of our ramen dishes to be served with "Less Salt" or "Less Oil," or with just about any modification that's within our means. I am glad to hear, however, that our service met your approval. And lastly, did you park across the street from the restaurant? If so, yes, there are limited spaces; however, there is a free, large parking garage around the corner whose entrance can be found on Elgin between Louisiana and Milam. The ground floor has free valet parking (tipping is customary), but you can also park yourself on any of the upper levels, free of charge. Thank you for your visit.
