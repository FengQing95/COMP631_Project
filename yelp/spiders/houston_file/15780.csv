JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Bumping it up to a shiny 5-star. After coming here a few times at both locations, it has become my favorite ramen place in town. Parking is limited in the area, but there is a garage parking around the corner. Expect a wait if you come during their peak time. If you don't want to wait then come on a weekday around the afternoon. On weekends especially for dinner, the wait is about 15-30min.
