Local Foods////I think I must have somehow missed the bus on Local Foods. Everyone I know who has tried the place out adores it, but each time I go, it's a complete miss. The food is nothing short of bland, and while it's obvious that they prepare everything fresh and with great individual ingredients, the combinations are lost on me. On paper, everything looks fabulous. On the plate? Not so much. I've tried ordering several different items, and I have yet to find something that hits the spot. Sorry, Local Foods. I want to like you so much, but all I can muster is "eh."
