Kata Robata////Experience/Service 3/5: The towel they use for your hands, its nice and a lot of japanese restaurants in NYC also do it. But the towel was way to rough and large. It felt like I was using a hot table towel to wipe my hands. The AC was not above us they should get one of those anglers to install where the AC blows up. It was way too cold. As a restaurant with this pricing, there should also be a place to set your chop sticks..
