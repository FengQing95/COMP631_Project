Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great bakery cafe  however it's too pricey and there's a bit hassle with parking situation.  Most everything is good except the plain croissant is dry & hard on the shell.  I'm a big fan of French bakery so I will visit again and hope there's some improvement so it can be a special place for French cafe.
