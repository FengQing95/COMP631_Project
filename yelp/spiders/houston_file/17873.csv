Uchi////2) The bar area right by the dining area. Yes I get it, when you're waiting on your table or you are a walk in, you are directed to wait at the bar or outside. Great for if you're waiting, but sucks big hairy monkey balls when you have a table right by the bar. While trying to enjoy your dinner (or even hear what the servers are bringing you), you have to talk over people standing at the bar talking to their companions over your heads. It def takes away form the dining experience! Someone in Uchi's design staff really overlooked the concept of space/ambiance planning there.
