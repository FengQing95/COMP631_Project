Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was really looking forward to trying out Bosscat from all the great food pictures and menu. I went today for brunch and the menu is very limited. They do have this fruity pebbles French toast that looks amazing but not much of a sweet tooth person. I ordered there chicken fried steak based on the recommendation of the waiter. It looked absolutely perfect! The meat was tender and perfectly fried! Unfortunately, it was very disappointing! It had no flavor at all and the gravy isn't a traditional brown gravy. It was a gumbo style gravy that also lacked flavor. For the price, I expected a much better meal! I would give 5 stars for the service my waiter provided. After he asked me how my food came out, I told him it was perfectly cooked but lacked flavor. He told me he would bring me some seasoning to add and it did a bit but was disappointed. I saw him being very helpful with everyone and taking care of them like they where his only guests he had.
