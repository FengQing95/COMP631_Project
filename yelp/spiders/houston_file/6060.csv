JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Edgar - Thank you for your review. We do have a strict policy regarding our seating procedures, as it is designed to keep it fair for everyone. But I can understand your frustration if and when the house isn't full. I will speak to our hosting staff about this particular matter. From the sound of it, you should have been seated and allowed to wait until your friends arrived.
