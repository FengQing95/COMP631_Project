Uchi////I went to the Sake Social Hour by myself last week when I got out of work early. Everything was delicious! Only thing I wouldn't order again is probably the sake crudo since it was quite overwhelmingly salty, I believe there is rock salt added to this dish so perhaps I would request the dish sans the extra salt. Everything was so fresh, bartender was well-informed and helpful with making choices.
