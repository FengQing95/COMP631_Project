Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came early on a week day when business was slow, and I was disappointed by the lack of service. We waited 20 minutes for someone to come take our order, and then had to ask for jam and hot sauce after the food arrived, which took the waiter another 20 minutes to come back with. It was frustrating to have someone walk back and forth past you, forgetting each time to bring condiments. No idea what could have taken so long with only 10 or so patrons in the restaurant. The food wasn't good enough to make up for the poor service. I wouldn't recommend it.
