Kata Robata////-Miso crusted bone marrow: The idea is you scoop out the marrow and place it on bread with pickled onions and pickled mustard seeds. Sprinkle a little salt on it to complete your bite and...have you read/seen Twilight? I think my taste buds imprinted on this dish, it was just ridiculously good. **Highly** recommend ordering this when you're here.
