Baby Barnaby's////Cut to the next morning where not only did staff yell across the tiny room to communicate over guests dining instead of coming over and talking to you like a decent human being, but when we requested to sit outside to eat breakfast they said they only serve lunch there and we would have to wait until 11. Mind you the other Barnabys locations told me it was a "breakfast joint" given its shorter hours so it seems strange to create a line of demarcation for eggs: we serve breakfast inside but not outside even though it's a foot away and really makes no difference to us; we just like to make rules for no apparent reason. Normally this wouldn't be a big issue, but given the fact I called beforehand to make sure they could do this and that other Barnabys suggested it to me AND my friend had to go to her job soon, I asked if we could sit outside and eat breakfast now. They swiftly declined and said that we could tie our dog outside and eat inside or wait for lunch outside. That doesn't really sound like "pet friendly" to me Â given that even a grocery store has that philosophy and it doesn't consider itself as "pet friendly". When I approached the manager I mentioned that I had called the evening earlier asking if we could be accommodated and that they confirmed that we'd be able to eat breakfast w my dog outside, he rudely didn't even look at me and said with attitude "well we've been doing this for years so I don't know who would've told you" and brushed me off. We were so appalled I thought why should I give my business to a place who clearly doesn't care to have it and walked over to Cafe Gratifi who was able to serve us w great food and service and was ACTUALLY pet friendly for breakfast! Imagine that!
