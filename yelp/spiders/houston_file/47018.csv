Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// after 45 minutes, i inquired. i was told that they had texted me twice already--this is demonstrably false.  i asked them to call my phone using the number i gave them originally.  the young lady was reluctant to do it, but she did, and my phone rang.   they clearly had the right number.   an employee in an orange shirt  said "don't worry, you are now at the top of the list."  i waited another ten minutes, and after seeing a number of folks being seated, i inquired again.   they claimed to have texted me again.  (my cell phone records show that is not the case.) then, the guy in the orange shirt said that they thought that i left.  (if one story doesn't work, then try another.)
