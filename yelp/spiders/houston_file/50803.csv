Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was outstanding and even brought us a free pancake on the house. Drinks were strong, yet tasty. I ordered the breakfast tacos and they were great as well. Overall, the wait time was the only issue but if you put yourself on the list before heading to the restaurant it helps out a ton.
