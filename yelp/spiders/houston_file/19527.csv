Uchi////I am in LOVE! it's ridiculous how great the food is. every bite is heaven. it's all seasoned to perfection.  It was our first time there and we were not disappointed. Will definitely be going back, back, back and back again! We barely scratched the surface of the menu. So much more to try.  Here's what we had and loved!!
