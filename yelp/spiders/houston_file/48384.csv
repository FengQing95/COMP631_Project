Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you have never been to the Pink Elephant in NY, this place will surely make you feel like it. Long, long, long lines masquerading as "super busy happening spot" when almost 50% of tables are empty. The service is unfriendly and I'm being generous here. The food is, well, I think I just whipped up some of the same crap at home last week. And the strangest thing, they only carry wheat beers for their beer selections. I don't know why that bothers me so much, but it does. So, if you want to stand in line for hours and feel like you are getting into the Pink Elephant (which was actually worth the wait btw), only to go inside to be met with bad service and eat some eggs, prepared exactly like you would at home, by all means get in line NOW! You may eat by the end of the week. And the parking situation...Don't even get me started.
