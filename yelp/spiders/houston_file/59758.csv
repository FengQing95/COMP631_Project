Baby Barnaby's////We decided to come here after the wait for the Breakfast Klub was over an hour.  Our group of 9 was quickly seated within 20 minutes at one of the tables on the porch.  Thankfully they had plenty of fans going and plenty of water jugs to keep us cool in the hot & humid Houston morning.
