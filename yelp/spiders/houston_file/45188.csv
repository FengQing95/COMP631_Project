Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking lot is tiny and can be a pain to find one in there, especially on a Saturday morning. If all else fails, search for street parking. As far as the lines to order, Saturday peak morning times are usually packed. I have seen the line go almost out the door but it usually moves quickly. Late afternoon, say 1pm and after, is when it starts quieting down.
