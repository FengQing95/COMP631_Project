The Pit Room////How I wish there were more barbeque places like this in south Florida, where I'm from. But all the cuts of meat here were so moist and tender! They were all so great! We tried the ginormous beef rib, the brisket, and the pulled pork. All so unbelievably tender. The sides were good too. Had the okra, chili, mac and cheese, and potato salad. But the star of the show were definitely the meats. A must try!
