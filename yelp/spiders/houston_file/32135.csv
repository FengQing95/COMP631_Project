Local Foods////The sandwich was delicious and the perfect portion. There was a generous helping of seafood which had a very delicate taste and not slathered in sauces or mayo like I expected. The sides were similarly fresh with great mixings of veggies. I loved how healthy and filling the meal was and everything seems reasonably priced (but beware, the seafood sandwich was a whopping $14).
