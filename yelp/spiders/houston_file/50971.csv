Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First time here this morning. We checked in at 11:30 and sat down at 12:30. It was well worth the wait. So, you can check in and they will text you when the table is ready. Parking is horrible and you most likely won't be able to park in front the place. I parked across the street at Kroger's.
