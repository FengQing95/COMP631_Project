JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love Love Love Ramen! I go at least 4 or 5 times out the month. I went last Friday and was upset with the host for making me wait to be seated as I waited on a friend. That was the first time ever but I know business is business. Definitely introduce all my friends here. Highly recommended if you guys are looking for a nice size bowl of ramen for a reasonable price.
