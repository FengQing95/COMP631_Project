JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA = AMAZING! I had no idea JINYA is from Tokyo + California. My husband and I are new to Houston and we were in search of some delicious ramen. We were hoping JINYA would be the place to fulfill all our hopes and dreams and we were not disappointed. We both love their JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen! The broth is rich in flavor, cloudy and opaque just the way we like it. This one comes with thin noodles, which definitely is chewy and bouncy in all the right ways. Not overcooked or undercooked like other ramen places. And last, but certainly not least... Their chashu pork is SO GOOD. So tender and juicy... I highly recommend this place for ramen. Sadly, they don't take reservations and the place is always packed. But it's worth the wait in my opinion!
