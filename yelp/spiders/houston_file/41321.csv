Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ahhhhh. Common Bond. I'll make this short and sweet. Parking sucks, as usual. That's ok, because I parked next to Agora and moseyed right over to this place. Probably one of the best vanilla lattes I've had. And chocolate chip cookies. The cookie is big and in the sense that it's not flat, but "fluffy" if you will, and oh so soft. The boyfriend claims there were nuts in it but I can't recall from the couple of bites that I had. Also, get the peanut butter and chocolate cupcake. Just do it. That's all I can say, since this is all I tried this trip. I wonder if/when parking will ever be in abundance in this city....
