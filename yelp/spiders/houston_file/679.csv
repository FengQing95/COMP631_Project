JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is probably the best ramen that I've ever had (though I am no connoisseur). Love taking friends, great environment! Always have to get an order (or 2!) of their Pork Gyoza, and save room (if you can!) for their mochi ice cream. If I lived closer, Jinya would definitely be a once a week treat!
