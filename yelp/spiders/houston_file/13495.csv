JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is always busy! It's hard to get a table here most times but they do have a variety of options. However, I think their best ramen is their vegan ramen. The other ramens are often over complicated and don't taste that amazing. They often have special ramens as well, but in all honesty not my favorite ramen place. I do have to shout out the Japanese curry and their fried Brussel sprouts both of those dishes are fantastic!
