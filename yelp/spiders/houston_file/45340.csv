Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here a couple times and it's always a great experience.  The only issues you'll have here are truly first world problems: 1) everything is so delicious your favorite thing might be sold out if you come late in the day, 2) this place is so good that it is deservedly popular so if you come early you may wait in line.  Solution: come early (with a book) on one day for your favorites, then come later when they're not so busy and chat with the incredibly friendly staff - and learn something new!
