Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Well, we ended up here since the parking lot around Agora Cafe was crowded, so me and my friends decided to go and check this place nearby. The place is nice, but one thing we didn't like that much was that the selection of desserts was scarce - maybe the time we arrived was late for their standards (Saturday around 6:30 pm). Anyhow, the place is nice to hang out with friends and chat, so nice that they even let us stay even 30 minutes after they closed lol. I might come back earlier during the day so I get to check on all the rest of the things everyone mentions on their reviews :D
