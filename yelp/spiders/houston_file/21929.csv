Uchi////First, when I called in to make a reservation for two (birthday date), I was told they don't take reservations for the social hour. Sure enough, when we arrived at opening (5pm), we were told all but one table was reserved (that last table was just taken by a group in front of us). I.e. whoever answered for reservations lied about not taking reservations (call was placed 4/30 at around 6pm the night b4), while there were obviously still tables available to reserve when I called.
