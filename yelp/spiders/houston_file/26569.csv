The Pit Room////Incredible BBQ.  Just really fantastic on the day we went. Pulled pork was PHENOMENAL.  Garlic and onion green beans were amazing, as was mac and cheese. Ribs were great too. Honestly, I wouldn't change anything. We just stumbled into this place from Yelp looking for something to eat besides the overpriced museum-restaurant at the Menil Collection, and so glad we found this. I'd definitely recommend highly, and will come back if I'm ever in the area.
