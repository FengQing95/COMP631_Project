Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great new bakery place. Lines are long, but pretty quick to get through. Huge croissants. One of the better places to get a good piece of almond croissant with a good cup of latte. A lot of good pastries/desserts there, will be back to try. Very unique items on menu that changes from time to time. Friendly staff and nice see-through building concept. Good also that it has some outdoor seating. Watch out for parking though, weekends can be tricky.
