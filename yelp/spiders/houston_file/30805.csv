The Pit Room////Great sides and an awesome one of a kind menu. The ribs were decent. They had huge bones and not a ton of meat which is why i gave them the 4 stars instead of the 5. They have great elote and mac n cheese. I highly recommend stopping here for something to grub. They have a nice setting and you can smell the bbq pit from blocks away.
