Uchi////Just as amazing as I remembered. I had been to the one in Austin a few years ago and it was so good. I had read reviews beforehand that people were having to wait obscene lengths of time to get seated even with a reservation, but we were promptly seated for our 7pm Sunday night reservation. Thank goodness!
