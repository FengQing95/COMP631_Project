Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////YUM. Came here for a brunch date and Bosscat certainly surpassed in their kitchen & libations. We had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Fruity Pebbles French Toast. The Fruity Pebbles French Toast is drizzled with condensed milk, berries, and topped with bacon. Finish off with a carafe of mimosa and you have yourself a meal!
