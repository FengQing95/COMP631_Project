Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////5 stars for AWESOME service! The lovely hostess that took me to my table came back shortly after offering her condolences as I had yet to be greeted, I'd only been there a short time but she introduced herself as the assistant general manager and insisted on getting a pancake out to me while I waited, uuuhm yus pls, it was fluffy & deeeelicious! Ronnie my waitress was super sweet & very helpful with the menu, brought out 4 different hot sauces for me to try! Boasting on the restaurants no high fructose corn syrup rule! I didn't go with her recommendations, & my classic ham benedict was pretty good but nothing mind blowing (this statement does not at all include the pancake...KILLER), so I definitely want to come back & get a better taste of the food! (Listen to your servers guys, she had recommended their interesting chili verdes benedict) but, my point, AAAAHMAZING service! Amanda the manager even came back to ask about my meal and offered me a to-go coffee. Thanks for a lovely breakfast ladies! I'll be back (:
