Kata Robata////Hey now...I don't know if it was the day or what have you, but I was saddened when I had to first off wait a little longer than I'd prefer to get a greeting.  The food was still amazing, but find someone like the waiter I described before because it was as if he was that little seasoning that made the food that much better.  I was so excited to bring my wife here  (as she had never been) and we - like I said - had to wait for someone to finally come over and greet us, then when my wife was asking about things (maybe because I was so impressed with the knowledge the last person had) we got "I don't really know...um it's pretty good...it's all really good".  We weren't even asking how things were - just saying
