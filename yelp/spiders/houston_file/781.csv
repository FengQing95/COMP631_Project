JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback.  When my guests have a bad experience, I take the liberty of replying myself to find out what went wrong and what we can do to improve.  Your review was a bit vague so I'd like to know a little bit more about your visit if possible.  First of all, what did you order?  You stated that the "food tasted horrible" and to date out of 400+ reviews, you're the first to say that so I am curious on what you ordered.  Secondly, we charge for spicy only if your entree is NOT a spicy dish.  For instance, if you ordered Spicy Chicken Ramen, there is no charge for spicy because the entree itself is already spicy.  However, if you ordered say a Tonkotsu Black that doesn't normally come with spice, we do charge a small fee because we are adding additional ingredients to your set entree.  I'm not sure if all peppers are imported and if that really affect the cost, we just have to adhere to the Franchise rules that we are required to follow.  Jinya Ramen Bar is a franchise and thus if we are told to charge for a certain item, every restaurant in the system must follow it.  However, in order to save our guests a few cents, we have placed individual spicy sauce containers on the dining tables so that guests can spice up their ramen themselves.  There is no charge for that and you can add as much as your palate desires.
