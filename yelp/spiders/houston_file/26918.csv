The Pit Room////I had the 3 taco dinner, with pulled chicken, brisket and pulled pork. I returned with my coworkers to get the feast number 1, and both were absolutely mind blowingly fantastic. The people working both times were very kind and happy to explain everything. The meats were fresh, hot, delicious, I could go on forever describing the flavor and perfect balance of spices and sauces. The sides (especially mac and cheese) were also fantastic.
