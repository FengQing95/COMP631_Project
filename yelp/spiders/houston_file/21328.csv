Uchi////Don't get me wrong, it might not have been the best because we order our dishes randomly. I mean we ordered many dishes from scallop rock, unagi nigiri, shag roll, taraba to mikan, yaki niku maki, gyutoro to sakura, walu walu, mustang roll, bacon tataki, hamachi nabe, foie gras nigiri and to finish it with fried milk. The fried milk is awesome, there so different textures and flavors all in one dish. You're suppose to eat a piece of everything on the plate all at one... you won't forget the experience and rave about it to everyone.
