Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's was a regular on the brunch scene.  Nothing would beat rolling in slightly parched from the previous evening's events....to have a personal carafe of water and ultra-leaded coffee at the table.  My favorite order was the Huevos Rancheros sans huevos, extra taters please!  Albeit, likely not the healthiest option....damn those crispy, lightly seasoned breakfast potato cubes were satisfying...then they go and sprinkle some cheese on top, while i mix with those zesty black beans wrapped up into a whole wheat tortilla...and PRESTO......I have returned unscathed from the Land of the Zombies.
