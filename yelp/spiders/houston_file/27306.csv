The Pit Room////The mac n cheese lacked love, it was just made. Nothing special about it and the cheese had no flavor. It was fine for the kids. The potato salad was delish and the hot sauce, I believe its habanero. It was out of this world smack ya in the face with heat and flavor. Yumm I'll take a bottle of that please. My husband got the elote, it too lacked flavor and maybe it was old, or just over cooked, the corn had no crisp to it.
