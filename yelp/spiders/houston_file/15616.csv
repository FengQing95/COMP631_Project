JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////2) Service. I am constantly making staff-policy changes to improve our service, but in this regard I could use your help. Can you provide specific examples of how your service was "bad," or more specifically, how our servers "are almost always mean to you"? Please know this is wholly unacceptable, and a few more specific details from you would help me in the event that I should sanction said server(s) and/or send them on their way.
