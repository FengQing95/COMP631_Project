Baby Barnaby's////Place itself is small but cozy and will have long lines if you get there after 10 am or so. Luckily I'm an early riser so I usually manage to beat the crowd. Service is so friendly here and you can tell by how they greet the regulars that they really care about their customers. Bonus points for letting dogs sit out on the patio. As far as the food itself, it's delicious. I get the green eggs everytime and substitute the toast for their biscuits. Definitely try their biscuits because they're nice and flaky and are sweetened with honey. Eggs+cheese+artichoke is a winning combination and I am a sucker for those square potatoes. My boyfriend gets different things everytime but my favorites have been the waffle, any kind of pancake, and their chicken and waffles. Their waffle batter is magic because it's the best I've had even before adding the butter and syrup - great texture and buttery flavor. Pancakes are giant (portions in general are) and wonderful. Chicken wings were surprisingly crispy and had a subtle heat. I would skip out on the breakfast burrito because it lacked flavor but I am excited to try out the rest of the menu and like I said, be a regular.
