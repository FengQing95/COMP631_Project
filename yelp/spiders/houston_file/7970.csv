JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My fav ramen bar in Houston thus far!  I love the Tonkotsu Black (ask them to make it spicy!).  This is my go to every time I go.  I also love all the tapas items.  I think I have ordered them all at this point! Jinya Bun is yummy, I love the Brussel sprouts, Dynamite is always good, and I don't know why, but asian fried chicken is ALWAYS good!
