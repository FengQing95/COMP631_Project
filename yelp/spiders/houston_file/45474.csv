Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has fallen off. Ordered a super simple cheese plate. The bread was not only stale but hard and not fully cut. We had to tear it to shreds and in the process the bread crushed. The plate was accompanied with less bread than cheese and the cheese was served in slices that looked like they were cut from a wholesale bulk. Blue cheese, and what seemed like two different Brie along with a slather of fig preserves and corn nuts. Not nuts...CORN NUTS!?!?
