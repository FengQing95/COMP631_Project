Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's offers a great balance of good food and a unique ambiance. A lot of this restaurant's treasure lies in the experience - located in the middle of Montrose, being the perfect amount of "run-down", and a friendly amount of glee from the staff - making my visit to this spot more than worth it.
