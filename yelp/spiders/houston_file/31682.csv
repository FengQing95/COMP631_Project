Local Foods////Good grief!! Everything was great! Better than I anticipated! I had the Arugala salad. The salad was great! Shrimp cooked perfect, not too much dressing, and plenty of pecans. My wife had the Crispy chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun. They give you plenty of chicken and the pretzels bun was amazing. It's the best I've ever had. I think the pretzel bun suit the sandwich extremely well.
