Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has a great diner vibe and the food is always tip top. We arrived at 1:55pm (they close at 2:30) and were seated and ordered by 2:10 but it took 40 minutes for the food to come out! Somehow there were bugs everywhere and one landed in my drink and the rest were flying around us the remainder of our meal. Otherwise, our server Darius (?) was great and helpful in making meal choices.
