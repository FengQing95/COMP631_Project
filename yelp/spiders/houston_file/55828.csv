Kata Robata////Went there on a Friday night food was great as well the issue came after I checked my bank statement. Somehow I got overcharged on the transaction. When I let management know about this issues all they said was to hand them my credit card info and they would issue a refund for the amount that was overcharged. I wasn't happy with how my issue was handled but I gave them my information. When I went back to check my bank statement a a full business week after no refund has been issued, I tried calling for the store manager, after exchanging a few emails with him he asked for my credit card info as well and I'm waiting on my refund again.
