Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First of all, EXPECT A WAIT!  We went during the week at about 10a and the wait was about 20 minutes.  Party of two had breakfast tacos, and I had an egg white omelette.  They put TEQUILA IN THEIR MIMOSAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!! They gave us a single pancake of the day on the house while we waited.  I think it was Dos Leches, and it was heaven.  The real heaven was the cinnamon roll pancake I ordered.  I'm pretty sure it was made by Lucifer himself just to raise your blood sugar to 1000 ( yes, I typed one thousand! LOL!).  We're going back again this week!!
