JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall a very good restaurant. My husband and I decided to have a lunch date here since my brother-in-law and his girlfriend are big fans of it. When we arrived to the establishment, we saw numerous people waiting to be seated. However, when we told the hostess that it was was just two people in our party, we were seated right away. I'm guessing that the people waiting were for three or more.
