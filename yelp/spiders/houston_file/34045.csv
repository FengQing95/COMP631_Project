Local Foods////My boyfriend ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich which is also on a pretzel bun.  Hmm...we couldn't figure out why it is called crunchy because the chicken is not crunchy...maybe it's the pretzel bun that is supposed to be crunchy?? Either way, he enjoyed the sandwich overall mostly because of the pretzel bun, but he wasn't too keen on the chicken.  He said he would have preferred the chicken grilled to add more flavor and texture to it.  For the sides he ordered the cucumber and the housemade potato chips.  The cucumber side was okay and the chips had a good crunch.
