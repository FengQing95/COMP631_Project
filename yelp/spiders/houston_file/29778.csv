The Pit Room////I got the 2 meat dinner option which includes a choice of 2 meats (except for beef ribs), 2 sides, and bread. I chose pork ribs and pulled pork. There was a good amount of pulled pork and I got 3 ribs with my order. The pulled pork was smoky and flavorful. The ribs were a tad burnt but delicious. I chose elote and macaroni and cheese for my sides. The elote was a pleasant but fiery surprise. I got my elote with "everything" on top (some sort of crema, hot sauce over the corn). If you are not great with spicy food I would get the elote by itself without the spicy sauce.
