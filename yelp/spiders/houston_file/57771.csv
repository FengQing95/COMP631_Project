Kata Robata////We came here to celebrate a birthday, and we had a great time.  Our server Khan was fantastic and provided great recommendations.  We arrived just before the happy hour pricing was ending, and Khan made sure that we got in some orders.  He also make fantastic recommendations about which food items to try and in which order (like don't get the lobster mac and cheese until the end because it is much heavier food than the sashimi and sushi offerings).  We had two of their signature sushi rolls and both were unique - one even had a truffle vinaigrette on it.
