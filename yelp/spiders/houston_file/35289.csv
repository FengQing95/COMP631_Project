Local Foods////Really enjoyed our experience here. Friendly staff, cute seating options, and great local and healthy options. I've been trying to get my parents to venture out a little with food choices, adding more veggies, grains, legumes. This place had great options, and my parents really enjoyed their meals. Win win!!!
