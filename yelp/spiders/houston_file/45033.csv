Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The first word that comes to mind is that everything was WONDERFUL.  Pastries were great (not super sweet like most bakeries nowadays) and their coffee has character. When I mean character, they draw items as requested in the counter when you order.  I first ordered a dragon but the guy that does it was out (hehe), the swan was beautifully done and was my second choice.  This place is quaint and i'll definitely put this in my list next time I visit Houston.
