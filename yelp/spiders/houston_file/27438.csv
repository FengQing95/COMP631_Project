The Pit Room////Was first in line yesterday, 11/30/2020, ordered 1 lb sliced brisket.  Half lean/half moist (fatty) to go.  The cutter (I think he is one of the owners) laid out one piece of flat and one piece of point.  The edges looked a little off color.  He started slicing really thin slices off each piece.  I didn't think much of it at the time because this place was highly recommended & had been on the Texas Monthly top 50 list.  It was still warm when I got home & gave it a taste.  The pieces of the flat (lean)  were dry and chewy.  The slices of point (fatty, moist) were tough and chewy.  Had I eaten there, I would have asked for a refund.  If Daniel Vaughn had been served what I got, they would NEVER have made the top 50 list.  The two beef sausages I ordered & received are a whole other story.  Took a few bites and got an upset stomach, then threw them in the trash (along with the rest of the brisket).  They smelled so funky in the kitchen trash, I had to take the bag out to the outside garbage can.  $33.00 down the drain. Would not expect such from a top rated bbq joint.  I will NOT go back.
