Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was great. We didn't have a reservation but we're seated pretty quickly. However, we weren't big fans of the drinks. I believe it's because Â we're not big whiskey drinkers. I would wish for a variety of drinks like one or two. Other than that, we still enjoyed our food. Service was also great!
