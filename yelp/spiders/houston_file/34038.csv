Local Foods////I love Local Foods.  They offer innovative sandwiches, salads, sides, and soups that are usually healthy and tasty.  My personal favorite is the smoked salmon.  This spot is more expensive than most sandwich spots, but you do get what you pay for.  One nice thing Local Foods offers is a lot of gluten and dairy-free options.
