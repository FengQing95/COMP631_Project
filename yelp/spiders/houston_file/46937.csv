Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////However, the service was TERRIBLE. We knew that the wait was going to be an hour or so, and patiently ordered from the bar while we waited. They sat down several parties that arrived after us; we were a large group (6) and they were sitting parties of 2 people in booths that were supposed to be for 4 minimum. It looked very unorganized, the way they handled the wait time and the sitting arrangement, but, we were still not complaining at this time.
