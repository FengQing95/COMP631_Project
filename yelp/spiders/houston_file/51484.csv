Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Comes with hash browns: this arrived in a molded cylinder of hash. It's compacted down so that the consistency is more like a rice cake. All the grease is held in by the shape. It's thick and cakey and was definitely not a good experience. Only thing I couldn't finish - much too heavy.
