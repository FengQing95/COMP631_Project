JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Your description of our Cha Cha Cha ramen bowl was quite surprising to read, as it was not in line with what we usually hear about this particular dish. On the off-chance that our chefs made a mistake in preparation, I always encourage our guests to let their server know they are not happy with their meal. We will always gladly remake your dish or offer you another option. We want nothing more than for all of our customers to leave happy.
