The Pit Room////I've been to half a dozen places in Houston trying to find good barbecue. You don't need to look at any further. This place has the best selection of meats and unique and authentic sides. The smoke flavor comes through pronounced and the meat is always juicy and flavorful. Not to mention they have the patio bar right around the corner for inexpensive drinks. This is high end, one of a kind Q at a very reasonable price. And do t forget to visit their killer condiment bar for all kinds of FREE pickled veggies. Â Love eating here and would everyday if it were possible. This may be my first 5 review and they deserve it!
