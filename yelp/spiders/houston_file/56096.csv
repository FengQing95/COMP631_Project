Kata Robata////The service here is nothing to write home about, but that doesn't mean they're bad.  They get the job done with no issues and that's how I like it.  It's good to note that their competitor (Uchi) actually wants their service staff get right in your face with the sushi connoisseur attitude, but I'm not a big fan of that.  I know some people actually would prefer this, but to each their own.
