Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I usually get the pancakes but I decided to get the Benedict duo this time and OMG so good! I got the avocado smash and the habanero pork belly. Both were amazing but the habanero pork belly was out of this world good. Out of all the plates on the table, absolutely nothing looked short of amazing. We also tried pineapple, orange and grapefruit mimosas. All great! I was sad they do not sell carafes though :(
