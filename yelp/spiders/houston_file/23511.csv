Uchi////We had dinner the other night at Uchi and it was by far one of the best meals and service I've had in a very long time. We sat at the sushi bar, and although very busy, the service did not slack in the slightest. We had multiple pieces of akami and hamachi. We also had the marinated tuna (forget the name), the Japanese uni and the spicy crunchy tuna roll. Everything was absolutely delicious and so very fresh. We ended the night with the kinoko nabe. The flavors were so well balanced. If you want unique flavors and great service, Uchi should definitely be the top of your list.
