JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't usually like ramen places for a host of reasons, but I had to give this place a try because it came highly recommended from more than one person. I ended up ordering the "Slurp Up Cilantro," which was better than most ramen I've tried that is not homemade. The broth and the toppings were on the lighter side, so it tasted healthier than most ramen I've had.
