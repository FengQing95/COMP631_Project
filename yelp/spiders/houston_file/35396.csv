Local Foods////The absolute 180 this place took! I loved it before but I'm so very impressed with the new remodeling. I love the atmosphere AND the wine shop on the second floor! The food was lovely and I couldn't complain. The new set up easily resolved the previous issues with lack of seating and long lines. I'm very happy this change has been made. The outdoor patio is also just so inviting.
