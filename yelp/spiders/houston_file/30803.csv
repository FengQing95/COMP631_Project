The Pit Room////I ordered the brisket with potato salad and elote. I was so surprised at the taste of the elote, it was savory goodness. The potato salad was decent as well. The brisket literally melts in your mouth, is juicy and not dry. The BBQ sauce is more on the sour tangy side, I was expecting more sweet, which is how I prefer it. I also got a lemonade to go with my meal, it was great to have to wash down all this wonderful food.
