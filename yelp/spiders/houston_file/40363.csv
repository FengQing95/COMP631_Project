Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Atmosphere 4/5: Very beautiful restaurant in the heart of the Westheimer strip. It is decorated very nicely and has a decent amount of seating. The table inside vary from regular tables to high tops, and you also have the option of sitting on the patio when the weather is nice!
