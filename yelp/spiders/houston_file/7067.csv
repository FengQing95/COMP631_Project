JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is AMAZING. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen EXTRA spicy and it did not disappoint. The takoyaki were soooo delicious and the potstickers tasted like high grade pork knowwhatimsaying? I would definitely come here again. Only downside is that I had to valet to park, but hey thats midtown life tho.
