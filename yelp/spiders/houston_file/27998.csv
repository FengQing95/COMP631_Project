The Pit Room////I ordered 3 meat dinner coz I really like to try everything. I had ordered the brisket, pork ribs( they told me beef ribs are not included in 3 meat dinner) and venison sausage.  The brisket- sure it's really tender.  The pork ribs were pretty good but a lit bit too skinny- I can't find too much meat. The sausage were the best.  I also have the cold slaw, mac and cheese as my sides. The mac and cheese was pretty different than the ones I use to have. The cheese was melting and it's tasty.
