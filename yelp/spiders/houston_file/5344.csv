JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the gyoza which was pretty good, it was small but flavorful and warm. Now on to the main dish the ramen! It is easily the best I've had here in town. The ramen was cooked well, the pork was tender with a good amount of fat but was a little bit cold even after submerging it in the broth. My soft boiled egg was cooked perfect and biting into it while drinking the broth made me shed a tear how flavorful it all was.
