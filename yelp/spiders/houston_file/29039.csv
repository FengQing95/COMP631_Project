The Pit Room////Fantastic Texas BBQ. 16 hour slow wood smoked. Enjoyed the 3 meat dinner. Brisket (a little dry but still good), jalape√±o cheddar sausage and pork rib with side of beans okra and mac n cheese. The pork ribs are so good( some of the best I've ever had). Next time I'm going all ribs Mac n cheese , Okra and beans. Delicious!!!
