Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have to say, that there are latte is are pretty deli! Â I have only tried so far they are plain latte, not only with regular milk but also with almond milk and they are both pretty good. The only pastry that I have tried there it's the pistachio croissant and the chocolate croissants which are very delicious too my husband tried the salad with the beats and he was amazed by it I love the fact that the water containers are not reusable cups so you can take the water with you!! Every time I get to go around the area I definitely hit this place.
