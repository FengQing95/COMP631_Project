Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We've been to Common Bond multiple times for their baked goods and always enjoy them! We've also had dinner here a time or two, which was also yummy albeit a bit pricey for a small cafe. The triple chocolate brown butter cookie we tried yesterday was hands down one of the best cookies I've had. It was served warm, so the chocolate was all melty and delicious - ugh, amazing. We also really enjoy their macarons, although the mango passion was a miss IMO. Also yesterday we happened to walk in during happy hour and tried their $3 lavender mimosas, which were light and refreshing! One recommendation, though: continue to swirl the drink throughout consumption otherwise you'll end up with a mouthful of lavender flavoring at the end. Give this cute cafe a try! I know we will continue to stop by for tasty treats!
