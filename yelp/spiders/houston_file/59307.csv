Baby Barnaby's////Some other things I like about the restaurant is that they give full pitchers of water for each table. It saves time, and is easy for both the customer and the waiter. They also have fresh orange juice that they juice right there on the spot. Though I wish that it would be served slightly cooler, it's the first thing I order on the spot.
