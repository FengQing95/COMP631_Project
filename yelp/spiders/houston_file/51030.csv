Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Strike #2: After being seated, we ordered immediately with our server. We did not want to waste a second longer because we were both famished. When the food came out, imagine how annoyed and disappointed we were to receive garbage. Everything was COLD. Not room temperature, but cold. I ordered the Benny Duo w/ steak+eggs and the Benny Goodman (lox style salmon and cream cheese) with a side of bacon. I never received the house hash brown that came with this dish (see picture). I was told by the runner that it would come out shortly and it never did. The hash brown that sits under the Benny Goodman was stale and undercooked. The steak was rubbery and overcooked. The side of bacon was cold and 90% fat. Have you ever eaten cold fat? It's disgusting. I sampled my boyfriend's Shrimp and Grits, and it was not bad. The flavor was there, but again it was cold. If it was hot, it would have been a yes from me. I asked him if he liked it, and he said that he was too hungry to tell. Bless his heart.
