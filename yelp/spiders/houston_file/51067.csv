Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The manager point blank and blatantly LIED TO MY FACE that the pancakes they served me were the right size. I knew good and gotdamn well they'd shrunk smaller than ever this time. I even pulled up PICS of pancakes I'd been served just last weekend that I'd posted on Instagram, and this dude had the audacity to lie AGAIN and say "I don't know who made those, but they put too much batter." He then said, "This is the right size, so I will have a word with the chefs to make sure they're using this amount of batter going forward."
