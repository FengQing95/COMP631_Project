JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Disclaimer: I never come here for dinner. Parking is horrendous around this part of Midtown after work hours, and the wait times can get pretty lengthy as the restaurant isn't terribly large. If it's your first time here, I recommend stopping by during lunch hours, as you'll snag a seat pretty easily.
