Uchi////You can make reservations a month in advance. Â You can also try coming in right at 5 when they open or get your hotel concierge to get you a last minute reservation. The last time I came to Houston, I ate here two nights in a row and the second night actually waited 2 hours for a table...something I NEVER do.
