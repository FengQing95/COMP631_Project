JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: good. For spicy lovers, definitely go with the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, spicy level hot. If you order anything else, definitely ask for thick noodles if the ramen doesn't come with it. I swear you won't regret it. For appetizers, I recommend the Crispy Chicken Wings. If you're tempted to order the Pork Gyoza, I'd say skip it: it's not enough for the price.
