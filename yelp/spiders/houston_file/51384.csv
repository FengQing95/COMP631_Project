Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Winter Harvest Benny which is poached eggs and vegetables over grit cakes with Hollandaise sauce. The grit cakes were small, hence the quantity comment but the taste mixed well when you throw everything together including the hash brown. I didn't have to reach for the hot sauce.
