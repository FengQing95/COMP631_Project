Uchi////Cobia kinoko -black kingfish, asian pear, morel, hon shimeji, basil. My favorite dish of the night. The fish was buttery and melted in your mouth. The mushrooms and pear complemented it so well. They candied the basil and it added a very nice texture along with the pop of basil flavor. yummm.
