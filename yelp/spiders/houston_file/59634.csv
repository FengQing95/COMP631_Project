Baby Barnaby's////I drew a 6th star on my phone and tapped on it so I could leave this establishment a 6 star review! I go to this place on the regular. I drop in once or twice a month for breakfast. It's one of one restaurants where I haven't gotten the same thing twice. What I order is always so good, it leaves me wondering what else I missed out on by not ordering the next item down! I had the apple pecan pancake on my last visit. NEVER have I had a pancake that made me want to kidnap the kitchen staff and take them home with me. I highly recommend the place for anybody who has Google searches "best breakfast in Houston", just save yourself the typing and get yourself in their door!
