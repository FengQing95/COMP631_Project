The Pit Room////The brisket and the bbq sauce was good. The brisket was perfectly seasoned and the meat was tender and flavorful. But the ice cream sandwich was frozen solid and flavorless. It was basically impossible to eat. After waiting for it to melt, the entire sandwich just became soggy. Would not recommend.
