Local Foods////I was looking for a filling but yet healthy salad, and I found this place! I was hesitant about parking because it's in Rice Village, but they have their own parking lot and plenty to f space. Note they do share it with 2 other restaurants. I was greeted by friendly staff who explained the menu in detail since it was my first time. I had a tuna salad which was delicious! Granted it was $16 but it was worth it.
