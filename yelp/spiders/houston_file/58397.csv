Baby Barnaby's////This place has my heart. I've come to this location with my dad since a very young age. It's always busy but we always end up in that great booth on the right side of the door which we like! The same amazing lady has served us and is so happy to see us every time we come in. She does photography on the side and has been working there for atleast 10 years.
