JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Aaron - Thank you for your review. We appreciate the positive rating, and your candid remarks about the other ramen establishments you have tried. Though I must respectfully disagree with your assessment regarding the "vibe" of our establishment. We are a group of 50-60 employees who work hard to create and provide a quality product with excellent service. That is our essential goal. We don't always hit the mark, and we try to learn from our mistakes. But we believe authentic Japanese ramen is for people of all stripes, and having set up shop in Houston nearly five years ago, we have served thousands of guests that would largely defy your description of a "dirty fat boy snack." Again, I say this with respect and admiration since you did not pan us in your review and even stated that you would have given us an additional half-star if given the chance. Thank you again.
