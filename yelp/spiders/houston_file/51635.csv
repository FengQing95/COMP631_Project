Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service here is very hit or miss. We've had a fantastic waiter here who went above and beyond. We've also had one of the worst waiters I've had of any service experience this location. He spilled coffee creamer on our table and didn't clean it up, forgot to bring out the sauce that typically comes with our meals, and didn't bring us utensils.
