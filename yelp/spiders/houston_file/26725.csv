The Pit Room////After reading all of the reviews about how good this place was I thought I'd give it a try. The bbq was average in my opinion. I think what makes this place so talked up is just the concept and the location of the restaurant. The was good by all means, but overrated. I ordered the 2 meat dinner (sausage and beef) with 2 sides. It was reasonably priced.
