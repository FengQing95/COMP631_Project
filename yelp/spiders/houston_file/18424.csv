Uchi////The restaurant has a very unique style that is industrial and unique. At most vantage points you can view the chefs preparing the dishes. The Brussels sprout appetizer is out of this world. By far the best way I have ever had Brussels sprouts. We also had the octopus, oysters, and mushroom sushi roll. The walu walu was also delicious in flavor and depth. The service was awesome. Each dish presented came with an explanation and the best way to eat the dish. The lemon sorbet was also fantastic. Why not five stars you ask? Some of the dishes were not to our Â liking but not to say it may taste delish to someone else.
