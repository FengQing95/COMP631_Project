Uchi////While waiting forever for each plate to come as slowly as possible we told the waiter we are going to the restroom really quick and will be right back. Came back literally 2 minutes later with our food and drinks gone. Waiter came back about 5 minutes later and told us sorry it was a mistake his exact words "I knew you were stepping away for a second it was the vato that cleaned it up" racist much??? Anyways he told us he will bring us back the food we did not finish which he never did. That's besides the point though. I was over it and did not want to try anything anymore.
