Baby Barnaby's////This is the go-to place when I recommend brunch to someone. Even if it's unsolicited. This is the kind of place that you talk about whenever it pops into your mind. It has the same great breakfast as their other locations (green eggs and ham, huevos rancheros, fresh squeezed orange juice, etc etc) PLUS migas, pink and white scramble, and beef and potato hash.
