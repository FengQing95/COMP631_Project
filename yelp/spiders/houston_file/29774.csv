The Pit Room////Got the 3 meat dinner with brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork. The brisket was definitely my favorite of the 3 meats. So juicy, tender and literally falling apart. The pork ribs were a tad dry, but had good flavor. The pulled pork was also tender and went really well with the pickles and pickled onions. Definitely want to return to try their sausage and chicken!
