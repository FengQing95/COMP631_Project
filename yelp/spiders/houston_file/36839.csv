Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////To be honest, I'm super confused why this place has great reviews. The staff and all the people that work here are great and very very nice. BUT - the food so extremely extremely bad. Almost gross, we got the steak and eggs (extremely rancid smelling and the steak couldn't be called steak). The Sandwich was extremely bad mainly just a hunk of ham. The tator tots dish was mediocre it was basically Sonic. I'm disappointed that this place has been very very unrealistically hyped. Extreme waste of money and time.
