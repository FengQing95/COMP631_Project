Kata Robata////Long time patron. Overall great food quality and great inventive sushi. Ocean trout is amazing when available as well as kinmadai etc.  Food is top notch but decor is a bit lacking and I think makes West U crowd feel like it's ok to wear jeans shorts to such an otherwise great spot!  One final complaint, and one that many others agree with me on - the Host/Hostess staff are clueless!!!!  They always are difficult to communicate with and can never give a straight answer. So so irritating.  I would come here more often but it's so easy to pivot to Uchi. Regardless which one has a longer wait the Host stand there is so much more professional.
