The Pit Room////Overall the briskets and pork ribs were good.  The briskets have the right amount of fat and meat ratio and the ribs were tender falling off of the bones.  I had a bite of the sausage and tried to eat a couple more pieces by picking out the jalapeños but still too spicy for me so unfortunately I had to give up on them.  The grilled green beans were a tad too overlooked so its wilted and soggy.  I never thought I will say that but the white bread they gave you with the meal was really good.  I don't know what it is but I was tempted to ask for a second piece as it really helped with the grease and cut down the strong flavoring of the meats.
