Uchi////Very unhappy. I have been here prior to Covid and it's sad to say the service has gone done substantially. If you're running late - they'll give you a hard time. But what is ironic is that when you call them to discuss the situation, you'll be on hold and then be sent to voice-mail. So why even bother asking for the call ahead? Not only that, let's be real, if we're going to Uchi, we're not penny pinchers. We're spending quite a bit, so why not be more understanding? And to make matters worse, when we had difficulty paying using the QR code on the bill, the waitress was condescending. We're millennials, we know how to use a smartphone, but technology isn't always perfect. We won't be returning. Poor service and understanding when we're spending $$$. Pass. Hard pass. Uchi, you're Â a let down.
