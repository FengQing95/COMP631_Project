Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had misplaced my $25 Common Bond gift card long ago but then it surfaced.  Thrilled, I placed a large to-go order for pick up.  When I arrived and presented the card for pymt, the cashier claimed the card had physically changed and was no longer valid.  When I showed him the physical CC receipt of the gift card purchase, he discussed the situation with the shift mgr who informed me the card could not be honored.  I paid the pick-up tab with cash and informed both workers I would tell my tale on social media and to Johnny Carrabba if I could catch him at his Kirby location.   Really disappointed in Common Bond on Westheimer, as I have been a customer since its opening.  Being a Carrabba's owned restaurant I'm surprised Common Bond hasn't adopted the Customer Svc culture so prevalent across the Carrabba's restaurant empire.  Sadly, I'll not be returning to C.B. and will share my experience across media land.  Oh, btw, the new menu item, Turkey Burger was dry and flavorless.  I had requested dressing on the side for 2 sandwiches and unfortunately they screwed up that request.  What a cluster tonight at C.B.!  Help me Johnny C!
