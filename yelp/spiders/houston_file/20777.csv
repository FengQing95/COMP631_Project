Uchi////I've gone to Uchi about a dozen time in Austin, but this was my first time in Houston. Uchi is the perfect place for a sushi date with your bae. The place has swag, very nice decor from inside to outside. I highly recommend making a reservation online before you go to avoid long waits. As soon as we arrived we were seated!!
