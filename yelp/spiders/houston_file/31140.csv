Local Foods////Love this place. Every time I come to Houston I have to come to this place to try something else on the menu. Last time I had the crunchy chicken sandwich, which is their staple and never disappoints, but this time I was feeling a salad so I tried the Asian chopped chicken salad. Amazing. Probably the best Asian salad I've had in a long time. Loved the crunchy toasted cashews, cabbage had a nice crunch, and the dressing wasn't overpowering. Chicken was really well seasoned. And a very hearty-sized portion. I'll be back for more the next time I come down here!
