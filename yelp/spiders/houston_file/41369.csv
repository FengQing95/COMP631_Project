Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has become one of the most beloved bakeries in Houston. They do everything well. For a weekday breakfast, they offer a wonderful soft scramble. Perfectly cooked eggs, topped with warm vegetables, served with toast and homemade jam. The coffee is spot on. The weekend wait is worth the time. We enjoyed the chocolate croissant, fruit toast, and yogurt parfait. Again, don't forget the coffee. Common Bond also offers an extensive macaroon selection, but the pastries and loaves of bread are the way to go.
