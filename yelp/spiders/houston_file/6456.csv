JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Bill was er.. padded a bit as halfway thru the meal waitress brought a plate with 2 very thin slices of pork (60% just fat) we didn't order 'extra pork', and was charged extra, then on top of this Â was also charged for 'spicy'. Seemed a little petty for a dash of spiracha.
