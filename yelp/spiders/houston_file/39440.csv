Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I looked at him and asked for the check (one friend managed to order a beer). Yes I'm female, but I do enjoy whiskey and own over 100 bottles myself and know the differences between bourbon, rye, high ryes, scotch, single malts, single grain, blended, whiskey vs whisky, etc. We Left and none of us have been back 8 months later. Food is subpar and since their initial opening (yes i was there on your opening day) prices have continually increased for very average $20-$30 bottles of bourbon in particular. I'm actually offended by how much they have marked up the prices- they are essentially robbing you. Liked this place initially and went often but after the most recent visit, it will always be a hard pass.
