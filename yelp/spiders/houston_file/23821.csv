Uchi////Great for omakase deal! Sushi was really fresh and good quality. The service was also excellent! Very attentive staff. The only reason for one star got taken off on this review is the ambience was too loud and the restaurant was over cramped up with customers. Also, despite having a reservation but we were not seated until more than half of the party presented. Therefore, while waiting for friends to arrive, we all had to stand around at the bar area for drinks, and we constantly got bumped into by waitstaff and other customers.
