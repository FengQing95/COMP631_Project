The Pit Room////Pit Room has decent everything that we tried - brisket, beef rib, sausage, and pork ribs.  They do the beef rib pretty well, but it's not as good as Hometown in NYC or La BBQ in Austin.  Same goes with the pork ribs.  The side of Mac and cheese are among the best we've had at BBQ places.  Their beans are good, but not as good as say Fette Sau in NYC.
