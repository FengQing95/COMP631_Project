Uchi////It's no secret: Uchi is the best japanese and sushi restaurant in Houston! Â Service is always top notch and the food is nothing short of spectacular, but be ready to open up those wallets as it can quickly get pricey. I pretty much find the entire menu delicious so order what you can afford
