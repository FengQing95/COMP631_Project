Uchi////Uchi dishes are purely that good. Yelp has it listed as 4 dollar signs and I'll confirm that it's accurate. If you're looking to have a nice night out and would like to indulge a bit, put Uchi up to the plate. My only concern, as others, was the wait. My beau tried to make rezzies in advance but was told that they wouldn't be taking any because they try to save more of the dining room space to accommodate walk-ins. Initially, I thought that was nice of them. However, as "walk-ins" we still waited a solid hour and fifteen only to be left seated at the sushi bar and not our own table. After the first 40min we were asked by our very kind maitre d if we would like to be seated at the 'community table'. Sounds festive and we would have on any normal day but for this particular day we wanted some space to ourselves. I love that the Uchi staff stayed courteous and attentive throughout our dinner. I really appreciate good service in the front of the house.
