Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For starters the food was really disgusting the drinks are really nice James was a really nice manager he took care of us and listen to our concerns.....We had a Cajun brick chicken that had no flavor what's so ever....shrimp and grits was really spicy!!....the atmosphere was really nice and friendly the employees are super friendly and helpful it's just the food that killed it for us. Hopefully next time we come back it is way better
