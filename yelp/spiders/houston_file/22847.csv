Uchi////First, upon entering the refurbished home turned contemporary restaurant, my guest and I were warmly greeted. The host let us know our wait time and after much consideration, we waited outside for approximately 30 minutes. The other host continuously came by to fill our glasses with Uchi's own filtered water. Turns out, the filtered water dramatically increases the taste and texture of the rice so I can get down with that. As we were waiting, we decided to scope through the menu so that we will be able to place our order upon being seated. Some may know, when vegan, it takes time to sort through the types of foods you desire to eat.
