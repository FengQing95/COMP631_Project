JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Amazing service, delicious food, great atmosphere! Everything is fresh to order, sometimes I have to wait cause the noodles are too hot to eat! Very fast, even during the lunch rush (which by the way you have to get there early if you just want a chance at a seat), and overall awesome people who always have a friendly smile.
