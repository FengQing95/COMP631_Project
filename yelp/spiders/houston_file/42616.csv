Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Really trendy, great ambiance.  Good sweets and pastries.  I'm not a fan of coffee so I cannot attest to the quality- this is a great place to take out of town guests and if you like trendy places.  The wait can be long, come early.  The almond croissant is good but I have had better in Houston at Croissant Brioche.
