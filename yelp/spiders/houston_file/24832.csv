Uchi////I come to uchi at least once a year for the last 3 years to splurge and treat myself. This place practically never disappoints. Currently, they have hand sanitizer at the entrance when you walk in and all of the employees wear masks. We made reservations for 2 and were seated as soon as arrived. We always order the omakase, which is always an awesome surprise since the chef picks everything we eat. There's a few misses with some dishes, but definitely the majority are hits! I absolutely always enjoy all of the nigiri pieces they prepare and the wait staff is very friendly and always gives you recommendations on how to eat/when to eat. They also really try hard to make everything and enjoyable experience. We made one complaint that the wagyu dish was too salty, and they happily replaced the dish with a less saltier wagyu which was excellent. It's always a fun surprise eating here and I definitely plan on coming back again for omakase only. Well worth the bill which usually ends up greater than $200 and we are always full after experiencing all of these dishes.
