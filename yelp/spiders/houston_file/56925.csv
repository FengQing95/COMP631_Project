Kata Robata////It's elegant, it's loud, it's expensive. But, oh, it's so d--- good! The grilled eggplant and rice gets me every time, as does the Kobe beef. I usually order the yellowtail and tuna sashimi, a roll or two, and definitely check out the specials. Pre-COVID, this place was  a Scene. Now, I order for delivery -- and the quality remains.  And I content myself with the knowledge that, after COVID, I'm taking the platinum card and ordering omakase.
