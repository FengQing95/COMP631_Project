Local Foods////What excited me a little bit more about this place was the full bar featuring Texas-raised spirits, though I did not partake.  Local Foods has introduced me to several Texas-raised spirits that I otherwise may never have known of for years since I live in California.  Awesome!  Can I take it all back with me to Los Angeles?
