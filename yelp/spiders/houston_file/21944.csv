Uchi////The fish was so fresh!  The Hama chili, walu walu, uchiviche and hot rock scallops were all amazing.  If you are not a brussels sprout fan, uchi will definitely change your mind. The hot rock scallops and sprouts were my favorite. We mixed it up and got the pitchfork roll (beef) to add some nonseafood and uchi nailed that as well.
