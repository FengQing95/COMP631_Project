Uchi////I loved this restaurant!  My favorite during our trip to Houston.  I was so glad friends recommended this restaurant to us.  We were a party of 4 and our dinner was spectacular.  The service, the ambience... just perfect.  We arrived on time for our 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night and were seated right away.  (Definitely make a reservation, as the restaurant was packed!)
