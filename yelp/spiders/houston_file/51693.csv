Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The shrimp and grits had a great flavor. They used ground sausage which was something new but it was really good. I def would try again. The French toast was very rich! Definitely glad I got a half plate. The pineapple upside down cake was amazing but we definitely recommend getting a half plate unless you're sharing!
