Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can only comment on the bakery side of common bond but to me that's enough, great desserts, they had a blueberry peach fritter that is amazing. when they first opened they had a standard eclair with cream and what i think was a bittersweet chocolate glaze on top, i never saw them again and I still think about them. now I see the ones that look more like sandwiches then a standard piped eclair, I would love to see the old ones every so often. Great bakery.
