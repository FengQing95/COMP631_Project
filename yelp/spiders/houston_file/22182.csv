Uchi////First off, food was highly overrated. Crunchy spicy tuna roll tasted the same as the ones you get from Whole Foods. Ok, that may be an exaggeration but wanted to get my point across. First off, the highlights would have to be the wagyu on hot rock, and the karage chicken. The baby yellowtail was also good. Did not like the ham and eggs, brussel sprouts, or anything else that we ordered. And we ordered A LOT. Spent $300 and left very unsatisfied in the quality of food and service (Dallas Uchi surpasses this location in both respects).
