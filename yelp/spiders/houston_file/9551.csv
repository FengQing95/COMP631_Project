JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachal - Thank you very much for the great review. We appreciate your kind words and descriptions of our restaurant. As far as pricing is concerned, we do feel our rates are commensurate with most eateries in Midtown, which is by far one of the more expensive areas of Houston. Nevertheless, we appreciate your coming through and we hope to serve you again soon.
