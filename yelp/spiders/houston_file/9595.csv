JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the main course, I cannot order anything other than the Tonkotsu Black bowl ( hope my spelling is correct) with the pork belly. I love the egg! I assume its sous vide in soy sauce before added to the bowl. The ambiance is amazing, feel is cozy, although sometimes it can be slightly crowded, oh and hot sake on tap! Jinya is definitely a must visit!
