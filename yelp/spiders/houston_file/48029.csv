Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of, if not the best, brunch spots in Houston. The food looks and tastes great and the atmosphere is dope. The Ham Benedict is one of my faves. It does get pretty busy and depending on the day or time, you could be waiting an hour to get seated. But once in your seat, the wait time for your food is pretty decent and it is worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
