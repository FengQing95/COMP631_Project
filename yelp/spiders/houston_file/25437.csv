Uchi////I've been a regular to uchi for a while now pretty much going once a week. The atmosphere and food is amazing and real unique find here in Houston. I love bringing in my friends and family and they always love it too. They have an amazing happy hour (social hour) to check out with lots of food and great drinks on there. Uchi also offers an amazing vegetarian menu that is available on the regular and social hour menu. All of the servers are amazing especially my girl E-vy! She's been so helpful since day one and is very kind and knowledgeable of the menu. Thank you so much for everything!
