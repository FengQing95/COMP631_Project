Uchi////The price may seem a bit steep to some people, but to foodies looking for an experience, Uchi delivers. As someone who goes to Uchi once a month, I am in a gray area for being a regular. Nevertheless, the staff always seems to remember me and treat me like I go there once a day, From what I can tell, it seems that most of the other people are receiving excellent service as well (so I guess its not just my award winning personality).
