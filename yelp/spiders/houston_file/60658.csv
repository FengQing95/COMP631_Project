Baby Barnaby's////The steak was a bit too salty, and typically could be found at other diners such as waffle house. The eggs were made with artichoke and spinach, it was good, creamy, and buttery. The fruit were fresh and plentiful. The jam/jelly were of good quality if anyone wanted to know. My favorite part was the biscuits, they were a bit sweet, buttery, crunch on the outside, and soft on the inside.
