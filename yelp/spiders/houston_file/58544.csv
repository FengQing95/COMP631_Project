Baby Barnaby's////Fast forward to 30 minutes later. We're relieved that we got there when we did because now there are 15 to 20 people outside who signed in after us, and God only knows how long they'll be waiting for a table. (When we left, there were still people outside who got there before we were even seated.) When we get inside we see friends of ours we haven't seen in too long at a table near ours, so we set our things down at our table and then exchange a few hugs and hellos. We're literally 5 feet away from our table, and have been standing for not even 30 seconds, and a server comes by to take a chair away from our table. My friend asked him to leave it, as we needed it to put our coats and purses on (3 women in 30 degree weather- we all had sweaters, scarves and coats to take off before we could eat, as well as our purses, and there's no way they were all going to fit under the tiny table). But the server insisted, even though there were empty chairs scattered about the room. My friend pleaded with him two more times, and the server still insisted and eventually stopped listening to her and left. So we spent the next minute or so trying to figure out what the heck we were going to to with all our stuff. Purses ended up under our feet, coats and sweaters on the backs of the chairs (inhibiting the walking space, which was extremely limited anyhow), and I kept my scarf on. Humpf.
