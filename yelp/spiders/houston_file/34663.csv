Local Foods////So I placed my order online and the website took forever to load. This order needed to be tax exempt and usually there is a place for "special instructions" where I enter our tax exempt number. The online system for Local Foods doesn't allow this, I thought no big deal they can reimburse my card when I get there. The system they use doesn't allow reimbursement so the manager, who btw was very nice, reimbursement the tax in cash. The cash reimbursement is more of a headache for me to deal with than just getting the credit card used reimbursed the dollar and change.
