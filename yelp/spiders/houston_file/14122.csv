JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's almost a draw between this place and Tiger den. But ofc here you don't have the dipping noodles as an option. I've never got into the ramen craze like everyone has in the past recent years. So I was really hesitate when my friends decided they want to try ramen during their visit here.
