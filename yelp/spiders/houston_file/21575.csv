Uchi////Something that needs to be pointed out is that this place has fantastic service.  They really go out of their way for the customer, and that isn't something you see a lot in many restaurants.  The guy next to us realized he ordered the wrong dish when it arrived and within 5 seconds, the waiter said with a smile, "don't worry about it, it's on us."  In the past, when we've debated between a few desserts, the ones we didn't choose were brought out to us for free so we could try them.  One time, towards the end of our meal, they brought us a wagyu beef dish, "just 'cause."  Plates are always quickly cleared, and drinks are always full.  Kudos to Uchi and the service team!  They are one of the many reasons why I continue to return.
