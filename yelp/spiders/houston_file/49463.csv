Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the Chiquilles Benedict. Tasty brisket, fresh pico de gallo, homemade sopas replaced the English muffin. Great chef skills. All flavors mixed together well. House coffee was strong and good. 4 options of hotsauces 3 of which I've never heard of and were good. My waitress had great customer service and was always around to fill my water and take orders. The music made the restaurant flow smoothly. Only thing missing is a better waiting area. Other than that this place is perfect!
