Kata Robata////I have been here a couple of times however this time I walked-in craving ramen during lunch. Compared to other Japanese sushi/grill restaurants their lunch menu is quite long giving the consumer tons of options. We were fortunate to have a great waitress in Kaylyn (sorry I know miss typed it). She was great I asked a ton of questions and she was extremely professional and knowledgeable of the menu. The east coast oysters with caviar were small compared to some gulf oysters I have seen this season but nonetheless you can never go wrong with oysters and caviar together.
