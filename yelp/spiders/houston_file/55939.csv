Kata Robata////Their rice really sucks.  There are good//yummy tasting sushi rice out there and theirs is not one of them.  I would only get their foie gras sushi's(there's a scallop version too) and Chu toro nigiri.  Their quality definitely went down.  Even their  spicy soy ramen taste different now.  The portion got smaller, price went up higher.  I feel like they had a change..... for the worse.
