Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very family friendly, wonderful coffee and baked goods (had the macaroons, a few seasonal flavors and the chocolate and caramel which were all delicious), parking is okay (there was an attendant). Place seems very popular as we went at an off hour and there still was no place to sit
