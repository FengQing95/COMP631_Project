Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our server did a great job helping us out, and our waters were always refilled. Everyone was happy with their food. I had the protein flapjacks-- two thick and heart my pancakes with walnut and sugar free syrup on the side accompanied by two very peppery chicken sausage patties. Just what I needed after a big workout!  The veggie omelet was studded with colorful veggies and showcased its ooey gooey cheesiness when people inadvertently displayed nice cheese pulls with each bite :)  And the chicken fried steak was an enormous plate of thick fried meat covered with savory brown gravy.  In case that wasn't enough to clog your arteries, there is a mountain of scrambled eggs on top.  The friends said it was tasty, and they finished the massive 10inch piece of meat!
