Uchi////Greatest dinner of my life! The waiter was great at suggestions for our first time there. Every course was described even suggesting how to specifically eat each morsel to get the full taste. Each course was an exciting explosion of flavors. It was an anniversary dinner and they made sure to make us feel special and the ambiance was perfect. Even though it is small, it doesn't feel crowded, it is intimate. We felt like the only two people there. I Â cannot wait to go back!
