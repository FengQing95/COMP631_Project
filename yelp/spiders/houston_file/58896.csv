Baby Barnaby's////I come to Houston a fair bit and I have my usual spots I like to go.  Well this one is the newest to the list!  I really cannot get enough of pumpkin pancakes and when I saw them as a special I had to get them.  In reality its one big pumpkin pancake but its just as amazing as a whole stack.  Everyone at our table inhaled their food which I take as a huge vote of confidence.
