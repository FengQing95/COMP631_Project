Kata Robata////First timer here and everything was perfect to the pitch. Shout outs to Andrew for taking care of us and Â recommending really good choices on the menu. Portions are meant to be shared so don't expect anything super large in size. 72 hour cooked Kobe beef was one of the best meats I've ever had and I totally recommend it. Service is top notch and the environment is really chill. Definitely coming back real soon!!!
