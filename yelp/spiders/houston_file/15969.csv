JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is a nationwide-franchise concept that has specific aesthetic and operational standards we must follow. At all JINYA locations, the pork bones we use for our Tonkotsu broth are shipped via refrigerated trucks from California, as we are required to use premium, organically raised pigs.
