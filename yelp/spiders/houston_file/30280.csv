The Pit Room////A friend was visiting from San Francisco and really wanted to try TX BBQ, so I brought them to Pit Room. The cafeteria style BBQ joint is complete with a carving station where they place your freshly carved meat selections on a metal food tray. Top off your BBQ with a selection of pickled veggies (carrots, onions, jalapenos) from the condiment bar. Pit Room offers plenty of outdoor dining space, so it's a great option during the pandemic. Chase down your BBQ with a Topo Chico and you have yourself a proper TX BBQ experience.
