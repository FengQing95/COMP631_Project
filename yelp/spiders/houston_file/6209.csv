JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ambiance: I felt like I was in Ippudo, back in NYC, except it was smaller. The two large community tables helped with that, I'd say. I really liked the large mirror they had on one side that spanned across the entire restaurant. It gave the place more depth and made it feel bigger. Props to them for that. They truly shine when it comes to appearance. They really give you the nicer ramen bar feel.
