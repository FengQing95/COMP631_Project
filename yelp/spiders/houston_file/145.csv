JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ce to check out what's the hype all about. Restaurant is loud and everyone in the dining room has to raise his/her voice. Ramen broth is delicious, but the noodle and the broth are both like warm at best. I was holding my daughter in my arms and the food runner just shoved food in front of me and expected me to pass it on other than placing them on the table. Hey, on the bright side - he gave me extra food. Some other table must not gotten their dish. Nothing really special about the place other than it is trendy.
