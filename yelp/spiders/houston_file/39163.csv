Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have enjoyed dinner here before but never brunch and they did not disappoint. My sister and I enjoyed our experience from the time we walked in until we left. We sat at the bar and were greeted with water, then given the appropriate amount of time to look over the drink menu before ordering along with food when the bartender came back with our drinks. Our food and drinks were amazing, but the service was even better. Our bartender was friendly and helpful with any questions. It started raining when we wanted go leave so I asked a gentleman by the kitchen if they had plastic to go bags. He asked for my hair then offered us an umbrella even though we did not valet. This type of service is beyond amazing and I will be back really soon especially since this month is Houston Restaurant Week.
