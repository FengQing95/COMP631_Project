Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came back for a non HRW meal courtesy of the owner and had a pleasant experience. I got the cornbread as an appetizer (loved the dip that came with it) and spinach ensalada with salmon for my main course. My mom got the Cajun chicken with rice and green beans and it was tasty too. The customer service was on point. Overall I would come back here!
