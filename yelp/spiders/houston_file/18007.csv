Uchi////I came into town to visit my bf this weekend and he told me how we should try this place called Uchi and how I should call and make reservations for Saturday night.  Well to my surprise, reservations were completely full for Saturday night and was told they usually fill up for the weekends approx two weeks in advance.  We were told by phone that the bar had open seating and it is a full service bar.  So, from what we were thinking...we were going to get there at 5pm..sit at the bar, drink and then eat when we were getting hungry.
