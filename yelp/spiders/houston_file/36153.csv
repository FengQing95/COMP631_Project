Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Atmosphere & service were great . Food was just decent . Not impressed with the appetizers , both tasted old & lacked flavor . Entrees overall did not leave a lasting impression  for anyone in our party . Essentially just a step up from typical bar food . Beer was WAY overpriced . 18$ for 2 IPA's ? 7$ for a Karbach  ? Come on ! Who charges 6 pack prices per beer inside the loop ? Based on this experience we won't be back . There are 15 different places in Houston I would rather spend 50.00$ (including tip) on An Avocado salad with 4oz of grilled chicken and expensive beers .
