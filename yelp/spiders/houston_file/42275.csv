Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The drinks - I had a drip coffee, the dude had an iced latte. (He's such a girl, sometimes.) The drip coffee was the right temp WITHOUT being burnt (a true rarity in the slew of Houston eateries popping up in this 'hood) but wasn't, like, orgasmic or anything. Still, a good cup of drip coffee in this neighborhood for $3 is nothing to ignore. If you think that's overpriced, stay your ass in Sugar Land or Katy and eat at Chili's.
