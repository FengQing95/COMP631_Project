Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has been added to one of my favorite breakfast spots in Houston. Â I came on a Friday morning around 10:30am. It was an estimated 30 minute wait for 2. The hostess was very nice and welcoming. She took my name and cell phone number to text me when our table would be ready. There are some small tables available to sit and wait. There also hacky sack board games right outside the door for a little entertainment.
