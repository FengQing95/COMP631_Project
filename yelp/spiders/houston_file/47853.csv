Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////forgot to bring. So he leaves because we were not yet ready to order and so he can get us silverware. He never comes back with silverware. 10 more minutes pass and we had been ready to order. We flag a waitress down, she takes our order and we ask her to please get us silverware for our now cold coffee. She doesn't bring us silverware. But another random waitress comes by drops off the silverware without as much as looking our way, I say "thank you" she doesn't acknowledge us... I am pretty sure she didn't miss a step, it was like she was passing off a baton in a relay race.
