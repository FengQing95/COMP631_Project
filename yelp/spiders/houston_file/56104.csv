Kata Robata////The best sushi/ sashimi in Houston and comparable to anything nationwide.  I always make a stop here when in town. My favorite is the sashimi for two.  Comes on a huge plate with real grated wasabi. The fish selection varies and depends on the chef, but it never ceases to amaze me. The pieces are just the right size and melt in your mouth with a delicate taste that is just right and not overpowering. If it comes with raw shrimp, make sure to ask them to fry the heads as a perfect end to the meal. We usually get the sushi uni a la carte. Always prepared perfectly and delightfully addicting. When getting the sushi, the fish is complemented with rice that is seasoned just right and cooked to perfection where each grain is distinct yet sticky. This is the place for true sushi lovers.
