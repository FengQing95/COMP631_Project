Uchi////Everything about this meal was fabulous, every single bite of food from every dish was polished off by us without any trouble. The service was top-notch from start to finish. We arrived on time and were seated right away, and they even provided us this humungous umbrella to use from the parking lot because it was raining so heavily. Lauren was brilliant in figuring out what we would like. Different servers brought different plates through the meal, and each one explained what the item was (and even how we should eat it) in great detail. We felt looked after. Needless to say, we will be back to try some of the other things we didn't try this time.
