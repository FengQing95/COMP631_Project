Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I hate how much I love this place. The fried chicken and biscuits with sausage and gravy is an orgasmic experience. Best oatmeal cream pie on Earth. The macaron are to die for. The coffee is on point. Basically it lives up to the hype and is worth waiting in a long line and sitting in their crowded seating area.
