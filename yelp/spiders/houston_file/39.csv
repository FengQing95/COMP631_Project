Local Foods////A great neighborhood place for a soup and hearty sandwich! Everyone in our party loved their sandwiches, but thought the sides, while creative, were a little lackluster in taste. I had the falafel sandwich on wheat which was delicious and very filling. They can accomodate vegans; the chap at the cash register was very knowledgable about the ingredients in all of their menu items. I especially loved to casual vibe in the restaurant, which is perfectly appointed with a modernist, handcrafted feel that compliments the menu very well. We will most definitely be going back again!
