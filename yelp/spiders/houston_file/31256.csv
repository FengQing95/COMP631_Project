Local Foods////I've been a repeater here for a while now.  The sandwiches are fresh, consistent and yummy.  The sides are great accompaniments to the sandwiches.  The price is very good for the amount of food you get.  The homemade lemonade is the refreshing and tasty.  Service is impeccable.  Never had a bad experience here.  When i cant decide what i want to munch on, this is always my go to spot.
