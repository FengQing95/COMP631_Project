Kata Robata////We tried the Blueberry cake for dessert. The Earl Grey lemon ice cream was really good, but the cake was flavorless. I had to ask my friend what we ordered because I could not tell. I was saying "I thought the earl grey came with the blueberry cake, not the breadpudding." I would have loved to taste the blueberries.
