Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I discovered Bosscat Kitchen & Libations (BKL) during my one week stay in Houston's River Oaks neighborhood. My first weeknight indoor dining experience was so good, I went back for the Sunday brunch on the patio! Here's the details: Our first time at BKL was on Thanksgiving Eve at 8 PM. We'd made reservations, and we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I felt very comfortable with the seating; BKL has a spacious, open-air seating concept, intimate lighting, and there were many big-screen TV's so I was able to watch my Miami Heat as they played the Rockets right down the street in downtown Houston! We were taken very good care of by our server Kristina, who checked off all the boxes for who you'd want as a server: personable, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. BKL earns it's rep for being a whiskey house, but I was in the mood for tequila. I had the "Life Hack" with Hornitos black barrel tequila, mezcal, cinnamon and citrus...delicious. My wife, although not a whiskey drinker, had the Bosscat, containing Basil Hayden bourbon, with citrus, bitters, and rosemary. She loved it and remarked that it was so smooth she could barely taste the bourbon. For apps, we had Pig Candy and Pulled Pork Hush Puppies. Pig Candy (pork belly chunks coated with a rye whiskey caramel and toasted sesame topping) was a taste treat, although some of the chunks were rather fatty. The Hush Puppies were very good, with the cornbread batter accentuated by Carolina mustard sauce. For the main course, we had the 12-hour Beef Short Rib and the Cajun Brick Chicken. The Short Rib was soooo tender that it fell apart with the slightest touch of the fork. The black pepper sauce was a tad strong, but overall, with the accompanying scalloped potatoes and onions the dish was very satisfying. The Chicken is pressed down while cooking with a brick,
