JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now for the ramen...I had the tonkotsu black sub thick noodles. It had a taste that I wasn't expecting. After much thought, I realized it was the seaweed that gave it a bitter flavor. I took it out, and could then taste the creaminess I was looking for. I would have preferred they cut the egg in half. Even though it was called a seasoned egg, I didn't notice much flavor which was a bit disappointing.
