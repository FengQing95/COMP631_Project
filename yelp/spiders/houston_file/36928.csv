Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My girlfriend ordered the Avocado Farm Chopped Salad with no blue cheese because of preference. She ate 2 bites during the whole meal. The salad was super sour without the cheese. I know many people don't fancy blue cheese, so I recommend the servers to suggest a cheese to substitute or serve the dressing on the side.
