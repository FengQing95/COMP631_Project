Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their Nashville chicken sandwich was blend and taste like lard instead of the cayenne spicy. The chicken piece was smaller than the bread so when you finish it was just a bunch of left over bread. The chicken on top was a leg so it have bone in it which kind of dangerous because it look like a small breast on top which hurt my teeth.
