Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cool place for socializing and trying some whiskey drinks. Food is decent but nothing over the top. I would say it's a little loud up front for date night. Ask to sit in the back if you want to converse. I give 4 stars because of the food being a little lacking. Service is always good tho. I have and will return to Bosscat.
