Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Excellent and worth the wait (and price tag - family of 5 was $90 after tip). My wife and I prefer their savory dishes like the Spuds Deluxe and the Breakfast Burrito, also their sausage links are delicious.  The kids loved the pancakes - specifically the Blueberry Danish ones, they have tasty lemon cream in the center.  Also, the apple juice was an unexpected delight.  The coffee was said to be really good - I thought it was just ok. I did have a macchiato too, it was pretty good. We'll be back again.
