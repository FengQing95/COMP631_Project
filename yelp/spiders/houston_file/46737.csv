Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has become my favorite breakfast place in Houston--in part because of a great waiter but mostly because the food is so damn good.  We ate there early this afternoon and had a brief wait.  We lucked out, too, because we got our favorite server--Olias.  He just seems to know which food and beverages to suggest to us at a given moment, and his recommendations have been spot on.   We ordered the corn beef hash and substituted the toast for Drunken Monkey French Toast, which was as divine as Olias said that it would be.   Even though the food took a while, he kept us lubricated with Dirty Drunken Chais and his witty, irreverent commentary.   The combination of the Drunken Monkey French Toast, the Dirty Drunken Chai, the corned beef hash, and the entertainment provided by Olias and his colleagues really set the mood for the morning after Halloween.  I highly recommend trying out this restaurant--even if there is a wait.
