JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Also, thank you for the constructive note about our service. I think you can agree that when the house gets full, the energy in the space becomes fast-paced and sometimes a little hectic. It is these times I often remind the servers to slow down, take a breath and focus on the details, mostly to head off potential mistakes. As you might imagine, this is often easier said than done. But we do our best to get things done as quickly as possible and with as few errors as possible. And lastly, much appreciation for your kind words regarding our food, though let's agree to disagree on our gyoza! Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
