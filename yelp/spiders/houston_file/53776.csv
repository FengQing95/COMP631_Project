Kata Robata////My party of 3 defaulted here on a Saturday night because we knew better than trying Uchi without a reservation. We called to check on the wait and was told 30-40 but end up waiting 50 minutes even though the restaurant was full of empty tables. Â All is well if the food makes up for the delay....
