Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In all of my travels and baked good consumption I have never found croissant dough so magically sky high. Flaky on the outside, tender buttery deliciousness on the inside. It is truly a sight to be seen and devoured! Main courses also never cease to disappoint. Coffee is great. This is tops on my list for Houston eats.
