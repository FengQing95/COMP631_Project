Uchi////I love this restaurant but even when you call for to-go or come RIGHT when it opens, expect a wait.  If you are very frugal and come in here to expect an amazing time, keep away.  The portions are going to be small.  I personally love tapas style entrees, you get to try a little bit of everything without getting too full.  I went during Happy hour and they offer menu items at partial portions (for their already small portions) for Happy Hour price.
