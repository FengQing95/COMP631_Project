Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Basically, you're really missing out on the full experience if you limit yourself to just ordering an entree. The almond croissants are my FAVORITE. I wouldn't normally pay more than $3 for a croissant anywhere else but I find myself treating myself to one whenever I'm here. Haven't tried the cakes here but the mini desserts (I favor the ones with chocolate) have all been great.
