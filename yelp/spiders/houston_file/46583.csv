Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute bistro and bakery! Lots of selections to choose from that I wanted to get everything, but I can't so I settled for the 3 pastries and their cold brew and they were decadent! This place could easily be a favorite in New York City if they had a location there!
