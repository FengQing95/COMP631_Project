Local Foods////They're quite creative and innovative with the sandwiches on their menu. A particular favorite of mine is their duck confit (nom). Their organic concept is quite appealing, as there aren't many other restaurants in Houston with their same eclectic feel. The sides are definitely interesting, but don't fail on taste. My favorites are the kale and beets. It's a delicious take on vegetables I think many people aren't too keen on trying.
