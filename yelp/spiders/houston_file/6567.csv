JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When we got our food, our waiter never came to check on us. We paid extra for sodas and despite being finished early into the appetizer, they were not once refilled. Another pet peeve of my soda guzzling S.O. Ok so we had waters from before we ordered the sodas, we drank those. I attempted to get the attention of our waiter but as you'll quickly see, it was more difficult than it was worth in this instance.
