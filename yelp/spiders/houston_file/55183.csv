Kata Robata////It was easy to make resos online through their website; however they aren't confirmed until that day.  Glad we made them because their was a wait already  at 6:45 on a Friday evening.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  The sashimi and roll we had was excellent along with the HOT grilled octopus app!!!  Yummy!!!
