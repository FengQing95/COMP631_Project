Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Y'all best not be hitting that snooze button if you want to check out this place, and yes, the hype is real! Snooze is officially one of my favorite places to go for breakfast and brunch. They have such an array of dishes to choose from that you can legit go in multiple times in a week and try something new and even have the confidence that it'll be bangin'.
