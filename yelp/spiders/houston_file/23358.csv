Uchi////It's impossible to put into words how amazing Uchi is.  The food, staff, and service are all top notch, and I haven't found a better sushi place anywhere in Houston.  The chefs do an incredible job pairing simple ingredients together in combinations that you wouldn't ever expect (yellowtail over orange slices, what?), but the tastes and presentation are always beyond perfect.
