Uchi////I had the pleasure of dining at Uchi over the summer!  I met a few friends there, and since our entire party on the reservation hadn't made it yet, the hostess escorted us out to the patio area.  There was ample seating outside while we waited, along with a waitress walking around to take drink orders, as well as offer samplings of some of their menu items.  I thought that all of this was great, excluding the fact that they allowed smoking out there.  I can't take being around smoke and it caused us all to go back inside to finish waiting.  I highly recommend Uchi make this a non-smoking restaurant, even though it is outside on their patio.
