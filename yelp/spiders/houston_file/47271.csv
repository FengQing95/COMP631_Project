Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place serves oily food and has terrible staff. There is a hostess at the front with blue hair and she was incredibly rude. The restaurant is overcrowded and the wait is too long for food that is at best, mediocre. Save your stomach, time, and money for real restaurants in houston.
