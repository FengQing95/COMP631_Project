Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been here for brunch and liked it but it's definitely not a dinner place. Had an early dinner here with friends before bridesmaid dress shopping and it was lack luster. The drinks were pretty good. We dined for #HRW 1st course: oysters- too much cornmeal not enough oyster. With that being said the cornmeal was well seasoned and the bit of oyster inside was cooked perfectly. My friends had the tuna wraps (she said they were OK nothing special) and hot chicken dip-it was oily, I didn't taste any chicken in my bite and it kind of tasted like a spicy queso. 2 hamburger pickle slices were placed on the side of the plate. Either put a spear or leave it off, it looked sad. 2nd course-Server recommended the snapper so I ordered it and boy was I glad. It was cooked nicely, the sauce on top was a little sweet but not overpowering. The grain was well seasoned, nutty flavor and very filling. Friends ordered drunken crab pasta-NO seasoning, tasted like water was the sauce. (she took it home to doctor it up with flavor) And short rib hash I didn't get to taste it but she had one bite and sent it back for the snapper. Which the waiter said he could do if she didn't like it while we were ordering b/c she was on the fence. Dessert-banana pudding was banana pudding. They could have made it their own with a homemade cookie or something. The brownie..disgusting! How do you mess up a brownie? It was prepackaged I believe and not fudgy. The chocolate tasted old. I just ate my ice cream. Moral of the story-come for brunch or drinks. The boss cat and boss lady were tasty I recommend those.
