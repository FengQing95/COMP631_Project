Uchi////8. Negimaki: One of the best sushi rolls I've had from here - too bad it's only a daily special. Everything was showcased and no ingredient was left behind. The jalapeno wasn't overbearing, the avocado was flavorful, the green onion was crunchy, and the daikon sweetened the whole thing nicely against the vinegar rice.
