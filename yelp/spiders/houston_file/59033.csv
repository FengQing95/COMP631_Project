Baby Barnaby's////Their breakfast is always fresh and some of it is pretty healthy- like their low carb burrito. Their waffles are pretty sensational, and even just their regular breakfast plate is pretty good- I normally substitute the potatoes for black beans- but either way... their food is enough for me to get over the parking situation and keep coming back.
