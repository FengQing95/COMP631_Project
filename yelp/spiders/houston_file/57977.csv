Kata Robata////2 stars for reservation/front of house issues. Called multiple times on 09/15/21 starting from when they opened around 11:30am to later in the afternoon. Booked a reservation off of Resy since I was unable to reach by phone 24 hours before the reservation. Under special requests I indicated I tried calling to request omakase but unable to reach anyone and wanting to be seated at the sushi bar.
