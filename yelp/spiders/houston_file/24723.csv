Uchi////I've been going to Uchi since there was only the one Uchi on South Lamar in Austin. I had many anniversary dinners there and even had my wedding rehearsal dinner in the private room at Uchiko Austin. I LOVED the brussel sprouts, walu walu, nasu nigiri, ham and eggs, anago agemono, foie nigiri, fried milk. I've basically had every item on every Uchi menu. I treasure the menu I have that Tyson Cole signed.
