Kata Robata////I came here with some coworkers to grab lunch. I think their menu should be a little more detailed - I had to ask a lot of questions about the rolls and usually sushi menu's list descriptions of each. Otherwise, the lunch special was great and fairly priced. The desserts were my favorite - the green tea cheesecake and chocolate mousse are a must try. Would definitely come again on days I crave sushi!
