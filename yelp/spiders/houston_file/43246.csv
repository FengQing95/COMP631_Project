Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The slogan of the establishment, "Only for All," is easy to experience and believe as there is little air of pretentiousness or excessive elegance. Despite common associations of fancy bakeries and cafes with uppity rich folk, I feel quite comfortable walking in shorts and backwards cap, and having a casual time with friends.
