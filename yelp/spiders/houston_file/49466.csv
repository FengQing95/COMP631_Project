Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Honestly, I want to say the wait to get a seat at Snooze is not really worth the hype. But, I'm not saying their food isn't good. It's just not significantly better than other breakfast/brunch spots I've been to in Houston. I did appreciate the unlimited cups of coffee while we waited for our seats. Once we were finally settled in, we got the Benny Goodman, Chilaquiles Benedict, OMG! French toast, and the French toast neat. All were good, but they weren't great. The Benny Goodman was quite rich because of the cream cheese. But, there was this hot sauce called Yellow Bird Serrano sauce, and it was just right in cutting the richness of the dish. I put it all over my Chilaquiles Benedict too, which had some pretty tasty barbacoa and corn tortillas in it. The eggs were perfectly runny for both benedict dishes. But, if I had to choose, I'd pick the Chilaquiles Benedict again. Both french toast dishes were just ok. Other than the beautifully delicious salted caramel sauce in the OMG! French toast, both of them tasted truly like semi-dry bread. We probably won't order these again. If I happen to come again, maybe at a non peak time, I would like to see what the fuss is all about on their pancake dishes. They do look delicious in pictures. Otherwise, just be prepared for the wait here. Maybe bring a book or some music to listen to, and take advantage of their complimentary coffee.
