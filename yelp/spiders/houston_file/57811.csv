Kata Robata////We had an amazing experience with Kata Robata tonight.  We got takeout and all of the food was absolutely fantastic!  We had the lobster and crab ramen, the tropical tuna roll, the vegan soba salad, and the vegan dumplings.  Everything was so fresh and flavorful.  Even more amazing was that the manager quickly put our order together and refused to accept payment when she discovered they had forgotten to submit the advance order that we had called in.  We have been going here for years and will definitely continue to have dinners there.  It is one of our favorites.
