Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The sauce for the portobello mushroom fries was similar to a blooming onion which is one of my favorites. The mushrooms had a big too much batter for me where the flour started to infringe on the flavor / texture of the mushroom. I'd prefer more light tempura style for these.
