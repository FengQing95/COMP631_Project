JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love spicy food, so of course I had to try the spicy chicken ramen. The food came fast which was great, but the food itself was pretty okay. One would probably need a bowl or two of ramen in order to be fully satisfied, but this place is great for if you're trying to you're adventurous and into trying new foods. Furthermore, besides the food, the ambiance of this place is great. Would highly recommend for a date night in the Houston midtown area.
