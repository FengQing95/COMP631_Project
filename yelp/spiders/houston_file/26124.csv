The Pit Room////We ordered takeout.  4 pounds of brisket, 3 pounds of jalapeño sausage, a pint of beans and 1 pound of pork ribs.  Arrive 5 minutes early and it was ready and waiting.  We loaded up some little baggies with onions and jalapeños.   They have that beautiful black crust with red meat on the brisket and ribs.   The meat was tender, but a little dry (thus the 4 stars instead of 5).   Sauce is tangy not sweet.  The jalapeño sausage were too spicy for most of our party, but really good.  Yes I'd return.
