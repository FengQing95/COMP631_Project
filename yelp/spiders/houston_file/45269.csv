Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything from the bakery was just ok. We had the croissants with our lattes - flaky but not as buttery as the ones from whole foods. Â Macarons are good compared to Sweet. Nutella was very creamy. Bought the fruit croissant and almond croissant for friends and they said the fruit was too sweet but almond was very good.
