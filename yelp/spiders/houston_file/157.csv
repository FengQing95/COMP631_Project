JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Until I ate there a few days ago, my concept of ramen was something that came in little packets to which one added boiling water into which you emptied a mysterious powder that came with the package, waited a few minutes and bingo, you've got some tasty noodles. There were some noodle shops around Houston but this place was touted as being something special and so Â we went there for a quick meal before the theater. The decor is interesting, the service amateurish and the noise level so high so you cannot have a conversation. The printed menu is difficult to read because of the way it had been printed. Artistically it was quite good but it was hard to find out exactly what each exotically named dish contained. Only wheat and no rice noodles were available which made it almost impossible for anyone with gluten hypersensitivity to find something to eat. Not knowing what to order, I succumbed to my waiter's recommendation and ordered a"Black" something ramen. It was supposed to be in a pork- based broth with pieces of chicken and pork with noodles and what, was pictured on the menu, a fried or raw egg that cooked itself in the broth like in a nabeyaki udon, but, what I got was a hard-boiled egg of uncertain vintage that looked dubious and inedible. I'm still looking for the pieces of pork and chicken. I am still unable to attribute a flavor to the broth. You know, onion soup tastes like onion and asparagus soup tastes like asparagus but this broth was a yellow-brown effluent with absolutely no identifiable characteristics. Even pouring a fair amount of the dark fluid labeled "ramen sauce" produced no effect. Bottom line, unless I find another ramen restaurant and have a good experience, I'll stick with the little packets.
