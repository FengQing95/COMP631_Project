Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If I could give zero stars I would. This restaurant did not honor Houston Restaurant Week despite having enrolled in the HRW program. We went to Bosscat today for lunch. It is a Monday, Labor Day. Today is the last day for HRW. HR W lunches are Monday through Friday per the HR W website. We were told by Bosscat they wouldn't honor the HRW lunch menu, and here were their excuses. 1. "Our regulars know we serve brunch on holidays." How does that have anything to do with the very limited menu Bosscat was supposed to serve for lunch on HRW or compliance with what they chose to advertise on the HR W website? The answer is: nothing. Bosscat, did you advertise to the "regulars" that you were stopping your participation in HR W early? I guess first timers like myself should have become a "regular" so I would still receive no notice that HR W was not being honored the last day of the program. Â 2. "Go visit our website. It mentions we serve brunch." Nothing on Bosscat's website says it was not going to serve the HR W lunch menu on Labor Day. 3. "Our kitchen isn't set up to make HR W lunch and brunch." Bosscat had a hamburger and fries on the HR W lunch menu (that's what we were going to order). Bosscat had a couple of burgers on the brunch menu and fries and tots were also on the brunch menu, but you had to pay extra for those. Bosscat, if you are serving burgers and fries or tots for brunch, please explain how you are unable to make a burger and fries or tots if it comes off the HR W menu? The answer: nothing. I've gone to over a dozen restaurants for HR W over the past three years. This was the only time I've gone to a HR W restaurant that did not offer the HR W menu as advertised. Three people would have dined off the HR W menu at lunch if Bossca t had let us order off the HR W menu. According to the HR W website, that equated to 27 meals lost because Bossca t decided to arbitrarily terminate its lunch participation early. The food bank donation is the reason my family orders off the HR W menu. Bosscat, if you are reading this review, how about you donate $500 to the Houston Food Bank to compensate for the lost donations and the meritless excuses offered to me and my family. I would love to see a copy of that check and an acknowledgement by the Food Bank of its receipt.
