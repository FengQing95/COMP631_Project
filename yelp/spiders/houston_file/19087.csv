Uchi////Since it was our first visit to Uchi, we did the omakase, ten course meal, for two people. We had three guidelines: 1) we wanted to have some salmon 2) we wanted to try the much talked about brussel sprouts 3) we were hungry! Our server was able to plot out a progression of dishes that we were very pleased with and the excitement of figuring out what would be next was also very fun. Some of the highlights included: the machi cure (sort of like "nachos" with yuka crisps, yellowtail, pear and marcona almonds), a yokai berry salad, the walu walu, and the bacon tataki. And, yes, those brussel sprouts were fantastic. The dessert was amazing as well - cantaloupe sherbet, buttermilk sabayon with elderflower!
