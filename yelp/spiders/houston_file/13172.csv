JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The environment is young, hip, and contemporary inside.  Most seating is going to be on 2 large community style tables - which is good for small parties.  They do have limited larger group tables, but I imagine those would be hard to come by.  Front of the restaurant has bar which you can have a few drinks before you are seated.
