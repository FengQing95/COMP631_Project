Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First, we are greeted with a DJ that was On. Point. He played every genre from the 70s to current. He set the atmosphere. Our server Terry guided us through the menu. We wasted our time trying to decide before he took us on a culinary journey that enticed our pallets, from the libations to the gastronomy fare. And everything was DELICIOUS. We have to come back.
