The Pit Room////I went on a Friday evening close to 7 pm and I was able to pull up to a parking spot right in front. Â Once I entered I was 2nd in line! This was turning out to be much better than expected. I place my order and you move along like a buffet type line and when you get to the end you can pay and your food will arrive about the same time.
