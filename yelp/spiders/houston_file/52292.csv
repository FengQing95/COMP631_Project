Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We stopped in the Houston location before our flight out. It did not disappoint. The wait to be seated was fairly short for a Tuesday morning. Once seated, our server could've been a little more attentive and we waited a little while for our food but I must say it was well worth the wait. We ordered the OMG French toast, scrambled eggs with hash browns and chorizo. Pineapple upside down pancakes, bacon, and grits. Everything is as delicious. I was t a fan of the chorizo but I've never had it before so my impression should be taken with a grain of salt as it relates to the chorizo. We will definitely return.
