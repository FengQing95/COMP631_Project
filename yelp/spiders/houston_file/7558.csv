JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow, I had no idea it was so popular! A friend and I met for a late lunch at 3:30, and we just so happened to catch the only 20 minutes during that afternoon where there wasn't a line out the door! We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth which was totally fine. The place is dimly lit and loud, but it had a great energy. I dug it. The booths are also very comfy and spacious, which was a plus for me with my bad back.
