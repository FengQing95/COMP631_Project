Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you want an awesome breakfast, this is the place to grab a plate! The food is absolutely delicious, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. To make brunch a bit more fun, the drink menu is great ... mimosa's are good, but I'm a huge fan of the "Boss Hog" bloody mary ... bourbon, bacon, and a tangy bloody mary mix is golden!
