JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- Parking is a doozie. There are some valet options about 1/2 block away and street parking is available at night but Jinya is located on a relatively busy street, so keep that in mind and mentally prepare yourself. We also saw a self-park lot next to the valet lot that was, shocker, full.
