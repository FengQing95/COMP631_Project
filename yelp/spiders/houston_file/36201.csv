Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Finally got a chance to check this place out. I have to admit I'm very impressed. Awesome decor. Great food.  They have the best whiskey selection in Houston.  The service was on point.  The staff must be trained very well because my waiter knew so much about the menu and the whiskey selections. Ask for James by the way. I'll def be coming back!
