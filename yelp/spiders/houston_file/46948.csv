Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The lines are always long. The wait time is ridiculous and the prices are inflated. The staff is friendly and welcoming. You'll have a better time, better food, better wait lines, better parking, and better prices if you choose to skip this place and choose Barnaby's. I've lived in the neighborhood for over 10 years, because of the lines and parking I have only been able to eat at Snooze 3 times. There's literally no parking area for this restaurant.
