Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Don't be stupid and come on a weekend if you're expecting a relaxing environment with no line. Come during the week if you can and take your time. If you do come on the weekend, don't complain about long lines and rushed service. It's a different place then. During the week, it's calm and relaxed and awesome. At this point, I've eaten my way through most of the breakfast items. My favorites are the croissants, the daily bread, and the scone with jam and butter. The coffee is underrated, and a latte goes well with the sweet baked goods.
