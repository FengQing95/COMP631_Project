Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food was fantastic, from presentation to taste. I was able to have a bite of my boyfriend's eggplant sandwich and the dutch crunch roll that came as the bread had a great complementary sweet flavor to the fried eggplant. I ordered the snapper tartine. While the recipe of grapefruit, potato salad, and snapper tasted delicious, it was a bit awkward to eat. The dish is served as the fish and potato salad on top of a slice of bread. The slice is too big and heavy to be picked up and eaten with the hands. What I ended up doing was using my fork and knife and cutting into it to take bites, which just seems a little unnatural. I did not enjoy the pickles that came with the dishes, though. The pickles that CB made had less sodium and salt and was probably more healthy than regular pickles. However, I am a pickle fan, and I don't have them enough to enjoy the healthier alternative at CB, which was more sweet than sour. It was not bad, and I am willing to try them again to rewire my taste buds. Regardless, food was very good and I cannot wait to come back to try more.
