Uchi////Nasu nigiri: grilled eggplant delicately placed on sushi rice. I never in my life thought eggplant would taste soooooo sooo good. The outer skin was grilled until it was crispy but the inner part of the eggplant was so supple and silky in texture, it almost tasted fatty in consistency. It sounds a little gross but it is such an outstanding dish. Hey, for $3, why not?!
