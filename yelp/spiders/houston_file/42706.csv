Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Then when I wanted a box for my leftover sticky bun, I ask the guy at the register (because the boxes were behind him, to his left) he gives me a stupid look and points in front of him saying "ask one of them, they can help you" pointing at the people in the cafe bar. Just so that one of the girls, walks behind this dude an gets a box. What an idiot.
