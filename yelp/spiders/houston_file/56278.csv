Kata Robata////Saturday night dinner, fierce Lychee martinis w/ coconut rum & vodka or gin. Octopus crudo was limp slivers  w/ tangy sauce. Not our favorite. But the Miso crusted bone marrow was excellent! And a very generous portion, 3 large bones,  served w/ 3 salts, green tea & truffle  were my favorite.  The two nain courses, the Sea Bass w/ Fois Gras & Arugula & the Lobster Tempura were excellent!  The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection & the sauce, a tomato umeboshi was just the right blend of sweet and tangy.the Tempura lobster was cooked as well & had eggplant, potatoes, zucchini,  & pepper.
