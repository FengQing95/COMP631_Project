Kata Robata////We were enjoying ourselves until it got crowded around 7pm. Our table is by the front door and bar so people who were waiting for seats crowded around the bar/ front door area. This couple - their backs were literally were 1 inch away from our table. That was really annoying. I'm trying to enjoy my meal here. Once we left, they immediately sat at our table. They were waiting for us to leave all along! Kata Robata should tell these people to wait a little bit further than 1 inch away from us??? Well the waiter/ hostesses were overwhelmed with how busy they are. Our water refills were slow and when our sushi arrived there were no soy sauce on our table. We had to quickly get someone's attention and request for soy sauce.
