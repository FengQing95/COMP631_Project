Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I subtracted one star for the general disinterest of the staff. But the other 4 stars are for ambiance and tastiness. I had the Lavender Lemonade and my taste buds are still dancing. I love the visual stimulation of the displays and the entire feel of the place. I would definitely return.
