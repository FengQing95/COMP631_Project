Uchi////Ate here last night and wasn't entirely impressed. The spicy crunchy tuna (SCT) and brussels sprouts were delicious. I did enjoy the Walu Walu but I would have to say the hot rock was mediocre. My wife enjoyed one of their signature sake drinks with watermelon and I had your traditional hot sake. Overall the drinks were decently priced. For desert we ordered the fried milk. This was very good but my only complaint would be that the dish came with 3 fried milk... over all good meal but very overpriced. I would go back for the SCT roll and Brussels but that's about it.
