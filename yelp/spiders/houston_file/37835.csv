Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went on a Sunday morning for brunch! Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place. Just note that on Sundays for brunch there is a live DJ who did add some fun to the place, however I felt like it was too loud at times. I was literally inches away from my fiance and still had atrouble hearing him over the music. but it was fun. There was a decently long wait for a table, but there was ample space up at the bar where we didn't mind sitting and dining. Pretty interesting drink menu! I couldn't make up my mind so I had the bartender make me something and all i told him was that I wanted something fruity. He handed me a pineapple cup and inside was a yummy pineapple margarita. Solid drink. My fiance, who is a huge fan of micheladas, loved the ones from here.
