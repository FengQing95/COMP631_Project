Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First meal in Houston, and we decided to try brunch at Bosscat. My friend made a reservation in advance so we didn't have to wait. The restaurant was very spacious, and the whiskey room looked cool to rent for private events. Our waiter was nice, but seemed a little scattered when we asked him for his recommendations. He basically stated everything on the entree list which wasn't helpful. We ended up starting with the tatchos which were really good, I enjoyed the spice of the chorizo with the jalape√±os and the tator tots were nice and crispy. Then we got the short rib chilaquiles which didn't look appetizing initially but were very good. The chips weren't completely soggy with all of the ingredients, the sauce had a good flavor and the short rib was cooked well. Finally, we had the fruity pebble French toast which was a very big disappointment. The presentation was lovely, but the texture was tough. It was so chewy, we thought the bread might be stale. The bottom piece was softer but only because it had been soaking in the condensed milk for a while. Definitely one of the worst French roasts I've ever had.
