Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great first visit. Hit it on a Friday afternoon. Was pleased they flaunt Texas made beer... like the good Texas stuff... they also have a massive whiskey collection and their food was really on point as well. Do not pass up the wings as an appetizer which they routinely offer for happy hour. Get in here now... parking isn't the best but valet is available.
