The Pit Room////Decent prices, good portions. I had the brisket and the pork ribs. Both had excellent flavor and the brisket is exactly as good as all these other reviews say it is. The mac and cheese is spectacularly creamy, the corn is flavorful. My dining companion had the turkey and pulled pork and raved about both. He didn't even bother to use the extra sauce provided, the meat stood on its own. He loved the mac and cheese as well but felt the corn may have been a touch overdone. All and all some of the best BBQ we've had.
