The Pit Room////Best beef rib we have ever eaten. Beef rib meat so tender, moist, not greasy, perfectly seasoned - eaten alone or with the homemade bbq sauce is just heaven in your mouth. My partner ate it so fast while I was taking pictures, I didn't even get to eat half of it cuz he ate it so quickly.
