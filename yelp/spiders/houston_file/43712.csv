Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A perfect spot for morning breakfast.  Nice, clean interior.  Very friendly helpful staff.  Good coffee.  For breakfast I had the Huevo Ahogado "Drowned Egg".  A soft egg in a chipotle stewed tomato sauce with fresh cactus and a baguette.  Delicious and sauce had a nice spice to it.  Everything looked good but I only had time for one meal.
