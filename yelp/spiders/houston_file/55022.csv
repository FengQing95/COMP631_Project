Kata Robata////Food - Our go to favorites are the Hamachi  & jalepeno sashimi, amberjack & foie Gras (anything with foie Gras is a winner to me), pepper jack tuna, waygu beef (tender!!), and of course foie gras is the icing on top.  There's nothing like it. Just amazing. The sushi is fresh, cool and light with a wonderful assortment of side flavors and garnishes that make the whole thing pop. We've added the spicy soy ramen to our order lately and glad we did. The texture of the ramen is just right. The broth is creamy, flavorful yet not too salty. It's the perfect complement to our meal.
