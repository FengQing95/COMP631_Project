JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went once when they first opened, and it was pretty good, but since then have tried going 5 times and there is always at least an hour wait, even on weekdays or towards the end of the night. Made worse by the fact they don't take reservations, don't seat you unless everyone is there, and don't have anywhere to wait. I can't rate something positively if I can't even eat there anymore.
