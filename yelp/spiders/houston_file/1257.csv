JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If I can give this shitty place 0 stars I would. The food is not all the rage and it's over priced. First off I didn't see my waiter the whole time I was there until the check came! Apparently from my ticket his name is Alex! I had to flag down different waitresses who walked by me. I came on a weekday! I waited 15 min before hunting someone down to take my order!! When my soup came out it was cold! I asked for it to be reheated!! And guess what? They charge you 50 cents to reheat the soup the gave you cold! It wasn't that busy of a night for me to have to hunt down service. Everything you ask for you will be charged. Jalapeño that's another $1.00. I'm not cheap but damn why do I have to pay for bad service and condiments??? It's like going to a hot dog stand and paying for ketchup!! The only thing that was ok there was the shrimp balls. Nobody refilled my drink the whole time I was there. Don't ever go to jinya unless you want to feel like you are begging for food or begging for service! Or unless you don't mind paying them to reheat your cold soup that was suppose to be served hot! What a big disappointment! You should go to tiger den in bellaire! This place doesn't even compare. Jinya makes you feel like you're bothering the waitress when you ask for the simple things they did not bring out in the first place! You couldn't freaking  pay me to come back! I rather sit and starve and swallow my own spit than sip on their disgusting broth!
