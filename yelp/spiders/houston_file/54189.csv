Kata Robata////I got the mini-beignets and St. Arnold's root beer float. It was good, but not great. The blueberry jam that came with the beignets was so good that I wanted to drink it straight out of the little white dish. I refrained. The beignets were a little too chewy and stiff. I need a little pillow of light, fluffy dough and this was not it. It was served at room temperature, so that might have been part of the problem.
