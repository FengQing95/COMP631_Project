Kata Robata////Came here so many times. Food is wonderful. I like the sushi here better than that in Uchi. BUT very RUDE hostess. Everytime we came here they were like not happy to see guests coming. Never smile and never say thank you. I myself worked as a hostess before so I really don't understand why such a good restaurant hire such people
