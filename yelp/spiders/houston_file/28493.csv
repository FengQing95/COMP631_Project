The Pit Room////The mac n cheese was fabulous! So creamy! I got the pint and felt it was a little on the small side, but it was still great! (They serve it in a little cardboard dish thing, rather than in a pint container, so it's hard to tell whether it's actually a pint or not....It probably is indeed a pint, my stomach just wanted more!!!!)
