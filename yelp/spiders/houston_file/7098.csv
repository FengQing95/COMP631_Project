JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The hostess was so nice upon arrival! I got there at 11:30am, so a little before the lunch rush. I was seated right away. The waitress was really sweet too! She offered great recommendations. We ordered cauliflower, fried Brussel sprouts, a side salad and dumplings. Everything tastes really fresh! The salad dressing was really good and so were other appetizers. I had the hot tonkatsu ramen with Bok Choy and an egg edition. Â I felt like I was getting a cold that day, so it was really good. It was really good and hit the spot. My coworkers loved their spicy chicken ramen as well. I enjoyed it! I will be back!
