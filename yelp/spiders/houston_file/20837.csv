Uchi////Me and my friend went here for second time to look for Patrick again on a working day, however it is very disappointing. We arrived at Uchi around 5.45pm and there's no available space at the sushi bar. So we get seated at the long table. Service is not good and we can hear other people's conversation. So, we decided not to dine here unless we get to sit at the sushi bar.
