JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jackson - Thanks for your review. At present the 3-story parking garage adjacent to our restaurant is undergoing renovation on the third floor, which cuts off several dozen spaces. In addition, the City of Houston has been digging up Lousiana and Milam Streets for the past two months, which has also severely restricted parking.
