Uchi////I have been dying to come here since they opened in Houston. I finally decided to go and sit at the bar. I was going to order off the happy hour menu and ended up doing the chefs tasting. And I am so glad I did! The tasting was pricey but so amazing and worth it! I would highly recommend going here even if it is to enjoy the bar menu. You wont be disappointed!
