JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Even if I usually can't finish an order, I'm always satisfied with the ramen here! I'm salivating just thinking about the pork in the Cha Cha Cha bowl; it is tender and pairs well with the thick noodles - all of which contributes to the nap I always want to take after I eat here. The flavors are balanced kindly, so there isn't too much of anything in your bowl. Honestly mouthwatering!
