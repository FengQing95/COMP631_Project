Uchi////I came here on a Saturday night with a friend from out of town and we had the worst service ever! When we first sat down, not a single person greeted us or got is water for about 15 minutes. Finally we had to flag a random person down and ask them for our waiter. Our waiter finally came and he was this blonde surfer type who seem completely disinterested in his job. No enthusiasm and didn't even really explain the specials and etc. Well, we got our food but each dish took forever to come out and there was a lot of space in between each dish. The food was just blah and definitely not worth the bad experience. Never again Uchi!
