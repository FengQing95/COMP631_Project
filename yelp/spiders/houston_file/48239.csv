Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, would definitely recommend this spot just budget enough time. There is ALWAYS a wait (even at 8AM and even for a sole bar seat). This place is probably the most popular breakfast/brunch spot in the city. I overhead waits for over an hour for a table of four. They do not take reservations so put your name down and plan on doing something else in the area for that time period (they will text you when your seat is ready).
