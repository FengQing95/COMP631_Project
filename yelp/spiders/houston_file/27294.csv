The Pit Room////The Pit Room is the closest thing to Killen's inside the loop. For being in a busy location where every square inch is practically priceless, there's more than enough seating and parking. I've had their brisket, ribs, sausage, tacos, and almost all the sides. Everything is a hit except possibly the coleslaw. I'm pretty picky about coleslaw, and I'm just not a fan of theirs. Otherwise, I love the mac n cheese, potato salad and beans! And even though their meats are off the chain (the brisket is really the stand out winner), their tacos are my fave--especially the brisket! They load up the meat and other goodies into a delicious tortilla! It's a bit pricey, but I don't really know of a good BBQ joint that isn't, especially in such a convenient area.
