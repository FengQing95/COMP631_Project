Uchi////We started with the Uchi salad, which was essentially a handful of hydroponic romaine leaves each topped with a fleur de sel (what a clever idea!) in shot glasses with a edamame jalapeno dressing to dip the leaves. Totally unexpected, and delicious in a hip kind of way.  This is upscale Houston food circa 2012, and we feel blessed for getting to try it.  I would eat this salad every day of the year if I could.
