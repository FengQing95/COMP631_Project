Baby Barnaby's////Took off 2 stars because the woman server on the patio was awful! Scott is fabulous- she doesn't like her job and it shows. She never checks back and speaks in an annoying tone . Waited forever for a check while they had folks lined up for tables. Too bad - otherwise a great place - she ruins it.
