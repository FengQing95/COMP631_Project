Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This food was very good. The hill mountain mule was good, it could have been a bit sweeter. My friend loved the droppin beetz cocktail, it was balanced for sure, just wasn't my cup of tea. I did the pancake trio, special of the day, blueberry, and pineapple upside down. Pineapple upside down was perfect, blueberry had too much icing and then had icing in the middle...it should be no icing wit blueberry sauce or something, the special of the day was good. My fried got a sandwich which was good, can't remember the name, but check my pics :-). Saturday: it was super packed, 1 hour wait, parking sucked lol.
