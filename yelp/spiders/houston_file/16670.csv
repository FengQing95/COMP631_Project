JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Joanna - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry for your negative experiences with our wait times. We always encourage guests to visit any of our seven other JINYA locations in Houston, most of which have more reasonable wait times during peak hours. In addition, I understand our location can be somewhat disadvantageous for some, but as far as metered-parking is concerned, the adjacent parking garage -- to our knowledge -- is the only free parking garage in Midtown. However, as you're probably aware, the neighborhood is constantly changing and growing and that might not be the case in the future.
