Uchi////The food here is pretty damn good. We ordered the 10-course omakase and a few desserts. The sushi was very, very good and I found the sashimi dishes inspiring (definitely try the hamachi with orange!). My team was a big fan of the fois gras nigiri. The desserts were also excellent, and I especially enjoyed the fried milk desert.
