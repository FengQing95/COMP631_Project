Kata Robata////Two girlfriends and I came here last week for happy hour/dinner and to check the new place out. Warning: happy hour ends at 6:30 pm. Since we arrived shortly after 6, we had to rush and order off the happy hour menu. The waitress was nice, however, and let us order another round of drinks at the happy hour price ($7 a drink) and waited to bring them out until we were finished with the ones we had. The email I had received about this place advertised "street food" stalls on the back patio, which is kept cool with misters, however that wasn't available when I went.
