JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Options for vegetarians and they are extremely accommodating with changes - ie noodles or ingredients and they customize the spicy-ness level. :) some of the best ramen I have had and definitely the most veggie packed. My bowl was filled to the brim with veggies, which I feel like is hard to find. And for such a great price!
