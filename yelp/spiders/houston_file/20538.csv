Uchi////For starts, we ordered the cauliflower tempura (hanna) with ponzu for dipping. I can eat a bowl of that every night. Batter was light and the crunch was just right. I ordered the Norwegian Mackerel hot dish (saba shio). The fish was soft and cooked perfectly. It was a small slab of fish that sat in a small pool of fish sauce (and cucumbers) that had hints of lime. I will never forget that dish. IT was amazing.
