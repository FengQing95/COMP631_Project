Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had the Nashville hot frog legs and the BBQ porchetta sandwich. The frog legs were delicious! Just the right amount of spice and a super crispy exterior. The bartender sold me on the BBQ sandwich. He did not lie. Lots of flavor. The cabbage slaw was great. I normally do not like slaw but this one was not Mayo-y or vinegar-y. I don't know what was in it but it was just the right amount of savory. I also had the BC lemonade. It had just the right amount of heat from the jalape√±os. I def recommend checking them out!
