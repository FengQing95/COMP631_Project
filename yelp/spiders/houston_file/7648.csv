JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is by far, the best ramen spot inside the loop. Service is great and the staff is quite knowledgeable. Make sure your party arrive on time or you'll be waiting because the place gets packed during lunch and dinner hours. The Tonkotsu ramen black was so delicious that I wanted more but I was full after that and having appetizers. They offer high chairs for the little ones and there is a bar in the front if you want to get drinks as you are waiting.
