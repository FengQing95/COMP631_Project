Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is the best place to hang out! They have great pastries and coffee and it's definitely my go to on a Sunday morning. The butter croissant is large and delicious, and the iced coffee I always get it amazing as well. Today (a rainy, not too busy day), it took over 15 minutes to get a simple coffee and the same amount of time for them to bus my obviously gross table from the people before me. Hoping this is just a one-time thing because I do love this place so much!
