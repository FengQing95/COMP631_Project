JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only other Ramen bar I've been to is the original Ramen Tatsuya in Austin so maybe I'm just spoiled. The Ramen was fine. My husband liked his a lot more than I enjoyed mine so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. It was ok but not great. Sunday afternoon so it was pretty crowded - we chose to sit at the bar and the service was fine until we tried to get our check and the bartender/our server had disappeared. I'd try it again but probably order something different.
