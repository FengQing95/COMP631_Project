The Pit Room////This place was bomb. Absolutely loved their bbq. I'm not a bbq queen or anything but the food overall was just delicious and cooked perfectly. They give you samples so make sure you ask for some before you buy! Their lemonade is so good. Just the perfect amount of sour and not so sweet. We got the beef rib (which was huge and a perfect share between two people), the brisket, and the jalape√±o cheese sausage. We got the baked beans and Mac and cheese as sides. The Mac and cheese was too watery for our liking and that was honestly the only reason why I gave them four stars instead of five. Overall I think it's definitely a good spot. Also the sauces they have are really great and the pickled cucumbers are a perfect little addition. Parking is kinda hard to find!
