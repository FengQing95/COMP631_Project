Uchi////Although I do intend to visit Uchi again, in all honesty (as a person who has lived in Japan for 3+ years, and has somewhat established sushi criteria) I felt there are some better values here in Houston. I will keep trying, maybe I will learn to see Uchi's greatness the way other raving Yelpers do.
