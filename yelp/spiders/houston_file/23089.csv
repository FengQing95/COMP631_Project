Uchi////My family had the omakase (a 10 course meal) and after the 10th course we were left still hungry. They are so stingy with their portions and they slice fish so thin you can barely get a full bite with everything on their plate. Being a Japanese-fusion you'd expect sushi or sashimi but we were told that none of the 10 would be sushi or sashimi.... ummmmm WHAT?!?! (We told the server that was unacceptable so she made modifications, I think...? Server was super cool and understanding) The first item was an oyster with honeydew juice. UGH Â it was so gross. It's as if the chef never tried his new dish. And if he did and thought it was good, I would seriously be concerned... those are two flavors that do not mix at all!
