Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I are big foodies and wanted to try something different. We arrived at about lunch time and it was a very chill atmosphere and outlets server, Victor was able to make a couple of recommendations. He also kept us laughing Â when the food arrived, it was hot and taste great! We will be returning soon!
