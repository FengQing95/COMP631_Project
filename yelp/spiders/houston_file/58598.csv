Baby Barnaby's////Arrived in Houston hungry, and found this place after some research. There was a long wait, so we decided to eat outside, where the wait was much shorter.  The food was great!  I never had grits before, and was afraid to try, so the waiter brought me a sample.  Nice sized portions, very tasty.  Hash browns had unique taste, unlike traditional fries. Bacon was ok, at best, but the eggs were filling and unique.
