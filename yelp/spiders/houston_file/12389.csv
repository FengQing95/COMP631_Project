JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the #3 for garlic lovers. This was really good but definitely more than I can finish. There was more pork belly than some of the miso ramens I have ordered in the past so this made for a very filling bowl which I didn't even finish. Everything was definitely flavorful and came out piping hot. We chugged so much water to wash it all down. Megan was our waitress and it was very busy that evening she did her best to check on us. I definitely want to try the dry ramen.
