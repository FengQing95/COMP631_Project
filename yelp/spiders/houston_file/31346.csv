Local Foods////So, after all those yummy pics I went to this place. I ordered the Salmon Sandwich and it was good... I mean ,more like "something different" than delicious but I like it. The place is open and with a great atmosphere, i went with my hubby and we enjoy our quick luch :) Also, this is a nice place to go all by yourself without feeling alone lol.
