Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My husband the pineapple upside down pancakes. We have been several times and it's all he orders. I have had the ham Benedict and just a side order of eggs. All very good. I ordered hot chocolate and wowee! Â I'm pretty picky. I only like it made with milk. It came in a regular sized glass with a huge dollop of whipped cream and some sugar sprinkles that I think were carmalized. Wow it was so good.
