JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We order fresh spinach daily, and throughout the shift our kitchen staff flash boils batches of spinach for use by the ramen chefs. I regret that you disagree with our portion and pricing -- every vegetable that we offer carries a fluctuating price based on market availability and demand. In spite of that, we still charge between $1 and $2.50 for the majority of our toppings.
