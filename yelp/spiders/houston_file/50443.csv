Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The restaurant was packed FULL, but it didn't stop the servers, bartenders, and hostesses from having smiles on their face and giving great service! They have plenty of seating here (large booths, tables, medium booths, the bar seats, and a patio)! If you can't find seating at the bar, you can order drinks while you wait for your table.
