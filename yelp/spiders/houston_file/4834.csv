JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Curtis - Thank you very much for the great review. We appreciate your understanding in regards to our somewhat unconventional seating arrangements. We are a restaurant concept that originated in Japan and whose CEO is native-born Japanese; therefore, much of what we do, not only in terms of our cuisine, is steeped in Japanese hospitality culture.
