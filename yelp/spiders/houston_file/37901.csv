Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time at Bosscat and they didn't disappoint. We had a girls day brunch with mimosas, pork belly tacos, and meatloaf hash. Our server Terry made sure to explain the menu in depth and answer any questions we had. Attentive but not too pushy which is what I look for in service coming from the service industry myself. They have a well priced brunch menu and the mimosas were good. Only negative is the music was a little loud so we had to get close on the table to speak to each other, but the Dj was jammin though. Will definitely visit again!
