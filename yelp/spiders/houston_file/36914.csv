Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was my first time here I came for brunch. We had a table of 8. The Â ambiance was amazing especially if you are whiskey lover like myself!!! The food was delicious..... very creative menu si there was a little bit for everyone.....but thing that taking over the edge was I waiter Terry....he can tell you the menu forwards and backwards!!! The best personality on a waiter half the table cracking up laughing the whole time if you don't come here for anything else at least have a great Waiter on one time in your life and ask for Mr Terry he would treat you right!!!!
