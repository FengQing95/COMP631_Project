Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is an actual gem. The baked items are beautiful works of art and you can't help the temptation as you're going down the line because it was PACKED. I had the chef's choice omelette which was pretty good, but my boyfriend got the chicken and biscuits and OMG there corn bread batter on the chicken is what's up!! I also had a delicious lavender latte that was so delicious I wanted to cry. This place is gorgeous and I wish there was one closer to me. Great menu and high quality experience.
