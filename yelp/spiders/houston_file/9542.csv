JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't get it! I always see a long line here and I just don't get it. The Ramen is waaaay to salty and greasy, its not good at all. I had no issue with the service. There was a loud and obnoxious girl sitting next to us since their layout requires people to sit next to each other which I do not mind but this girl was pushing it. I requested to move to an empty booth and the moved me and my friend. I thought that was nice. Food rating is 1 star, Customer service 5 stars.
