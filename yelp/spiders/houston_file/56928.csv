Kata Robata////Unfortunately, the more "traditional" Japanese items -- basically everything else we ordered -- were good, but nothing to write home about. I was a bit disappointed by the rolls, even though they are simple HH rolls, but I was expecting more flavor and care in them. The toro did not compare to toro I've had at other (out-of-state) places, which was sad because really, fatty tuna should be delicious every single time. The uni didn't taste very fresh, and I have to say MF Sushi's salmon sashimi kicks Kata Robata's butt. But again, I'd chalk it up to an off day for the daily catch.
