Uchi////We went with the vegetarian tasting menu ($60 per person) and were told that it would come with 7 or 8 courses. We were happily surprised when we got 13 different dishes. We got to try more than half of the items of the main vegetarian menu and happy hour menu. Everything was strongly flavored and seasoned to perfection. The -1 star is for the cost of everything. The portion sizes are small, so cost of food quickly adds up.
