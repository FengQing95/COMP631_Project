Local Foods////I actually enjoy eating kale for non-health reasons, so I had no complaints there; however, the chips were deemed to be seasoned with Old Bay, but the Old Bay was a pathetic sprinkle. They were just plain, sad potato chips with the most minimal dusting of Old Bay. Not worth the stomach space.
