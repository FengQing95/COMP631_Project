Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For vegans, I highly recommend trying the tofu scramble with soyrizo, red peppers, and avocado. If you order corn tortillas instead of toast you can make delicious breakfast tacos. My fianc√© loves the scramble with barbacoa, cotija, and avocado, so that's a great option for omnivores. The hashbrowns at Snooze are the best, so definitely be sure and try those while you're there. There are also gluten free pancakes, but unfortunately they're not vegan (please change that, Snooze! Vegan pancakes are super easy to make and better for the planet!). Overall, we love Snooze and will continue to make it a weekly Saturday treat.
