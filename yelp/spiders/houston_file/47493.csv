Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////LOVE this place. The food is amazing, the service is prompt and friendly, and they are very open and happy to take special requests. If you're a nurse, there are certain mornings where booze is half off for those with ID badges/scrubs on. You can get "mimosa" made for you for $6- a MASSIVE glass of champagne with a shot glass of orange juice- yum. I had some amazing classic french toast along with my mimosa and was in bliss. Prices are very reasonable and I plan to come back.
