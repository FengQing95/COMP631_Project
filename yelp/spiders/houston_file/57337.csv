Kata Robata////Kata's small plates are what really made it worth the experience here. Some dishes that stood out for me were the Texas wagyu katsu sando, Texas Kobe beef skewers, yuzu marinated salmon sashimi, and the miso lobster Mac&cheese. These small plates were just *chefs kiss*. I would definitely recommend getting them to try. I was actually kind of disappointed with the miso marinated black cod because the flavor just didn't taste like what it was entailed for. I thought it tasted like more of a teriyaki flavor and that threw me off. The bone marrow to me wasn't anything special but always something photo worthy. I thought that their foie gras was delicious especially on the amberjack dish and on top of the scallops. I thought the fish was up to scale and could see why Kata was peoples favorite sushi restaurant for a while. The nigiri was prepared with a simplistic style so that you could enjoy the fish. With good fish and delicious small plates it is definitely worth a try!
