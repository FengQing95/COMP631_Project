Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond Caf√© & Bakery illustrates everything I believe a good coffee shop and bakery should exhibit. For instance, the entire half of the restaurant is covered in large open windows that allows for a lot of natural light to shine through, and marble tables in neutral colors that fill up every corner of the space. Best of all, their dessert display is breathtaking and extensive. The display case seemed endless with sweet delicacies in an organized presentation, starting with baked pastries to macarons, tarts, cupcakes, and a wall towered with every kind of bread they bake in store. A colossal menu hangs above the glass case and flashes with different menu options.
