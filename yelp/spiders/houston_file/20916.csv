Uchi////Some of the dishes were just Good or OK which is to be expected with a menu this large. Â These included the hamachi nabe (this was one of those "curry + egg + rice in a hot bowl that chars things" dishes and was just "good" like it might be at another such restaurant) the Wagyu special (the beef in this tasted pretty much like other beef and the flavor drowned out the other things that were supposed to be part of the special), and the walu walu (which was "great" but not like the above).
