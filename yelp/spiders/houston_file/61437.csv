Baby Barnaby's////Just had An enjoyable experience at BB's. This is a small cute place with limited parking. There's inside and outdoor sitting. This place had a laid back feel to it that was inviting. The weather was decent so we decided to sit outside. Before I forget, in order to be seated you must sign in on the clipboard and have a seat in the seating area (it took us a while to figure that out). The waiter suggested the Green Egg dish with waffles. The dish comprised of egg,spinach,artichoke heart (mixed in so well that it shouldn't bother you) chicken sausage with potatoes and toast. It was definitely a hearty meal, but for me there was too much going on with this dish for my liking. The waffles were big and I like that you could taste the buttermilk mix. Overall, it was a cool spot. I would definitely recommend BB's if you enjoy trying something different.
