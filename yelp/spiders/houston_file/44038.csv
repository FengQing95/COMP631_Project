Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bike ride had left us hot and tired, so I opted for an iced coffee and lemon tart. Workers behind the counter serve you your pastry on a plate, and you pay for your tab, take a number, and find a place to sit as baristas whip up your drinks and bring them to your table. There is outdoor seating as well as a "bar" esque area where baristas make the drinks, which I thought was very cool.
