The Pit Room////Delicious food! I ordered double beef brisket with mashed potatoes and charro beans. The brisket was definitely delicious and so filling that I actually saved a bit as left overs for the next day--yay! The potatoes were good as well. The beans tasted a bit undercooked and I did not enjoy the taste; I felt like they needed more seasoning or something. They have a variety of different bbq sauces and we went ahead and tried a couple of them. I do find that it is a bit overpriced in my personal opinion, especially with so many other options that are just as good. However, it is a place I would recommend to a friend and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here again!
