JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Omgaah! Finally! An awesome Ramen place in Houston where you WON'T have to wait outside for a table! Went on a Sunday evening and ordered their non-spicy Tonkotsu ramen. Boyfriend and I ordered extra noodles and corn. The noddles are the perfect texture, the broth is rich and flavorful, and the service was great. I had no complaints... except for the large amount of squealing people who absolutely HAD to take pictures of their food before eating it. I guess you can't help it though: presentation is beautiful. Drinks were good and fairly priced.
