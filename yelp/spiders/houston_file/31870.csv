Local Foods////May next visit, I went with the Roast Beef.  This time the bread wasn't the problem, although it was a lackluster simple wheat bread.  There was more kale and marinated vegetables (which was strange) than there was roast beef.  Honestly, the flavor just missed the mark for me and the roast beef that was on the sandwich was not all that tender.
