Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You get the idea. Snooze is a super popular brunch spot that makes you wait. I tend to resist these kind of hyped up places because I feel like often there are similar or even better choices with less hype. And after my first few visits, I kind of felt that way about Snooze. That is until I went to The Morning After brunch festival and tried Snooze's OMG French toast.
