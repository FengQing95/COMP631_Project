Uchi////Every plate a masterpiece. Great mix of flavors. Fish so fresh it melts in your mouth like butter. Great service. Timely delivery of each order. Nice happy hour specials. AND complimentary valet parking across the street in the garage. This place is absolute perfection! Also, they have a phenomenal happy hour--servings are cut in half and prices are too so it's a great opportunity to try more things on the menu without breaking the bank or getting stuffed.
