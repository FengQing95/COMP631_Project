JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkatsu Black (2/5)- The broth was so thick that it had a consistency of paste. I could barely drink it without having to wash it down with water. When i tried to lift the pork chasu with my chopsticks, it fell apart into pieces. The menu showed a picture of an egg that came it; however, i did not receive an egg.
