Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Grilled and soup was amazing. Everything else was underwhelming. Our server Marissa didn't engage with us or even respond verbally when we ordered. She would just walk away and we were left wondering if she even heard us... I don't expect top notch service from this place by any means, but at the bare minimum, I expect to be acknowledged.
