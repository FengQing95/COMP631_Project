The Pit Room////No lines here on Saturday anymore - and I know why.  Perhaps business sold to a different owner, but clearly QA/QC has fallen.  Brisket from the point end (deckle) was tough - how does that happen?  Beans had no flavor and were a bit al-dente, not the way they should be.  And the cole slaw was also not very good.  Needed salt, pepper, and other spices - with an over the top vinegar flavor.  Not good.  If you'd like me to email you a video showing a "pull" test from a slice of the "fatty" or "moist" end of the brisket - let me know.
