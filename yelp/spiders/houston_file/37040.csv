Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The service was great; the food was good. It's definitely different . I don't see myself personally going back as the food options can not be altered to fit your personal liking :/ but I enjoyed the atmosphere and my girls. Didn't understand why we were limited to 2 choices in tables when it was mid day and the place only had about 2 tables taken. We were there 3 hours and no large party came in so this had us all confused. Nevertheless we enjoyed ourselves and the staff was awesome. The 'waterman' was a bit aggressive with wanting to refill even when it was only an inch from the top lol Â but it wasn't a bother just funny.
