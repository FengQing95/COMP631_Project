Uchi////Overall, Uchi was a fantastic experience--the service was friendly, the ambiance was romantic, and many of the dishes were excellent (though others were underwhelming). However, the prices of the small plates of food really added up, and the value probably wasn't the greatest for the amount of food we got. While I might not be in a rush to be back, I definitely left happy and would recommend Uchi for a fun night out.
