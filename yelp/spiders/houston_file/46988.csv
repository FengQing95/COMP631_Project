Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've eaten at Snooze twice recently and had an awesome experience both times. The menu has everything you could want for breakfast/brunch along with delicious cocktails. The service was impeccable and the prices are very affordable. The only downside is that they don't take reservations and parking can be a hassle. It's quickly become a go-to of my mine and I look forward to going back again soon. FYI: The Benny Duo w/hash browns are unreal! :-)
