Kata Robata////For those happy-hour loving fans - this one should be on your list as a best bet.  Though I wish there was sushi included in the happy hour menu (that runs daily - not just monday - friday) - you do get to check out a variety of geat robata, sushi roll and other items plus drinks and japanese beers at a not-to-be-missed price in the bar area.  All served w/ great friendliness, knowledge and ambiance.(My faves: the grilled oyster mushrooms which come with benito flakes that move for entertainment and the fresh fish ceviche of the day - but others swear by their sushi rolls)
