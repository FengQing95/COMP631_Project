Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Determined to have a good time, my friends and I ordered the CHILAQUILES BENEDICT, BENNY GOODMAN, BELLA! BELLA! BENNY, CAPRESE BENEDICT (ala the Benny Duo! a fantastic deal if you can't decide on just one), OMG! FRENCH TOAST, SANDWICH I AM, and the PANCAKE OF THE DAY (strawberry cheesecake, I think?). Everyone was extremely pleased and were basically raving about the food all day. (Pro tip: ask for your hashbrowns to be flat and crispy). Additionally, the incredibly sweet waitress brought us PANCAKE FLIGHT of PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN, PEANUT BUTTER CUP, and BLUEBERRY pancakes for my friend's birthday.
