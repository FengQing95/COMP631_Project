Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////But the star of the show was the desert!!!! My friend had the fried apple pie with ice cream and the look on her face when she took the first bite spoke for it self and I could not wait to eat my desert. I had a toffee cake with a sauce, pecans and whipped cream I can't think of the name but all I will tell you if you don't order this you are doing yourself a disservice. Â I asked my waiter about it and he told me it was the owner John mother's recipe. So I will end this review saying thank you to Johns Mother I have never had a desert like that. Oh yea and thank you too John! We will definitely be back.
