The Pit Room////Some of the BBQ was good, some of it was overly fatty with little meat. I'm going 2 star because the staff were nice, but they need to step up their game when it comes to food/Value. We ordered what I believe was the largest offering on the Menu, a variety for $135. Reading what was included looked like a good value,  but only providing 6 tiny sides for something that's suppose to feed "6-8" people is a pretty stupid business model.  Does person #7 and #8 just not get sides?
