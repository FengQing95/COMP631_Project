Uchi////Last night we had Van at the sushi bar, in charge of our food. We basically told him to send us whatever he thought, and we LOVED everything. Our favorites were the walu walu, some striped jack dish (hamachi family), wagyu beef sushi, and we ALWAYS get the fried milk. He got us to try so many things that I would never think to order. It is truly a fun experience.
