Kata Robata////In terms of comparison to other Japanese restaurants and their omakase... I've really only had omakase here and at MF Sushi. I can't compare which one was better, because they were both very different. If you are looking at pure sushi omakase, I would recommend MF just because they focus so much on the basic flavor of the fish. If you're looking for some sushi and some traditional Japanese dishes, come to Kata Robata. Quality of the food is superb at both places.
