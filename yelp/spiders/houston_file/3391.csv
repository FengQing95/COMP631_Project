JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I eat out daily. It's no secret I love good food. After 20 yrs of being in the Houston area, I found a hidden gem. Absolutely perfect! Â It was a business lunch so we ordered 7 different appetizers. All delicious. Can't tell you which one was best because it is a tie!! Spicy noodle dish was superb. Will definitely be back soon after i get someone to roll me out to my car!
