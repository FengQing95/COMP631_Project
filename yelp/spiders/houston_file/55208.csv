Kata Robata////Great sushi! The sushi was fresh and everything was good. If you are concerned about gluten they have little stars by the food that is gluten free and most played can be made to be gluten free. The soy sauce I the table is gluten free as well. Sake was good and a great wine list. Our waitress was super helpful with all questions and even added some input of her own. Over all it was a really great experience and I can't wait to go back.
