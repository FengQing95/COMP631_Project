Baby Barnaby's////I highly recommend the Green Eggs plate--two eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke hearts and jack cheese, chicken apple sausage, and cubed, fried potatoes.  This and the self-serve carafe of coffee on the table put some pep in my step.  Though ensconced in smaller quarters than Barnaby's, the place did not feel crowded. The waitstaff also couldn't be more efficient and nice (another reason I am returning).
