Baby Barnaby's////Super tasty! Randomly picked this place for Saturday breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. I was hungry and got French toast & the pink and white scramble. I only ate the scramble while I was in the restaurant. It was regular tasting but food! Buttttt those potatoes....fire. Sooo tasty! So brown. So good. I also got the fresh squeezed OJ. It was okay, probably won't be getting that again. The French toast smelled heavenly.
