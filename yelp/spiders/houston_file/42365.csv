Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////OK, the reason why I'm giving this 2 stars is because of the overinflated prices (but also their less than ample parking availability) but also my last experience there was quite subpar. I was on my way to my friend's house Saturday evening and ran in there to pick up a few cookies and macarons to bring over. The gentleman behind the counter was pleasant, I ordered 4 cookies and a dozen macarons. It was boxed up quickly. I went to pay and the girl behind the register chatted w me about the coldbrew coffee in the can, and asked me if I wanted to try it. I laughed and said I couldn't handle coffee at 6pm, I would stay up all night. She rang me up. $45. Yikes. I should've just picked up a cake from HEB for $15! Anyway, I paid and walked over to pick up the boxes. The girl goes to the guy behind the counter, loudly, so that I could hear, "SHE DIDN'T TIP." whilst looking sideways at me as if to make a point for me to hear. I was shocked that she said something like that. He looked up apologetically at me and said to hear quietly, "well, it's fine, it's a carry-out." I almost felt bad for him - not because I didn't tip for putting cookies in a box - but because I probably could have spared a few bucks b/c he was nice about it but I didn't have any change. I despise, the most, people thinking that tips are required. And, moreover, if I were to tip my standard 20% (which I almost always do when I sit down and eat where I have people actually serving me) that would amount to nearly $10. FOR PUTTING COOKIES IN A BOX. I'd rather tip at Starbucks where the baristas actually have to make the coffee for me and where it's not expected nor demanded.
