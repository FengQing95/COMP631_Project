Kata Robata////The slow cooked Texas kobe beef skewer was outstanding and hands down my favorite dish.  The meat was so tender and flavorful it practically melted in your mouth.  We could have easily made a meal out of just this.  My fiance favored the miso-crusted bone marrow, which was also amazing (and a very generous portion).  I'd also highly recommend the toro and short rib sushi roll.  It was so rich and flavorful, it didn't even need soy sauce.  This was probably one of the best rolls I've had...ever.
