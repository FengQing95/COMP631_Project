Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is the tricky part. Common Bond does have a parking lot for its customers (around 2 dozen or so spots), but it can fill up really quickly during rush hour. You can park on the street of any of the neighborhoods, but sometimes those fill up quickly as well. Don't give up though! I promise you the food is worth it. Also, make sure you DO NOT park in Common Bond's parking lot after hours, or if you're not going to eat there. They will tow you.
