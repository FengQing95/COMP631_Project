JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Julia - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you decided to try us out. Do you remember which ramen you ordered? We offer several types of Tonkotsu ramen with different soup bases (Tonkotsu Black, Tonkotsu Spicy, Spicy Miso Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu Assari). Our Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha use our thickest broth and some guests have found it too rich for their liking. Our Tonkotsu Spicy and Miso Tonkotsu use our medium-based broth with a half-and-half mixture of pork broth and a light clear veggie/chicken broth. Â
