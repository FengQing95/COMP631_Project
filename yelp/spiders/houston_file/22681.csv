Uchi////This place is the real deal. Everything from service, presentation, and taste was amazing. Best meal I've ever had at a restaurant. Can't wait to go back. We sat at the bar and Matt (bartender) took care of us. Can't recommend this fella enough. Witty and knowledgeable. Wine,beer, & sake only. No liquor. I can't remember many of the names for the dishes...doesn't matter...all great. Â We had about 18 or so plates. Expect to spend some money. For us, worth every dollar and then some.
