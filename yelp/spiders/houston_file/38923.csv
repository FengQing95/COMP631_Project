Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had the Friday evening special which was a mixture of crab and cheese dip combined and it was incredible. I felt pretty full when our other items came. Skip the sweet potato mac & cheese and order the fried potato salad instead. I also recommend the Pulled Pork Hush Puppies and make sure to dip it in the sauce. The sauce is everything!
