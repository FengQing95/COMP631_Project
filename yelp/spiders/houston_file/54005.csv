Kata Robata////Spicy soy ramen: Mediocre. I had read so much about this inventive ramen, and I was disappointed with my experience. The soy-based broth was a little sweet, which was off-putting, and the ground pork lent an unpleasantly course texture to the dish. The noodles themselves were solid, however, with a good bit of chew as any proper ramen noodle should.
