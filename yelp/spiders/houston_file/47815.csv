Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went here on a Tuesday and the line moved very quick. Took about 15 minutes to get seated. I tried their OMG French toast and it was amazing! I also recommend the benedict with salmon in it. Second time I went was on a Sunday so the wait was about an hour. Tried the flight pancake dish and that was just as amazing!
