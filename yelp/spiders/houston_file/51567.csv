Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I chose to get a combo Benedict of the chile verde benny and the Bella Bella benny. Loved the chile verde one, but the Bella one just didn't hit my palette the way I wanted. The chile verde was a perfect combo of sweet, salty and spicy and it was a serious flavor explosion in my mouth. Maybe I didn't dig the other one as much bc I ate the chile verde first.
