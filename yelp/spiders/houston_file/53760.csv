Kata Robata////Big fan after my first experience there. Went at 5:45 on a Friday night and had no trouble finding a seat or parking. The decor was modern, clientel was classy without pretension, and the chef takes a progressive approach to preparing fresh fish and grilled items in an artist manner. I appreciate the attention to detail and extra creature comforts. Even the ginger is fresh, and they have a house-made low sodium soy sauce.
