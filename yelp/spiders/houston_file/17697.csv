Uchi////Some details. We put ourselves at our waiters mercy since we were newbies. We told him we liked the tasting menu, and so he suggested that he would mostly follow the official tasting menu, but would, without permission deviate a bit. And it worked out extremely well. We had about 8 courses, and 3 glasses of wine (three different types), and all were great. I found it interesting that they had waiters and servers, and teh servers were very knowledgable themselves, which speaks volumes about teh training they must receive.
