Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was here to Tate some of their home made desserts and I must tell you that it did not disappoint me. The pistachio croissant was one of a kind. The service is quick. They have a small cute patio and have decent seating inside.they have a private lot so parking should not be a problem. It is a pet and kid friendly place.
