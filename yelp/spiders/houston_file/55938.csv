Kata Robata////The food is amazing but the service exceeds what I believed to be the best service. Tai (I am probably misspelling this) was our waiter and did a spectacular job, water was never less than half filled before being poured; appetizers were brought promptly and the courses were staggered appropriately to provide the perfect environment.... so thank you Kata Robata, and Tai for the great experience.
