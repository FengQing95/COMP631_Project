Kata Robata////We decided last minute to try this restaurant and we were able to get 6:30 resos the same day we called, granted it was a Monday, but by the time we left the restaurant was completely full. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious! We had the crunchy eel roll and the rising sun roll. I had never had truffles with sushi but it was really exceptional. They have a great happy hour which drastically reduced our bill, for example the tuna tartar is only $8 rather than $15. Definitely recommend!
