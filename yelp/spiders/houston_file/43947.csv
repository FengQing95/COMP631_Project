Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The view and smells of the pastries are breath-taking and eye-catching.  I have yet to see a croissant so large yet anywhere in Houston.  The croissants are large, fluffy, buttery and flakey; the chocolate is full of chocolaty goodness.  The fruit croissants - one has raspberry jam and almond & pistachio filling - the other is a delicious chocolate cherry dusted with powdered sugar.  My ultimate favorite addiction is the Kouign Amman - so rich, buttery and full of caramelized sugar goodness; I have never had a pastry so good and so bad all in one bite, lol.  The Kuglehopf is a very interesting little Bundt cake that is sweet, moist and full of sweet fruits.  The Bostok is a French toast type pastry and is very crisp and very sweet from the powdered sugar and has crisp almonds; I will admit this was not my fave.
