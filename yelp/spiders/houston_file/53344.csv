Kata Robata////I use to work literally down the street from this place.  So when it first opened, we would go about once a week for lunch.  We always got the bento boxes (so much food).  It came with beef rib eye (a bit chewy sometimes), salmon, shrimp tempura, or sashimi.  The box included a california roll or rice, seaweed salad + shumai, agedashi tofu, chicken teriyaki with broccoli, and cake (it would change, strawberry, coffee, vanilla, always a surprise).  And you get your choice of miso soup or salad...I think they say miso soup cost extra, but we've never been charged.
