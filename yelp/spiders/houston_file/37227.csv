Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been trying to make it to Bosscat for quite some time now and finally had a chance today for lunch.  Location is good, right off of Westheimer with valet parking.  Restaurant was dark and much more of a bar atmosphere.  Food was just okay.  I had the chicken and corn chowder and my lunch guest had the tomato bisque - unfortunately, neither was something I would return to eat again.  The brussel sprouts were mushy and had lots of cheese and bacon piled on top - just not that appealing and not much taste. The Cornbread Madeleines with Huckleberry sweet cream butter were the only highlight of this lunch.  Looks like they have a pretty extensive beer and cocktail menu though.  Maybe I'll go back for drinks and appetizers and update my review then.
