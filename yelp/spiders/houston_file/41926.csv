Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wife and I come inside at 2:54pm. There are exactly three customers in front of us in line and FOUR retail clerks behind the counter - all looking very busy. For five minutes we stand there wondering why three of the four clerks look busy but aren't managing to take any new orders... and we realize that they are all occupied with... boxing unsold macaroons (not sure if they were doing this to sell them the next day or because "the boss' cousin" wanted a box ASAP to impress a date - whatever). Finally, at 2:59pm, I am asked what I want, and I order two cappuccinos, a $4 cake muffin, and a $3.00 bagel (a byaly, technically) with cream cheese. The clerk's response? "The kitchen closes at three o'clock and so you can't have the cream cheese." Really? Not only do we have to stand here and pretend that we don't mind when no one cares to take our order... Not only are you in a hurry to close your kitchen before 3pm... Not only do you not give a rat's tail about looking good in front of your customer or your boss... But you also have the decency to claim that as of 2:59pm your supposed "closed kitchen" doesn't have the "technical resources" to scoop up a tablespoon of cream cheese to sell your last stale bagel that some customer #actually# wants to buy for three dead presidents? YOU PEOPLE ARE MENTAL. CHANGE THE BLOODY STREET SIGN: IT SHOULD READ THIS: Â "McDonalds"
