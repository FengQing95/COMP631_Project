Local Foods////I cannot say enough good things about Local Foods. Only downside is that finding parking can be hard during normal meal hours as Local is so popular! My friends and I love coming here when we want a nice, delicious but also healthy meal out. It's within walking distance of other Rice Village shops and really close to the university. I love the interior of the restaurant (the decor, the lighting, the colors, everything) not to mention the AMAZING food. My personal favorite is the garden sammie as a salad with chicken added. I literally am drooling just thinking about it (the blend of the curried cauliflower, the pickled onion, the hummus spread all together in the salad is to die for)...please try it!!! I also love all of the sides or the house soup that come with a sandwich order, but if I had to choose, I'd recommend the tuscan kale and red potato salad. Other menu items that I've tried and raved about are the truffled egg salad sandwich, the spring harvest salad, and the asian chicken salad. I know that people usually think someplace with as many good reviews as Local Foods is overrated, but believe me, it's not.
