Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yes, it was a 75 to 90 minute wait this past Saturday morning but I had been waiting weeks to find the time to dine here. It was a wonderful end to an early morning and I couldn't have been more happy with the outcome. My fiancee and I dined on the Egg White Fritta (off of the Like a Feather portion of the menu) and he had The Snooze Classic. It was incredibly well made and delicious didn't even come close to expressing the taste factor. The waitstaff was top notch, very knowledgeable about the menu and what was available. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be coming back soon!
