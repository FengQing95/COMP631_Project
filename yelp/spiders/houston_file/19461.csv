Uchi////We ordered the 10 courses tasting menu. There were absolutely no hot tasting dish. They were all cold dish with many cerviche type chopped fish. Almost all of them tasted similar with fish source and lime juice blend in. If the fish were fresh, you do not even need so much seasoning to cover them. Portion was ridiculously Small....we had ordered the same in Austin and they were completely different. It had combination of hot and cold entree. When I complained to the manager about no hot tasting dish in the course, they offered shrimp tempura and Brussels spout.....Please keep in mind, these were $200 tasting menu, so I expected at least couple of real hot tasting dish, not hot appetizer! I appreciate the manager made the offer, but overall, Houston Uchi was a total ripped off, please try the new Rokka Japanese restaurant close to greenway plaza. Nights and days, at least they serve real food!
