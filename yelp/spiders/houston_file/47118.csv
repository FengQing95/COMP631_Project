Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In Houston for the week. Woke up hungry and started searching Yelp for a good breakfast place. Snooze came up, looked interesting and had good reviews. To say this place is popular is an understatement. We had to circle around the neighborhood for a while to score a parking spot. At check in we were told the wait was 45-60 mins. We decided to wait and glad we did. I got a complementary coffee from the waiting area and we monitored the counter seating for about 20 mins before 2 spots opened up. The morning margarita was slamming good as was the Mexican medium roast coffee. I had the heuvos rancheros and my wife had the barbacoa eggs benedict. Â Both of our meals were super delicious. The staff was rocking and totally on top of it. I would give this place 10 stars if I could.
