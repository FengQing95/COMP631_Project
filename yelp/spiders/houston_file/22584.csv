Uchi////Perhaps my favourite single dish in the Omakase was a Straw mushroom nigiri which was incredibly flavourful; basted with a thin film of brown butter. Â Good mushrooms are to die for, and the flavour combination reminds me of my favourite meals of shimeji back in the day in LA (Place - I miss you!).
