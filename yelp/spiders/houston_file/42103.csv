Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So far my favorite brunch menu plate was the Crab Chile Relleno, which will have me coming back for it again. This was well worth the $11.00 paid. The Egg Salad sandwich was good also, but not as great as the Crab Relleno.  I was not too impressed by the pastries, but I will definitely give it another try soon.
