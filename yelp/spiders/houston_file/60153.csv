Baby Barnaby's////We split the Annie's low-fat burrito. Holy cow it was amazing. I'm not the healthiest eater and not really a fan of beans but the person that picked the meal was, so I also ordered a side of potatoes. I was wrong, that burrito was insane. I opened it up and started to pick out things to see where each flavor was coming from. The beans!!! The thing I don't like had such a great seasoning it made the burrito. What a great surprise.
