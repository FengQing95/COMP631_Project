Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now as I had it saved to my collections. The server told us on sundays they have a huge brunch with a Dj that I would love to check out. Our food was good the side dishes of Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese I would recommend both rich in flavor and the Mac is really creamy. The lettuce wraps were good, burger was full of flavor and juicy, my daughter liked the pasta but felt like the sauce was too overwhelming. Other than that great service great food. Can't wait to try Sunday funday.
