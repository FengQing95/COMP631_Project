Baby Barnaby's////I subtracted a star because when I went in last time the bench had skewed up to a table, and as I was trying to correct it the waitress yelled from across (the admittedly small) room, "that's just how they are, you can't move them, if you need more room sit over there," which I internalized to mean that I am slightly larger than Jabba the Hut and I should sit outside so that my weight doesn't collapse the Resteraunt.
