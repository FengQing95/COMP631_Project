Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for a late lunch and drinks with my boss and friend. First time for all of us. Based off the first hour we were there I would've given this place 5 stars. After our bartender closed us out Bc of shift change, things went down hill quick. Food is okay. Nothing special about anything. Just average food. Our first bartender made really good drinks. Our second bartender's drinks were too sweet compared to how it was made previously. Another bartender came up to us and told us we had to sit at the back of the restaurant and couldn't sit at the bar anymore Bc it was reserved. Wouldn't have been an issue if there was a sign or someone notifying us about this party earlier. Instead of kicking us out or pushing us to the back. We opted to close out our tab and finish up our drinks and move on to the next stop. But we couldn't even do that. If we wanted to finish our drinks we had to go to the back of the restaurant as well. My boss was not happy with how they approached him and we will not be back.
