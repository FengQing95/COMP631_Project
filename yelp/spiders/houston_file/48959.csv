Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////On to the food! We got 2 pancake samplers, so we were able to try almost ALL of their offerings.  My favorite was the OMG french toast, the cheese just put it over the top, the Drunk Monkey french toast, was similar to banana nut bread, our pancake of the day was some kind of tropical twist? it was delicious! sweet potato was ok, the pineapple upside down was also spectacular.
