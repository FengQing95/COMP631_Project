Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friends all got the Bosscat burger chef's style and they raved about it. I had a bite and liked it a lot. But come on, I got the shrimp and grits and it made my evening. The entire top of the dish was covered in shrimp and I was able to get shrimp in every single bite. There was a good amount of spice to the dish but it didn't take away from any of the flavor. The grits themselves were the right amount of creamy and complemented the shrimp and the spice so well.
