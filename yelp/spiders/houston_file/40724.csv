Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Absolutely awesome spot. Came into town on a tour (I do music) and this was the cap to my Texas run. Bosscat was exactly what I was looking for. Awesome food, great whiskey, knowledgeable service, clean bathrooms, GOOD HOT SAUCE, etc etc etc. Fries are phenomenal and I can highly recommend the chicken dip app and the chicken sandwich. Great casual spot in Galleria. Will definitely be back. Thanks Matt for the fantastic hospitality!
