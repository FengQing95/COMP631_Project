JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////-My only complaint here is that the bowls don't come with an egg. You order it separately and its a whole egg. I like biting into half an egg and not a whole one, let alone it being a cold egg. That was weird for me so maybe next time I'll ask them to give me half an egg and the other half to my accompaniment. Also the egg tasted like coffee to me, is that weird? It just wasn't my night for the egg so I didn't finish eating it.
