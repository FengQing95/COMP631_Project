Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We had breakfast here on Dec 24th. I had the sausage and egg sandwich, my husband had steak and eggs, and the kids had some desserts. The pastries were the only good things. Hubby's steak was pathetic, my sandwich tasted okay but little did I know how awful it actually was. Few hours later I got violently sick and kept getting sick with diarrhea well into Christmas day. Thank you for screwing up my Christmas.
