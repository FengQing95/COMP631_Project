Uchi////My waitress was Victoria. She was super attentive and caring. Multiple times did she come by to ask if we enjoyed our food and if we were okay. Since I came to Uchi not knowing what to get, so Victoria recommended the Omakase which was just a 10 course variety of different dishes. The Omakase was very splendid and delicious. It was a surprise for every plate I had.
