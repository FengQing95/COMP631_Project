Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze Snooze Snooze, is bomb bomb bomb. Love this place. You wait about an hour or more on the weekend but the food definitely makes up for it . And the staff is so nice that you forget that you just waited an hour. Literally they brought us the best blueberry pancakes I have ever had in my life free of charge just for our wait. Our waitress was so amazing and made our experience there so good. My fianc√© had a breakfast burrito and he loved it and I had French toast which was also amazing. Highly recommend this place, just be prepared to wait. Girls make sure you wear flats.
