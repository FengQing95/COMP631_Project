Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was great, but overshadowed by our service experience. Very poor service by management and our immediate server. It must have been one of their family members or friends that came in and sat next to us because we were completely ignored as they continued to stay at their table. This would normally not bother me so much except it took over an hour for food, and they were celebrating that one was not of age to drink and yet was drinking mimosas. Im guessing thats why the service suffered- they are busy drinking. Not pleased, and will not go back to this location. Management needs to get it together as this is not the first time ive heard this complaint. Only 3 stars so it doesnt get deleted.
