Uchi////I came here with the knowledge that the sushi BAR was part of well the BAR, and that I was able to walk in and sit there, after standing for an hour on heels, finally a space at the bar was open and I was asked to moved because it wasn't part of the BAR even though it's called sushi BAR and it's not a table like the rest, I think that's BS because that's not what I was told, I think that they should've explained themselves better when I called, if they would've told me that, I wouldn't have waited all this time, poor communication at this place, never coming back, waste of time
