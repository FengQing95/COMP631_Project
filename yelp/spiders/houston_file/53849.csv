Kata Robata////Kata Robata has a deserved reputation as one of the best Japanese restaurants in Houston.  The interior is spare, warm and earthy-think browns, tans, stained wood with intimate lighting. We ordered the mountainous sashimi for two, duck dumpling shoyu ramen, and the foie gras and duck soba noodles. I loved the soft boiled egg in the ramen because the yolk contributed richness to the soup. The vegetables brought some crunch and freshness while the dumpling added substance.  The sashimi was good but the flavors of were a little too delicate- perhaps because a waiter stated that the items were farm raised and my palate is now accustomed to seafood caught in the wild with a more vibrant essence.  I was pleased that neither the normally heavy duck or foie gras overwhelmed the soba- the trio were cohesive in their subtlety.  The service was impressive and precise.  After accidentally dropping my chopsticks, my attendant handed me a new one before i could think about asking for another pair. Now that's customer service.
