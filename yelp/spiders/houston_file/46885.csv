Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went a while back on a weekday morning. I arrived around 7am and by the time I left the line and parking lot were crazy. The staff were nice--they tag your order with your name, which does feel more personal. My biggest issue was the food. I ordered the pancake sampler (you choose any three pancakes from their crazy list of options). I love pancakes and was super excited, but all of the pancakes were WAY too sweet and all came covered in syrups/glazes that were just overwhelming. If you had blindfolded me and told me it was cake, I still would have said it was too sugary. If that's your jam, go forth and be happy. Otherwise, steer clear of the pancakes and try to go early to avoid the crowds.
