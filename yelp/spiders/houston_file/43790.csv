Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kouign amann - caramelized on the outside which is great, but way too greasy. My friend and I split this and I still couldn't finish my half because of how greasy it tasted. I've tried the one from New York (Dominique ansel bakery) and unfortunately this one doesn't compare taste wise (unfortunately it did price wise, and I thought houston is suppose to be cheaper than New York...). 2.5/5
