JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here for lunch and I have to say I was amazed. I heard a lot of good stories about this place from co-workers. To my surprise they are not lying. So got the Sprouting up Ramen. The ramen was delicious and I have to say its way better than the one in Vancouver. First bit of the brussel sprouts and I was like wow. The taste was very rich and I can taste the sake flavor. . I tasted a rich flavor. There were a lot of brussel sprouts in my bowl. Â Loved it.
