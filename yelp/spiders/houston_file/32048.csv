Local Foods////This is one of my favorite spots in Houston! I came here for the first time in November 2013 and have been coming at least 2x per month since! I am a vegetarian and recommend the falafel sandwich and market veggie sandwich.  I have tried many of the sides, my favorites are the kale and house made chips!  The mint aid is very good and the staff is friendly! Definitely a must try for lunch or casual dinner.  I am also a fan of the decor in the restaurant!
