Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally, the service was great. As crazy and chaotic as it was, the bartender (can't remember her name, but ADORABLE red-head), was super chill and fun. She gave us samples of other drinks and beers, as she effortlessly took care of other patrons eating at the bar, Â just ordering drinks, and the servers getting drinks for their tables. She smiled the entire time, and engaged in conversation. She made us feel welcome.
