Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite non-sweet thing there is the salmon tartine... it's a great brunch or lunch item. Simple, yet the flavors of smoked salmon, chopped hard boiled egg, green onion, capers, and onions on bread meld together so well. It's light enough to enjoy a sweet treat afterwards as well.
