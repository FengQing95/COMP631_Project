Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This was my first visit to this location.   My daughter and I dropped in for a late breakfast.   We were seated immediately.   Our server Jordan came over, we asked a couple questions about the menu then he went got us waters.  We ordered when he returned to our table.   My daughter had the spud and her 2 toppings were bacon and spinach, I ordered the Snooze classic breakfast with Turkey sausage.   Our food came out rather quickly, delivered by another server.   The food was delicious except a small mishaps... my 10 year old asked for no onions .  Our server didn't come to our until 10 minutes after the food was delivered but he immediately noticed the onions and offered to remake.   He said he would remake quick, but he didn't seen too attentive to our table so much daughter kept flicking the onions to the side.   Halfway thru the meal, my daughter drank all get water, I gave her mine.   Jordan never came back to our table until we were done eating.   He didn't even bring the check until I waved him down.   So the food was good but service on this day a little slow.
