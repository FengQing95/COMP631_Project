Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Virgin to Bosscat for lunch but I will definitely be back. The ambiance was eclectic and upscale. Rustyn was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and had a great personality. He's very attentive! Go check him out at the bar! My food was seasoned to perfection and I'll definitely be back.
