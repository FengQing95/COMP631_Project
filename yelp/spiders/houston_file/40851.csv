Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Anyway, everything was great, unique flavors, served hot, presented well and hearty. It was Valentine's Day so it was fairly packed. I have to add that I'm visiting from out of town but felt so at home at this restaurant, the manager and his wife were so friendly, funny and welcoming. He checked on our table and ensured service was amazing and it definitely was. ( thanks Ava) I will come back here again and can't wait until the entire menu is available. This is definitely a new favorite for me! Can't wait for my next visit!! Make sure to visit this spot, it's a must. Ohhhh and the atmosphere is so chic, rustic and trendy. Perfect for couples, family, friends and private events.
