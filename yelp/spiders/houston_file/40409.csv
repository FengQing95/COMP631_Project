Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Love the food and the vibe.  The place is a little hard to find but once you get there it is worth the trip.  The Chef's choice burger was excellent and the fries were cut thick.  The service was really amazing and it really felt like an old school pub.  The prices are a little high to justify 5 stars but it was a great place to have a solid meal.
