JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Joyce - Thank you for your review and valuable feedback. I regret that you had a negative experience at our restaurant. First, may I ask if you can remember which date and approximate time you dined at our Midtown location? I would like to speak to the server in question who made you feel rushed. That is unacceptable. We are always seeking to find the perfect medium between keeping our tables turning without rushing our customers.
