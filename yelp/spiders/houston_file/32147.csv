Local Foods////Pretzel bread, with chips and chicken and lettuce and tomatoes inside. I think I was expecting my sandwich to be warm (since the bread was toasted and cheese was melted) so when I took my first big bite I was a little disappointed to find cold chicken. Also, they ran out of chips! I'm sure there was a stash for the sandwich, but there weren't any chips remaining for my side. So I got the kale, and the quinoa. The kale wasn't too bitter and the quinoa was a little too acidic for my taste. Moral of the story? Get there early enough to have chips with your sandwich instead.
