Uchi////This is one of my favorite Japanese places in Houston and they had my most favorite dessert in all of Houston as well- Fried Milk! Well just like how a lot of things have changed on their menu, the fried mild has changed as well. No longer a powdery, ice cream heaven with the perfect salty crunch, it's now a more bland, melty version with a bigger crunch. Bring back the old Fried Milk UCHI!
