Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Overall, the food was decidedly average. Though well prepared and presented, the flavors did not compliment each other. The poutine was delicious, but that honestly was the highlight of the meal. The beef carpaccio was served with a cucumber salad on top, which overpowered any flavor of beef - personally something dry like arugula would compliment the beef better than cucumber. The pork loin, steak, and beef Wellington all had similar issues, as all three were served with a syrup-sweet glaze on top. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but way too much glaze was added, which ended up overpowering any other flavor and resulted in entrees that were more sweet than anything else. The sides that were included were quite good, though none of us really liked the polenta that was included with the pork. The restaurant had a set menu when we went, which we thought was a really good deal and one that I would recommend - a 4 course meal for $50 that included a choice of an appetizer (carpaccio for us), a wedge salad, a choice of an entree (beef Wellington), and a whiskey cheesecake.
