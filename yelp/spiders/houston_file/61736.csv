Baby Barnaby's////Onto the food: the breakfast is delish. I thought I was just getting a simple order of pancakes with chicken sausage and eggs but it was no ordinary flapjack. It was fluffy and huge! Definitely couldn't eat it all but it was yummy. Also loved that they fresh squeezed juice to order...nice touch. Barnaby's seems to be scattered about the city but this was one of my favorite experiences.
