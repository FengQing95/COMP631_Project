Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had Henry serve us recently for my sister in law's birthday dinner and he was so kind & attentive! He made sure we were educated with the menu and was so patient when we were indecisive. The food here, ya'll... just go try it out for yourself. Everything may seem small at first look but trust me, I can never get through half of my meal without having a huge food baby and same for anyone I've ever taken here! For appetizers, the cornbread Madeline's are my favorite! Something about that huckleberry cream butter with sea salt that just makes me so happy. I usually always get the shrimp & grits as my main meal, so creamy & the shrimp is always fresh. It also has the perfect amount of spice to it too.
