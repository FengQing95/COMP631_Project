Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I visited on a Wednesday night and it was a great experience. The whiskey room is impressive and the drinks are tasty! For dessert we tried the churros and it was delicious and hot! I just moved to Houston and for some odd reason, the restaurants I've visited like to serve warm food.. I have no idea what that's about. Ask for Chase at the bar, exceptional service. I'll be back.
