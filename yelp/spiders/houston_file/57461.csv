Kata Robata////Came here for the first time for my boyfriend & I's anniversary and was not disappointed! The restaurant is very clean and has a nice ambiance. Our server, Stephanie, took lovely care of us while our stay. All the dishes that we ordered were amazing!! The Mac and cheese dish was very filling and such a large portion for the price. We also ordered the matcha cheesecakes for desert to wrap it all up! Everything was amazingly delicious and we will be back!!
