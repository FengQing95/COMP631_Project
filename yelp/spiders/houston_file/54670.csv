Kata Robata////The sushi I had was really great, maybe even exceptional. It was pricey for small portion sizes, but that's typical for any sushi restaurant. The reason I am downgrading my rating of this restaurant is because of its poor service. We waited nearly 15 minutes before a waiter asked us our order, and another 35 minutes for one rice dish to arrive. Getting the check and receiving the receipt took very long too, and we were even brought the wrong check by a different waitress than had been serving us. Management at Kata Robata should really consider investing in more staff, so its patrons can really enjoy the food here.
