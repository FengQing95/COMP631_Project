Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////1. Shrimp & Grits- They make the BEST grits ever. It's so cheesy, creamy, flavorful, and has the perfect consistency. I only eat grits from Snooze. It has kind of a cajun taste because of the andouille sausage and spices they add. They also don't skimp on the shrimp and cook the shrimp perfectly.
