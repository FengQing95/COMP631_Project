JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Thanh - Thank you for your review. We greatly appreciate your feedback. I would argue that our prices are competitive not only within the market for our specialized cuisine, but also within the market for restaurants in Midtown in general. And while you have stated that you probably won't visit us again, I do appreciate your kind words otherwise, and wish you all the best.
