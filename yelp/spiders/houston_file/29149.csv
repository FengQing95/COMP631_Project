The Pit Room////I guess my overall view was a little disappointed because I was really hoping the brisket would be tasty, but it was just drier than I expected and that made it a little hard to eat with the bread without overwhelming it with bbq sauce. They also charge extra for more bread, which is a bummer since other places don't do that but oh well.
