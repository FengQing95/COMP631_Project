Baby Barnaby's////Best place for breakfast! The green eggs are absolutely amazing. I just recently moved to this neighborhood and Baby Barnaby's is definitely a go to at least twice a week. Great food, good coffee and amazing atmosphere. If you have family or friends in town I would highly suggest bringing them here! Baby Barnaby's is awesome! Keep up the great work!
