Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My girlfriend dragged me kicking and screaming all the way from The Woodlands to the Common Bond Cafe & Bakery. Upon arriving, I had to apologize for complaining because this place was amazing. The coffee is awesome, the oatmeal cream pies were outstanding, and the breakfast was out of this world. I really wish it was closer to us so we could visit more.
