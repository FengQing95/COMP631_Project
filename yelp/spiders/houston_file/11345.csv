JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ever since I've tried this place, I've always come back with out of town friends! This is the first place I always want to go to with my friends because the ramen never disappoints! All of their food on their menu is delicious so whatever you get will ALWAYS be great! I always get their #2 Spicy Chicken Ramen with extra noodles, eggs and bean sprouts with an Innu(?) Tofu Pudding for dessert! The Tofu pudding definitely cleans my taste buds and makes me want more ramen! Their curry with rice is definitely delicious and I love their fried Kale chips as well! I'll always come back to this place because it's sooooooooooo good!
