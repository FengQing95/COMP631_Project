Local Foods////Love the concept, not so high on the execution.  The food should be better than it is. It definitely has all the pieces, yet somehow the whole is less than the parts.  Nice decorations, comfortable atmosphere, good looking items. Menu is limited, yet still they can't execute on food quality?! Benjy's is a fave, but this is not up to his high standard.
