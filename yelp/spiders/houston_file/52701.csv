Kata Robata////The food the second time around was phenomenal. The appetizer and entrée portions were in line with what one would expect for dinner. We ordered a few appetizers, all good, but I have to give a shout out to the agedashi tofu, marinated tuna and papaya, Kobe beef skewers and tuna with truffles. The Kobe beef was succulent and full of flavor, exactly what one would expect from Kobe beef. The earthy truffles balanced so nicely (and unexpectedly?) with the tuna, who would have thought? And the marinated tuna had a nice tartness to it, perfect to whet one's appetite and as a prelude to entrée. The sashimi and nigiri we had for entrée was fresh and firm, very nice.
