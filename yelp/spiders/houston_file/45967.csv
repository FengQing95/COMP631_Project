Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Though i had a disappointing visit, I'm still giving this bakery 4 stars because the manager was able to rectify the situation. Long story short, one of their bussers took away my number before my order was fulfilled, so it took longer to figure out what was mine. Outside of that, they never brought my OJ, even though they were ready and waiting at the bar. My kind friend ended up getting up to grab it for me (it was quite the Mentos moment).
