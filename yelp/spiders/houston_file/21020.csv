Uchi////We ate here last Friday for happy hour. We got there right at 5 and there was already a line outside. The line moved fairly quick. The waiters are very friendly and attentive. They bring out the dishes one at a time so you are not overwhelmed with so many plates. Every time a dish is brought out to us, the waiter explains what exactly is in the dish. Bring on the $3 cold sake!
