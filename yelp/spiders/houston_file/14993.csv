JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here with a friend to finally try Jinya. I've had it booked marked over 6months. I was a little disappointed. I excepted so much more. I ordered the chicken ramen. The noodles were very heavy and the chicken tasted fake (if that makes sense) I removed the chicken from my dish. I ate majority of it because it did have a decent flavor and the onions were very tasty. For dessert I tried the mochi green tea ice cream and it was ok as well. My friend wasn't to pleased with their dish either. Probably won't be returning.
