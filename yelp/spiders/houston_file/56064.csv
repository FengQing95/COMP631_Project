Kata Robata////First time experience was pleasant! Thai was our server and he was very attentive and suggestive. We went with some friends who have been there before so we let them order and was not disappointed. But not to say I haven't had some of the items somewhere else that was done better but not knocking off any stars because it's still one of my favorite sushi experience so far. I'll attach photos with descriptions.
