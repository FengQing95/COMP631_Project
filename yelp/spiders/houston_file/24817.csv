Uchi////Impeccable service, delicious food. Only regret was being so so late to catch the uchi hype train. Been travelling to Houston for almost 4 years now and only just made my first visit to Uchi. Won't be the last. I would make select recommendations, but I've only been once so haven't quite established favorites. I will say though, everything recommended by our server was a hit on our table that night. Edamame is charred, salty deliciousness - never had it like that before. All the tempura dishes were hits, we ordered the shag roll? Shaggy roll -- maybe? Twice? Desserts were fantastic too. 10/10.
