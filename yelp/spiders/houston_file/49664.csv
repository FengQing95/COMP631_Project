Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came here after our morning church service. As expected the wait time was roughly 50 minutes, but knowing what to expect we waited to be seated. Our waiter Teri was benevolent enough to answer all our questions and sum! The service itself deserved 5 stars as she went above and beyond to make sure our first time experience was one to remember! Now the food. Jesus Christ almighty, the food was amazing. I got the pancake mix that lets your choose three different favors of pancakes mine being: OMG French toast, blueberry pancakes, and the pineapple upside down pancake. Every single pancake had its own succulent taste that left me beyond words! I could go on about how this place exceeded my exceptions, but know that I will be returning to dine again!
