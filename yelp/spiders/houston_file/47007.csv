Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The three stars is for the food. I had the pineapple upside down pancakes. While they were good they did need a bit of syrup since they seemed a bit dry. The reason for two star deduction is the person who was serving me. I sat at the counter and told the waitress I wanted to look at the menu. She proceeded to walk away and start making other drinks. 10 minutes later she finally came back over to ask what I wanted. I ordered a drink and my food. Instead of giving me a glass of water like she did everyone else she made my drink and went back to ignoring me. There was a guy sitting next to me who she flirted with the whole time and ignored everyone else.
