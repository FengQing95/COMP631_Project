Kata Robata////All in all, I didn't feel like I was getting any kind of experience I hadn't already received somewhere else...like at Soma, another upscale strip-mall sushi joint. Â I'm not quite convinced on Kata Robata being a default destination of choice for upscale sushi, since there are so many choices in Houston that strike the same note.
