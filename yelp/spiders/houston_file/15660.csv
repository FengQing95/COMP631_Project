JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was visiting my parents in Houston and texting back and forth with an old friend from college, trying to find somewhere to meet up for dinner. It turned out that he'd never had legit ramen before, and once I found out that insane fact, I knew that we had to visit JINYA.
