Kata Robata////Had a great leisurely lunch here yesterday with a friend. I've been coming once per week for lunch the last five weeks. Food is always consistently great, whether it's sushi, sashimi, rolls, or cooked (e.g., tempura). Service is attentive but not intrusive. Wait staff were changing gloves often. Top notch place!
