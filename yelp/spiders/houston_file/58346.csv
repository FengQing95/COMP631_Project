Baby Barnaby's////In terms of starting your day off right, this place is tops. You really can't go wrong with delicious food, awesome service, and a huge carafe of coffee on your table. The Corned Beef Hash and Eggs is spectacular and addicting. The Green Eggs always leave me thinking about the next time I can come back. I usually try to go early, but even when there's a wait it's totally worth it. The staff is friendly and always make you feel welcome.
