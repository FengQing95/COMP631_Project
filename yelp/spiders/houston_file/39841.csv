Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Did not like this place at ALL. Instead of bringing me the type of rose' I ordered they up brought me a more expensive one. When I got my check I told them that was not what I ordered and I was told what I was brought was a better quality anyway. There was a $10 difference in the price. Bring me what I order and not what you think I should have ordered. Food was mediocre. I will not be back.
