Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A note on the infamous lines and crowds: Worth it, but don't be expecting an intimate date setting, especially on weekends. Waited only ~15 minutes in line when they opened their doors on a Saturday morning and felt #blessed, but seating was a whole other beast. Our group of 4 had trouble finding a table together, and we were forced to awkwardly sit at the bar-style stools facing the windows and eat for a while before the large common table opened up and we literally sprinted to claim them.
