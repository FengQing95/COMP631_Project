Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Been here for both lunch on Friday and brunch on Sunday now. Great service, great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere. Definitely a new favorite spot in Houston. Breanne took great care of us for brunch service. Can't wait to be back for the Gulf Shrimp & Grits (main dish) and BC Paloma (drink special).
