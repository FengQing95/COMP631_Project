Kata Robata////I was craving good sushi and wasn't in the mood for the long wait line at uchi so I came to eat at kata Robata. I ordered the miso soup, spicy salmon roll, Kobe beef roll, the Texas Kobe beef skewers, Kobe beef tacos, and the yuzu salmon carpaccio. The salmon carpaccio and the beef skewers were my favorite part of the meal. They were amazing and definitely a must try.
