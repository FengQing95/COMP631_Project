Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had a whiskey lunch here. Food is very southern comfort. The homemade chips there are addicting. Â Their whiskey menu is massive, and the staff does a great job with recommendations. Has a small patio, but not really meant for hot summer seating. Maybe more evening. Had a great time and would highly recommend it.
