Local Foods////-Crunchy Chicken Sandwich for $11 had in it - nut "crumble", provolone, buttermilk ranch, and pickles on a pretzel bun. This sandwich was amazing, everything was so tasty from the bun to the chicken to the sauce. I liked how the pretzel bun did not get moist and chicken didn't taste dry. Also if you're one to be picky about the amount of meat served on sandwiches, trust me, they give you more than enough.
