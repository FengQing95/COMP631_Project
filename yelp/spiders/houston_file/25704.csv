Uchi////One of our favorite sushi places in Houston. Get ready to spend some $$$, but it's always been an experience! Great food, drinks, service, and dessert. They do happy hour every weekday 4-6pm that includes food and drinks. I haven't had a single bad dish here, nor a single bad experience. They have a variety of wine, sake, and cocktails to chose from on their happy hour menu as well as their regular menu. They offer a variety of sushi, shashimi, rolls, and other entrees for both happy hour and regular menus. They offer a whole vegetarian menu as well. We absolutely love the taste and texture of the kinoko nabe and the nasu sushi on the vegetarian menu. I love the Hama Chilli on the cool tastings main menu. I always look forward to dining here!
