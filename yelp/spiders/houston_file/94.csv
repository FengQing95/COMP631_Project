Uchi////We finally got a reservation at Uchi! Albeit at 10pm this past Saturday, but it was well worth the wait. We actually weren't seated until closer to 10:30 - place was packed, but there was also some serious disorganization at the hostess desk. We had checked in upon entry, but hostess didn't have noted that we had even arrived 15 minutes after our reservation. I'll blame it on recent opening kinks they will work out, and I didn't let it dampen my excitement for the food.
