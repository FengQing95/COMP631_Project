Uchi////I came here for happy hour.  I was the first to arrive in my party. I was greeted with a piece of sushi when I walked in. I sat at the bar to wait.  The bartenders were attentive and friendly. The hostesses were so understanding and courteous when I told them my party was going to be more than 15 mins late.  When my party arrived we ordered everything and anything.  I was not disappointed. The food was beautiful and delicious. The ham and egg was awesome, the waygu was marinated perfect, and everything else was so good.  We ordered so much and it was all overwhelmingly good.
