Kata Robata////So the rising sun roll.. uh.. I wasn't impressed. The peppercorn tuna really gave a kick, but threw me off, that I couldn't really enjoy it. I thought the peppercorn was too much, but it wasn't terrible! I enjoyed tasting it, but not eating it all.. if that makes sense. The tuna had a nice texture to it, soft, but I just didn't prefer this.
