Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food and drinks are 5 stars. The Snooze Spuds Deluxe is one of my favorites and is really hearty - comfort food at its best. The breakfast burrito isn't particularly creative or unusual but it's a good, safe choice. The Bella! Bella! Benny is my favorite Benedict. The Chile Verde and Steak and Eggs Benny are good but are a bit too rich for me. If you're planning to have a pancake on the side, you may want to go with a lighter Benny. The B.E.A.T. sandwich is okay (I've had better versions of this). You MUST get the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes. They are my favorite thing on the menu and sometimes I dream about them when I haven't had them in a while. The OMG French Toast is also a good choice.
