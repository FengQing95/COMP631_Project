Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lovely place for a Sunday brunch!! (Minus the long wait) You do have to wait pretty long to order and sit, but the food, atmosphere, and service are all worth the wait. I love their croissants, and didn't know their macarons are awesome as well until I tried them today! The lavender macaron was the best I've ever had in my life! The fragrance remained in my mouth for about 5 min. It was soooo good!
