The Pit Room////First off let me start by saying if you decide to eat here be ready to wait around 45 minutes. BUT TRUST ME THE FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT. I have the 3 meat plate and I would recommend the venison sausage, brisket (no brainer), and the pulled pork. For your sides do not get the cole slaw it had no taste. I recommend if you like hot sauce to get the habanero bbq sauce it is the perfect blend between sweet bbq and spicy habanero.
