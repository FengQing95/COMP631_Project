Uchi////I have to eat here every time I visit Houston. I live in Southern California where we have some great sushi restaurants, but Uchi remains my favorite. The service is always as impeccable as the food. Uchi is the only restaurant I long for when I leave Houston. It's just a great culinary experience.
