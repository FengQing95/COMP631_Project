Uchi////As with any fusion, small plates restaurant, the prices are high, and the inventiveness doesn't pay off every single time for every palette.  No one flat out hated any dish, but there were few that we all agreed were awesome.  The standouts were the wagyu hot rock, kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) tempura, and brussel sprouts.
