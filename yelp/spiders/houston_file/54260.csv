Kata Robata////Salmon Soft Shell Crab Roll: Wow. Solidly average. Really nothing to be excited about. This was a very bare bones sushi roll. Which, I am fine with however I would not be happy paying more than the $9 happy hour price for this. They did really nothing to compliment the flavor of the salmon or soft crab.
