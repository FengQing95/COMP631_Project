Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////BLOOPER: The funny thing is that we didn't realise that Bosscat was in the Highland Village area; my friend and I looked like bums that night, but the place looked like it had dress code and if you weren't dressed for the occasion, no service. When the hostess started leading us to our table, we just kept walking and walking, but when we got to an actual table, we both had a sigh of relief because we literally thought that she was escorting us out to some back exit. Hah!
