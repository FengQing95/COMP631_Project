The Pit Room////I've visited this place on a few occasions and I've enjoyed it every time. The brisket is smokey and full of flavor. Chicken seems to be a difficult task at most bbq places but this chicken is moist and well seasoned. There are a few sides to choose from and I get the macaroni every visit. The building isn't very big so there is outside seating available.
