Kata Robata////Decent Japanese restaurant. We came specifically for the American Kobe, which was nicely grilled and very tender. It's pretty pricy though $17 for just two skewers. We also ordered the tonkatsu ramen which had a good broth but could be a bit more flavorful or salty. I loved the salted eggs in them and the dish is overall pretty simple with a few slices of pork and some noodles.
