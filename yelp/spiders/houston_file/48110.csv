Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service: Came here Thursday midday- 30 minutes to be seated and then another 45minutes for food to arrive. Crazy slow service- maybe growing pains of just being open? Thought the 45 minute wait for eggs was ridiculous. With the exception of our waiter, the staff was not friendly. Seemed annoyed and irritated at everyone in the restaurant. Extremely unorganized.
