The Pit Room////This place was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the top BBQ places I have been to in Houston. I ordered the two meat plate, which comes with two sides. I elected to have the pork ribs, brisket, mac&cheese, and charro beans. I also added queso/chips. This is a fast casual joint. You order at the counter and shuffle down the line to pick out your sides and other accompaniments. After you pay, you can then travel to their condiments bar to load up on different sauces, peppers, etc.
