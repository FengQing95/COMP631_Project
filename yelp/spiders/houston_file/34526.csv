Local Foods////I love coming here for lunch. The inside is just so modern and trendy and the food here delicious. I always get the smoked salmon on a bagel and switch up the sides. This time around I got the watermelon and the soba noodles. I normally don't get anything Asian at a non-Asian place but decided to try it out. I personally didn't like it because of the extra stuff added. Soba can honestly do just fine on its own or with a tad bit of sauce. The salmon was delicious. I brought a friend and she got the chicken sandwich with pretzel bread and liked it too.
