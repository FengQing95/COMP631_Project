Baby Barnaby's////So many yelpers can't be wrong. My husband and I ventured to this little establishment on a fateful Saturday morning after reading all the rave reviews. We built up our expectations and were still blown out of the water - we were met with the most scrumptious food! Everything was so fresh and tasty....we can't wait to visit again.
