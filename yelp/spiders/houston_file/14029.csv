JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Ana - Thank you for your review. Are you able to help me further understand how the taste of our ramen was "off" to you? First, we package our to-go ramen at more than 200F; however, the soup containers are cardboard and will lose heat. We include "How to Eat Ramen" cards with each order that recommend re-heating the broth in a microwave oven before dining. Moreover, may I ask which ramen you ordered? I would like to determine how any of our ramen dishes would have a "very strong chicken flavor," assuming you did not, in fact, order a ramen that contained chicken broth. I look forward to hearing from you.
