The Pit Room////I splurged for the beef rib, it was too sexy to turn down on a first encounter, though it was delicious, once I tried the brisket, there is no turning back. It doesn't even need sauce! Though the sauce is incredible as well, it's not as thick, rich, or sweet as other sauces. They have a great pickle bar, even pickled green onions, which I thought was a nice touch. The jalape√±o sausage was pretty great, nothing too much stood out about it though. The Mac and cheese was delicious but I was surprised to find myself craving more of the coleslaw. I never thought I'd be a Coleslaw type girl but man was this stuff good, it almost had a vinegar type taste to it. Delicious. The elote was fresh, and crunchy (you can always tell when it's out of a can)
