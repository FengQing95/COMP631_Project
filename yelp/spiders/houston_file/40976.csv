Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Mmmm comfort food at its best. The food here is so good and the service was awesome as well. Came here for lunch with a friend. We were planning on coming in on a Sunday around 2:30PM but were alerted they close from 2:30-3:00 to clean the kitchen and change the menus from brunch to lunch/dinner. This was fine but random haha. Show up at 3 and are seated immediately. This was awesome because the place was packed- but they have an ample amount of indoor or outdoor seating. We started off with the spicy chicken and cheese dip which was amazing. So freaking good. The chicken in the dip had Nashville hot chicken spices, and was served warm with homemade potato chips. YUUUUMYY! For my entree I ordered the chicken sausage pasta. This was so good but so very heavy. I would recommend sharing! It was a tomato pesto sauce Â with chicken sausage, veggies and pappardelle pasta. Soooo good but could not finish my plate. Made for awesome take out though!
