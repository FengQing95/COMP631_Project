Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Beautiful cafe that's constantly packed (even early on a Saturday). I just got a bialy with cream cheese so can't much judge the pastries. They look gorgeous. My herbal guava tea was delicious. And my friend enjoyed her enormous chicken torta. The pork dish seemed to be a crowd favorite. I'll be back for coffee and croissant!
