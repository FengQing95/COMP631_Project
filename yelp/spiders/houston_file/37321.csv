Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had high expectations coming to this place. We came after a long day of needing Happy Hour. First the bartender accuses me of not ordering a drink, after I patiently waited 10+ mins for my beer. I then had to remind him that he saw my ID and he apologized. My cousin found hair all over her silverware. And my wings were okay. My cousin did love her martinis and had maybe 3. My love street had so much carbonation I could barely drink...but I'm not big beer drinker so I'm not sure what that was about. Overall I may be back for drinks because of the location..however the food isn't as memorable. If maybe the bartender wasn't so confrontational about my drink order, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. It's easier to say, "I'm sorry, I forgot, what can I get you again, than no you didn't order a drink, but what do you want."
