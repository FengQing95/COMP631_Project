Uchi////We ordered 10-course chef's special for 2 people ($195+tax+tip). Food was tasty, but the portion is very little. Each dish was around 4 bites, shared by two people. I am happy that we had a little bit of a variety of food, including salmon, yellowtail, quail, oyster, crab, seeweed, broccoli, etc. The flavors were amazing, rich in citrus and excellent blend of herbs and fruits. The dessert was unique as well - peanut ice cream. Because the portion is small, we finished every course within 1 minute and kept drinking a lot of water while waiting for next dish.
