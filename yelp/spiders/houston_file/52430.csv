Kata Robata////Being kind of a self proclaimed sushi snob I do take pride in being able to Â tell my Toro from my Maguro. Came out to Kata Robata with old friends and new since I have moved to Houston and it was definitely worth writing home about. Between the 7 of us we probably tried almost every thing on the menu.. from their Sashimi platters and tastings to the Kobe Beef carpaccio and even the amazing lobster tail mac n cheese.
