JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Dana, Thank you for your kind review. I'm glad you enjoyed your meal. I also appreciate your comment regarding our servers' attire, though it's worth noting that as a franchise concept, we are contractually bound to adhere to every detail (including the rock garden) as mandated by company headquarters in Los Angeles. Thanks again,
