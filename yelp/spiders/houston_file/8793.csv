JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Environment: usually you have to wait in line for at least 15 minutes to get seated. I usually come on Sunday afternoons to avoid a large crowd. But still, I personally think it's worth the wait. The staff here aren't the friendliest but they're definitely polite and attentive. So overall JINYA at midtown is a great choice.
