Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze needs to hire really badass hosts or hostesses. My sister had called in our order to-go before we headed out of the house. Was told that the food would be ready in 30 minutes so we even stopped at the H-E-B nearby to kill some time. When we got there, the hostess peeked into a couple of bags and said our order isn't quite ready yet. No problem. Another 20 go by, asked if she could check how long it would take (pretended to walk away but we could see that she checked with no one). We were there a total of 70 minutes waiting for our to-go food. When my sister asked to see a manager, he found that our food was in one of the 2 bags the hostess looked at upon walking in. So it was ready the entire time. She sucks, I'm sorry but you're a terrible worker. Luckily the manager fixed everything, but we could have ended up eating there in less time. Due to her incompetence, I missed being able to check in with a family member who just came out of surgery. By the way - I believe she saw everything that happened and didn't care to say anything. Other servers were way more helpful!
