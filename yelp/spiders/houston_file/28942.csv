The Pit Room////This has to be one of my favorite local BBQ restaurants. This is  a cafeteria style dinning and it's eating area is very small.  Its a bit pricey but well worth it. The brisket, pork rib and the different selection of sausages are mouth watering.  If you really want to treat yourself try their beef rib.
