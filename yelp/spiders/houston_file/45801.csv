Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Firstly, its such an amazing space and the smell of fresh baked bread while we walked in was wonderful. I had the gingerbread latte and it was extremely tasty and my brother loved his latte as well. The icing on the cake (literally) was the hazelnut chocolate cupcake. The cupcake has nutella inside it!!!!! But the frosting was the winner for me. It was light, not too sweet and perfectly topped the cupcake :)
