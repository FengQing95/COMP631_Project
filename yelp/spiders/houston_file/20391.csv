Uchi////Also, don't let the 4-dollar-sign rating deter you from getting a chance to try this place out. Their HH is totally worth it, and it's a good place to start if you want to try a bunch of things out, like tapas style. Just keep it mind that it gets packed during that time, so make a reservation or expect to wait. ;)
