Kata Robata////As amazing as dinner was, the cherry on top was definitely our server and personal friend, Jenny. She is THE absolute sweetest girl on the planet! Even if I didn't know her, there's no way I could not appreciate her knowledge of the menu, honest [and rewarding] recommendations, careful attentiveness, and her glowing, gracious smile.
