Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the benny duo- half Harvest and half Benny Goodman. The harvest had a lot more flavor. We shared a pancake flight with one blueberry danish, one pineapple upside down, and one sweet potato. The sweet potato didn't really do it for me, but the pineapple upside down was to die for. I really liked the streusel on the blueberry danish, but overall, it was a little too saucy for me. My friend ordered the pot pie, which I had a bite of, and we both agreed that it was delicious.
