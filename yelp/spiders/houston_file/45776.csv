Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is one of my favorite places to come to when I need my pastry fix! The lines are alwayssss long but it's super worth it, and also gives you time to choose what you want because let's be real...everything looks so good! To be honest, the rest of the menu doesn't appeal to me so I don't ever order brunch/lunch from here.
