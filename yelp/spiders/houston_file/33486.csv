Local Foods////I'm in Houston for the week for work and read all the reviews on this place and thought I'd give it a try. The ambiance is really inviting and not at all too pretentious for a local food place. Service was great, and prices were fair for what you get and the food quality. If definitely recommend the crunchy chicken sandwich and the slaw. The kale salad was a little hard to eat in the cup it comes with. The only bad feedback I have is that the chicken was a bit on the dry side and could have used a touch more of the delicious sauce. The pretzel bun is incredible, not matter what sand which you get, definitely get the pretzel bun!
