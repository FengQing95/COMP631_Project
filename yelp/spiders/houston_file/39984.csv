Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The steak and potatoes was not even steak, just a thin slice of gristle and fat doused with sauce. Truly inedible. You can see it in the photo. The burger and fries were ok but were super greasy and the cornbread buns were dry and actually dusty (from the cornbread flour on top).
