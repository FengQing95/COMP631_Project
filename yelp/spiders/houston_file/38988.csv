Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the Kentucky hot brown, which is an open faced turkey sandwich and added avocado. Lemme say the menu's description didn't do it justice. It was so flavorful I don't think I stopped eating until it was gone. Everyone seemed to love their food. I know the girls next to me were raving about the Bosscat burger fixed the chefs way, which is the way to. Go all in or nothing right?!
