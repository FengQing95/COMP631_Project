Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////SUPER crowded on weekends, so the line to order can get a bit long and it can be difficult to find a table (even for 2). Though many people have raved about this place, when I finally went for brunch mid-morning on a Saturday, they were already out of a lot of the pastries on the menu. Thus, when I finally got through the line, several of the items I'd decided to order were no longer available.
