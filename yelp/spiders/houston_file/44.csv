Local Foods////I tried this place as a recommendation from a co-worker. At first, I was a bit hesitant about paying $9-$12 for a sandwich but I purchased one and quickly realized 2 things. 1. Totally worth the money knowing it's not frozen food that just gets heated up and served. 2. You'll spend the same money going to a place like cheddar's or chili's for lunch after tipping a server. I've probably tried 4 of their sandwiches and they are all excellent. The lemongrass chicken soup is incredible. To drink, the mint-ade is awesome. For the arnold palmer fan, mix it with tea. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to everyone asking for a good place to eat.
