Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////When it comes to the food I was a bit unimpressed because of the pricing. The Mac and cheese was ok and the fries had a great crisp to them but something just seemed off about the tastes. My wife's shaved pork chop sandwich was ok but Â it was a bit dry. it could use a nice sauce to complement the pork and pickles. The burger was not for me, I'm more of a burger purist so I was not into the multiple ingredient but the garlic aioli was a must. I tasted the actual meat by itself and it was good. It had a nice crust on the outside and it was cooked a good medium rare going on medium.
