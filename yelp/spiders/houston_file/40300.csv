Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Yes.....I clocked in my REGULAR Â badge here. I'll don that proudly and would like to share it with my peeps. Whiskey for daysssssss, a not so extensive food menu (which is good for you indecisives) but everything onnnit is mouthwatering and just amazing. Like who thought ever to make Portabello mushroom fries?! Don't even start to hate on that cuz they "sound" weird. But let me tell you: you're missin out *mic drop*
