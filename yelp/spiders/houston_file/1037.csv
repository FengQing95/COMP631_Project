JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Marquise - Thanks for your review. As a JINYA franchisee, we are given strict orders by corporate headquarters to not allow substitutions besides broth for broth or chashu for chashu. I'm sorry if this doesn't jibe with what you are accustomed to at JINYA-Los Angeles, but we must follow the orders we are given. As far as serving size is concerned, we are using the same soup ladles and noodle types that are mandated by corporate, so I'm not sure why there would be any discrepancy there, either.
