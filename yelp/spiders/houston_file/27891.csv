The Pit Room////My sister-in-law was in town and wanted to have BBQ since she didn't have many where she is from. We were in the Heights so we decided to go here based on Yelp reviews and distance. We ordered the brisket, elite (corn), Mac n Cheese, and the sausages. The meats were solid...wish the brisket was cut thinner. My favorite was the elote. Overall, this place is pretty good, not the best I had. Maybe it was an off night? I am willing to return and try it again if in the area.
