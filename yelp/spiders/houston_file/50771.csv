Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here again recently and had another scrumptious experience. The wait, however, was not so. I was quoted a 45 minute wait and ended up waiting a little over an hour. They don't have full control over how fast people eat but I'd always prefer to over-estimate than under.
