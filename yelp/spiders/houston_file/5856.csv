JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came on a weeknight around 6:45, and there was no wait at all.  The restaurant is set up with small booths for 2 on the left, 2 large communal tables in the middle, and a few regular tables on the right.  You may be sitting next to strangers at the communal table if you come on a busy night.
