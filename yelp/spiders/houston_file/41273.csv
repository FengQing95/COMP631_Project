Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My wife had the Spicy Boudin Benedict and I had the Chicken Torta. The first is the best egg benedict I've ever had, with a Boudin sausage that tasted delicious with perfect texture. The chicken torta is basically a pulled chicken sandwich in a ciabatta bun with their twist of a guacamole sauce - awesome! I also had a latte and they use Ritual coffee from San Francisco, perfectly cut. The coffee is a bit pricey, the orange juice is small, but still definitely worth the visit for brunch. Get there early, lines are long.
