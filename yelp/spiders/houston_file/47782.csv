Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So this place is okay. Between the wait time to be seated and to receive your food was 2 hours! That's a long time for okay food. The service was great--our waitress gave a list of her favorites and the most popular items which allowed us to make a quick decision in what we wanted to order.
