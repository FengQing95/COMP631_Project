Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really want to love this place, but it doesn't seem like its in the cards. The environment is beautiful, with large windows providing plenty of natural light. The food however... not so great. I've had the chocolate chip cookie, which can be described at best as fair, and several coffee drinks (iced coffee, latte, etc.) I have never really enjoyed the drinks. Strange, since I think they use Boomtown coffee, and I love the coffee at Boomtown. Something in the preparation is not being translated into the taste of the drinks.
