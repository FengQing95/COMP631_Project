JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your generous comments.  I do apologize about the parking situation.  The only days that we don't have valet at the garage is on Sundays.  However, I am working diligently with the landlord and valet service to come out and provide valet service on Sundays in the near future.  I appreciate your continued patronage and look forward to seeing you again at Jinya Ramen Bar.
