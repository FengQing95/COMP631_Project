Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We waited approximately five minutes before being seated. Kudos to the hostess as he sent over a chocolate covered pancake with a lit candle in celebration of my husband's birthday. We hadn't received a menu or water. This was really thoughtful of him and we really appreciated the gesture. He loved the pancake and tried really hard not to eat it all. LOL
