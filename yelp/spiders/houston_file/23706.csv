Uchi////Great Japanese inspired restaurant in Houston. Upscale atmosphere. Rsvp recommended. Otherwise, get in line at 4:45 before 5pm opening and you should be able to be seated for happy hour. Waiters are attentive, helpful with recommendations, and present food with explanations. They come around often to check in with drinks and plate changes.
