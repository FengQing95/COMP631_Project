Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time here.. during the time of Covid..Jackie and Dom were our first impression of Bosscat. EXTREMELY impressed, comfortable, and feeling the cool evening breeze of Houston...rare!! Â We expressed our desire for a cocktail and Jackie interpreted it flawlessly. We were served Vieux Carrie (off the menu), a boozy bourbon forward cocktail that fit the bill. In addition, the music was on point and I felt at home. This place is a 10/10
