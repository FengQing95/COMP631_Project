Local Foods////The restaurant doesn't have that much seating so people are forced to share tables.  I was expecting hot actually crispy chick on my sandwich and it was cold like they put on salads.  Also all the sides were cold too.  I pretty much like all food I eat hot except salads... And I rarely order that out at restaurants.  The cashier lady was rude as well don't think I will be back.
