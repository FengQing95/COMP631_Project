Uchi////+ Chef's Choice Sushi (5 pieces) - I can't remember ever piece of fish on that wood block that night (tuna, salmon, flounder, sea bass, and one I'm missing!), but I have to speak to how fresh each cut was. Also, for the flounder and sea bass, how thoughtfully they were prepared with a little bit of extras on top, some citrus flavor, a bit of a herb or spice. Every bit was fantastic.
