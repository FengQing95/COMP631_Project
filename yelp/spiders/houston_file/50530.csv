Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had a great Sunday morning breakfast! Wait was long, but we were able to snag a spot at the bar and we were so glad we did. Bartenders, Jordan & Gabe, were extremely attentive and nice. We could tell they were busy, but still felt like they paid a ton of attention to us and ensured that our meal was awesome. Thanks, guys!
