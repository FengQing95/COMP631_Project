Kata Robata////The best sashimi in Houston, caters to even the most picky of palates.  We took my sister and her husband here while they were visiting from out of town and they (Yelp Eliters) said it was the best fish they had ever had. For you carnivores, the pork belly was amazing and tender. The sake list is also very reasonable, especially for Houston where I find most of the lists to be "lacking refinement."  Pricey but totally worth it. Get the chutoro (super fatty tuna) for a life changing experience in sashimi.
