The Pit Room////If you've had mid Texas BBQ, then you'll know this place is relatively close in comparison to the BBQ capital of Texas, Austin. I would say the sides here are much more flavorful than most BBQ spots. The BBQ sauce itself was very unique in flavor. Had more of a thick texture like marinara sauce. Imagine a smoked sweet tomato sauce that has the tangy consistency like your traditional bbq sauce.
