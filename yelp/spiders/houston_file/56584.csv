Kata Robata////To end on a high note, the foods I would recommend are the spicy salmon roll (can't go wrong with a classic) and the fresh catch ceviche. Have you seen the way it's presented? Don't worry, I'll include a picture. It's so cute and of course yummy! Lastly I must include that the service was good, prompt and friendly.
