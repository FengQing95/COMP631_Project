Local Foods////I got the "crunchy" chicken sandwich with kale and chips as my two sides. The pretzel bun definitely adds a different flavor to the sandwich. The little bit of saltiness made the sandwich complete. The pickles in the sandwich are so delicious as well. The kale was so good as well. We decided to eat outdoors because the weather was pretty nice. Parking is a hassle but there is a parking structure across the street.
