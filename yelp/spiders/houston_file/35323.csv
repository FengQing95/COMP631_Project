Local Foods////My review here is for delivery service. Its pretty consistent and fast. Ordering online via apps pretty straight forward. Sandwich comes with two sides. I also tried their carrot cupcake and that was pretty good too. On the healthier side, but still a good flavor (perhaps like a muffin).
