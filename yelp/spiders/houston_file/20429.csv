Uchi////First time visiting Uchi: food was amazing but management was a disaster! Daniel the manager cut my group of 4 off 8 sakes and over $400 worth of food because he felt we ordered too much alcohol. We then took our business to sushi tora where they gladly served they're paying, loyal customers.
