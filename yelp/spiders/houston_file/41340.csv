Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food was fantastic! The veal was falling-apart delicious, and the sweetbreads, tomatoes, and even the fish soup (?) went together much more nicely than expected... loved the mushrooms especially. I am a huge fan of flaky pastries, so the airy, layered croissant was pretty on point for me. The outside was browned and crispy, and there was a thin layer of almond jam on the bottom of the pastry to add some additional sweetness.
