Local Foods////1. Garden Sammie (with Pretzel Bun): The Garden Sammie is an incredibly flavorful vegan option that even meat-eaters will love. It has curried cauliflower, crispy, brussels sprouts, and marinated onions that give it a lovely tang. While the ciabatta is tasty, the pretzel bun is truly the star of the show when it comes to bread options at Local Foods. I get this sandwich consistently, and have never been disappointed.
