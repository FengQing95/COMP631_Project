Baby Barnaby's////We placed our order and I asked if they had anything for kids to color with and she said yes I will bring it to you. Again we waited and waited - nothing. So my son started taking the sugar packets out of dish and laying them on the table in a pattern. That got the waitresses attention. She came over and took the sugar packets away from my son and told him to stop that and handed him something to color. Now I was still OK at this point but when we put a placemat on the table for our 19 month old the waitress came over and told us we could not do that and we needed to take it off the table because it may make the table sticky that is when I was completely done with the place. She offered to give us a coloring paper to place the food on instead. I declined and told her he would just throw it in the floor.
