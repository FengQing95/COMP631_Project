The Pit Room////I usually get the two meat plate, with fatty brisket and jalapeno sausage. Not really big on sausage at most bbq spots, but I do get it here. It has the right amount of spice and cheddar in it! Sides are all great too, I usually get the potato salad and elotes, but you do you and you won't be upset with any of the selections.
