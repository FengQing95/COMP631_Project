The Pit Room////Good bbq but not exceptional. We wanted to order short ribs but they ran out that day so it was a pity. By the time we sit down the food is semi cold which definitely affected the taste. It's not at the level of Lockhart but it s right in the center of Houston which is definitely a plus.
