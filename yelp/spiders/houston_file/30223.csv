The Pit Room////Waited in line for one hour to try this place. Husband and I ordered the three meat plate (same meats) and gets more ribs than me. They didn't weigh it out. He got two pieces of bread and I got one. What does this mean? Inconsistency. No one likes inconsistencies. If you pay for something you expect to get the same thing each time. Otherwise you feel screwed. Moving on to the food. Brisket, turkey, ribs, and venison sausage were average at best. Sides we tried were the green beans, potato salad, cole slaw, elote, and mac and cheese. Al average. Definitely not the best bbq spot in Houston. Where is there better bbq you ask? First place winner is Brookstreet BBQ, second is Rudy's, and third is Ray's BBQ. We would never return here. Overpriced and overhyped place.
