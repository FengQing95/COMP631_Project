Kata Robata////Now my favorite.  The Mac and cheese.  Wow.  I've had some great tasting Mac and Cheese and I can honestly say this one I can mark as a favorite.  My friends even enjoyed it!!! Chunks of lobster in each bite...creamy and the blend of cheeses and flavor really came together.  An exquisite dish!
