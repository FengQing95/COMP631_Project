The Pit Room////Ordered a three meat dinner plate as I wanted a variety. Asked which sausage he recommended, and luckily he recommend the cheddar jalapeno one which I wanted! I also got one pork rib and the brisket with the bbq sauce on the side. For my sides, I got the mac and cheese and elote. Elote was a surprising side option and I was glad to see it! Liked how they had a homemade pickled bar of onions, pickles, jalapenos, and even green onion!
