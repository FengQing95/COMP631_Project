Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////this place is super delicious but expect to have circle the tiny parking lot to find no parking and then circle around the block to find street parking, and then wait in a pretty good sized line when you finally get in. even though I really don't like crowded places, its hard for me to stay away. the entire bakery is pretty cramped. its not a very big place so I suppose they are trying to maximize seating.
