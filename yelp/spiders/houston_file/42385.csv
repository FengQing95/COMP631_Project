Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went with a few friends for Sunday brunch, and the line was pretty freakin' long. As one reviewer said, the demographic is 25-35 year old young professionals, mostly couples when I went. It wasn't cheap for sure. I got a loco moco for $14 and each macaron is $2.25. Most of the pastries are $4-$5. The almond croissant was flaky and sweet with just the right amount of air pockets but the loco moco was just okay. My friend got an eggplant parmesan sandwich which was super scrumptious. The decor is cute and the uniforms are super cute, too, but too much for me. In fact everything was too much. It was too expensive, too cute, too crowded, and too hyped. But I can't say it wasn't delicious.
