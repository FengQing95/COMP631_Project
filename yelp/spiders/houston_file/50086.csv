Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OK, first let me start off by saying that my boyfriend is never punctual for anything, but for Snooze he is. He hates waiting in line, but for Snooze he will. This is our second time here and yes the wait can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours! Â My favorite things to order is the Benny Duo: Benny Goodman and Bella Bella Benny! OMG its divine. Salmon and prosciutto (eggs benedict) how can you not? The presentation alone makes you want to wipe away your saliva because you're too busy drooling. Once I ate the eggs benedict, I can't go anywhere else.
