Uchi////My husband and I have visited many countries and have tasted a variety of different types of food, but I have to say Uchi impressed us both.  It was our first time visiting and we tried the omakase (chef's choice 10 course meal).  I was A-Maz-Ing.  The flavors of each dish were so unique and the mixture of food just really enhanced our taste buds.  I loved the pairing of fruit with sashimi!  Every dish that came out was  a delightful surprise and the wait staff was terrific and friendly.  Tyson Cole even personally brought out a hamachi rice dish and "cooked" it at our table.  He introduced himself and visited with us.  I would suggest the omakase if you're a first timer. You get to taste a variety of foods that you would normally not order from the menu.
