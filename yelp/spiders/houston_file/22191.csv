Uchi////I cannot think of one thing to complain about when it comes to Uchi. My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day dinner and enjoyed the entire experience. The thing that stood out to us, other than the food, was the impeccable service! I have never had better service than I did at Uchi. They, of course, ask if it is your first time and make sure to explain each detail regarding how to order. The waiters were very knowledgeable and describe how to eat the food to get the full effect of the flavors. They are also so quick with making sure you drinks are always full and table clean of any trash. At one point my boyfriend and I would put small items on the table to see if we noticed the waiters quickly sweep it off our table... we only caught them once! I know thats kind of lame but we were just that amazed. Haha
