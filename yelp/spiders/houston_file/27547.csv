The Pit Room////I am so glad this place is here, easily the best bbq in houston (Killens is damn good but not in Houston).  I have been here multiple times and this place is consistently good.  When you are outside of the restaurant you can smell the bbq smoke in the air, a good sign.  There are a couple entrances depending on where you park.  Parking can be somewhat limited but there is street parking in the neighborhood surrounding.
