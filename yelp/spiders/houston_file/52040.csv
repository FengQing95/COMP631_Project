Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Joined the online waitlist for 30min, finally got called but could not find parking or get into the restaurant. They are letting people hang out in front of the restaurant and block the entrance making it impossible to to park in their lot and all parking on the street was full too. This is not surprising since they apparently do not turn anyone away but instead allow people to keep joining the waitlist to overrun the parking and waiting areas. This location is just not managed well, the other locations do not have this problem. We have been to this location several times and it is always like this, but usually we have all morning to sit around waiting for a parking spot and table - just got tired of waiting around today.
