Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I just sat down. Quoted wait time is understandable. But host staff is unacceptable. They don't smile they don't acknowledge or say hi. And the black young female just walks around moping around doing nothing and talking to staff and personally sat one of her friends. That is the only time she smiled. That doesn't bode well for return visits from anyone. Food is good but service will kill.
