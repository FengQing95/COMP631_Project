Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First off, the decor and the place itself is airy and modern. There are floor to ceiling windows to allow plenty of natural lighting in to showcase the exquisitely created pastries. These pastries were encased and displayed through clear, crisp glass. Each were lined along the order line where you chose what you wanted in exchange for an order number. The ordering system was efficient with warm staff to help along the way. This is definitely a trendy place to be at.
