Local Foods////I was traveling to Houston from Austin for a football game and recently saw this place listed on Yahoo home page as one of the best sandwiches. My other research told me this was a tasty and popular place to go when visiting Houston. Sadly this is the most disappointed i've ever been in a lunch spot. I'm a picky bastard but It takes a lot to make me hate a meal. My wife and I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwhich and its was very lackluster. The pretzel bun didn't have much flavor and the shredded chicken was so dry and lacked any sort of seasoning or flavor. Even SALT would have been great. it had no salt whatsoever. I've had rotisserie chicken meat from crappy supermarkets that tasted better than this dried out non seasoned chicken. The toppings on the sandwhiche did not make this any better. To add insult to injury the "buttermilk ranch" was green from being pureed with way way way too much dill and it tasted lousy. The dill overpowered the ranch and was a terrible excuse for ranch. Not surprising Â they found a way to screw up buttermilk ranch dressing. Even the house made kettle chips had zero flavor or salt. The kettle chips at a gas station like Buc'ees trumped that by FAR. overall the place looks nice and inviting and has a great sounding menu but they ultimately fail to deliver in execution and seasoning.
