Local Foods////When the food came out, I was already impressed because the food wasn't a tiny portion where I would have to seek food at another place. My duck confit was amazing! It was juicy and so flavourful but tasted healthy at the same time. My two sides that came with the dish were healthy and a had unique taste to it. For the crunchy chicken, I love the pretzel-looking bread that came with it. You can't go wrong with these two dishes because they're bursting with flavours.
