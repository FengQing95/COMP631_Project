Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I dropped by here one day right before close with my husband just to grab one of their pastries to take home. The staff was very friendly and the pastry was even more note worthy! We got the chocolate croissant, the Nutella croissant, and a chocolate chip cookie(don't judge)... and they were all definitely deserving of a 5 star rating. We will be back to indulge ASAP for sure!!
