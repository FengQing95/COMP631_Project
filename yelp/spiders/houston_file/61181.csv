Baby Barnaby's////Great brunch location in Midtown. I loved their Green Eggs dish (I switched out the sausage for bacon). My boyfriend got their red velvet pancakes. The pancakes are HUGE but it was more of a dessert than a breakfast item. Wait was pretty fast on a Sunday at 10:30 (about 30 min) and we got seated outside. There were a ton of fans and it was shaded so it wasn't too hot. Highly recommend!
