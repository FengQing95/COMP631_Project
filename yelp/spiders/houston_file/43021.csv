Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant): would probably have been delicious if warm. by the time I ate it the chocolate inside had hardened and just tasted like a piece of Hershey's. There was also barely any chocolate, and basically half of the croissant crumbled into nothingness.
