Uchi////Only downside of this place, is that it is super busy, good luck trying to get a reservation the day of. Also, even if you are one of the lucky few to grab a seat at the bar or sushi bar, you will have a ton of people crowded around you while waiting for their tables, or stalking you for your seats (awkward).
