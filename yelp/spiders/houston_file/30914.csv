The Pit Room////This is the best BBQ I have ever eaten!!! I haven't actually tried too many Bbq restaurants since I live in LA but wow the meat is tender and juicy. I love the Mac and cheese side dish and the string beans! I really wanted to try the wagyu beef ribs but of course after waiting in line for an hour the people in front of me ordered the last one :(. I ordered the elote corn and really enjoyed it the first time, however the second time I thought it was a bit sour. Next time I'm in Houston I will definitely stop by again.
