Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is cute and modern but honestly quite expensive for what it really is. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and for $12 I just got a sesame bun with a tiny pork sausage, an egg and arugula. It was not bad and the bun was actually yummy. The single chocolate chip walnut cookie was 3.50. Also had a flat white and tasted a little burnt. Service was not bad but not much either so I ended up regretting the 15% I had to click after I paid. The music was too loud as well. Don't think we'll be back anytime soon.
