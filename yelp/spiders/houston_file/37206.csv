Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I don't drink much alcohol due to my allergies, but from what my friends told me, the drinks are amazing. I did have the blackberry lemonade and that was delicious. Our server was extremely helpful in making recommendations and telling me what was included or not included in some of the dining choices I had questions on. I ended up getting the Bosscat Burger. The burgers and sandwiches do not come with sides, so those are ordered extra. I ordered the Bosscat Fries on the side. The fries are wedges and comes with a special ketchup. The Bosscat Burger tasted amazing. I was told this burger can't be customized, so if you have food allergies make sure you ask what is on the burger because the menu doesn't describe everything that is on it. The bun is so soft and the burger is perfectly juicy. I would definitely order this burger again.
