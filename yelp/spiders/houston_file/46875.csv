Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is beyond delicious, reasonable and they're so accommodating with changes and substitutions. I'm not really a pancake person but I had the pancake flight with the omg French toast, sweet potato pancake, and pineapple upside down pancake. Amazing! The Mm mm mimosa is great as well. Definitely one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots. My only complaints would be the minimal parking and the wait but I still gave them 5 stars because they make up for it in taste and service. Can't hold it against them that so many others love it too.
