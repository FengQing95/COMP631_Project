Kata Robata////I have frequented this place many times before. I am a proud native Houstonian foodie and was out with 3 executives. We sat at the small bar table and had one...1: only one, yes, 1 bottle of wine. My friend accidentally knocked over her wine glass bc we were cramped. And admittedly, I'm really klutzy. BUT 30 min later after $200 worth of food, when we tried to order another glass of wine, they refused us! We are in our 40s, 4 of us! Truly having a good time talking. The bartender was overwhelmed but was the one that "cut us off" accusing us of breaking glasses?!! No. Never happened. So insulting. The manager was pathetic offering nothing of substance. Were we disruptive? No. Did we make any demands; were we  difficult? No. We were having fun. So appalled; will never will return.  That the manager never even came over to assess or talk to us and let some sad bartender ruin his business is a shame. Pathetic.  Regardless of how good the food is, there are way too many establishments with good food and the unprofessional treatment we received was hideous. One bottle of wine! We are done.
