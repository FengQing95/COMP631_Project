Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Was in the area and remembered a friend had recommended the place to me, decided to give it a try. The wait was minimal, made easier by the drinks that we got, and we were quickly seated by the friendly staff. Wait for food time was a bit longer than the actual wait, but no matter, the food was amazing. Girlfriend got the classic breakfast and everything was made to order, the bacon slightly too burnt but wasn't that much of an issue. I had the Havana Daydreaming which both of us were delighted by. We now have plans to come by at least once a month!
