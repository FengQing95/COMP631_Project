JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Krystal - Thank you so much for the kind words and 5-star review. When we receive positive feedback like this, it really does wonders for our (my) psyche, and it can help serve as a balm for some of the -- how should I put it? -- "more opinionated" reviews we sometimes receive. I suppose it's all yin and yang, and having to take the bad with the good. Rest assured, we will continue to work hard to stay consistent. Thank you again.
