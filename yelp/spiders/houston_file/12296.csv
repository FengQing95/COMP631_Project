JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of the best things about Jinya Ramen is its consistency. I've been here multiple times and the appetizers and ramen always taste great. The ramen broth is rich, flavorful, seasoned just right and never too salty. The noodles have a nice bite to them and are perfectly cooked every time I've been.
