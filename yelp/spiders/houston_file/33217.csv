Local Foods////Jenafer, who rang up my order, was super helpful in explaining the menu to me after she heard it was my first time there but I have a feeling she's a peach irregardless if it's your first or fourteenth time in the store. She also bestowed a bacon cupcake on me that was ingested in an embarrassingly fast rate.
