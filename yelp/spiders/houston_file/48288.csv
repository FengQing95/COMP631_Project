Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Second attempt here was successful - 7 am on Friday morning. First attempt was 10 am in a Saturday and the wait was 2 hours (eek!). Great selection and you can't go wrong with pretty much anything there. I went with one of their many selection of eggs benedict - delicious! Coffee was also good, and service was fast and friendly.
