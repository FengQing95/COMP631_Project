Local Foods////For starters, we order the Vegan Queso. It is AMAZING. It tastes like a regular queso. I am not sure of the exact ingredients that makes the queso vegan, but we found tomatoes and caramelized onions in the mix. Order more chips though because they barely give you any. The chips are also very good. For my entree, I ordered the Vegan Taco Salad. It was also very good and consisted of lots of veggies and protein!
