Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think I would go back for the Chocolate Chip Cookies with Walnuts. It is supposedly similar to Levain Bakery. I've never been to Levain Bakery. Therefore, I cannot tell you if they're similar. I did like the cookie though. It was cakey. The cookie isn't overbearing if you eat it in two sessions.
