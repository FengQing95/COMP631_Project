Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is just 'Ok'! Came here for brunch (hours are11am-3pm) with a group of my girlfriends and started off with some carafes of mimosas (bc YASSS Sunday Funday)! On the menu, the carafes were $40/carafe, but the waiter told us it was $30. I guess they haven't made the changes to their menu yet. Still,that's a lot for a carafe. Might as well do endless if we're going with those prices. The food was just mediocre. We shared the fruity pebbles french toast (it's SUPER sweet) and a lot of us had different dishes: chorizo + potato benedict, the burger, the short rib chilaquiles, etc.
