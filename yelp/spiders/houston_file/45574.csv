Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I will say the place is a bit small for the amount of popularity that it carries, so beware there is normally a line depending on what time you visit. It moves pretty quickly, but keep in mind some people are impatient and even staff can get a little snappy. Don't let it deter you from trying some of the best pastries ever! Never let one individual ruin your spirit. Anywho.... with that said, seating can be limited as well, but there is indoor and outdoor along with bar stool seating. Parking can also be a test, however, there is street parking and additional parking a block down from the caf√©. I know this is a lot, but it's best to know before you go!
