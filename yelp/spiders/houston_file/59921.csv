Baby Barnaby's////Up until recently I wasn't actually a huge breakfast fan (GASP!) ...but now that I'm on-board the egg train, I can truly appreciate how great this place is. First of all, the service is good here. Especially at this location, the servers are always friendly and seem like they're enjoying their job (even when I'm absolutely sure they are not!) Barnaby's has my absolute favorite breakfast potatoes around, so no matter what I get (or if it actually comes with potatoes) I get them. Next up, can we PLEASE talk about the migas here?! SO GOOD! Of course, you gotta add chorizo, but I'm sure they are delicious even without. I also love that each table gets its own thermos thing of coffee. Baby Barnaby's can be a little "cozy," but I honestly think that is part of its charm. Hoorayyyyyy for Barnaby's!
