Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Friend's King's pancake was equally amazing! It's not your typical pancake.. It's brightly blue and fluffy and covered in the wonderfully nutty and rich maple syrup that was surprisingly not overly sweet. The flavor is perfect for the fall. If only it was orange in color.. The pancake, which came in a stack of 3 (or 4?) is definitely a sharing size! I usually steer away from items I can easily make at home (e.g. pancake), but I'm so glad that my friend ended up ordering the pancake. It's definitely not your typical home-made pancake!
