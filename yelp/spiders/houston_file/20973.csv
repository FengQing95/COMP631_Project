Uchi////It went to my favorite restaurant into a 3 star restaurant. They changed almost everything good on their menu. From ham and eggs, to the scallop, to even fried milk?! Brussels sprouts aren't as crunchy as it use to be. Foie gras is a lot smaller.. Sigh this was a sad day for me. There's no love in the food anymore. And the servers are quick to drop the food off without explaining everything like they use to.
