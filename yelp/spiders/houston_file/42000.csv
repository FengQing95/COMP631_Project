Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Not a lot to say about this place that hasn't been said, but this is easily the most technically perfect baking in Houston, and one of the better places I've ever been.  Their breakfast torta was the breakfast torta champion of Dunlavy (sorry Guadalupana...), but for some reason they stopped serving it.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, but weekdays tend to better to avoid the ever-increasing crowds.
