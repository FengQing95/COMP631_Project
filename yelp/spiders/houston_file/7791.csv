JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Noelle - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. Our recipes are designed in such a way that the toppings contribute their own flavors and textures to the overall design of the ramen. So in regards to the Spicy Vegan Ramen, the tofu in this dish isn't supposed to bring additional flavor to the bowl, but rather, provide a soft, silky, egg-like texture.
