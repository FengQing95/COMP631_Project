Baby Barnaby's////Visiting, for my brother-in-law's (straight) wedding. Found this cute little joint. The food is superb, coffee a-plenty, the staff are the nicest people you could ever meet. Everything, from the 50s retro decor, to the orange juice machine, is both nostalgic and invigorating. An absolute gem. If we lived here, we will come every weekend.
