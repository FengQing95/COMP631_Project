Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Boss cat was cool... not to bad the few times I have gone. This last trip I went at about 3pm on a weekday and no one was really there. The bar had a few older gentlemen there and that's about it. Always good waitstaff. Drinks came quick and food was above average as usual. It's a solid place to go for a early dinner or a few drinks.
