Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been wanting to try this place. We ended up coming with large group of Mom friends for lunch. We had a wonderful time. The waiter was very nice and attentive. I regret that I didn't listen to his recommendation and went with the Havana pork dish which was not very flavorful, the meat was dry, and there was a hunk of meat on the plate. It wasn't appetizing. I did enjoy my tomato bisque and the yummy bread it came with. One of our friends got the Korean beef dish the waiter recommended and I got a taste, and it was very good. We had the bacon appetizer and of course bacon is always good. Our group enjoyed our lunch and had a fun time here. The decor is very hip and well thought out. The whiskey room is very sexy. I plan on coming back in the evening and plan something in there.
