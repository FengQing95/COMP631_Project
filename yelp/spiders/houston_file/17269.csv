JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Forgot to snap a picture, but we also got the Panna Cotta. It was a little bit more bitter than what I've had from other Jinya chains so not sure about that, but I thought it was alright. Otherwise, it's a really cool, hip place and we enjoyed the nice light bites after the heavy lunch we'd had.
