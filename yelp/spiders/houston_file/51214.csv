Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2. Quality AND Quantity: Â Who says you can't have both?! My table for two was loaded to the brim with food (6 pancakes, 4 benedicts, 1 pot pie, and several drinks... stop judging me). Even the staff was impressed with our blatant lack of self control... I mean... good taste. The portions are generous and each dish was executed beautifully. I'd call this the total package. It's 2016 - is it legal to marry Breakfast yet?
