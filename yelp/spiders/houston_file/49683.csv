Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////TIP: if you're going on a weekend be prepared to wait because it's always packed, but the wait is kind of a part of the fun if you like socializing. You can also get someone to go write your name down (no call ins allowed) and they will give you an estimate of wait time and text you before your party needs to be seated.
