Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They have a small private parking lot but if that's full, there is plenty of street parking in the surrounding neighborhood. The restaurant is filled with plenty of booths, which is great for groups, plus they have outdoor seating and a counter/bar area with stools you can snag a seat to eat at without a reservation.
