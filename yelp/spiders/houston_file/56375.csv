Kata Robata////Nom nom. This is a very nice, casual sushi place that you can go for various purposes. The ambience is modern yet classy and the restaurant is of a good size so I think you can go as a big group. Sushi is fresh, good balance between the size of fish and portion of the rice. The spider roll was a bit dry and didn't have any sauce on it, which is a little different from spider rolls that I ate at other restaurants. Spicy soy ramen had a unique flavor that I have never tasted before but liked - it has soy milk in it, which gives that creamy flavor. Service was great! Had a great time at Kata Robata.
