Uchi////Where Uchi lacks is the sushi (we tried some nigiri). The focus seemed to be more on the presentation than the quality of the fish. You can get better sushi for half the price at a number of places in Houston. This was surprising given the surge in quality of sushi restaurants in Houston over the last 2-3 years.
