JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered 3 different bowls for my first time, just so I can taste everything. Out of the Tonkatsu Spicy, Tonkatsu Black, and the chef's special Miso ramen, the black was b y far my favorite. The broth is a rice pork base with THIN noodles, which are so much better than the fat noodles. The pork is super soft and delicious, not dry at all. The only complaint I have are the additions such as the egg and the bamboo shoots. The bamboo is literally straight from a can and the egg is a normal boiled egg, smh.
