Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Man!  This place has great food and awesome service.  Terry was the best waiter.  Porkbelly Poutine, oh my slap my thigh redonkulousness.  Avocado salad was  creamy and refreshing.  Bosscat burger was good.  Fried potatoes were amazing and even the ketchup had lil spicy tang that made you say-dang thats good! Ya da boss, Bosscat.
