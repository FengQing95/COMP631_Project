JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Anh, Thank you for your review of JINYA Ramen Bar. Your feedback is appreciated as it helps us improve our business by highlighting issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. To that end, I'd like to address your recent concerns regarding the toppings you ordered with your ramen. As a Â franchise, we are contractually obligated to follow strict guidelines for food quantities, preparation and service. Therefore, the amount of toppings we offer per serving is based on predetermined-company standards. So, unfortunately, there is little we can do at this time to change that. Furthermore, we are required by our corporate offices to "import" our fresh produce from California, all of which comes at a higher cost than what we might otherwise source locally. And while you mentioned receiving a "huge plate" of bean sprouts for $1 during a previous visit, that cost has little to do with the cost of any other produce we carry, such as cauliflower, mushrooms or bok choy, as each vegetable carries a fluctuating pricepoint for us based on market availability and demand. Regardless, we still charge between $1 and $2.50 for the majority of our toppings.
