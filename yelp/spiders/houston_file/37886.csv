Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The "king " is far from what it sounds like . The dish looks great but it doesn't taste so good unfortunately. The fries were also talked up a lot by the waiter and they were generic as can be . However; the homemade ketchup was an interesting try . I'm not sure if I would ever be back for food . Perhaps drinks though
