Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great spot to check out! They serve brunch until 4 pm. You walk in and are instantly hit with a lively vibe! They have a bakery section, a place to order food, and offer a selection of coffee as well as other drinks such as beer. You order food at the front and they'll give you a number. You can choose where you want to sit and they'll bring food to you there. They had a great selection of brunch options, flatbreads, paninis and sandwiches. We'll definitely be back!
