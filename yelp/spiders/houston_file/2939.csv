JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't know much about ramen but I loved the ramen I got. Service was great, even a girl that hadn't started her shift was asking me if she could bring me something to drink since the bartender was a little busy with other customers. I can't say it's the best ramen I have had in Houston since it is the first place I try, but I can say I'm definitely going back.
