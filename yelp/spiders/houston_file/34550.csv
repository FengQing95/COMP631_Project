Local Foods////After trying many of the items on the menu, I have to say the crunchy chicken sandwich ($12) is still my favorite. There are tender chicken breast pieces, sprinkles of crushed kettle chips and nuts, pickled cucumbers, tomato slices and crunchy lettuce all held together by a soft Slow Dough pretzel bun with a light buttermilk ranch dressing. All the different textures and flavors make this unlike any other chicken sandwich. The egg truffle salad ($9.50) and the smoked salmon ($11.50) are also amazing. The gulf crab and shrimp ($13.50) has a bit of a fishy taste but tastes great otherwise. Skip the banh mi and go get one in midtown.
