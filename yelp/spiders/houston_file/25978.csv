The Pit Room////Very trendy BBQ spot.  The line was quick and the menu was short so it made it easy to order.  The only item I would have liked to see on the menu that was missing was a classic baked potato.  I got the chicken tacos which were delicious, a side of fresh Mac-n-cheese as good as my chef boyfriend makes, and a side of mustard potato salad.  Great meal!
