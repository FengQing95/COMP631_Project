Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We waited in line for about an hour and a half on a Friday and then it took another 30 minutes before we got our food. Luckily there was free coffee to curb us over while waiting. When our food came out, they accidently brought the wrong order, but they quickly fixed it and let us keep the extra plate!
