Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////ok ok... so cons, parking is a nightmare.  My friend told me that he saw a full on battle royale between  two people over his parking spot!! Park along a sidestreet and walk if there's no parking in the lot.  Plus this way you get to see a little more of the interesting neighborhood!
