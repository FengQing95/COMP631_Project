JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The space is very small and very crowded. If you walk in at a busy time, you will probably have to wait outside cause the space in there is so tiny. With the space being small and so dense with people, you'd have to scream to be able to talk to your friends cause it's so loud. The food took around 20-30 minutes to make. The ramen was really good and I guess it'll suffice for the long wait time. I would not recommend this restaurant for those who are going with a large group of people or with kids.
