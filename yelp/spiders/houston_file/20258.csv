Uchi////What really bothered me about this place, and probably gives Uchi the distinction of being the most pretentious restaurant in Houston, is how unbelievably small the portions are.  Each one is two bites.  I am not kidding.  You could get more food grazing the free samples at Central Market or Whole Foods.  And, sadly, it would be just as tasty.
