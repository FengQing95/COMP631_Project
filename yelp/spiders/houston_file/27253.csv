The Pit Room////"Ok I can add another meat but I have to take some of the brisket away." I don't understand that. We didn't want to hold the line up but I don't get why they didn't just add the 3rd meat. If we're paying for 3 meats, why does one portion need to be smaller? Maybe the dinners aren't meant to be split but it seems a little cheap imo. Either way, the guy cutting the meat isn't a pleasant person to interact with.
