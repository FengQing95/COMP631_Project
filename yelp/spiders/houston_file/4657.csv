JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jade - Thank you very much for your 5-star review! I'm glad you were able to get seated promptly. As you can imagine, that's not always the case. And you are correct -- as a high-volume, high-turnover establishment, we do our best to keep things fair for everyone who is waiting for a table.
