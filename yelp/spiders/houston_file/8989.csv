JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't eat pork so I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen (almost all the ramen were made with pork broth). I was a bit hesitant since chicken in ramen doesn't sound so appealing, but it met every bit of my expectation! I added some additional fresh garlic and spices, and it definitely hit the spot. I find myself craving this often~
