The Pit Room////Last Saturday, dark and rainy, 11:40am. We managed to get a spot in the tiny parking lot, and joined the line of patrons. We were fortunate enough to get in the door, although it was still muggy. The line snaked out the door even before noon, yet was moving decently fast - though I assume not quickly enough for the guy who, judging by the rolling suitcase, had been visiting his friends and needed to fly out soon - but clearly not before visiting the Pit Room.
