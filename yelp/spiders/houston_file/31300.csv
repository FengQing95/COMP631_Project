Local Foods////Crunchy chicken sandwich is a must try! Their sandwiches come with two sides, which are all organic and really healthy (but are still very tasty). Today I got the beets and quinoa salad with my sandwich and they were both excellent. You can also get any of their sandwiches as a salad... I haven't done that yet, but it would be really good for someone who is doing low carb/no bread. Service is always really great (and fast) and even when they are slammed they have always been super nice. Â A few people have mentioned the cost, but I think the portion sizes and the quality of the product you are getting completely justify the $10-$12 for a sandwich and sides.
