Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So am I the only one that thinks this scenario doesn't make sense? You can't get a refill if the tea is ordered "for here" and given to you in a mug but you can ask for a to go cup "for a here order" and you can get a refill of hot water since tea bag is in the to go cup?!??
