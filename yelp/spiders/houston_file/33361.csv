Local Foods////I had an hour for lunch, including Galleria traffic.  Zipped over to Local Foods with a colleague for the first time.  Line was speedy, place was full but in a good way.  I decided on the Truffle Egg Salad sandwich on a pretzel bun because a) i never turn down anything with truffles b) i wanted a "salad" but saw this so figured an egg salad would have to qualify c) um, pretzel bun, nuff said.
