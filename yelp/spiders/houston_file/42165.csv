Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love the look to this place. Their decorations and grey wall works very will with the open AC system. The lightning around the pastries works so well to bring out the color. There's an antique looking shelf that one can see as they enter the door. The shelf contains jars with the logo on them. The shelf stands out pretty nicely with the rest of the store. I had ordered a nutella filled croissant. Nothing too special but they did a nice job filling the inside of the croissant with nutella without compromising its structure. Service could've been more friendly in my opinion but overall, it was a solid experience.
