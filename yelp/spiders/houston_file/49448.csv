Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Delicious! I sat at the bar with the bartender Theresa... so nice! My family and I ordered the Benny duo (Bella Bella Benny and Benny Goodman), the OMG French Toast, and the BEAT sandwich.... everything was so good! Of everything the French toast and Benny Goodman were my favorite. Theresa also made the best peach Bellini I have ever had! I recommend making a reservation or sitting at bar because the wait was long even on a Wednesday morning!
