Kata Robata////I do give credit to the ambiance and the space. It's a cool set-up, and not as loud as some reviewers say it is. I had no problem hearing my dining companions at 8pm on a Saturday night, and there were plenty of open tables. And, as wrong as this is to say, the bathrooms smell FANTASTIC. Seriously, there is some type of vanilla incense going on in there.
