Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We really can't come here enough. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the ham and cheese baguette, my husband loves the biscuits and chicken and the coffee is just perfect. Excellent spot for those up early with kids anyway, you'll find something for everyone and you'll beat the brunch rush!
