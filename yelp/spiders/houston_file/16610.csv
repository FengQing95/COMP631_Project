JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tangy Shrimp Cilantro - Tried this one for the first time just this weekend and really enjoyed it! It's basically a tom yum base in all but name - this Thai/Japanese fusion is zesty and punchy, with strong flavors of lime, cilantro, and shrimp infusing the thin noodles. The crispy tempura shrimp were fried in a thick shell that held up to the soup. Take caution to remove the lime slices after squeezing in the juice; otherwise, the bottom gets really bitter (learned that the hard way.)
