Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food we had www really goood. We had the shrimp and grits which had a nice kick to it and the fruity pebbles French toast. The later dash was good and sweet exactly what you would expect from the name. The mimosas and bloody Mary's were excellent as well. I would suggest making a reservation if You plan to go on a weekend
