JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A couple months ago, I found a hair in my takeout and Jim, the owner, responded that it was not acceptable and there was no excuse for it, and invited us to come back. We returned to Jinya tonight for the first time since the incident and Jim and Keith, the manager, personally made sure everything was perfect and went above and beyond to make things right. It was such a positive experience and no hair is gonna ruin my love for Jinya.
