Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friends and I went to Bosscat Kitchen for one of our friends birthday! We were pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was. We ordered the spicy chicken and cheese dip and portobello mushroom fries and we were blown away at how tasty everything was. (HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH THESE APPETIZERS!!) My personal favorite was the spicy chicken and cheese dip -- SO GOOD. As for my main entree I got the shaved pork sandwich and it was also very good! The coleslaw in the sandwich was so good and added so much depth to the overall taste, same goes with the sauce they used with the pork! Just to try it my other friend and I ordered the Parmesan crusted meatloaf. Probably the most "meh" dish of all that we ordered. Other than that everything was great.
