JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Their appetizers are decently good, I did like the fried chicken nuggets and the tempura brussel sprouts. The service overall is fast and friendly along with good repeat on the orders making sure things were not misheard. The water refill and check respond time is good as well. I always have a good time here at this JINYA Ramen and I will come back when I want some ramen late at night.
