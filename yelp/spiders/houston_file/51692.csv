Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Abri-Ca-Lac-Ra mimosa and my boyfriend had the Mmm Mmm mimosa. They were so good! I wish they sold by the caraft! My boyfriend decided on the pineapple upside down pancake. I of course couldn't decide between the shrimp and grits and the OMG French Toast so the waiter suggested I get a half of each.
