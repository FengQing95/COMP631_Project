Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We've been meaning to try this place out for months, but the long wait times have always deterred us. Today was no different, we waited about 1.5 hours for a seat. Luckily they take your number and text you when you're table is ready, so we went by a local coffee shop and relaxed there. They also offer free coffee and games for their waiting patrons.
