Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The only negative was the valet. When we left my friends and I decided to only get one car because we were going somewhere close by and didn't need all three cars. We asked the valet if we could leave the other two cars and he said that was fine but that he'd give us the keys now just in case we didn't make it back in time. "Great I thought".  When the car we were taking pulled up I went to tip the valet and he said "Is this for all three cars?" I responded and said that the other two tipped the other Valets who brought the keys but as I drove off I was furious-who does that? The comment was rude and beyond inappropriate.  Trying not to speculate why he felt comfortable basically demanding a better tip from me......
