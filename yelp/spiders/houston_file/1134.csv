JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brittany - Thank you for the amazing review! We are so pleased you enjoyed our fare and had a great experience at our restaurant. Our Tonkotosu broths take a very long time to prepare, and a lot of work goes into each bowl, so it's always reassuring to hear supremely positive feedback such as yours. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again in the near future!
