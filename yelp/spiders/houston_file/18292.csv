Uchi////Excellent place. As someone who doesn't even typically like sushi, this place was an eye opener. Great flavors in all their stuff. Food is cheap in my mind compared to what you get; drinks are what will run up your bill. Food is really great, and it's a bustling place. And I guess it's not really a sushi place. Just go. It's awesome. I've never met anyone who didn't enjoy Uchi.
