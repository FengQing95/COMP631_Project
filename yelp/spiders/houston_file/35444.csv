Local Foods////It was okay. The best Local Foods is the one on Kirby. Cashew queso was alright considering it's not made of real cheese. Wouldn't buy that again though - had a werid grainy consistency and random "wateryness" from the beans and tomatoes added. I was recommended to get the Fall Harvest Salad - it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. Their best salad is the Asian Chicken. There was too much going on with the random fruits - beets, grapefruit, some sort of squash???, and chicken. Not a good mix. My boyfriend said it tasted like cat food, but after paying 18$ for a salad I had to eat it. His burger was decent. Fries big wimpy. Carrot cake was not worth the money. Not sweet enough cake, needed the icing to balance. A good carrot cake doesn't need icing. I asked if they had the same lemonade as the one on Kirby and was met with hostility. Rather disappointed. I will continue to go to Kirby and not the Rice Village location.
