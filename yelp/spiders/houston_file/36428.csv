Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Definitely worth stopping by. The staff was super friendly and the Dj played great music but not too loud so you could still easily chat. The atmosphere was cozy but still spacious. I got the 38 Special which was delicately crafted and delicious. Would definitely venture back to try the food. I was salivating just reading the menu.
