Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in for Sunday brunch. They had a wait time of 30-40 minutes but we were seated within 20. We ordered a donut burger without bacon, bosscat fries, and I customized my order of chilaquiles by adding avocado, pickled onion, and cilantro and I asked for the chips on the side. The waiter came back to let me know that there would be a $5 upcharge for my customization which was fine by me. The place was packed and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our food and the person who brought us our order was not our waiter. The first thing we noticed was that the burger had bacon. Unfortunately our waiter was nowhere to be seen but another waiter (didn't catch his name) noticed that we were looking around and asked if we needed something which was very nice of him. He took the burger back and brought out another one 5 minutes later. The fries were good, crispy on the outside with a mashed potato-like consistency on the inside, but the ketchup was very good and had an interesting flavor. The burger was ok-nothing spectacular. The chilaquiles were in dire need of salt and the pickled onions were cut too thick and too long and needed more pickling-they still had a hard bite to them. The pickled jalapenos were very good, I believe they are pickled in house because they didn't have a strong salty or briny flavor. The red sauce was very good; it had a nice smoky and spicy flavor. The green sauce was ok, nothing great. I expected more from the food, but I will be back to try their regular menu. The thing that annoyed me was the music. They had a dj with a full house and I guess he wanted the music to be heard so it was a little louder than other places.
