Uchi////On the menu, there is a Chef's Tasting option of 10 courses and a Signature Tasting option of 6 courses with prices marked as market pricing. I asked the chef beforehand how much they would be for that night, which the Chef replied $125 per person on the Signature Tasting, and I don't recall the other pricing. We chose two Signature Tastings and had an amazing night of wonderful food. The dishes included, but were not limited to, sashimi, nigiri, 36 hour sous vide beef nigiri, tiny fried crabs, brussell sprouts, desserts. The chef really does give you their best wares and it was one of the better nights of sushi I have had here in Texas. Favorites of the night were: gyutoro, flounder muscle, shima aji, uni, and the baby crabs just because they looked cool. *See footnote at bottom.
