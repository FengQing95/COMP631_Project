JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm not a big fan of ramen, but I really like Jinya's dishes. I always get the chicken ramen. Sometimes I order the spicy one. Â It's very tasty. Has a lot of flavor. I like the atmosphere. It's very casual yet modern looking. Their service is great and everyone's very friendly. I definitley recommend it!
