Kata Robata////I've been looking for a quality sushi place in Houston for awhile, and Kata Robata really exceeded my expectations. I had a business lunch here with two colleagues. We made a reservation, and I'm glad we did. We arrived at 12:30, and for the next hour, every table was completely full.
