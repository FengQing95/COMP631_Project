Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Never bothered to check this place out, thinking it was a sleep shop by the sound of it.  Finally, the opportunity presented itself to give it a try.  The atmosphere is lounge-y, the food is pretty (but good) while the portions are dainty.  Wide variety of brunch-y dishes with their own special touch.  `
