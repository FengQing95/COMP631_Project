The Pit Room////Hands down my favorite BBQ place in Houston. Staff is very friendly, and even asked me how I liked my brisket before choosing which cut to give me, which I really appreciated and thought was so thoughtful. I usually get the brisket, and I swear, it's so amazing. Their Mac n cheese is amazing and the cheese sauce that it's in is what makes it so great. Definitely worth going and trying if you're in the mood for great BBQ!
