Local Foods////When you order a sandwich, you can also opt for two sides.  I typically order the couscous and the kale.  The quinoa and beet sides are all right, and I don't particularly care for the cabbage slaw.  I loved the orzo, but they stopped making it a few months ago.  Bring back the orzo!!
