Kata Robata////This place was awesome! We started with the 72-hour steak dish--and this was just to die for! We also enjoyed a pork belly dish, two sashimi dishes and three sushi dishes. And all of this was accompanied by premium hot sake (discounted on Monday nights) and beer. Stand outs were--the steak, the amberjack sashimi (delicious sashimi wrapped around foi gras, yes please!) and a truffle topped sushi roll. I wish I could be more descriptive of these dishes, but I honestly don't know what everything was, as we kind of just put our trust in the waiter and took most of his recommendations. All in all, great evening with great food and drinks--missing the last star just because it was a very expensive evening for us--definitely on the pricier side, but if you go in knowing you will be paying more than normal and just let yourself enjoy it anyway, you'll have a great night!
