Uchi////Let me preface this review by saying, Uchi is a fusion sushi restaurant. Their happy hour menu is full of flavor that will appeal to everyone. We ordered a few appetizers, brussels sprouts, an escolar plate called walu walu, the yellowtail and pear plate called machi cure, uchivichie, and lastly we received a free order of edamame considering a mistake in our sashimi order. All of these starters had definition and flavor, but were not my cup of tea.
