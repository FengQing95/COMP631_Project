Local Foods////I so wanted to like this place, great Yelp reviews and delicious looking pics, but I just did not like most of what I sampled at all. Went here with three other girlfriends and was able to sample what everyone got. The crunchy chicken sandwich was a little bland and not anything I would come back for. The steak and egg sandwich had an odd sweet taste to the meat which I'm generally not opposed to but with the eggs it was not appealing. The only thing less appetizing was the quinoa burger with its horribly mush texture, like eating mud. The only saving grace of the meal with the pretzel buns everything came on and the egg salad sandwich, now that I would eat again.  Overall pretty disappointing.  I have no plans to return here.
