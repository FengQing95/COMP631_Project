Uchi////I was a little nervous about my first experience. I don't eat anything that lives in the water (most sushi) so I looked at the menu beforehand to see what I could have. I didn't recognize half of the ingredients. So I went hesitantly. I was extremely impressed. We started with the Brussels sprouts and edemame. Both were incredible. We ordered five dishes from the tasting menu to split between two of us. They were all tasty but we both could not get enough of the ham and egg. We ordered another order of it planning on splitting it with the couple we were with, we devoured it within minutes, opps. The pricing was extremely reasonable, but we went during happy hour. The regular pricing is a bit too high for our normal routine. We will definitely be back and be bringing friends, but it will have to be during happy hour.
