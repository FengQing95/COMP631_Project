Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Atmosphere - Common Bond Cafe & Bakery has an interesting setup.  As you walk up, you'll most likely be greeted by a long line (especially on weekends).  As you make your way inside, the left side is a restaurant for those who want to enjoy breakfast with table service.  There's also an espresso bar.  On the right, you'll find a long line of baked goodies that will transport you back in time when you were a kid stepping foot into a candy store for the first time.  You will drool.  I promise.  1 Star.
