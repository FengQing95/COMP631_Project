Uchi////Server did an exceptional job. If you like highly sweetened Brussel sprout, order it. Too sweet for my taste. Foie gras was on point. Sashimi was ok. Can not beat Sea Urchin from Kata Robata. It was very busy at 5pm, of course. It was an expensive lesson learned. Give them a try, everyone's taste buds are different.
