Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We went on a weekday morning, so it wasn't really busy (it does get really busy on the weekends, so make a reservation!) I got a chai and eggs benedict, and the eggs benedict tasted really good. The chai was especially good-they gave the option for a spicier chai or sweeter chai, and I went for the sweeter chai. My friend got the pineapple upside down pancake and not only is it unique, it tastes good too! The menu gives you a lot of options, and the atmosphere is friendly and light-definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch!
