Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was so surprised my favorite brunch restaurant in Denver came to Houston. Immediately went and loved how the food tastes just as great! I ordered the Bella Bella Benedicts and my friend ordered the original breakfast with the pancakes of the day (Orange creamsicle). Everything was great! My eggs perfectly poached. The yolk mixed with the hollandaise sauce deliciously, add the arugula and you have an explosion of flavor in your mouth. The original breakfast was perfect as well. Crunchy bacon, fluffy eggs, and crunchy but perfectly cooked hash browns. The pancake was sweet but not overly so. I can't wait to come back and have the pancake trio!
