Uchi////The host at the door was rude to us stating that we could not wait in the entrance and had to go to the bar BUT that we could not get our table either because the party was not fully there. I don't mind waiting at the bar, now if the bar is full and I just want to stand 5min in the entrance with my wife, I should not be told to move out in a rude manner. Your work for a luxury restaurant, not IHOP.
