The Pit Room////I said WoW after my first bite of brisket. That's all you need to hear from me to know this place is legit!?! It's now saved in my road trip Favs! The sides are so good too. I started with those to see how they fair. Well, so far this place is Fantastic! The brisket is so soft and flavorful that you need only a tongue to taste and chew it.
