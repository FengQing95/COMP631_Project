Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came in for brunch Â w/a large group today (~25 ppl) and really had a fun time! The food was great, and the service was awesome! Terry and Breanne (sp?) really took care of us. I know serving big groups can be challenging, but they made it light and fun, quickly resolving any issues that popped up.
