The Pit Room////Get there early because they do run out of stuff.  They were out of turkey on the Friday we went.  In all fairness it was around 12:45, so the initial lunch rush had already occurred. There ended up being a second rush after we went through the line.  We were able to get a table, but I could see it being difficult if they are super busy.  I went with the two meat combo.  For my meats, I went with the pulled pork & the brisket and my buddy went with the sausage & brisket. I liked my pork a lot and the brisket was nice and lean with a nice char outside.  The sauce could have been thicker, but overall I really liked the flavor.  My buddy was not as impressed, he was a little disappointed with the sausage.  There were a decent amount of sides to choose from, I went with the mac & cheese (decent, but nothing to return for) and the coleslaw.  It was really good and tasted home made.
