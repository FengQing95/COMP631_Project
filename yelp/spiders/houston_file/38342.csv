Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My girlfriend and I decided to give this establishment a go for their cocktails, needless to say, I think we were unimpressed. I know they have a wide selection of bourbon and whiskey to choose from, but the old fashioned drink I ordered was mediocre at best. We may give this place another try for their food and other libations. Aside from the drinks, the ambiance and decor inside were lively and well appointed.
