JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was a weekday and I was mentally drained from work, so when my friend initially asked me to grab dinner my answer was 'no'. But then she offered to get my first cocktail and told me it was a ramen spot that I could review. Honestly, she had me in the palm of her hand when she offered to get my first cocktail. (I know, it doesn't take much. I'm slightly ashamed - well, not really.) This was my first time trying Ramen. I mean I've had that kind from the grocery store that cost a mere $.30, but never had I been to an actual ramen restaurant. Here's my first encounter with Jinya Ramen Bar.
