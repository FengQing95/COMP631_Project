Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It took over 5 minutes to get a glass of water and menus. It took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come over and take our orders; I ordered the "B.E.A.T Sandwich" and an orange juice, my mom ordered the "I Want Sum'oa Cakes" and coffee. 20 minutes, and no water refills, later our food arrived.
