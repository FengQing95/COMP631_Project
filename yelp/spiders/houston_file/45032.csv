Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////first impression, wow this place was packed on a Sunday morning when I visited for the first time! The line was out the door however, the line moved on pretty quickly. This is a good place to have brunch as well, but this time around our group only had coffee and pastries since we were going to grab lunch right after.
