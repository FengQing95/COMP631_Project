Baby Barnaby's////Green Eggs (4/5): My friends and all usually get their green eggs (two eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke hearts, and jack cheese with chicken apple sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast).  My recommendation: sub the toast for biscuits.  This is my tried and true option here.  Also, I like the spice that they put on their potatoes.
