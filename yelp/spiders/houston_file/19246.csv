Uchi////I thought the Machi Cure was a fun dish. It first starts out awkward as you initially get that yuuca chip taste but then as you chew the smoked hamachi and almonds really bring it in for a home run. The carpaccio's super clean and light flavors left me wanting several servings more. Things got awkward as everyone was chopstick fencing for that last bite.
