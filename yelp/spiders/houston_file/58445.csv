Baby Barnaby's////Not only did it take an inordinate amount of time to get our waters, place our order, and get our food, but we had to wait (at least 7 minutes) to get our check. The waiter obviously ignores people when they are trying to flag him down (because he's so busy with his other tables, because they are so short-staffed), and not only that, another waiter just straight WAVED his hand "hello" at us when we were trying to ask for the check because he did Not want to come over and help us.
