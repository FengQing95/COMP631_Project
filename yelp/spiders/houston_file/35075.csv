Local Foods////What was different that we tried that I have never tried before was the Vegan Queso with vegan "meat" crumbles. Im not really into Vegan cheese that much because it tends not to be melted right or has a weird taste, but man this has totally changed my mind. The "cheese" was made from cashews I believe, and the meat was either soy crumbles or a beyond meat type product, but either way, the seasoning in it made it taste like a traditional queso. It was pretty good and we finished it before any of our other food came out.
