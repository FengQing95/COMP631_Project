Baby Barnaby's////The hostess that day was not so pleased that we needed an outdoor table (although I had called ahead and explained our situation and she confirmed that they were cleaning up the outdoor seating after the breakfast rush and a table would be ready in "10 minutes"). Â Once we arrived, she changed her story and said she wasn't sure she could let us sit outside if it was sprinkling because the "server might get wet", which is funny because we couldn't see any uncovered portion of the building from the restaurant to the covered patio but sure...begrudgingly, she eventually decided to seat us.
