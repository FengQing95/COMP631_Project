Uchi////I was born and raised in Tokyo and grew up eating authentic sushi so I was excited to go. We had a great experience (thank you Kim & Chris) who gifted us this dinner. Between Chelsea who took care of our beverages and Nicole who took care of our food orders at the sushi bar we had great service and enjoyed our meal! Nicole gave us great suggestions and our favorties included Machi Cure, Gyutoro, Unagi, Ikura, Zero Sen, Sake Toro and Karaage. (Perfect rice, Jason!) Suffice it to say we overate but left happy...already starting a list of what we want to order next time! Brussel Sprouts is definitely on the list! For two of us (at the sushi bar) it came to around $175 including tip but it was well worth it.
