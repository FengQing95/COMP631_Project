Local Foods////Before the Duck Confit came back, I had been hooked on the Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich. Mmm definitely my 2nd favorite. Pretzel bun really makes this sandwich. My toughest decision, in life, is whether to get soup or sides..and then which sides? Tuscan Kale side is definitely one of my must haves. Sometimes, being the indecisive fatty that I am, I get both the sides & soup. #firstworldproblems
