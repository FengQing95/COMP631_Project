JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love coming to jinya. Between take out and dining in, I eat there at least once a week. The ramen is delicious, especially the spicy chicken ramen and the shrimp tempura. Cannot recommend it enough. However, lately, I've had a lot of issues with my orders. The last time I dined in, I was the only person sitting at the bar and my server forgot 3 different things with my order and it took me awhile to flag her down. The past 2 times I ordered to go, it either didn't come with chicken for the chicken ramen or I asked for it spicy and it came regular. As much as I love this place and won't stop coming here, it gets frustrating sometimes! I would recommend confirming your to go orders before leaving
