The Pit Room////Best barbecue in all of Texas! The meat is cooked and smoked to perfection! I get the brisket every time I go! They also have the best potato salad in Houston! They offer great iced coffee and even big red (which is my favorite!) the prices are great for the quality and amount of food you get! If they offer green beans on the day you go, highly recommend you get those too!
