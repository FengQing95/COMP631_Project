Uchi////The fish is of the highest quality, and is on your table 16 hours after being purchased at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo.  Unbelievable freshness, melt-in-your-mouth consistency, just an explosion of flavor.  And the rice really is the best in the world.  I love the salty taste of soy sauce on my sushi, but the subtle interplay of flavors in the sushi should be eaten with no interference.
