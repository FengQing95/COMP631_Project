Kata Robata////Love this place... have been coming here for years and every visit has always leave me HAPPY! The sushi is so fresh and their rolls are amazing. Don't forget to try their ramen, the broth is absolutely delicious. I can eat easily eat 2 bowls but I only order 1 so I can leave rooms for the others dishes. It's a great place for family & friends gathering, date nite or even an anniversary. Service is always on point and the staff are very friendly. They get busy on the weekends so the wait can long. Go give them a try if you haven't. You won't be disappointed.
