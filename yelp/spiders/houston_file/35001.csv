Local Foods////Finding a good chicken salad sandwich is a tough chore for some reason. It seems like so many restaurants offer them, but few deliver a quality product. This place hit the mark, with a great side of house made chips. Both were plentiful for the cost of the meal. Both could have been improved a little more though with more consistent seasoning. There was great seasoning on half of each, and the other side was a little bland. If is had been throughout, it would have been a great meal. Given that so many people on this site have five stars to this establishment, I will come back again to try the other menu offerings as well.
