Kata Robata////You have to make reservations in advance! Parking lot was full on a Sunday but seating was fast and easy with the rsvp. Our waiter Steven Lo was very friendly and helpful with the menu selection. Â We enjoyed everything we ordered. The texas beef was unfortunately sold out. The whole squid was cooked well, not too chewy and overcooked. The bone marrow was tasty. The best was the Hawaiin amberjack with foie gras; it's unlike anything I've ever tasted! Overall enjoyed our dining experience! Will have to come back for the beef!
