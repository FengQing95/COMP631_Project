Kata Robata////The cocktails have unusual ingredients and sound delish, but ranged from bland to yuck.  Ordered the tofu as an appetizer, which came out slimy and stuck to the plate so you couldn't pry it off with the chopsticks without making a mess.  It was also 'meh' on taste.  Everything was tiny-tiny except for the price.  After spending close to $50 each, we stopped at Wataburger on the way home.  Won't be going back.
