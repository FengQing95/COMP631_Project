Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Experience: Once I entered the cafe, there was workers who greeted us and explained how to order items and such (this is my first time). The amount of pastries that was on display looked great! After ordering a lavender latte (it tastes good according to my friend), hot cocco (which was really awesome), a pastry which looks like a muffin but tastes like a croissant mixed with creme brûlée, and a breakfast entree consist of duck breakfast with eggs and toast, there was great tables and such.
