Kata Robata////Hostess around 8:30 pm 11/07/2020 was really rude. They originally sat my party, a party of 2, at a big table for six. I indicated that we were having a date night since we are celebrating my job promotion, wanted something a little private. So I asked if we can have a table for two but they sat us all the way in the annex when there were other booths available in the main dining room. While I was asking both hostesses gave me a really rude look and rolled their eyes at me too. I used to work as a hostess at a fine dining restaurant and this is not the kind of service that a nice restaurant like this should have. This is not our first time here so I am disappointed with our experience last night. Our server was amazing and took care of us. But the hostesses need to be more friendly and courteous towards paying customers.
