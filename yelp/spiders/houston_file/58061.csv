Kata Robata////Honestly, the best thing here was the lobster sando. It's simply delicious! The salad was kind of bland, the uni king crab spoon would honestly be a lot tastier without a vinaigrette - it needs some other compliment, just not the daishi vinaigrette it comes with. Same for the rising sun roll. It could be better with a truffle oil concoction rather than a vinaigrette maybe.
