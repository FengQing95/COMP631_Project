Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love this place, but I hate the wait time. If you're going to go here, go on a weekday or super early. It's not uncommon for there to be an hour long wait time. The food here is so good and tastes like warm hugs so it's definitely on the top of my list of brunch places. I enjoy their wide variety of eggs benedict and you have the option to choose 2 different ones if you're indecisive or just want to try more than 1. The ancient grains benny was surprisingly very good and flavorful. Try this if you want to have a different eggs benedict experience. You won't regret it. They also have some bomb pancake options. My favorite so far is their matcha pancake. It wasn't too sweet and didn't require any syrup since they put a matcha sauce on top of it. This was offered for only a limited time, but I sure do hope they bring it back.
