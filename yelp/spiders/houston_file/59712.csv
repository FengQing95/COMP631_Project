Baby Barnaby's////Parking can be difficult due to having only street parking,  and you will likely have to wait as it is a very small place.  We waited about 30 minutes. Once seated,  the service was quick and friendly.   I ordered the green eggs with coffee, son got pancake sausage links and potatoes.
