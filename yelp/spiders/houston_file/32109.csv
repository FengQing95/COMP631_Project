Local Foods////LOVED LOVED LOVED this place! Found it on yelp and had the crispy chicken sandwich, so delicious.the duck sandwhich, melts in your mouth! And Posole which was okay but this once New Mexican I think they should probably rethink this soups name, not a Posole. They also have this delicious "mint-ade" drink they make in house it was so refreshing and flavorful it was like an explosion of flavor with every sip- this will definitely be a spot I go to every time I visit Houston, I can't wait for my next visit, I'm craving that drink!!!
