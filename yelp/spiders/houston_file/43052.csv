Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was not wowed by Common Bond before and they've gotten less impressive. I went around noon on a weekday for a coffee and snack. Order 2 macaron and a latte. The Nutella macaron was all one weird dry texture, not good for $2.75. The salted caramel one was good.
