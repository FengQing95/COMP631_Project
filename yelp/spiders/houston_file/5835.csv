JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Stacy - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm so glad you had a good experience with us and were able to try an array of options. And thank you, as well, for understanding that your server had to take care of a personal matter during service. My manager Keith explained that situation to me, and while your server had someone else cover his section during that 5-minute period, I'm glad he was able to inform you, as well.
