Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First visit to this coffee shop and bakery. From beginning to end, all of the employees were very nice and friendly, even though we stayed until they were closing. We arrived there an hour before they closed, so the dessert/pastry selection was pretty sparse. My boyfriend and I snagged a blueberry lemon parfait, a chocolate pastry, and tried some macaroons: vanilla, matcha/lychee, and the Mexican chocolate. Our fave was the Mexican chocolate....:-) this is a must! Will definitely be returning.
