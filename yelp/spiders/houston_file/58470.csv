Baby Barnaby's////The Green Eggs and Ham breakfast (sub bacon for the apple wood chicken sausage) is TO. DIE. FOR.  If it weren't for the pesky weekend wait this would be a full 5 stars.  And considering it's Houston we're dealing with, waiting outside can be seriously brutal in the heat.  They do provide self serve ice water and coffee for the people toughing it out, but I would opt for one of the other Barnaby's if it's not too late (the others stop serving breakfast at 11am).  And I'll say there have been late mornings after a late night that I've decided that it's worth the wait to get the breakfast/brunch when I have the craving bad, but not always.
