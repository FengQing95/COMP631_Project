JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were just getting together with a group of friends for dinner, and Jinya was suggested and I had not been to this location ever and wanted to check it out. It was a Saturday night and social distancing seating. It was also very busy and we went at like 9 PM and it still had a 25 minute wait.
