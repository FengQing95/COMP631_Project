Baby Barnaby's////This place was great! Had breakfast there this morning (around 10 am), and I am hooked. We only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The food was excellent - I especially liked the breakfast potatoes. Reasonable pricing and a cool, laid-back atmosphere which makes you want to return!
