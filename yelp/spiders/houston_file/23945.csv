Uchi////They have a daily specials menu that is worth perusing each time, usually consisting of an assortment of their freshest seafood (see "Tsukiji Selection"). Their regular menu is a breakdown of cool / hot food, along with an omakase (market price) tasting, tempura, and agemono (deep fried food). Having sampled a decent bit of their menu, I can attest their spread is uber fresh, versatile, and well executed. Don't forget about their cocktails, which are expertly crafted and are worth coming for without ordering food.
