Uchi////One strange thing did occur right before we left: a young lady came with a group of friends, and apparently this woman was allergic to rice.  Why they decided to bring her to Uchi, I will never understand.  Why she decided to try and eat there, instead of just grabbing a Jack in the Box taco on the way to dinner, I will also never understand.  However, she informed the waiter that she had a rice allergy, and the waiter claimed that the chef refused to modify any of the rice dishes to be served without rice since that would ruin the integrity of this culinary vision.  I get it, the food is perfect.  You don't eff with perfect.  Allergies, though, are nothing to be messed with, and I feel like there should have been a way to find middle ground.
