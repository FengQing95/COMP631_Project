The Pit Room////Side note: based on GPS maps we decided to take the red line here from downtown and after getting off the metro the first half of the walk to Pit is not a great area and we didn't exactly feel safe. I would not take that route again and would instead Uber/Lyft or take the two bus option from downtown.
