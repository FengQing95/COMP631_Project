Uchi////I arrived about 10 minutes before opening without a reservation and a line was already forming. The hosts/hostesses took down names for the wait list and passed out delicious sushi samples. If your entire party is not there within 15 minutes, they will give your table away and may have to wait a lot longer for the next available table. We were seated right away, and the entire restaurant filled up very quickly. Our server, Matt, was great and knew his stuff. We just ate 'chef's selection style' and had him surprise us, and every single item brought to the table was amazing from a few types of nigiri, sashimi, raw oysters, and this incredibly tasty broth with a coconut milk base. Cucumber sake cocktail was delicious as was the other sake selections. Overall great dining experience and will definitely return!
