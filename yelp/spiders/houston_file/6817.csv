JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jessica, Thanks for your review. For more than a year, I researched the world of authentic Japanese ramen before deciding to open JINYA in my hometown of Houston. And in my visits to more than 50 ramen shops worldwide, I have concluded that each is unique in its own way, from the way they prepare their noodles to the price points they target -- some restaurants charge as little as $8 for a bowl of ramen, while other high-end places charge as much as $20.
