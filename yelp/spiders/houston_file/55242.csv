Kata Robata////For entrees we shared several sushi rolls as well as the lobster mac n cheese. Ok the sushi was fresh and delicate but hands down the Mac n cheese was the best I've eaten anywhere. I know-- you don't think of Mac n cheese at an Asian restaurant! There were large chunks of lobster present and the cheese sauce was creamy without being heavy.
