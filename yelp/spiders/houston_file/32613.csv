Local Foods////I was looking forward to the crunchy chicken sandwich, but was a little let down. The chicken was less flavorful than I thought it would be, but I still thought it was a decent sandwich. The crunchiness came from their house chips placed into the sandwich, which was an interesting concept, not one that I really gravitated towards. I think I was expecting a more interesting chicken, but it was very basic. It's not a bad sandwich by any means, just not what I was expecting. I thought it would be a lot crunchier, but by the time I got to tasting it, the chips had sogged up a little bit.
