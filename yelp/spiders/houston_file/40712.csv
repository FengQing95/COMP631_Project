Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the shaved pork sandwich and the Bosscat fries. The stuff on the sandwich was a crunchy, dry and flavorless mystery. I gave up on the sandwich because it was just gross. I filled up on the fries which were not like any fries I've ever had before. They were huge wedges with a greasy crispy outer crust that I didn't enjoy at all. I was very sad sitting there with my meal watching my husband go nom nom nom on his catfish.
