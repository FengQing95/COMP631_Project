Kata Robata////Really good. We loved the Ocean Picante, which had just enough kick to it. The tropical spicy tuna practically melted in your mouth. Gyoza as a starter was delicious but we got 4 pieces, which felt more like a tease than a starter. Another plus - my husband's double scotch was a proper drink, not a thimbleful - always a good sign!
