Local Foods////I ordered the duck confit  and crunchy chicken sandwiches. My sides were the quinoa, tuscan kale, beets, and homemade chips. I thought that the sides were the main events and the sandwiches were really good but not fantastic. The quinoa was out-freaking-standing! The kale was super tasty but mine had to much parmesan on it.
