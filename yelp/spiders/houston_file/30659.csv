The Pit Room////I came here with the intentions of getting barbecue but ended up getting seafood because it smelled so good. I ended up getting the boiled crab and shrimp. The seasoning was very spicy and they did not boil the seafood inside of the seasoning they just poured it on top as you can see in the picture. I was also disappointed by how small the crab cluster was and the shrimp advertised on their Instagram was not the shrimp provided. The food was actually cold but I didn't send it back because I was so hungry.
