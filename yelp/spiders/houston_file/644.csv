JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place blew me away. Was craving ramen and was going to settle for the usual cup from Walmart but one of my friends suggested this sweet place and I couldn't help but fall in love. It was cheap, filling, and delightful. I recommend the spicy ramen :) if you're a ramen lover, you have to make a trip here!
