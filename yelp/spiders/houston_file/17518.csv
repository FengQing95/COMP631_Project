Uchi////Last night, I hosted a going away party at Uchi.  A valued coworker had left our company and we wanted to do something nice for her.   So I made reservations and my own team arrived promptly at 4:40 pm to wait in line.  Once Uchi opened, we were seated at booth in the bar area. Another coworker arrived and the manager was kind enough to seat us at a larger five-person table in the bar area.  At 6:55 pm, our waitress unexpectedly refused to serve us.  No warning.  No reason.  No comments about our dress.  No warning about our behaviour.  I understand the law and policies very well.  But I do expect a bit of common decency.  When I choose your establishment for a party, I do expect to be treated properly.  Please tell me why I am being asked to leave.  Own your decision !  Do not send a waitress to execute your task.  At the very least, do not waste my time. Poorly run restaurant with weak management.
