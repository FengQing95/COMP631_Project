JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First, I'm sorry your table wasn't properly cleaned when you sat down. That is unacceptable, and I have spoken to our bussers, most of whom are usually on point. May I ask if there was any possibility that you were seated before the table was ready? I only ask because sometimes when we're very busy, our hostesses will accidentally bring guests to open seats before they have been prepared properly. I only posit this since your review is the first mention of an unclean table in more than 500 Yelp reviews -- I want to nip this in the bud with my staff before it can happen again.
