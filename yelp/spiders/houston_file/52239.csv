Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was great, the pancakes were a lot heavier than I remember but still very enjoyable! I will say the egg that I got for like 2 or 3 dollars I believe was very small. I really don't think it should be that small for the price. The mimosas we got were also warm and we ended up not finishing them.
