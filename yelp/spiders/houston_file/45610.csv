Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Unfortunately, Common Bond was out of their signature Shrimp and Grits when I arrived. Fortunately, the Nashville Hot Chicken was there  to save the day. Difficult to focus on ordering an entrée due to the glass dessert display stealing your attention.  5 stars
