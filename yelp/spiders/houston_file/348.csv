JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regardless of culpability, I am sorry you had to deal with the delay, and if you are willing/able to give us another chance -- and I hope you do -- please ask for me, or my general manager Keith, and we will make sure your experience is vastly superior to this one. But if you decide otherwise, I fully respect your decision, and can only ask that you accept our sincere apology.
