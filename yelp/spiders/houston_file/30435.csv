The Pit Room////I had the 3 meat dinner which came with 2 sides. I had the Pork Ribs, Brisket and the Beef Sausage (Czech style and homemade). For sides I had the mac n cheese and the mustard potato salad). Â My wife had the brisket and the Elote (roasted corn, covered with a creamy topping, spices, fresh lime, and plenty of cheese ) as a side dish. Each dish was served with the obligatory white bread slice, white onions and dill pickle chips.
