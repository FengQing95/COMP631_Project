Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pompous, obnoxious and over-inflated sense of product. The people are rude, we brought our extremely well behaved children and they made no attempt to correct the fact that one yogurt was missing blueberries. So as any of us with children know, if one has it they both want it. When I asked they said it doesn't come with blueberries. When I showed them that clearly one came with them, they said it was a mistake. No attempt was made to resolve the situation even after asking the head bozo. The people are all a$$holes, the food is very forgettable, and the cuisine perfectly reflects the management, unsophisticated, simple, pretentious and lacking in all elements of substance.
