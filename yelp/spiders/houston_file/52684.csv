Kata Robata////Hm. Interesting place since the rolls have a nonjapanese twist. 5 points for pork belly buns. 1 point for some nonsense of not allowing my friend to sit at the table until I arrived ( totally noncurteous )despite having reservations; I bet they would not have done this to a man. Â 4 points for service and 4 points for the rolls. 5 for ambience and 3 for sashimi. Not bad, but this is not nobu in NYC:)
