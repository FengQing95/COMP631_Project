Kata Robata////DISCLAIMER** i think uchis and uchikos in Austin has forever ruined sushi for me. I've come to expect that level of food at every fusion sushi place so maybe this review will be a bit harsh. A lot of reviewers have compared kata robata to uchis and let me tell you its pretty far off. Surprisingly the best dishes I had were non seafood related.
