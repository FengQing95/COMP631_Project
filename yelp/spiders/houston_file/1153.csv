JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The pork broth is delicious and they even offer a chicken ramen broth. I had the thick noodles which are read on another yelper's review that they were more tasty. I have to say I agree! You do have to pay for the egg. We also had the friend Brussels sprouts and they were pretty good.
