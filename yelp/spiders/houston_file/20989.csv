Uchi////If I could eat sushi everyday, I definitely would. I LOVE sushi. So I know of a couple hidden gems around town where I enjoy getting sushi at. My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday, I thought we'd definitely be treated a bit different since we were super casual. But they offered us the BEST SERVICE. Now let's move on to the food, small bites, I thought, oh man this will def be a pricey dinner. But it was reasonable. Typical sushi price but I have NEVER had sushi this fresh and SO GOOD! I was so amazed and impressed. I loved everything about this place(except parking). TRY IT. I will be coming back!
