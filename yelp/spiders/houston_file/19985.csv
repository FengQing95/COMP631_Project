Uchi////Let me preface this review by saying I am a sushi snob.  Have been to japan multiple times, have had multiple michelin rated restaurants in japan and NYC.   However I am not from japan, nor am I japanese.  My favorite cuisine is japanese and i believe ive got over 100 reviews on just japanese restaurants alone, Ive obviously dined at more.
