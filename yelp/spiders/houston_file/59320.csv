Baby Barnaby's////Every Sunday morning, I awake thinking about the last time we met.  So I get in my car and drive across town so I can wait in line for 30 minutes to an hour, sit inside a tiny little run down building (or outside if I feel like waiting longer), and anxiously await your return.  Sometimes I like to add jalepenos to you, and sometimes egg whites, either way, you are always just as good.  Your friend, the chicken apple sausage, while not the main event, is just as delectable.  Green eggs, you never disappoint, I can always rely on you to be yummy and make my hangovers go away.
