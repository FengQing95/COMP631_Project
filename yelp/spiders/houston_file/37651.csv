Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Drinks are very delicious and creative. Highly recommend trying the Southsider if you are a gin lover. BC lemonade is refreshing. Appetizers are very good, especially the flatbread and pork candy. The brick chicken is tender inside with crispy finishes. The staff are very friendly and the decor is unique. It's a cool spot for happy hours and lively dinners with friends.
