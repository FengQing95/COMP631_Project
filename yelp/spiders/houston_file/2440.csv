JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Todd - Thanks for your great review. We appreciate your kind words. If I may be so bold, upon your next visit, I recommend our Spicy Chicken Ramen (if you're okay with spicy food, ask for the "Spicy" level), or the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. I would say those are two of our most popular ramen dishes. I'd be a bad business owner if I didn't say I was very confident we will earn your 5th star after future visits. But I suppose the proof will be in the ramen. Thank you again and we look forward to serving you again soon.
