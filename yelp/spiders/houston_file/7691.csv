JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had several visits here. Service is always consistent and up to their standard. Tried almost half of ramen menu but my all-time favorite are still premium tonkotsu white and cha cha cha. The flavor and quality of their broth and topping represent their reputation and proud in ramen culture.
