Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Even with a reservation, we waited 15 minutes to be seated. The timing of the courses was very fluid; we never once felt rushed, nor did we ever wonder where the next course was. The amuse-bouche was a sunflower rye cracker topped with foie gras mousse and a black cherry. It sufficiently teased our appetites and left us wanting more. The market vegetables were a colorful mix that included Brussels sprouts, radish, carrots, and apples. Â Light and refreshing.
