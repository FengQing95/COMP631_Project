Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went specifically to try their Macarons. They are huge (biggest I've seen so far) and are at $2.50 each. As for the flavor, they tasted alright, but the cookie was pretty dense and not as light and flaky as others that I've tried. I have tried at least six different macaron places in Houston so I'm thinking the consistency of the cookie should be light. (?) Anyway, I will be returning because they have this nifty coffee bar and the bread looked amaze.
