Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok. I've given this place 3 tries now. 3 strikes. 1. Service is slow. Though the waitstaff is friendly. My food was cold. 2. Food was bland and poorly prepared every time. There's nothing special. 3. Parking! This place is overrated, overpriced, and underwhelming. I would not recommend.
