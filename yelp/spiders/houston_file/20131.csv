Uchi////I wasn't terribly excited over the two things I ordered (beet salad, nothing to write home, er, Yelp, about) and a decent vegetarian sushi roll wrapped in soy paper that was quite tasty, certainly in the league of similar rolls that I've had before in other cities. Upon hearing that I'm a vegetarian, our very friendly waitress told me about the substitutions for making rolls vegetarian. The "protein" (her word, not mine) is fruit or vegetables that didn't sound too enticing and I didn't want to spend the $8-12 per item to find out if it was yet more average. I get it. It's a sushi restaurant. Yet here I am, a lover of sushi for sure, as sushi is not only about the raw fish (sashimi, OTOH...)
