Baby Barnaby's////I am not sure what took me so long to write a review for this Montrose staple. As Julia Child said, "In the 1960s, you could eat anything you wanted, and of course, people were smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, and there was no talk about fat and anything like that, and butter and cream were rife. Those were lovely days for gastronomy, I must say." Barnaby's is not exactly what comes to mind when you think of gastronomy but they have done something amazing with their salads. I am not one to rant and rave about salads but their salads are mind-blowing amazing. Brunch is always a hit with friends. Make sure you get here early on the weekends if you don't want to wait.
