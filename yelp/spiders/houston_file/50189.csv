Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But when it comes to all the other food I, personally, don't think that much of it is anything special to wait for. I'm not saying that it's not good or anything, it is all very tasty, but it shouldn't be food that causes a 1.5 to 2 HOUR wait... their pancakes, maybe... the ridiculous wait times combined with okay food are the causes for the loss of one star each.
