Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has gotten so much hype even before the grand opening and it did not disappoint!  It is located off Montrose and Dunlavy.  The interior of the building is gorgeous with floor to ceiling windows with plenty of natural lighting.  The undone ceiling gives it an industrial vibe.  The baked goodies are displayed in modern glass cases.  From the counter, you can look directly into the kitchen through clear glass and watch where the magic happens.  Off to the side of the bakery is the coffee bar where the baristas pump out high quality cold/hot beverages.  Tables are a bit hard to come by, but there's plenty of counter seating with barstools.
