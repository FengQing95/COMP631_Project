Local Foods////My coworker and I split the roast beef and the truffle egg salad. They are now the top two sandwiches I've ever had in my life! The Asian coleslaw and kale salad were delicious. Just perfect. Fantastic balance of flavor and textures all around. I wish I could have found this place earlier and tried more of the menu. Can't wait to come back!
