Baby Barnaby's////When I went for a late breakfast Saturday around 11 this little restaurant was packed! After writing my name on the clip board that served as a waiting list, we got to enjoy a nice outdoor waiting area with self-serve coffee: Perfect pre-dining meeting area! Unforuntunatly the coffee thermos were empty, but we didn't even have to wait 10 minutes before we were seated by a fun and peppy waiter- who's name i wish i could remember, he was fantastic!- who served us hot coffee immediately!
