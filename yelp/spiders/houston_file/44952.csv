Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The place way the place is decorated gives it such a simple clean feeling and it is much appreciated since it just always feels so bright and welcoming when you walk in. The place is always packed so finding a place to sit can be hard at times. My only complaint is the parking... yes I know its Montrose but I just wish the parking lot could be bigger. I hate finding parking on the street since it always takes forever. If you are lucky to nap the spots in the parking lot then you are blessed. I cant wait to come back for my next delicious pastry!
