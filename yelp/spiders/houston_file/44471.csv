Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their menu changes every month because they use seasonal ingredients. Some items always stay such as the daily bread with butter and preserves. Common Bond has the best bread and croissants. The croissants are so flaky and the butter just melts in your mouth and not to mention they have the largest croissants I have ever seen. Â They also have a selection of little cakes that are very meticulously designed and you can see that the chef has paid attention in great detail. They sell macarons but I have yet to try one.
