Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After a less than satisfactory experience at the Medical Center store, I decided to give Common Bond another chance. About 3 weeks ago, I visited the Montrose location. My breakfast was very good; however, I was taken aback by having to stare at the "F" word written on the men's room wall above the urinal. I reported this to the manager, Ashley, and she contacted the corporate office. Before I left, she came by my table and said it would be cleaned up that week.
