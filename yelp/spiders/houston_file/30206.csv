The Pit Room////This is my second time visiting and first during the pandemic.  There wasn't a long line and minimal tables being that the restaurant is adhering to social distancing.  I got the 3 meat plate because I couldn't decide - the sausage had been out awhile, but still tasty- I didn't worry about bringing it back, but had the 3 meat plate - pork rib, brisket and beef sausage with elite, charro beans and pickled veggies.  You should check them out!
