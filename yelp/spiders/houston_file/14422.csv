JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my go to place for ramen I love it here! Staff is kind and responsive I've been to other locations like the Katy one and it's not as good as the midtown location. Th food is amazing every single time i come i feel at home because the food is comfort food to me. Love it and everyone seems to love it as well since there's usually lines to seat people. I'm vegan so it's hard to find good food for people like me but this place only has 2 veggie options and one vegan option but it is spectacular!!! I come about once every two weeks or once every week because I love it so much especially now that's it's getting chilly out can definitely say I will be in more often.
