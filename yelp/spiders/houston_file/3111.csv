JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Of course, parking is not going to be walk up, so unless you live/work in the area, expect to walk short distance. Food was good but not spectacular. Don't think it's intended to be, but noodles were tasty. Ambiance is pretty nice, but kind of rectangular, and seems a bit tight. Tables therefore a little small too. Cute little welcome they yell out for every customer arriving. Attentive friendly service.
