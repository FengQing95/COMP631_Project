Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Why wait in line if when you end up being served cold food not once time over, but twice. Pass. They picked the worse location. We call it ground zero in this area. Not safe. Also, the place is not clean. Bathroom user beware which make you feel servers dont wash their hands. Why waste anytime speaking of the food. Better chains elsewhere. Sadly this chain link just doesn't make the cut. Snooze is a Snooze. Sleep in, dont go.
