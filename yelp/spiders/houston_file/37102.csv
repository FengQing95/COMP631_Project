Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very original place.   It's a very fun experience.  There are many hand crafted drinks.  They have a rolling 3 course meal and it's typically the best.  Unfortunately they don't allow you to have an item on the special menu unless you do the full course and there's no substitutions.  Not the best customer service as you are screwed if you don't like something. There is a fancy whiskey room that you can book for parties.  The atmosphere is high ceilings and you have to sit at long tables with other people.
