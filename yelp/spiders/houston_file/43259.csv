Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////the quality of service has consistently been poor. i have been there over 5 times, mostly during the day, and the wifi has not once worked. I brought my therapy dog in with his identification, and the manager(i'm guessing new with the transition) made me feel so small and horrible for having him with me. Â She covered the pastries with her arms as if my dog would grab them. I almost had an anxiety episode from the scene she was causing. I was planning on sitting outside anyway, where they have dog friendly items and a sign saying dog friendly. Regardless, my dog is required to be welcomed with me. This manager made me consider never coming back. That truly is a shame.
