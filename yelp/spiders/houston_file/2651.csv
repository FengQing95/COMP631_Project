JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food is pretty yummy especially on a cold winter night. The price point is a little high for what you get but because of the location, I kind of expected this. Parking is a nightmare as always in Midtown, but I believe everyone should try this place if you're obsessed with Ramen, noodles, soup, or anything spicy! I believe it's one of those places that will be around for at most two years, so might as well try it before it turns into another restaurant!
