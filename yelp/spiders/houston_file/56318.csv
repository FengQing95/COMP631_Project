Kata Robata////Came on a Thursday night and the restaurant wasn't super busy or anything. Parking was a breeze. We were seated immediately since we had reservations. Service here was TRASH. Our waiter in all of his suspender wearing glory waited like.. 10-15? minutes after we were seated before appearing. I will deal with mediocre food but mediocre service? No.
