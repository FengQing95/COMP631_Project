Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat was welcoming and produced a great atmosphere. There was a wait but we were allowed to sit at the bar. The bar keeps were willing to answer any questions and ready to serve. Jackie was wonder and answered all questions and recommended the pork hush puppies along with the brick chicken. Both were good.
