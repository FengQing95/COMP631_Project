Kata Robata////Since it was my boyfriends birthday, they also gave us free dessert! He picked the green tea  soufflé which came with red bean ice cream. It was a great way to end the meal and was not too heavy at all. I also really liked the grounded Black sesame powder that the ice cream sat on top of! It added a nice texture and nuttiness to the desert.
