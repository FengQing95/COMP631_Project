JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen seems to be very polarizing: think pasta for Italians; red beans and rice or jambalaya for Louisianans. Everyone thinks what their mom/grandma made is the best/truest example and everything else is a poor imitation. You also have the idiots that think ramen is the shit they ate in college and complain about it being salty.
