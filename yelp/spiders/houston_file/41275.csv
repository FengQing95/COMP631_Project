Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I decided on the oyster poboy which was delish.  Served on a buttery brioche bun with aioli and homemade pickles. I however was a little turned off by the pickled okra.  Would have preferred pickled onions to give the zing.  The okra and tomatoes with the aioli made this poboy a bit sloppy.  I was a little miffed that they had these beautiful heirloom tomatoes but whom ever prepped it forgot to take the sticker off and it happened to be the slice on my sandwich. The redeeming part of this dish was the perfectly cooked oysters.  Crisp and properly drained of oil. I loathe overly greasy fried oysters.
