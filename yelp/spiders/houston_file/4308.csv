JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ken - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you felt our ramen wasn't good. For future reference, you can always ask that your ramen not contain any spicy sauce. We're never going to be all things to all people, but we do try our best to accommodate every palate and preference. Thanks again, and we hope you're willing to come back and try another ramen that might better suit your liking.
