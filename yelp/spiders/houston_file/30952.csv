The Pit Room////It was a first visit for our party of five as well. A good rule for a newbie is to try everything, which is exactly what we did with the Feast No. 2: a beef rib, 6 pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, turkey, chicken, the three sausages (venison, beef, jalape√±o and cheddar), and three sides (of green beans, elote, and mac and cheese, in our case). It's a pity the requested chicharrones fried in-house were forgotten when ordering, but I'll get it next time.
