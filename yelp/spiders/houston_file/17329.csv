Uchi////Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! This place deserves 5 stars! Staff is professional and knowledgeable. Ask them anything and they have an answer ready. I love going to a place that respects the food and delivers great customer service, consistently! This place is pricey but it is totally worth it. I am not a huge sushi lover but this place is #1 in my book. The way they pair foods with unlikely ingredients is creative, inspiring and refreshing. Every time I've been, we are always served a chilled quick bite before we even order. I LOVE places that do this. It shows that they care about their customers and they are there to entertain and provide above and beyond service for their guests. If you don't have a reservation, which are hard to come by, get there at 4:30pm. They open at 5pm. Grab a tea or coffee next door at Southside, which is always AWESOME, and wait until they open. Upon entering, the staff will be pacing out delicious bites before you are even seated. WOW, that's what I call above and beyond! it likes being welcomed to a friend's home. The specials menu is great. Its only from 5-6:30pm but it's perfect. Prices vary from $3-$12. Plenty to choice from if you're watching your budget. And the taste is NOT sacrificed due to pricing. It's equally amazing and fresh. My all time favorite are the Brussels sprouts. It's tangy and delicious! Once, I ordered two plates of them! The fish is SUPER FRESH. If you really, really like taking it up a notch; sit at the sushi bar. It's fantastic! Our server was Son. He's simply awesome! Fun, knowledgeable and consistent. He serves up anything you want, anyway you want it. I really love this place and highly recommend to any to try it. Make it special, reserve WELL IN ADVANCE and be prepared to have a good time. It definitely is one of the best restaurants in Houston.
