Uchi////One word, amazing! If you are looking for a special place to celebrate I HIGHLY recommend coming here. My fianc√© took me for my birthday even though he doesn't like sushi and he still found amazing and delicious items on the menu. Complimentary Valet and we even got a complimentary appetizer from the chef! Also, I ordered an item that was good but not something I loved and they took it off our bill and gave us a sample of one of their popular items that was to die for. So impressed and can't wait to go back.
