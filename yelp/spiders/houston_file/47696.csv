Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Pineapple Upside Down Pancake was sweet perfection.  Again, each individual ingredient was delicious by itself, and the combo was superb.  Their pancakes are the cake-y style that I love, not sponge-y at all.  The pineapple chunks were small size and generous throughout the pancake.  The crème anglaise was delicious perfection, and the cinnamon butter to spread was also perfection.  This pancake is the type of item that I would think about later and return to the restaurant to order it again.
