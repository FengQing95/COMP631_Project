JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////the food was AMAZING and i loved the community style seating. I had Jinya 2 with a seasoned egg. If you're even considering getting the egg DO IT. it was a weird grey color so I was skeptical but now I'm so glad I tried it. I would eat here every week if I could, it's so yum!
