Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food is pretty good, especially the croissant. Unfortunately, althought overstaffed, the place has serious management/flow issues. It can take up to 30 minutes to order a cup of coffre and another 20 to prepare it, especially if a couple undecided customers are "shopping" for cakes. At any given time, there are at least 3-4 waiters performing their jobs literally: " waiting, not doing anything."
