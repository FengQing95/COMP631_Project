Kata Robata////Am I missing anything??? I can not believe a place like this is being rated for 4 starts??? This is the second worst sushi place I have ever been to in Houston town!! I went there for dinner with my boyfriend in Houston Restaurant Week. We had been seeing ppl check-in to this restaurant for a few times. So we decided to give it a try. We made a reservation one day before and got there on time. Two hosts at the door with very rude attitudes asked us if we had a reservation. Then we were taken to a table while there r several booths available. I got rejected ruthlessly after I politely asked if we can get a booth since there were so many empty ones(one group was even leaving). I couldn't help but wondering if they were working unpaid. Then we ordered. I got three courses from the HRW menu and my boyfriend got something else from the regular menu. The only thing that tasted OK was the hamachi sashimi. It had lime/lemon juice on it so it was pretty freshing. Then other courses came, the only thing I can say is that the dry bitter Kobe beef and the fishy smell bone marrow were not even the worst part. My boyfriend ordered ramen, his favorite Japanese dish. It was brought on in two smaller bowls because our waiter splitted it for us to share. At first, we thought he was sweet and thoughtful, until our bill came and a $3 was charged for splitting the ramen, which we did not request. We started to feel a lil swindled so we asked our waiter why are we being charged without being inform of this pay service. And here comes the most amazing part. he shrugged his shoulders with a face and said to us: oh.... Ya ...I'm sorry. As if he couldn't do anything obout it. I wanted to argue but my boyfriend didn't want to waste time, so we left with only 15% tips. With all the unpleasant experience and the food quality I am def not coming back
