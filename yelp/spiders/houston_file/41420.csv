Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been here 5 or 6 times, and it is always a consistently great experience. Lines can be long, especially on the weekends but it moves fast. Pastries are amazing. I like the fruit tart, almond croissant, and oatmeal cream pie in particular. Brunch items also never disappoint. Reasonable prices in my opinion since the quality of the food is always on point.
