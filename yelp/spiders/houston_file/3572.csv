JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chris D. - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry to hear you were displeased with the ramen bowls you ordered. For future reference, please know that if you have any issue whatsoever with our food, just tell your server and they will be happy to send it back to the chefs to remake so it meets your satisfaction. Furthermore, we do not add MSG to our ramen; however, some of the ingredients that are used to prepare our broth, such as soy sauce, do contain MSG.
