JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved my visit to Jinya! We only had to wait about 15 minutes for 5 of us but that's because a big chunk of their seating is a long community table. We were very close to strangers which I'm okay with but if that's not your thing you should tell the hosts when you arrive!
