Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Favorite bakery in Houston thus far!  The morning bun is probably my favorite.  A lot of their pastries are not overly sweet and very moist.  I haven't tried much of their other food yet, but it all looks very delicious!  My go to bakery especially at night when the baked goods are 50% off!
