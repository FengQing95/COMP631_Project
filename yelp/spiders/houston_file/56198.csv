Kata Robata////Fantastic! First time visitor and will certainly be back. We ordered items from different sections of the menu to get a feel of their offering.  Of course, this was properly guided by our server who was on point with her knowledge of the menu.  Our fav dish on this visit was the akayushi beef skewers... so nice we did it twice!
