JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is amazing , full of life and city positive vibes The Â food is good and tasty, you can never go wrong with any of their menu choices . Wait time can be a challenge, usually varies between 15- 50 minutes during the evening time .I will always bring my company to dine here , and i think you should do too .
