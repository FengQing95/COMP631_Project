Local Foods////All in all, it's definitely an awesome restaurant where you want to try pretty much everything on the menu. I can't really think of any other places that have sides that are quite like these. I strongly suggest you come with friends and sample their food. Next time, I'm going to try their salads. They're probably healthier than the sandwiches. With dressing, they might not be. But... it's the thought that counts.
