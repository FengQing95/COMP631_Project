Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the natural squeeze oj, which was of course delicious and ordered the GREEN EGGS. The platter comes with the sausage, wheat toast and potatoes (scrumptious). I ordered mine with the veggie sausage, which was pretty delicious. The green eggs are filled with artichokes, spinach and cheese. They are actually very cheese, not complaining just informing.
