Uchi////I have had my eye on Uchi for quite a while, since it's at a very busy intersection.  I gaze longingly at it whenever I go to Velvet Taco, Mala Sichuan, or Sweetgreen.  Anyways, I finally took the plunge and went to Uchi during their weekday happy hour ("sake social") around 5 pm on a Tuesday.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Typically, the staff more or less ignore you if you're by yourself, but my waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations.  Then, they have an assigned sushi chef for each customer, which is super nice.  They also do a few cute things, like heated towels and a drink sampler.  I was initially planning on just getting a handful of rolls for $6 a piece and getting out of there, but the experience was so nice that I just ordered to my heart's content off the happy hour menu and regular menu until I was way too full.  Among the items I got included yokai berry, walu walu, spicy crunchy tuna, spicy sake maki, negi hama futomaki, nasu nigiri (x4), ikura with raw quail egg, and the peanut butter semifreddo.  I also tried some brussel sprouts from a friendly customer next to me at the sushi bar.  The food quality was amazing, and the presentation was fantastic.  In no way did I feel either rushed or ignored, even as the evening got busier; the pacing was perfect.  All in all, I spent $60 on food/tax/tip, which is a bit much for me for casual dining on a weekday, but would be reasonable for a special occasion.  In theory, I could just come here and order 3 rolls (the maki), and spend ~$20 or the same as a much more average sushi restaurant and leave feeling more satsified, but I'd feel a little cheap (plus I wouldn't be able to resist some of the other items).
