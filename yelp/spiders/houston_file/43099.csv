Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1. Nutella bread - 4/5 This is a pastry that is a biscuit on the outside and filled with nutella on the inside.  It also has a few crunchy chocolate beads on top.  It is my favorite one so far at Common Bond but I realized it's because I love nutella.  I did not think the pastry that holds the nutella is special at all.  It is neither crunchy nor moist nor perfectly baked.  However, the crunchy chocolate beads on top were incredible, and really made this my favorite pastry.
