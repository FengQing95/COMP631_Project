Local Foods////I am OBSESSED with this place. I mean... Their Truffled Egg Salad with market greens, parmesan and aioli on a pretzel bun is heavenly. The truffle is pretty strong, but not overpowering! It's probably the best egg salad sandwich I have ever had in my life AND unlike anything I have ever had. You can't find any other place that can make a sandwich like this! Their Posole soup is also really delicious! Flavorful but light, with a bit of a kick! Some of the things on their menu also change with the seasons, which I love since they are called LOCAL FOODS, and I think it is the best way to stay relevant.
