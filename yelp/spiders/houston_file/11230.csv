JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jonathan - Thanks for your review. We appreciate your feedback, and I regret that you had to wait so long for a table. We definitely have peak-service hours, and with hindsight being 20/20, if we could go back in time we would have built a restaurant three times in size. Back in 2014 when there were only a handful of ramen shops in Houston, we had no idea the demand for Japanese ramen would be so high. We were wrong. And as such, we have launched several more JINYA restaurants in the greater Houston area. Hopefully this will alleviate some of the crowds.
