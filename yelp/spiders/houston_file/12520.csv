JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Cha-Cha-Cha (Jinya #3) was a pleasant surprise addition to my meal that I fell in love with. I wasn't wild about the thick ramen noodles but the flavorful broth and tender pork made it all come together nicely. This is for sure a must-try for you and a will-do-again for me!
