JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Gerard - Thank you for your great review. I really appreciate your description of our house, and the fact that you "get" what our designers were going for by introducing this look and feel of a Japanese ramen shop transplanted in the heart of Houston, Texas. Not everyone is a fan of our layout, but it's always appreciated when folks give us props for it.
