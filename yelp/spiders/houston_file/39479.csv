Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to Bosscat for brunch with friends had heard about this place for a while heard good reviews. My two friends put in their orders before me and their food arrived before mine. My friend was about to cut into her sausage and I saw a long blonde hair hanging from her food. We called the waiter over and sent the food back.
