Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were visiting Houston and were told this was one of the best places for Brunch. They were definitely correct. The wait for was about 45 minutes at around 10:30am but we just went and walked around outside looking at the houses so it went fast. When we got sat, our waiter was very friendly and had no issue explaining stuff we did not know about. I had the pancake trio and it was beyond amazing. It was the perfect amount of sweet and savory! I highly recommend this eatery!
