JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Extremely good ramen! Better than Tiger's Den in Chinatown. I always get the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the pan fried pork gyozas. The ramen comes with plenty of chicken and noodles. The broth is delicious and you have a choice of 3 levels of spicyness. The restaurant itself is really nice with dim lights. Definely coming back again and again and again.
