Kata Robata////I've NEVER had anything I didn't want to eat again here. Their signature rolls are all really unique and delicious. You wouldn't think mango would be great in maki, but it's awesome. The items off of the robata menu are amazing. The foie gras and anything is awesome. Their sake list is impressive. The not so traditional things like lobster mac and cheese hit very high notes.
