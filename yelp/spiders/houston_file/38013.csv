Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Decent hipster whiskey bar with really good food that is overpriced for what you get (sandwich and fries is easily $20.)  My salad was okay but again, not worth the price.  Had these pork hush puppies for an appetizer and again , tasty, but you only get five for I think $10-11.  Just too much.  Ambiance and service were excellent.
