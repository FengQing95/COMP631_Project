The Pit Room////This is a very inside the loop place as far as pricing and atmosphere, especially during a weekday lunch where you will see mostly young professionals.   I ordered the two meat plate with brisket and pork sausage, and chose mac and cheese and charro beans as my sides.  Pretty much the only part I wasn't fond of was the runny mac and cheese.  It was nothing special.
