JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Suz, Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed the ramen, but am sorry your server accidentally put her thumb in your bowl -- there are no excuses for that. Unfortunately, these types of incidents happen occasionally, and when they do we try our best to remedy the situation immediately. Did you request another bowl? If not, please know for future reference that if, for any reason whatsoever you are unhappy with your food, we will happily re-make it for you as quickly as possible. We would essentially place your "re-make order" at the front of the queue regardless of how busy we are. Again, as a business owner, I cannot accept these types of mistakes as routine, though I am willing to offer some small amount of understanding for the fact that we are all human, and humans make mistakes. Also, thank you for pointing out the poor quality of the servers' "Irrashai" greetings. In this regard there is no excuse for our servers to not provide an energetic, lively greeting to show their enthusiasm and genki spirit. We do our best every day to provide excellent service, so when we miss the mark, I'm always grateful to folks like you who point out the shortcomings. Thank you again for your review and for visiting JINYA. We appreciate your patronage greatly.
