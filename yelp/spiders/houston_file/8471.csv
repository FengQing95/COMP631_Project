JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of my favorite places to eat Ramen in Houston. I always get the spicy chicken ramen. The server also recommended the black tonkatsu which he said was another crowd favorite. The ramen is a good portion size. You don't leave still hungry or too full. The broth was flavorful and the chicken was tender. The location is a little small so it may get cramped during peak hours and you end up sitting elbow to elbow with strangers. I personally don't mind it and find it nice since it makes it easier to start a conversation with others and possibly make some new friends. There's a garage right behind it so parking isn't so bad.
