Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They have both indoor and outdoor seating. There are large umbrellas and fans outdoors which allow for a nice breezy brunch experience, which we preferred. The indoor space is huge, and they even have rooms and a separate area for private events. They don't do any carafes for drink options, but they have a ton of drink options, all of which were delicious. We'll definitely be back!
