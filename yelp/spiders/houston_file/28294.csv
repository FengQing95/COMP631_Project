The Pit Room////Long line on a Friday night but it went really fast! Im very picky about my potato salad and their Mustard potato salad passed the test! I like a more mustard- based potato salad for sure, like their's! The jalapeno cheese pork sausage sandwich was amazing. Cole slaw was very vinegar-y, just like I like! Great atmosphere, Â good music outside, and the Astros game on. Couldn't get better!!
