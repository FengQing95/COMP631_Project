JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI Joyce - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you did not love our ramen. We're never going to be all things to all people, but if you're ever served a dish that does not meet your satisfaction 100%, just inform your server and he or she will suggest an alternative. Or perhaps remake the bowl in the event the chef made a mistake.
