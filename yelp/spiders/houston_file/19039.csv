Uchi////The first time we arrived, we had a reservation for three the Sunday night before President's day.  Like all the other reviews mentioned, there was a wait even with a reservation.  But it wasn't painfully long, and the bar staff definitely made up for it by keeping our (complimentary) proseccos full.
