Kata Robata////This place was just ok. There are places way better than kata in Houston. The lobster Mac and cheese was good. Rising sun roll was especially weak, too much truffle oil. And honestly it could have done without it. The gyoza was plain, have had better. Tofu mushroom salad was ok, tofu was undercooked. Hostesses were terrible. Saw lots of open tables (just two of us) where we could have been sat. Instead they were just left open for 20+ minutes while we and other guests waited. Then they proceeded to sit us behind a rather large and noisy table. They were so incredibly loud they basically ruined our dinner. Our server was the only person to apologize (even though he wasn't the one that needed to) and no manager ever stopped by to see how our dining experience was.
