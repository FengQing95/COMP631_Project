Kata Robata////This, by far, was my favorite meal while working in Houston for two weeks! I tried many restaurants. Some were good, others left much to be desired. The sushi at Kata Robata was great! We ordered three sushi rolls: longhorn (fried shrimp, eel, avocado, spicy mayo), salmon and soft shell crab, and caribbean (fried lobster, spicy tuna, mango, avocado). All were great, but the longhorn and Caribbean were my favorites! We ordered the miso lobster mac, also. While it was tasty (the miso was subtle), I've enjoyed tastier lobster mac at several other restaurants. I think it lacked a little flavor. Maybe the use of sharper cheeses (robusto Gouda, sharp aged white cheddar) would've done the job. And I'm not really one to wish for much salt in my dishes, but a little salt would have gone a long way here. Even still, the mac was a solid 3.5 and the sushi rolls were a good 4.5. Whenever I'm ever in the Houston area, I will be sure to return!
