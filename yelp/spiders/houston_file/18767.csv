Uchi////I just want to heap praise on the employees here for a minute. I went to Uchi last week for what was supposed to be a date. After waiting at the bar for some time I realized my date wasn't going to show up and I decided to go home. When I told the hostess what happened and asked to take my name off the list, she immediately went and talked to the manager and had my meal paid for. I wish I had gotten her name but if anyone sees this I'd just like to thank her, the manager and the bar staff again for completely turning my bad day around. You all are so sweet and the food was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back soon!
