JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great place to eat with a great atmosphere. My favorite is the pork Chashu bowl and I don't remember the name of the ramen I tried but I don remember it being very delicious. It's a small dining area so be wary of the time of day you're going. I went on a Wednesday at around 11a/12p and it was very crowded. The servers are super nice and very attentive.
