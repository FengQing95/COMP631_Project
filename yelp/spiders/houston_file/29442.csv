The Pit Room////The best BBQ I've ever had. You order your food cafeteria style but they've got a huge variety and rotational sides (I had the okra, but another option was a tomato/cucumber salad). The staff is super friendly and one old guy noticed I had forgotten to grab silverware by the register as I was filling up my drink (citrus infused green tea) and said, "you ain't got nothin' to fight with son!" as he handed me some utensils. As we sat down to eat Merle Haggard started playing on the radio. Goddamn I love Texas (and this restaurant).
