Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very friendly waiter with the beard! Food was on point, very hot and delicious. Pig Candy was awesome!!! I would describe this place as upscale pub with great service, restroom doorman, attentive staff, superb drinks and food. My group and I would definitely come back for a relaxing evening.
