Local Foods////Although this dish is far and away the shining star, there's so much to love about this place. It's fresh, local (surprise surprise), and makes you feel light and healthy afterwards, as opposed to feeling like you swallowed an acme anvil for lunch. Vegetarians, Local Foods has got your name written all over it! Although it's perfectly suited for meat eaters as well.
