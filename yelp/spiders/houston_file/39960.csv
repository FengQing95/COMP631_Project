Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went to Saturday brunch here, and it was great overall. The mimosas were good (good ratio of bubbly and juice), and the bloody Mary's were solid. We had a totchos was an appetizer, and they were delicious! I could have had them as a whole meal. I had the gluten-free pancakes, and they were some of the best I've ever had. Eggs and bacon were good but not special. The waiter was fine, and we had generally good service.
