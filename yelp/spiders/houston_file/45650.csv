Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Seeing the line of desserts they offered, I had to come back. And I was not let down. I got the mocha chocolate cake and there were like 5 different layers of chocolate. All I know is that the ganache was on top and the bottom layer was some hard chocolate but it was a good classic dessert.
