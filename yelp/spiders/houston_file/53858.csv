Kata Robata////We went last night for a Chef's Tasting dinner.  It was absolutely outstanding - fantastic way to try different things that I normally wouldn't order.  I don't typically like sea urchin or abalone but the way it was prepared was delish!  The service was also outstanding - Ty was an amazing server.  He gave us excellent descriptions of each plate and we never waited long for anything.
