Uchi////-Fried Milk ($9): holy crap. my fav part of the meal!!! the soft delicious pillows of nitrogen frozen milk deepfried and dipped into the soft fluffy foamy sherbet --- wow! topped with crunchy cornflakes - didn't know i could experience so many different textures in one dish at the same time. Â hands down MUST try for the experience alone! the chocolate part wasn't my fav because it was kind of bitter, but i guess it complemented the sweeter parts well. SO RECOMMENDED!
