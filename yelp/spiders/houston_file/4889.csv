JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We also ordered the green tea mochi ice cream for dessert... Yeah, never again. Those little balls were unimpressive. Had we just eaten the ramen we would have left relatively pleased. The mochi just killed the dining experience for us but luckily this was well after I had enjoyed my ramen assari.
