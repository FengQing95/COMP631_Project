Kata Robata////Love their sushi!   My fav is their foie gras sushi.  Their happy hour menu is the best! A few of our fav things are the longhorn roll, foie gras sushi, foie gras & scallop sushi, uni, otoro, Miso Crusted Bone Marrow , slow-cooked pork belly with a 68 degree poached egg, sauteed spinach ( which has been taken off the menu), Miso Lobster Macaroni & Cheese , lychee martini, hamachi collar, Uni Chawanmushi,Spicy Soy Ramen (split into 2, they add an extra egg & pork belly in two sep. bowls for additional $4),Yuzu Marinated Salmon Sashimi,Kata's Fresh Catch Mixed Ceviche,Hamachi & Jalapeño Sashimi,KOBE BEEF TACOS (only available during happy hour).  I miss their foie gras & scallop app.
