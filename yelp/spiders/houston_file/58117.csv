Kata Robata////We first started with the Nigiri (yellowtail, Toro, Salmon, Shrimp, and scallops). And let me preface this review by saying that I'm traditionally a cooked sushi girl but this Nigiri was amazing. The fish was so fresh and literally melted in your mouth. The rice was cooked to perfection and not a hint of sogginess in the rice! 5/5
