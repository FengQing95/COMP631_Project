Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes - I just gave it 5 Stars. By far the best food I've had in houston. Not just the sweets but the actual food. Best breakfast!! Can't wait to try lunch and dinner. If I could afford to eat here everyday - I would! My husband had chicken/gravy...nothing like it. I had steak and grits... omg. It was a true experience. If you're a foodie - go!!!
