Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We ordered our pastries and coffee, got lucky and found a table, and proceeded to wait for 15 minutes for two lattes. They seemed extremely overwhelmed by all the coffee orders, like it's some surprise that people want a coffee with their breakfast. When they finally arrived (we had already eaten most of the pastries) they were delicious and had a cute fancy design on the top.
