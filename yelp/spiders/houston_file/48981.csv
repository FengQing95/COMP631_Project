Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Popped in for a late breakfast during my first visit to Houston. Amazing! The wait wasn't bad, about twenty minutes for me. I had a hot chocolate, hash browns, bacon, and the pancakes flight. The plain and sweet potato pancakes were killer. And the hot chocolate was the best I've ever had. Oh, and my server was awesome. Will definitely be back.
