JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Please know that we have suffered in the past by guests who tell us their dinner companions are "just coming up the sidewalk" or "just parking the car," only to create a massive-seating backlog. Also, there have been many occasions when our restaurant has gone from nearly empty to completely full in less than 15 minutes. So while there is no perfect solution to seating guests, we should handle most situations on a case-by-case basis. I appreciate your taking the time to bring this to my attention, and I am also grateful to you for your kind words regarding our food.
