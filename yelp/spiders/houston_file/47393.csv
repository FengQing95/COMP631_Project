Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let's just start off with saying the food here is absolutely delicious.Their breakfast tacos are flavorful and filling, would definitely recommend. We came here during the week around 1PM and there was almost no wait; however, I tried to go once on a weekend and was told the wait would be over an hour and a half so I left. The only thing was the service. Our waitress would go missing for significant periods of time and never checked on us outside of taking our order, thus the 1-star dock. Overall would definitely recommend this place!
