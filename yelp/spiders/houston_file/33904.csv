Local Foods////Sides are terrible.  Pretzel bread is served on just about every sandwich to mask the ingredients.  I like a good salad but I feel like an employee stopped by a vacant lot on the way to work and picked a bunch of weeds for the spring harvest salad.  I've had beef jerky more tender than the weeds in that salad.
