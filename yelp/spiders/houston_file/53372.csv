Kata Robata////Thinking it's "great" restaurant, I chose to celebrate my husband's birthday here. I made reservations and told the hostess it's a birthday dinner. We get there and they didn't have a table for us. Ok. So we waited... not long, maybe 5 minutes. The hostess proceeds to seat us at a two-top table in a very open area of the restaurant. Normally I wouldn't care but I felt I made an effort to make reservation (a birthday one, too) and the least they could do was reserve us a more private table. Major disappointment there. Good thing my husband is laid back and he didn't care. Another major disappointment, the waitstaff never acknowledged the special occasion, just treated us as if we were there for regular dinner.
