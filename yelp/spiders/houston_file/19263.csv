Uchi////I made a reservation for my mom's birthday. At the time of the reservation I called to let them know I'd be 10 minutes late as there was some traffic on westheimer. As I was pulling up to he valet they called me back and said it would be another 1.5 hours to sit at a 'community table'. So basically they gave my table away even though I had the courtesy to call and let them know I was a few minutes late. Horrible service in my opinion. I've been here a few times and the food is good but I have had better sushi elsewhere for much less. I don't need to be treated like that, this place isn't as special as the reviews would lead you to believe. The pretentiousness is absurd. I doubt I'll go back. Most importantly it's a shame because my mom wanted to celebrate her birthday there and was really disappointed. We ended up at Kata Robata because we were snubbed and I think it worked out for the best as Kata is much more friendly and the food is much much better.
