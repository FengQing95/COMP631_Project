JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had a problem with Jinya and I was contacted by their owner about it not to remove the review, not even to defend themselves or bash me, but to genuinely tell me that they read my complaint and wanted to fix it. I value service way more than quality of food to be honest, and this is definitely a place that values their service and I appreciate that. I've actually never had bad service here, even on the night that I didn't have the most positive experience. I will be back sometime in the future to give this place another shot, as they do value their customers' experience and see if I can finally find THE RAMEN.
