Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really enjoy going to get breakfast at Snooze. I usually go to the location in the woodlands since it is closer to where I live. But a couple of my friends and I went to this location in Montrose and really enjoyed ourselves. We used the wait list through yelp so by the time we got there our table was ready. I ordered the snooze classic and substituted my toast for the sweet potato pancake (best decision ever btw). Great customer service as well!
