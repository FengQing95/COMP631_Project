Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The key to Snooze is going early, putting your name and number down, and hanging out in the neighborhood for the next hour. Sure, it may not be your "ideal" brunch plans but they'll text you and you won't have to wait outside for an hour (+). The food is incredible; I haven't eaten anything I don't like there!! They're also super accommodating to your group size. The only thing I'd change is their drinks--they sound and look SO GOOD but they're not really worth the price IMO. Perhaps I just haven't found the right one...
