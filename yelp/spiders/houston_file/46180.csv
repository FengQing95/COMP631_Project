Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The Brussel sprouts are amazing. Hands down. The best we've ever had!!! Go there now and order them!! Topped with Honey balsamic glaze with caramelized onion (we left the pancetta off), these were fresh and so delicious! The Poutine fries are really good, as is the French onion soup. We also ordered a vanilla latte with Oat Milk, and it was smooth, refreshing and perfect. The walnut chocolate chip cookie was decent, but probably wouldn't order that again. Overall, it's definitely worth the trip. The fresh baked breads looked great also.
