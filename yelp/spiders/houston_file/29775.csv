The Pit Room////The food was incredible. I'm only giving 4 stars because the line wasn't very long but it took a long time for them to move people through the line. The bbq is on the spicier side rather than sweet but it was great. The sauce is amazing. Wish they had Texas toast as opposed to plain white bread slices. The brisket was tender and cooked perfectly though! And that's what matters.
