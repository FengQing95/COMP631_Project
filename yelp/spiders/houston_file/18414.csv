Uchi////My boyfriend and I ordered the Omakase for like 10 dishes I believe (but we ended up making it like a 17 course meal i think). That night the price was 200 for two people. We did this because we wanted to try as many of the items as possible and we don't like to sit and wait and bask in the ambiance...we came to EAT the ADVENTURE like true fatties. We were there in time for happy hour so we ordered the pork belly...I would come back for that pork belly. Man I should have ordered more...
