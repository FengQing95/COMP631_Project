Local Foods////For those who are skeptical because of the price point, remember that these are ingredients that are fresh. Plus duck meat is pretty expensive from what I've seen. While you may be satisfied with a $5 foot long from Subway, you can tell that the vegetables are seriously not as "fresh" as they claim it to be (i.e. the leaves being very sad and kind of wilted but still somewhat green so, I mean, good enough). The taste of the sandwich was so crisp and not packaged-329048194527435435-miles-away-driven-to-store-and-kind-of-wilted tasting and I have to say that I think it's enough to make the sandwich taste 500x better. So just give it a try!
