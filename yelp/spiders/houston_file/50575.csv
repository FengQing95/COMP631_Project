Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the blueberry danish pancakes, OMG French toast, and another pancake that was topped with bacon. The blueberry danish pancakes were delicious with a cream cheese filling, blueberry topping, and the other pancake tied into that with its flavor in the cinnamon. The French toast was cooked well, with fresh strawberries and coconut topping. I really enjoyed the way that everything I had was tied together for a wonderful breakfast.
