Kata Robata////After frequenting the same sushi spots, I was ready to try something new. Kata Robata was our choice for Saturday night dinner (6pm), and I think we have a new favorite spot! The interiors are nicely done, the atmosphere was casual and family-friendly. We were seated immediately and enjoyed the last 30 minutes of happy hour with 1/2 priced Asahi, salmon carpaccio, salmon + soft shell crab roll and tempura veggies. We also had a 10 piece sampler and simple tuna roll. It was just enough food, and it tasted very fresh. For dessert I had their special: chocolate mousse with marshmallow ice cream and hazelnut crumble. Service was very attentive and was able to answer all of our questions.
