Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I first heard about this place, I thought "okay it's just another pastry shop... what's so fab about a croissant?" Um, put my foot in my mouth. Probably the best croissant I ever had. I love my bread with a crunch and their croissant stays crunchy! This place is the first that I have ever had a kouign amann and it's to die for... both figuratively and literally. It's all butter and sugar so say goodbye to your diet! I am picky about my macarons and only like 2-3 places in Houston. Try their PB&J macaron. So delish! Hubby and I picked up desserts for a friend and we were starving so we picked up some French bread. Thought we were only going to have a bite, but we ended up eating the entire loaf (and gave a few crumbs to the kids). Probably one of the best French loaves ever.
