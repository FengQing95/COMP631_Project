Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Absolutely amazing! This place has some of the best most delectable pastries. Everything was fresh, warm, and baked to perfection. This place is pretty small with not much parking so I recommend only coming in small groups. The kouign amann is a must have if it is your first time here.
