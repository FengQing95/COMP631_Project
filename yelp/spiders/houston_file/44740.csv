Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A friend and I decided to check this place out one Sunday morning as we'd spent weeks driving past it on the way to the grocery store.  The set up is very open and once walking in your immediately get in line to order.  During the ordering process, you first go through the drinks/pastries area to see what they have and then order off the menu once you get to the register.  The service was incredibly fast and the food came out quick.  The difficulty with this place, however, is that there is limited seating for the amount of people that are there on the weekends.  We were lucky to get a seat at the bar which ended up working out fine!
