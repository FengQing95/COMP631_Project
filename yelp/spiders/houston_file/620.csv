JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston//// The rest of us all got tonkatsu black and there was again definitely some quality concerns. Of the 4 only 2 I would say were good. 1 came out warm. Almost like it was sitting on a counter for far too long. Idk what happened with the other tonkatsu black, but the soup was definitely more red than the other 3. Like the red implied the soup was unusually spicy. My friend doesn't have a high spice tolerance so he really couldn't enjoy it. To make matters worse 3 of the 5 of us complained the next day about a bad stomach ache. Maybe mild food poisoning?
