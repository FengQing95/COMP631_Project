The Pit Room////New to Texas and have been searching for a great BBQ spot that could rival that of my husbands backyard smoker! This place is definitely a contender. We had the brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and two meat dinner with macaroni and cheese. Everything had great flavor already, but add the barbecue sauce and you find yourself wishing you ordered more! We will definitely put this place on our list to return too.
