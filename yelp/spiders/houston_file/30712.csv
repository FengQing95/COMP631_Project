The Pit Room////There are sooooo many BBQ places to try in Houston. But, a friend suggested The Pit Room as one of her faves. Wow wow wow!! This is the best BBQ I have ever had (except for family's BBQ)!! Seriously! Look at the bark and that smoke ring! Everything I ate was delicious! I had (pictured) the 2 meat dinner (2 meats, 2 sides, BBQ sauce on the side and a slice of white bread): mustard potato salad, mac-n-cheese, brisket and venison sausage. The brisket is phenomenal, and that venison sausage thoooooo!!! The line is long, but definitely worth the wait.
