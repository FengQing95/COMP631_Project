Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Burger came out looking perfect. First bite exposed the freezing cold lettuce and tomato - odd experience. The meat was cooked to the correct temp but the burger as a whole was lukewarm at best. The cheese couldn't melt under the bipolar conditions. Bun looked beautiful but really just dusty and stale/crumbly. Very happy I didn't go with the on-menu "off-menu" option which called for balsamic vinegar or something to that effect.
