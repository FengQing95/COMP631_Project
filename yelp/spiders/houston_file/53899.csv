Kata Robata////I tried the ramen (might be the best in Houston) and the tropical spicy tuna rolls. It was an excellent combination of tuna and mango (I think). Whatever it was, it tasted great. The quality of the tuna wasn't the best in Houston but still definitely worth a try. The reason for only four stars is because of the service. They didnt give us happy hour prices even though we ordered a half hour before it ended, but we left afterwards. The parking situation really sucks too, you probably wont have any option but to use valet parking because the only open spots in that parking lot are reserved. My car ended up in the closest spot to the door, but it took about 15 minutes for them to just pull out of the parking spot because there was a line in front of us. I was literally standing in front of my car with keys but they are required to pull the car out of the spot...?
