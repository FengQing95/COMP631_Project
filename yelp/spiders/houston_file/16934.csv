JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Vegan Rice Bowl was also really nice, with a good mixture of textures. I really enjoyed the texture of the chickpeas as they were crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. The only thing I would like is for there to be some more sauce to add moisture to the dish. Overall 7/10
