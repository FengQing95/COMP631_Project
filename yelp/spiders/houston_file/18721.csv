Uchi////I was much fuller this time around than last time. What I take from this trip is that the cheaper stuff (the rolls, Avo Bake, Brussels Sprouts, Brie Ringo) has more substance, and will fill you up better. The other items are for taste. Another thing that hits me for value is the $3 (happy hour) sake that I keep gravitating to, as opposed to the obscenely-priced bottles of wine I would tend to get at other high-end joints.
