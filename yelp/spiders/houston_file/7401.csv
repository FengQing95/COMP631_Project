JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far my absolute favorite ramen spot in Houston! I was a bit hesitant to try it out after learning that it was a chain, but I was so pleasantly surprised to say the least. The menu boasts a large selection of different ramen options and having tried many of them, I can say they're all pretty great. Extra pork chasu is a must!!
