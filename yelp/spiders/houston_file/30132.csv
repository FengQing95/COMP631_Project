The Pit Room////I want to start off by saying that the food wasn't horrible but I was certainly underwhelmed. I got the two meat dinner with mac and cheese, and loaded elote. It's not their fault, but it was hard to understand or hear the guys taking my order-plexiglass everywhere! He was kind of rude, wasn't welcoming, and seemed to be bothered when I asked a question. The portions are meh. For a $18 plate they could've put more brisket and/or chicken on the plate! The mac and cheese was runny and tasted like velveeta. The elote was actually good! I'm Mexican so I know Street corn and I've never had it with cilantro, ever. The brisket and chicken was delicious! Cooked expertly and peppered precisely. Presentation was cute but I was just not having it. My partner had potato salad and it didn't have any flavor to me, maybe more mayo and mustard?
