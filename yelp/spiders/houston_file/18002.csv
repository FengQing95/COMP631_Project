Uchi////Had a variety of their hot and cool tasting and they are all amaze balls. Always get edamame here because it has a char to it. The uchiviche is my favorite item. Decent sushi, def overpriced, was not the best sushi I have had or anything but they tell you that sushi is not their speciality.Loved the fried milk, def a must. Also if you go during their happy hour (5-6:30) the sake social menu has great deals on food and drinks, loved the kara kyuri.
