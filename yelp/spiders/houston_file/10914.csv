JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Little background, I don't eat pork or beef. It was nice finding a place that used chicken broth. It was very flavorful. When you go, you have to get a seasoned egg in your ramen! Another nice aspect is that they give fresh garlic and a presser where you crush the garlic straight into your bowl. As an appetizer, we got the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, which was on a bed of spring mix. REALLY GOOD.
