Uchi////we had 4 different pork dishes, The best one is only serve during happy hr which is a pork on a skewer I forget what its called we just ordered one of everything on the happy hr menu so we didn't pay any attention. all the pork dishes had a great pork flavor to it and none of the pork was dry or over seasoned. 10
