Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been to this place a couple of times and it has always been very delicious. This was especially true when I recently visited. As per usual I had a difficult time picking just one dessert and then I saw their valentine's specialty dessert! It was absolutely delicious!! It is a chocolate mousse with a crumb cookie on the bottom covered with a delicious strawberry jelly on top! Â Also when you run out of jelly layer on top theres a fun surprise inside consisting of more delicious jelly in the middle!!
