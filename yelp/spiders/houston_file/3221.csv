JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The pork ramen broth was perfectly salty, but lacked complexity. Noodles lacked bounce but were not too under or overcooked. Great beer and sake selection, but the waitress could not explain the selections. This place has potential. Host staff perfectly friendly and created a comfortable atmosphere during a busy night.
