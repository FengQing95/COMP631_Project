Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Occasionally, I believe in self indulgence, especially during a pandemic. This means treating myself to a chocolate nutella croissant and an almond croissant! The bakery goodies never fail to disappoint at Common Bond. However, sometimes the customer services can lag, which is disappointing. It's more of an attitude, which they should cultivate more to better welcome customers. Perhaps, it's a millennial too cool for school attitude with the guy behind the goods... this can come off pretentious and annoying. Otherwise, the food does not disappoint. And for the most part, customer service is good. I may have had an off day. Otherwise, the food is always tasty. Unfortunately, I may have had an off date.
