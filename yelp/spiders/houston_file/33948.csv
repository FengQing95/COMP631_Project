Local Foods////I am loving Local Foods!   Surprisingly this is not my first time here, but this is my first time appreciating their food since I've switched to a plant base diet.  This is by far my best vegan restaurant.  I give this a five star for all this place has to offer- their great food, very reasonable prices, ambience and not to forget Their very generous portions!  I had the Garden Sammie sandwich made of  brussels sprouts, avocado, hummus, oven dried tomato, sprouts, pickled onions, ciabatta- This is a Veggie Sandwich made in Heaven!!!  I paired this with a side of their vegan chili soup - which was  a perfect match!    I got to try my hubby's order of vegan taco salad which was huge in portion and was very very good!   Of course, we had to order an extra side of their house potato chips which was just as good as it gets!  I envision myself coming back here again and again.
