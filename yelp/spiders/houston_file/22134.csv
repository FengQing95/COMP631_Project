Uchi////I went to the one in Dallas with some great friends. It was my first time trying sashimi and OMG! Am i glad I tried it there. It was delicious!! We had the chefs menu. Where you get to try different dishes recommended by the chef and everything that we had was top notch. We had the pleasure to meet the chef and owner that day and he was super nice! Im planing to go to the one here in Houston pretty soon . Can't wait to have fried milk again!!! Â it was a bit pricey but it was worth every penny...that's for sure!!
