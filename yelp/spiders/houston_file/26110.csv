The Pit Room////In that Killen's is actually in Pearland, this or Gatlin's is the best in the city limits. Bram hits home runs with his brisket, plate rib, venison sausage, and his sides are always on point. The old school sour cherry pie is great and the sweet tea and lemonade are always spot on. The in-house pickling of carrots, onions, jalapeno, and cucumbers is a nice addition as well. The tortillas made from rendered brisket fat are a piece of heaven. Bram even gets upgraded white bread for those who love their BBQ in a slice of white bread as I do.
