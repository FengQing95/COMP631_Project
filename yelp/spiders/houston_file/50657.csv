Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you're ready to brave the long wait, Snooze is a solid brunch spot in Houston. On the weekends, you'll have to wait at least an hour during peak times. Not so sure about the weekdays, but they do serve brunch 7 days a week! You can always walk over to Mercantile Montrose to get some great coffee while you wait (shameless plug for my favorite study spot). Parking sucks since there's only a tiny lot for the huge amount of patrons, but you can usually get street parking nearby. Â
