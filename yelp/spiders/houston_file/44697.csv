Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just wow! This place is pastry heaven!  I have visited a number of times and each was a great experience.  On the weekends, there is usually a short line but I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes.  I like to order one of the brunch options along with a pastry (I usually can't finish it all).  My favorite is the Kouign Amann which is basically a croissant layered with butter and sugar that is baked in a muffin tin.  Amazing!  They also offer a walnut chocolate chip cookie which is to die for!  This is my favorite bakery in Houston and will continue returning.  I'm excited for their location in the Heights to open up!
