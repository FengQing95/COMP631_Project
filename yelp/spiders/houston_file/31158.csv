Local Foods////IMO, the drive and price was worth it. I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich with kale and potato salad. Like almost all the the reviewers have said, the chicken sandwich is so goooooood. Chicken was moist and the pretzel bun was the best part for me. The bun was slightly sweet, but it completed the sandwich. I'd say I have a pretty average appetite for a college girl, and I was already full after half a sandwich. Potato salad was alright, nothing super amazing to say about it. You can't really go wrong with potato salad, can you? And order the kale! Delicious.
