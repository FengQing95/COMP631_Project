Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries and breakfast entrees are simply amazing! The best I've had in Houston. Â The parking is very limited, the bakery itself is very small, so finding a spot to sit (or even move) is difficult. The line is always long, but rightfully so, everything is delicious.
