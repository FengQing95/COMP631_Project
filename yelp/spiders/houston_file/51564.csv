Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////While vacationing in Houston, TX we came here for brunch. This brunch was AMAZING! The mimosas were to die for. I've experienced many brunch's in my lifetime, but not one quite like this regarding Snooze's Mimosa's. They're huge with a great amount of Champagne in them. Talk about one nice/"lit" brunch. I loved every bit of it and the food....Omg! The Banana and Pineapple pancake we had was to DIE for. I've never tasted anything like it. Our server was great and so kind also. I'd highly recommend this place.
