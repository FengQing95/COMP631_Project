Local Foods////Suffice it to say, this sandwich is pretty freaking awesome. The chicken is always fresh and soft, and the crushed chips and nut seed crumble offer just the right crunch. It's become my go-to order here, so much so that I don't feel a need to try anything else on their menu. I've tried the chips, fresh fruit (which they switch up seasonally), and beet salad as sides so far. I'd recommend them all, though the chips have a certain bitterness I don't always care for.
