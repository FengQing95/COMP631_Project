Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I didn't see any highchairs, so I'm not sure this place is baby friendly. I did see a table with a pre-school age child. The space is very bright and open, ample seating, but prob not enough for the crowds. Parking lot is an average size, but street parking is nearby also.
