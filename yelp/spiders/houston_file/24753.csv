Uchi////Made a reservation at open table. No long lines on this rainy day.  We sat in a booth.  Let's eat some creations. Ice cream candy bar was amazing because there's black sesame. Skip the brussel sprouts, very disappointing. Anything with Foie gras is amazing. Sashimi is so fresh and the presentation is everything.  Pork belly was the highlight. We got treated a dessert, the one with blueberry. Amazing.this restaurant is so dark because you have to use your senses to taste. We had to use the flashlight of our cell phone to read the menu. The menu is so extensive.  We ordered everything on the social sake (hint: happy hour menu).
