Baby Barnaby's////We were in Houston for the weekend and walked here for breakfast on the Sunday...DELICIOUS! Quite the wait (we arrived at 1130...very busy time), but well worth it. Great coffee, fresh OJ, and a few healthy options that made it easy to find the perfect balance of Sunday morning splurge. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely hit them up next time we are in town.
