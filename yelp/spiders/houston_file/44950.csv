Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love common bond. I rememember trying their vanilla latte and it was super good. I also had a couple of their sweet treats which were all amazing as well. I need to go back and try their food. Ive seen one of their sandwiches and it looks so delicious. Guess I know what I am having next time!
