Kata Robata////In total, I thought that all my menu items tasted perfect. The food here is extremely fresh and I can see why this restaurant has won so many Houston food awards. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are a fan of Japanese food. I don't normally like Japanese fusion, but the food here was too good to pass up!
