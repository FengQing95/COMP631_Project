Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good food, good atmosphere but not so good service. Our waiter was very inattentive as she was attending to her larger party seated next to us. My boyfriend is a restaurant manager so he had more understanding regarding the lack of attention we received, expressing that he could tell that it wasn't that she simply did not care but just wasn't a good waitress due to her failure to balance her tables. We definitely anticipated staying longer and having more drinks as we were drawn in being whiskey lovers; however, the time that it took to take our drink orders, take our food orders, and even deliver our check after our meals were promptly bagged made us want to leave as there was no experience. While food is a huge component for us, service means so much more - no matter how good the food is, if the service is not, we will not return. Fortunately, she still received a 20% tip completely as a result of him having more compassion and hoping to motivate her to perform better in the future; however, the only way we would return is if we were invited by others, not initiated by us as was the case today. It's really unfortunate because we were recommended by a friend and have frequented other surrounding restaurants. We expected a lot more and unfortunately, were not given that.
