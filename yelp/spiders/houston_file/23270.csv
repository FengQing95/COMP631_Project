Uchi////My favorite Japanese restaurant in Houston, easy parking and great atmosphere. Make sure you have reservations if you don't want to wait. And if you walk in and wait they will provide you snacks while you wait which Is very customer oriented. Zero Sen, short ribs, hamachi nabe and fried milk is must try.
