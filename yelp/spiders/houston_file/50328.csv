Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went early throughout the week. If I judge this place solely by this one visit, I don't think it is worth the hour + wait on the weekends. Granted, im sure the long wait is also due to the fact they serve alcohol...my favorite. Would I go back? Yes, I would. There were other items on the menu I wanted to try and I am always up for giving a place another shot. I would have to go throughout the week when I can just waltz in and sit down without waiting.
