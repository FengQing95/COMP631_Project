JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nick - Thank you for the great review. We're always happy to see young kids eating our ramen. It means a new generation of diners are getting exposed to a cuisine that didn't really exist in our fair city just a few years ago in the way that it does today. We appreciate your supremely kind words, and we hope you'll visit us again in the near future.
