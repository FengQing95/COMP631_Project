Local Foods////I suggested this place to my friend who is vegetarian and he really enjoyed this place and the selection it provided as well! I think the fresh ingredients and service are always a plus. But their home made hot sauce? I think that's what truly won me over lol. I wish they sold them by the bottle because it tastes like a spicier, more garlicky Sriracha without the sweet tang.
