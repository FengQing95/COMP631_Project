Uchi////After waiting forty minutes, yes forty minutes even with a reservation we eventually made it over to the table. The restaurant was popping, granted that quickly subsisted due to the fact that most of the people who were standing were also waiting customers. We decided on this occasion to opt for the: 6 course tasting menu, the 5 nigiri piece, the Brussels sprouts, 2 miso soups, 1 order of edamame and a bottle Albari√±o. This was all $215 and three people are comfortably. As per usual the food was DELICIOUS which made the wait somewhat bearable.
