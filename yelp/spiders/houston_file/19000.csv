Uchi////The food was great. We were beginning to think the wait was worth it for what we had so far. The Uchi Salad was simple yet different and amazing all at once. Our sour moods were perking up....then the night went downhill again. After all of our cold dishes (machi cure, uchi salad, crunchy spicy tuna roll) had been served, we waited another 30 minutes for the Jar Jar Duck and Pork Belly Tataki to come! Â
