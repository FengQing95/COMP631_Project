Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Incredibly slow. Waited 45 minutes for a table at 10:15. Then waited one hour for food. One. Whole. Hour. Did not refill water or offer to bring more coffee in that hour. Food was good, but really lousy service. Waiter was friendly, but a kitchen that takes an hour to prepare egg dishes is indicative of management that doesn't care about customers.
