Local Foods////Since the place is new, it's not super busy yet. It's been nice to go in, not have to wait in line to order, have our food within 10 minutes, and enjoy a nice, quiet restaurant practically to ourselves. If you're looking for a casually delicious dining experience, this is your place. (Think of it as the more laid-back younger brother of Benjy's.)
