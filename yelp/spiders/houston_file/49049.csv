Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We thought that 8am was early enough to beat the crowd but we were wrong. We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait and it ended up being 40 but it was very obvious why there was such a long wait. They gave you free coffee while you waited and had corn hole and other games such as jenga/connect four to play at outside tables while you waited. The parking situation was less than ideal but if you are feeling rebellious there is a Walgreens right across the street that has signs that say "after 30 minutes you may be towed", we were not towed. I got the dish with breakfast potatoes piled with cheese, two fillings of your choice (I chose pico de gallo and camelized onions), and two eggs. It was extremely delicious and filling (add a side of sour cream for a dollar). The server was a tiny bit slow (they were busy) but he got the order correct, answered all our questions, and split our checks without hesitation. Overall, I would highly recommend this place on a leisurely weekend morning when you are not in a hurry!
