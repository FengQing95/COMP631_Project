Kata Robata////I have been here a handful of times. Ever since my first trip to Houston, I made it a point to stop here for dinner at some point if I'm in town. They are absolutely on point for service and food and you can expect quality and consistency every single time. This time was no exception. For the first time, I sat at the sushi bar and it was awesome watching them put together dish after dish. They have a great happy hour menu and, from what I could tell, the salmon and the ceviche were crowd favorites. I ordered my standby, the Kobe beef skewers. They are always tender, flavorful, fatty and juicy. Your mouth will thank you. I had a fresh duo of otoro sashimi pieces... out of this world tender. And finished off the meal with the picante roll. Appropriately spicy and a nice size piece for your mouth. I wish they still had the strawberry shortcake dessert I used to get but I didn't see it on the menu this time. Probably a good thing since I was already stuffed.
