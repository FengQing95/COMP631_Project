Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////INCREDIBLY mediocre food. We had the chicken fried steak, short rib chilaquiles, the king pancakes, and the fried. The fries were quite good and so were the drinks, but everything else was bland and unimpressive. The king pancakes were very oddly flavored, not a lot of banana and the peanut butter sauce was strange tasting.
