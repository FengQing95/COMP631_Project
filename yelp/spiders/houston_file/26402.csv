The Pit Room////After living 14 years in Kansas City before moving to Houston a few months ago, I feel like I am a pretty good judge of BBQ cuisine. This was the first such restaurant I tried after moving to Houston and it did not disappointâ€‹. Great smoke on the meats and I really enjoyed their sides too. Sauces in Houston are not to my typical KC liking, but The Pit Room has far better offerings for sauce than most other in the area. I will definitely keep this place in my regular rotation of dining options.
