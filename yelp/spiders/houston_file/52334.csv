Kata Robata////This place was disappointing on many levels. I tried so hard to like this place. I ordered dish after dish, thinking "this is going to be the one." It never happened. I wasn't even looking for that magical spark by the end of the meal, just something that would fill my stomach and wasn't boring or awful. I ordered the fried green tomatoes---salty to the point of being inedible. The slow cooked beef and pork belly, both sounded delicious. You can't go wrong with slow cooked meat....or can you? Pork belly had a great flavor but it was half fat. The beef had no flavor and was just greasy. Sigh. So then I ordered a sushi roll, I thought "that must be it, I just needed to get sushi." The roll was boring, I've had more exciting flavor combinations at HEB BUT the highlight was that it was completely edible. My bill was about $80 by the end of the night and I was still hungry. I'm all about paying good money for amazing food but when you have a night like this it's just ,well...sad.
