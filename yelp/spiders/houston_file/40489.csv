Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This establishment was okay in taste. I had the flatbread pizza and it could've been a bit more fresh when coming out. The fried oysters were a bit bland, but with the sauce that it came with, it was okay. This is a place where you can go on a date or get a quick bite. The scenery of this place was nice. Would've definitely sat outside if it weren't for the rain.
