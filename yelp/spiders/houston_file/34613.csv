Local Foods////One of my favorite places to catch up with friends when visiting Houston. Local fresh ingredients, responsibly raised, and healthy options but still quite filling. There is a generous amount sitting area for parties of all sizes, which again makes it a great hang out place. Parking can be tricky sometimes so plan ahead.
