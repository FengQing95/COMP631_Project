The Pit Room////Stopped by here after going to the car show. The line was out the door and the parking lot was full. The restaurant gives an old rustic bbq feel. You order your food and grab it like a cafe style then have a seat. They cut the meat in front of you and select the sides you like. The food was delicious! The green beans was on POINT and the elote was flavorful. I can't complain. I definitely plan on stopping by for another plate.
