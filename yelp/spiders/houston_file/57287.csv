Kata Robata////For sushi, I had the octopus and chuu-toro sashimi. I chose the tako just b/c you can't really mess it up. Flavor was mild, as it should be. Chuu-toro however, for 7.5, was a huge disappointment. Fishiness taste was heavily present (indicator of non-freshness). The more mild the flavor of your tuna, the fresher it was. Trust me, I've had fish from Tsukiji market in Tokyo. If you're gonna charge me 7.5 for slices like this then it should at least come to HALF the quality of what I had in Tsukiji. I also got a piece of Unagi sushi and that's nothing to write home about either. Just your average unagi; they didn't mess it up, they didn't really make it any better than unagi you can get at say, a grocery store. I WILL say that if you get the hot rock unagi entree, it tastes better. Maybe it's because you can douse it in sauce to hide the "normalness" of the unagi itself.
