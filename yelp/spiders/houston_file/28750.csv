The Pit Room////Smells heavenly and tastes so good! I had the brisket taco (to die for good), pulled pork taco (I preferred the brisket but pickled onions were delicious), and super spicy jalape√±o cheese sausage. My husband got brisket and a rib with "really good" beans and potato salad. Cole slaw is just okay. The carrots on the condiment bar are so delicious!
