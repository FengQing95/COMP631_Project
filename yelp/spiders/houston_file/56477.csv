Kata Robata////Oh well that was then, this is now.  I've been eating/slurping at Kata Robata since 2013.  I'm pretty much a lover of their spicy soy milk ramen with ground pork, al dente noodles, 2 half eggs, slivered green onions and a couple other goodies.  Despite this ramen being non traditional, quality ingredients are skillfully used to produce a very delish ramen.  I have it almost every time.  Hard to break the cycle it's that good.
