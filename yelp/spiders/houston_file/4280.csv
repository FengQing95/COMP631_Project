JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////HI AJ E. - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you have had repeated difficulty with seating during what I would presume are our peak-dining hours. As the late, great Yogi Berra famously once said about a restaurant in New York City: "Nobody goes there anymore -- it's too crowded."
