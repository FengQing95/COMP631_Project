Local Foods////I picked up the smoked salmon sandwich with a red potato salad and kale salad. The only downfall of the sandwich was that the bagel was borderline inedible. They had overbaked the sucker to the point where human teeth could barely penetrate. At least the bready interior was peelable enough to eat. That said, the filling was delicious. While the smoked salmon went against the concept of "locally sourced", it tasted delicious. The sweet-n-sour caramelized onions were fantastic, as was the accompanying cheese spread. The red potato salad was a double entendre: made with red potatoes and also covered in a chipotle-style red sauce. Kale was kale. I'm not a huge fan, but the fiance loved the raisin-pine nut dichotomy.
