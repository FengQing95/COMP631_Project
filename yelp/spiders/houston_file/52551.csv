Kata Robata////Came here based off recommendations from friends.  The seaweed salad appetizer was a great starter.  And I love the fresh sashimi.  Definitely on par with what I expected from reviews here.  There were many choices of rolls and sushi that I didn't get a chance to try, but will come back again to eat!
