Uchi////Ive been to uchi a few times now. One thing to know: small expensive portions. But so worth it. As with many restaurants the staff turnover is pretty quick but they do a great job training and I've never had bad service. The food is amazing, I've had quite a few of their dishes and have never been disappointed . I'm a huge fan of unagi and theirs is seriously the best in town. Overall definitely a five star place although you shouldn't go there expecting to have a big meal or leave with the sensation you're stomach will explode.
