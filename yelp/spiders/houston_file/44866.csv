Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The best thing about this place is the atmosphere and the aesthetics. Really cool/hipster cafe vibe with high ceilings and natural lighting that makes it feel fresh but also cozy. For sure an IG-worthy aesthetic they're working with there. I ordered a chai latte and vanilla scone. While it wasn't the worst latte or scone I've ever had, they definitely get more points for presentation than taste (if you're more about the CHAI than the latte part, then I say go for it). The cafe has a very extensive menu, so I'll certainly be back just to give other things a try.
