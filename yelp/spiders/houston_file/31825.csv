Local Foods////Awesome sandwiches, delicious sides, local ingredients. We met some friends here and everyone's plate looked delicious. I had the bahn mi, which featured crunchy slaw and jalapenos, juicy pork, and chewy bread. The bread was amazing. Our table probably had one of each side, and they were all delicious. I definitely see myself returning here soon
