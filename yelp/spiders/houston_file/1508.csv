JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The two things I didn't like about Jinya were the parking and the availability of seating. I came here on a rainy Wednesday evening, so we were able to get a seat, but I could see how the wait could be slightly long on a busy night. I'm not exactly sure how their parking works, but we ended up parking at the top floor of the garage, which was available for free to members of the gym that is attached to the other side of the garage. We just walked down the stairs and around the corner to Jinya from there. I had the Jinya No 1. Now I'm no ramen expert, but to me the ramen tasted so rich, so flavorful, I'm definitely coming back here. The waitress we had was really friendly & helpful and the food didn't take long to come out. They have a long list of items that you can add to the ramen with prices next to them. Overall, my experience was a very pleasant one. Ramen is the perfect fix to a rainy day!
