JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Starting Â with the appetizers, get some tempura fried Brussels sprouts, they're really good, crispy though probably should be served with a sauce as dry they're still good but could use a little something extra maybe a ginger miso dressing? Crispy chicken app is also first rate, it's clearly just a soy and ginger marinated chicken thigh tempura fried into a rather large chunk/nugget, this is served with a small side salad with an interesting green type dressing which I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was, but one thing is for certain it was delicious. Pairing this with their house hot sauce was divine, took these home reheated them in the oven doused them with wing sauce and powdered garlic for a late night chicken snack -- so darn good! Go with the 10 piece it's the best value.
