Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Some of you may not appreciate the morning line or hype, but really it's hypocrisy if any of you wait 2-3 hours for Franklin's or Killen's BBQ.  Common Bond draws you in with a chemistry-like attraction.  It's hot, ionic, and quite the draw at first.  You can tell the absolute craft and dedication that are put into these complex and filling pastries.  The flavors that unroll on your tongue with each bite and chew are mind-blowing.  (I'll try and keep this PG...)
