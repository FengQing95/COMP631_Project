Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Unbelievable. Visiting the Houston are for business, I had the opportunity to check this place out. First off, has a very rustic atmosphere, farm to table feel, with a huge selection of whiskey and friendly staff. I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Crisia. Everything she recommended was on point, from the poutine, to the bosscat burger. This place has only been around for 2 months but has the right stuff to stick around for a very long time.
