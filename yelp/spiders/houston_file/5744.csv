JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's all about the ramen, huh? Let's start there then: I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen, and let's say I was not a major fan. My main issue with the dish was the broth, as it was too thick and just not enough for the amount of food in the soup bowl. Even with a proper amount of broth, I don't think this was a stellar ramen. The noodles were not al dente and soggy, yet on the bright side, my pork meat was very tender.
