The Pit Room////Let me get to my main dish, the tacos. The brisket taco was delicious. The tortillas as hot and clearly made in house and so so good. The chicken taco had this amazing griddled cheese with garlic. I did pull out the cloves of garlic because it was a little overwhelming to bite into but it left an amazing flavor in its wake. If that cheese would have been on the brisket taco, omg.
