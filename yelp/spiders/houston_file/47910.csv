Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The big dilemma of brunch is always whether to go savory or sweet (unless you are like me and you just convince whoever you're eating with to order your 2nd choice and go splitsies). Snooze is brilliant because there's ways to get BOTH savory and sweet. I love that you can order a single pancake on the side and the options aren't just plain or choc chip.
