Local Foods////Tried Local Foods for the first time. Wife has been here before. I tried their Dinner Special Summer Shrimp Pasta. It was amazing! Pesto vinaigrette base with mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, onions, 8 pieces of shrimp, and an interesting shaped pasta for $15. Portion was perfect. Plate came out hot so the dish wouldn't cool off and would stay warm. Highly recommend this dish.
