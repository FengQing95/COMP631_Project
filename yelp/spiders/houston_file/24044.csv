Uchi////I never thought I would find a place that takes their sushi more seriously than the sushi chefs in Japan! This place adds a delicious twist to all my classic sushi favorites. On top of that their wait staff (my waiter was Mike with longer hair) is very knowledgeable about what they are serving and are VERY service oriented. They will pour your water or beer already at your table when the glass is empty. They give you an idea of timing of wait for different items so you aren't sitting around wondering where things are. A very comfortable ambience rounds this experience to 5 stars!
