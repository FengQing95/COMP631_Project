Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We went as a group of four and arrived just before 10am on a Saturday morning. We ended up waiting a total of 2 hours. We were initially told an hour wait, they took my number and told me they'd text me when our table was ready. After over an hour and a bit of a grace period, I hadn't received a text so I went inside to check the status and I was told they had texted me and our outdoor table would be ready soon. I told the hostess I had not received a text and no we'd like to be seated inside because clouds were rolling in and it was supposed to rain that afternoon. She told me it would be a longer wait then. I take partial blame for not specifying an indoor table, however at most restaurants they do normally ask before placing customers outside. We waited a while longer and my husband went up and asked for another update, we were told our table would be ready soon. We waited a while longer in their crowded waiting area (because it had in fact started down pouring), until finally we were told our table was being cleaned and just about ready.
