Uchi////I really hate to write a review that's an almost identical regurgitation of what someone else has written - but have to give 5 stars to some of the best food I've ever eaten. Sublime. Magical. Surreal. Fabulous. Just think of a superlative and insert it. Our group consisted of 5 people and thankfully we made our reservations almost a month in advance so we had no wait. Given that for three of us, it was our first time here, we let our superb waiter just pick what he considered the best selections, and he kept it coming. There was so much food and it kept on coming. Obvious standouts were the brussel sprouts, walu walu and the unbelievable fried milk for desert (followed closely by the lemon gelato and peanut butter semifreddo). The food kept on coming until everyone finally called "Uncle" - Â and that took awhile!
