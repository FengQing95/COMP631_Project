JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We had the carmalized cauliflower ($6)...just ok.  Too much lemon flavor.  Spicy cilantro shrimp ramen...$13 delish!!!  Jinya Chicken ($12) was a let down after the great shrimp dish.  We just ordered a 2nd Spicy cilantro shrimp!!  Several add ons available to customize your dish.
