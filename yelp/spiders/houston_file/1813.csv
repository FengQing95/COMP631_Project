JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We will always happily add toppings directly to the ramen bowls if the customer makes the request. But by default, we must serve toppings on the side. Also, specific ramen bowls are served with seasoned eggs as listed on the menu. We're never going to please everyone with every dish, but for future visits, just let your server know how you would like your bowl prepared and he or she will make sure to accommodate your preferences.
