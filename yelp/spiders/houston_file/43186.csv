Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of the top bakeries in Houston, located in the montrose area.  They are a boulangerie and patisserie, meaning they specialize on pastries and breads.  Parking is a pain, the weekends are usually a sh1t show (super packed).  they do have some outdoor seating.  High quality baked goods, coffee, and solid lunch/brunch menu as well.  Best times to go are probably weekday lunch to avoid the masses, or super early on any given day to get the freshest of the fresh.  They also accept holiday orders so you can be a rockstar to any holiday party.  All in all with this many reviews, I probably havent already said anything that hasnt been said before.  Definitely recommend to anyone, just expect parking to be a hassle.
