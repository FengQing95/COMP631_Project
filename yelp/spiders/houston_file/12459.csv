JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm very glad to know you enjoyed some aspect of our ramen, but regret that it missed the mark for you in some way. Yes, we do get busy during lunch, though I would say that is true for just about any restaurant in Midtown since there are many folks who not only work but also live in this area.
