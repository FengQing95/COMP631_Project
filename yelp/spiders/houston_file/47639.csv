Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Is it a good breakfast/brunch? Absolutely. Is it "wait in line for 45 minutes" good? No. It's about on the same level as Buffalo Grille, Empire Cafe, Lola, Dish Society, or Cafe Brazil, all places with comparably good breakfasts where I've never had to wait as long. Heck, I've never made a reservation at Weights+Measures for brunch and have always been promptly seated, and IMO that place is a step up.
