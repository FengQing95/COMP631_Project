Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Finally tried Snooze for the first time, and it was so worth the wait! I'm not big on waiting in long lines, so I waited til I could come early on a weekday. Waiters were so sweet, and the food was delicious. There are so many other things on the menu that I want to come back and try! I love how unique the menu is relative to other breakfast/brunch menus in Houston.
