Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////By far my favorite coffee shop I've been to! The line was out the door, but service was prompt. Everything you've heard is 100% true. Crossiant was fresh. Vanilla latte was delish, a sweet detail of the heart was a great touch. Cookie was cooked to perfection. Without a doubt, Common Bond lives up to the hype.
