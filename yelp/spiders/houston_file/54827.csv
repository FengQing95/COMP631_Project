Kata Robata////Have been a few times. The food is great overall and nicely presented. Service is good in general. But the place is always noisy mainly due to the interior design and layout. Thus it is not a ideal place for business meals or special occasions. Despite good food and high cost, sadly we have never had a blowing of mind experience.
