Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place exceeded our expectations!  The almond croissant was delicious as all of the other reviews.  We tried the bbq mushroom sandwich on the brunch menu and was a complex layer of flavor, making each bite better.  We will come back for brunch, but a little later in the morning as the morning line is still long.
