Kata Robata////My parents used to take me here a lot when I was younger, but then we eventually stopped coming for some reason. We were around the area and decided to stop by for some of my favorite food, raw fish! When we walked in, we were surprised to see that there was no wait and we decided to sit at the sushi bar. When sitting up there, the chefs are very nice to you, and it is fascinating to see them cut the fish right in front of you. You can also see how fresh the fish is, extraordinary!
