JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen noodles are thinner than what I consider tried and true, but I tasted an incredible broth and sauce that is tough to match at this Houston Ramen establishment. This place is perfect for a quick stop in the Midtown area and the adjoining parking garage has ample spots. The staff is very friendly and always attentive to refilling your glass and your requests. The Chorizo style "spicy chicken soboro" was a great recommendation and really took this ramen bowl out of this world. This has got to be on your Houston must try ramen list!
