JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm soooo disappointed in Jinya. I have been wanting to try it and it turned out not impressive. The waiter was nice. I went with my friend so we ordered some appetizers. We ordered crispy wonton, it was so so. Their takoyaki wasn't bad. I kinda liked it. Then I got spicy miso which really disappointed me. It was not flavorful. I didn't even finish my ramen which I normally finish it everywhere I go. I think I might give them one more chance. And I hope their ramen is better next time I go.
