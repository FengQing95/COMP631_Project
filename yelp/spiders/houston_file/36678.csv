Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love this place! Bosscat is one of the restaurant options that's walking distance from our apartment. I would have moved in just for this place alone! The food and drinks here are AMAZING, they never disappoint. I've been for dinner, brunch and just drinks. Ambiance is always upbeat and it's a great place for people-watching. We went for brunch for the first time recently and we wanted something from their regular menu but didn't think it would be possible. We asked and Terry, our waiter, went above and beyond to accommodate us. I'll be personally requesting him in the future, I hope he doesn't mind. I just LOVE great service when paired with good food too . I definitely recommend this place for lunch, brunch, dinner or just drinks.
