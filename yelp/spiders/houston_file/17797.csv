Uchi////Overall, Uchi was very,very good. So many good reviews below but my biggest compliment goes to the bar staff. I've been continously frustrated at the snobby attitude at most higher end bars in Houston (Anvil is a perfect example) but the bar team here is without a doubt, the friendliest and most knowledgeable team I've ever met. I really enjoy sitting at the bar and my dining companion and I had a blast with the team here. They made the night very memorable.
