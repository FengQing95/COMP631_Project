Uchi////Overall I think Uchi offers very good quality of sushi. However, as others' previous reviews- everything is very pricy there (eg. $10 for one piece of sushi). We ordered Omakase for two (10 courses), additional sushi (4 pieces) and hot rock (6 pieces of wagyu beef) otherwise I don't feel we have enough food (btw, I'm a tiny asian woman). Their desserts are the best- just my opinion. Must try fried milk. Steven and Victoria are great waiter and waitress. Remember to use complimentary valet parking behind their restaurant.
