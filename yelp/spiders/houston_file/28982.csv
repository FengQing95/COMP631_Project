The Pit Room////THE BEST BBQ IN HOUSTON!!!!!! I've been here several times and each time it's better and better! I love the brisket!!!!! It's AMAZING! So juicy and tender! A couple of the items on the menu have a Hispanic twist on them, which is awesome! If you love Mac & cheese... look no further!! This place will satisfy all of your BBQ desires! Also their bbq sauce... I could drink it!
