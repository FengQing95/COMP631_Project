Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////HRW menu was good. A bit overpriced otherwise and its very noisy (which is good if you're looking for a place that's always busy) but we found it hard to even hear each other over dinner. Otherwise, very fun place, good food, good drink selection. Would definitely recommend.
