Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Omg this may be my new favorite place in this area!  My coffee was amazing!  The pastries and desserts were incredible!  My salad was amazing!  Only downside was they didn't have ranch and my keto diet doesn't like sugary vinaigrette's, but it was delicious!!!  My daughter got amazing sliders and a huge amount of delicious fries!  Definitely coming back.
