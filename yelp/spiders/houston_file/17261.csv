JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My 14 year old daughter loves Ramen, so she suggested Jinya!  Now, I'm a fan!  The menu has lots of variety and does not disappoint!  On my first visit I ordered a small plate of crispy chicken and Spicy Chicken Ramen. The chicken was very flavorful and indeed crispy. It came from the kitchen piping hot just like I like!  The Spicy Chicken Ramen was delicious. It includes all my favorites: spinach, bean sprouts, green onion, and melt in your mouth chicken!  I love that you can choose your spice level: mild, spicy, or hot!  I ordered the hot and it isn't as hot as you would expect; more like Louisiana Hotsauce hot. You can either use chopsticks or regular utensils, I opted for the former.
