Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So we visited Snooze in San Diego and it was so good we came back again the next day. We thought it was from San Diego but then realized they have a location in our home town in Houston. OMG, this place has the best brunch and best bloody Mary's I've ever had. It's a must if you can stand the long wait.
