Local Foods////I usually go to the Kirby location but my mom and I decided to try this location out and it did not disappoint. I got the smoked salmon on the gluten free wrap with chips and watermelon. I also got the 7 layer bar. The smoked salmon was delicious and I'm always a fan of their gluten free wrap. The 7 layer bar looked and tasted like it was kind of old but the rest of the meal made up for it. Inside was packed but pretty clean considering the crowd and all of the employees were lovely.
