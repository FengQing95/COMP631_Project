Kata Robata////One of the highest quality sushi places around town! Considering how many sushi restaurants we have to choose from (just in the inner loop alone), I'd say Kata Robata is a cut above the rest. I'm rounding up from a 4.5 because even though it's not at the same caliber as MF or Uchi, it gets a bronze medal. Romantic ambience with dark lighting make for a perfect date night. Everything is on point. Service, drinks, food--all great. Get the lobster mac n cheese if it's your first go-round here. I especially love the miso black cod. Their dinner seaweed salad is excellent--several types presented nicely with wonderful flavors. I really enjoy the foie gras and rising sun roll. Can't wait to eventually try some ramen, which is suggested by a lot of my fellow Yelpers!
