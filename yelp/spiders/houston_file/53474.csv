Kata Robata////For the appetizers, we decided to order edamame and crispy calamari. The edamame came out first and just like every other restaurant, it tasted the same here and left me nothing to complain about. The calamari, on the other hand, was definitely something I could rave about. It was perfectly cooked, with the right amount of crunchiness and the sauces it came with made it all the more better. Too bad the same can't be said for the two sushi rolls we ordered...
