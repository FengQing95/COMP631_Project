Local Foods////My not so favorites are the crunchy chicken, which everyone raves about, and corned beef. I don't know about you, but when I hear "crunchy chicken" I think of a chicken breast cutlet battered in some type of cornmeal breading and lightly fried. When I got my sandwich, I was surprised to see semi-thick slices of chicken and the "crunchy" part was fulfilled by potato chips. I don't get it. What's so special about this one? Actually, both the chicken and corned beef were somewhat dry and flavorless. There's not enough other toppings in the sandwich to compensate either.
