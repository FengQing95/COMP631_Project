JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm crazy about this place! I eat here at least 3 times a week! The staff is the greatest, especially Rachel- the manager! She's extremely attentive and so funny!!! She makes you feel like family! My friends and I love it! The atmosphere and the food makes this place a gem in Houston!
