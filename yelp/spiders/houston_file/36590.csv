Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was my full intention to come here to libate but was quickly disctracted by all the food.  I was mildly hungry so managed to share the Bosscat burger and the fries with my sister. It was great burger, much what you can expect for this price range. Definitely better than most. I will be honest to say that what most excited me off the menu was the velvet churros.  As soon as I saw these on the menu, I knew my night was going change...for the better. You cant put churros in my face and expect me not to try them.  These red velvet versions were absolutely amazing and I encourage everyone to try them. I really like the vibe of this place everyone here was nice attentive and polite!  Shout out to the valet as well they helped me adjust one of the coverings of my car because I didn't know how to!  While I didn't get to try the drinks this time, I will definitely be back...I hear they will soon carry a fruity pebble french toast for brunch!
