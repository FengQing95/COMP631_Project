JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rohan - Thank you for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed your meal with us. You are correct: We can get pretty crowded during peak dining hours, but we do our best to keep the tables turning without rushing any of our guests. We also recommend visiting one of our other seven JINYA locations in the greater Houston area, as well. Thank you again, and we look forward to your next visit.
