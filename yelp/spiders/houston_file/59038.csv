Baby Barnaby's////This is an adorable little caf√© serving your typical diner-style breakfasts with good-quality ingredients. Portions are generous, and the waitress was very helpful in allowing us to sub out (fruit cup for bacon, English muffin for biscuit, etc.) I had the green eggs and they were delicious--they tasted like spinach artichoke dip. My husband had the BLT with eggs over easy and loved it.
