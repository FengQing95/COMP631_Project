JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I always get the tonkotsu black with the thick noodles, add ground pork, and it never disappoints. I've always brought my son because they have an incredible kids meal that includes chicken "nuggets", ramen, rice and some other sides for $7 (don't quote me, I just remember it's cheap). It's honestly enough food for an adult, but you gotta have a kid with you - whomp whomp.
