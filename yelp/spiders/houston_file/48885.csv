Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Way too long of a wait. We waited about 45 minutes to get a table only because we kept reminding the hostess. Then, it took about 45 minute wait for food. That being said, the OMG French toast was bomb af. It was really OMG. I also got the pancake flight: blueberry danish, pumpkin, and the pancake of the day. Pumpkin pancake was really good but the other two were okay. I tried my friend's hash browns and they were seasoned very well. I definitely recommend the place for the French toast.
