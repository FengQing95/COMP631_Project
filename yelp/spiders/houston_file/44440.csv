Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've always wanted to go here because everything looks so darn good. I tried their macarons and they're really good... it's more expensive than other places but the size of it is a litter bigger. I also had their lavender latte and it was so good!!! Im a sucker for anything lavender so I was so excited to try this. They have a lot of seats and its very open! Definitely going to come back to try their other pastries.
