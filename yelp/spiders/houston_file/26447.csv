The Pit Room////This spot is a Gem! I have been thinking of getting back to Houston and eating bbq at Killen's for at least 10 months! Well I must confess...for me Killen's hype isn't necessary anymore. The "Pit Room" is for real! Meat for meat match with any of the big name bbq joints in throughout Texas...I have toured this state eating bbq so I'm not without my stripes. Grades for the meats I ate at the "Pit Room" on 5/30/17: Brisket A++, Pulled Pork A+, Pork Ribs A+. And the basic sauce is Very Good...but not needed. I will give an update to this post on my next trip to Houston.
