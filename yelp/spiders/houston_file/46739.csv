Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Small parking lot, long wait but well worth the food. I enjoyed a mojito while waiting and it was a little on the sweet side. I enjoyed the fresh and fun menu items, which made it hard to choose what to eat. Â I decided to go with the breakfast pot pie which was delicious. It had a twist to it where it was an upside down pot pie which I really enjoyed. The crust was flaky and the gravy was just right. However, the pot pie was a little warm almost room temperature and that was a little dissapointing. I also ordered the blueberry pancakes which I was unable to get to bc the pot pie filled me up. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes.
