Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of bacon. My shrimp and grits was extremely tasty. My grits were cheesy and fluffy which made the consistency really nice for the meal. My only complaint was my bacon was chewy. Â wasn't cooked all the way but not enough to ruin my whole meal. If you go on a Sunday be prepared to wait! It's witty it though, depending on wait time I would just leave and explore things nearby and come back fern ready to be seated. Will be back!
