Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The French toast is very very good. Not too sweet. The burger is so juicy and flavorful. My favorite dish, though is the brussel sprouts dish. The bacon is cubed but thick and the onions are a little sweet. The brussel sprouts are not overcooked and still crunchy. It's so good. I also had a chocolate chip cookie which was great. I've been here twice and the service is always impeccable. They're fast and very nice. The iced chai latte is also good. Lots of cinnamon. And it's a beautiful establishment full of light because of the large windows.
