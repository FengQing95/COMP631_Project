Kata Robata////The spicy salmon rolls came first and were delicious, but I have to say that the soft shell crab rolls were the table favorite. Crunchy and fantastic! The oyster mushrooms, a dish I've never had before, were interesting, and the agedashi Â tofu and tuna tartare are always crowd pleasers. The pork buns were okay- I feel that pork buns from dim sum restaurant are better- but the beef tacos were good with some lime drizzled on top. The grand finale was the spicy soy ramen, and it was a delicious way to end our meal. It was not too spicy but still had great flavor, noodles, and a perfectly cooked egg.
