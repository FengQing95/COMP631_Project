Baby Barnaby's////I LOVE Baby Barnaby's! It is my favorite thing to do Sunday morning after staying out all night Saturday. I always get the breakfast platter: scrambled eggs, potatoes, whole wheat toast, and tomatoes on the side instead of any meat. And, of course, the freshly squeezed orange juice! I mean c'mon, how fun is it to watch that machine work it's magic!?
