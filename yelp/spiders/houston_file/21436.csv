Uchi////For my husband's birthday, we decided to patronize Uchi. It was his first time and he had been timid about trying the place ever since my crazy splurge on Happy Hour. He just didn't "trust" how someone could charge so much for Happy Hour. Â So, for his birthday, I took him to Uchi with the hope that he'd have an amazing gastronomical experience.
