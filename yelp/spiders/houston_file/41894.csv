Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Nice bakery in a fancy building with all the modern fixtures. Don't get me wrong, the pastries are really good but I'm not quite sure why there's always a long line and there's no parking. It kind of has the air of a place that douchey hipster yuppies or basic pinster girls overhype.
