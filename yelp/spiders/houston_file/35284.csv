Local Foods////I love Local Foods! I ordered the Garden Sammie with pasta salad and the Tuscan kale, and it was delicious. The whole meal was extremely satisfying, but it didn't feel heavy in my stomach afterwards. The ciabatta bread was so well baked and was super fluffy on the inside. Very well seasoned and tasty!! The overall ambience of the restaurant is super welcoming and rustic.
