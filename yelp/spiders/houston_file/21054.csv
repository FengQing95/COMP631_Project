Uchi////-Walu Walu ($6): At first bite it was kind of chewy...like not the good kind of chewy.  Kind of like jerky...so we told our waiter and they immediately brought us a new one that tasted MUCH better.  Flaky and soft!  They were very apologetic about it and quick to replace.  The candied citrus was super yum on top and contrasted flavors.  Probably wouldn't order this again though.
