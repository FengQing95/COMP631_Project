JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mariam - Thank you for your awesome, poetic review. I think you hit a lot of important notes, and I agree the daily lunch rush can get feisty, though our crew does its best to keep the wheels turning quickly. Thank you again for the kind words, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
