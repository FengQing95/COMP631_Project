JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The appetizers are nothing to write home about. The gyoza, edamame, and pork bun are pretty standard, and I find the Brussels sprout tempura semi-tasteless. The two starters I enjoyed were the kale lollipops and the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, which had great texture and flavor. The ramen itself is fantastic, though I typically like my broth a tad bit thicker and meatier. I prefer the pork broth (tonkotsu) over chicken, with thick noodles instead of thin. My go-to's are the Tonkotsu Assari or Tonkotsu Black, which come with mushrooms, green onions, and soft sliced pork belly. Don't be afraid of the weird-looking gray egg: it's the best part, with an umami marinated exterior and sweet molten yolk. They charge extra for a la carte toppings, but it's worth throwing in a few to soak up the broth and add some crunch (broccoli and Brussels sprouts work well). Pro tip: instead of paying extra to make your ramen spicy, just use the chili paste at your table. I also love that Jinya doesn't skimp on the noodles...you WILL leave satisfied. Top your meal off with some green tea mochi ice cream if you have space.
