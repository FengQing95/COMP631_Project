Local Foods////I am not from the area so I asked two different stores I was shopping in where to go to lunch. They both said Local Foods. I try to eat as organic as possible, so this place was perfect for me. Everything from the wine to food is locally grown. They have a number of items on their menu that have won awards. Perkins was absolutely amazing; however he is in the wrong industry because he needs to be in sales! He had so much knowledge of the menu. I will definitely be going back.
