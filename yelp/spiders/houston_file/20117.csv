Uchi////The quality of the food was top notch. The presentation seemed zen and in the spirit of the restaurant. Unfortunately over half our dishes were either just singular pieces of sushi (good sushi), or combinations that must have been channeling some Buddhist minimalism thing. In particular I remembered looking at one dish with apple, goat cheese, and tuna sashimi and laughing out loud because that's something I would eat standing in front of my fridge snacking. I shouldn't laugh out loud at your tasting menu.
