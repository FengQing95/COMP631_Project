JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The first time I went to Jinya was really great! A must have here is the Tonkotsu Black. It's probably the best seller here. The broth is very rich and creamy, and it has a tender pork chashu. My favorite is the seasoned egg, which is the half boiled egg, and I recommend adding it to any type of ramen.
