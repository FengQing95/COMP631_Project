Uchi////I had the omakase. The quality and freshness of the ingredients was exceptional and everything tasted great! It's a little fusiony for my personal preference and I prefer the more traditional nigiri omakase course, which due to its simplicity has to rely purely on the freshness and quality of the fish, skill of the sushi chef, and variety and uniqueness/exoticness of the different kinds of fish.
