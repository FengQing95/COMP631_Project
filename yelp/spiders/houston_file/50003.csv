Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Unfortunately, just as I'm trying to figure out how to get into the parking lot, I make a wrong turn and get into a wreck. My car is now gone (R.I.P. Mocha T.T), but I'm still at my destination; I say to myself, "I might as well eat while I call my insurance company." I sit outside where it's really hot but no one else is out so it's peaceful (couldn't deal with other people right then, you know?). I get served (ha) by the lovely Spoons, who keeps bantering with me to take my mind off the accident, and the heat but I didn't let that show. She gives me the full rundown of the menu and plenty of water and coffee while my indecisive self takes forever to order. Now, little did I know, my homegirl had a sweet pancake-y surprise for me. So, I'm enjoying a cinnamon roll pancake while this mental madness is going on.
