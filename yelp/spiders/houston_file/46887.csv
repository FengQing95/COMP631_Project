Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Wait was as expected. We arrived at 1255 and got seated at 230. They make it fun with cornhole and other games. Cappuccino and mm mimosa were amazing while waiting. Customer service and atmosphere is what gives this 3 stars. We sat outside on a beautiful day but you could smell the dumpsters right behind you. I've sat next to dumpsters outside before but this was disgusting. We didn't request outside..I guess you don't get an option and can't complain if it's such a long wait--better than nothing. Value is good for what you get taste-wise. If you don't mind paying 7.75 for one pancake. I ate the Benny Benedict. Portions were small so I ordered a pancake on the side. Pancakes were delicious! Basic food service skills were lacking: server gave us a bottle of cholula sauce with 3 drops left in it. Fork was bent and hurt my mouth so I asked server for new one. No refills on water. I know it's a lot to ask for, but if a Manager had come out to check on us or something close to that, it would've made a HUGE difference. Food takes long by the way so order as soon as you get seated. Won't be back unless it's during the week. Food didn't make it that worth the wait. For tourists, service does not meet expectations.
