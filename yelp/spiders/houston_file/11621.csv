JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yeah... You can definitely see that Houston bartenders don't need to be licensed. A gin martini should be one of the first drinks anyone learns how to make. It is also NOT shaken, as James Bond would imply, but stirred. Also, unless you ask for a Churchill martini, which Is just chilled gin, you put vermouth in it.
