JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've visited here 3 times, and cannot get enough of the ramen! My hubby and I travel a good 30 minutes from home to eat here and it's well worth it. I would give 5 stars, but the service is somewhat lacking. Our server normally forgets to bring our drinks until after our food comes the past 2 times we've ate here, but I look past it for how well the food tastes. I understand it can get packed, but don't forget about us. Â We've yet to try anything besides the ramen, but as you can tell from the review, the ramen is what keeps us coming back for more.
