Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Despite the parking issues and the heat inside the restaurant, my time at Snooze was lovely. Â I enjoyed the environment and my waitress, Heather, was very kind, charismatic, and even gave me one of the best breakfast pot pies I've ever had. I look forward to coming back and trying more things.
