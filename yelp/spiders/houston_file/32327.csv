Local Foods////Not your typical sandwhich shop. My favorite was the lemon grass soup, but I had to add veggies from the platter I ordered to give it some sustance. If you like to spice your food you might want to bring your own salt and pepper. Everything is fresh, healthy, and delicious but can be thought of as bland.
