Baby Barnaby's////The OJ! Delicious (fresh squeezed)! The breakfast was pretty darn good too! All the staff were very nice, and the place was hopping busy but they were attentive, cheerful and not rushing people out. I recommend you get the potatoes with your order! And I can vouch for the bacon, it's the good stuff. The toast is thick & chewy & there is real chilled butter and a caddy of yummy jams right on your table.
