Kata Robata////Really good. The Kobe is kind of expensive but that just means it's real. The waiters know the inside and out of the menu. The sushi isn't the freshest but sill tastes pretty good. I wouldn't go for the Japanese vegetables again but that's a matter of taste and other people might think they taste authentic. I just think the sweet salty balance is off.
