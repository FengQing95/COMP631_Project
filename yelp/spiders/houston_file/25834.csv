The Pit Room////I usually come in and eat ribs and brisket and am always happy but this time I stopped in to pick up some Chopped Beef sandwichs. The beef for the sandwich was already mixed up in a pot with sauce so it was basically a "sloppy joe."  For a top notch BBQ restaurant I would expect to have the meat cut from the brisket and chopped in front of me and asked if I want sauce or not.  Ownership should really rethink this.
