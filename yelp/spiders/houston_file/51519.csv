Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First off, the food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS! I'm a breakfast person so you can't go wrong with anything breakfast related when it comes to my palate, but the flavors you find here are always mind blowing! I love pancakes and French toast, but they also do a great job with savory breakfast meals too! FYI: The food choices change based on the season, so some of the things I post may not be available when you visit.
