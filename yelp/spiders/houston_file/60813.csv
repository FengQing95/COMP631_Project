Baby Barnaby's////My husband and I came here today for the first time. We won't be back. The food was very basic; nothing memorable at all. The wait was not a big issue since we often have to do that for Sunday brunch, but the waiting area is very limited and during a rainy day is not good. You have to find a just right spot to wait where you're not being dripped on. Then while we were waiting a table that came well after us was called before us! Â The waiter, I didn't get his name, older gentleman, was very nice. The service is quick, but I truly can't say that's a bonus. It was almost like fast food quick.
