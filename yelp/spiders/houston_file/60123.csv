Baby Barnaby's////Come early or be prepared to wait 15-45 minutes.  Upon arriving do not wait to see a host/hostess, just sign your name on the clipboard and grab a cup of coffee to wait.  The location is right in the middle of Montrose with ample street parking throughout the neighbourhood (just be mindful of 'No Parking' signs).
