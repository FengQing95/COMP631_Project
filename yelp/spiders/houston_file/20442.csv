Uchi////We went in for early dinner and our waiter (Steven) was extremely rude. We have some dietary restrictions and he was extremely sarcastic about it all. When we asked about a certain fish, he proceeded to be sarcastic and taunting and then tried explaining us the definition of "vegetarian". I never leave bad reviews but this was the worst experience. Especially when you're going to such an expensive restaurant and you get taunted for your religious restrictions. NOT returning
