Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have had the pleasure of eating Dominique Ansel's DKA's in NYC, so the Common Bond kouign amann had a lot to live up to, and unfortunately it just didn't even compare.  It was pretty hard to bite into in some places.  Plus, the crystalized sugar/butter was so thick in some places that it stuck to my teeth as soon as it was in my mouth.
