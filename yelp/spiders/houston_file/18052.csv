Uchi////My only qualm would be with the wine selection, which is slightly overpriced and not nearly as imaginative as the cuisine - do we really need Poema Cava, offered per glass at the same price as it is per bottle at Specs, on another wine list in this city? Even with that caveat, Uchi will definitely be on my list for the next special occasion.
