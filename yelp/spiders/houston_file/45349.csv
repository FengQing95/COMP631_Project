Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their whole selection is great, from breakfast to dinner. My favourites are steak & blue cheese salad, butter croissant and hazelnut muffin. Lavender latte is very delicious, as well. If you don't like it that sweet, ask for half of the syrup. Great place and great atmosphere.
