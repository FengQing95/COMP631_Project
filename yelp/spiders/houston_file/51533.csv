Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Boy this place was packed and we had to wait for half an hour but don't worry, the wait was worth it. I got a mix and match of two egg Benedict plates: I like you Elote and Goodman. It came with a hash brown which was pretty yummy. My bf ordered an egg omelet which he said was so good. For my plate, I really really loved the Goodman. The flavor was out of this world and I will so come back for that. The elote one was really different because they have corn in the batter under the egg instead of having toasted bread. It was really good at first, but I felt like the corn was too much by the end of the meal.
