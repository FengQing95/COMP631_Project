Kata Robata////I ordered two things, Toro + Takuan and Hot Stone Unagi Bowl. The Sushi I thought was lacking in substance. Especially compared to the other rolls that were brought out before mine. Maybe I'm an odd guy but I like it when there is lots of rice on the roll. This had almost none. Next was the rice bowl soup. His would have been fine but it was brought out still in its pan it was cooked in. The problem was that because it was left in the bowl so long that it burnt the food!! I couldn't believe it!! I honestly don't think I have ever been to a restaurant and had charred food served. I couldn't finish it. A rare occasion as I have been known to use the bread to clean up the remaining sauces to clean the plate.
