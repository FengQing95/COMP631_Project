Uchi////I absolutely love this place.. They always provide great service with a smile. I would recommend the Shiishito peppers, machi Cure, Walu, duck jar, Brussels sprouts. You really can't go wrong at this place. Go in with an open mind and you will be surprised with what you like. I did not like Brussels sprouts or duck before coming here.
