The Pit Room////I'm from the Northeast and it was my first time in Texas so I looked all over Yelp for some good Texas BBQ. The Pit Room did not disappoint, so many great choices to mix and match, great location, and quick service! The brisket, pulled pork, and chicken were our favorites. As for sides, the elote, coleslaw, and beans were the best! I may need to go back before my flight home!!
