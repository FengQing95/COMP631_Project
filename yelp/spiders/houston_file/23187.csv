Uchi////Been on my radar for about 8 months to try out. Have checked out on Yelp and with such great reviews I was even more excited to check it out. Finally, for a b-day dinner we landed at Uchi. First off the staff was super nice and accomodating, we got a great welcome coming in the door. Not the one where employees are required to welcome you, but they felt genuine.
