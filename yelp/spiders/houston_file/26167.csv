The Pit Room////Heard a lot about this place so we decided to check it out. We went with friends so we decided the best way to try everything was to order the Feast platter. If you are adventurous or undecided this is the route I would suggest. Everything was pretty good. There was not anything on the platter I wouldn't eat again. The brisket and the beef rib were the stand outs for me. Additional we ordered the chicken and both pies, sugar cream and cherry, as dessert. The building is small with limited seating they do however own the bar next door called the patio and the weather was good so we sat there. It was a nice place to dine. Turns out at the patio they were boiling crawfish so we had to order that also it came with all the expected sides, potatoes, corn, and sausage. It was very good. I guess we arrived at the right time as there was not much of a line but by the time we left it was out the door to the street. The only negative for this place is parking, finding a place might take a while.
