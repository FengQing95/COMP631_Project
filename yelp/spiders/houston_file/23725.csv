Uchi////I might get some flack for giving them 3 stars but I think there's overhype for this place. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I think there's a misconception about this being a traditional or even modern sushi restaurant when in fact it's really an upscale Gastropub offering gastronomy type dishes. I thought presentation of their plates was beautifully crafted and their dishes were unique but for the amount of money we spent that night I felt their service was a little lacking and food unnoteworthy. I think their execution failed to match the hype and therefore their dishes did not leave a very memorable experience for me (aside from their foie gras nigiri, I could eat a whole plate of that). It's certainly no n/naka but I think they're good enough for a revisit.
