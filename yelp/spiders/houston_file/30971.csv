The Pit Room////I was visiting friends and family for the 4th of July weekend and was excited to explore the area.  When in Texas, the obvious meal choice is authentic barbeque!  Fortunately the Pit Room was open and surprisingly didn't have an insane line in the early afternoon.  We got in line was able to order within 15 minutes of waiting.
