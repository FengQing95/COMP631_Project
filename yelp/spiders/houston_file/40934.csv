Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Really enjoyed the food, drinks and the atmosphere! The Bartender was extremely helpful, answered all questions and I never felt rushed because the restaurant was completely packed. I think the Bartender's name was Dar and I'll be visiting again... I forgot that I had the shrimp and grits mmmm!
