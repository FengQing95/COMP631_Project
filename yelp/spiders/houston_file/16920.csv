JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was only my second time having ramen and I've heard amazing things about Jinya. I tried the vegan bun as well as the vegan spicy ramen. The bun was really tasty and the ramen was satisfying. I think it had great ingredients but I didn't love the broth. I added a few of Trader Joe's vegetable pot stickers and that definitely helped. My rating is more a 3.5 than a 4.
