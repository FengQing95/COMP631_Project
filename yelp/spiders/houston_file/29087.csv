The Pit Room////The food: I usually get the 2 meat plate with brisket and pulled pork, and its pretty good! The plate comes with 2 sides (I usually get mac and cheese and beans) and a slice of white bread. They try to give you a mix of fatty and lean brisket, and there is a notable difference in flavor between the two. The pulled pork is my favorite thing here, and while some might find it a bit salty, I think its seasoned and smoked perfectly. The sides taste good, but are not as good as some of the other BBQ joints around town. The various sauces are pretty good as well. One thing that I have noticed, is that when my friend asks for a lb of brisket as opposed to the meat plate, he has been able to specify whether he wants only lean or fatty, which might be a good option if you don't care about sides.
