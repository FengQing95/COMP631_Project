Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We also got the peanut butter cup pancake. Wow, so creamy! I've never really had pancakes without syrup before, but this one didn't need it. For some reason I was expecting it to taste more like Reese's peanut butter cup, but I would say it just taste more like creamy peanut butter. I still really enjoyed it while it fell a bit flat for my husband. So I'd say don't knock it until you try it! Can't wait to come back and try other menu items now!
