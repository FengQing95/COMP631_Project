JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Unpacking everything at home was straight forward & instructions were provided. The broth is separated from everything else & once I followed the step and combined both bowls- I slurped my way through the entire meal! I ordered the wonton chicken ramen and it was perfect! The broth was flavorful, the noodles were perfect and the wontons were soft & savory.
