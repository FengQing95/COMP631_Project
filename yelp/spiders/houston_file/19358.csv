Uchi////I had no idea what to expect before walking in, but couldn't have been more impressed.  Dimly lit (but not too dark) with Instagram-worthy lighting fixtures.  It was just small enough to be cozy, but large enough to feel open and spacious.  Even though I wasn't interested for this particular occasion, it would have been fun to sit at the bar and watch the chefs work their magic.  Maybe next time.
