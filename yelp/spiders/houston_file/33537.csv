Local Foods////I'm one of the very few people who openly admit to liking egg salad. I lump it with foods like jello salad and squirt cheese, where people will always feign disgust when you admit to liking them-but they're mysteriously finished or empty when you go to get some? Hmmm. This is not an egg salad that anyone will be embarrassed to openly love. It was very tasty.
