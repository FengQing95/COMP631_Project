Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome brunch spot! I'm partial to the Benny Goodman dish because I love me some smoked salmon, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. If you can't decide between a couple of their benny dishes, you can go with the Benny Duo where you can try half of each dish. I love that that's an option! Also, you can't dine here and skip one of their pancakes or french toasts. I ordered the OMG French Toast during my last visit and it was really tasty! I thought that it had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.
