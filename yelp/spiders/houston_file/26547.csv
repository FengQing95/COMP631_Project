The Pit Room////Just have to say that I try not to eat meat but went here with friends. I ate the sides and they ordered the brisket. I was sandwiched between both friends and smelled the brisket and saw the juices on the slices of meat and decided to take a taste. It was hands down amazing, amazing and amazing. A must go to when in Houston. Based on the reviews of picky teenagers the meats were outstanding as well. The sides were also good but stay away from Mac and cheese.
