The Pit Room////When I was first introduced to the Pit Room, I had high expectations because everyone in my circle were talking about how it's amazing BBQ ribs and I would not be able to stop at just one. Turns out, they were right! The are some of the best briskets and ribs I have ever had. Not only are they juicy and full of flavor, but the meat is so tender it slides right off. That's the kind of ribs I love to eat. And what's even better about this place is that the portions are enormous. My family and I got 4 servings of ribs but we were only able to eat a third of it because of how much they give you. The price is on point while the portion is definitely worth it. One thing I have to point out is their pulled pork must be made of heaven because it is delicious. Most pulled pork I've had at BBQ joints get stuck to your teeth or the roof of your mouth but these? These are incredibly tender.
