Uchi////I literally cannot believe that I have not reviewed Uchi yet considering I have been here soo many times. I came to Uchi the first time in March 2012. I still remember it like it was yesterday. This place has been reviewed so many times that I can't even think of writing something that hasn't already been said. I will focus primarily on my latest visit which was for the HH aka Social Hour as they call it here.
