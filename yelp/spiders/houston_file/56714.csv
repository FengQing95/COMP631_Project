Kata Robata////Their sushi is delicious and fresh, with some really good items on the specials menu. Very high quality fish. Their spicy lobster ramen is AMAZING. Even my husband, who doesn't normally like spicy food, loved the ramen. I don't know why it's not on the regular menu but it seems to always be on the daily specials menu.
