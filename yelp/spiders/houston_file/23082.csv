Uchi////I will say this, I was a little surprised that they don't seem to offer more traditional sushi, I asked if their Ebi Tempura came with the shrimp head, and was informed that it wasn't so I asked if they served Ebi with the head at all on their menu... nope they don't. Their Wagyu beef was American Wagyu beef, which is drastically different from A5 Japanese true Wagyu beef.
