JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came in a little after 9pm on a Friday night and got a table right away for 3, which was funny because I had just called them a couple minutes earlier to ask for the wait and the man answered 30 minutes. So it was a very pleasant surprise! The place is very spacious and has a very nice ambience to it. Overall, service was wonderful. The waitstaff constantly checked up on us and were super friendly.
