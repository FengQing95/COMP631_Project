Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just went to Common Bond for the first time and had a great experience! I got the chef's scramble and it was delicious! All the ingredients were really fresh. The toast that comes with it is some of the best toast I've ever had. Go to common bond if you get the chance!
