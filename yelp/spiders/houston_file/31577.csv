Local Foods////I really didn't expect this place to be so good. I mean, how good can just a sandwich be? I got the duck confit sandwich, and my girlfriend got the crunchy chicken sandwich. I really liked the kale and slaw, and my girlfriend liked the housemade potato chips. If I still lived in Houston, I would go here much more often for lunch.
