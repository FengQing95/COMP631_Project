Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2-14-2017 Business partners in today and two of them wanted to eat at Snooze. Called for information and was on hold for ten minutes when we hung up. Went to the Breakfast Klub and was impressed. Snooze, it does not matter how good your product is as you will be out of business if you take your customers for granted. Now there are four more people who will not be back.
