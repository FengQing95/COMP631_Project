Uchi////Uchi's Houston location does not disappoint.  The quality of the sashimi and nigiri is on par with anywhere in town - but where Uchi excels is the fusion dishes, blending Japanese flavors in a way that traditional Japanese restaurants don't.  Nice wine list and can't miss desserts make it worth the substantial price tag (~$100/person for dinner and drinks).  Like the Austin restaurants, they nailed the atmosphere, ensuring that it will be one of Houston's hot spots for dining for the foreseeable future.
