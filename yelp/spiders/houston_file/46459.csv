Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place has the potential to be amazing but it just isn't. The bakery items like macarons, croissants, cookies, and scones easily deserve 4 stars for deliciousness but the service is lucky to earn 2 on a good day. Employees and cafe cleanliness leave a lot to be desired, almost as if they would rather they not have customers at all. Of all the pastries I've tried there, this ("fresh from the oven") blueberry muffin was one of the most disappointing. It was crumbly to the point I couldn't eat it without a fork and the crunchy texture of the sugar topping was just absolutely off putting not to mention overly sweet. Wish I could say it was just an off day but seems to be an ongoing downward trend.
