Kata Robata////Some sushi pieces came out quite nicely: Kata Robata does a king trumpet mushroom on rice, as well as avocado, just like Uchi does, but the taste is not quite there yet. Kata Robata: if you read this, add more butter to the mushroom, and upgrade that sushi rice. You'll hit a sweet spot soon.
