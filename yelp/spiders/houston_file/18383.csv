Uchi////I went there during Happy Hour (5:00 - 6:30). I gave this restaurant 4 stars for the price of Happy Hour, which is 50% off original prices. If I came here and had to pay $$$$ for the dishes I ordered, even though the size would be bigger than the Happy Hour size, I would be very upset, as I don't think the food quality lives up to the normal price. But then, overall, restaurants in Houston are inferior to those in the other cities I have lived in, including New York and Kansas City. So within Houston, this is the 2nd best Asian restaurant I have been to (the best one is Kata Robata).
