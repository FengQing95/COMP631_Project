Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything that everyone is saying about their croissants is true. They are the fluffiest and most buttery I've ever had. It is a joy just pulling it apart, especially since it is so big. From the pastry bar, I also tried the ginger scone, along with PBJ and pistachio macarons. The ginger scone was soft and tasty as well, and the ginger was a very good choice of add-in. The macarons' texture were on point, but I enjoyed the pistachio more than the PBJ though. The peanut flavor was overpowering the jelly in the PBJ, but the pistachio flavor was very accurate and not too sweet.
