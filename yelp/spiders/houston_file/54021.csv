Kata Robata////Food, service, and food presentation were worth the price. Im not a fan of rolls with mayo or cream cheese and they had a great selection of those. If for some reason you're not going for sushi, they had a pretty extensive menu for other food options (ramen, etc). I've said it before, but I'll say it again, there's no way to walk in Fri - Sun night w/o reservations. There were people still waiting when we walked out that had been there when we got seated.
