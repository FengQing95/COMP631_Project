The Pit Room////Pretty solid BBQ for the location! If you're ever in the Montrose area, you'll undoubtedly hear folks recommend that you try out The Pit Room for good Houston BBQ. As a resident of the area, I have to say that one of the great perks of this place is that you don't have to drive miles outside of the loop to enjoy the BBQ. It's right in the middle of everything else in Montrose.
