Uchi////The best part about Uchi was the service AND DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT. I don't know what the heck people are talking about with the overbearing service?? What? You don't like your food brought promptly to your table by the next available server? Gee, so sorry. Every server knew exactly what they were serving and could answer any question you had (and believe me, you'll have some). My water, nor wine glass were ever empty and I was very impressed with their laid back approach to ordering. Order as you go, order it all at the beginning, order later, order next Tuesday.... it didn't matter. Whenever you're ready our waiter would say. And as it should be.
