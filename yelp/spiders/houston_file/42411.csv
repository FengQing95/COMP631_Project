Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////plenty of pastries that my friends said were super flakey and good (didn't get one myself, not a pastry person). I ordered the sausage and egg sandwich, which was pretty delicious, albeit on the pricier side (~$12). My friends also enjoyed their quiches and lox, but everyone said their pastries stole the show.
