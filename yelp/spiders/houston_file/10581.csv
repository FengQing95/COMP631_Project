JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried the Brussels Sprouts Tempura and the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen. While the ramen was fantastic in texture and flavors, the brussels sprouts tempura was longing for a sauce or some additional seasoning - we just dipped it in some of the standard spicy sauce that's kept on each table, and that helped elevate it quite a bit.
