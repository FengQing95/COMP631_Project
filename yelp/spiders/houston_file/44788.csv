Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went twice recently. First, with two friends on a Sunday morning, and we ate outside to take advantage of the wonderful Houston winter weather. The next time, I sat in the middle of the restaurant, asserting my position in society as a serious yuppie. Â I ordered the pain au chocolat croissant the first time I visited, and the almond croissant the second time I visited just one week later.
