Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This used to be a pretty solid bakery, then it was purchased by Johnny Carrabba and it has since gone down hill. So much of this place is problematic. We recently came for breakfast/brunch on a Sunday morning. 1 guy takes your order for pastries/coffee then sends you down the line to cashier to order something off the weekend menu. Super inefficient and creates an artificially long line. Once we ordered our pastries we had to ask him to give them to one of us FOUR times while he was off chatting with one of his coworkers. They also added TV screens for menus in the background, taking away from the view of the bakery. In my opinion it looks super tacky. Customer service wasn't much better. My fianc√© was trying to get a high chair outside for our son and four staff members just walked right by her as she was having trouble opening door without an offer of help. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and chicken and biscuits. The biscuits and gravy was disappointing compared to previous visits. Whereas in my previous experience they would slather the biscuits in gravy, there was barely enough to get some on the biscuit as you ate it. The chicken for the chicken and biscuits, while well fried, was very bland. At least the pastries still tasted good, but for the price, it's not worth the visit if this will be your experience.
