Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had the hash and avocado benedict. Both were cold. I think the avocado and cold tomatoe on the benedict just makes the whole ensemble cold. Better if they grilled it. As far as hash not sure why it was cold. Service was horrible. No "can I get you sugar for you coffee, salt and pepper or anything else". No two minute rule "how is everything". Just dropped the food off and then dropped the check off. And when we told the waitress about our food being cold, no apology, no making it right, nothing. That's why you got a 1% tip. It's not hard to be a thoughtful waitress, but evidently some people are just not cut out for it. Won't be back.
