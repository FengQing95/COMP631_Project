Local Foods////I can't express how great this place is in words! Fresh ingredients all from local farmers, etc. Everything was fresh. Truffled egg salad is to die for! I had leftovers and ate it 5 hours later. it was still the best egg salad I ever had. The ingredients are so simple, but the flavors definitely complements one another. Blew my mind! My boyfriend and I was like one of the best sandwiches ever! My bf got a salmon sandwich. I'm drooling right now... Haha. Anyways, you get two sides with the sandwich. It's pretty expensive... $10 per meal. It's not Subway people and it's taste so much better. Try any sides, you won't be disappointed.
