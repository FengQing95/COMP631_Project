Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is very cute and beautifully designed. It was very busy when I visited and there was a line at the door. However, it moved very quickly and service was great! There was a lot of delicious and well presented pastries and desserts. I wanted to try them all, but decided to try that popular pistachio croissant I saw on yelp. That croissant was HUGE and DELICIOUS. There was a filling inside that tasted somewhat like mung beans. I also ordered the LOX and a lavender latte. Both are also good. Overall, cute shop, great atmosphere, delicious food, good price, and great customer service. Nothing negative to say to be honest. Will definitely keep this place as a favorite when I come back in town.
