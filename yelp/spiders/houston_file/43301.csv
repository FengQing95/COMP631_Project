Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is such a cute place to begin with! I really liked the simple and clean vibe going on. I went ahead and ordered the Korean BBQ which was amazing! The meat was tender and flavorful! I also ordered a Vanilla Latte which I honestly didn't end up liking it. It was a little too bitter for my taste (keep note that I'm not a true "I like my coffee black" drinker). I would come back to try the desserts! I didn't get a chance to try any but they looked so cute!
