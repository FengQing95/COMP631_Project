Uchi////Probably the best Sushi restaurant, ever! And yes, you certainly pay for it, ouch! The Hama Chili was my favorite and the hot rock beef plate was darn good as well. The fried milk and chocolate was an amazing desert!  The place is slightly cramped for a Houston restaurant, but otherwise a great place to dine at.  Will be back when my wallet lets me!
