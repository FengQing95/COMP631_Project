Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place -- folks who actually know how to pull an espresso shot properly and make one of the best lattes in town, paired with their delicious pastries, make this one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends.  The lunch menu is also interesting.  Parking, however, can be a challenge but it's worth at and afterwards, I enjoy going to the local goods shop next door.
