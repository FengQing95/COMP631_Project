Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We stop by whenever we're in town. I love the self serf coffee bar and how great their staff is. Waking in, you immediate check out the counter full of goodies and their bread racks. Totally recommend picking something up. We just split an orange cranberry scone and had to go for another!
