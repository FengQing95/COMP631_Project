JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Excellent yummy Ramen!! My bowl was huge and I couldn't eat it all. I got the Jinya Tonkatsu Black ramen bowl and it was delicious! I added an egg and traded the thin noodles for thick ones. I had a steamed bun as well which was also really tasty! The vibe inside was very cool and chill, with low lighting and modern decor.
