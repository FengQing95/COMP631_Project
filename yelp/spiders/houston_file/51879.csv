Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been here a couple times and the service has been really crappy i just left from eating today and our server literally passed by us 3 times before taking our drinks she had other tables and was engaging which is not a problem but when you're ignoring us and we're behind you isn't cool i have never typed a bad review EVER but this had me fed up because this isn't the first time we've had bad service here the food is good just the service is shitty she didn't bring us straws nor silverware we got our food and we were just staring at it we had to ask for silverware and then when it was time to pay no where to be found we had to walk to the front to pay they need help on hospitality! I love snooze so much the one in Webster is excellent but i moved closer to downtown and that's the closest one to me so it sucks when i want a good on the go breakfast but have horrible service.
