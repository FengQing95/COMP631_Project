The Pit Room////I wanted to check out the Pit Room after reading so many glowing reviews on Yelp.  I think some of these people need to go eat at some other BBQ restaurants for comparison, cause this isn't the holy grail by any means.  I ordered the 2 meat dinner: sliced brisket, venison sausage, potato salad, and coleslaw, with a coke.  The portion sizes were for a child, served on a small cookie sheet, with the sides served in small paper containers.  The brisket was pretty good (nothing special), the venison sausage was overly dry (BBQ sauce was served in a small plastic container meant for takeout ketchup), the potato salad was bland with no texture to it, the coleslaw I couldn't even eat: no creaminess to it, more like it was soaked in vinegar.  There is an extras self-serve bar which consists of mostly pickled items.  Even the slice of white bread was stale.  This place is too expensive (about $20.00 for my meal) for this kind of quality, but the people were coming in.  One last note:  employees were hoovering over the very small dining area.  It makes me feel very uncomfortable when people are standing about staring while I'm trying to eat.  Certainly not the worst I've ever eaten, but would I go back: a resounding no.
