Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I finally decided to brave the wait to try this location! I went on a Friday at about 10:30 AM and I was fortunate because I got parking in the small lot, otherwise, street parking was quite filled. It was about a 30-40 minute wait for a table though and I believe I was told it would be 20 minutes.
