Local Foods////I tried the seasonal sandwich consisting of Roasted Chicken, Brie, Provolone, Arugula, Cranberries and toasted on wheat bread. It was such a great sandwich and I especially loved the chicken. The Red Skin Potato salad was yummy too! I ordered and paid online and it was ready when I walked in. Easy peasy!
