Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the "Benny duo" -- with the Ham Benny and the Caprese Benny.. Both very good. The star of the show in my mind were the hashbrowns- my friend suggested I order them "crispy and flat" and WOW! I could have eaten a whole plate. My dining partner had the pancake trio.. Blueberry, some type of banana special, and a peanut butter chocolate one. They were very good & so was her side of bacon! Crispy and thick without being stiff! Perfect in my mind. I loved how you could mix and match food because sometimes you just want a little bit of everything!
