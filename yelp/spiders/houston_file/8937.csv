JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Personally, I'd recommend you steer clear of the side dishes and appetizers if you are dining on any sort of budget. Some are worth the splurge on a special occasion, but the dishes that people rave about in some of the reviews are really nothing much. The pork bun is not bad, but honestly, there are cheaper pork buns out there that taste better, and the size is just measly for the price you pay. Karaage is just Karaage, and you can definitely expect to pay extra for your fried chicken at a trendy ramen spot. The rice bowls aren't bad, but if you wanted to eat rice why not just pick up some fried rice from a solid spot in Chinatown?
