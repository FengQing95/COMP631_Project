JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Marlyce - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry if you may have felt rushed during service. That is wholly unacceptable, and I will be speaking to our servers about this in the near future. I will say as high-volume, high-turnover restaurant, we do tend to move at a quick pace, mostly to keep the wait times as minimal as possible. You had mentioned only waiting 15 minutes rather than the quoted 25 minutes. Regardless, we are very appreciative of your visit, and we hope to serve you again in the near future.
