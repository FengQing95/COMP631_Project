Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First off, there will be a wait if you decide to come in the mid-morning, so be prepared for that. Walked in and was greeted by the friendly host. She automatically put us (it was a group of three) on the waiting list. However, she did give me tip to just wait until three seats was open at the bar and we can sit there. Soon, there were three seats available and we just sat ourselves after. The bartenders were beyond attentive and great, the food was awesome and delightful! After telling them it was my birthday, they gave me a complimentary pancake and a mimosa! All was so wonderful for my dining experience especially with my order. Their omelette and hash-browns were awesome and plated beautifully. The overall atmosphere is very modern with a splash of chic! Trust me, going here will be worth the wait! I highly recommend anyone who comes out to Houston to visit here! You will not regret it.
