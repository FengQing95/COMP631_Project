Kata Robata////This place is outstanding!!! All of their fish are super fresh, especially the salmon and uni! The prices are a little up there but totally worth it because everything tasted great. Service was a little slow, but it's understandable because the restaurant was pretty busy. I would recommend this place if you haven't tried it. Definitely will come back :)
