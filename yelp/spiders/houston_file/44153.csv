Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every time I go, this place is packed, but understandably so. With awesome pastries and coffee to boot, Common Bond is easily one of my favorite cafe/bakeries in Houston. Come for the coffee/pastries, rather than the regular food menu though. Portion size is small and the food is just okay to me.
