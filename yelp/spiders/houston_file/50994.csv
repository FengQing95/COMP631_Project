Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We started with the pomegranate margarita. This is an AWESOME cocktail. It consisted of Espolon Blanco Tequila, orange liqueur, pomegranate shrub, house sour and fresh lime. Just the right of amount of alcohol to get a nice buzz. Only drink 2..... I also tried their hot chocolate. However, it is served in a tall glass with lots of whip cream. Be prepared to have whip cream around your mouth and a little on your nose.
