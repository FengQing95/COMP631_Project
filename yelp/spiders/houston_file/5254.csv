JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kim - Thanks for your feedback. I'm sorry you feel our restaurant is overrated. When it comes to our food, we respect our customers' opinions, but we would always hope to have the opportunity to offer something different if he or she doesn't fully enjoy our fare. We have more than a dozen different bowls of ramen, each with a varied flavor profile based on the ingredients we add. Regardless, we appreciate your giving us a try.
