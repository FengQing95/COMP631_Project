Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm so glad we stuck it out, the food and service was impeccable. My husband had the pot pie and I ordered the salmon bennie with GF toast. We were both impressed with presentation and each dish was absolutely delicious. The cream cheese hollandaise is sinfully decadent. Orange juice was great, too!
