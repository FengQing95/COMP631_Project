JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is a great ramen bar! It's not NYC, Japanese underground ramen scene, but it is still very tasty. They have so many options, and something definitely for everyone. Their buns are a perfectly moist, without being soggy, even if you order take out. I would recommend to call in your order if you want to pick k up, as it comes out WAY cheaper. The staff is always friendly and they have saved me by bringing me towels and such as I got stuck in torrential Houston rain as I was walking there. I am definitely a fan, and will be back again.
