JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I also had their side salad with the ginger dressing. Veggies seemed fresh. Do not let the salad sit though because the ginger dressing ends up looking like throw up and gets chunky. I don't like ginger but do like ginger dressings ironically. Most ginger dressings incorporate peanuts though, which this one did not. I ate two bites and was done with it, not literally, but did not want to waste space in my stomach since good ramen was expected.
