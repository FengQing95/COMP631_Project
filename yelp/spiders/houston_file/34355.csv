Local Foods////It was wonderful, and the vegan chili was also good. My husband met up with me and he had the crispy chicken sandwich and chicken orzo soup and really enjoyed it. He also had to try the potato chips, he loved them but I'm just not a greasy food person, so they just weren't my thing. I will definitely return when I'm in the area.
