Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////How wrong I was! Their almond croissants are amazing! Perfect flakiness, not overly sweet, and had some kind of almond paste inside. Chocolate croissants were delicious as well, but not as good as the almond. They also had some actual food items on the menu. I didn't order, but the portions were large and looked excellent.
