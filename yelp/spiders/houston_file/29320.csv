The Pit Room////After talking this place up with friends and family for two months I made it back here with a group of friends including an out of town-er only to have the place not live up to my own hype. Yeah, it was still good, but not as great. Mainly the brisket was dry and all gray without much of a smoke ring. This is just a straight up fail when you are taking a half dozen people to have "great Texas BBQ." Everyone enjoyed their meal, but no one was wowed including myself. Looks like I won't be coming back or recommending this place for a while as I try to get the egg of my face. $17 for a 4 star BBQ plate just isn't worth it... for this flavor and dryness of brisket I can go to half a dozen other places for cheaper.
