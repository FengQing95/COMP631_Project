Uchi////I really wanted Uchi to be a five star restaurant for me. I wanted it to be a dining experience to really remember. Unfortunately, it did not quite reach that high. Starting with the staff. The staff was very friendly. They were willing to walk us through the menu and make suggestions if we had wanted them to, and they were reasonably attentive. On the better end of the spectrum but certainly not amazing. The dining experience I found a bit disjointed and lacking. Dishes would come out when ready which makes sense I suppose, but we would end up sitting and waiting for long stretches of time. We ordered 8 dishes at first, one of which was the karaage. There was enough time for us to receive and eat 7 dishes, with those mentioned pauses, wait, order two more dishes, get those two extra dishes and eat them and we still had to wait on the chicken. The food was, without a doubt good. I particularly really liked the Hokkaido uni, which was a daily special. It was creamy and flavorful, with a good balance of wasabi. The walu walu and brussel sprouts were both good as well, offering unique and interesting flavors. I would have liked the karaage more if I had something to eat it with, like some rice, but alone there was just way too much sauce that was too salty and sweet to just eat by itself. The maguro and goat cheese was alright, but you really just lost all flavor of the tuna underneath the much stronger tastes. The four different makimono we got were likewise alright, but nothing special or amazing. I thought the sake toro was nothing special. I love salmon sashimi, and I really feel like at $3 per tiny piece, the sake toro was disappointing because it tasted like sake toro I can get at many other sushi places with much better cuts. Additionally, being particularly critical of the sashimi because it normally is my favorite, I didn't feel that they were cut particularly well, with pieces all being different sizes, and having an uncharacteristic chewiness. Like I said, I liked the meal, I wanted it to be a five star restaurant, and I would probably come back again one day, but there just wasn't any wow factors. Also, definitely try and make a reservation if possible. It will save you a lot of waiting.
