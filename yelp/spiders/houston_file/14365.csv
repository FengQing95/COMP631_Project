JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's 6pm on a Friday and when I went to order the spicy creamy vegan ramen they told me they ran out of the broth. Already? It's 6pm on a Friday. This is literally the only thing I come here for. I ended up getting the same ramen but it had the veggie ramen broth instead. Not the same. Sad!
