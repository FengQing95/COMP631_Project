JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While pricey and upscale in nature, this is hands down the most appealing Ramen Bar I have come across in Houston. They're probably among the extremely few vegan ramen options in the area and their creamy vegan broth is incredibly delicious. Despite being priced in the $12-$16 range depending on what toppings you add, the ramen is worth at least one try. The add on egg was a great choice and the seaweed was solid too. Perhaps the most convenient part is that they offer a $2 noodle refill that takes the value to another level since there's a strong chance you'll have left over broth in abundance. Tofu was also abundant in my vegan ramen so there's no need for extra tofu. Getting it spicy was also a good call as it added a nice kick to the flavor albeit they do charge a $0.50 up charge for spicy without clearly advertising as such. Fresh chopped garlic, on the other hand, can be ordered at will free of charge on the side so that's another great flavor enhancement that I would recommend for all you garlic fans out there. Overall, I suggest you try this spot at least once for the unique ramen flavor and the uplifting ambience!
