Uchi////So some summary tips: ask for a booth if you want a more intimate feel, don't overdress, maybe just order a few dishes rather than getting the omakase, and if you are confused you are not alone but don't be afraid to tell your waiter and demand a little more explanation and better service; don't let them rush you!
