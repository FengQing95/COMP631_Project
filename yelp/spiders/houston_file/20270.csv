Uchi//// The brussels sprouts were savory and saucy just amazing and I don't really like brussels. The Machi Cure comes on chips and they instruct you how to best eat it, pretty good solid dish. The Hama Chili, yuuuuum. The brie ringo was good--nothing spectacular. Something like a ragoon/cheese puff.
