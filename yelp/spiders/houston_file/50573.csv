Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For the most part I have experienced good customer service here, but my last go around the service left much to be desired. Our server forgot many items that were ordered by our group of 4 and we had to ask other servers to track her down several times as we could see her standing at other tables carrying on conversations for 5-10 minutes at a time. Not cool when you've just about finished your meal and are waiting on a side item and a drink that was ordered before our main meals. Hopefully this was a one time deal because I really enjoy this spot.
