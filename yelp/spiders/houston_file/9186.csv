JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////These noodles aren't going pick themselves up! Jinya has really great ramen!! It's really flavorful & tasty. The broth was great, I didn't find it overly salty. The meat was cooked really well and has tons of flavor. I love how you can customize you ramen if you choose to do so with additional toppings. The pork gyoza is awesome. I absolutely love dumplings so of course it was my favorite part. Their decor is lovely. It's a cute setup with bar seating as you walk in and table throughout the establishment. Usually a wait but not too bad and def worth it. Highly recommend this place for ramen on hot or cold days, either way it's a must try!
