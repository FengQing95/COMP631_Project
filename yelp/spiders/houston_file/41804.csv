Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you're a foodie who's not afraid to sacrifice your diet for one meal, this is a good place to do that.  This restaurant re-focuses food back to the art of cooking, quality ingredients, and well-balance flavors.  The bakery cranks out copious amounts of artisan breads and desserts, while the kitchen uses traditional ingredients like quality bacon to spice up any dish.  Just like any place trendy, however, there seem to be a perpetually long line and limited seating.
