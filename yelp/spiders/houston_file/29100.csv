The Pit Room////We picked the brisket, venison sausage, and pulled pork. All had great flavor. We were told the brisket is marinated for several days and smoked for an entire night. And you could tell how much work they put into it because it was tender and flavorful. Lots of pepper on the outsides. The pulled pork was moist, and probably my favorite (especially when dipped in the bourbon BBQ sauce they have at the self-service table -- which also has pickled accoutrement and salsa and other sauces by the way). The sausage was slightly spicy and good.
