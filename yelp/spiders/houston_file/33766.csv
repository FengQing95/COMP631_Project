Local Foods////The decor is nice. Clean, bright, airy, and relaxing. The menu selection is not bad. Ordering was quick. The fruit mix drink thing was good. Our sandwiches, pastrami, egg salad, and chicken, were pretty good. However, the sides were super disappointing. The salads were bland. The chips were greasy. And a lame, dry, no flavor orange as "local fruit?" All these could have gone better.
