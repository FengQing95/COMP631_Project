Kata Robata////I have only been here three times --for a first date lunch, for a second date for omakase (w a different person), and for happy hour. My experiences have all been great. The spreads, or food parades, have all been a delight to the eyes, and (most importantly) to the tongue. At the end, my tummy is always the best kind of sated: a fullness still tingling from the gastronomic delights. Additionally, the hosts, waiters and servers have the relaxed graciousness like the staff of good french restaurants. This is a place one can reliably expect to be culinarily impressed and still a vibe of a nice at-home dinner party w good people.
