Kata Robata////We have never had octopus raw and oh mah gawd! It was soft and flavorful, tender and sweet. There was nothing tough or chewy about this dish. Apparently our waiter, a delightful young chap with a mild Latin American accent, told us that he too enjoyed raw octopus a lot more than the usual cooked sushi variety that we all know. Great recommendation - kudos to our server and the chef who created this oh-so wonderful dish.
