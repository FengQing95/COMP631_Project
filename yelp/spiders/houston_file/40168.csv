Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My fiancé and I came here our first night while visiting Houston. Our server was Jen and she was a true gem. She was very sweet and attentive. Since we'd never been there Jen recommended their burgers. One bite and we were in heaven. It was so darn good. Fiancé was in the mood for dessert and Jen recommended their apple pie. I was a bit meh about it cause I'm not a huge fan of apple pie but when it came out I had to try it. It's like a deep fried empanada apple pie in caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream on top. Never in my life have I tasted something so delicious. We devoured it and each bite tasted equally delicious. We had a great time and loved our food. Will definitely come back here again.
