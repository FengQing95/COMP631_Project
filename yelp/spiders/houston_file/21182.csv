Uchi////Uchi was an incredible experience that actually filled us up, despite the small portion sizes. My girlfriend and I ate here late night for our 3 year anniversary/ Valentine's Day and the staff was wonderful. At least three people wished us a happy anniversary. I would come here every week if I could afford it!! We want to try their happy hour so we can sample the daily specials.
