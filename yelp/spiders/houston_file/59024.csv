Baby Barnaby's////So good....so, so good. I love when I find a unique breakfast spot, because, let's face it...breakfast is so repetitive. Bacon, eggs, waffles and pancakes. You really can't switch it up a whole lot from that. Here I was able to have an egg white scramble with cheese, spinach and ARTICHOKES. Yes...this tasted like that awesome Artichoke pizza you can only get in New York but healthier and way more delicious.
