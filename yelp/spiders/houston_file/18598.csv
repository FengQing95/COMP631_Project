Uchi////We were offered seating at the sushi bar and we decided to go for it. Our server was very friendly but again, given the number of people that night she seemed a bit frazzled. We ordered our food from Nobu, one of the sushi chefs. We decided to just stick with the rolls. The menu is pretty similar to Uchiko so some of the recommended dishes were things we've already tried (like the Yobiko Berry). We decided on three rolls: Zero Sen (yellow tail, jalapeno, cilantro and flying fish roe), Bond (soy paper, salmon, avocado, sun dried tomato), and the ham and eggs roll. The food was without reproach; our favorite of the three was the Zero Sen
