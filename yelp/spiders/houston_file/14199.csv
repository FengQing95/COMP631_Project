JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my second visit to Jinya's, and It was an enjoyable visit. I came around the time it was open on Monday (at 11am), and it already had a lot of customers already. For appetizers, I had the spicy creamy shrimp tempura which was so tasty and delicious! I would definitely order this again. The brussel sprouts were ok. I ordered two eggs this time with the spicy chicken ramen. The eggs were delicious. However, this time I find that the soup base was not as flavorful as my first visits. I also didn't think there was much flavor with the chicken. It was still a good size bowl Â and was good overall, but it wasn't awesome this time. Perhaps it was a Monday so it was a little off, but Jinya's is a good stop for ramen and good appetizers anytime.
