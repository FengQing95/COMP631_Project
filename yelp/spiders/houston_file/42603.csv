Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place gets crowded and there's always a line no matter what time I have come at.  When it's your turn at the counter, you place your order, and if it's pastries it will be plated and waiting for you at the register or you order a hot entrée or coffee you will get a number and your food/drink will be brought out to you when it's ready.  The pastries look almost too perfect to eat.
