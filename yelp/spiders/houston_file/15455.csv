JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If you haven't been here you are behind or new to Houston. This is the best ramen outside of China town. Yes, it's a chain but it's absolutely incredible. The spicy chicken ramen is my favorite! (Try it inferno!! And get a seasoned egg and garlic to go with it) The soup is so flavorful, hearty, and has incredible bouncy noodles. I love to start with a seaweed salad. It's good, but kinda small. The chicken chashu bowl is also yummy but really get the ramen. I've tried other ramens they offer but always come back to the spicy chicken. Everyone is different and ramen is very subjective to what you like so try different ones! The service is usually fast, however they are always busy so patience may sometimes be required to be seated and to get more water, etc.
