Local Foods////I had the roast beef sandwich. I don't really eat roast beef but the other meat option was chicken with crunched up chips and nuts and pickles... gawd no. I had the soup of the day. I would have opted to try a brownie or something but looking at my total doing so would force me to take out a second mortgage. With tip I was at $22 for a roast beef sandwich and side of soup. This better be the best meal ever. It wasn't. It was a roast beef sand which, an expensive roast beef sandwich, end story. The soup was good, even the sunflower seeds in it.
