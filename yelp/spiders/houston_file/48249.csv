Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the flight of pancakes *( of your choice, that is) which consisted of the chocolate, blueberry, and sweet potatoes. The sweet potato pancake was to die for, being that I am sweets connoisseur, it didn't disappoint. I also ordered the snooze classic because I wanted to play it safe being my first time there, it is eggs, bacon, hash brown, and toast, your norm. The mimosas were pretty good as well, I chose the cranberry and orange.
