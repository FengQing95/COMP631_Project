JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonight was probably the first time in a while that we had excellent service . We usually sit in the main dining area but service has never been good . Tonight we sat at the bar for the first time and April took really good care of us . She makes the best lychee Moscow miles and took good care  of me , my fiancé , and my sister .
