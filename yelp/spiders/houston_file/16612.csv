JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen - This is the one vegan ramen I've tried that I fully endorse. I've always been too much of a wimp to order it myself (cause I'm afraid I'll miss out on the meat) but I don't hesitate to sneak spoonfuls of my friends' vegan broth...with a clean spoon, of course.
