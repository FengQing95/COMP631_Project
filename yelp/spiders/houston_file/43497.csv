Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Been to the common bond several times now. A tough review to write--the food is super, really nice, prepared and presented well, delicious. What is so fascinating is that everytime I've been, i've found the coffee to be mediocre at best--no matter if its drip, latte, or something else. Just not good flavor. As well, I've asked for fresh juice 2 times, (at breakfast), and both times I've been told they don't have any (or don't serve fresh squeezed or similar). Baffling for a place like this. Went for happy hour once, and the champagne drink on the menu then was also pretty bad--not cold at all, obviously was cheap champagne, and the drink overall wasn't good. Seating is tight which is cumbersome, tight. Overall, and odd experience. Great food, bad beverage service.
