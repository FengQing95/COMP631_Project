Local Foods////I decided to take the opportunity to try Local Foods since it fit the bill for a quick lunch spot in the area we were visiting. Neither of us had ever been to Rice Village, so it was surprising to see the density of eateries available. After 3 hours at the doctor's office we wanted no fussy lunch ordeals. Sandwiches made with fresh local ingredients at the time sounded more appealing than a whole lot of pomp and waiting elsewhere.
