JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jessica - Thank you for the awesome review. I'm glad you enjoy our ramen, especially its nurturing properties as you have pointed out! I will say there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that a hot bowl of ramen can "perk up" a slightly inebriated person (I won't say "sober up" because only time can do that). But thank you again for the kind words, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
