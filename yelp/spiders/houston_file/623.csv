JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was mediocre at best, the wait was long and the food is fairly pricy, and why would you put a bar at the front of a restaurant with a woman dressed in skimpy clothes? The ramen there is best described as: mehhh. There was nothing special about it and it was small, I had the combo with the ChaShu chicken and rice, that was fairly good but it won't help raise my rating. Would not go again not recommended.
