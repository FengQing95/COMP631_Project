Local Foods////Food was much better than I expected, but I guess it was a little too filling. Dinner for two was pretty satisfying but it seemed that the Asian Salad was a little too much. I ordered the Crunchy Chicken, and it was pretty decent, but nothing particularly spectacular. It was a tad bit expensive for the price but definitely decent food. Would recommend it to anyone in the area.
