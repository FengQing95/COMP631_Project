Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food took over an hour and it wasn't busy at all. Eggs were quite greasy. French toast was great but that was about it. Nothing taken off the bill for the excessive wait just kept saying it was be 5 more minutes, 10 more minutes, and some extra fruit brought to the table. Cute place hoping next time is a better experience.
