Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Crazy crazy crazy long wait but totally worth it. I did not takes pictures because I ate it so quickly. I got the breakfast burrito with bacon. It was amazing and huge. I took half home and it was still yummy later. I would get it again. Also I got the pancake flight with omg French toast (6 out of 10), sweet potatoes ( I actually took this one home because I couldn't eat it n it was good) cinnamon roll( best pancake ever)!! Fianc√© got pot pie n blueberry pancakes. He loved it. You should definitely go here if you want a good breakfast.
