JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When we walked in it was quite busy for being so late which was a good sign! The setting was very modern contemporary with low lighting which is perfect for the club to restaurant transition. Lol Very clean and inviting. Our server was on point. He knew that we were ready to eat. He suggested what items that were best sellers and for filled each of our cravings quickly!
