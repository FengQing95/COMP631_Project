Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lots of hype, little parking, and even less value. I've heard lots of good things but found it to be all hype.  I went on a Tuesday at 10:00 am and couldn't find parking. I pass the store daily at all different times. There is almost never parking available. Outrageous prices. I bought a small loaf of gingerbread (3"h x 3.5"w x 6"L, a single sugar covered donut pastry thing from the case $4.00, and an average sized panettone loaf. Neither the gingerbread nor the panettone were priced. I guess they assume people don't care about the price of things. I figured, how much could these simple baked bread products be.. I was quite shocked at the register when I was given a total of just under $65.00  I gave the Panettone as a gift, so never got to taste it. It was very pretty. Hope it tasted as good as it looked for the price. As for the gingerbread and pastry, they were very mediocre . Quite frankly, I've had better from the grocery store bakery. Seems to be just another trendy, overpriced mediocre place, taking itself way to seriously. And of course they have that annoying "suggested tip" on the screen at check out. Where do people get off suggesting what could have been a $13.00 tip to put 3 overpriced items into a bag??
