Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Speaking of my diatribe on the trendy-casual chain restaurant replicas (see review previous, on State Fare Kitchen), here comes an actual replica. Bosscat Kitchen is located in a trendy multi-development use complex in Highland Village, in a piece of real estate that looked like a carbon copy of the new and hip areas I stopped by in a summer visit to Atlanta. It's also location #2 for the brand. The first is in Newport Beach; how it made its way to Houston is unclear to me, nor really worth exploring.
