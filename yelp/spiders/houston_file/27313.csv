The Pit Room////Line was super long at 2pm on a Sunday BUT it went by quickly. Servings were a generous size; all the meats looked delicious! I was going to order 1 meat plate but wanted to try 2! Seating was a little difficult but simple for a party of 3. The turkey and sausage were great! Tasted my friends brisket and pulled pork and that was great as well! Macaroni and elote complimented the amazing taste. Will be returning!!
