Local Foods////The salad I got had so many flavors and was filling. My husband said that it's the best egg salad sandwich he's ever had. We also tried both vegan soups and they did not disappoint. The space is large and has both patio and indoor seating. I also thought it was cool that they sell speciality foods and drink to take home with you.
