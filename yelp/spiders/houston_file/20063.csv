Uchi////Bottom line at the top: a little overhyped, but still good, and the staff is wonderful except for a few of the hostesses. I would recommend delegating stomach space to the sashimi and dishes rather than sushi rolls. It ended up being a 3 hour ordeal so if you are pressed for time ask them to speed it up.
