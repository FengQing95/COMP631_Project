Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is the best HH spot around. Fun drinks. Delicious bites. Great deals! The aesthetic and attention to detail is immaculate. I love this place. Bre is my favorite server! Ask for her. She's so knowledgeable about Â the menu, and recommends beer like a champ. The owner John is so hospitable and made us feel like rockstars. Thank you, Bosscat! We will definitely be back.
