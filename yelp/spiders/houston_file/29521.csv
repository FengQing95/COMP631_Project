The Pit Room////I'm not a huge barbecue guy myself, but the brisket and beef rib from the Pit Room are tasty, and definitely satisfy my occasional craving for Texas barbecue at a fair price. The food is great and the staff are friendly, so this place does get pretty crowded around dinner time. It's a great place to get your barbecue fix and definitely one of the better places I've tried in town.
