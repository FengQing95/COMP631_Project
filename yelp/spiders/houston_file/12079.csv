JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I wasn't sure what to make of this place when my students picked it for lunch, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I don't think I've had Ramen other than in the little packages designed for starving college students... so this was quite an experience.  Kind of like Pho... but at the same time very different.  For less than $15 you get a nice size bowl of soup, noodles and meat. I went with the No.1. because I didn't know what to order.  I opted for some extra meat for another $1.50.  Turns out, it was pretty good.  I'm not rushing to go back, but I would be up for trying another bowl.  At lunch on Monday there was no wait, but finding parking was tricky due to all the people going to the 24 fitness.
