Uchi////overall, i was pretty delighted throughout the whole experience. the chef even came out of the kitchen to wish me happy birthday! We sat at the sushi bar, and Harold was our sushi chef. He was very attentive and brought out each dish one by one. Just as I was finishing up one dish, he would already have the next one ready! the presentation and quality were astounding; definitely a rare find in houston. This experience is one of the few times I've had Japanese food without drenching my sushi in soy sauce and wasabi. Each dish had unique ingredients to complement the fish. You could taste the fresh and nutty flavor from the fish, while appreciating the accompanying flavors that enhanced the natural fish flavor.
