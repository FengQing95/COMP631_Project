Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here 30 minutes before closing time and was worried that the service would be lacking. Thankfully I was completely wrong. Our server was attentive and provided great suggestions. This hit the spot tonight. We just came for drinks and appetizers, but everything was fresh and tasty. Would highly recommend. Can't wait to try it during daylight hours too!
