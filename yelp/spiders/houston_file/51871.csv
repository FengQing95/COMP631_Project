Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the pork belly Benedict which is pictured with an orange juice because the mimosas weren't available. I will tell you the presentation was great. The food was hot, fresh, and smelled immaculate. The American diner feel and the 80s/90s music playing had me thinking this was going to be all kinds of scrumptious. I was however a bit disappointed. The whole dish lacked flavor. The pork belly was crispy but it seemed unseasoned. I would say the same for the hash browns minus the crispy (which is probably due to the container that it is cooked in and how it's cooked). The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland as well.
