Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Met up with some friends here for a few drinks and a light lunch.  It's a very cool and hip spot.  The whiskey selection is top notch and some of the rarer stuff if reasonably priced for a bar.  The food selection is bar food with a twist.  What my wife and I ordered, chicken fried steak and totchos were good.  We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was fairly crowded.  We could have opted for a table, but we bellied up to the bar instead.  I imagine this place could get pretty crowded in the evenings and happy hour.  I'd come back.
