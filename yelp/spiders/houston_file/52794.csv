Kata Robata////I usually go to Kata Robata about 3-4 times per month.  I only go for lunch because it seems to be very crowded for dinner.  It has some of the freshest rolls in Houston.  By far the best thing on the lunch menu (in my opinion) is the Kobe Beef rice bowl.  The meat melts in your mouth and there is a perfect assortment of spice, veggies and of course it is topped with an egg yolk.  It is great.  I order it almost everytime.  Also the soup and salad is solid.  It is a bit pricey but for what I consider to be extremely fresh fish, it is worth it.
