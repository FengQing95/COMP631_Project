Baby Barnaby's////80% of the time I get the Breakfast Plate consisting of two eggs over medium, grits, biscuits, and bacon (which goes the Hubs because I can't eat meat). I tend to judge a place on its grits. Are they too runny? Are they tasting like they came from a box from Kroger? The grits here have never failed me. I love them. And the biscuits taste like they were baked in honey. Lord help me.
