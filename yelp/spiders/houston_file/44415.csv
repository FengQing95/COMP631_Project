Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for the food, its was decent at best. My meatball sandwich was favorable but the bread was a soggy mess within minutes. The potato chips are a greasy explosion in your mouth, i wanted to try them because they make them here but i didnt even eat half of them because they are so greasy! see pic...
