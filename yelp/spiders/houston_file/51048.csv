Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great tasting food but bad service. We'd been here before a couple times and didn't have a bad service until today. Place wasn't busy when we got there and all we wanted was a refill on our coffee. Our server Sonia was nowhere to be seen during most of our time there. And when she did pass by our table it's as if she went out of her way to not make eye contact and ignored us when we tried to get her attention.
