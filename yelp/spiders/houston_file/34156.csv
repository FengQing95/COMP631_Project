Local Foods////I ended up going with the crowd and getting the crunchy chicken sandwich.  The person at the counter was happy to tell me that it has won a ton of awards and that is their form of advertisement.  I think he even said it was mentioned in GQ.  Completely random, but the accolades are well deserved.  The pretzel bun is amazing.  This is one of those meals that I could see myself sharing.  The sandwich is just so filling that I'm amazed I finished it myself.
