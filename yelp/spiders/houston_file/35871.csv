Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is definitely my new spot! The drinks are out of this world, and the food is some of the best I've ever had!!! I tried the Barbecue Porchetta Sandwich, Pork Belly Poutine (added a fried egg on top) and Parmesan Crusted Meatloaf. The staff was extremely friendly and we even got greeted by the owner and general manager. Â It's not everyday that you see an owner running food and a general manager greeting folks as they're walking in. One of a class food, drinks, people and service!
