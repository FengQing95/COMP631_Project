The Pit Room////Went here on a Sunday evening with the family. Had the pork ribs and brisket. Both meats were solid. The sauce is good. The pricing is high even for tx BBQ. Wanted to have some turkey but they were out and the beef ribs were outrageously priced. They weigh the meat and round up for pricing. We asked for beef ribs and they weighed one which was about .8 of a lb. that was gonna set us back $22. No thanks. The sides were good but small portions. All in all the food is good. Not salt lick level but solid. The atmosphere, service and pricing is lacking to deserve more than 3 stars.
