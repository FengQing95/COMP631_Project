JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Atmosphere was nice and my review can only speak on the food I got which was the vegetarian ramen and the dry noodle bowl and it just wasn't good. Our shishito peppers where too salty and not very flavorful, my ramen lacked flavor and the dry noodle just tasted weird like spicy and slightly pungent. I would not recommend either. I can't even convince my partner to go back so we can try other things... Service was fine, the tables are small and a bit cramped. There is a large table in the middle for large parties i presume i am not sure if they take reservations. It's very easy to park in this area though there is a parking garage.
