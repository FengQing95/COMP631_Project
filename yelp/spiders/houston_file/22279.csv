Uchi////A group of friends and I came in August 7, we had chef tasting for 4( 1 per couple ). We reserved a table for 730 didn't get one till 8:30. Our server came and greeted us he, was super nice to my friend and I, so that helped me a little bit. The course came out one by one, not going to lie the first 3 was good. After that, sashimi came out? Very questionable for a tasting to have sashimi. But it was good so we over looked and kept eating. Then about the 6 dish, pop out a roll... there's 11 dishes in total, why would you put a roll in the middle. After that my girlfriend was kinda full already lol. And believe it or not the 7th dish is a curry ?!?!? Why would you put a curry in the middle of a sushi tasting. Tell me please, unless you don't put spices in your curry so it's not a real curry, who put curry in a tasting menu. And the curry wasn't even good, over floated with coconut water, the sweetness completely upset the balance of the curry. The fish in the curry were still so fishy (should have made it a little spicy) anyways, after the curry another plate of sashimi came out, okey seriously??? Are you guy just lazy that day so you're like oh wtf let just throw a bunch of stuff on the menu together and tell them it's chef special???? Really? 2 sashimi and a curry in a sushi tasting??? That's not the worst part believe me, then come the dish I was waiting for, the short ribs with apple butter yum right. Nope, our waiter said it was cook for 72 hours, in what? SALT?!?! Omg it's was Salty like literally as soon as the white thing on top ( I'm not sure what it's) was gone a burst of ocean water hit my palette. Honestly we payed for quantity not quality, I was very sad that you guy can call that a omkase. I was very much looking forward to eat at uchi. We got no Uni, the nigiri was not at all a variety, u guys drop us a plate of scallops and another plate of nigiri, the picture I took of the nigiri looked so sad. Please up your game :(
