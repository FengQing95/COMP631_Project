Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh MY Gosh ! This place was definitely the perfect brunch spot for manfriend & I. It really hit all the right places in flavor profile for me. The "Hot Brown" (12$) Â was served as an open face sandwich on sliced sourdough. Difficult to cut into but so delicious. I could've used more bacon, but it was the mornay & tomato that made it so perfect. The heaviness of the mornay was truly brighten by the tomato.
