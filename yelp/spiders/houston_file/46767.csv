Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My boyfriend and I tried this place in Denver and waited 2 hours for a table... It was totally worth it though and now that Snooze is in Houston we were so excited to try it out and see if it matches up to the original in Denver (it did!). Pancakes and Benedicts are the way to go at Snooze but honestly everything there is amazing . Our waiter was hilarious and the staff was so nice and made us smile the entire time we were there. Can't wait to eat there again soon!
