JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As a vegetarian, I was happy to see more than one vegetarian ramen option on the menu. I ordered the vegetarian soup ramen which tasted exactly how it sounds. The overall flavor was very mild and salty. I appreciated the fact that you can ask for mild, medium, or spicy levels. There is also chili sauce on the tables to flavor the ramen if you do not enjoy yours. Although I did not enjoy the ramen I chose, the vibe of JINYA was enjoyable. The lights were dim and the decoration was nice. I would advise, if going to this JINYA location, arrive very early especially at dinner time as there will be a wait and they do not do reservations.
