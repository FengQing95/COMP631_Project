Kata Robata////Great experience there for a lunch. This place was so popular and crowded so fortunately we made a reservation. Our top one dish was the lunch Kobe beef bowl, which was kinda like the Korean bibimbap. It was so flavorful and everything in it was just yummy and filling. Second fav was the aged beef skewers - they were very tender and juicy. Sashimi selection plate was just ok - I liked the Chu Toro and king salmon a la cart order better. But overall, nothing was bad, food it was in good portion and everything came in with reasonable prices. We were literally ordering a lot of dishes without hitting our bills too bad. Will come back!
