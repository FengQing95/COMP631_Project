Kata Robata////Came here last night. I loved the spicy variation of the pimms cup. It combined spicy and refreshing flavors to make for a truly amazing blend of flavors. The cocktail was the stand out to me, but I'm a sucker for pimms cups and loved their twist on a timeless classic. The sushi was also great with the presentation being the notable characteristic. Matt was a fantastic server and a funny guy. He did a great job regarding suggestions and just being a welcoming, pleasant host. Great food, great cocktails, great place. Will be back.
