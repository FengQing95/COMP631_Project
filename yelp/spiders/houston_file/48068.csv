Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Was looking for a cool place to take my friend for breakfast and mimosas on his birthday. He ordered the steak n eggs benny and asked for it to be cooked well done and the server said that they could not cook it well done that it only comes medium well. He ended up not even ordering anything because it was a simple request as to how he likes his steak cooked. Kinda sucks because I drove 20 minutes to get here and he didn't eat. The chai tea was good though! I'm sure the steak would have tasted good but they could have made the exception to make it right. I don't think an extra minute on the grill would've been a big deal.
