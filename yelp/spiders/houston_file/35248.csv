Local Foods////My ONLY complaint is that the booths are made from a weird vinyl that made it hard to slide in and out of the booth. They're comfortable to sit on, but difficult to scoot on. My sister and I both felt this way and I think the people before us had that problem too because they were sitting on the very edge of the seats. Not a big deal though. I'll be back!
