JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service was great, but the ramen was ok. The egg was over cook that the yolk was mostly chalky. The meat was fatty and they were small. The soup base wasn't flavorful or gave a good kick. It just taste like fatty and spicy seasoning. I do like the mint they have, overall it's a decent meal.
