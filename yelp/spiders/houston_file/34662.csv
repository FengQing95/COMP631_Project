Local Foods////Today was my first experience with Local Foods and let me tell you I had the worst experience trying to order food for pickup. I called around 11am to place my order and I got the message "phone number is not in order". I thought his was odd so I tried again several times over the course of 10 minutes. Turns out they shut their phone off during lunch time because it gets "crazy". Like whaaaaaat?!?
