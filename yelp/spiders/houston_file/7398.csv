JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really enjoy this place! Not even a big ramen fan but this place may have converted me. I don't like red meat so having a chicken broth option with chicken meat is such a plus for me. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and it was delicious. WARNING: DO NOT GET SPICY, get mild. I can take spicy food but wow the spicy was way too hot. The waitress said it was a slight kick but I do not agree. My lips def feel numb and it was so spicy the broth was undrinkable. Being the second level of spicy I thought it wouldn't be too bad. Not sure if my plate was bad or something...
