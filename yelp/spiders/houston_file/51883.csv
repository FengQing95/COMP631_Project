Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend and I came here for dine in for first time for her birthday and we had a great and safe time here! The tables were spaced out and all the waiters were wearing a mask. The service was quick and food were amazing! It is a great brunch restaurant and there is a patio area too so if people arent feeling safe to be inside to eat, they may eat outside. I got one of the benedict from the menu ( I dont remember the specific name) but it had the perfect combination of southern taste and the hash btown really hit the spot. If you are one of the person looking for something light, you may not like it but thos restaurant did had various of choices. And my friend got one of the cocktail and she said it was made well. The only thing is that the server never came around to refill my coffee and I wished that he had.
