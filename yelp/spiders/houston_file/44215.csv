Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////To start: the food. My friends and I shared everything, and I'm so glad we did because I was stuffed. The brunch menu had no weak links. The open faced sandwich with bacon, caramelized onions, and tomatoes was out of this world. I could have finished my friend's egg tartine for her if asked. It was very clear that a lot of thought went into the unique, authentic flavors that made the sandwiches.
