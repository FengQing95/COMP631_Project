Uchi////One major advice - DON'T order the clam dish with potato chips.  I don't remember what it was called, and it's no longer on the special menu.  Our server had recommended it, and it was AWFUL.  It had the fishiest taste to it, the sauce tasted like plain mayo with regular potato chips.  She saw that we barely touched it so she just took it off the menu.  She apologized for the bad suggestion...she had thought she'd "take a chance."  Why even take a chance on something so bad???
