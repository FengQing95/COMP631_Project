JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Dear Vlad, I'm sorry to hear of your experience at JINYA. Please know that this is unacceptable and that my general manager, Keith, has spoken to the server at length to determine how and why this happened. On a positive note, I greatly appreciate your kind words regarding our food. Should you consider visiting us again, and I hope that you do, please ask for me, Keith, Sara or Wynne (all of whom are floor managers), and they will make sure your experience matches the quality of our food.
