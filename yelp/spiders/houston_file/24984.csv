Uchi////Foie gras candy bar (2 candy bars) - this is an elevated and super elegant version of a snickers bar! Upon first bite you immediately taste the hazelnut, followed by the truffle caramel. That hint of truffle is so good! I honestly couldn't really taste the foie gras too much. I'll have to try it again. But nonetheless, great dessert!
