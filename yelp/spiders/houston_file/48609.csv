Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loveeeee this place! I would definitely return here. The upside down pineapple pancake was amazingggg. The blueberry danish was great as well. I wasn't a fan of their "OMG French toast" it was a bit salty from all the combinations of different fruits and syrups. Our waiter Kenny was an amazing person. He brought out a complimentary off the menu cinnamon roll pancake (they used to have it on their menu they should put it back!) it was to die for!! Soooo good! And the breakfast pot pie was good as well. The steak Benedict was good but I wasn't a big fan of the bread that was served under it. The texture was a bit off for me. Everything else was amazing!
