JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, very pleased with the experience.  We had to wait 20 minutes or so on a Thursday night at 10:00pm - so I can only imagine what the wait times are like during peak times or over the weekend.  As this place is extremely popular would recommend a weekday later visit.  Will be back to try the other Ramens!
