Kata Robata////If you can, ask for Chef Hori-san's signature dish.  It's FOIE GRAS (yes, I said foie gras) on seared scallop with a tiny bit of rice.  He can also make foie gras on seared yellowtail.  Okay, how do I explain this. I first took a bite of the yellowtail, and I literally said, omg, wow, this is amazing.  But wait....then I ate the foie gras with scallop and I DIED. Seriously, I DIE.  It was this buttery combination of goodness, a slight saltiness combined with the smooth creamy flavor of the scallop. Hands down my favorite dish of the night.
