Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wanted to try their famous almond and chocolate croissant, but sadly by the time I got there, they were sold out. So I went for the oatmeal pie and the choux. I really liked the oatmeal pie, which reminds me of my childhood. The oatmeal cookies were large and soft. The cream inside was creamy and not too sweet, which was perfect with the cookie. The choux was okay and I've had better. The cream is similar to whipped cream and the pastry was a little too dry for me.
