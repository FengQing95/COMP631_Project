Uchi////Nice, cozy place. The dishes could be less salty, but in general taste is good, with the creative use of ginger and yuzu. Also they may include less rice in the signature tasting. Actually I was a little disappointed to see many sushi but no sashimi. Dessert is my favorite, the fried milk is amazing!
