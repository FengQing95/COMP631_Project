Kata Robata////Food: We ordered the Texas Hamachi roll, Salmon & Soft Shell Crab roll, one order each of the toro and ika sashimi, and one order each of the amaebi, ebi, and hamachi + quail egg nigiri, finished off with Halo-Halo for dessert. All were excellent. I normally don't like cooked or fried things in my rolls but the fried shrimp (along with the fresh jalapeno slices) in the Texas Hamachi gave a good crunch. I wasn't terribly impressed with the Halo-Halo but it was an interesting take.
