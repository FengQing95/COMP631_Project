Baby Barnaby's////What a nice little "hidden gem"! I was headed to one of my favorite local restaurants and though bummed that my favorite place had plumbing issues and their kitchen was closed, I was so happy to stumble across Baby Barnaby's. In Houston for almost two years and It was always on my restaurant checklist and I'm sad to say that I discovered it when my time in the city was fading.
