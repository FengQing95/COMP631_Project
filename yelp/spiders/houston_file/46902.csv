Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our group of 4 came to visit Snooze on Sunday at 1pm. We expected parking to be crowded, and it was. It was almost impossible to even find street parking. The parking lot is very small. There were many open parking places that people weren't allowed to use "because those are bank parking" is what a staff member told us. The bank is closed on Sunday, yet they don't allow anyone to use those open spots, even though they are in the Snooze lot! Cars were pulling in, there's no outlet, so cars were having to turn around in a very tight spot creating total gridlock. We drove around an extra 15 minutes attempting to find street parking and finally found a spot about 6 blocks over.
