Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The kouign amann which I have previously described to a friend better than Dominique Ansel's tasted extremely dry and I felt like I had dust sedimenting in the roof of my mouth. The chocolate croissant no longer had that luxurious chocolate filling which was oozing out from the first bite. Instead what I received was a dried puff pastry shell that looked like it was drying out in the shelf for a couple of days. After biting into it, I got an oily texture in my mouth which was not in line with the greasiness of a regular croissant. After several bites, there was a miniscule ... rather a measly chocolate filling inside that tasted just ok.
