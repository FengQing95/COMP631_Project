The Pit Room////This might be the best spot in Houston. You can't come here and not get the brisket, it's literally the best brisket I've ever had. I flew into Houston on a business trip and this spot was recommended to me from some local co workers, wow were they spot on. Absolutely hands down 5 star food.
