The Pit Room////Wow, where to start. This was my first visit here based on a friends recommendation and I will be sure to make the same recommendations to other friends and family. The meat is so tasteful and soft, and potato salad is top notch, and bbq sauce so good, I couldn't drink it through a straw. Also, their staff is very friendly.
