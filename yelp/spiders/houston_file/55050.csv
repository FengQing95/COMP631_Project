Kata Robata////Compared to most other sushi places, this place is absolutely contemporary and extraordinary.  The service here is excellent and the food here is not traditional sushi or sashimi that I usually get.  You will need to have a different mind set and be prepared for new and exciting changes.  The sake selections here are great.  I can't use words to describe the food as they are delicious but as I said they are not traditional Japanese sushi.  You can check the pictures that I uploaded here to see what I meant.  Great place and I highly recommend it!
