Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Showed up at 12:00 on a Sunday and waited the full 1.5 hours as we were told. Once we received the text saying our table was ready, we were seated promptly and out waitress brought over and took our drink order. The coffee comes in a large curvy yellow mug and the cream is in a cute mini bucket.
