JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I remember the first location near Nasa was thoroughly delicious but this place lacked the most important ingredient when it comes to ramen...umani.  That earthy depth of flavor that's expected from any bowl of ramen.  The low point being the bamboo shoots and the high point being that marinated egg.  The one exception here is that the staff are fabulous, I just wish their ramen was just as good.
