Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for a friends birthday brunch! First of all the place looks neat and clean, nice ambience with a Dj! I ordered the pork belly tacos and the meatloaf hash. Both were very tasty! We also got to try the s'mores pancakes and fruity pebbles! I lovvve chocolate so I loved the marshmallows chocolate on a pancake. This restaurant has a room full of whisky! I ordered the orange blossom and it was lovely. I'm a fan of whisky so I ordered it a few times. Our servers were great as well. Thank you Terry for the exceptional customer service :) I will be coming again for brunch, and during weekdays to try your wings lol
