Local Foods////Tonight's dining experience I ordered the garden Sammie sandwich as a salad and it was off. First the server gave me goat cheese on the side with hummus but the guac spread was missing. So they may have mixed the almost spring harvest salad with the garden Sammie. You'd think I'd get the best of both worlds with both being my fav salads but it was terrible. The server was really confused when I asked him about the guac spread and he thought I ordered a garden salad.
