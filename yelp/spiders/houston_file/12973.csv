JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is me and my boyfriend's go to restaurant whenever we're in Houston, and I've driven from College Station and back in the same night just so we could have Jinya. Slightly ashamed to admit this, but I've had it for dinner and then been back the next day for lunch...but it's good food, ya know? No biggie.
