The Pit Room////One of the underplayed stars in the Pit show are the sides.  The okra (when it's not seasoned too heavily) is outstanding.  We love the beans and mac & cheese as well (mac can be mushy, but that's par for the course most places).  Don't forget to order the jalapeno sausage either, it can count as an appetizer for the daring.
