Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great food but a few things that could've gone better during our visit. Upon opening his silverware, my cousin discovered a used piece of gum holding the napkin together. I assumed it was simply taken from another table, however, this was gross to say the least. I bought to mimosa carafes at the bar and was charged a third upon getting my bill although we didn't order another. We also were charged for another table's items. We really could've made a bigger stink about this as the server didn't take any initiative in remediating these issues. Likely won't return as this is the second less than acceptable experience I've had here.
