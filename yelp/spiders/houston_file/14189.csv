JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Anthea - Thanks for your review. I believe we offer a premium product for a competitive price, especially given our location in Midtown where the price of goods and services are much higher than outside the Loop. I'm sorry some of your meal did not meet your full expectations. Please know that if you're ever dissatisfied with your meal for any reason, we will gladly remake your dish or suggest an alternative option. We appreciate your feedback very much.
