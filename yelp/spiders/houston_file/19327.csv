Uchi////Some of the most memorable selections were the oysters (which was on their weekly specials), avocado nigiri, and foie gras nigiri *mouth waters*.  Just a note, my husband and I are not ones for duck liver, but after we had the delicious piece of melting sushi, we HAD to ask what it was...and foie gras it was.
