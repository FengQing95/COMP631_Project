Baby Barnaby's////Best waffle I've had since moving to Houston! The fruit was so fresh and the syrup was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the pumpkin pancake and was in love with it as well. They even included a few little candy corns for a nice Halloween touch Â The orange juice is fresh squeezed right at the bar and was out of this world. Everything from the atmosphere, to the food, to the wait staff was 5 star comfort :-) A must visit!!!
