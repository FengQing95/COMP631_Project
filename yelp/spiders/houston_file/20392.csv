Uchi////I've been to Uchi twice. The first time was to decide if I wanted to celebrate my 20th birthday there and I had a great experience. Come my birthday we had a reservation for 7 pm and ended up waiting 30 minutes to be seated at a table. They told us the party at the table we had reserved was "finishing dessert", and ended up breaking the light bulb above the table. The table was then given to a different party that arrived after us. Then while deciding what to order we had a completely random waitress come and take all our menus and move them to the menu holder under the table, even as we told her we were still looking at them. Overall it was just a bad time.
