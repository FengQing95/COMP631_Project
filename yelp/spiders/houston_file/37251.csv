Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love craft cocktail bars so I was eager to try this place. I tried the Bosslady. It was a high priced $14 fruit juice. I was so disappointed. Â I'm used to my craft cocktails being $12+ but they are usually worth it. This cocktail was made with Wild Turkey and I couldn't even taste a hint of it. I decided to try a different drink. I tried the aged barrel whiskey ($16) and yet again I was disappointed. The drinks are weak and highly over priced; the value is not worth it!
