Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was packed and had quite a wait but a customer on the way out told me it's worth it. Boy was it. We got seated faster than our allotted wait time but got drinks at the bar. Delicious mimosas!! Best part was definitely Roni our waitress. Super bubbly and knowledgeable of the menu. She gave suggestions and input on what to get or add to the order. She also noticed we asked for hot sauce and brought like 5 different kinds. The food was delicious too, I'm still drooling over the French Toast. Definitely worth it and we'll be back!!
