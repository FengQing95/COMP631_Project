JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A Beautiful place located in the Midtown of Houston. The lighting gave me that intimate feeling of being on a date or having drinks with friends. I loved the yellow back light along the wall, it was like looking at a portrait of the rising sun. What I ordered was Pork Chashu Bowl, Brussels Sprouts Tempura, and Cha Cha Cha Ramen (off menu item). The PCB was great and not too salty. What impressed me the most was the BST, and it was exquisitely magnificent! The brussel sprouts were young and fresh, every bite tasted a little bitter with a little batter. I loved the fact that is contained less oil. The Cha Cha Cha composed of garlic, garlic, and more garlic with bean sprouts and Cha Shu. I'm a garlic star gazer so every bite was like a star falling from heaven. Also, the Cha Shu must have been slowly cooked overnight because everytime it sat on my tongue, it melted away! Coming from Los Angeles to Houston for vacation, Jinya didn't only meet but exceeded my expectation!
