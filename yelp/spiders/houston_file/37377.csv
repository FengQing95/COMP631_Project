Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A Whiskey bar? oh yeah.  While the drinks are quite strong yet amazing. endless selection of whiskeys, they even have Japanese whiskey. It was super packed on a Friday night, and the hostess messed up our number but we got seated within 1 hr. I guess this is typical for houston Friday night.  Nevertheless, the foods were a bit salty. the madeline were alright but the sweet/salty butter that comes with it was amazing. I also ordered the poutin, not my favorite. and my friend didnt like her frog leg. One of my friend ordered the burger and she said it was amazing.
