JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here late at night and it was still busy! The place is open till 2am on the weekends serving hot ramen. I got the tonkutsu spicy ramen with a seasoned egg added to it. The ramen had a bunch of flavors and just the right amount of spice. Ramen was topped off fresh onions, Woodward mushroom,and two slices of pork chashu
