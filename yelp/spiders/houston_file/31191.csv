Local Foods////Went here for lunch during the week. Staff was really nice and attentive and gave us recommendations. But we ended up getting different stuff. I had the pastrami sandwich and a cup of the avocado bisque. It was supposed to be served with with sauerkraut but I'm not a big fan of pickled cabbage (my German ancestors are ashamed). There was also a red sauce but I'm not really sure what it was but it added a bit of sweetness. Â Both salad and soup were really good. I'd go back - it was $12 for my meal. Not bad at all. Look forward to trying the other sides.
