JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There is no shortage of Asian restaurants in Houston. Today was a good day to try one of the many since we had some time to make a pass at one of them in Midtown Houston en route to Galveston to catch our cruise. We were the first customers at 10:58 AM on a Sunday and it opens at 11am every day.  In 20 minutes half the restaurant filled with Ramen-hungry customers like us.  And in 40 minutes, every seat in the House was taken.  The street construction was obviously not a deterrent; which tells me two things-Jinya brings in the Houston locals that live close and love eating here AND this place MUST serve really great food. True on both.
