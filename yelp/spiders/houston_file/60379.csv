Baby Barnaby's////Hmm, what can I say about Baby Barnaby's?  This place is amazing!  The food is fresh and tastes great!  I highly recommend the green eggs and the chicken apple sausage.  Come hungry, because the portion size is more than adequate and the prices are all very reasonable.  This is one of my favorite brunch spots mainly because I don't feel like I'm paying an arm and a leg for some fresh, simple, and delicious breakfast food!
