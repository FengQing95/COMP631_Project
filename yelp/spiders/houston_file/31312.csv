Local Foods////First time in Houston, the medial area, I searched for a restaurant with the best reviews and found the local foods.  It had the best reviews among all restaurants within 2 mile radius of the Hilton hotel.  I went for an early lunch and got the famous chicken sandwich with beets and cabbage slaw.
