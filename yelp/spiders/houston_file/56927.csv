Kata Robata////We got the spicy salmon and spider rolls from the happy hour menu, and then ordered the Kobe beef skewers, salmon sashimi, toro, uni, unagi, and green tea souffle cheesecake for dessert. The standouts were the Kobe beef skewers and green tea cheesecake. The Kobe beef is the result of a 72-hour sous vide, and MAN OH MAN you can tell. It's so uniquely melt-in-the-mouth and tender; it is truly memorable beef, I can say that for sure. The green tea cheesecake was Japanese-style, which absolutely complemented the green tea flavor. The cheesecake was accompanied by a lovely, omurice mold-shaped (but much smaller ha) scoop of red bean ice cream, which was SO perfect. Its soft, fragrant, gently sweet flavor married beautifully with the stronger green tea flavor of the pillowy squares of cheesecake. Ah, that was a great dessert. A good call.
