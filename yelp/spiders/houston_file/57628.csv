Kata Robata////Terrible customer service. I called ahead and I was told that no reservation was needed. I drove 45 min once I arrived at the restaurant with my husband and my 2 years old Â I was asked if I had a reservation I said no because I was told no need of reservation. Host told me that no need but the wait was 45 minutes. My son starting to cry because he was hungry so I decide to wait than I was told to wait outside in the cold because I couldn't wait inside.
