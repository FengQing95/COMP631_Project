Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As for the sweet potato pancakes, the dish was given in a portion of 2 pretty large pancakes, completely doused in a buttery warm caramel sauce and glazed pecans. The pancakes were actually extremely delicious, and cooked to a consistency that was a little gooey and underdone in a way that paired well with the rest of the components. However, I couldn't really eat more than half a pancake without feeling my blood sugar shoot through the roof, but shared among 3 people, it definitely made for a great addition to the brunch.
