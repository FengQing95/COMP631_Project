Baby Barnaby's////On weekends, Baby Barnaby's is usually pretty packed, and the small space has limited capacity. Don't be deterred, however, when you walk or drive up. Just part the Red Sea and get your name on the clipboard quickly, and wait on the patio until your name is called. Read your paper, sip the complimentary coffee they usually have set out, and enjoy the morning. It's well worth it.
