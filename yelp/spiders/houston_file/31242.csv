Local Foods////Two of the best sandwiches I have had since moving to Houston two years ago have been at at Local Foods.  Highly recommend the crunchy chicken or roast beef.  Vegan chili and homemade chips are great too.  Posole is a little too bland for me.  Do not let them make you a sandwich without asking for the pretzel bun!  Highly recommended!
