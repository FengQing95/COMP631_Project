Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute, trendy coffee shop well known for their baked goods. They also have meal plates as well for lunch. Their pastries are on the more $$ side, but they taste great. I particularly like their selections of breads. Their bread plate ($6) comes with several slices of different fresh baked breads with jam and whipped butter. (A great dish to share with friends.) Their chocolate croissants are baked perfectly. Their smoked duck opened face sandwich was really filling. The duck was tender and the spread was flavorful.
