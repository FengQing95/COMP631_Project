Uchi////I've been waiting a year to go here and the right occasion finally came up. It was worth the wait! First tip=get here before 6:30! The social hour prices are worth it. I'm glad we made early reservations. We got the famous Ham and Eggs roll. This was my favorite. Untraditional and savory and delicious. The crunchiness of the fried pork belly was amazing in combination with the roll. The shag roll was second based. Fried goodness again. Third was the Spicy tuna roll. This was good but not amazing. The yakitori shishito was part of the social hour. It was pretty good though I miss the traditional skewers. The famous Brussels sprouts were absolutely delicious. I will be getting these next time. Karaagge was next. Also very nice and crispy. We also had the Brie Ringo which was a nice combination of flavors. My favorite part of the experience was the dessert. I had to order the fried milk and it was heavenly. The best and last dish of the night was the peanut butter semifreddo. I was amazed that it tasted just like PB&J.
