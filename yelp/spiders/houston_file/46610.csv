Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food was good and employees were nice and helpful. It's a nice open space with windows, plenty of plug-ins, so making a good place to work with free Wi-Fi. They just opened up so it's pretty quiet right now and I like it like that. Only a few blocks from me and across from the park so it makes it a good breakfast date place also
