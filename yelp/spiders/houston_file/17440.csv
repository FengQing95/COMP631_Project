Uchi////I was in Houston for a meeting and dinner with clients and asked them to pick the restaurant.   They have been to Uchi a number of times and said that it was one of the best newer restaurants in Houston.  That was no exaggeration.  There were four of us - we had reservations for 6:30 pm on a Wednesday.  We showed up a few minutes late but we were immediately shown to our table.  The place was pretty crowded already and it got more so as the evening progressed.  In spite of the crowd, we didn't have much of a problem carrying on a conversation at our table.
