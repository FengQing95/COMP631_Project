Kata Robata////Came here a few times already and finally had time to review about it. One of the better sushi/sashimi places in Houston! Comparing them to MF and Uchi, it less pricey here and you still get great quality for the price. They have a heat selection of OTHER dinner items hot and cold besides sushi for the non sushi eaters! Great prices during happy hours.
