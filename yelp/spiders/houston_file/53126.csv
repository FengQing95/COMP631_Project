Kata Robata////Regardless, the food is quite delicious and the ingredients really shine in both freshness and in taste. The menu is mostly Japanese-inspired seafood dishes with an infusion of western ingredients/style such as sashimi w/ foie gras or edamame gazpacho, but the focus is primarily on seafood. They are also known for their sushi and sashimi being some of the freshest (with some cuts of fish coming from as far as Japan) in Houston.   When I visited I was able to try amber jack sashimi with foie gras, pan seared U-10 scallops, and a sushi plate. The amber jack and foie gras was simply divine, no literally, I thought I heard angels singing; the simple flavors of amber jack and the rich nuttiness of foie gras mingled so well that I had to stop and think about each bite. The pan seared scallops were lightly seared and cooked a little under done. The scallop had a firm texture but nice mild, sweet flavor and the sauce gave it more creamy, buttery appeal. The sushi was my least favorite but don't get me wrong it was good and better than some other sushi places but not my most favorite in Houston (Teppay being my Houston favorite). Overall, Kata Robata is a great Asian-fusion place to eat due to the food and environment especially for the young adult crowd. Prices range from $15-20 a plate.
