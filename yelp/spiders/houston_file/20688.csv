Uchi////Bacon Sen - Bacon Sen is a "taste" option which is a thick cut slice of pork belly, and a piece of green onion on a tiny bamboo skewer topped with fish caramel and bonito flakes.Call me a hillbilly all you want but this was no bacon, not even close. I don't understand why pork belly, THE CHEAPEST cut of pork is suddenly THE hit sensation at all these trendy spots. If you're gonna do pork belly, at least render down the fat some and crisp up the top skin to make it crispy and crunchy when you bite.
