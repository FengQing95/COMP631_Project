Local Foods////I gave this place 5 stars because I really like their food, but something really weird was going on this last time I went here.  To start off, the place was completely empty on a Sunday at 2pm. I'm not exaggerating, there literally wasn't another person in there besides me.  And it wasn't until I sat down to eat my food that I noticed something was off.  The table seemed different to me, darker and wooden, not at all what I'm used to at local.  And when my food came here it was arranged differently, and on a brightly colored paper plate, even though my fork was metal.. The whole meal seemed a little different to me.
