JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Go to Ramen Ichi and go to to Jinya and count how many Japanese customers are there. Japanese will go out of their way to a restaurant that is more authentic. While the owner may have good intentions, he should learn that operating a Japanese restaurant should teach you about being humble. I bet if JINYA was not in the downtown location they would just be skating by like Ramen Jin. You can appease the masses, and maybe that works for your business model. But do not disrespect the true ramen enthusiasts.
