Kata Robata////I am a foodie and there are very few restaurants that I go to over and over again, Kata is one of those. I also hate to admit I order the same thing each time. The crunchy eel roll is out of this world good, not soggy or squished just crunchy and yummy! I have tried some of their other items as bites off of other people's plates and they are great too, tuna tartar and their yellow fin with jalapenos, just plain yum!
