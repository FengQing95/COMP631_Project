Uchi////Over the last 2-3 years, though, Uchi Houston has started going down its own direction. They changed the sauce and components of the ham and eggs roll, the cereal (no longer cereal) that goes with the fried milk. It's not just menu items that come and go - I get it, that happens. It's not just the portions, which have been getting smaller. It's the fact that they KEPT iconic dishes on the menu but made tweaks that doesn't make culinary sense.
