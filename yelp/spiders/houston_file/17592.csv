Uchi////Finally made a point to check out Uchi. It's all everyone has been talking about. I took a chance with grabbing a seat at the bar with a girlfriend and only waited 10 minutes, but it was already 9PM. Ordered the cucumber cocktail and it was delicious. Jessica was our bartender and she was very well versed in the menu & very passionate. Unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of the suggestions. We ordered edamame...very clich√© for a sushi place, I know. It took them 30 minutes to get it out, and my first round of food came out before it did. Jessica informed that the menu was for sharing and to expect 3-5 pieces per order. So, to my surprise, when I got my first plate, I was surprised to see only one piece. It was off the daily specials menu, so apparently that page expect less food. Now I was starting to understand why this place was so pricy. My 1 piece was $10, and that was one of the less expensive items. My friend waited 45 minutes for her first dish, but I guess they thought we were sharing everything. All in all, I thought the place was a little over rated, but I had probably built it up in my head already to be this life changing experience. There was complementary valet and the service was good, as Jessica did offer Brussel sprouts on the house for the wait. I still think this is a MUST TRY, ONE TIME and you'll prob only come back if you have company in town.
