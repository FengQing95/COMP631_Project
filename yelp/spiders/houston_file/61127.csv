Baby Barnaby's////Since my first visit I have always ordered the green eggs! It doesn't seem like anything special, but it's just so tasty! The jack cheese mixed with the eggs, spinach and artichoke makes the eggs creamy. The chicken apple sausage isn't too salty, as sometimes it's too salty or smoky for my taste and it has the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the eggs.
