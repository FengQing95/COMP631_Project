JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Tonkotsu Black had a richer broth and a thinner noodle, so it was even better. We basically bullied my friend into making his meal a combo so we could try the pork chasu bowl. This is how we abuse our seniority. He got a ramen, salad, and a side bowl. Honestly, it's way too much food for one person. Our server advised us that the pork chasu was better than the chicken, which he finds bland. It reminded me of my mom's cooking, but needed more meat and sauce to pair with the large portion of rice.
