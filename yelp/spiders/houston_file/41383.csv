Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is a gem! Love the atmosphere!! Came here reading rave reviews of their croissants. Came here 2 days in fact, and each time the croissants were all sold out :( Ordered lemon tart, walnut brownie, cortado, raspberry coconut and vanilla macaron. It was good.
