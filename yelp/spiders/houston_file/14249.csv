JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We kicked the food party off with two appetizers. She insisted that we try the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura which I was completely open to. The shrimp are a great size and you get a shareable portion. Thanks to the tempura, the shrimp is just lightly battered and fried so it doesn't taste too heavy. The sauce they cover it in is delicious. My friend and I agreed that they could actually serve the tempura and sauce and it alone would be delectable! This is an appetizer I suggest you try.
