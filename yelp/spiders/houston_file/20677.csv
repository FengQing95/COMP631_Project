Uchi////Great sushi but not particularly traditional if that's what you're looking for. The idea is that you order many small plates to share (which are quite small). Overall, the food is very good but also very expensive, so consider that when you are going to eat. Also, they typically do not split checks, so be careful when planning to go in large groups.
