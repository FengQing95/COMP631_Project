JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is really good and have had a great time each time I've gone so far. The service isn't bad at all and the food comes out relatively fast. I usually get the original and have had it spicy as well. The ramen is pretty filing and very savory. I love the environment. It can be crowded, but if you're out with friends, it's a pretty good, casual place to go. If you've never visited before, the servers are really good at giving you tips on what to add, or how to change up the order to fit your tastes! If you're visiting Houston, I would recommend coming here at least once! If you've never had ramen before, you'd definitely want to visit here so you don't ruin your first experience.
