Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This cafe/bakery has a bright, clean, airy ambiance that feels quite European. Weather permitting, I prefer sitting outside during peak hours for a more peaceful vibe. It gets wildly crowded inside and feels overstimulating to me. However, the interior is beautiful and bright, natural light shines in during daylight hours.
