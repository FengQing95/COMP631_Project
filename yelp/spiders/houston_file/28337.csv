The Pit Room////This place is awesome! The food is incredible, from the meat, to the sides, to the homemade pickles. The portions are huge, so come hungry or plan to bring home leftovers. My only complaint is that the interior is very cramped and the seating is limited. The line to order started wrapping through the restaurant and blocking the door and walkways. Luckily the food is good enough that I didn't mind the crowd!
