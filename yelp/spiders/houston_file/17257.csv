JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first time trying ramen and im super impressed. This place is kind of small on the Inside and I did not appreciate the general tables in the middle where you can have a stranger sitting right now to you, especially during covid times. However, I did like the overall ambiance and aurora of the restaurant. I tried the spicy chicken ramen and if you're afraid of spicy food and still want to try it they can make a mild version of it. However, spicy was not too spicy and the broth was soo good, especially on a cold day. The food was a reasonable cost most of their ramen was around 15 dollars. I will definitely be coming back here! As well, if you always wanted a boiled egg in your ramen but you don't like it soft boiled they can make it hard boiled.
