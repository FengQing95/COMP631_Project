The Pit Room////Let's talk sides and sauces. Whoever was clever enough to come up with some of the flavor profiles in the types of sauces deserves a standing ovation. This being said the meats are great plain but I wanted to try them as they are all made in house. They have everything from a spices mustard to a mango habanero even a coffee BBQ sauce. Actually the BBQ sauce that comes with the plate is also amazing. Now the sides seem to be seasonal so get yourself down there to try the okra because it's one of the best I have had. Also the mac and cheese was delicious and cooked just right. It had a smokey flavor and the noodles are large and not overcooked.
