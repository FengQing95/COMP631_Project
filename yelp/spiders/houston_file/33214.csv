Local Foods////The crunchy chicken was delicious! Environment was nice and clean. They had pretty odd sides so I asked the cashier what she would recommend: tuscan kale and quinoa. I really liked the sandwich but the two sides she recommended was not for me. The quinoa was very unique. Filled with lentils, pomegranate, cauliflower, and I wasn't sure what else but I'm not a fan. I had 2 bites and that was it. The other side was pretty good. I usually don't like raisins but it made the kale a bit sweet. Overall, I would definitely go again and try different sides as well. We went on a Sunday at 12 and luckily missed the crowd by 5 mins.
