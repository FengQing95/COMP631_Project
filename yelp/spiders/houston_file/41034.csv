Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here with a friends for a birthday brunch. The establishment reminded me of a speakeasy with the bar centered in the middle of the restaurant and dark wood throughout. I had the shrimp and grits which was toMato forward but still a good choice. I really enjoyed the garlic bread that accompanied it. The server was nice and very attentive to our group. Overall I enjoyed my time there and can't wait to go back.
