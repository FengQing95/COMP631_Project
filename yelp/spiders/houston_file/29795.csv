The Pit Room////The mac was good and standard. The brisket was good with the barbecue sauce; it was perfect and not too dry.The pulled pork sandwich was also good. The buns of the sandwich were the best; they were sweet and made the sandwich even better. Â However the sauage jalepenos were alright, and the jalepenos in the sausage were lacking in flavor and had big chunks of jalepenos. The potato salad was also alright; tbh I feel like HEB potato salad is wayyy better. The elote didn't make that much of an impression on me, and I feel like elotes at the paleterias taste better at a cheaper price. Overall, it was alright.
