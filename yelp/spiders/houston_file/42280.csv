Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Our issues with this place - the fedoras are stupid and ugly and they need to stop. But that's not enough to take away a star. The star was taken away because the food wasn't up to the hype. I hate to be that way, but I wanted one of us to be blown away and we weren't.
