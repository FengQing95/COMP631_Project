Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So If you're just looking for a good place to drink, which they do specialize in, here's your new watering hole. But as for me, who doesn't drink liquor, I'm going for the food. I can drink beer anywhere. Don't short cut on the grub!!! So will I ever come back? First impression is a lasting impression. And I certainly left disappointed.
