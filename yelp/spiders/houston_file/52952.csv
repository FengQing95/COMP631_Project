Kata Robata////This part of the review isn't about the food because frankly I had difficulty enjoying it after the hostess.   There was a clear line of people waiting to be seated and another couple walked in and got in front of me,  skipping the line of 4 parties (restaurant was full so it's the order of the waiting list).  I asked that their name be moved to the end but the hosted that clearly saw this said "We just go by whoever talks to us first."  My gf and I stayed anyway but the other people were upset and left.  So that's at least a few people that probably won't come back.
