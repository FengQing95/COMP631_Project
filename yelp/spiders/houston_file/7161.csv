JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////If I could give Jinya a thousand stars I would! I love this place.. I have an obsession with the food.. I never had tasted authentic Japanese ramen before, I just heard about it through YouTubers in LA and it seemed like a trendy type of food and I was interested in trying it! So I stared searching for ramen places and I came across this gem.. I took my best friend and we were hooked on the first bite. My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen soup with corn and of course the seasoned egg... the egg is BOMB!!!! Everyone I have taken loves the place. The food is great! The service is great! The place is hip and cool close to downtown.. what more can you ask for? It's my guilty pleasure and although it's the only ramen place in Houston I've tried.. i don't need to experiment any further.. this will always be my go to!!! YOU MUST TRY IT TO SEE FOR YOURSELF! Promise you won't regret it.
