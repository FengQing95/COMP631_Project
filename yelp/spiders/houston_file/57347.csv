Kata Robata////This is one of my favorite places in Houston. We loved everything on the menu. Their ramen tastes just as good as it looks! We shared a big platter of sashimi and it was delicious. Fish was so fresh and the quality is one of the best we've had. I can't wait to take my sister in law when she comes to visit. Giving this place a big thumbs up!
