JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////LET ME TELL YOU. I was not originally a fan of ramen but honestly after having a bowl at Jinya, I am OBSESSED! I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Ramen - 11/10! I do not know what they put in that broth but I slurped that down so fast! The wontons were cooked to perfection, and the noodles were the perfect texture. It is not as creamy as the previous ramen I have had but that is not an issue! I am dying to return to try some more because I looked at other tables next to me and their bowls looked and smelled delicious! Wonderful service - service with a smile and such a sociable atmosphere! I am due to come back soon to try more of their delicious ramen! It may be pricey for broke college students but honestly, it was worth it to splurge!
