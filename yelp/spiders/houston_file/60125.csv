Baby Barnaby's////This time I had Apple pecan pancakes and although I've had better, they were still pretty good.My only complaint about the pancakes is that they were a little too thick for my liking... but hey, that's OK. I also had their delicious orange juice and found out that you actually get a refill on that microscopic glass! The only thing is that you have to ask for it! So, ask away! I also had a side order of their potatoes, and I just can't get enough of them!! Â My favorite dish is still the green eggs though! Service was good although they were super busy. I will continue to frequent Baby Barnaby's, they've become one of my favorite breakfast spots in Houston! =)
