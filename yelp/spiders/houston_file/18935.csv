Uchi////- Jar Jar Duck - as the most expensive dish on the menu, the jar jar duck was quite disappointing.  Sealed within a jar, the countryside farms duck is prepared two different ways--crispy and roasted--and paired with kumquat and endive and immersed in rosemary smoke.  The smoke penetrates the meat well, but gives it a smoky flavor that doesn't complement the flavor of the duck.
