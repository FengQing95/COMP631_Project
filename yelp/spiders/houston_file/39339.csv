Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Oh...I really wanted to like this. I really did. But their poutine was absolutely terrible. It had the smallest bits of met with potatoe wedges and flavorless globs of cheese. Oh the disappointment. And their okra had the oddest sickeningly sweet flavor. I had to cancel the remainder of the meals and leave to go to another restaurant. The service was good though and the wait was short.
