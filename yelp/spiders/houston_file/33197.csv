Local Foods////The service at Local Foods is impeccable and everyone is so knowledgeable about their products.. I truly love that because I am ALWAYS asking questions! Depending on the time you arrive parking can be a hassle but if you can't get into their lot there is tons of street parking available just be careful & pay attention to the signs, because there is nothing worse than walking out to your car on a "food high" and realizing 1.) your car is gone and 2.) your cell phone's dead. Lunch can be a bit cray but that is due to all the stuff I just mentioned, so the line can be out the door at times but it moves fairly quickly. Seating is first come first serve but more often than not, as you are ordering someone is leaving. (outdoor seating available as well.)
