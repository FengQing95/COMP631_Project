Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries though.. what can I say that hasn't already been said?! The seasonal fruit tarts are delicious! The crust is just right, never soggy. Fruit is fresh and not overly glazed with sugar or jam. I also really like their chocolate chip cookies..... nom nom nom. Have to control myself with those.
