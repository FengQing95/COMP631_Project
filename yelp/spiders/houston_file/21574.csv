Uchi////We loved our meal so much, we helped newcomers at the sushi bar plan their meal.  Some of the other items you must try are the walu walu (one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten), ham and eggs roll (pork belly in sushi form), and peanut butter semifreddo.  Though to be honest, I have never been disappointed with anything I've eaten here.  You can also try their happy hour from 5:00 - 6:30 pm that happens every day of the week.  It's a great deal but becomes packed so get there early.
