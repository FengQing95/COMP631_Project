Local Foods////Local Foods is the best place in Houston to get lighter, healthier, yet still very filling sandwiches. One of my favorite spots for lunch! I find myself always craving their Truffled Egg Salad sandwich or their Crunchy Chicken sandwich. They are suuuper generous on the portions! Basic sandwiches full of flavor. They also have a Smoked Salmon sandwich that is pretty tasty! (Their version of the "Lox.") Along with the sandwich, you pick two sides or a soup. I loooove their Chicken Posole!! Best chicken soup I've had from a restaurant. As for sides, I recommend the Soba Noodles and the Red Potato Salad or Fresh Fruit!
