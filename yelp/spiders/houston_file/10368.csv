JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Again, JINYA is a step in the right direction. There are definitely many kinks to iron out as they establish themselves, things like providing accurate wait time and NOT sitting a party of 6 in a single row when it's not the bar area. The price is on the higher end but as long as they can hold up their quality AND quantity, I'm ok with it.
