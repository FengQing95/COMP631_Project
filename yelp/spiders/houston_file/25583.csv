Uchi////6. konoko usuzukuri - This was an interesting mushroom dish made up flattened mushroom pieces dipped in a type of vinegar sauce. The flavors were very strong on this one. I wish this dish was a little bit warmer, but it tasted very cold like it came straight out of a fridge. The crisps that were on top were delicious
