Uchi////Uchi may fall somewhere in the middle of my travels + experiences of upscale Japanese establishments in the world. But for Houston, it is as top notch as one gets. Uchi's contemporary take on modern Japanese cuisine is second to none in a city where high-end cuisine has slowly become a mainstay in the food scene.
