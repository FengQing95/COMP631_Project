JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////"authentic" my ass. they charge you $1 for a poached egg like what??? my bowl of noodles costed $13 and the portion was the size of my fist. the waiters take forever to complete a simple task. It wasn't even peak hour and the waiter took 15 min to get our check after passing by our table twice. There are far more cheaper and better places within the area.
