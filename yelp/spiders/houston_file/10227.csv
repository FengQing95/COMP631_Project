JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After getting the spicy creamy vegan ramen here nothing else compares. It was our first trip and I added some toppings pretty nonchalantly but SO glad I did. I have never had bamboo shoots that tasted so fresh and tender in my life. Game changer for me. Can't wait for another trip.
