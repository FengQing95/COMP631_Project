The Pit Room////Okay.  So like most of us, we've all had BBQ.  I tried BBQ in Kansas City, St Louis, Austin, Dallas... and even the (famous or infamous) McRib at McD.  I have to say though, the best so far is The Pit Room in Houston.  This place was amazing. No fancy decors, no gimmicks, no branding, no frills.  Just simple good 'ol BBQ man!   We had seven people in our party and ordered Feast No 2.  The meat was incredible.  The pulled pork melted in our mouths, sausages were juicy (popped in your mouth), the ribs slid off the bones and the burnt ends were just right.  The sides were equally delicious.  So much so that we had to order seconds. [note: the serving size for the sides that come with the meals is somewhat small.].  I also went back and ordered their BBQ chicken.  (Yes, it was the same meal...)   Not surprisingly, the chicken was... amazing.   Beyond the pork, sausages, ribs, chicken and sides, they also have a good selection of beers and non-alcoholic beverages.  In sum, I highly recommend BBQ and meat lovers check out The Pit Room when in Houston.  But be warn, you will eat a lot.  Two people from our party decided to walk three miles back to their hotel after the feast, and one suffered from what he called "meat sweat" in the middle of the night....  (he's okay now).  My only criticism is their shirts cost $25 but I bought two anyway because the food was THAT good.  Enjoy!
