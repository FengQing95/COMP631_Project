Uchi////With respect to the food, some of it was quite good, while other dishes missed the mark for us. We started with some grilled edamame as an appetizer and it was pretty tasty and gave us something to do while we were waiting for the first course. However, things took a downward turn when that first course arrived - my wife was kind of frustrated because she is not a huge fan of spicy food and the first course was quite spicy (no warning!). That being said, the other dishes were not spicy in the least, so she forgave the restaurant eventually :) The other courses went up and down in terms of quality. I will say that the dessert with the fried milk was super delicious and the highlight of the meal for me. Unsurprisingly, dinner did take a long time because it consisted of 6 courses, and there were some pretty big gaps in between courses. So I wouldn't try that option out if you're in a hurry.
