JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For dessert, although stuffed like a teddy bear at this point, I ordered the annin tofu. It was an interesting dessert. The tofu base was nice and creamy and had a hint of almond. It was topped off with fresh fruit, whipped cream and a syrup (which the dessert have gone without).
