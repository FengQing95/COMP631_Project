Kata Robata////Update!  Now one of my go-to sushi places, in part because they open late!  They serve a pretty solid ramen here (soy sauce-based), but it did have a slightly overwhelming ginger flavor.  The Hamachi Kama (yellow tail collar) serving is larger than most places and usually done pretty well.  Miso Lobster Mac & Cheese is very good; good amount of lobster and the panko crust really adds to the flavor.  Would also recommend the miso marinated black cod -  great fish and slightly sweetened with the miso glaze.  Pan seared Chilean sea bass is amazing... but this dish takes awhile to cook, so don't order it if you're short on time!
