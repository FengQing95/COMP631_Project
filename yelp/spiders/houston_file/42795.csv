Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The allure of a big, gooey, sticky, heavy pastry has Â always just seemed off. Don't you feel terrible after eating that? Doesn't the number of completely empty calories ick you out? And why does it cost $8?? For $8, I can have a whole huge steaming bowl of vietnamese soup, or a hefty plate of Indian food, or so many (!) tacos. But $8 for some sugar and butter? ($8 is a bit of an exaggeration - only just a bit, but in the interest of full disclosure, I believe my actual pastry was $5)
