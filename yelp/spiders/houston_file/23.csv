Local Foods////I have been to Local Foods on 5 or 6 occasions now, and I am HOOKED! At this point, I've had the egg truffle sandwich, the shrimp/crab sandwich, the Asian chicken salad, and the smoked salmon, and all are delicious. The concept behind the restaurant - local foods grown and raised in a humane environment - is extremely important to me, and I've long wished for a restaurant with that concept in mind in Houston. Local Foods is it! The food has always been great, service has been fast, the ambiance is nice . . . I love it!
