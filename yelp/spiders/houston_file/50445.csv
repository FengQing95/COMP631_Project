Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the omelet with tomato, feta, and spinach with a side of their FANTASTIC bacon, and an english muffin, hash browns, and their OMG French Toast. Everything came out in a timely manner and was hot & delicious. The omelet was SO GOOD. You get so much food for the price. I loved their OMG French Toast - packed with flavor and the bread was just the right amount of 'toasty.'
