Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I sadly did not take any pics of my food here because I literally jumped in with no apprehensions and got up with no regrets. I loved this place. I got the OMG! Frensch Toast with a side of eggs. That was months ago and I can still smell it. I just haven't been able to make my way back there. I would recommend everyone to go here at least twice, haha, both natives and visitors. Kudos Snooze, you made this foodie food lover's list!
