Local Foods////Food: I Â know the crunchy chicken is a favorite... and I love it too, but I've been hooked on the garden sammie ever since I've tried it. It's loaded with roasted veggies. The sandwiches are fantastic, but I'm alos a huge fan of the sides. I've had the slaw, kale, and homemade chips... all are delicious. The combination of flavors is just perfect! Another favorite of mine is the Asian Chicken salad. The portions are generous, but if I split with someone or save some extra room, I like to spurge with the chocolate cupcake. It reminds me of a good ol' homemade chocolate cake my mom and grandma used to make.
