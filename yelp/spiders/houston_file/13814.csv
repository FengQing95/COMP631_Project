JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the spicy vegan ramen.  It has a creamy broth, and loading with green onions, white onions, tofu, and some other green stuff.  The broth was flavorful and satisfying, but I didn't think it was spicy enough to be labeled spicy.  I also wish there had been more garlic chips-- didn't get much garlic flavor.  But it was pretty good for vegan ramen!
