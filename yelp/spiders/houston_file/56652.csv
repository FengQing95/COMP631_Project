Kata Robata////I can't believe I've never reviewed Kata Robata, my family's main sushi destination. So, the sushi here is very good, but that's not really why it gets five stars from me. It's the consistency (Kata's stuff is *always* good) and the service (always well trained and efficient). The highs here aren't the same as elsewhere - see my review of a recent omakase in New York for examples - but I've also never had anything bad.
