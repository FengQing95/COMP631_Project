Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Chocolate Eclair- If you've made it to this point, understand that I went too far. Learn that anymore than four items for a single person is a practice into gluttony. But I couldn't stop. I would finish them all. Tell my family that these desserts were beautiful and to give my YuGiOh cards to the next generation.This chocolate eclair was giving me flashbacks to the mudslide cookie I ate earlier and reminded my body that just prior to arrival, I had just finished working out and drank a protein shake. The top chocolate is smooth and thick, covering the small eclair and an even smaller strip of more chocolate inside. Once again, only get if you are prepared for a strong taste of chocolate. I was a fool to get this far, but regardless of my weakness to chocolate, I had a nice chuckle. Giggle points 5/10
