Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great drinks and good service. Another persons review stating that the food is just ok food is right on. I just didn't think it was stellar. For example  pork sandwich where pork was overcooked. Roasted veggies and fries that were so salty it seemed like the lid had come off the salad shaker. Huge seating area with only about  a handful of comfortable seats which were already reserved. I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come here again. It seems like a good place for after work drrinks with a big group.
