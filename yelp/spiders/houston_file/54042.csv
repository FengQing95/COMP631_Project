Kata Robata////There have been many comparisons between Kata and Uchi, and it seems to me those reviews miss the point.   The food is excellent at both places, but the ambience is almost opposite.   Uchi is quiet and relaxing, quiet enough that the waitstaff and serving assistants calmly explain each dish as it comes out to you, and work with you to help make the right selections.   It is a great place to go if you actually want to talk to your date.
