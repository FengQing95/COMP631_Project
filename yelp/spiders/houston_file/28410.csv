The Pit Room////We have been to the pit room countless times...The pit room is very good bbq. You must get the chicken taco. The brisket and pulled pork is great too. We have gotten the sugar pie a couple times but it's nothing too special. The atmosphere is great and you can take your food over to the bar which is owned by the same people.
