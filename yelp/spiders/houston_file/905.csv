JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry your were disappointed by our seating policy.  Having been in he restaurant industry for over 25 years and owning everything from small ice cream shops to 10,000 sq feet full service dining establishments, I can honestly tell you there is no perfect system when it comes to seating.  Jinya Midtown is a very busy establishment and we must adhere to the policies implemented by our franchisor in order to maintain consistency not only for you, but to all guests.  Whether it's a group of 2 or 20, we have to respect everyone's time and consideration when seating. That being said, I understand not everyone enjoy the communal table setup and the option is always there for you to request another table should there be one open.  Being that it was your first visit, I can understand it may be an uncomfortable setting as you may not be used to our communal dining setup.  The Japanese ramen culture of communal seating was something our founder wanted our diners to experience.  However, when requested, we are always willing to accommodate to a different table whenever we can.  We serve over 1000 customers inside an area of less than 2000 sq feet each day and we do the best we can to seat each and every customer on a timely basis.   I am sorry your experience was not what you expected.  Should you return, please ask for me as I will do my very best to meet your expectations.  Happy Holidays to you and your family.
