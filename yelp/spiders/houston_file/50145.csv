Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Admittedly, if we had not gotten great feedback about this place, we would NOT have agreed to the Â crazy long wait. We were told it would be 60-90 minute wait. But, we would be given a heads up via text when our table was ready -- with 7 minutes to check in after being notified. At least this way, we could go off and roam the neighborhood, have coffee, and visit with each other. That's exactly what we did.
