Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only negatives I can report is that they are almost always packed to the brim. The other and perhaps more concerning is thT I have yet to get a proper cappuccino (looking more like a latte- heavy on the milk with no foam), which does make me very sad and thus the reason I would dock them half a star if I could. But, you know what makes up for that? The almond croissant. Nuff said.
