Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lessons learned from my experience at Common Bond this morning: Do not park illegally. Â Even if someone else is parked illegally on the other side of the row. Even if you think you're going to be in there for 5 minutes tops to grab coffee and maybe a baked good on your way to work. Do not under any circumstances accept the offer to have the bialy toasted. It will take a long time. 25 minutes for a toasted bialy is too long. Your car will be towed if you're parked illegally for 25 minutes. It will be entirely your fault, you parked illegally - and you stopped paying attention to your car because you were fixated on what was taking so long to toast a bialy. $86.25 for a cup of coffee, toasted bialy and to not have the car impounded is too much. Probably won't be back. The bialy was not worth it.
