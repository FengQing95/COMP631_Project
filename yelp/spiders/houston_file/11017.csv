JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I recently moved back to Texas from DC and I've had amazing ramen. I've been craving ramen for some time now and I haven't had a place to come close to DC. The food was really good. I asked the waiter to recommend something and he did. While it wasn't spicy, it was very tasty. My waiter was amazing and the atmosphere is very inviting. I have no complaints and I plan on returning.
