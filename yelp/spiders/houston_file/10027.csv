JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cha Cha Cha Ramen: This is supposed to be a garlic lover with tonkotsu based. Quite good, but it needs one more push for Umami, so by adding a small amount of Ramen flavor sauce and hot sauce with extra green onion, you get a high quality ramen. The noodle is the thick one, but unfortunately the broth is not thick enough to stick to the ramen noodle. But, I still give this ramen a high remark for an overall great balance. It is worth a try and I will love to taste again.
