Uchi////As a birthday treat, they brought us a complimentary dessert- the fried milk that I noticed everybody raving about on Yelp.  I completely understand why though, because it was incredible.  Hot, creamy, rich, and unlike anything I've ever had before.  At this point we were both stuffed, but basking in our respective food comas.  Eating a meal at Uchi is more than just eating a meal- it's an entire dining experience that starts when you walk in the door.  Save it for special occasions and go hungry!
