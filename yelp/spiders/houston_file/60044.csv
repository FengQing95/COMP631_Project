Baby Barnaby's////I got the breakfast platter - My eggs over easy were cooked perfectly and the potatoes and bacon were great. My boyfriend and I split French toast and that was awesome too. He told me they also have incredible fresh squeezed juices, however I didn't get to try the OJ because a juicer temporarily broke. But I'll definitely be back again to try it :)
