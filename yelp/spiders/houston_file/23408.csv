Uchi////I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised with this beautiful sushi bar! I have been to a number of sushi bars and this restaurant knows how to do it. We were immediately greeted by out hostess next door while waiting on our table at Southside. We had a wonderful and attentive waiter which explained any and all concerns and questions we had. Th service was outstanding and the manager came by just to come and chat with us. The food was absolutely outstanding but the service definitely sealed the deal. The ambience and layout of the restaurant was wonderful and I will have to say this is the place to experience a wonderful evening!
