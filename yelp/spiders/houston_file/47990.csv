Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Perfect way to start your day!  I had the Classic w/jalapeño in the eggs and Chicken sausage. The house coffee is proprietary and it is excellent. For grins I tried the Bangkok Bloody Mary.  If you like spicy (which I do) you'll love this one.  The server was fast and friendly with great recommendations. Atmosphere is bright and fun!  Loved it.
