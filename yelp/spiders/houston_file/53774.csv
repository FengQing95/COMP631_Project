Kata Robata////This is by far my absolute favorite sushi place! I think it's equal to Uchi Houston. It's a perfect date night location to spend with your loved one. I've been here twice and both times I have had the sashimi platter for two where you get approximately 8 different kinds of fish and 4-5 pieces per fish. It's $60 and it's definitely worth it if you're into raw fish. I like to order a side of sushi rice with it that way it balances out all the "fishness". Anyway, their sushi rolls are delicious. I have had the happy hour rolls and the non happy hour rolls. I can't say which one is my favorite because they're all pretty good. I'm a sushi fanatic so this place really blew my mind! It is more of an upscale restaurant so be prepared to blow a lot of money. But I think it's perfectly priced for the taste. I've had cheaper sushi that was delicious but I seriously haven't tasted any sushi places better than Kata Robata. The service is just as good as the food as well which is double kudos!! Love this place. I will be back :-)
