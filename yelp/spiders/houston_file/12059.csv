JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Having visited the place at 10-11pm-ish, I was still a bit shocked to see that we needed to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated. With a relatively intimate and close seating arrangement, I felt like a bit awkward sitting in such near proximity to someone else. A bit more on the ambiance, it's a bit uncomfortable to have a really dimly lit seating arrangement clash with such a loud dining area [sort of like the whole debate between Eastern and Western dining cultures].
