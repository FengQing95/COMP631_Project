JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered one of the new items from their menu, the Tangy Shrimp Cilantro, which had a thick and savory broth, thin noodles, fried shrimp, and topped with a generous amount of cilantro. I added on an egg because...if I'm going to a ramen place part of my judgement of whether it's a good ramen place is if their runny egg is good. (At Jinya, it so was btw.) Definitely an unconventional ramen choice but so so good.
