Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////And the kouign amann. Oh man I cannot stress enough the importance of getting this sweet treat into your mouth as soon as you possibly can. It's basically like a denser croissant with a crunchy sugar coating over it-- what more could you possibly want from life? I'm not as big of a fan of the kugelhopf, which is more cakey and citrusy. Don't get confused between these two like I do. Their only similarity is that they're both hard to pronounce.
