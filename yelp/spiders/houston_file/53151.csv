Kata Robata////My wife and I had dinner here tonight...we saw the reviews here and thought we would give it a try...we were impressed...not only with the meal but also the waitress Mary...since this was our first visit to this restaurant, we asked for some suggestions...OMG...the Hamachi & Jalapeños  Sashimi, Kobe beef kabobs and a couple of other items were outstanding...Mary gave great suggestions and service...we will go again
