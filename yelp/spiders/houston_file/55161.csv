Kata Robata////As my main meal I got the spicy soy ramen along with the tiger eye roll. The ramen came with ground pork, which I didn't mind since it avoided the gelatinous fatty part usually found in ramen. The broth which is normally what separates a decent ramen from an amazing one definitely delivered. The downside was that the noodles obviously were not hand made like in Japan. I have contented myself with never finding the same quality as Japan, but this was some of the best ramen I have found in North America.
