Uchi////- Wagyu Beef Special - sublime. Paired with marinated strawberries and foie gras gastrique, the wagyu special was a symphony of flavors that resonated with my soul.  The tenderness and deep beef flavor lulls your tongue into a sense of indescribable happiness.  It was so tender that my chopsticks inadvertently sliced the beef in half as I tried to pick it up.
