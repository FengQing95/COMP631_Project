JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Margaret - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry to hear you received a ramen bowl that was not at an ideal temperature. I always like to emphasize that if you receive any item from us that you're not 100% satisfied with, we will happily remake it for you as quickly as possible. And despite your feeling "underwhelmed" with most of our ramen dishes, it's a fair a critique, and I can only say that our corporate headquarters are constantly coming up with new menu items with the aim of keeping our menu fresh, new, innovative and creative. That is our goal. Thanks again.
