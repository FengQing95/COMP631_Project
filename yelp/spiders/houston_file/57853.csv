Kata Robata////I must say this place is fancy , pricey (but it's worth every penny), bathrooms have the Japanese toilets which is an experience LOL!but getting into the food ,house made lemonade, Kobe beef skewers wide selection of sushi (I will highly recommend yellow tail and Toro.), great rolls as Texas Hamachi and the ocean picante. This is hands down top rated sushi restaurant in Houston in my book :)
