JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////All of our ramen chefs are required to wear health-code sanctioned caps, and our prep staff also wear hairnets. Our servers are also required to keep their hair pulled back, as well. As you mentioned at the top of our review, we are a high-volume restaurant. We serve several hundred bowls of ramen for lunch and dinner. We try as hard as humanly possible to make sure every bowl comes out correct and made-to-order. And if we ever make a mistake -- or if a hair ever ends up in the bowl -- we are happy to remake the dish, offer an alternative, or take the item off your tab. Our essential goal is for every customer to leave our house satisfied and happy.
