Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Overall a nice spot. I wish the restaurant had more seating because the food is so beautiful and wonderful, and the space is lovely. Take out is a good option to try and enjoy without pressuring other folks to leave their table or add to the already very crowded space. Drinks and pastries as well as sandwiches are delicious. Plan for street parking or walk if close because the lot is always full.
