Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I live walking distance so I've been dozens of times over the years. The baked items are amazing obviously and the coffee very rich. The chocolate cookie is my favorite out of everything even though nothing is bad. Some of the food can be on the heavy side, but overall I do really enjoy the dinner options. The wine prices are some of the best anywhere. They serve my favorite sauvignon blanc. Â I think the only way this place could be better is if they served ice cream! But, I know it's a bakery so that won't happen. I cannot imagine anyone not liking their baked good. The pistachio croissant is my other favorite.
