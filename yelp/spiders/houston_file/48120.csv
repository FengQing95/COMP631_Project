Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went here for my birthday and didn't have too long of a wait.  There were some board games and bean bag toss outside while we waited (not sure if it's always available).  Service was decent.  I tried the breakfast pot pie which was really good but not mind blowing.  My friends got the pancakes, and enjoyed them (but again, nothing outstanding).  The waitress recommended the mocha coffee, and to me, that was the only thing that I would definitely come back for!  That was one of the best cups of joe I've had in ages!  Snooze is nice, but I don't think it's worth any long wait for.
