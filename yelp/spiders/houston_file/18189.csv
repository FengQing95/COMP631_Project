Uchi////Uchi is not just about the sushi, but the knowledgeable chefs and great service.  It is an experience that you will definitely pay for, but worth it for the occasional treat (unless you are lucky enough to not have to worry about money).  I sat at the sushi bar so the chef was my "waiter".  I basically surrendered my menu and let him give me his top picks and I was not disappointed.  Everything was amazing and fresh.  I recommend.
