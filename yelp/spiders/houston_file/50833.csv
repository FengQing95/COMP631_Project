Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been to this place several times and I'm never disappointed when I go. My favorite thing to order is the OMG french toast with a side of bacon. The French toast is always cooked to perfection and so is the bacon. I typically order the Snooze hot cocoa or their mocha to drink. Both taste amazing to me. The hot cocoa probably is my favorite with the whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkled on top and chocolate sauce drizzled on the inside of the cup. You can't go wrong with that!
