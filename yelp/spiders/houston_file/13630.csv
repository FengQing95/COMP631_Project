JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I regret that this happened and regret that our staff spoke to you in a rude manner. I have worked with my crew for quite some time, and I am hoping that this was a momentary lapse of judgment. If you peruse our many Yelp reviews, you'll find that rude behavior by our staff is not tolerated whatsoever. And we take pride in good service.
