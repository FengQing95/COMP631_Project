Kata Robata////Sunday early dinner at 5pm, first time ever going to Kata Robata.  After previewing the menu and prior reviews on yelp my expectations for a fancier version of the more and more common japanese grill.  However, upon trying the first bite of the first appetizer - all the way to the last bite of our dessert - it was clear that we had come to an extremely good and very underrated restaurant.  It was quite possibly the best bang for buck food I have ever had, and I say that as someone who generally believes ritzy, high-priced menus are only described by others as wonderful because of the expectation placed by the high prices.  Kata Robata's dishes were flavorful, creative, elegant and perfectly portioned.  For example, the much-raved Lobster Mac N' Cheese is $19 - and for that we received a dish that three people could enjoy a good amount of, but without that overwhelming greasy / fatty feeling you can easily get when combining rich cheeses and succulent lobster.  I intend to go back very soon and try other dishes, but here are the dishes our group of three ordered along with our thoughts:
