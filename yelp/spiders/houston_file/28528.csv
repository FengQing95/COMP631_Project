The Pit Room////Houston is definitely about the "Q" and the Pit Room certainly holds its own. No frills, but excellent tender brisket, fall off the bone ribs, smokey turkey and sides that compliment the star of the show graciously. Ice cold drinks packed in ice and a great variety of condiments. Service with a smile and seating available inside and out. Worth the "Pit" stop.
