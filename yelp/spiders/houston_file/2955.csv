JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been here a number of times and I like this place a lot. I've had the Ramen and some of the appetizers (Takoyaki and shrimp toast) and nothing disappointed. Â I've tried a number of the broth and my favorite is the spicy chicken because it is a bit lighter. All of the food is reasonably priced, the ambiance is great, and I like that you can add in whatever you want to your Ramen :)
