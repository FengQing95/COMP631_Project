Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now for the cons - ordering can get a little annoying, with one person following you all the way down the line. The plates are long if you order multiple pastries on the same ticket and it can be awkward to share. The size of the restaurant and parking lot can make it difficult for parties over 4 people to dine together, especially at lunch. But, overall, Common Bond is one of my favorite places and I will continue to go in for almond croissants and much more as often as I can find a parking spot.
