Uchi////Wow AND WOW!  Visited Uchi to celebrate our daughter's college graduation.  From our first step into the restaurant I was impressed!  We arrived a bit early for our reservation so we were told to visit the bar.  The bar is filled with people eating at it, so that's a bit awkward.  We waited on the outdoor patio.  A server came and took a drink order.  She was so kind and helpful, patient...even though the patio was PACKED!  When our table was ready she helped carry our drinks inside.  Our server brought the menus and explained it a bit.  He asked if we were celebrating and we told him about the graduation.  We ordered from several different parts of the menu and left some choices up to him.  Everything was absolutely to die for!!  Fantastic.  Our server timed our meal perfectly.  We were never rushed and enjoyed the pace.  He even brought two dishes for our graduate - on the house.  We were all very impressed with the staff and the food.  Excellent!
