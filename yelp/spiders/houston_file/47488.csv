Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Heard a lot about this place. Waited almost an hour and a half for breakfast food that was just on par with other decent/good breakfast places, nothing special. My partner's tofu scramble was poorly seasoned and made us regret waiting so long. Would probably be a 4 Star if the wait wasn't so long and if they got their tofu act together.
