Baby Barnaby's////I got my hot chocolate a little late, but I used my spoon to drink it spoon full by spoon full savoring every sip.  My buddy looked at me and said "you look like an orphan boy who gets hot chocolate once a year."  Looking at him...  I kept sipping feeling the warm soft chocolatly liquid on my tongue... Yeah, this place is in running for the best breakfast in Houston just like the picture I posted said...
