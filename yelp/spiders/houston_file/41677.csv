Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The kouign-amann is literally the best thing on earth don't let the name intimidate you, you must get this pastry it's all that a croissant is with a sticky gooey sugar bottom that will give your life new meaning. The croissants are the best in houston and the crusty sour dough and baguettes are all the rage. Everything behind the glass is a win in my book, you cannot go wrong. My only issue here is I can't seem to find a main dish I like. I mean, I don't eat beef or pork so my options are limited but the duck tartine was inedible with the amount of smoke they poured onto the dish and the pumpernickel bread was not working at all. I have had all the dishes that I can eat and all fall short of expectation. They did have a dish when they first opened that I loved so much... it had wild mushrooms and a poached egg on either polenta or grits. It was so good and I wish they would bring it back.
