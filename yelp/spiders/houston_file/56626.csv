Kata Robata////The waiter was generally MIA. We also waited 15 mins after giving him a credit card. When he came back, a cold "sorry for the wait", dumped the bill on the table and walked off! We also heard him flippantly making excuses to a nearby table about having a busy section. Kind of ruined our anniversary dinner. And there was no manager in sight to complain to.
