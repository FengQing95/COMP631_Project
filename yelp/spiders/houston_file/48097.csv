Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The line is long but it's worth the wait. I came with a group of friends and they all enjoyed. I tried the pie apple upside down pancake and it was amazing! I wish I would've had two. Service was prompt and attentive, which is great because they were very busy. I may be a Snooze regular when I visit Houston.
