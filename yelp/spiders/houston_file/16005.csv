JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall the food flavor is good, quite good, just not quite the punch I am looking for in Ramen though.I felt like the depth just wasn't quite there.  I like a deeply rich broth, opaque, cloudy, collagen bubbles on the surface just a deeply tasty tonkatsu and this wasn't quite it.  Still really good.  What killed it for me were the noodles, they just didn't have enough substance.  They were far too thin.  I do like that you can get a refill on the noodles if you want, that's great.
