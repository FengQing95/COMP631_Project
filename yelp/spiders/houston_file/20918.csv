Uchi////A note: we actually got six of the above dishes as part of a six course tasting menu, which is priced the same as just ordering the dishes a la carte.  (Kind of like in-n-out meal pricing. :) )  But it saves you "some" of the effort of ordering from such a big menu.  Having said that, our waiter Mike was a HUGE friendly knowledgeable help in ordering.  And in hug transmitting.  Thanks Mike!
