The Pit Room////Came here because it had great reviews, but super sorry we wasted $100 in this restaurant. Had the brisket and it was so salty and had a funky texture. Mac and cheese lacked any flavor. The Beans were so over spicy, you couldn't enjoy them. 4 of us ate here, and not one of us liked our food or said we'd come back. Sorry Pit Room, need to step up your game a few notches, you lost a few customers here.
