Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really wanted to fall head over heals for this place. I came for lunch and to get a few sweet treats for me.  I thought a weekday lunch would be the best time to try  this without having to wait in line for days.  First and foremost I hate parking lot stalking which you unfortunately have to do at this place due to its location. Good luck with the street parking also.  The layout inside is great very open and inviting and certainly has a modern french bakery decor.
