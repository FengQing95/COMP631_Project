Local Foods////Reminds me of some of the hipster places back in Brooklyn, only more clean cut and at a 30% discount. One orders at the register and then they give you a number card to place on the table of your choice. Music was happy club-like and the space felt comfortably airy. My order was top notch ingredient-wise and the presentation was simple and organized. The two sides (sweet beets, quinoa) were in perfectly measured cups. They were neighbored to the shrimp and blue crab sandwich; the three were placed inside a basket brought out by the server who looked out for the corresponding order number. I ate every morsel with glee. Service is friendly.
