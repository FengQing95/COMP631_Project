JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time at this gem in midtown. Ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen (pork dish) and it was delicious. Comes with sprouts and spinach and spicy broth.. mannnn. My only issue is it only comes with two smedium pieces of perfectly cooked, tender, finger licking pork slices. If you REALLY want to enjoy your meal, I'd recommend ordering extra meat with any of the ramen bowls bc my friends spicy chicken ramen came with the same amount. If you're a ramen eater, pull up. You won't regret it. Also, my wife and friend seemed to enjoy their drinks.. I'm not drinking at the moment so I can't share whether they're personally delectable or not, but the ramen alone should be your reason to go. Hope this yelps!
