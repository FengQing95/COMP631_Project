JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's a nice place to take people and hang out but the ramen is honestly not bad but also nothing to write home about. You can get the same quality at home for 1/10 the price by draining your ramen water, rinsing the noodles, and adding in fresh, hot water when making the broth. Add ins are obviously more expensive here than at home as well.
