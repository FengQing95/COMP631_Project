Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So this is my second time to this place since it opened a few weeks ago.  I enjoyed the pancakes so much I decided to bring some friends.  The wait was what I was expecting for a brand new brunch place in houston, consisting of about 1 hr and 30 mins to be seated and 45 minutes for the food to come out.  The bad review is for our server, which my receipt shows as Kandra.  I honestly am the easiest person to wait for, I order my water, I order my food and I never ask for more things in between.  I hate to inconvenience someone even if its part of their job. But I have to say that the way Kandra spoke to me by just asking her a simple question about a pancake and her impatience with my one simple question really ticked me off.  She ended up just cutting me off, rolling her eyes, and talking to me very condescending.  The only time she smiled was when she dropped off the check, all of a sudden she was incredibly friendly.  Thinking I may have over reacted, I asked my friend if my question about the pancake was confusing, and she too was shocked about how Ms. Kandra made the whole situation so incredibly rude.  Hating to tip bad, I still ended up tipping 25%. But I won't be coming back. Its unfortunate because the first time I came, everyone was so friendly but the food was ruined not by the wait time but by the horrible service by one server.
