Baby Barnaby's////Service was great. Nice guy! We are from LA and flying into Houston we were expecting great food. And this is the breakfast place to go to! We had the migas. Let me tell you!! It was absolutely great. They have fresh orange juice!!! And their coffee was awesome as well. I totally recommend this place.
