JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////-Our exact order was brought to a party sitting next to us, they looked a bit confused, but accepted the order anyway (I guess I can't blame them since everyone was waiting so long). They also ordered after us, so even if they had ordered the same thing, it probably should have come to our table seeing as the waiter was the same.
