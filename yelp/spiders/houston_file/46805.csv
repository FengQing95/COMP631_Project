Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went here for brunch after a night shift. Benedicts are pretty decent. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice as well and bright/Rachel Ray like. It's not the best eggs benedict that I've ever had in my life. But given the nice ambiance of the restaurant and solid food, this is a good choice for morning brunch. I will definitely be returning.
