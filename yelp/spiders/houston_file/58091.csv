Kata Robata////we were sad to see the bone marrow taken off the menu, but we stuck to our personal favorite Chef's Sashimi for Two, which never disappoints! Every assorted fish was fresh and melted in our mouth. It's served on a huge bowl of ice, which was very presentable. I also ordered the Fake ID, which is a mocktail of fever tree ginger beer, lychee, and lemon. It tasted like lychee lemonade and I loved it so much! We then ordered the Iberico Pork Shumai, which came with a splash of chili oil and ponzu sauce. This one was really cute, but it was okay in our opinion. Next was our foie gras & scallop sushi. And oh my god, it literally melts in your mouth. Highly recommend. We tried out the toro + uni + caviar sushi, which was $$ but everything tasted fresh and this was our first time trying a caviar that WASN'T super salty like other places. Then, we got the Texas Wagyu Katsu Sando, which was so crispy and flavorful -- also recommend. We ended the meal with Lobster & Crab Ramen, which was like a lobster bisque level thickness of a broth, and came with lots of lobster and lots of crab. This was the perfect balance to all the cold items we ordered earlier, and the noodles were perfectly al dente. I would literally come back forever for this ramen. It's amazing please try it there's nothing like it around town!!
