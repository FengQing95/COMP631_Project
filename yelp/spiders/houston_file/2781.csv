JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved my food here.  Definitely many flavors in one bowl to slurp up.  Since this is in midtown, it is kind of trendy, think cool lighting and ambience.  Prices I feel are reasonable.  I went during lunch on a weekday and hubby parked in the garage which is shared with other businesses such as Midtown 24 Hour Fitness. Service was good. Would definitely go again.
