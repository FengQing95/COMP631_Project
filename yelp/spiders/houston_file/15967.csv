JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Obviously hip place for the younger crowd, but the ramen was pretty good too. Open late but only pay parking near. Inside seems small and many were waiting outside. I ordered the house special Jinya tonkotsu black with no added toppings. It was already $13 and by adding anything it will easily pass $20 which is unheard of in Japan for a ramen of higher quality. Noodle was somen and not thicker egg noodle. The broth was not bad but not as thick as usual in Japan. Broth was just enough and total volume wasn't very much. It was good, but way overpriced targeted for young kids who don't know what ramen is.
