Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has a great atmosphere--games and free coffee while you wait for your table. The menu is extensive, both food and drink. Unfortunately I was not able to try any of there boozey concoctions (it was Sunday before 10AM). Due to popularity, the kitchen seemed very backed up. The food was definitely worth the wait though. We had the Sweet Potato Hash and the OMG French Toast --both were excellent.
