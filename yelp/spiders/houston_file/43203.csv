Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is super good. I would definitely come back for pastries and the food. The coffee and juice were delicious and I was impressed with the mimosa. They really take their time perfecting the pastries and desserts. Intricate detail on the decor. The place is kinda loud, but it's quick and consistently good. I go here on Sundays a lot because the service is pretty fast. Definitely worth a trip. I always get pastries to go.
