Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here for brunch. There was a pretty long line but it was worth it! We got the Chicken and Biscuits, Onion Soup, Truffle Mac N Cheese, and the mushroom goat cheese flatbread. They were all delicious! The flatbread is now one of my favorites. The crew were very friendly and helpful. I love how they had cups of water out by the coffee bar ready to grab. Brilliant idea! I would definitely come again for another brunch!
