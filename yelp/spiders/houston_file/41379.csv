Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////it's all just hype on the corner of dunlavy and westheimer. parking is difficult to get into because the drivers of houston don't know how to cross one of the most dangerous intersections in montrose. the location is a little stupid in my opinion but i get it. I've been once and have had a terrible experience, would just rather go to starbucks they got the morning/brunch idea on lock. common bond is just new. don't see them lasting very long.
