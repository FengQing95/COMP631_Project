Local Foods////Lots has already been written about this spot. I can't add alot, except that it is a very enjoyable place. A wide open dining area, order at the counter, and find a seat. A small menu of sandwiches, soups, and sides. The duck confit is very good. The mayo aoli is a bit to rich for me. Though the sandwich as a hole is good. The orzo, house made chips, and mintade are all awesome. The service at the counter is very knowledgable and the food comes out fresh. A very good spot to grab lunch in the village.
