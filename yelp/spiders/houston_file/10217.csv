JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Ramen is a really awesome place that is often crowded with a significant wait just to grab a seat.  Order a traditional ramen bowl and you can't go wrong.  But I will also say that the fried chicken appetizer was sublime and worth it as well.  Food can be as spicy or mild as you request.  Ambiance and service are great as well!  I love Jinya!  Ramen rules!!!!
