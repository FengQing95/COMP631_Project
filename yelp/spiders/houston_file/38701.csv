Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our food came out pretty quickly and tasted as good as it looked. The sticky bun wasn't as sweet as I expected but still balanced out the burger nicely. The cheese was melted really nicely, the fried egg was runny, and the thin shaved ham completed the sandwich perfectly. I had a bit of my friends dish too. CFS isn't really my thing in general but I still liked the sample.
