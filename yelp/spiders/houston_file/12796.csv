JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service makes the place! From the moment you walk in you are greeted with enthusiasm. The food is PHENOMENAL! Never have I ever liked brussel sprouts..... but these are a MUST HAVE. I could almost just go there and order them.  The Ramen is fun!  You could almost get the same ramen and make it so unique with all of the add ins! This location is a MUST TRY!
