Uchi////All in all it was good but three hours and the pacing was much too slow. The restaurant gets very loud and there are a lot of business people who can't hold their alcohol. They also say that the menu is meant to be shared, but everything comes out in awkward numbers like 5 pieces. Why not make it 6, which would take into account parties of 2 and 3 which seemed to be the most common? I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to pay more attention to details like as most other places too.
