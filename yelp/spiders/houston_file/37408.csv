Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The place seems really cool... really nice atmosphere. I think this would be a fun place to come for drinks with friends. As for the food, the appetizers all had meat in them except one (pimento dip)... being a pescatarian, that was all I could order. My friend who can't eat pork (but does eat other meat) was limited in options, too. Glad they had the pimento dip.
