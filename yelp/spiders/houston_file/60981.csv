Baby Barnaby's////So amazing I am a fan for sure. I had the huevos rancheros and I got a little eye happy and ordered a bagel which I did not touch because I wanted to eat all of my huevos. I recommend getting some bacon with it just to give it a little bit more texture and flavor and the salsa helps add acidity. My hubby had the Breakfast plate and loved it as well. We saw this beautiful buttermilk waffle but did not order it. MISTAKE! Even though I am not sure where I would be able to fit it. I was STUFFED! After we left for the next few days I was thinking about what I had and salivating. Seriously..soo sooo good.
