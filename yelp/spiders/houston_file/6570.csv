JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I felt completely disrespected. There are too many delicious ramen competitors these days and the close location to my apartment is not reason enough. I will not be back. I hate writing bad reviews but I cannot believe how I was treated. I also tried to make eye contact with the hosts and the one other waiter but they all ignored me as well as if to say "you're not in my section and I'm not interested." Ok. Byyye!
