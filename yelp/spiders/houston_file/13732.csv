JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Vegetable Soup Ramen is vegetarian y'all and it's quite delicious.  In fact, the husband liked my vegetarian option more than his porky meat-intense selection the first time we tried out JINYA, true story!  He ordered it with chicken broth a couple of visits later and was sadly not as enthused about it as it resulted in a blander broth.  It arrives, looking a bit like a salad, but underneath the leafy greens is a bowlful of veggie goodness and a healthy heaping of noodles.  I usually order a $1 side of tofu, the said super soft sad silken tofu that it is, I still need some protein up in my mix.  Oh, garlic fiends, be sure to request the free side of fresh garlic cloves to crush into your ramen.  Although, you'll probably want to be conscientious and remember to bring along some strong gum or mouthwash for later on.
