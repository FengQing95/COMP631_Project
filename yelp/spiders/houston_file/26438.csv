The Pit Room////Maybe it was just a bad night for them, but the sausage was absolutely horrendous. It was completely dried out and tasted like it was in the sun all day long. As for the brisket and ribs, same thing. Completely underwhelmed, especially with the quality BBQ scattered throughout Houston.
