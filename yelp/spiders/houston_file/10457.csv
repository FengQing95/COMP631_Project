JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First visit I got the tonkatsu black ramen added spicy. Yessssss, nothing beats ramen with a little kick.  The level of spicy includes mild, spicy, and hot.  Spicy was just right.  I did the ramen combo which comes with a bowl of ramen a small appetizers and a small salad.  I got the crispy chicken as the side and it was juicy, crispy and all meat. Salad is salad.  Now back to the ramen.  The tonkatsu black's garlic oil just slaps my palate.  I was disappointed that I didn't mix it well enough to the bottom.  Because once I hit the bottom of the bowl, it was all spicy and no garlic oil.  I give that bowl of ramen 6 out of 5 stars.
