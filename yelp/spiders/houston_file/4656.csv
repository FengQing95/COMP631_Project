JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I went on a Saturday night around 7p. There was a 20 min wait but it was worth it! The ramen was fantastic! I had the spicy chicken and my husband had the spicy pork, i believe. We also had the cauliflower appetizer which was good too! And the service was great! It's a small place and they only seat completed parties so they will skip you if everyone isnt there in the restaurant when they call you (no excuses for my friend is parking or they're walking), fyi.
