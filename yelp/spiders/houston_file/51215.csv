Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////3. Breakfast. Pot. PIE!!!: Move over biscuits and gravy, there's a new pastry in town. I stared in awe when the deconstructed "pot pie" was set in front of me. Homemade sausage gravy draped over an airy flaky puff pastry square, topped with a runny sunny-side up egg... The gravy is my second favorite in Houston (first being at the Breakfast Klub). The yolk from the sunny-side up egg gently ran into the gravy, as if they were always meant for each other... It's breakfast art is what it is!!!
