Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came for steak night on Monday. A lot of food for $24.99. Small salad, a roll, green beans, spicy Mac, and a NY strip steak. Spicy Mac was SPICY. Food wasn't bad for the price we were paying. The cornbread as an appetizer was alright (wouldn't order again). But the fried apple pie desert was the best part!!!
