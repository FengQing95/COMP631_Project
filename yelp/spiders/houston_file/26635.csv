The Pit Room////My friend and I had the lean brisket with two sides and a drink. The meal was somewhat of a high price- but we figured it was due to the neighborhood. The brisket char was nice on the outside with thick cuts of meat. There was a nice glaze of fat around the edge that definitely made the flavor nice. (I am not normally a person who likes any fat on the meat- but this was nice.) The sauce was ehhh- I really did not enjoy the sauce as it had a VERY salty taste to it. It may just be the batch however; I could not eat the meat with the sauce.
