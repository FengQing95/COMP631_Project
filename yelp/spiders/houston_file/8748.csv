JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The second time around I decided to come when I was actually sober to make sure that it wasn't the alcohol that made me jump overjoy for that ramen! I invited my family to come and we got there around dinner time and let me just say that it was a bad idea! There was a long waiting line. However, we got in in less than 20 minutes.
