Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In all honesty, the food, decoration, and music of Snooze really deserve 5 stars, but i'm docking one due to their host. She was incredibly rude throughout our interaction with her and was very adamant about her estimated waittime. We checked with her ONCE after almost two hours of wait, and she insisted that we TECHNICALLY had one more minute on the quoted time!!! After making us wait that ONE EXTRA MINUTE, she put all nine of us in a medium-sized booth in the very back of the restaurant, that would have more comfortably fit 4 to 6 people.
