Uchi////BEWARE:  This is one of those restaurants where they DONT ALLOW you to alter their menu.  It is what it is, take it or leave it.  Most of the time, or rather ALL of the time, I have an issue with this type of behaviour.  It's really rubs me the wrong way.  But, this restaurant was an exception.  The combinations of ingredients and the way they balance all the flavors and round them out into a complete whole...... you would have to be a culinary genius to subtract/add something from/to a dish and expect a good result.  In FACT, it's not allowed so that people don't ruin a perfectly well designed, curated, edited, tested dish and then go on Yelp and totally destroy their reputation.  I see why.
