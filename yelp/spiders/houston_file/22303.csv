Uchi////Uchi is sort of a modern Japanese fusion with a western twist. I have had nothing but amazing bites of food, great sips of drinks, and enjoyed good times in its intimate atmosphere! Cozy yet refined, it's difficult to get a table without a reservation. Also, your entire party better be there or you're SOL. Otherwise, enjoy the happy hour! The kara kyuri is one of my favorite drinks in Houston. If you like sake, get one - refreshing with a bit of a kick! I've had most items from the menu, and enjoyed the chef's choice omakase on special occasions. I tend to gravitate toward the uchiviche, machi cure, walu walu, and jar jar duck - all fantastic! The crispy Brussels sprouts are some of the best prepared in this city, and definitely worthy of the hype. Sometimes we order seconds! The zero sen is a favorite roll for many, including myself. The uchi salad is interesting - simply deconstructed with a tasty edamame-jalape√±o dressing on the side for dipping the romaine leaves. They have a good variety of sushi/sashimi to choose from, including some specials featured when available. The foie nigiri is heavenly! The sake toro and shime saba are delicious - the fish melts in your mouth like sweet butter. Honestly, I don't know what they do to the fish before they feed it to us patrons. Massage it while playing Chopin softly in the background? Idk... Maybe it's just the fact that they fly it in daily from Japan and Hawaii. All I know is, Uchi is here to stay, and for good reason!
