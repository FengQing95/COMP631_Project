Uchi////The walu walu entree was outstanding, from the appeal of the dish to the taste.  It was my first time having escolar, and it was pleasant.  The candied citrus eaten with the fish brought out so many more flavors that I wouldn't have thought to exist with fish.  This was an excellent choice to try!
