Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Hot Chicken Dip & Chips (1.5/5) - I'm not sure what I expected because I don't eat a lot of dip, but the cheesy sauce was waaaaaay too salty for me to eat more than 1-2 bites of. And it wasn't even hot or spicy! The house chips were good to munch on, though, but this was a huge miss in my opinion.
