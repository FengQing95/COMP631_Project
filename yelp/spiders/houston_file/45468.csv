Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Awesome cafe and bakery. So relaxing if you can get into a booth and just sit and chill. Their pain au chocolat was delicious. The pastry itself was buttery and flaky and the chocolate was just sweet enough. Their macarons are awesome, you can't get a bad flavor but my favorite is the salted caramel.
