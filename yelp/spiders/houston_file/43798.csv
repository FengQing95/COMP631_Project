Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My verdict, it's worth visiting common bond just to see what the hype is about. It's got a nice atmosphere and is a good place to catch up with a friend. I would get the desserts, but the pastries are cheaper. However, it's pricey so be ready for it to take a chunk out of your wallet (and wait in line for it too!).
