Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They have a limited menu, which I appreciate a lot because I don't like a lot of choices ( I get overwhelmed easily and indecisive with menus when there is too many good options). I had the biscuits and gravy; pretty good but wasn't as loaded with chunks of pork like the bacon one they had.
