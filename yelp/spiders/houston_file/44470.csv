Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common bond is personally my favorite place for breakfast or lunch. Their kitchen closes at 3 pm or else I would be here for dinner too. The outside and interior of the cafe are beautiful. It is a very clean and nice place but doesn't feel overly fancy. When you walk in, there is this huge display of pastries are beautiful and they also have a breakfast menu that you can order from.
