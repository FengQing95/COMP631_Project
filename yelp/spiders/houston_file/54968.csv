Kata Robata////-- Miso-Glazed Bone Marrow: this app's fattiness and richness levels will spoil you rotten. No, really. You're going to be bloated at the end of it. If you've never had bone marrow before, it's definitely something different. Whether you end up loving it or hating it, it's worth trying. For me, it was something to finally knock off my culinary bucket list.
