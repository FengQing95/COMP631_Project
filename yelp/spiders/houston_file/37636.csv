Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Brook and Westin were my bartenders and they were amazing! I work alot and typically enjoy my drinks with a laptop or over an excel sheet. They made my experience enjoyable and accompanied. I work in the food and beverage industry and I know it takes special people to work the bar with efficiency, Â consistency and personality. They were inclusive and very very nice. I will come back to visit them both. Brook was especially nice, I love her!
