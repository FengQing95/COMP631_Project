Kata Robata////A friend and I visited Kata Robata on a Wednesday night around 8pm. We were told the wait was about 40 minutes which was to be expected when we saw how busy it was when we walked in. I asked the hostess if we were able to order drinks at the bar while we wait she said yes and was very nice and let us know that the bar area was first come first serve, but offered the full menu if you're able to find a seat.
