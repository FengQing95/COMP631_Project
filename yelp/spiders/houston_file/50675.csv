Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I found my new favorite breakfast place The Frittata Egg White Fall was out of this world Lili had Bella Bella BeneThe service, food & the  ambience are definitely a 5. Clean bathroom too, you know me, that says a lot about a place. Our waitress, Alexis, is beautiful inside & out.
