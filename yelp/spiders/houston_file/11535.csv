JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I didn't know what to expect so was very surprised to see how packed it was. The hostess told us the wait would be about 15 min, and we were fine with sitting at the bar up front if that's faster, but we did get seated in about 10 min. We got a cozy booth for 2. I did notice there were 2 community tables in the center, which I like because that means you can have big groups, or it might be fun to share the table with strangers. Maybe.
