Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Boss cat was amazing!! Me and my boyfriend came here for he's 31st birthday and had an amazing time. The atmosphere was amazing the drinks were great. I would recommend the "my last vice" drink it was delicious. The macaroni with bacon was my favorite. I ordered the lobster dump pasta it was awful I've never sent a dish back before but I couldn't imagine eating another bite. I wouldn't suggest that meal. I the server was very kind and understanding he was great. I would suggest the tomato soup with grilled cheese. This definitely isn't a place to get the best food but the drinks do not disappoint will be back soon.
