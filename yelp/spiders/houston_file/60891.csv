Baby Barnaby's////This place does food right. Brought my visiting sister and brother-in-law here after church for a bite when we didn't have the patience to wait on a long brunch waitlist. Broke my heart that they don't serve brunch after noon (when I'm still in the church parking lot), but their lunch menu is hard to beat. I had a humongous, artery-clogging chili cheese burger with their regular fries, and I was happier than I could put into words. My sister had a salad that she loved, and my brother in law described his burger as "one of the best he's ever had". It helped that our waiter was absolutely the sweetest, most helpful, and hysterical waiter. Solid venue, street parking is your best bet, and you will leave SO full. Love ya, Barnaby's!
