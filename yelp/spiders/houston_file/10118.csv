JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good service, friendly waiters and reasonable prices (around $10 per ramen bowl). I only have two complaints--put more veggie ramen combos on the menu and expand! The queue often extends to outside the restaurant, which makes the place look hip and trendy but gets tired after a while.
