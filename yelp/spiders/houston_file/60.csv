Local Foods////This place appealed to me on paper, so I tried it for lunch one day.  Local Foods will do just fine with omnivore clientele who want to join the trendy locavore movement (don't get me wrong - more power to 'em, and more power to our local farmers).  it's just not for me, though.  My major dislike is that the menu doesn't disclose some key ingredients, like the kale salad being loaded with grated cheese.  I get that a lot of people would consider the cheese a bonus, but it's a big digestive no-no for me.  Luckily, I caught sight of it as they were packing up my meal, and they accommodated me by switching to a different side dish per a simple request.   Ultimately, though, I was left unimpressed by the vegan options.  The flavors were either overpowering or underwhelming, and the selection was limited (especially since they were out of some dishes).  The price point was about $5 more expensive than what I spend on a meal from the Whole Foods salad bar, which is a pretty incredible feat.
