The Pit Room////Great BBQ.  Brisket and ribs are both great as in you dont need a drop of bbq sauce - they are that good. They also have homemade pickles that are worth the trip themselves. Parking can be tough and there is a wait sometimes but its worth it.  On weekends they have a cucumber and tomato salad that is something you should try. Enjoy!
