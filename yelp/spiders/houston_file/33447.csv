Local Foods////Food quality is top-notch...fresh organic materials. I've tried every single item on the menu, but my favorite one is the smoked salmon sandwich. The soup is amazing, but you get a better deal if you pick the two sides instead...I can eat their quinoa and kale literally all day. If you get a salad and you decide to add shrimp for extra cost, they actually give you a bunch of shrimp. I remember eating it, and every bite had a couple shrimps, so don't hesitate to add it because they are not frugal with the meat.
