The Pit Room////Yeah so I have lived in Houston for 6 years and this is my first visit. Clearly I have not been living my best life. There were about 35 people ahead of us in line but thankfully we were not deterred. The brisket melted like butter in my mouth and the ribs were juicy. Â I got the 2 meat dinner for $17 and change. It came with 2 sides. I had the charred green beans. When i tell you that could have been a review in and of itself yum. And the potato salad was right - true mustard potato salad. Will definitely be back again.
