Kata Robata////The service here was also spot on with a genuine knowledge of their best fish and not just the standard tuna and salmon. The chirashi was the best I've had and I greatly appreciated the run down of all the fish. Of note, the snapper here is incredible. And while I tend to be a traditionalist on sushi rolls, we opted for a more fusion esque "tropical spicy tuna" roll that included mango, tuna, avocado, salmon, and roe with a wasabi vinaigrette. Absolutely epic.
