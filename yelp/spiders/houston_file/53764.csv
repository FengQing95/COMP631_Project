Kata Robata////You must go and try the Spicy Soy Ramen!  I now have my husband and sister addicted.  I drive from Friendswood regularly because I totally crave it.  And if you don't finish it all and want it "to go", they separate the liquid from the noodles so that they won't get soggy.  Genius!  Thank you Kata Robata - this helps me enjoy you 2 days in a row!  Next time I may just get a whole separate order of it to go!
