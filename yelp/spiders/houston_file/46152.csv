Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////P.S. Parking here can be a bit difficult, but they have two parking lots.  One right next to the establishment itself and another one a little further down if you just keep driving.  Both don't have that many spots, though.  Due to this reason, I would try to come at off-peak hours.
