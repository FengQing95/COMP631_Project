Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When we sat down, my friends and I picked several pastries, and we shared them at our table. The pastries were big, fluffy, and flaky. It was my first time having a kugelhopf. It was doughnut-like, light, and tasted similar to a danish at the same time. I had orange juice to wash down my breakfast, but I wished it came in a bigger glass is all. The customer service was great. They gave customers linen napkins, checked on us, and bussed tables for us.
