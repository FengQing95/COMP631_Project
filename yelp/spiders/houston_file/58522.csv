Baby Barnaby's////Went here for the first time in a long time on a homecoming trip to Houston with a few friends i hadn't seen in a long time. I always forget that this place exists, mostly because it isn't on or near a major street, so i rarely find myself driving down Fairview and then wondering to myself why i never go there. A friend of mine from college, who just moved to Houston about a month ago suggested we go there and i happily agreed.
