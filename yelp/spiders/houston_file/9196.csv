JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I decided to try jinya after hearing everyone raving about it. I loved the whole ambiance and our server was attentive and kind. However, the food was less than what I had expected. I ordered the tonkotsu black ramen and it was just average. Halfway through eating the ramen I got tired of it. I'll probably come back and give a different ramen a try.
