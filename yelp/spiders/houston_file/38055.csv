Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for a Saturday brunch and sat in the back. The manager was really nice and raised the "garage door" so that we could enjoy the beautiful weather. I just then realized that the Saturday and Sunday menus were different. I had been looking forward to trying the fruity pebbles french toast, but it was on the Sunday menu, so I opted for the barrel aged breakfast (thick pancake with whiskey maple syrup, bacon, and fried egg in a skillet pan) instead. It was great - crunchy on the edges and soft and fluffy on the interior. I liked how the sweetness of the pancake balanced with the savoriness of the bacon. My dining partner ordered the salmon & veggie hash, which I also liked a lot. We both thought that the corn to other ingredient ratio was a bit on the high side though. Service was nice, but I felt that it was a bit overbearing. The server approached us at least 3x during the 1 hour meal, not including bringing us plates or the check. The ambiance is casual and down-to-earth.
