Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Tried the Houston location on Sunday (it was the first weekend they opened and peak brunch time so we expected a long wait for our large group) and waited about 2 hrs. We have eaten at the Denver and San Diego locations and every time have waited about 30 to 60 minutes, so it's not just a new location thing. However, the wait is worth it. This location is actually bigger than the others. I have never had anything bad at any location and Houston is no exception. Drinks were delicious and food was hearty and flavorful. Even though it was a mad house, our waitress was nice and never pushy. I will definitely return and wait happily.
