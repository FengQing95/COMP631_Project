Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Been wanting to try this place for quite some time. We came around 1230p on a wed and there were no lines which was perfect. Their chicken torta sandwich was amazing especially on homemade torta bread. I love that they used Mexican crema and cotija cheese and had a nice spicy kick with the chicken and jalapenos. The almond croissants are the best so far in houston. We will be coming back to try more items.
