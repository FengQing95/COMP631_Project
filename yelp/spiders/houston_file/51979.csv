Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Upon finishing, we were given an electronic tablet to pay for our meal. This is definitely better if you're paying with credit card, but cash is a bit of a nightmare as you have to wait for already busy servers to come give you change. Regardless, Snooze was a pretty great experience and I'll definitely be back (though sometime EARLY to avoid those pesky lines...)
