Uchi////I hate their new menu.  I use to come here a lot but once the head head chef had left, it really isn't as good anymore.  I sat at the sushi table and my chef was so absent minded and took so long to get my order that I, originally, came here not hungry but I had to wait so long for my order that I got hungry and angry.  It was not a busy Sunday.  He forget the ingredients on my sushi too.  Yeah, I come here enough to know what's suppose to be on my sushi!  And the new menu... Food is not good.  Took out some of the good stuff that use to be on there too like tempura escolar.  I use to love Uchi but now I haven't been back in months.  Nothing to go back to.
