JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Stopped in to try something new and read decent reviews here on Yelp. Was surprised to find out it was actually a chain, which I didn't discover until arriving and getting that "chain" feeling, peeking my interest to look at their website. The atmosphere is fairly hip feeling but the printed menu itself seemed chain oriented.
