Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Soon after, our food arrived, and it was delicious! I really enjoyed my biscuits and gravy, and everyone else was very positive about their orders as well. For example, someone mentioned that it was the best breakfast he'd ever had, so that's pretty decent praise :) Overall, would definitely go back!
