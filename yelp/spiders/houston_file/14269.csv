JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So I wanted to love this place. Great ambiance. Went there at 4:30 pm and it was packed. Well staffed. Smelled delicious. I went with the Tonkotsu Black, but in retrospect should have tried the brisket because Cheu Noodle Bar in Philadelphia makes an incredible brisket ramen. Comparing the Jewish inspired brisket with Texas brisket would have been interesting.
