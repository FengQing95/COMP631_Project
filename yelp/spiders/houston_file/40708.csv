Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We self parked on the street for free and walked less than five minutes to the door. We had a reservation I booked last minute for 8:45 as the earliest they had available. But we showed up at 8 and were seated immediately. My husband LOVES bourbon and we were seated along the Whiskey Room wall so we were able to gawk at the collection they have. We wanted to have some Pappy 10 yr, but they were out. So he went with an Old Fashioned and it was good. We had the ahi tuna lettuce wraps as a starter and they were DELICIOUS!!! I made a note to self that I will make a meal of those next visit. My husband had the catfish and subbed the risotto for a plank of potatoes that he thoroughly enjoyed....very yummy.
