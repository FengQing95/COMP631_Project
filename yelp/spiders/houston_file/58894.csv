Baby Barnaby's////Recently, we had a party of 6 and we had to wait a very long time. As is Â expected when you go out to eat on the weekend with a large party. The thing that I didn't expect was the great service we received after waiting so long. The servers were super warm and apologetic about the wait. We also received a fresh fruit bowl for our table. I was very impressed with the service we received.
