JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Then the soup bowl came. Looked pretty good at first. But wait, only two slices of pork? Maybe my memory fails me but I thought there was more meat last time. Well at least they can't ruin the "seasoned egg" I think to myself. Wrong! There was a decidedly sour taste to the yellow gooey inside. Hey, I'm Asian, so I know what Thousand year old egg is supposed to taste like. Wondering whether I should spit it out or run the risk of salmonella?
