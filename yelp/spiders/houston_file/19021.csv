Uchi////Our reservation was for 7:45pm. We didn't get seated until 8:50pm. That's one hour and five minutes that we were waiting. Yes, this location is new. Yes, this location is trending with the Houston foodies. Yes, Uchi is all about serving dishes one at a time and letting the diners experience their food instead of just eat it. But still. Why book that many people for the same time if you know that eating there takes a long time? Many restaurants refuse to take reservations for a certain time to avoid what happened to me. I would prefer to be denied a reservation rather than standing and waiting for over an hour wondering why I made the reservation in the first place.
