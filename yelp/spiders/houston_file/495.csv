JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I'm sorry you were disappointed by the food.  The broths we carry do vary in fattiness, taste and thickness.  Our #1 Tonkotsu Black is the more "traditional" Japanese Hakata style ramen similar to what they serve in Japan.  Thus, it will be a bit more fatty and thick.  We carry 12 different kinds of ramen on our menu and no two are alike.  Should you ever return, I would recommend you try the Yatai ramen, which is a veggie and light chicken broth based and is one of my favorites.  It's light, yet very flavorful and doesn't give you the feeling like you're eating something really heavy.
