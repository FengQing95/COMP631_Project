Uchi////Non of the flavors "Wowed" me instead I was disappointed that this was all Uchi offered. Everything was sweet and it was just too much sweet to be savory. The flavor that was there I've had before in a diner in Chinatown. I can see this being amazing for some people, but I have had way better sushi and at a way more reasonable cost. The ingredients was nothing super special. I just don't get what all the hype is about . . . maybe I didn't order the right dishes. However I will say the service was very efficient. The servers and food runners were very knowledgeable or at least they were very good with memorizing the menu descriptions. Overall, I think this is more of a place that taste with your eyes than your taste buds.
