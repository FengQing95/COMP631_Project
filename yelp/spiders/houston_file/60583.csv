Baby Barnaby's////Super misleading website and online menu. The google and yelp page both take you to barnaby cafe website and at the very bottom of the menu page there's a different link for baby barnabys separate menu. The only vegan options are sides like black beans, corn tortillas, fruit, and avocado. Even the veggie sausage isn't vegan.
