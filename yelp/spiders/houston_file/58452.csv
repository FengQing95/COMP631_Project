Baby Barnaby's////that's all i can say. i mean, yes, my potatoes & sausage were also delicious. yes, my friends' french toast and bagel were wonderful & toasted to perfection. yes, the coffee's good. yes, our waitress was rad & helpful & not around too too much but we always had full coffee cups & water glasses. yes, the atmosphere is good & the joint is bright and perfect for a sunday afternoon. but gracious sakes alive, those green freaking eggs!
