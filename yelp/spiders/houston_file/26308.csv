The Pit Room////So after reading about this place in a popular Texas magazine, we definitely wanted to try it.  Wanting to avoid the lunch rush, we arrived around 2p on a Friday.  There was no wait.  Walking to the counter, we noticed their "fixings" bar, which has homemade pickles you need to try. There's also their homemade salsa that is also good. We each order 3 meat plates.... fatty brisket, sausage, jalapeño sausage, chicken, and pork ribs with mustard potato salad, coleslaw, grilled okra, and i think the name is ranchero beans.  So the brisket was fine, needed a tad more seasoning and hubby felt it needed more smoke flavor,  definitely not Franklin or Killen's good; didnt care for the sausage. . The texture was off; the pork ribs were a bit dry but had good flavor; the chicken (white part) was the best meat of these... sides were fine too. We also ordered their Texas Chili, and while it had the look of a great chili, i did not like the fact they add cinnamon to it... who puts cinnamon in chili?  The prices are very reasonable when you compare to other top rated BBQ places in Texas.  Overall, we were disappointed.
