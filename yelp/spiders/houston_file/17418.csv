Uchi////Love uchi. Most likely the best happy hour in Houston. I have been to both uchi and uchiko in Austin, and I have to say I love this uchi. It brings the best of both the menus from Austin and has it's own great items as well. I can never leave without an order of brussel sprouts, Hama chile, and a fried milk. Just those three dishes are perfect, but why would I just stop there? Definitely a great restaurant, and a staple for me.
