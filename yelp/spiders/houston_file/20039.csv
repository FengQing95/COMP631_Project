Uchi////This place is amazing! We were celebrating a client's divorce and not only was Lori, our waitress, but the entire staff, made our first time wonderful. The food was impeccable. Go with the tastings. On top of that, the entire staff presented our client with a cookbook that they all signed wishing her the best with her new life. I will come here again!!!!!! I'm just speechless right now.
