JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Recently went here for the first time and this review is solely based on their appetizers because I have yet to try the ramen! Yes I know a ramen joint and I didn't even get to eat the ramen, but I will be back for it. The takoyaki was a hit. Pretty good and the dough was fluffy, just wished there was more meat in it. The tempura Brussels sprouts were mediocre, almost below average. Very bland, tasted sweet like same dip for everything else. The truffle fries were good, well the fries with truffle ketchup. Basic but I enjoyed it. Service was good, and now it's time for me to come back to try their ramen. Â I'd give it more of a 3.5/5
