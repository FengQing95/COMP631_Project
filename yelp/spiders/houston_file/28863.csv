The Pit Room////We ordered brisket, turkey, beef and venison sausage. We also had sides of coleslaw, mustard potato salad, elote, and green beans. Hubby came home and the smell of the bag was mouthwatering! He also seemed to go to town on the condiments! I like that they offer pickled green onion as a condiment. I also love how they offer something a little different than your standard sausage by offering venison. I enjoyed the turkey. The brisket was a bit on the fattier side, and I typically prefer cuts that are more lean, but hubby loved it. Everything here is on the spicier side which I love, but just know that going in. While everything was great, perhaps my favorite thing here is the green beans. They completely blew me away, and I've never been a huge fan of green beans so I welcomed the surprise. They were charred, garlic heavy, and included caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes with a splash of soy sauce. Soooo good! I could eat these everyday!
