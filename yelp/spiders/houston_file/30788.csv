The Pit Room////Justifiably famous. The four of us split the feast #1 (or whatever it's called) and did not really get close to finishing it. The beef rib and sausage were unsurprisingly excellent. The brisket though was a little tough. But the surprise star was turkey which was wildly moist and flavorful. It's a crazy thing to say but it might have been my favorite of the meats (ok it's a lie, my favorite was the beef rib but beef rib is always good). The elote side is also particularly good. My friend had the great wisdom to add some flour tortillas to our order and I suggest you do as well.
