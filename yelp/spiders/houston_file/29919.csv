The Pit Room////This bbq never disappoints!! The sliced beef offers this rustic/dry rub that accentuates the Smokey flavor. What I like the most, is the minimal amount of Fat on the meat and you can pair it with sides or by itself and it will still taste amazing!! They also have a variety of bottled beverages and beers that are delicious and the drive thru it easy and quick
