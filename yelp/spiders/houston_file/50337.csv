Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So I am not sure if I just had an off day but I had the bella bella benedict and I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. I think that people hyped it up wayyyy too much for me. There are other brunch places I thinks serve the same purpose without having to deal with the wait. The mimosa I ordered was very strong and very good. I definitely plan to come back and try the pancakes as those seem to be the most popular thing on their menu.
