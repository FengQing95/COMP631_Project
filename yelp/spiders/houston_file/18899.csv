Uchi////From the moment that I walked into Uchi I knew that this was going to be a truly amazing dining experience. I was able to get reservation to the soft opening on the second night and the all the food was 50% off. And because it was the only the second night of the operation, I of course expected some hiccups and glitches, which there were a few. However every staff member treated you like an absolute rock star. Whether you were rich or poor, you felt as if you were the only person inside of a restaurant that was absolutely packed with people. When your waitress brought you your food, they took the time to explain every little intimate detail about the course you were about to indulge yourself in. The experience was gratifying in nearly every single way. It was an experience that I will remember for a very long time to come and the food was absolutely out of this world. So let me take you on my food journey.
