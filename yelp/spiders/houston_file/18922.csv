Uchi////My last review was on 8/2/10--over a year ago.  But just before I permanently gave up on writing reviews because the elite badge perpetually slipped my grasp, I realized that writing reviews on Yelp is not about obtaining the coveted elite badge, it's about sharing your honest opinions about good or bad food, especially when you feel inclined to yelp to the world (pun intended) how incredibly deep and delectably complex the culinary creations at Uchi Houston turned out to be.  If you're lazy, here's the takeaway--Eat. Uchi. Now.  If you're just curious about the food, proceed to the bulleted portion of this review.  For those of you curious about the whole Uchi Houston experience, read on, my delightful friend.
