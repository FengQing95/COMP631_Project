Kata Robata////The Chef's Sashimi for Two came beautifully served on a HUGE clear bowl topped with a bag of ice and lots of floral and various herbs as decoration. This was served with 8 different cuts each with about 4-5 slices. We were served salmon, tuna, sweet shrimp, fatty tuna, amberjack, snapper, yellow tail and golden eye snapper. I prefer fatty cuts so the fatty tuna and salmon here are my favorites. For leaner cuts the snappers are more ideal. The sweet shrimp was a delicious surprise, rich buttery taste with a sweet finish. (Can be rather fishy if you aren't used to eating raw fish)
