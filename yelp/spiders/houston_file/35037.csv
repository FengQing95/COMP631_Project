Local Foods////As an Austinite, I tend to be a bit critical of places in other cities, but this was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. Everything was flavored well, and it all combined wonderfully for a medley of deliciousness and freshness. Unlike many lunch places (where a food coma is inevitable) I left there feeling energized and rejuvenated. I'm already looking forward to an opportunity to go back.
