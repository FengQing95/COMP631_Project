Uchi////Now the reason why this trip upset me was because it was our anniversary. We expected to love every dish ,like we usually do, but after every dish we were like "ehh" nothing was great, and the dessert was just bad for us. If this was any other place I wouldn't be so disappointed, but it's Uchi . We spent a lot of money on a mediocre meal. Left feeling like we were robbed. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the plates looked beautiful and service was nice.
