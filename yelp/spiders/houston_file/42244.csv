Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Quite a surprise. We were told that these folks have the best croissants in Houston. Of course the person was a random stranger who happened to sit at our table the day before. Anyhow we took his advice. Madame had an outstanding croissant. I had a Kouigin Amman that was to die for. Then of course a pain au chocolat before the long drive home to Dallas.
