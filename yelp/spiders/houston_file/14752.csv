JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We had the cauliflower and crispy chicken for appetizers (both delicious, but the crispy chicken won hands down). I then got the premium tonkotsu white, which has pork and chicken broth. Amazing. The broth itself was great, but with the green onions, fried onions and mushrooms, it was delicious. The pork melted in my mouth. The service was very good. I can't wait to go back!
