JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We frequent this place about once a month. We are huge fan of all things ramen and this place serves one of the best in town. The tonkatsu is a standing favorite. Their wait time is a problem, generally long lines and difficult parking. Last time, we were told to come back after 45 minutes, and so we decided to sit down at the bar next door, ordered our drinks and we were called after 15 minutes! Also, a group of 5 people should get 3x2 tables put together, not 2x2.
