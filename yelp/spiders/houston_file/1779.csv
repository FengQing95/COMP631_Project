JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm sorry if you feel the prices are a little pricey compared to other mom and pop ramen joints.  Jinya is a franchised business and thus more overhead that we, as franchisees, must pay.  Royalties, advertising expenses, mystery shopper programs, etc. all add up while we still try to remain profitable so we can stay in business.  I do agree that Jinya isn't your typical ramen shop being that the design was created to fit the Midtown scene.  That's being said, future location development in Houston may have a more "toned down" theme.  We appreciate your feedback and your patronage and hope that you will return again to Jinya and try our other selections.
