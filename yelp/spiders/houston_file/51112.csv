Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been to a few different locations across Texas and Colorado. First time I left feeling angry. Food was not to usual standard, eggs over done, pancakes still soupy. Found a hair in the pancake flight they brought for my kid which was ordered as a kids pancake, they comped her chocolate milk, I guess that helps? She was covered in topping with in seconds with help from the forks that notoriously refuse stay on the plate. Would have been nice to have a kids fork. This slow motion train wreck happened to the soothing sounds of Snoop Dogg rolling down the street smoking endo. We left wondering what alternate dimension we just had breakfast in.
