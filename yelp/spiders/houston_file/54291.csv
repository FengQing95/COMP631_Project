Kata Robata////I used to absolutely love this place but within the last year I honestly feel it's starting to go down hill. The portions are now extremely small, the sushi is still fresh but you barely get a sliver of tuna when ordering and the staff is always hurried and rushed. Everything still tastes great but you can't help but feel that they're skimping to make more money even though it is always busy and you need reservations if you don't want to wait. Hope this place gets back to its roots soon.
