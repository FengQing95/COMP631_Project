Kata Robata////I  this place!! The atmosphere is great and the staff is very knowledgable. I always found the food, especially the sushi, to be fresh. I've tried the bone marrow, the carpaccio, and a few different rolls! I recommend broadening your horizons and trying something unusual at this place! If you just love signature rolls, ocean picante and rising sun are my favorite! The lobster mac and cheese is light on the lobster but very flavorful! The banana creme brûlée is amazingly rich and complex.ake sure to have reservations as the wait can get quite long and unfortunately they close pretty early! Oh and try the peppercorn salmon sashimi!
