JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi May - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you felt the amount of pork chashu in your Tonkotsu White was lacking. Every item that goes into every one of our ramen bowls is done in a meticulous fashion. As a franchise concept, we must follow the guidelines handed down to us by our corporate office. Very little gets "eyeballed" when it comes to preparing our ramen. I'm not sure what you mean when you write: "all they did was add more noodles." We serve a fixed amount of noodles for every standard bowl. Additional noodles cost $2.
