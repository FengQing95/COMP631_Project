Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh my goodness, the chicken on a biscuit is perfect. The biscuit is the best biscuit I've ever had probably, which is amazing that I remember that because it had a huge fried chicken slab and smothering of bechamel on top, which were also amazing. The fried chicken was good, of course, but for me the battering was really thick. (The ratio of crust to chicken was 3:2. I'd prefer 1:2 haha - more chicken than crust.)
