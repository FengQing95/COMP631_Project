Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Randomly found this on a foodie Instagram. The fruity pebble French toast looked good so I had to go the next day for Sunday brunch! They have heaps of whiskey anything you like lots of pappy. The brunch food was absolutely delicious. It was actually really hard to decide what we wanted cause everything sounded so tasty. And it was! We got the totchos (tater tot nachos), the short rib chilequiles, and the very popular fruity pebble French toast. I also really wanted to get the Nutella s'mores pancake and the meatloaf hash but we wouldn't have been able to eat that much. They gave me extra condensed milk to pour over the top of the toast. So tasty! The waiter, Cam, was really helpful and friendly, we gave him a big tip :) The portions for brunch were actually not very big which is good because it was pretty heavy but to be fair that's kinda what you want with brunch. Anyway would def recommend and come back for another meal!
