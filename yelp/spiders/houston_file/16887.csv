JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been to several ramen places around town before but Jinya Ramen made quite an impression on me. I like that they have several different broth, noodles, and meat options. Aside from the regular tonkotsu they have chicken broth and even a vegetable broth for vegetarians. Therefore, I decided to try their spicy chicken ramen bc it sounded different and I'm not that into pork belly...(yes, I said it).
