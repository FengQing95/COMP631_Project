Uchi////This has been my second time coming to uchi. The first was when it first opened, when it was super hard to get a reservation. This time around, not so hard. We wanted to try their hh dishes, it was easy to get a reservation, Â the staff was very accomodating! We added an extra person amd didn't call ahead. I brought my 2 month old son, so they sat our party of 5 without the full party being there. They changed our table when they notices that the car seat would not fit in the booth they originally sat us at. Since they were sooo nice, I gave uchi 5 stars! Its hard being a mom and wanting to enjoy fine dining at the same time.
