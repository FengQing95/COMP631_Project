Uchi////Btw, happy hour is a STEAL! I made it over on my day off last week, and my husband and I actually ordered every single item on the menu except for the ham and eggs (b/c I don't eat ham, and he doesn't eat eggs). You'd better believe I'll be here the next time it becomes remotely possible for me to be somewhere by 5 pm. Amaaaazing.
