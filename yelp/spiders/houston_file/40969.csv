Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First off, shout out to my man Gavin. When we sat at the bar, Gavin immediately greeted our party helped us decide on what drinks to order. Let me tell you, this man knows his drinks. We ordered the nighthawk, the old fashion, and the bosscat. Probably the best three drinks on their menu. If you're a fan of espresso coffee, you have to, HAVE TO order the nighthawk.
