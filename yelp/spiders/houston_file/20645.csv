Uchi////One of my most favorite sushi restaurants I've ever been to in my entire life. The service was very pleasant.  I got the sushi tasting course. Sushi was fresh and delicious and rice seems to be prepared at high level. If you read this review don't look anywhere else, just go to Uchi and see for yourself.
