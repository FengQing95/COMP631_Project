Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We both had the tomato/eggplant bisque with chopped walnut sprinkles. It was great. I kept thinking it was so comforting. It was smooth and thick with creamy goodness of sharp tomato. I couldn't taste the eggplant but no surprise there, who can? Eggplant just doesn't have much flavor - possibly why it's called eggplant.
