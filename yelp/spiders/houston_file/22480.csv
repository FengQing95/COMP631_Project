Uchi////First and foremost, we made reservations because this place is hard to get into otherwise.  If the entire party does not arrive within 15 minutes of the reservation, they give it away.  Also, parking is valet or street, although it can be hard to find street parking as its Montrose-near-Midtown.  We parked two blocks away, arrived on time, and were seated within 3 minutes.
