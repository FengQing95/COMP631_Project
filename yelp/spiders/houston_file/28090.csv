The Pit Room////I swear I come here at least twice a month. The food is legit. I order the beef brisket sandwich with potato salad. Yum yum. The portions are just the right size. They have a condiment bar with salsa and jalape√±os. Add this on top of the brisket sandwich with BBQ sauce and I promise you won't regret it. The only con is the long line, but I guess that's a good thing! The most I've had to wait was 10 minutes. I would get there early to beat the dinner rush. There aren't that many seats in the restaurant either, but the bus boys always do a great job of getting the tables cleared off quickly for the next diner.
