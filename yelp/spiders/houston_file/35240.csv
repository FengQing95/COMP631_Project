Local Foods////I ordered the bacon, egg, and steak sandwich, which was supposed to have a fried egg on top, with shredded steak. I substituted the jalape√±o bun for a pretzel bun. For my sides, I chose fresh seedless watermelon and the pasta salad. The egg on the sandwich was fully cooked- nothing fried about it, and the steak tasted more like salted jerky than anything. It was a complete disappointment, and overly salty to the point that I could only eat a quarter of it. Thankfully I had the watermelon to try to balance out the saltiness. I wouldn't recommend this sandwich at all. I ended up leaving here still hungry and not at all satisfied.
