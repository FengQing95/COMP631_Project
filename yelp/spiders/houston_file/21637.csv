Uchi////The decor is excellent and lends itself to a nice date night. I would not recommend bringing young kids during prime times as the crowd might not enjoy crying babies. If you get to Uchi before your restaurant, I highly recommend the bar area for a good drink. The bartenders are among the best in Houston and the selection is amazing. Naturally, if you are going for wine, they cater to a fish-eating offering that is mostly light reds or crisp whites.
