Uchi////The Jar Jar Duck, Food & Wine's Top 10 Restaurant Dishes of 2011, did not live up to the hype. The first time I went and ordered it, I didn't even get it.. Just the bill for it.. Second visit, it came out overcooked and tough. Like Matt said, you get the unwelcoming 'this is burnt' smell when you open the jar. It had four different cuts of duck (w/different textures), but there really was only one flavor. Its $30, so I do what anyone else would do, and I send it back. Waiter apologizes and bring out a fresh one.. Not as tough, still rather bland.. Maybe I'm spoiled from years of eating Beijing Duck??
