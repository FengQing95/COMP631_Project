Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The cheesecake itself wasn't sweet, but it was fluffy, the bottom had a very thin dark chocolate crust. Still nothing amazing. Â I washed it all down with a cold topo chico $2.25, and would have gladly skipped the calories and stuck with just that if I knew that the cheesecake wasn't the cheesecake I imagined it be.
