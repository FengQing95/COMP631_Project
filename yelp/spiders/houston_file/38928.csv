Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Hip place, great service, yummy food. Make sure you try the Fruity Pebbles French Toast if you come for brunch. My friends and I came around 11 on a Sunday morning, so naturally it was fairly crowded. We still managed to get a table quickly though. They take reservations as well, so if I come here again, especially with a larger group, I will be sure to reserve a table ahead of time. Love the "industrial chic" decor of the entire restaurant. Bosscat Kitchen is a fresh, young, and lively restaurant that I would happily visit again.
