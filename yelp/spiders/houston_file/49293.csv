Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came to this restaurant yesterday at 10:00A.M., and the wait was about 35-40 minutes. While my friend and I waited, the complimentary coffee was gone, and we asked the ladies up front to refill it twice. However, they never refilled it. After about 40 minutes, we received a text to sit down and eat. My friend ordered the OMG French toast, and I ordered an omelette with rye bread and black beans. The beans were salty and not very warm so I didn't eat too many of them, and they served me white bread instead of rye. Hence, I had to wait for about ten minutes just to receive another type of bread. In addition, the restroom was not clean and other parts of the restaurant didn't look presentable. I understand that they were busy, but it didn't seem like they had enough workers available on that day. Overall, I think the food is overhyped, and I prefer other places in Houston over Snooze.
