JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I also sigh at the unjustness of it all. So many Vietnamese places give a tasty broth, lots of noodles, generous amount of meat, plate of fresh, raw veg, and make way, way less than this place. Yeah, it's not apples to apples, but it's not apples to oranges either: they're satisfying bowls of steaming noodle soup. Is it cuz it's Japanese cuisine, Midtown, "bar", sleek...? Y u get mo money and fame 4 worse tasting noodle soup Jinya??
