Kata Robata////Late night eat, decided to come by here as some of my friends have never tried this place out.  As usual, they browse through the sushi section and I am browsing the whole menu to see what is cooked or something I can eat.  Lucky me!!! I ended up ordering three items: seaweed salad, the Wagyu Sushi, and the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  All three items were phenomenal.
