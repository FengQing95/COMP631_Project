Uchi////This place is AMAZING! Food is delicious and very presentable. The only downfall is wait is very long can sometimes be close to 2 hours. Sometimes you can't even get reservations. Book early! Also all their plates have very little food so expect to spend like $300/couple if you want to leave full. If you are a sushi/sashimi lover come here. Fresh and high quality good
