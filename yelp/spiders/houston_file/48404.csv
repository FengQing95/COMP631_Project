Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is good but the wait is a killer. Have waited al least an hour to get a table and they don't really have a proper waiting area (you sort of just hang out in the parking lot). The parking is also not that great at this location. Overall good food and service but not worth more than a 30 min wait.
