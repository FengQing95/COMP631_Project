Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Don't get the Caesar salad. It is literally two stocks of romaine lettuce with a few rotten anchovies on it. After taking the disgusting fish off the stocks, I had to cut my own salad. Who the hell cuts their own salad?! The only good thing about this salad is the croutons. The whole dish has a fishy taste and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
