Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Cute brunch spot bursting with loads of energy and good vibes. Good food (not amazing) although it came out cold. On a Saturday morning my party of 2 arrived @ 11am Â and was seated @ 1210. We were #26 in line to be seated with many parties of 2 before us. Personally, I thought our wait time was to be expected so no gripes there. I was able to add my party to the waitlist using the Yelp waitlist from the comfort of my car which kept me informed. I could see exactly where I was on the waitlist with live updates. 4 stars because the food was on the cold side, no special excellent flavors & my omelette was messed up. They did recook my omelette making it a top priority and getting it back to me hot and quick due to the mishap.
