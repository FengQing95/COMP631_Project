JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I think Jinya has the best ramen in Houston, I can't wait for the one in Katy to open. I like that there are so many different toppings you can add to your ramen. The restaurant is nicely decorated, the staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I wouldn't recommend for a date night or for little kids because the music loud in the restaurant is loud. Be prepared to wait or ask to eat at the bar if you are in a hurry. It's worth the wait.
