Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////as for the BLANDNESS ... i don't have a diplomatic way of saying it but at this price point, if your cooks don't know how to season food while cooking, those kinds of hiring decisions are going to catch up with you.  this area of houston is a world-class market, you're swimming with sharks.  barbacoa was dry, eggs were clearly not poached in salt water, and try thickening the hollandaise a bit to concentrate it's flavor.
