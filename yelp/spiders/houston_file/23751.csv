Uchi////Uchi has to be hands-down my all time favorite restaurant. They achieved every aspect perfectly. The ambiance upon entering is warm, inviting and intimate.

The food is just delightful, perfectly prepared and wonderfully presented. It is the best sushi and nigiri (I believe that's what it is called I have had.
