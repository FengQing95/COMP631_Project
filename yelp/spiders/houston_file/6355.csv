JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love Jinya, well priced and delicious! If you come at night, expect at least a 20-30min wait. If you have a big group (more than 4) try to go when they are not busy, the midtown location is small so the wait for big groups can be ~60 min when they are busy. It's definitely worth it though The spicy miso ramen is delicious! Definitely try the shrimp balls as well, they are so yummy!!!
