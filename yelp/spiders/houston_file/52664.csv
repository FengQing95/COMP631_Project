Kata Robata////With the rave reviews already being said, the only thing I have to add is if you like Toro this is the place to be.  For my first time, I had the sexy scallop roll, crunchy eat roll (for comparison against my fav roll at kubo's), toro roll and a couple of pieces of toro.  Awesome toro.
