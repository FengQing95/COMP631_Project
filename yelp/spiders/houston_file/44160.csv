Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I found out about this bakery after searching for cruffins. There are no cruffins but I thought I would try it out anyways. The atmosphere is really nice. Feels like a cafe you could sit at and chat with friends or family. There is a line for the bakery. There is a display that shows all the yummy baked goods, which is nice. I got the Chocolate Nutella Cupcake, Chocolate Chip Cookie with Walnuts, and Kougn Aman.
