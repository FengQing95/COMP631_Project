Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place! All is incredible! From the Nutella croissant to pumpkin, birthday cake, and chocolate macarons, coffee, it's all Aaaaamazing! This Houston spot reminds me of being in NYC! I can't wait to go back and continue to dive in to all of the amazing sweets and gourmet entrees. Congrats to the owner/chef, such a wide variety, and all done well!
