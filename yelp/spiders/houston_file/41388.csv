Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is one of the only places I would definitely indulged in and spend all my money. Everything in the menu looks so appetizing like they want my money so bad, ugh. I do have to say it's very pricey but so so worth it. They have the most amazing cookies I've ever had ever in my life. I wish I was exaggerating. I love their coffee as well. I also recommend their chai latte. I personally don't like chai latte but for some reason I loved theirs. I heard their chef came from France or something that's why their big array of desserts are AHHHMAZING. However, I wish they move to a bigger location or expand their current location because it can get pretty busy so easily. It is also very hard to find seating when it's busy. I also noticed that a lot of college students go there to hang out or study. So it's a good place for that kind of setting as well. I also recommend this place for those coffee meet ups either it be to catch up or for meetings. It definitely lives up to its hype. I can't wait to go back!!!
