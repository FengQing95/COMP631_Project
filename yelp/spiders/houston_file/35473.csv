Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Overall I had a great time when we went. I went on a Friday night prior to the grand opening. I didn't have a reservation but we arrive early and they gave us a table for 3 without a reservation. At first the gave us a table that was way too tall for the chairs. I felt extremely close to the table. But when I asked to be switched, they did switch me and just said I had to be out of there before their next reservation. Which is completely understandable. Just be-careful where you sit. So for the food and drinks. We all ordered a scotch/whiskey drinks (all different) and they were all tasty. Only downside is that we did get there early and yet they didn't have a happy hour. Hopefully that changes as they get busier. Next the food, we got one main dish and two sides. Very tasty. We got the ribs and mac and cheese. And some sort of potato dish. All tasty. I would come back but definitely would appreciate a happy hour if I get here at 5pm. Especially in this area.
