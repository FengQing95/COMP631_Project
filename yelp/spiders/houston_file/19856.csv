Uchi////First off, the only reason I subtracted a star is because of the hostesses. My first time here, I was with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We had made a reservation for 5 or 5:30pm. We were dressed up, walked in the door and waited for SOMEONE to greet us. Out of the 3 people standing there around the computer, no one greeted us even though they looked at us. Then a group of 3 or 4 came in right after us and they were greeted right away. One of the ladies said to the hostess, "I believe they were here before us" and the hostess replied "Oh yes, I know, I got them already." Â So after sending those ladies off, the hostess turns to us, "Hi, just two today?".....WTF. That put me in such a horrible mood and I almost left but because I wanted to try their food, I stuck it through. BAD first impression.
