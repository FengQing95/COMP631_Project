JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually order either the Tonkotsu Black ( my favorite), or the Cha Cha Cha, though I have also had the Sprouting up ramen and the Yatai Ramen ( I don't think this one is still on the menu). I would give this place 5 stars, but sometimes there are slight fluctuations in the and saltiness of the broth, and since Ramen is already pretty salty, this can really stand out.
