Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat did not disappoint. This is my 2nd visit here and I am equally as pleased as I was the 1st time. Today, I had a couple mimosas, the Breakfast in bed shot, the Bosscat fries and the Donut Burger. I thoroughly enjoyed everything, including the shot which contained maple bourbon, orange juice on the side and a slice of bacon. The maple bourbon was extremely thick and sweet and tasted like drinking syrup. Aside from that, all together it was pretty good. Although a very unique drink, I probably would not order that again.
