Uchi////Thank goodness I had Marisa to work with.  She made it a very memorable, smooth sailing, extraordinary event.   The servers were good but could improve a bit on replenishing the drinks and removing each course dishes.  But I think that will come with maturity and experience. With such a high ticket party there should more experienced waitstaff.
