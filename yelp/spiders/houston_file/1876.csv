JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We each ordered different things, and as others have said, the ramen is just salty.  There was not much depth of flavor.  We also waited a long time to place our order although it was certainly busy.  Did not taste authentic or inventive...just salty noodles and some veggies.  Looking forward to trying some other places.
