Kata Robata////My wife and I went here to celebrate our anniversary, and what a night.  The presentations were beautiful, the fish was incredibly fresh, and the atmosphere was sexy.  The place was jam packed, but we had reso's and quickly proceeded past the line to a table (hint*).  The menu is beautiful and fun to create your own tasting menu, I reccomend the collar of fish on the robata with a side of the shishito peppers.  Whatever you choose, you won't go wrong!
