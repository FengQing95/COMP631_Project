Baby Barnaby's////ok, so after many visits, I can confidently say all the food is excellent, and the service good even when gay people haven't just been given the right to marry in NY.  The big square pancakes are almost as ridiculously good as the biscuits, to the point that I make a pig of myself every time I go.  We need this place in Astoria.  Of course, we'll never have anything of the sort, or if we do, the prices will involve an extra digit.
