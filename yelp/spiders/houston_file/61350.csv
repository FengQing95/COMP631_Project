Baby Barnaby's////This is a really nice and quaint spot for a decent breakfast. When you walk up there is a clipboard to sign your name and amount of people in your party and the option to sit inside or outside. The place was clean and the people were nice however, space was limited. My family and I enjoyed our meal but we will visit another location with more space and hopefully the food is just as good. Parking is very limited but people come and go quickly so you don't wait very long for a good parking spot.
