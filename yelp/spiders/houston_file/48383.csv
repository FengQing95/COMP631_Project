Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Like many, I was well aware of the Snooze hype before I even walked in the doors. For those wondering if the hype and the (almost guaranteed) wait at the door are worth it: Yes! The wait is because the entire process from being seated to getting your check is slow. This is a "sit-down and enjoy your meal" kind of place, not a "grab a bite to eat and go" kind of place. You come to Snooze for the experience first, food second. Not to say the food is forgettable (it's not), but your experience at Snooze is slow and methodical. Enjoy your company (if you brought someone; if not, your morning paper), then enjoy your food.
