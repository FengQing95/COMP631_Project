Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend ordered the Snooze Classic and substitued her toast for the Pumpkin pancake. Can I just say..... the side pancakes are HUGE! Bigger than my whole hand. We obviously didn't finish it but I like how you get your money's worth ($4). The pumpkin pancake itself was pretty good.
