Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm always impressed by the beautiful decor and hipster atmosphere. I never knew they served entrees, so was pleasantly surprised to see a breakfast menu. We decided to go for the soft scramble, an almond croissant and a fruit tart. Coffee for him, Earl Grey for her. I gotta say, I was so wonderfully and pleasantly surprised by how creamy and flavorful the eggs were, paired with the perfectly crunchy baguette. The almond croissant did not disappoint, and the tart was just okay (especially for $5.00). At the end of the meal I didn't feel really heavy or gross... just satisfied by a darn good meal.
