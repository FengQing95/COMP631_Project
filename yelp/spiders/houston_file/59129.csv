Baby Barnaby's////This is my boyfriend and I's go-to weekend breakfast spot. We always wait extra for a table outside because the inside is far too loud and always share the same dish: the low-fat protein burrito but made with fat (we add cheese and potatoes). Most importantly the waiters do not hesitate to bring us an extra order of the sides (guac, salsas, sour cream). This is a key to our relationship as we have nearly broken up over condiment sharing issues.
