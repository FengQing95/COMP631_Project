The Pit Room////Forget about what you think you know about Houston BBQ...inside the loop and beyond, The Pit Room is hands down the best BBQ in town. The brisket and pulled pork are the best I've had and their sauces are amazing. The best part is - they are connected to a bar so there is a ton of seating (in and outdoor) and great for college game day.
