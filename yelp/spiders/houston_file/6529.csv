JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Jinya 3-spicy was so so good. I loved it. It's a little better than Tiger Den in my opinion and a million times better than Ninja Ramen. My PIC got the Jinya 2 (spicy chicken ramen) and I wasn't as crazy about it, but he loved it. It tasted a bit like chicken noodle soup.
