The Pit Room////Be aware that The Pit Room is not a cheap place and can be a high dollar lunch/dinner spot, but that is what makes it one of the finest places in the Montrose area. I believe the food along with their service makes this unique spot a 10/10, must-visit. I can't wait for my next order.
