Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food: YES!!! My friend had the Benny Goodman Benedict & I had a half order Ham Benedict III (love that you can order a half portion) as well as a plain pancake with a side of bacon. The cinnamon pancake...is best described as something that you eat as dessert on Thanksgiving right before a 5 hour nap, LOL! But it's not overly sweet.
