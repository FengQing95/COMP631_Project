JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let me say first that the Ramen here is delicious.  I had the Vegetarian Ramen and was great, although the tofu was flavorless and the texture was goopy the rest of it's contents were great.  I eat eggs so the seasoned egg was also great.  The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because I order it to go and in my opinion it took too long considering nothing needed cooking and also because of the price.  It was a tad over priced considering there was no meat.  The space is small and dark inside but nice for a date.
