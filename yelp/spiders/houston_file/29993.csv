The Pit Room////I eat here every time I'm in Houston! I get the pulled pork sandwich and jalapeño chips every time! Their condiments of pickled jalapeños, onions or fresh sliced jalapeños is outstanding! Their bbq sauce is awesome, but I usually don't use it, as the sandwich is good without it! Highly recommend this place!
