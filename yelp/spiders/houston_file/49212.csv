Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Pancakes are so fluffy and flavorful. My favorite one so far has been the peach cobbler (it was a special- please bring it back!) as well as the sweet potato pancake. My boyfriend's favorite is the blueberry pancake. Although the pineapple upside down pancake is a crowd favorite, I took a bite of my friend's and we both thought it was just okay.
