Uchi////I made a reservation online for dinner for me and my husband for my birthday (made the reservation two weeks prior). When my husband and I arrived, the host and hostess politely informed us that I had made the reservation wrong. Â I had actually made a TAKE OUT reservation from Opentable. The host, Santos, and the hostess, Muk, were so kind and found a reservation cancellation to offer to us.
