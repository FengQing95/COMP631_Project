JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've gone back a couple of times and it still hits the spot every time. If I lived closer to Mid-Town, I'd be there on the daily, but it's definitely become the stop to go to when I'm in the Mid-Town area. I recommend everyone to try this place out. I've gone to plenty of ramen places in both Houston and Dallas and this place is by far the best!!!
