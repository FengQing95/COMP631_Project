Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The beet and goat cheese salad was money! I thought it was possibly the best beet and goat cheese salad of my life. They had three types of beets (red, golden and the swirly kind,) leafy sprouts, crushed pistachios, soft goat cheese, crispy croissantinis, and a sweet balsamic drizzle. To top it a off, they sprinkled a spice of some sort all over and it just MADE the dish! It tasted like five spice or cinnamon or cloves. It was sooo good.
