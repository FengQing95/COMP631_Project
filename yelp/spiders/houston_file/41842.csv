Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bright and airy, great coffee. Lots of Beautiful People, which can be a little intimidating, but the staff doesn't put on airs, which I appreciate. I love their brunch / lunch menu, but more than once have forgotten that they stop serving that at a certain time and switch to just-coffee-bar-and-pastries/desserts. Best place in Houston for pastries, for my taste.
