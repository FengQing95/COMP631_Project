Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ordered 3 dishes for brunch: chicken&biscuit, grillades&grits, boudin Benedict.  Good portion size as between my sister, myself, and 2 little girls, we could not finish everything.    Chicken tasted very fresh, the breading was light and crispy, not heavy at all.  Topped with a bechamel and cheese sauce that runs continuously with the over easy egg on top of it, it was decadent. The single giant buttermilk biscuit was larger than a pancake and great to mop up the egg yolk and bechamel mess with.  The grillades and grits were amazing!  Tender stuffed veal sits on a bed of delicious grits smothered in a gumbo gravy.  The boudin benedict consists of a boudin and a fried egg in an English muffin doused in remoulade Hollendaise.  The latter 2 dishes no doubt were influenced by one of the chefs who worked at August Restaurant in Mew Orleans.
