Local Foods////I can't believe I've never written a review for this place because I absolutely love Local Foods! I've come here multiple times since I've moved here and it's always been widely recommended. We come here for hang outs, birthdays, meetings, dates etc. It's really a one place fits all situations type of place. I think it's due to its healthy reputation, clean and accommodating interior, and delicious food.
