Kata Robata////First course was miso soup and agedashi tofu. My friend said that the miso was the best she has ever had. I found it to be very nice too, but I am not really one to rave about miso. The agedashi tofu, however, was one of those starters that really gets me excited about the prospects for the rest of the meal. The tofu squares were crispy on the outside and fluffy and light on the inside, and the sauce around them was delicately sweet. The combination was sheer perfection. I would get that dish again and again. Really, I can taste it in my memory this morning, and it was just divine.
