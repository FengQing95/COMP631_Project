JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I regret that we have extended wait times during peak periods. As far as weekends go, we do get very busy especially before right before Astros and Rockets games. We have a large swath of area sports fans who enjoy getting ramen before or after the games. That said, I appreciate your understanding. I must, however, make a slight correction to your post to say that we do not take reservations. Our seating is strictly first-come first-served.
