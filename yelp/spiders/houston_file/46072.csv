Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is an upscale casual cafe. You stand in line to order your food before securing a table. Be prepared to wait in line for a while and on weekends it can wrap around the building. The parking situation is reminiscent of parking at the malls around Christmas time...good luck.
