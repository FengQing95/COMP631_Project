Baby Barnaby's////- The location is very small on the inside and outside....which means the tables are basically on top of each other and you can hear everything the table next to you is talking about.  To put this in a better perspective - a 1-2 year old child turned around and grabbed a piece of toast of our table (it was a good thing I didn't want the toast).
