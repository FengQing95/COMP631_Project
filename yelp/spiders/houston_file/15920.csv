JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since I wasn't feeling Ramen, I had to venture out. I went with the California Poke Bowl - Regular size. Honestly, it blew my mind. It was super tasty and yummy. All the ingredients tasted fresh. Only downside is I totally could of just gotten the small because the regular was way too big. On the plus side, next time in my wife and I will just share the regular because it's perfect for two.
