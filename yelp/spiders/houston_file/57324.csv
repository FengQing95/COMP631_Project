Kata Robata////If this is Houston's best Omakase/ sushi, then the bar is set really, really low. Perhaps it's because I'm used to NYC, LA, and SF sushi, but given the price, I would definitely have been happier with sushi from the grocery store. Lunch was $100. The nigiri was dry and tasteless. The rolls were blah. The fresh grated wasabi was watery. Not worth it. Maybe if the total bill had come out to $30 I would have rated it 3 stars. But, at $100 for lunch, I expect a lot more.
