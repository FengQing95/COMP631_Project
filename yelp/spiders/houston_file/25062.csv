Uchi////Uchi is our place to go for special occasion dinners for the last 6 years+ and we have always found both the quality and creativity of food amazing.  We normally order Omakase but recently we decided to order from the menu.  The server was very helpful with suggestions and with taking multiple rounds of food orders.  The orders came very quickly and as usual the dishes were amazingly delicious.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating to Uchi is because of the décor and non-uniform temperature control in the dining areas.  The restaurant needs to improve the décor to provide a more elegant dining experience.
