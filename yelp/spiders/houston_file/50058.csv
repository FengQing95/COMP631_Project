Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We could not decide between pancakes or the eggs Benedict. So we decided to get both. I ordered a single smashing pumpkin(I think it's seasonal) pancake that comes with cream cheese dollop I'm the center with a delicious cinnamon syrup. It was the perfect fluffy pancake. My aunt ordered he upside pineapple pancake and she loved hers! Hers come with a cinnamon butter pat on top.
