Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common bond is a great place to have breakfast or lunch with a small group of friends. I went once for breakfast and had the Yogurt Parfait, and once for lunch where I had their 2 ways egg salad sandwich. Both were delicious and very filling: I ate the egg salad sandwich for 2 more meals! The atmosphere is lovely and classy; most people eating there were slightly dressed up. The bakery had a large selection of delicious pastries and macaroons. I tried a croissant and a vanilla macaroon; both were wonderful. My only complaint is that it's hard to get service if you sit outdoors, and it was constantly being bombarded by hungry pigeons. But my indoor seating experience was perfect.
