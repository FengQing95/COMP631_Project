Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We have visited several times since it opened.  Wait time has been between 15-20 minutes each time.  My husband has visited most of the time since I am in a wheelchair, but I went last time and confirm that there are wheelchair accessible ramps that aren't too steep & handicap parking. It was a bit tricky to navigate between chairs/tables, but we did it successfully.
