Uchi////This is THE sushi spot. They really live up the the hype spoken  about this place. I'm surprised how casual everyone was dressed it made the ambiance a lot more comfortable than a strict dress code. We went for a my birthday and boy did they make you feel special. Every waiter who approached our table said happy birthday and they gave us more than one plate on the house which was super sweet! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the chef special signature dish (six course). It left us speechless. Every item was quality and the service was phenomenal. There was a reallly long line to get seated. They mix in walk ins and reservations in the same line which is great but be sure  to make a reservation far in advance because it fills up quick upon opening!
