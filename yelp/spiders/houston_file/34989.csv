Local Foods////Local Foods has been my go-to place to eat out with friends or when I crave something healthy! My og Houstonian friend first introduced me to this place and I cannot thank her enough for it. I am not ashamed to say I eat it every week and I always get the same item, which is the garden sammie salad with chicken. I just love how they cook their Brussels sprouts. Can't wait to try out other things from their menu!!
