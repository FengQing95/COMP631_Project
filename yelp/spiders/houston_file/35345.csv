Local Foods////Pretty good! We got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Quinoa Burger, Harvest Salad, and Salmon Salad. My favorite was the salmon salad - the maple glaze was terrific and the salad was very filling. The vinaigrette was also very good. Will be coming back here sometime! I also love the mini grocery store in the shop.
