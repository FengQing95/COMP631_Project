Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The three stars I give Bosscat are largely for the service - the waitstaff were extremely prompt and efficient in bringing drinks and food, and worked with us to figure out a solution to splitting the bill (they can itemize up to 8 checks; otherwise, they can only split the total evenly). Even the woman I spoke to on the phone to make the reservation went out of her way to accommodate our party, which had a last-minute 2-person addition. But on the basis of the food alone, I wasn't super impressed.
