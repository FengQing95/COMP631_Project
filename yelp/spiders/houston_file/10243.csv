JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the tonkotsu assari ($10), which came with thick noodles. I really liked the broth-- it was rich, porky, and flavorful. After a while though, the broth started tasting really salty, to the point where I couldn't taste any other flavors. I normally like chewy noodles, but the thick noodles were TOO thick and chewy, IMO. The chasu (pork belly) and seasoned egg were amazing!
