Uchi////Legendary! I went to 118 restaurants during my 12-week summer internship in Houston and Uchi was my favorite. We had a reservation but we waited outside for about 20 minutes until we got seated. When we were waiting they served us some sushi samples which was helpful to make the wait shorter. We did the 10 course chef's tasting and it was mind blowing. The fried milk dessert was phenomenal and I still talk about it til this date. We sat at the sushi bar and our chef was very funny. He talked to us during dinner and made us laugh a couple times. It was a super cute and intimate date night. I love this place!
