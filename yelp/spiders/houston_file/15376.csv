JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As soon as we sat down, our waitress asked us for our drink orders and soon afterwards asked for our entree requests. I decided on the Tonkatsu Black with the chicken karate and salad sides while my husband opted for the pork chashu. I enjoyed my choice. My husband liked his but thought that his meal was a little salty.
