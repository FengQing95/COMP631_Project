Kata Robata////*Cons: The register girl was on the phone when I was coming. So, no greeting and 10 mins for the waiting of her talk ! *-*. The waitress left us the menu quickly, said nothing and disappeared. I was hardly to find her and gave her our orders even tho the restaurant was not busy at all. Me and my friends has total 4 dishes ( we were kind of so hungry *-*) and after we finished our first dishes we even have to borrow the next table to leave them there. The staff came out with the food but never picked up any empty dishes. Neither saying thanks nor goodbye until we got out of the door.
