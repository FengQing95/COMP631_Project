JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here for one of our very first dates and still remember the taste very well. It was a super busy ramen joint on a Saturday night. Tables were waited on a first come first serve basis. The restaurant was small, but very cozy and contemporary looking. Though we waited almost an hour to get a table for 2, our food came out pretty quickly. For some reason, the eggs didnt have much flavor that night but ramen noodles and broth were really tasty. Our spicy ramen bowl was a bit too spicy for us, but overall tasted very rich and flavorful; they were not super salty as some ramen bowls could be.
