Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I get it they're popular. Checked in at 10 for four told an hour and fifteen wait. No problem. They text and you can leave. So we ran some errands. The issue is once you sit down. We waited more than 40 minutes for breakfast. I'll never understand that. Bfast tables should turn quick. The food is great but they need to figure out the glacial pace of order to food delivery. Service is friendly but sparse, which I get. It's breakfast. It's not dinner so you get a bit more relaxed and I'm good with that. The pineapple upside down pancake is amazing. It's not 3 hours of your day good. We left at 1pm....
