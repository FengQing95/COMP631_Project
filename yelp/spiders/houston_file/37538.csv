Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried Bosscat for dinner and overall was not impressed. The cocktail I had was (The Bosscat) was quite good, but that was about it. The Pulled Pork Hushpuppies were a little lackluster. The pork was a little tough and did not have much flavor. We had the Brick Chicken and Short Ribs for entrees. The Brick Chicken, which was recommended, was very basic. It was a small generic chicken breast with dirty rice and broccoli. There was an absurd amount of rice that was too salty and only a couple pieces of broccoli. The Short Ribs also seemed to have nearly no flavor. I think this place is worth a trip for drinks, but I would not go for a meal.
