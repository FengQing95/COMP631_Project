Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First timer here and the food and drinks were fantastic. The service was fast and the servers were so nice. We even had the pleasure of meeting Tai, the owner, who was so down to earth and chill you would have never guessed who he was. We had the poutine for apps and oh my the fries were crispy and soft! (Like how?! Hahaha) I had the steak- seasoned perfectly. And my fianc√© had the beef ribs which were so soft it melted in your mouth. Our table shared the mac n cheese (so delish) and okra (with Chinese sausage- brilliant!). We all enjoyed the ambiance, food, drinks and service. Definitely going to return when we're back in town.
