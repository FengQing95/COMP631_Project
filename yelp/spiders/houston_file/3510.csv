JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love noodle soup of all kinds, and ramen is no exception.  However, Jinya's creations are often too salty and somewhat forced.  Any ramen or noodle soup lovers know it's all in the authenticity of the broth.  So when a restaurant's soup base isn't flavorful and developed enough to carry the rest of the ingredients, it shows.
