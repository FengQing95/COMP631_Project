Uchi////We've had the opportunity to travel to Houston for a couple weddings & Uchi came highly recommended from one of our brides. I'm glad we took her recommendation. Though, if you don't make reservations -- you're going to wait. For a long, long time. (Don't let this discourage you. You'll forget the wait as soon as you get your food.) And if you're impatient like me, head over to the coffee shop next door and get a beer.
