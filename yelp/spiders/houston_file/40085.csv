Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We have been here a handful of times and I'm so glad we dropped in tonight! The atmosphere was nice, noisy enough to have private conversations but not so noisy that you have to yell at one another lol. Our food was perfect, hot, fresh & delicious. The best part is they make MOCKTAILS! #Sober! Also we had the pickles and veggies and fried mushrooms for our appetizer. Let me tell y'all-- GET THE CATFISH! It was seasoned perfectly and I asked them to fry it extra crispy which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Our server spent the right amount of time checking in and out with us! And my husband had the brined pork chop! It's a center cut thick cut, looked great! Mac and cheese was lacking flavor.. they may use water instead of chicken broth . All in all. We will be back!
