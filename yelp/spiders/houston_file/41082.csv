Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love the ambiance and decor.  Came at around 2 PM with an extreme craving for a chocolate croissant, after recently visiting Paris a few months ago.  However, they only had 3 desserts left, none of which were chocolate croissants.  I was told they sell out pretty quickly in the morning.  Their breads and other pastries were pretty good.  Given that it's walking distance to where I live, I'll probably frequent here often.
