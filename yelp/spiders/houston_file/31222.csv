Local Foods////Went after work for dinner, Â only two tables had other people, and they sat us at the closest table to restrooms. Literally 5 feet from them. Constantly shooing flys away while eating, one even landed in my drink, food too mediocre for the price, waiter said all margaritas were happy hour price but then charged us for regular price. Overall not worth the money. Would never go back.
