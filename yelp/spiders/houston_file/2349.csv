JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I'm sorry to hear that your ramen was similar to "fish oil vitamin".  I know what you mean by that being that my mother use to give me that when I was a kid and I would chew it since I didn't know how to swallow pills.  May I ask I which ramen you ordered?  Jinya Ramen offers 11 different kinds of ramen and each and every broth is different.  The Cha Cha Cha and Tonkotsu Black are by far the thickest broth and thus high in oil content.  Many of our Japanese customers prefer oily broths since they are comparable to the ramen they serve in Japan.  As for myself, I can't digest anything too oily so I go with the Yatai ramen and the Tonkotsu Assari.  The Yatai ramen is a clear veggie and chicken based broth.  It's similar to your typical Shoyu ramen.  The Assari is a mixture of pork broth and light broth.  I feel the combination gives it a very good balance.  Jinya Ramen is very new to Houston so we are learning that it will usually take a typical guest 2 to 3 tries to find the ramen that best suits them.  I hope you give Jinya another try in the near future and please feel free to ask the server for recommendations based on your personal preferences.  We can even custom make your ramen for you based on your suggestions.  If at anytime you find something not to your liking, please send it back.  We will be glad to replace it or make you something else.
