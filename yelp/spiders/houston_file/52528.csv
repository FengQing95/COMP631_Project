Kata Robata////Started with maguro, toro, bincho maguro, which were all of melt-in-your-mouth buttery quality. I normally prefer salmon, but Kata may have won me over with their tuna. Nice hot sake to top it off. The caribbean roll was delicious. The california roll was just so-so. We ended with a mouth-watering uni special entree, but I forgot what it was called. Overall - good service, presentation and ambiance. $100 out the door for 3 during happy hour. All I can say is: you get what you pay for :)
