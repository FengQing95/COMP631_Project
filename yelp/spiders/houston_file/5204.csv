JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////i loooove jinya ramen bar. so delicious. i always get the spicy chicken ramen & add chicken sabbaro, corn, cabbage, nori, seasoned egg & extra broth. the soup is so flavorful, i could literally eat it everyday..(not kidding, i've eaten it 4 times this week). also the salmon poke mini tacos are so good. put extra lime on them. no complaints about jinya. 5 stars all day
