JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I like the original location better for some reason. The food was good but was missing something je ne se quois, I would come back to this location because it is somewhat closer to me. This place is not your typical japanese ramen joint, its a fusion place so don't expect naruto and other stuff you see in japanese ramen. Â Overall i LIKE IT , but I prefer Tiger Den if it was a showdown of japanese fusion ramen.
