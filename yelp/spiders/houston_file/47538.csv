Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There has been a lot of buzz this past week about this spot so of course I had to give it a try. I was worried there would be a line out the door, but we were lucky and only had to wait about 30 minutes. I ordered the Ham Benedict and my friend ordered the Breakfast Frittata. Just to spice it up, we added one Cinnamon Roll Pancake. HOLY MOLES YOU GUYS, that pancake! It had the perfect level of sweetness, great use of pecans and a richness from the dark chocolate chips. Don't get me wrong, the egg dishes we were great but the star was that one delicious pancake! The staff was friendly, excited and very attentive. So happy to have Snooze in the neighborhood!
