Kata Robata////Everything during our dinner was spot-on. We started off with the shishito peppers, which weren't as spicy as we would generally prefer, but the kimchi aioli was a great way to bring out a more unique flavor profile for the peppers. The miso crusted bone marrow was one of the highlights of the night. Each side topping or accompaniment that was given paired perfectly with the bone marrow to balance out all of the flavors. We finished off with a variety of nigiri, including some amazing o-toro and wagyu a5 that was among the best we've ever had. And the portions for all of these items were more than generous. Top that all off with the very fast and friendly service we received and I would say this is definitely an experience we're looking forward to having again.
