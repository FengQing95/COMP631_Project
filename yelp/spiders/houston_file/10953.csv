JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Inside the restaurant is dim, which I prefer. There are booths, as well as a communal dining table. Their host/hostesses are always smiling and friendly, as well as their waiters/waitresses. Service is always quick and efficient whenever I come here, even on busy nights.
