Kata Robata////From one of the attached photos you can see what we ordered and the cost (what a value!) we started off with a different version of surf and turf... the beef skews (incredible) and grilled octopus at the waitresses recommendation. She called the beef skewers "beef butter" and this dish is simply haunting (in a good way... I've been dreaming of it ever since and you will too!)
