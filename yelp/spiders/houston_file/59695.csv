Baby Barnaby's////I went here for breakfast and did not think the food was anything special but the reason why I am writing the post is to warn parents not to bring their children here. The place is cramped. I asked for a high chair and they said I could only sit at one of two table available. Then they said that the waiter will get the high chair for you. I waited and waited but no high chair. I asked about it and she said she was busy and I needed to get it myself. I would have done that in the first place if they had not said your waitress will get it for you. We bring the highchair to our table and when we place our baby in it we see the plastic fastener is broken.
