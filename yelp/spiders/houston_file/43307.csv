Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I did not see anything too appetizing from the actual menu, so I ordered some items from the bakery. I ordered the Kouign Amman, which looks like a muffin, but it's sort of like a croissant with layers of butter and sugar inside! This was pretty good. It was hard to cut/bite into, so I would not recommend it if you are on a date, and trying not to be a mess ;)
