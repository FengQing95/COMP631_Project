Uchi////Great presentation, just not what I had in mind.  I came to try their escolar and a few of there rolls.  At first they didn't bring soy, Ginger, or wasabi with the roll; as though it's a sin to.  I felt to deviant to even dare to ask.  They brought out a special sauce with my first roll, basically a flavored mayo lol.  I tried there escolar special, also was ok and frankly tasted over cooked.  I tried a yellowtail roll and again under impressed.  It took 3 plates, two rolls and the escolar to make it a meal.  Bar tender told me its normally 3-4 dishes per person.  Based on my bill, prepare to spend over $150 for dinner for two, that would include a glass of wine and desert.  For the money, just seemed like an average place.
