JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tofu traditionally absorbs the flavors of the foods it touches in a dish. Also, please know that you can request "less salt" or "less oil" for any of our ramen dishes. Otherwise, I'm pleased to know our service was good, and that you were able to use the free parking garage. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
