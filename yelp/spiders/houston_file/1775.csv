JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////However, as I sat finishing off my bowl, I was struck by how much about Jinya seemed off. To put it bluntly, the place is too corporate. This is to be somewhat expected, it is a chain albeit a small one. In my opinion, ramen is the Japanese equivalent of pub food; big, greasy, filling, piled with flavorful toppings, and not too expensive. When you look at the menu for Jinya though, everything is just a bit too pricy; none of the ramen bowls go for under $10 (with all the signature bowls hovering around $13 before additions), and the appetizers are similarly pricey ($4 dollars for a single steamed bun!). Jinya's a lot like that that type of pub that think's charging $15 dollars for a hamburger is okay because they use white cheddar cheese instead of American.
