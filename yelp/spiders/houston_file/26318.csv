The Pit Room////3 stars over all but only one star for the pork ribs...extremely dry, tough and not very flavorful. The house-made cheddar jalapeno pork sausage is ok, but the cheese is distributed in big chunks which I didn't like at all. The green beans were good and the potato salad was delicious. The line was deep but moved quite fast. The staff was very efficient and friendly. If I go back, which is unlikely, I'll try the brisket.
