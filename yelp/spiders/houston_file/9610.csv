JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I probably will never have the Cha Cha Cha again due to one bad experience butttt my vegeterian regime has made fall in love with their spicy vegan ramen Â now ask for thin noodles, fresh garlic, spicy bean sprouts anddd their seasoned egg. Omfg. Best combination ever and I can never finish the darn bowl!
