JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only downside is that Jinya is so popular there is almost always a long wait. In my experience, it has been nearly impossible to get in on a weekend night (without waiting at least an hour). The best times to go are at odd times/weekdays. Furthermore, to accommodate this problem, Jinya uses communal-style seating for much of the restaurant. While this is fine for 2 people, it is disastrous when your group gets stuck sitting in one row and can't talk to each other. This seating and crowding situation also makes it difficult to hear or intimately interact in general. My suggestion for maximum enjoyment here is to come with only 1-2 other people (not in a large group) at a less popular meal time.
