Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was tasty. A bit overpriced but still fresh and good. Maybe the price wouldn't have been as noticeable if my overall experience was better. My issue was the customer service. The Montrose location needs lessons on smiles, how to refill water cups, frequency to check on guests, and ensuring what the customer order is what the customer received.
