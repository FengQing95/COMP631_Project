JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Should you ever decide to return, ask for me and I will be glad to prepare you a bowl of ramen suitable to your taste preference.  Granted, it won't be the little packets of noodles you are normally used to, but I'll create something that will definitely be to your liking.  The uniqueness of Japanese ramen is the many different varieties in broths, noodles and toppings that can be put together to create something that will suit every palate.  Broths can be mixed in different portions to create the perfect balance of taste and thickness.  I'm in the restaurant quite often so if you do come back, please ask for me.  I would love to create or help you find something to your liking.
