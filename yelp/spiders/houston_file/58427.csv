Baby Barnaby's////It's a Barnaby's I don't hate, so that's a plus. I think they should make all the Barnaby's this kind, because this is some good breakfast. The coffee comes smelling divine, and the eggs are that kind of cloudy consistency that just screams for some salsa, which is provided, assuming you ask. Sausage comes in a couple of animal choices, chicken being the surprising star here. French toast is not bad, as is the breakfast tacos. Their corn beef hash, however, must be what disappointment tastes like.
