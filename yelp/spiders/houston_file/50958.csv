Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This spread is everything the sweet potato pancakes were so delicious. The hash brows were  full of flavor and the signature chicken pan sausage was not what I was expecting it was better. The shrimp and grits were also a great choice.  The grits were cooked perfectly. The shrimp was tender and flavorful.
