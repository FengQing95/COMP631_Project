Uchi////The last item that they brought out was truly a humbling experience. I love to cook at home, but having this, I realized I would never be able to make something as good without dedicating my career to it. Chef Daniel had brought out a seared salmon with a curry sauce and microscopic rice puffs. If you've ever cooked salmon before, the rule is usually to cook it mostly on the skin and finishing it in the pan on the flesh side. Once it's fully cooked, it tends to get a bit tough. The skin on the salmon was super crispy while the salmon was succulent, juicy, and had a soft, tender texture. I'm going to say it now, but I think that the only way you can possibly (key word is possibly) have anything better is if you fly to NYC and go to Le Bernadin. I tried probing a bit when he visited our table. My first thought was that he must have used a sous vide. But his reply was that they didn't, just seared it really well :/. I don't know at this point, probably witchcraft is involved.
