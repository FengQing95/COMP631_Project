Local Foods////Two sides are included with your sandwich of choice. that I usually get is the cole slaw and kale salad. Succulent greens! I think they season their food just right. Other recommendations I get at LF are the truffle egged sandwich and the crunchy chicken! They are a supportive vendor of local food businesses like BEER (Karbach, Buffalo Bayou, etc). You can find bravado spice hot sauces and Ca Phin caf√© sua da on the regular.
