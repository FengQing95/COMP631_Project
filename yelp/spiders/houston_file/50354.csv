Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The biggest con was the whole establishment seemed very disorganized. Considering the consistent wait time, there was no where to sit and wait. There's corn hole just outside the steps of the restaurant and they have a couple board games inside. But without anywhere to sit or even stand because of the undirected crowd those are a bit pointless. When we did get called back to our table, we waited an additional five or so minutes Â standing with the inside crowd at the front for a table to be cleared. The hostess' couldn't keep track of who was who and tried seating us with another party.
