Uchi////It's by far the best sushi I've ever had in my life. I can honestly go on and on, but no words can justify what my tastebuds experience when I'm there. Just go. And thank your lucky stars you don't have to drive all the way to Austin anymore (yes, I've done that before. I've driven all the way to the ATX just for social hour. The dog sitter thought I was cray.)
