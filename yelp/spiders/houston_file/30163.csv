The Pit Room////This is exactly why I came to visit Houston, to try some exceptional southern BBQ! Got take out from this place for dinner. Tried the brisket, pork ribs, pork jalapeño sausage, mac n cheese, mustard potato salad, green beans and elote! The brisket was extremely tender and melted in my mouth. It's probably the best BBQ brisket I've ever had.  They also gave a good amount of meat, unlike some other places I've been. Surprisingly the green beans were unlike anything I've had before and had quite a kick to it. I recommend ordering it. I wish I could had more of the potato salad and elote as well which were yummy. Even the piece of bread was good as it was very soft and fluffy. If I ever come to Houston again, I would like to do in-person dining because this place is amazing!
