Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Definitely good service and ambience if you like a younger trendy crowd. Not sure how the food here has rave reviews?! It's pretty mediocre at best. (Maybe those that find seasoning other than black pepper "spicy" think otherwise... ) We found the food to be bland and underwhelming. Â The portions are also not congruent with pricing. I guess it depends on how high your standards are. The bar does offer a nice variety of specialty cocktails so it's a great place for drinks. With somewhat pricey offerings, their happy hour selections aren't very robust. If you're a foodie I suggest you plan for bites elsewhere.
