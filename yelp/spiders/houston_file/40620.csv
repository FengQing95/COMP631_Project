Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been here a few times over the last year and I've figured that your experience really depends on when you go. Brunch is fun, the setting is great and they'll open up the garage-style doors when it's nice. Brunch also has good selection of dishes, though their "signature" (waiter's word) dishes like the chilaquiles were not very flavorful (and soggy) and the fruity pebble french toast was much sweeter than anticipated (and we definitely anticipated it). But I think the brunch cocktails are great! During the week, availability is not so crazy and the happy hour specials seem great. However each time we've gone to happy hour, and early enough, we're told that at least two items from the food and drink menu aren't available (we've gone to try the short rib grilled cheese three times and still haven't been able to). So far, there isn't an appetizer we've tried and haven't liked - during both brunch and weekly menus. As someone who doesn't really like fries, I always order theirs (crunchy outside, soft inside). But as someone who always order Brussels sprouts, I don't order them here (way too much crumbled bacon, not-melted-enough cheese, and soggy sprouts). The kale salad is delicious and the shaved pork chop sandwich is different but tasty. Overall, I think ambience beats the food, but you can find really good dishes to stick with that'll keep you returning.
