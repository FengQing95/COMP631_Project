JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been following the news of Jinya Midtown's opening through its many, many delays, so I'm thrilled that good, easily accessible ramen has finally arrived. I'm used to tiny, cramped ramen shops with barebones rustic Japanese decor, so I was quite surprised to see how beautiful and spacious this place is.
