JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was a casual afternoon on a weekday and so the wait was nonexistent. We were seated right away. Our group had ordered the cha cha cha ramen, spicy chicken ramen, JINYA tonkotsu black ramen and the takoyaki. I was a bit disappointed with the takoyaki. First of all, it's hard to mess up takoyaki at the restaurant - I am assuming that most places use the pre-made ones from the bag and so the flavor is pretty consistent across restaurants. The takoyaki ball itself was good. I find aesthetically unpleasing to see the takoyaki ball sitting in a pool of Japanese mayonnaise. The mayo had clotted up and it was kinda just ughh.. 6 takoyaki balls costed $10....
