JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy Chicken Ramen, level Spicy, was on point! Mild wouldn't have been enough and Hot probably would've melted our tongues! Also, Tokyo Yatoi Ramen was the best of both Chicken and Pork worlds. Pork Gyoza as an appetizer suggested by our waitress ,was hot, steaming, and delicious!
