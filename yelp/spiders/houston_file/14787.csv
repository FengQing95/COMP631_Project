JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was great. Very lively and loud. We did not wait long for the food to arrive. I do have to say though, that this is not the place for a party of 5 or more. We had to wait 2 hours to be seated. It's better for 2 or even 3. Customer service was excellent! I would come back again in a smaller group.
