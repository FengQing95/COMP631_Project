The Pit Room////Came here for take out at lunch time at 12:45 they were still not sold put thank god! I'be read alot of reviews about this place & especially there is not much restaurants we can try near our Area so this is a great spot. I ordered Sliced Brisket Sandwich with Coleslaw on the side total of $12.93. Sandwich: the bun was perfect & Â the brisket was tender but i didnt like the smokey taste, & it was dry not juicy nor oily they give u a henerous amount, but it doesnt taste ruch or unique BBQ. Sauce: I will swear on the Quran that it is Marinera Sauce with BBQ sauce looool I swear to god, it had nth to do with BBQ sauce kim sry. Coleslaw: a different taste but very light & good i luved it especially that freshly ground black pepper on it. Ppl were friendly there & smiley, it looked clean & cozy. I gave it a 3 star for meat quality but it gets a 2 star for the taste. The Brisket House is where u need to have juicy brisket im just sayinn this is mot worth it
