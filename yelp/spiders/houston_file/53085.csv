Kata Robata////By this time, we are feeling pleasantly full and forgetting about the calamity of errors.  Then the waitress begins to clear our table and knocks the soy sauce all over me.  I now have had a soy sauce bath and my shorts and shirt are soaked in soy sauce.  Fighting the embarassment and my flushed face, I wipe the soy sauce off.  The waitress repeatedly apologizes and offers to pay for my dry cleaning. I decline her offer and the soy sauce came out of my clothes.  The waitress then asks if we would like to order dessert.  By this time I just want to get out of the restaurant.  Even after the soy sauce incident, management still does not come to our table.  Worst customer service I have ever experienced.
