Local Foods////Their menu has several interesting menu items such as "Truffled Egg Salad Sandwich," "Duck Confit Sandwich" and "Gulf Shrimp Blue Crab Sandwich." I was feeling seafood and so I chose the "House Smoked Salmon Sandwich - Â local greens, onion jam, cream cheese on a poppy bagel " which includes two sides or soup. $11, not bad. I was pretty intrigued by the onion jam for some reason. But disappointingly, the taste didn't quite come through for me. Not sure if it's because cream cheese overpowered or if they didn't put enough. Or maybe they left it out entirely... and if they did, I honestly wouldn't have known. The salmon wasn't quite smoked as I had hoped, but I will say that it was fresh and I very much enjoyed it. They didn't skimp out on the salmon either! The only thing I would have added to this sandwich was capers. And believe me, I heard two other people from my party say the same thing. It was definitely missing that extra zing.
