Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here on a Wednesday afternoon. I didn't get a chance to try any of their pastries because all I wanted was croissants and by the I came it all ran out. I managed to snag a sucre brioche and a caramel latte. As a big caffeine, the coffee here is legit. The aroma of coffee and baked goods sure is relaxing. I really like the look and layout of Common Bond. High glass ceilings and community tables are a cool concept too me. I'll have to come back with my fiance for brunch.
