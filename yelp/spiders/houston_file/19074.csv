Uchi////All jokes aside, this is my favorite restaurant in town. Fresh food, great fusion of dynamic types of ingredients, stellar service that will keep you on your toes but never intrusive. View this restaurant as an all inclusive experience -- drinks, food, ambiance, service. Not your typical "$1.99 california roll" establishment and will open your mind to try new things.
