Kata Robata////I have two words for you, Texas Hamachi. Damn that roll is good! It might be my second favorite roll of all time. Came here again, and I am still impressed with the creativity of this restaurant. There are so many things I still want to try. My dining partner had some noodles, and was raving about them. Its not the cheapest place, but its worth it if you are willing to pay a couple extra bucks.
