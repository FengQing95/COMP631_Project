Local Foods////This place was horrible the food is not good at all I came here with co workers we both got deli sandwiches omg they are not good the meat had black dots inside and we asked what this was and nobody wanted to comment I question the room temp of the food. Asked for a manager we were lied to by the cashier I think her name was Becky she was rude horrible attitude found out there was a manager there the whole time the tables were nasty as so were the restrooms just shitty horrible service I will not come back and I don't recommend any one else to eat here pass this trash can up trust me you will be so angry coming to eat here please pass up this eatery
