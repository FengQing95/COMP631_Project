JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The style's great but, unfortunately, that's about it. "Ramen" people swear that this place is pretty good but, for their absurd menu prices, I just can't recommend it. I've been here a couple of times and the food has been decidedly "meh" each time. Everything's overpriced, including beer, here in my opinion and the concept ends up being more attractive than the actual product they offer.
