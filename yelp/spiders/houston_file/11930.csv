JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jolene - Thanks for the great review. In the future, you might try our Tonkotsu Assari or Tonkotsu White, both of which have a lighter, less dense pork broth. As far as the seasoned egg is concerned, I fear you may have simply received an egg that missed quality control -- we serve and prepare thousands of eggs a day, and unfortunately, we experience a small margin of error in spite of our best efforts to the contrary. In the future, please ask your server for anything that is off, or doesn't seem right. Our motto is this: "If it's not great -- REMAKE." Simple as that.
