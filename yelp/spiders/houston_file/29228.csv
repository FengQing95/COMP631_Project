The Pit Room////We got a 1/2 pound of Pork Ribs, delightfully smoky, tender and succulent. They were cooked just right (el dente, to the bite off the bone!) and flavorful. The BBQ sauce enhanced this flavor without overpowering the spices on the ribs. The Venison sausage was an epicurean dream for a deer hunter like me. The Czech Beef sausage was excellent and tasty. For fun, we tried the Frito Pie as a change from our usual choice of sides. We were glad we did! Frito corn chips covered with cheddar cheese, chili, onions and sour cream. Lots of fun to eat! Then we washed it down with a refreshing, cold Czech pilsner. Excelsior! The Germans may have invented beer, but the Czechs perfected it. Prices were reasonable for food of this high caliber and the restrooms were clean. We would eat there again.
