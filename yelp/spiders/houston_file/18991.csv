Uchi////Most of the Uchi reviews say it best - this place is amazing. Love the atmosphere, love their happy hour selection and their vegetarian tasting menu is to die for. They are even able to make items vegan if requested. The waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Never disappointed when I go. Parking is tough but they do have valet right behind - where Blacksmith coffee is as another option. Definitely make a reservation before coming unless you are okay with waiting 40+ minutes for a table. We have gone many times without a reservation and just sat on their patio with apps and drinks to pass the time without any issues. Food is pricey but not as pricey as we expected when we came the first time but the quality of food makes up for it!
