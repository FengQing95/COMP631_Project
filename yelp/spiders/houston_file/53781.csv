Kata Robata////We had three sushi rolls, the Texan, the king crab and the spicy tuna. All good, but not great. Really enjoyed the Texan. Ended the meal with the lobster Mac and cheese. Which was also pretty good. I have no complaints about anything, just don't really think the quality and amount of food was worth the price. Maybe I didn't appreciate the quality of the fish, I'm no sushi connoisseur, but I've gotten more food of the same or better quality for much cheaper.
