Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////SO delicious. Literally 5-10 min between sitting, ordering & receiving our food. The menu can be changed in any way. These people have BREAD, literally if you ask for options the only kind they don't offer is the green kind. I had the OMG French toast... & OMG! Warm & soft as a cloud. Another server recommended the cinnamon roll pancakes, and I can't even imagine an adjective that can better explain the fluffy amazingly sweet deliciousness. My Friend had the egg white omelette & she raved about it until we got home (15 mins away). The server offered her the green salsa from Austin, and she declined at first but after trying she never picked up the cholula sauce again. Basically, take the servers recommendations! The place is beautiful, a very minimalist style. Parking is a little tough, but if you can parallel take a spot in the front!
