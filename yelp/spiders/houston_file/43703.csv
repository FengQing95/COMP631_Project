Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this place. Great for brunch and dessert and drink. Was first here with friend and we love the burger - I'm not a huge burger lover but I truly enjoyed it. Also the dessert and coffee. Simply perfect:) My only complaint is not enough parking spots... But that's not stopping me from coming back.
