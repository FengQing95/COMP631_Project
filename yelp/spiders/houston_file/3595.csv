JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Angela - Thank you for your great review! I'm happy to know you've enjoyed all of your dining experiences with us. With assistance from our corporate headquarters, we aim to provide new tapas and ramen dishes every month. The most popular dishes, such as the Cilantro Sashimi, will most always remain on the menu or will be offered as an "off-menu" item. Due to constraints of space and availability, we can only print a fixed number of items on our permanent menus. But we'll always have a "Monthly Specials" menu that the host will provide when you are seated. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
