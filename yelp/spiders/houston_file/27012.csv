The Pit Room////This place was exceptional in all aspects. We got the brisket, beef sausage, and turkey which were all amazing. As our sides we got potato salad and pork skins. These were both excellent options. The pork skins come with hot sauce which is a great pairing. This was our favorite BBQ joint in Houston of all of the ones that made the Texas monthly top 50. Very short line that goes very fast.
