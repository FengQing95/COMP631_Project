Uchi////We love Uchi. Their Happy Hour is excellent, but we also love going for special occasions (birthdays, anniversaries, Wednesdays). Aisha, Tony, and Beans are our favorite (although we think Beans no longer works there). I like to start and end my meal with anchovies and avocado sushi combination, and usually like to get an order of the A & A in the middle too (it's delicious (shout out to Beans for putting us on)). We are basically best friends with Aisha and Alesha (sp), whether or not the feeling is mutual is besides the point). They also have delicious drinks, and if you don't know what you want to eat, just sit back and they will make recommendations to your heart's content.
