Kata Robata////This was a little different experience for me because I was out to a large work dinner where we ordered a bunch of different dishes and passed them around.   This allowed me to sample a bunch of items, but the sample sizes didn't allow for great flavor profile.  Overall, it was a very good experience and I would gladly come back here again.  To date, it's my second favorite japanese/sushi restaurant in Houston.  At the same time, it's not in the same planet as Uchi in terms of fish quality, flavor combinations, and creativity of the dishes.  As always, my review is for the food only.
