Baby Barnaby's////We come here literally every time we get a chance and it has never been anything but great. The green eggs is a must have if it is your first time. I usually get the migas. It's not very spicy (which may be a good thing for some people) but other than that its my favorite migas in Houston. The staff is very friendly as well. Very reasonably priced too. Definitely my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Houston.
