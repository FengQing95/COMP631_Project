Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After finally getting a table I had the eggs Benedict- amazing! And the hash browns were really tasty. Hubs got a plate that consisted of hash browns stuffed with two breakfast meats, topped with cheese and two sunny side up eggs... (Forgot the name) Unfortunately they left the eggs under the heat lamp too long and they went from sunny side up to rubbery overcooked eggs. The manager came by and took care of us so no stars deducted :)
