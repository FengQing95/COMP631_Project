Kata Robata////We also got the basics-- spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spider roll. All were pretty ordinary, but maybe b/c we didn't adventure out and try many of the other exotic rolls. The spider roll was mediocre, with the crab meat fry seemed to crispy and the other ingredients in the roll were bland.
