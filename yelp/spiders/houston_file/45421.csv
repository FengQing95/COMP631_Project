Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just went in for an afternoon coffee/tea break and were amazed by the display of baked goods and desserts. I got a pistachio croissant and my wife got a Boston creme something (looked like and upside down cupcake". Both were delicious. The pistachio croissants appearance almost threw me off as it had these Christmasy green strips. Conversely the upside down cupcake looked scrumptious. Happy end to this story as each came through in flavor, texture and freshness.
