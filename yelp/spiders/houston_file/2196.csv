JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let's agree that when it comes to restaurants, Houston is filled with a variety of choices for nearly every cuisine imaginable, the direct result of a free market. And within that free market we are simply trying to do our best. The JINYA Ramen Bar Midtown team comprises more than 50 men and women who work very hard -- just as hard as you do, I can assure you -- to provide a product that many people seem to enjoy. And in doing so, these 50 people are supporting themselves and their families.
