Baby Barnaby's////I've been here a couple times, once getting the Migas, the next ordering the Steak and Eggs. The food isn't anything that I haven't had before, but it sure beats other bfast-only restaurants that don't hold themselves out to be swanky brunch places for fancy housewives (my anger is probably just jealousy).
