Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The presentation was clean, but it left much to be desired. The biscuits were a bit too dry and even the gravy wasn't enough to moisten up the bread. The egg was cooked perfectly and dripped over the biscuits when split open. I was expecting a bit of a kick from the jalape√±o gravy, but it was just a sausage gravy. It was creamy, but needed more of a spice.
