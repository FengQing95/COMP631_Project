JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////my boyfriend got the tonkatsu black with combo of curry rice. the curry rice was extremely boring and forgetful (but it's a ramen restaurant... right?) his broth was over salted, but had a enjoyable distinct japanese flavor. the egg was oversalted, the meat was extremely salty. the noodles were just okay, maybe we can choose a different noodle width? really disappointed with the seasoning
