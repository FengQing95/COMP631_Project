Kata Robata////It's been years since coming here but just moved back.  The sushi and steak were sooo good! The waiter was helpful with getting me what I wanted.  So many bites had me doing the happy dance. The sake that was recommended, however,  we definitely didn't like and came out to be pretty spendy. The cocktail i had was perfect and would love another one.  I'll be back.
