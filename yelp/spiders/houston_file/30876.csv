The Pit Room////Everything was delicious. Big place and we got there right when they opened. Everyone on the line was pleasant. Husband and I each got a two-meat plate: beef sausage and pulled pork for him with coleslaw and potato salad, and I got the brisket and pork ribs with elote corn and Mac and cheese. 10/10 on everything. The sauce was tangy and just the right amount of spice. Like this place was so good I'm tempted to move to the Houston area just to eat this on the regular. Oh and the pickles from the condiment bar were insane too.
