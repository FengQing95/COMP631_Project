The Pit Room////I have only been here once, so I look forward to giving them another chance. It was a Saturday and they were a bit busy, but there were only 3 people ahead of us in line and it took about 15 minutes to get served. Had ribs, sausage, and brisket. The sausage was very good. Ribs were good, but not super tender. I made a mistake and didn't specifically ask for moist brisket. I got fairly tough, dried out brisket. I did see some moist brisket on a few other plates, so I will give it a try another time. Interior is super small and difficult to find seating when busy. I compare BBQ joints to my favorite, Pinkerton's, Â and the Pit Room just isn't there.
