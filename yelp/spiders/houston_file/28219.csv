The Pit Room////I am new to the Houston area and I decided to check Yelp for a good bbq place. When I walked in, I was greeted by Nathaniel who was pleasant and was helpful in explaining the menu. I ordered the turkey which was very moist and had a lot of flavor. I also ordered the pork ribs and they were tough and fatty; ordered the beef and venison smoke sausage and they both were tough and dry; ordered the brisket and it was salty and fatty. For my side dishes had the cole slaw which just tasted like lettuce with mayonnaise. The beans which tasted and looked like refried beans and the mac and cheese was dry and the sauce was just nasty. The cucumber and tomato salad just pass on that. I am so glad I had ordered the potato salad which was decent that was my complete dinner.
