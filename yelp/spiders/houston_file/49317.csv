Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sunday morning breakfast had a1.5hr wait but it was definitely worth it. Games and drinks available while you wait and the staff is extremely friendly. Highly recommend the egg white frittata as a filling yet healthy entree and the corned beef hash which is a mouthful of excitement. For those of you who do not like sweet potatoes, ask them beforehand to not put them in the frittata. The option to select a flight of three specialty pancakes is a must! In order of my favorites from our flight was the Nana's hot cocoa pancake, the pancake of the day (chocolate batter pancake with a chocolate ganache and a chocolate drizzle and walnuts, and the blueberry danish. Last time the OMG French toast was delicious and the benny duo was an opportunity to try two half-orders of scrumptious hollandaise Benedicts with the crispy hash browns.
