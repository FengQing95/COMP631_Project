Local Foods////I love how they use PRETZEL buns and local/fresh/house made ingredients. The Smoked Salmon, Crunchy Chicken, Garden Sammie, Truffled Egg Salad sandwich, Bahn Mi, and Seasonal Harvest Salad are all so filling, flavorful and healthy. All the sandwiches come with two sides or a cup of soup. For sides, I highly recommend the tuscan kale and soba noodles. The seasonal soup is also a fantastic option in the winter, and they switch it up often. For starters, go with the brussels sprouts! I didn't know brussels sprouts could taste that good till I came here. The desserts here are also to die for. Everything about this place - the food, interior, service - is amazing. I'll never forget the time when the server came over to our table and gave my friend a huge chocolate cupcake cause she was having a bad day. Â Local Foods is always going to have a special place in my heart.
