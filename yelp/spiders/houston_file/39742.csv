Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////- Bosscat Burger (Chef's Way): This burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I like my burgers plain jane, but I ate everything that came on this amazing burger. The meat patty was THE perfect meat patty - perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. Jeremy won us over with the Chef's Way when he mentioned the black garlic aioli that comes on it. SOLD. You won't go wrong with this burger!!
