The Pit Room////I went in and up to the counter and checked the menu...a very nice attendant ask me what I wanted. I chose the Beef Rib, Corn and Potato Salad, The put the huge juicy rib on the tray with some butcher paper and the side each in their own container also a nice side of their special BBQ sauce. Slid on down to a very nice and pretty young lady that rang me out. I was very pleased on the price. Only $31.00 for all that with a soft drink included!
