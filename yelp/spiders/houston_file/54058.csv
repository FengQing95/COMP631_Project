Kata Robata////Anyways, Misty never refilled our water, never asked how we were doing. We were all waiting for a good 10-15 minutes to finally ask someone (the older lady) for bowls and spoons because we were sharing a bowl of noodles. The soy milk ramen was delicious I will give them that. We also ordered a roll of spicy salmon but they forgot to plug it in because we had to remind them again since we were waiting on it for a good 20 minute and we were just sitting around because we finished our soup. We then ordered another bowl of soup but it was super hard because we had to get Misty's attention. She was basically ignoring us. Service was horrible. No one cared. The food runner's face looks like she doesn't want to work there. The hostesses sound rude and snobby.
