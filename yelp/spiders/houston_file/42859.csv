Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Speaking of atmosphere - the natural light coming in during our visit (the early part of Autumn) added a nice touch to our brunch. Â It's not too big, or too small - just cozy enough to add warmth in this age of hipster snob feax chic (I love how that phrase rolls off my tongue).
