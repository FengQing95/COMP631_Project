JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We've come so far from Top Ramen. Jinya is a nice spot. I'm not a ramen connoisseur but I think the ramen is pretty good. The servers and bartenders are friendly as well. I prefer Jinya No. 2: flavorful chicken broth, with chicken. The broth isn't too salty. I also like their appetizers, particularly their shishito peppers and spicy creamy shrimp tempura. They also have a pretty good salad.
