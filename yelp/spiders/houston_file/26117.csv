The Pit Room////Tried the turkey, brisket, pulled pork, and venison sausage. All were good. Pulled pork was a favorite for the family. Husband enjoyed the elote, and I enjoyed my green beans (not on the printed menu, but it looks like they offer a seasonal vegetable option). The serve yourself selection of pickled vegetables was nice and pairs well with the smoky and fatty (in a good way) meats.
