Local Foods////Second visit -  the service was terrible.  When a family comes in with two little ones on a Sunday afternoon, please make an effort to offer help with a high chair or two.  I had to wait on the guy sweeping while I carried two chairs to the patio along with the metal order number.  My wife asked to add chicken and substitute out the goat cheese with another cheese on her salad.  When asked what other cheese they had, the guy at the counter said sliced provolone.  I mentioned that this would be for the salad and not a sandwich.  He said, yep I know that sir.  I asked if they had a parmesean and he said no.  I then noticed and pointed out that a different salad had pecorino and could we have that.  You would think from the look on his face that I had just asked him the meaning of life.  I had to ask another employee for him.  I enjoyed the beer selection.  I expect more for a $50 lunch especially when I'm ordering from a counter and doing the heavy lifting.  High hopes but I won't be back unless my employees want to go to the Kirby location near the office.
