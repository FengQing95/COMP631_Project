Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I stopped by on a Saturday while I was in Houston for the weekend. The place is super busy, and most people were taking their orders to go. The staffs were friendly and patient. It took me a few minutes to decide what I wanted to order. The only downside about this location is that it is so small. With the COVID-19 situation, there are not many seat options. You do have the opportunity to sit outside if the weather permits.
