JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Jinya Bun it was delicious as always I've been to the location on 90 this was my first time at the midtown location but the taste was an exact replica. Second thing I had was the Jinya Chicken Ramen it was so full of flavor and delicious but I was disappointed they gave such a small portion I'm assuming because it was a to go order. I took a photo of the portions do you can see no even half the containers as full!
