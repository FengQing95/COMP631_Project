JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This location in midtown is perfect. It's drivable from downtown and open until 2 AM on weekends to serve the late night crowd. There's street or free garage parking nearby. I'm so glad Jinya took over what was formerly Sushi Raku, which was the worst joint I've ever been to. They served me a shrimp tempura roll in which two pieces had NO SHRIMP. Just rice.
