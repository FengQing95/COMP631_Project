Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////But today we both wanted the avacado bacon toast and a kouign.  The kouign were not baked ready yet and we were told since the chef had yet to arrive there was no avacado bacon toast and no soft scrambled eggs!  How disappointing especially since the place opens at 7:00 am and it was after 7:30 am.
