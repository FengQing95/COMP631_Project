Local Foods////I may get my Oakland card yanked for saying this, but the chicken sandwich is better than Bakesale Betty. Actual Houstoners who don't know what I'm talking about, Bakesale Betty is a famous Chicken Sandwich place in Oakland, CA where people stand in line forever for what had been the best chicken sandwich I'd had before having the one at Local Foods. That may not mean much to you, but all of my Cali friends reading this are considering buying plane tickets and are calculating if the 3 hour flight is shorter than the line at BBs.
