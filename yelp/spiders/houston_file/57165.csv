Kata Robata////I ordered the Kobe beef skewers ($18), the Longhorn Roll ($9) and tofu ($5). Surprisingly, the skewers were perfectly tender and marinated perfectly. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I think it was the best out of the 3 dishes that I got. An order comes with 2 skewers and it was enough to almost fill me up. The Longhorn roll was a shrimp tempura roll with freshwater eel and three types of sauce. I thought this dish was okay. Nothing amazing about it but too expensive for the dish. I got the happy hour price, which was $9, but the original price would have been $17. The tofu was soft and hot. It came with mixed soy sauce land was really good as well.
