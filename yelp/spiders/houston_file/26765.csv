The Pit Room////If The Pit Room had been around when I lived in Montrose, it would have been a regular stop. I will definitely try to visit again next time I'm in Houston. We got there fairly late on a weeknight and they were out of a lot of meats - almost all of them. I ended up with brisket (thankfully they weren't out of brisket) and venison sausage. The brisket was great, not too fatty, very flavorful. The venison sausage, which I wouldn't have chosen, was really good too. I liked it better than the beef sausage I got to try later. My only minor quibble would be with the sauce - I thought it was too sweet. Next time I'll try one of the others. The mac and cheese was very good, very rich and creamy. We shared the sweet cream pie, very nice. Service was great, despite the guys being tired as a long day was winding down, several of them thanked us as we went out the back door. Highly recommended.
