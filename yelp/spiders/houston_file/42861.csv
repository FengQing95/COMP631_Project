Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I narrowed it down to the chocolate croissant, and a dish that I cannot for the life of me remember the name of, but it consisted of blackened shrimp, a spicy roumelade, eggs sunny side up, and (* I believe*) an english muffin.  OUTFREAKINGSTANDING.   I had a REALLY hard time sharing this with my husband - call me stingy.
