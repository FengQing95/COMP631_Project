The Pit Room////For all of the hype I heard from people, I was not impressed, especially for the price. It is decent food if your hungry for BBQ but found the brisket dry and the turkey.  Glad I tried but will not be back.  I personally like moist meat and tender meat, not dry, otherwise I might as well go to a chain store.  Parking is difficult if you arrive after 1130. The line did move through quick and they have friendly staff but food is.... well, everyone has a preference.
