Kata Robata////Service: Our waiter was really nice. I did wish he would have come around more to check on us, but I'm okay with niceties rather than overpowering check ins. However, I really appreciated all of the runners who brought over our food. It was timed almost perfect and our food was always described to us with much knowledge and thoroughness. Anytime there was ever an empty plate in front of us, it was politely picked up within seconds.
