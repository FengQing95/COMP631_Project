The Pit Room////Let me tell you, when I bit into that rib, I swear my heart missed a couple of beats.  The powerful flavor of their dry rub; salt and pepper with no sweet, and the moist pork was enough to seal the deal.  I'm pretty sure my employee was wondering why I shed a couple tears because it was just that damn good.  The crunch on the saudage is just right and the brisket was super moist and flavorful with every bite; no sauce needed. My employee got the brisket sandwich and thought it was great too.
