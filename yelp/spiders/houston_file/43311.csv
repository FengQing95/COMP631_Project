Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Since the it's more of a order-as you go through the line type of service, they give you a number stand to put on your table. A waiter came by with two different lattes for my friends. One was in a pretty mug and the other was in a coffee cup. When we asked the waiter which one was which, he said he didn't know and never offered to find out for us. He was kind of rude and just walked away. We had no idea which number corresponded to which latte, because we didn't get receipts from the cashier.  Other than that, everyone else working here  was really nice and helpful.
