Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really like this cafe and bakery! I have gathered many sunday's here with my friends. Great location in case you want to walk around and discover some beautiful antique stores. Â The coffee it's quite good and the pastries are amazing. Pretty cool place very much recommended! It can get pretty crowded but i guess it's due to how nice it is.
