Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When you come in you get in line to order your food. They will give you a number and bring your food out to you. I got the Chef's Scrabble which was pretty good. The cheesy hash browns were the best! I got the drip coffee but I didn't really like it that much.
