Local Foods////The sandwiches are huge, and you can easily split with another person.  The first time I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich, and had enough leftovers for lunch for my husband and me the next day.  The sandwich was really good, but I don't seek out chicken to eat, and only tried it because it was so highly rated by other yelp reviewers.  Honestly, while it was delicious, I don't plan on ordering it again.  Chicken is just my least favorite meat.
