Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Despite the incredibly long line we had to wait in in order to just place an order, I truly loved this place. The ambience was so hip and cool, I felt as though I had waked into an anthropology catalog (completely a good thing!). I ordered the egg and sausage sandwich, black coffee and yogurt. My yogurt was not that great and was overpriced for the amount you received. The sandwich was delicious and full of fresh flavor. Also their coffee was strong but smooth and I enjoy every sip! I will definitely be returning here next time I'm in Houston.
