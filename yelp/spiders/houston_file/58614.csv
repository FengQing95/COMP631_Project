Baby Barnaby's////If you expect courteous service and to be able to get an item customized, don't come here. On Saturday morning I went for breakfast and asked if ythe could do an omelet and NO WE DONT MAKE OMLETS WAS THE REPLY, this is during breakfast and they have all the ingredients to make a cheese omelet.  I asked if I could get another breakfast dish with out one of the ingredients and NO IT IS PRE MIXED.  I guess Lil Barnabys only wants you to have it their way..... So I took the highway to Avalon dinner!
