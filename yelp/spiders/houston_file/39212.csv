Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband our 4 month old and myself had brunch. I wasn't sure if it was child friendly but I called and they said yes I know some places now are more adults and not really family type places but I did see two other children there around 4 and 5. We ordered the fruity pebble French toast which was amazing!! The vegetable omelet was ok didn't taste like much. And the Maui (prolly spelt wrong) meatloaf which was delish Â definitely would like to go back for dinner
