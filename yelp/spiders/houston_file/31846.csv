Local Foods////The sides were so good. If I can get kale like this, I would definitely be adding more of it to my diet for sure. It was fresh, light, and had just the right amount of sweetness with the golden raisins. The hummus was quite interesting. It said that it was served with cucumbers, but unfortunately there were only two little slices of cucumbers with it. It came with some toast points, but I didn't really need the extra carbs (here NY resolutions despite the fact that I'd ordered the most fatten sandwich on the menu...for shame). The hummus texture wasn't completely smooth like other hummus but the chunks of chick peas in it was surprisingly nice. I actually might prefer my hummus this way I think.
