Uchi////You can never go wrong with happy hour here. The scene is lively with great hour prices, delicious food, and excellent customer service. However, save yourself the pain of waiting, make a reservation! With that aside, the sushi and sashimi dishes here are Bomb as well as many other dishes! If unsure what to eat, go for the omakase (chef's tasting menu) or ask your server for recommendations.
