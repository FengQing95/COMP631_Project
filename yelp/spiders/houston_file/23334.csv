Uchi////We had about 15 different dishes presented. My favorites were the seabreem, flounder, pineapple oysters, beef slices cooked on a hot rock, three different cuts of the same blue fin tuna presented on a bowl of ice (this surprised me how different all three cuts were from each other all originating from the same fish!), and the dessert (don't know the name but it was like chocolate Â mousse with cream/ice cream and chocolate crumbles and was out of this world delicious.
