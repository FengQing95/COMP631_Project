Kata Robata////Fantastic!! The Rising Sun was the best roll I have almost ever had. They don't use too much rice so you can really taste the quality fish. And to boot they have Asahi ton tap! Yes! I can't believe I waited this long to try this place out. Best sushi in town! Also best spicy soy ramen I have ever had!
