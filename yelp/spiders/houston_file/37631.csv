Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the poutine for an app and it's one of the best I've had. The gravy was everything and the deliciously fried wedge potatoes week perfect. Our mains were Kentucky Hot Brown and Shrimp and Grits. Â Husband liked his and said it would have been perfect if they used the pork belly. My shrimp and grits were awesome. Shrimp were piled high and delicately cooked on top yummy creamy grits and a red sauce that was balanced with just the right spice.
