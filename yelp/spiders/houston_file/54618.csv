Kata Robata////I'm a little disappointed with the presentation. Decor is simple, waiters are trained to describe it as "family style dining" which is far from the truth given its location and setting. Look around, are there any kids inside? Why would they market it as family style dishes? Their uni and chopped scallops are served in a cheap Asian soup spoon. If I'm paying $6 per bite of sashimi, can't you present it any other way?
