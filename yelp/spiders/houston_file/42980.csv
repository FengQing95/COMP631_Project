Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The Kouign Amman is amazing and my go-to pastry. COME EARLY OR ELSE THIS WILL SELL OUT. It's basically a croissant with a creme brulee-like topping. I wasn't a fan of the "icing," but the croissant part of it was absolutely delicious. It was flakey, buttery, and fluffy.
