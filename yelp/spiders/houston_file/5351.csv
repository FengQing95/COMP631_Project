JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the tonkotsu assari when i dine in with a cherry blossom and takoyaki; also had a tonkotsu black to-go. The broth is pretty good, not as salty as most ramen places have so i like that. Though, the assari was served with thick noodles, i like thin noodles so i like my to-go portion better than my dine-in one. The drink was pretty good and looks cute. Overall, good food and decent price for a midtown restaurant and nice decor inside for the view.
