Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great place for brunch but definitely expect a wait. Went on a Saturday at around 11 am and had to wait about an hour for a table. Their estimated wait time was pretty accurate though, which was helpful. Parking in the lot is almost impossible, so expect to park in the nearby neighborhoods.
