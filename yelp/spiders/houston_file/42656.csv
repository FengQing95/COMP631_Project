Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So we are huge fans of common bond! We have been coming here for while and haven't had any problems. We have even had a small birthday dinner there for my birthday. However yesterday I went with some friends for their birthday and we go at first they were very sweet told my friend happy birthday and even gave him a treat and put happy birthday on the little tart he got. Fast forward to the dinner coming out I had a Texas club and my friends had two steak frites mine came out in 5 min. Their steak frites took about 30 min. They get their steak frites and one of them was missing the toppings on the fries. We bring it up to a employees attention and then she said okay and took it back when she came back it literally looked nothing like the other fries we asked her and she seemed very bothered that we kept asking. She said it's tossed and I guess they didn't want to make the fries the right way. Very disappointed in the way it was handled why would you bring me out two of the same dishes with one missing stuff.
