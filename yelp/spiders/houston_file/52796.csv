Kata Robata////The highlights of our order were the peppercorn salmon nigiri and the tuna carpaccio (a special).  In general, the nigiri and sashimi were better than the rolls.  We ordered the Houston roll and the MS. Snapper.  The Snapper roll was good, if small.  The Houston roll was pretty average, and hard to eat.  Friends ordered the Caribbean roll and were disappointed.
