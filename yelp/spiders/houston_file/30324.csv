The Pit Room////Its rare that I eat brisket period because 99% of the time there is no flavor, but this brisket was very flavorful and the best I've ever had.  The texture wasn't dry at all.  The turkey was also flavorful and moist.  I was really impressed.  What I wasn't completely satisfied with was the jalapeno sausage.  There was not a lot of flavor to it.  In my opinion if it had just a tad bit more seasoning the sausage would be perfect but I did like the kick of jalapeno.
