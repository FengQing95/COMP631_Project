Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came right when they opened for brunch on a Sunday. And, my original feelings for the food stands. It's not really that great. It's relies on being very sweet and/or very fatty, but doesn't really taste good. I had the meatloaf hash and it just tasted like bacon fat. Bite after bite, the same flavor of just straight bacon fat. My husband has the Sunday scramble, and was like "why are my eggs the consistency of super super ground meat and taste like nothing?"
