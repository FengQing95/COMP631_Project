JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Lychee Martini was great, Ramen was amazing, service was mediocre. I will definitely be going back, though and looking forward to trying other items on their menu. Appetizers, small bites and tacos look and sound great. Small establishment so long waits, but the food is worth it.
