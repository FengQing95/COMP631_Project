JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The first time I came here, I was on a date with my boyfriend.  The waiter initially seated us at the long family style table in the middle of the restaurant.  We were seated next to a very loud group who were downing sake bombs. While there is nothing wrong with that, I did not want to be seated with a group of loud strangers while trying to enjoy a date night with my boyfriend.  A two seat booth opened before we ordered so I asked to be moved, they accommodated us very quickly and the service was very good.  The food came quickly and was delicious. Also the waiter was very attentive.  The specialty drinks tasted as if they barely had any alcohol in them, very sweet, probably will not order that again.  One thing is for sure I have never experienced bad service here, no matter how busy it was.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.
