Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love love love this bakery and all the savory foods they have too! I always make it a point to come here a few times in the year, and it (mostly) never disappoints. My friend got a sandwich and said the bread tasted stale but all my other experiences with the food were fine! Also, their pastries are seriously amazing. The Kouign Amann(?spelling idk) is always so nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and perfectly not too sweet either.
