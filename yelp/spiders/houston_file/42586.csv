Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've had several of their pastries: Almond Croissant, Fruit Croissant, Kugelhopf, Hazelnut Brioche....of which the Almond Croissant is by far my favorite. The Fruit Croissant was kind of hard, the Kugelhopf and Hazelnut Brioche were both ordinary in my opinion. And both times we came here, the Hawaiian Royale has been our go to entree (which my husband claims he would pay $50 for). But the menu changes, so there's no telling if it will still be there the next time we go back.
