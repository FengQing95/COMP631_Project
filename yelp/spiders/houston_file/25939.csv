The Pit Room////I've been back to The Pit many times and their offerings never, ever disappoint, but I tried the Beef Rib for the first time last weekend. I just don't have the words. That rib will make me drive from Conroe just for dinner. I'm so so envious of you "inner loopers". Oh, and the art they are gathering is amazing! Truly Texas inspired! Looking forward to seeing what's next!
