Kata Robata////Wow. Words can't describe how fresh the sushi is here. I was amazed by the chefs selection of sashimi and the rolls. Every sashimi was so fresh and flavorful. No need for soy sauce! The rolls were immaculate as well. The atmosphere was cozy and quaint. Our waiter was attentive and amazing.
