The Pit Room////Got the 2 plate dinner (Sausage/Chicken) on a cold Saturday night, unfortunately they were out of the popular meats (no brisket/ribs).  But overall enjoyed the atmosphere and the service.  Chicken was very flavorful and smoked very well, the green beans side were a little over seasoned.    Good selection of condiments available (jalapeños, onion and sauces).
