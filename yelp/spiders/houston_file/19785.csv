Uchi////Had a bunch of dishes (six or seven) - favs were machi cure (japanese "ceviche") and pitchfork (a roll with wagyu). It was a super enjoyable experience and I'd love to come back. Or encourage them to open a place in LA! Great flavor pairings/mixes; Tyson Cole definitely knows what he's doing.
