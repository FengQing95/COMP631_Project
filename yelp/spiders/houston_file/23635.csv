Uchi////I've been so excited to try Uchi for the longest time, especially after reading all the raving reviews of it on Yelp! But overall, my experience here was pretty lackluster and, I felt, paled in comparison to the other Japanese tapas restaurants I've been to in Houston. I have no problem spending a lot on an incredible meal, but I felt there were only a couple dishes here that exceeded my expectations - and when I'm paying as much as we did I want to be wowed.
