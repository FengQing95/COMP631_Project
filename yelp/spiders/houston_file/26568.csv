The Pit Room////We came to visit Houston for the first time and knew we needed to try bbq. This is the best bbq I have ever had. These people were placed on earth to season meat. We had the brisket sandwich, a half a chicken, a pulled pork taco, cole slaw, Mac and cheese and potato salad. All the meat was so soft it was falling apart. The taco was amazing and flavorful and the sides were phenomenal. To say the potato salad and Mac and cheese were good is an understatement. We got here around 8:30pm and they close at 9 however you have the option to go outside and around back and sit outside or in the bar. The bar offers at least 20 beers on tap. They close at 2 am and have plenty of tvs for sports. When we were leaving we discovered two wood burning ovens where they make the magic happen. The neighborhood looks a little rough but it was nighttime and it appears they are revitalizing the area. Would 1000% recommend. ONE WARNING........ I know spicy can be an issue for some. Their bbq sauce is amazing but very spicy and the pulled pork taco was VERY spicy. I loved it but I know that bothers some people. Give this place a shot. Sorry for the lack of photos the look and flavors mesmerized me.
