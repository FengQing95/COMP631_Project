The Pit Room////A total GEM! There's tons of places where you can get BBQ in Houston alone and this place is now in my top 5. My favorite was the jalape√±o and cheese sausage. I was peeking at someone else's table and the frito pie they were having looks so amazing with fresh ingredients (totally trying it next!).
