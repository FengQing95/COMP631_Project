Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So our bread selection was definitely great bang for your buck, but all the other pastries were overpriced, in my opinion. The macarons didn't look that great and cost more than they do at Tout Suite or Dolce Delights. Also the brunch options were pretty pricey, and the dishes we saw other people eating didn't look impressive enough to surpass other pricey brunch places. But to be fair, I didn't actually eat the macarons or the brunch, so that's just an outside opinion - but just saying, if I'm going to splurge on brunch, I'd rather go to a restaurant known for its high quality dishes, like Benjy's in the Village.
