Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food/Service: Our server was very nice and friendly and made us feel welcomed. However the food was simply not up to my standards. I ordered the Old Faithful because I figured it was safe as a first timer. It is standard to have 2 strips of bacon when you order a breakfast platter from anywhere. I was confused when I received 3 halves.. I then asked for salt and pepper and it legitimately took 10 minutes for me to receive it (I had to ask 2 different servers for it) and my eggs were cold by that point, defeating the purpose.
