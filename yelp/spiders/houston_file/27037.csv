The Pit Room////My husband and I shared the 3 meat meal which we picked brisket, pork rib and shredded pork. Brisket and shredded pork was moist and delectable. Not too much of pepper. Ribs could be more tender but flavoring was good. We were sad they were out of jalapeño sausage when we got there. The potato sales was a good side. Coleslaw is a little different, could have used less poppy seeds. I love the station where you can get onion, pickles and jalapeños. To me, it really adds a lot to BBQ. Not a fan of the coffee BBQ sauce but the jalapeño and habanero sauce was yum! Will be back.
