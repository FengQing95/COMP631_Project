Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here during brunch time with my boyfriend, the vibe is so chill there! We were seated right away, toward the back by the room where they have a chair and keep the wines at. The food was alright, but the drinks was where it is at!!! I love have we had waiters no matter what specific section they have would come and make sure we were okay. I will definitely be going back but around dinner time because I had my heart set out for the sweet potato MAC n cheese!!!
