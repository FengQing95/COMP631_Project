JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Takoyaki came out within 5 mins. Boy, this was so delicious!!! It was crispy on the outside a bit, but soft and perfect and hot on the inside with that bite of octopus. An added bonus to this dish is the egg salad it's placed on. That egg salad is the best I've ever had! The cold tofu followed and it was also equally amazing! It had a spice kick to it and the garlic topping made it really stand out.
