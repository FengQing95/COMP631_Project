JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Joyce - Thanks for the review. It's always interesting to read which toppings our customers enjoy, and which ones they don't. For example, the fish powder we use in some of the ramens is definitely a hit-or-miss. As are the bamboo shoots, though one explanation might be that we use fresh bamboo as opposed to canned. The flavor and texture tends to be a little more natural than the more commonly used canned bamboo.
