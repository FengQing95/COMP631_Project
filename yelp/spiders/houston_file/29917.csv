The Pit Room////Very good bbq got the sliced brisket and a brisket taco and a sausage link.. All were very tasty. I got some of the habanero mustard and it had a great spice that hit you and then went away. Has small indoor dining area but they were pretty quick so the place didn't seem to fill too bad. Brought the extra BBQ back and the family agreed that I need to get more next time.
