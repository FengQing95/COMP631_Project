Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is perfect for brunch! The bottomless mimosas and one entree works for a boozy Sunday with your friends. The bartenders are always attentive and fun to chat with. I love when the weather is nice out and they open the big windows. Try to get a reservation or wait for a spot to open at the bar. This is my go-to brunch spot and they haven't disappointed yet!
