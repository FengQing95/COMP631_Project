Uchi////I went for my birthday with a group of 11 people on a Wednesday night - with an 8:15 reservation.  We got there early at 8pm and were missing one person, so they told us that they wouldn't seat us until our whole party had arrived - "modern fine dining" was the term so snidely used by the hostess.  We had everyone there by 8:20 and they couldn't seat us because the table wasn't available - 20 to thirty minutes we were told.   The restaurant and the bar were packed, there was no where to stand or sit while we waited.
