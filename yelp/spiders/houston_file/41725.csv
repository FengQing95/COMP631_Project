Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The staff is always friendly and the pastries are always delicious. I love their macaroons and croissants. The vanilla latte and black tea always taste good and it's served hot , beautiful latte art as well. Definitely a coffee shop/bakery worth checking out !
