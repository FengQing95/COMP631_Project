Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Been here twice for lunch. Both times found the food excellent, great selection of beers and other drinks and good service. Love the location and the decor inside. Great when the weather is nice outside as they have the type of walls near the door that can open up and give an enclosed patio kind of a feel.
