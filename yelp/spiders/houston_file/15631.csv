JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love ramen and I'm glad there is one closer to us on this side of I-10 now. I've been here twice and the food has been delicious every time. The only thing I have never loved about Jinya are the noodles. They're good but they're not great. And when you order add ons for your ramen you get enough for four people which is great If you have four people but I've never been with that many people. Good spot and good food. Fast service.
