JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were surprisingly pleased with our cocktails, too.  My daughter got the margarita, and we were both surprised at how strong it was because it looked like it would be extremely sweet.   And I give two thumbs up for my Old Fashioned with Maker's Mark.  So many places can mess this drink up, but the bartender was on point!
