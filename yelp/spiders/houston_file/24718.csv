Uchi////Just had to give a huge shoutout to the hostess at the door! I went to pick up a gift card and she was beyond helpful! Very knowledgeable and excelled in customer service! Made me feel very welcome and that she was happy to be there. I had. Long day and she was just very refreshing and made my purchase and pick up so easy. Can't wait to dine in soon!
