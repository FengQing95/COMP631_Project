Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm hoping it was just a bad day, because I have been to another location in another city and it was quite a bit better. The hash-browns were crispier, the food was warm and not room temperature and the entire staff was way friendlier and went out of their way for us. The staff here seemed indifferent and didn't explain things like the other location did. Basically the staff at the other location treated us like a 5 star restaunt and here we felt like we were kinda at Denny's.
