Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great experience. We both had Monday night steak night. The price was really reasonable for a large steak with all the fixings. The service was excellent. Decor is rustic and fun. The venue is a little loud so if you have older guest with you. Â This may not be good option. We will be back for sure.
