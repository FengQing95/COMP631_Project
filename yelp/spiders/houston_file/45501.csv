Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////DRINKS: I was pretty tempted with the OJ, but that cup was tiny and I really didn't want to pay $4 for it... unless it was refillable. It is fresh-squeezed though! The cappuccino came complete with latte art and tasted pretty decent. It did the job of cutting through the sweetness of my treats that I was stuffing myself with. My hubby who also came had his hot coffee, which did the job for him.
