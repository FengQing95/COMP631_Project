Baby Barnaby's////1. I ordered the Pork chops and eggs. I can't really grade easy-over eggs b/c it's an egg. I really haven't had a bad egg...ever. For the pork chops, they actually had flavor -- w/ a lightly seasoned-pepper based coat. Although I didn't love the pork chops, I thought they were the best I ever had for breakfast pork chops.
