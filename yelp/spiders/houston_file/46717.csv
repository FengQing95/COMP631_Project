Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I absolutely LOVE this place! Great customer service, polite folks, and great food? What more could I ask for! I always get the OMG French Toast and the Benny Goodman, both of which are and delicious. Anytime family or friends come to visit Houston, i make it a point to take them to brunch here. It's super packed during the weekends, so on a day off I'll come here on the weekdays and just wait 15 minutes as opposed to 1.5 hours, but either way the wait is totally worth it. I normally go peruse books at half price books across the street while I wait. I especially like it because all of the staff are very warm, kind, and understanding. They try to be as accommodating as possible. I can't say enough great things about this place. Totally worth it!
