JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Atmosphere is very hip. Dim lighting, small personal or two person tables all along the walls but two large community tables near the center. Maybe not the best arrangement for large parties/families but they can accommodate it with some finessing. Always packed so it tends to be a little loud but honestly the food is worth it all!!!
