JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I fell in love with traditional Japanese ramen since I first tried it in Austin and this place is really great! I have been twice, once to this location (downtown) and once to their other location in Clearlake and both are amazing and the food is consistent. The wait staff is super helpful if you are new to ramen and will give suggestions if you ask. I had the tempura brussels sprouts and the Tonkotsu Black both of which were super flavorful and delicious. The pork was tender and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try ramen. It also makes for a fun date night.
