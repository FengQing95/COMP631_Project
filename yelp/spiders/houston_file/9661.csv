JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The lines are always through the door, spring and fall isn't so bad to wait but winter is a little harsh. My favorite ramen spot because it's not all pork based, you have chicken and vegetarian options from the broth to the protein you use. I myself prefer chicken broth based soups. I've never been disappointed be the appetizers, regular ramen choices or the chef monthly recommendations.
