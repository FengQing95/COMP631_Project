JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had to wait for whole party to arrive before being seated. We were seated in a corner of a long table which made it difficult to talk. Waiting staff was friendly and food was good and worth a try. Requested to change seats to a table for 4, they arranged it, which was nice.
