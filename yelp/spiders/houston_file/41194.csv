Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's OK. The place is overrated and overpriced for what it is. I end up spending as much as I would for dinner (about $30) for just two desserts, a drink, and maybe a croissant of some sort (they have tons of different kinds of bread). The place is usually packed, so if you don't mind waiting in line, then you should try it at least once. The place is oddly designed as there are barely any places to sit. We ended up sitting with other people. There are other bakeries/dessert places in town that are much better.
