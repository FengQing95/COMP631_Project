Baby Barnaby's////Wonderful breakfast experience at this cute place! I had the Migas for breakfast. Chilis, tomatoes, tortilla strips, chorizo, eggs and cheese, served with potatoes and salsa. Delicious! My son had French toast, another had pancakes with apples and pecans, my husband the breakfast plate with biscuits, eggs, grits, and sausage. Everything was hot and fresh. I wish I had our server's name because he was great! Go visit this great place for breakfast! You will not be disappointed.
