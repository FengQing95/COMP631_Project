Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Chocolate croissant - I have a thing for chocolate croissants, so I was very excited for how big and pretty this looked. But when I cut into it, I was disappointed. More than half of the pastry was just air, which is what made it so big. It was a mediocre croissant at best. And again, too greasy. I'm seeing a trend there, and it's not like I don't like butter. For some ready the greasiness here just doesn't taste good. 2/5
