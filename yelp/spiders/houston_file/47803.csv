Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Bloody Mary is decent, MARIAH forgot the bacon but whatever. I didn't try the mimosa, so we continued to stand around and again in that "tone" MARIAH made sure to let us know that we were pretty much in the way. I guess it's only order and pick up drinks which is cool, but again it was the tone that was irking my nerve. Like chill out, this is our first time here, the place is jam packed with people standing waiting for tables. Oh and another thing MARIAH carded me and the person I was with which was no problem, but remember that small piece of information as you keep reading.
