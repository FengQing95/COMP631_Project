Local Foods////I've tried the crispy chicken sandwich and house chips recently. Â I liked the sandwich, but it wasn't what I imagined, if you know what I mean. The house chips were crispy, and I was given more than I would have needed. Overall, I still prefer the truffled egg sandwich combo I got before, but I'd love to continue to explore the menu.
