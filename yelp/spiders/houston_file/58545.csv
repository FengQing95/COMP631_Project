Baby Barnaby's////We looked over the menu, were delighted with the choices, and excited to order. One of my companions asked if they could make a mocha. The server said, simply, "No." No alternatives were even given. She then asked if she could please have a half cup of hot chocolate and a cup for coffee (the coffee comes in thermoses, so you pour yourself). The server said, "We don't really do that here." My friend asked, "So you won't give me half a cup of hot chocolate and half a cup of coffee and let me put them together?" The server replied, "No, we don't really do that here." I was shocked. Asking for two things that the restaurant does serve, and being denied them... it's just baffling. To be downright argued with by the staff, twice in one meal, over things that should be a non-issue- that left me speechless.
