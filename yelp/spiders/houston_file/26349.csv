The Pit Room////My only negative critique is that I believe they probably use too large of a brisket (I tend to find that briskets that start in the 10-12 lb range and render down are the best in terms of relative marbleing and absorbing flavor) and the flavors and smoke simply won't permeate the entire brisket (when cooking at 225 which is what The Pit Room does).   With my brisket, 90% of it was fantastic, a great bark on it, etc..but deep in the middle there wasn't as much flavor.
