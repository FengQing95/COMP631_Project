Kata Robata////We made reservation for a large party on Fathers Day and gave our credit card. Even though the restaurant was not crowded and walk-ins were served , the front desk girl made us wait for 15 minutes as the table was already set. They do not have a system of retaining valued customers. They just wanted to create a false atmosphere of crowds waiting at the front door.
