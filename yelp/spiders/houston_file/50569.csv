Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came in with a friend around 11AM on a Monday and there was already a 20 minute wait! Clearly this place is popular, and for the right reasons! Luckily we ended up only waiting about 10 minutes because we chose to get seated at the bar. The bartender was sweet and attentive.
