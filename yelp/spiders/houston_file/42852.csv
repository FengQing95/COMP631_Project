Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Besides the pastries, they didn't have a lot of alternate, healthy breakfast options besides a fruit yogurt cup, so I was wishing for more [stocked+appealing] menu options... The coffee was pretty solid, and pastries that I did try were tasty, though not exceptional.
