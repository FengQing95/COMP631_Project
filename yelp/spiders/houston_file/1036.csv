JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was in town visiting in town from Los Angeles where I go to Jinya about 3-4 times a week so I know the ins and outs. I come to this location where the portion size was very small, I got the vegan ramen where i was told i couldn't substitute the Tofu for Broccoli which i always do. I was told i would be charged for my broccoli instead of getting it in place of the tofu which was very strange. The sweet potato sticks at this location were very very small so i had to order two. Although my food was good id be hesitant on coming back to this location.
