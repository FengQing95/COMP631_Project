JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Extremely Salty, would definitely ask for less salt next time around. The portion size was pretty decent, although not as big as some of the other ramen places I've been to. Broth was very flavorful (a tad too salty, which could explain why the ramen was extremely salty overall). I would like to say, the egg was fantastic!
