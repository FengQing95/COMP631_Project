Baby Barnaby's////The green eggs are two scrabbled eggs made with artichokes, cheese and maybe one other thing and it's delicious. It comes with a side of chicken sausage, that is equally delicious, potatoes and toast. The potatoes were cut in little cubes and crunchy. Just dip them in ketchup and you're good to go. My BF and I subbed the toast for a biscuit. BEST. DECISION. EVER. And it comes with two biscuits!! The biscuits are so fluffy with a hint of sweet. Amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and will return!
