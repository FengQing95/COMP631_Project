Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love Common Bond down to the lovely decor and modern layout with open windows and bright light to the yummy pastries that are made fresh every morning. I was in the area and decided to grab some dessert because I haven't been here for awhile. They have a private lot for parking, which isn't so bad on account of the location.
