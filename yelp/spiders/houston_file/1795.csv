JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Elle - Thanks for your review. I'm not sure why our chicken chashu would have a taste of raw chicken. The meat is, as you noted, thoroughly cooked, and pieces are inspected by our prep staff. But if you're ever displeased with ANY aspect of your meal, please inform your server and he or she will make things right.
