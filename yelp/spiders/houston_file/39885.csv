Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Even though we had a larger group and you could see the annoyance on a few of the servers faces, service was pretty good. All of our food arrived hot & at a timely manner. I ordered the pineapple sage elixir (tasty but not strong) and sampled various appetizers. I did not care for the Parmesan crusted "meatballs" or the jam that came with it.
