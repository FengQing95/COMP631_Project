Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Knocking off a star - second time that the wait time for ordered food is late. I was the first order of the day and still wait long than others that had food orders as well after me. Great coffee and ordered pastries but cooked order - too late. Ended up at Blacksmith with less wait for food and of course a very good latte
