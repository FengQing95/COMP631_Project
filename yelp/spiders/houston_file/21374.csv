Uchi////This review has been one of the hardest review to write. I came here when it was soft opening (January 23, 2012) with my family. I wanted to give my family the best dining experience ever but it didn't turn out that way. My reservation was at 7 p.m. and the customer service was lagging where we didn't get out until 10:30 p.m. The food did not come out quick enough and the waitress/waiters were getting mixed up with our orders and the table next to us.
