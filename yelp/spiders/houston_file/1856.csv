JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of Jinya Ramen Bar.  I am sorry to hear you were disappointed by the service.  Fridays are usually our busiest day of the week and often times things can get a little hectic when all the customers come in at one time.  Nevertheless, I understand customers expect the same attentive service at all times regardless of how busy the restaurant is.  I will pass your experience along to my staff and improve on this matter right away.
