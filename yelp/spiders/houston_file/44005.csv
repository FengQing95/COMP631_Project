Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only drawbacks to this place is that the parking situation is not great (they have a small lot and when I went I had to wait 10 mins for a spot to open up) and the inside is kind of cramped. The tables are pretty close together and it's very loud. I probably wouldn't come here to stay and chat with a friend. However, I will definitely be coming back for many more iced lattes and cookies to go!
