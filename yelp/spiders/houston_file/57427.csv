Kata Robata////Great place to grab sushi with friends and family. We decided to come here after watching a movie and got a table fairly quickly. The staff was really nice and the place was clean. The food was so good, we'll have to come back to try all the menu items. Highly recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area and want to get sushi.
