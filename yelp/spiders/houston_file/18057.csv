Uchi////Whatever you do, don't get the omakase.   It's the opposite of the experience that you want and that you can get at exceptional places like Kata Robota.  They bring the courses seconds after the last one is cleared, or at times before you're even done.   We had to ask them to slow the pace down.  They go through the motions of describing the dish but barely notice if you have any questions.  Many of the dishes are delicious but not memorable.  And it's significantly more expensive than Kata Robota which is at least twice as good.   It may be that the regular menu is awesome but omakase is not their thing.  But again, if you go, whatever you do, don't get the omakase.
