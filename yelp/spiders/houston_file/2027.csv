JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great place to go for ramen! Hours are really convenient, especially since it opens late on the weekend. I've been here probably more than 6 times already, and 5/6 have been great service. Food comes out promptly. My favorite ramen is the soy miso. The appetizers were really good as well. The fries with the truffle ketchup is amazing. They are skinny fries that are fried in a way where it's crisp to perfection. The pork gyozas/dumplings were also very flavorful and great as well. Would recommend this place as a late night place.
