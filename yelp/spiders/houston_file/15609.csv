JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello CJ M. - Thank you very much for the follow-up. It is supremely useful to us. I have initiated a thorough investigation into the incident to determine who is (was) responsible for such poor service. I apologize again and reiterate that this type of service is not -- and will not -- be tolerated.
