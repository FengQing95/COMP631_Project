Kata Robata////Dined there tonight for the first time, I'd heard great things about this place so my family and I decided to give it a try. The sushi was ok, nothing impressive; though well presented taste was lacking. I also had soft shell crab which was basic and the Shumi lacked flavor though everything LOOKED delicious. Server disappeared and we had to ask anyone passing the table to help us which was frustrating. Manager stood at the sushi areas didn't speak and didn't check on our table. I spend lots of money on eating out and didn't leave feeling good about paying for this food and service. I will not be returning.
