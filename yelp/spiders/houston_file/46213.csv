Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As you go through the line, just point out what you want from the display. They will give it to you on the spot. They have a variety of desserts. A-must is the chocolate chip cookie and the pistachio croissant. The cookies are super chunky with bits of walnuts inside. I love the pistachio fillings inside. Just the right amount of sweetness. The blueberry cheesecake is also a-must with its rich flavors.
