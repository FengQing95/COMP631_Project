Baby Barnaby's////Very shabby and small place with about 50 seats inside and outside. Went there early Sunday morning for breakfast and the wait was less than 10 minutes but it would have probably been longer during peak hours. The food was good, fresh, and plentiful. Service is friendly as well. I ordered Huevos Rancheros which was very good & very fresh and came out very quickly. I couldn't finish my plate and I hardly ever not finish my food. Fresh OJ for $3?? Where else can you find that. I have been a regular at Common Bond which is much fancier but the quality of the food at Barnaby's is way better.
