JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So we came here on a Friday, around 10 am. The sign said it opens at 11 am. So we kill time and walk around. We come back at 11:03 am, and open the door, for them to tell us that they don't open until 1 pm. There were girls sitting at the counter doing their MAKEUP. No sign before hand or anything. Sucks because we drove here from New Orleans, Louisiana (the actual state) to Houston and we're looking forward to eating here. They need to put out in advance when they change opening times or have the sign out at least two-three hours in advance so people aren't just wandering the streets waiting. And don't do your makeup right in front of the store where everyone can see? Makes it seem like serving isn't a priority.
