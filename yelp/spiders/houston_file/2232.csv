JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Myokei - I'm sorry you felt your experience at JINYA was lacking. I try hard to stay on top of my staff about clearing plates in a timely manner, but obviously depending on the demands of the day, this can fall along the wayside and for that I am deeply sorry. I also agree loud music isn't for everyone and I, personally, prefer dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's concept leans towards a trendy, loud atmosphere, which is not going to be all things to all people. But those are the guidelines that I am obligated to follow as a franchisee. But I will relay your message to corporate and hopefully we can make some changes in the future. More importantly, however, is your opinion of our food: I would hope that what you experienced was, in fact, a "bad night" for us, though from the sound of it, you simply didn't enjoy your meal. In hindsight, I would have offered you any other dishes to try in hopes of your finding something you would have liked. Since opening, we have been privileged with a largely positive response from the public, so whenever we receive a one-star review, I want to do everything in my power to reverse that. Primarily because I employ a large number of people whose livelihoods and their families' livelihoods depend on this restaurant's reputation. And if I'm not aiming for perfection, then what's the point?
