Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Well.... I get that people like pastries, but I guess I don't just like paying that much for a pastry and a coffee. It was good... but not something I want to pay for again. Service was a little off...but not enough to make you not want to go if you really love pastries and spending money.
