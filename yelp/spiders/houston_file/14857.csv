JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For dessert we had the green tea and chocolate mochi. This was interesting for me. If you've never had mochi it's made from pounded rice cake and made into a paste. I loved the cute shape. The taste of the outside layer was very reminiscent of this old yellow ice cream cones that come in the sleeve and you can't wait for the ice cream to be gone so you can devour the cone! I loved the smooth creamy chocolate. Was not a fan of the green tea, but I usually hate anything green tea anyway. All in all we really enjoyed this restaurant and will be coming back for more days days.
