Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you want the full selection, get here early because they will sell out. Also if you plan on coming here for weekend brunch, it opens at 9, be there by 8:30. But save a sista a seat & parking; after all, I did give you this tip. Oh yeah, parking is no joke, esp. when you suck a street parking; spots will go quick in the lot.
