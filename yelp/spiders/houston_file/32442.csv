Local Foods////Perfect place for brunch! I luckily came in at the right time because there was no line. The place seems to always be packed. Their sandwiches on their pretzel bun is outta this world. I had the truffled egg salad sandwich with a side of vegan chili and I must say, I have never ate anything that was so filling and was made with fresh ingredients. Perfect place for vegetarians if you happen to be one, but I plan to try out the duck confit on my next visit. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very hip and trendy as well. Good luck finding a parking spot, as you will see it's quite a hot spot.
