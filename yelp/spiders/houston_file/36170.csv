Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First Off, I would recommend a reservation if you want to go in on a Saturday for dinner!! There were 2 host at the host stand, the first one to talk to us was very rude when we informed her we didn't have reservations and rolled her eyes when she turned to the other host asking "Are there any tables available?" Which the other host at least smiled and said we have a table available for 2 hours. (We looked on Yelp before coming in, and ppl on here stated they didn't have reservations but nothing about the Host being rude about it!) It was my boyfriends birthday and I was in charge of finding the restaurant! So the host being rude wasn't a great start to dinner. We ordered the Pulled pork Hush puppies, they were a bit dry but fairly good. My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Chicken and I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich. The Chicken was cooked very well, it had plenty of flavor even to the rice. My dish was good as well. No complaints on our entrees. We wanted to order dessert but we're so full we went ahead and passed on dessert. I would recommend to dress fairly nicely, it's a good date spot or even a good spot for friends to get together. We want to go back for brunch but will probably make reservations and hopefully not run into that same Host!
