Uchi////RIP on the ham and egg roll, why are they fixing the receipe?????  The new Ham and Egg roll is horrible.  I usually order 4 rolls and i always finish every single pieces.  Luckily I ordered one today and I cant freaking finish it.  Whoever invented the new ham and egg roll need to get their taste bug fix.
