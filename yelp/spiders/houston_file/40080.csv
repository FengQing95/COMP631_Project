Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////2nd visit to Bosscat Kitchen for dinner this time. The bourbon whiskey drinks were delicious. For dinner I had the shaved pork & belly sandwich with their homemade slaw. I ordered a side of fries they say take two days to make and they were so delicious. They tasted like a baked potato wedge that was twice fried crunchiness texture with mild seasoning served with a special homemade ketchup. That was so yummy. My husband had this chicken dish over succotash which was equally delicious. We tried the banana pudding for dessert, it was just OK. Overall a nice place to hang out for dinner and we ate outside on the patio and the Â atmosphere was really nice.
