JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ann - Thank you for the updated review. We are very happy to hear that your experience with us has been consistently good. We strive for consistency in everything we do on a daily basis, but it doesn't always work out that way. So it's nice to hear about it when it does. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare, and we appreciate your kind words very much. Please come back soon!
