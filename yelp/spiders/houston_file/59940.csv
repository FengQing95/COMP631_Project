Baby Barnaby's////When I was a child and would read my favorite Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham, I would fantasize about trying those yummy green eggs.  They sounded delicious to me for some odd reason, but alas... they disappeared from memory after realizing no one would ever serve such a thing unless it was just by adding food dye.  Ick.
