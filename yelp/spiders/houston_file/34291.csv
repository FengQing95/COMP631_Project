Local Foods////After seeing my Houston friends post photos of their food and of this place, it was the first thing on my list of things to do when I came back. Having been spoiled by the Austin food scene, I was expecting/hoping it would be like Noble Sandwiches in terms of quality, unique items, service, and ambience. It succeeded overall except one area--unique items. By that, I mean a deli that offers more than just sandwiches and salads. Noble had ox waffles!!!
