JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What a neat ramen place! I've heard hat if you're going to try ramen that this is the place to go. There will be a little wait, no reservations are taken, but I only waited around 39 minutes to be seated. Side note: there is community seating. We were in community seating and it's not as awkward as my crew thought it would be. You can really only hear what your group is talking about.
