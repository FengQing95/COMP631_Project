JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jennifer - Thank you for the excellent review. I'm glad you were able to give us a try, and even more glad that you enjoyed our fare. For the sake of clarity, our Cha Cha Cha Ramen contains fish powder, which we add to the broth. Otherwise, thank you again for the kind words, and we hope to serve you again soon!
