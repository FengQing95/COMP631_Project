JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Back after 2 years in the cold day, still good every time dine-in. Takoyaki was  tasty, just need a bit temperature inside as it is supposed to be. Crispy chicken didnt stay in my mind. jinya tonsotku black is the best all the time.  Server was attentive,  fast,  need a little bit ,  little bit friendliness in the conversation because Jinya is the downtown upscale theme so I expected more than just fast and attentive service (8/10).   Plus one star for free parking.
