The Pit Room////This is a good BBQ joint. I got the brisket and asked for lean. It was tender and had a nice flavor. I knocked one star off because the brisket was not even warm. The sauce was really good. Probably one of my favorite BBQ sauces. My hubby tried a brisket taco and a chicken taco. They were huge. Was made with really good tortillas. He liked the chicken taco the best but did like the brisket one too. We had charro beans which were really good. Potato salad was good. Mac n cheese was ok. My heart and stomach still belong to Killens BBQ joint but this place is good. A heck of a lot closer to me too. I will be back! Go try it!
