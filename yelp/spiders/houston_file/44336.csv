Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've ordered brunch/lunch here a handful of times and I've never been disappointed. Same when it comes to the coffee and pastries. The only thing is everybody else seems to have cottoned on and the place is constantly full. It's rather small to begin with. I used to try and study here. While it is doable, the place seems more designed for frequent turnover, which is just as well because it would get too packed otherwise and nobody would get a chance to try their treats. There was a period when they limited their free wifi hours to keep students from camping out there all day, and while it's understandable, I was a little salty about that for a while. But it seems they've expanded their seating (by cramming it into every little space possible) and are now more liberal with the wifi.
