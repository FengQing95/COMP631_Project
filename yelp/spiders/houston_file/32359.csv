Local Foods////The cabbage slaw was a nice fresh side that offset the main dishes, and the house-made kettle chips were just the right combo of crunchy and soft, with a kick of Old Bay that made my day. By far the best thing at Local Foods are the chocolate macarons...we had two apiece both before and after lunch. If you have a little time and don't mind the wait, this is an excellent spot for a relaxing afternoon.
