Uchi////For appetizers/dinner, we tried the Roasted Edamame (addictive), Brussels Sprouts (perfectly crisp with just the right amount of Lemon Chili sauce) , Kinoko Gyu (Miso-cured Rib-Eye with Maitake and a creamy radish sauce) , Social Zero Sen Roll (creamy and delicious with Yellowfin and Avocado), Taraba (King Crab with a Bernaise sauce and sunchokes....totally memorable...I want more!), Social Crunchy Tuna (another table fave), Bacon Tataki (awesome...who doesn't love bacon?) and Dewbee Chicken (Chicken Breast wrapped in Banana leaf with Thai Chili vinegar and rice).
