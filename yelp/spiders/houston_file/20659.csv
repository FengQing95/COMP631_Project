Uchi////Let me first say that I rarely eat sushi and usually am not a fan. This place changed all that. Everything about this place is amazing. The ambiance is great for a date or just a fancy night out with friends. The waiters...our's was Brian...are awesome. They are extremely knowledgeable and know exactly what to recommend. This was some of the best food I've ever tasted. Don't get hung up on how much everything costs. If you're worried about that, then this might not be the place for you. It's all about the experience and tasting new foods that will make your taste buds go nuts. I can't wait for a good reason to come back again!!
