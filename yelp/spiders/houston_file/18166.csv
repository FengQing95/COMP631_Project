Uchi////Those were the dishes we had. As for the service, since we were first-timers, every dish that made its way to our table came with a detailed explanation of the concept behind the dish, a little background on the ingredients, and an absolutely pleasant service attitude! Seriously, the service here rocked my socks off. I was actually a little sad saying goodbye to our waiter!!
