Uchi////Uchi is a vegetarian's holy grail!! Not a huge brussel sprouts girl but theirs are out of the world. I will be ordering these every time I go. Veggie Yokai was a great unique refreshing take for my palette. Nasu Nigiri, Chef's Vegetarian Roll, and Pitchfork in that order with the eggplant being my favorite. Celebrated my friend's birthday and every time a waiter(ess) came by they wished her- so sweet and inviting! The Jasmine Cream dessert was a yummy and magical way to end the night. Perfect place to come to celebrate special occasions with family and friends.
