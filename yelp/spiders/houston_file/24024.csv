Uchi////We took an uber instead of driving, since I didn't want to deal with parking (the real truth is I don't like driving).  There was already a line out the door and we were anxious!  Turns out they don't open their doors until 5PM and everyone in the line had reservations.  We were greeted immediately and upon offering my reservation name, were seated at a booth.
