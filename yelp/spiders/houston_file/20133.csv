Uchi////Bottom line, would I return to Uchi next time I'm in Houston? Probably not. When I drop over a hundred on a meal I want to 1. Not walk out hungry 2. Be more than slightly impressed by the food and 3. Have an overall enjoyable experience. Uchi pretty much didn't come through on even one of the three.
