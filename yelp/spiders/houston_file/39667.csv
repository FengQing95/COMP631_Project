Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We split an order of steak and a side order of Mac and cheese. Their proportions are pretty big so both me and my friend were full! Although it is a little expensive, (it is a bar and it's in the fancy area of houston) it's made up by the fact that the food is really good!
