Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is one of the many hip new cafes that have cropped up on Montrose in the past couple of years, but it is LITERALLY my favorite. Of course, like most cafes in the area, Common Bond is a little on the pricier end, has a obscenely compact parking lot, and you can expect it to be swamped with brunch-loving yuppies on the weekends.
