Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Got the OMG French toast and the Ham Benedict III. Both were spectacular. The French toast sauce (some mix of salted caramel, vanilla cream and mascarpone cheese) was phenomenal. It tasted like warmed condense milk and I refused to let our waitress remove my plate before I licked every last drop. The Brioche was buttery and fluffy and was a good match for the delicious sauce. I only wished they would have dipped the bread in the sauce for longer so the middle can soak up more of the sauce as it was a bit bland.
