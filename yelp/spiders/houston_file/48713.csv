Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I think this place is overhyped. They offer pancakes with fun/interesting flavors that I was excited to try, but I didn't think they actually tasted good at all. Too sweet and very rich. You need a nap after eating anything here! On my next trip, I tried one of the savory dishes, but did not feel that it was better than any other typical brunch place. Not to mention, there is almost always a line for a table and parking is limited...overall, not worth it!
