Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ordered French Toast. The bacon was great; the fruit was tasty; the whipped butter perfect. The bread was heavy, dry, impossible to cut, need some liquid to be able to swallow. Compare with Sicilian Toast at Empire Cafe . That was a delight, this was a BAD breakfast! To add insult to injury, this item was way overpriced!
