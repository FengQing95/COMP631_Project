The Pit Room////I got their beef rib and then added on a two meat dinner of pork ribs and brisket. Their pork ribs are delicious too but the beef blows it away. Their brisket is more on the lean side but surrounded by their rub.  Sauce is served on the side as it should be when you have a good product. But their sauce itself is delicious if you want to compliment the meat.  They have a very flavorful coffee alt BBQ sauce too.
