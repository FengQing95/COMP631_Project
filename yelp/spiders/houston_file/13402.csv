JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First and foremost, all of our staff at JINYA have been trained to treat everyone who walks through our doors with the respect, courtesy and dignity that we would hope to receive in return. Secondly, as a business, we can never presume an individual's status based on their appearance; if a customer takes a seat at the bar and orders food or drink, we treat them with the assumption that they are paying customers.
