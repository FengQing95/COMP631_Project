JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has good service and is pretty inside. It's very small though so there's always a wait. Even on Wednesday night there was a 20 min wait. I got the chicken ramen and enjoyed it. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I expected, but it was ok. I also got the fried chicken nuggets but didn't like them as much as the Tap house chicken nuggets.
