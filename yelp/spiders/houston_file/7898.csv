JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would say that just about every ramen shop in town gets the "too salty" critique. But in all honesty, this is a subjective measure, and we're never going to please every single customer every single time. But we promise to do our best, and, again, if you're not 100% satisfied with your bowl, just let your server know. We will do everything in our power to meet your satisfaction.
