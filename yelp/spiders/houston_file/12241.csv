JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For my main dish, I got the spicy miso Tonkotsu. This didn't come with an egg like other ramen places. So I ordered a seasoned egg (an additional $1, but worth it in my opinion! -it isn't ramen without an egg) and requested it to be sliced in half. The ramen was good. It came out hot and the broth was good. It was not too dense and heavy. I think this bowl comes normally with thick noodles (but there is an option of thin noodles). I think I would've preferred the thin noodles. The egg was cooked with the yolk a tad runny, my FAV!!! I definitely think the egg made the presentation of the dish more appealing.
