Uchi////Fantastic! Innovative Japanese food at its best. We had a great experience at Uchi, and I would highly recommend going with a small group. The dishes are small plates so they're meant to be shared while giving you the opportunity to order multiple dishes from across the regular and daily menus. Our server was highly knowledgeable about the dishes as well as the drinks. Great service starts with a staff who knows the restaurant and what they're serving.
