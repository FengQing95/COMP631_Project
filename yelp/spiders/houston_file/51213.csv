Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////1. Haven for Indecisive Diners: Â I was born with this... disability. It's quite sad actually. I am completely unable to choose food items for myself due to the fear of disappointment. My indecisiveness has resulted in countless arguments and severe h-anger pains. The cure? Snooze's Pancake Flight, and the Benny Duo. Choose 3 out of 8 pancakes and 2 out of 6 benedicts. Now the only thing you'll have to decide is how you'll get home after stuffing your face with insane amounts of breakfast.
