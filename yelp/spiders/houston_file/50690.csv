Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got the spuds deluxe with sausage and mushrooms, the benny duo with the ham benedict and the chile verde, and the blueberry danish pancakes. The spuds deluxe came as a HUGE plate of hash browns, which were good but not spectacular. Both the benedicts however were delicious! The smoked cheddar hollandaise, poached egg, and english muffin were such a great combination on the ham benedict. The pancakes are also huge, but seemed a bit dry. Favorite part of the blueberry danish was the cream cheese filling in the center. Overall would go again for the eggs benedicts.
