Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wanted to try some of the different pancakes so I got the Pancake Flight - blueberry, chocolate chip and peanut butter cup, side of bacon and hash-browns. I wouldn't recommend getting two chocolate pancakes on the Flight, it was a little too much. The blueberry had a unique flavor, the batter had a hint of cornmeal. The bacon was out of this world!
