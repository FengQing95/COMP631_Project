Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The classical satirist Juvenal once wrote that all the Roman people needed was bread and circuses. Now, this was a bit condescending to the Romans, implying that a loaf and a gladiator fight were enough to buy the people, but as for me, if that loaf of bread came from Common Bond, then it might just be enough to accompany our own local circus (also known as the Houston Texans).
