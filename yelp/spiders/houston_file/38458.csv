Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Terry is THE MAN! Best service in Houston without a doubt! Definitely coming back and looking for him. Very cool, very knowledgeable. Asked what we liked and had us a specialty drink made that was ON POINT. Very chill atmosphere great music selection and they had the NFL games playing so it covered all the bases for me. Bosscat Burger Chefs way? Highly recommended 5stars. I don't eat onions normally but these guys know what they're doing with the flavors. I'm a picky eater but I trusted Terry's recommendation and was not disappointed. Oh and Great Old Fashions too!
