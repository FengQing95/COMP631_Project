JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Katy - Thanks for your great review. I'm glad you have enjoyed our ramen during your multiple visits. I agree the wait times and bathroom lines during peak hours can be tedious, but we'll soon be opening more JINYA outposts in Houston, which should alleviate some of these crowds. I appreciate your pointing out the potential culture gap in regards to communal seating, the "irrashai" greetings, and osme aspects of our dishes. There are numerous aspects to our restaurant that are steeped in Japanese culture since JINYA was founded by a gentleman named Tomo Takahashi who is Japanese by birth. Thank you again for visiting us and we look forward to serving you again soon!
