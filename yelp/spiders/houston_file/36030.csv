Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////great atmosphere and friendly service. we had a party in their private room in september. this room is really great because it is mostly windows so you can see the restaurant and not feel isolated with 4 walls and a door. last saturday we had lunch which consisted mostly of burgers, tater tots, fries, salads and avocado toast. ALL were so delicious! the owner, john reed, stopped by our table for a visit. apparently he is always there which is no doubt why it is consistently good. we will definitely return to bosscat!
