The Pit Room////Food was absolutely delicious!! The beef rib literally melted in my mouth and don't even get me started on the elote!! Best corn I've ever had and the Mac and cheese is also a favorite side of mine. The only problem I had is that it is very busy and things sell out so get there a bit earlier!
