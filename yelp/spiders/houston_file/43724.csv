Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////One of my favorite spots to go to when I am in Houston. Desserts here are utterly delicious. The coffee is amazing too ( especially the vanilla lattes) expect long lines Saturday and Sunday mornings. But if you are looking for upscale desserts and yummy food for breakfast and lunch I would highly recommend coming here! The only downside is the crowds... If you want to avoid them its good to come here after 3pm :)
