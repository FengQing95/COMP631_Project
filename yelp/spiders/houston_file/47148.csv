Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The memorable service lured me back for a second visit. The service wasn't as impressive as Katrina's, but it was fine. I had the Breakfast Pot Pie with a sunny side up egg this time and didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The flavors were bland, but the crust was perfectly flaky. It was definitely filling, and I had to bring home the leftovers. I also ordered the pancake of the day for dessert, which I believe was a blueberry Danish pancake. It was delicious!
