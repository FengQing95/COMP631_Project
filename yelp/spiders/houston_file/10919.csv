JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm giving this place four stars for the atmosphere and service. However the ramen itself was kind of a disappointment after reading all the praise on yelp. I'm from the Washington DC area and I'm not ramen connoisseur but I've had better ramen from a whole foods super market as well as another super market in San Diego.
