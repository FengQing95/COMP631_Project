JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Luckily we have several options available nowadays and I haven't visited all the new places. (Let it be known; Tatsuya was kind of a letdown.) Jinya's tonkotsu black always hits the spot for me so my family is a frequent guest here. Service is always topnotch here but my recent experience shows just how devoted Jinya team is for customer satisfaction.
