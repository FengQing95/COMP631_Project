JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food is absolutely amazing. I loved the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff; particularly Johnny. Johnny D had my b and brought his g to the t. He answered all my questions (it was my first time) explained menu options and served us with a smile. Â Bravizzimo
