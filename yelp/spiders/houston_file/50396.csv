Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came opening weekend about six months ago, they didn't fail me then, and they didn't fail me today. I recommend you sit nowhere but the bar. I was so happy to see Theresa running it. She made my experience so much more memorable the first time, and still managed to go over and beyond on this occasion.
