Baby Barnaby's////I've had a variety of menu items here and among the top of my list are their migas and their breakfast plate w/ biscuits and a side of gravy.  Side note my fellow veg-heads-they have veggie sausage alternatives for us!  Back in my meat eating days I would kill some Bob's Healthy Plate as well.
