Local Foods////They have Good food  But POOR POOR  Customer service  What every you do  do not speak with them on the phone..  Cody at the Kirby location should not be answering the Phone.  The Manager Kegan  while telling you he is helping  really is doing nothing  While saying that they have a line out the door  and have no time to take care of a $250:00 order.   Houston is a large city  and there is plenty of places  that deserve a line out the door   THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE PLACES   Get better people to represent the food that you offer. THIS IS FOR THE LOCATION ON KIRBY
