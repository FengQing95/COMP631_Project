Uchi////I'm sure everyone knows this, but don't expect to be full unless you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars, cause we certainly weren't as we left. If you're looking for a good sushi experience without caring much for cost, then Uchi is a fine option. However, in my opinion, when looking at what you're getting from what you pay, Uchi is just average compared to its competition in Houston.
