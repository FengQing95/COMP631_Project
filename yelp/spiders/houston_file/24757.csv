Uchi////Uchi has always been my top 3 sushi places, only because there arent many in Houston but also because they have innovative dishes along with fresh fish flown in. Anything you get here would be pretty good. I love the knowledge my servers have on all the dishes and how quick the dishes come out for fine dining. I have yet to try omakase but would love to soon. Happy hour here is pretty amazing also for those who want to try a variety of dishes without breaking bank.
