Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The ambience here is quite neat. It's classy, hipster, modern, and chic all at the same time (+ cheers for a ton of outdoor lighting!).  Not recommended if you're cramming for final exams, but a perfect spot to take a date or someone new to the Houston area.  Weekend afternoons here are pretty packed, but outdoor seating and a fast customer turnover more than make up for it.
