JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loved the Ramen here! The atmosphere is nice. It's pretty trendy and a nice place to meet up with friends. Came for the 1st time because of the high recommendations from family and friends and this place did not disappoint. The bowl sizes were good, but I really loved the flavor in the broth of the Ramen. Brought a couple of ramen newbies with us and they are now hooked. Had to warn them not every place would be as good. Will definitely be back. Hopefully this will place will be the place that makes my husband like ramen.
