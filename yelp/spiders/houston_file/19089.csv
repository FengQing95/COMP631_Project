Uchi////Uchi is by far the best restaurant in Houston! This is absolutely not an exaggeration. All the ingredients are fresh. The waiters are professionally trained to introduce every dish. The food is impeccable and very different. The presentation of their food is even more interesting! It's a little bit pricy but I would pay for fantastic food anytime especially when every detail is being thought out to this extent. I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a light Japanese fusion restaurant. Definitely try my favorite duck jar!
