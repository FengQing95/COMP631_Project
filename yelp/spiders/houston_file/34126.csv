Local Foods////     They made a fatty like me fall in love with quinoa!  I had the Bahn Mi with a quinoa salad that had red beans and tomatoes and corn was deliciousness all mixed in together. The Bahn Mi was delicious. The pork was so tender and juicy it almost tasted like prime roast beef. The sliced fresh jalapeños were a massive hit with me. Loved that level of heat.
