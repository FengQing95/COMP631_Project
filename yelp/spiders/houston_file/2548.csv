JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for the food, the ramen here is amazing. Best I've had in town. I always go for the pork-based ramens because it's more flavorful than the chicken (in my opinion). Love the tapas-style appetizers as well. The dumplings are a must try along with the tempura brussels sprouts. All in all, a great place for ramen.
