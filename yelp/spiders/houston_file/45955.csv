Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place was amazing!! It was our first time trying a local coffee shop in Houston as we are from out of state and this place is the real deal! The manager, Jaimon, was on the floor and helping out which is always good to see. It also felt like the three areas (drinks, pastries, and the kitchen) worked together really well to provide a great experience. The food and drinks were great, too. The sausage and egg sandwiches were a sizable portion and my friend's soft scramble was delicious. As for the drink, it was one of the best iced lattes I've ever had! I wish I had a location in my hometown!
