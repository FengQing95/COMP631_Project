Local Foods////Yum yum yum. This is my food dream. The menu is what I imagine I could make at home with my local produce box if I had the skill set and was not lazy. I love their sandwiches so much, I haven't even tried their salads. My favorite is the falafel sandwich. Most falafel sandwiches suffer from "too much bread syndrome," where the chickpeas and the bread start to gum up your mouth into something really unpleasant. NOT THIS ONE. Local Foods adds just the right amount of yogurt to cut the gumminess and makes the sandwich melt in your mouth. Oh, did I mention the falafel was crispy??
