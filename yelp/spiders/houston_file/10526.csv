JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is probably my favorite ramen place in town. I love the ramen (especially the Cha Cha Cha). The broth is rich, thick, and creamy. The noodles are served just right as well. The only thing I don't really like when I eat here is that it gets really noisy. They welcome guests in a certain way by saying some Nihongo phrases out loud, and I ALWAYS get startled whenever they do that (especially when I'm at the communal table). But hands down, this is a good place for ramen. I go to Jinya almost every month. It's a must.
