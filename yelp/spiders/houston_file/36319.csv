Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Stumbled upon Bosscat while visiting Houston. Walked in and was instantly gratified. Upon walking in the crowd was incredibly inviting and the atmosphere was great! First I ordered at negroni that was made perfectly. I then was asked if I wanted to take a tour of the whiskey room which was beautiful. Each bottle of whiskey was individually displayed. Talked with the bartender Matt and he was very personable. Will come back to Bosscat every time I visit Houston without a doubt.
