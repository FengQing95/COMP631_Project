Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was very underwhelming and expensive - my least favorite combination. I only came in to use the 10% off, not worth it. The flat bread was a little over $10, and the bread itself had a weird texture and was very thick. The corn madelines were the best part. Valet is free, but have cash to tip.
