JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I LOVE Jinya. I am here about once per week for a bowl of ramen. The Karagge chicken ramen and wonton chicken ramen are my favorites. Order it without the spice and then you can add as much or as little as you want from the spicy sauce available at the table. It gets pretty packed and hard to get a table unless you show up pretty early for dinner. I usually call in the order and it's ready 20 minutes later.
