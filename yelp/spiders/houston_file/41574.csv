Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Only stayed BC my companion had so looked forward to it. Service was o.k. Chocolate chip cookies and desert ingredients were top quality. Melon/cucumber gazpacho was just descent. Went there hoping for a full meal, but not enough vegetarian entree options. They were also out of about half their pastries. I would be happy to support this new bizz and come back to see if they can do better than my these stars, but I would only do that if they were the kind of chefs who thought they could make excellent dishes without using VEAL. It's not that it's meat, it's the type. Please consider ethical practices, and I'll be happy to try you again.
