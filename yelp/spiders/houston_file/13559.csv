JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My sister always order this and it tastes really good. The broth is very flavorful and I love the tofu because it soaks up the broth. Even though it's vegan, it's very heavy in terms of flavor and has a lot of nice textures. The garlic-y flavors really shine through and reminds me of an onion-garlic-creamy soup.
