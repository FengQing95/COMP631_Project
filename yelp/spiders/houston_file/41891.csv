Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had the pulled pork sandwich, chocolate croissant and green tea matcha macaron. In my opinion, the sandwich was tasty, but over priced. The croissant and macaron were absolutely delicious. Definitely one of the top macarons that I have tasted. However, I would not recommend the dessert cup with the whipped cream and chocolate mousse. I had a taste of my friend's and it was overwhelmingly sweet and unpleasant-tasting despite the beautiful decor on the top.
