JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been here a few times since they've opened up. While the ramen is good, it is pricey. They offer many sides for your ramen and I love getting extra crushed garlic. The whole staff greets you when you enter and leave the place. The waiting staff is also very friendly and talks to you and helps you out if you don't what to order. They have a big long table in the middle of the place and you can get seated there. But you will be next to other strangers, but they do have booths and tables that you may sit at also.
