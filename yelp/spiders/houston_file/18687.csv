Uchi////Go ahead and let the waiter/waitress order for you- the menu is confusing and they know way better than you about what is good and how much is enough. I really mean that. Our waitress came up and was like "ok so we are going to start with x, then y, then some z... oh and Â maybe a little of w"- my dads face was priceless... seriously in hysterics scanning the menu trying to find what homegirl was ordering for us... checking prices Im sure.
