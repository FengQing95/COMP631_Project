Local Foods////The Crunchy Chicken Sandwich wasn't what I expected it to be. It's made with shredded chicken breast and tastes fresh and healthy, but it isn't very CRUNCHY at all. The lack of crunch actually made us wonder if they brought out the wrong order. The orzo was good, but the chips were a little too greasy for my liking.
