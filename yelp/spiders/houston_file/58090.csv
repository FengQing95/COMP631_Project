Kata Robata////Had reservations on Valentine's Day and it was great! The food was fresh and very flavorful. Our server was amazing! The beef skewers were so tender and full of flavor. The sushi was very fresh. The green tea souffl√© cheesecake was the best! I want to go back just to order that! Overall 10/10 experience and I will definitely be coming back!
