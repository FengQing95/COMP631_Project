Baby Barnaby's////Lo and behold..Turns out it was the hostess who would be our server and since she was wearing a shirt with three quarter sleeves, each time she came out to take or order our check on us (rarely), she would run her hands up and down her arms in a dramatic signal to us that she did not appreciate being dragged out into the frozen tundra (it was 56 degrees by the way). She wasn't the least bit friendly, would not return to refill our coffee and one of the entrees we ordered came out 15 minutes after the other ones and a little undercooked. But her show of irritation did not end with sub par service...
