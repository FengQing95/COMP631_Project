Uchi////There was the Kamo Oshitoshi (duck confit with swiss chard), sake toro nigiri (salmon belly), bacon tataki (pork belly), foie gras nigiri, makimono (snow crab), mustang roll (yellowtail and eel), brussels sprouts with sweet chili, and fried milk. Â Hands down, our favorite were the ridiculously awesome brussel sprouts followed closely by the melt-in-your-mouth seared foie gras and followed closely by everything else!!!
