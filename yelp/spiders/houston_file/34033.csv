Local Foods////First visit and not a bad place. Parking on a Sunday afternoon was full and it was somewhat packed inside. I ordered their shrimp salad, which had pecans, dried cranberries, light dressing, shaved cheese, and sprinkles of brown rice. Tasted pretty good. Cleared the whole bowl. The portion was a good size.
