Kata Robata////Now for the quirks. I'm not one for perfuming a restaurant up since smells can overwhelm the tastes of the fish, but there was a decidedly less-than-fresh odor I noticed when we walked in. Maybe some nighttime cleaning of the seating surfaces with nice-smelling detergents and/or some deodorizing of the sushi prep area would help. Also, my friend noted that they seemed a little TOO overeager to clear our plates, add more water, etc. At some points, we just wanted people buzzing around less frequently so we could have a less interrupted conversation. She actually had a plate cleared while the bite of food was still on her chopsticks. A little bit more ambience might help. A few tweaks, and this place could become one of my favorites, if it overcomes the few speed bumps.
