JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Orze - Thank you for your review and feedback. It has never been our intention to "hype" our restaurant; on the contrary, more than four years ago we sought to introduce something new and enjoyable to Houston since at that time there were not so many dedicated ramen shops in our city.
