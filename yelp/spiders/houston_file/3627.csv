JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Lettuce begin. With over 1000 review on Yelp, I had to go here! With so many reviews, I was afraid of a long wait, but there wasn't any line at all! Made me and my belly happy. So when I was seated, the server was very nice and gave recommendations. I ordered the Jinya #1: Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($12.95) with an extra of Pork Sobiro ($1.50) and takoyaki. First, the takoyaki came out and came with 6 pieces. Taking a bite, the takoyaki gave a crunch and it was different and good! After we finished, the ramen came out fast and the presentation was set up pretty. As first impression, I thought I could finish the ramen in seconds and not be full, but I was wrong. The taste was amazing. I'm a spicy fan, and Jinya #1 isn't spicy at all. If you want some spice, they do have hot sauce on the table. To be honest, I ordered Pork Sobiro as extra meat, but it was not worth it at all. The ramen already comes with everything and the Pork was like in tiny pieces. Save that dollar! Over all, the place is just as everyone says it is. And I totally recommend it if you want to go out on a date or just hAng with friends!
