JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Karen - Thank you for the stars! I'm glad you were able to find items to meet your dietary needs. I would also recommend our newer Spicy Vegan Ramen, which is slowly becoming a crowd favorite here in Houston -- it has long been a staple at the JINYA franchises in California. But you are correct, Friday at 4PM could easily be considered the calm before the storm, as crowds tend to pick up as early as 5PM and last all the way through Sunday night. That said, we hope to see you again soon!
