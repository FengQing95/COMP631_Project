Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had been in the uphill search for the perfect egg Benedict for a vegetarian... Until I found this place. They allow so many customizations and the veggie alternatives (soyrizo) are SO good that you really can't go wrong with any of the Benedix on the menu. I don't wanna dedicate my whole review to the Benedicts but I use this as a measuring stick for all others (bc I can't keep eating crab Benedict). The sandwich I am, OMG French toast and pancakes are so flavorful and delicious every single time, and I've probably ordered 50+ times already. The dining experience is pretty great too, they've implemented Glass partitions which makes me feel secure but I'm not sure that that is evidence-backed. The service is always friendly. The weekends are pretty busy and if you don't join the waitlist you will end up waiting for 40+ minutes so I suggest calling in advance or ordering in.
