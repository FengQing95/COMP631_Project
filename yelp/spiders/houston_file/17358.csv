Uchi////I tried Uchi last night with my husband and daughter to celebrate my birthday. We found the food to be interesting but nothing more than that. It certainly is not authentic Japanese food. (My husband is Japanese so we know what real Japanese food is).  We ordered the 6-course tasting menu and the 7-piece sushi plate priced at $19. The sushi was teeny tiny. I've lived in Japan for 6 years and have never seen sushi so small. The rice was not seasoned enough with sushi vinegar and it wasn't pressed tightly enough so it crumbled when you try to eat it. Perhaps the sushi is good for sushi novices since its so small and easy to eat in one bite, however for the price...??  Also, the soy sauce they use has NO flavor!  I don't know what brand they use!  I certainly liked Kata Robata sushi better!  The tasting menu was OK. Everything had an interesting presentation and flavor but there was nothing that stood out in my memory. The order that they served the dishes was not correct. The raw, colder dishes should have been served first and then the hot rice dish last. But they served a raw dish after the hot rice dish. That was just wrong!!  And it was expensive at $91 or so.
