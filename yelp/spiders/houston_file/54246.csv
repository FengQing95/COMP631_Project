Kata Robata////Kata Robata is a good example of a restaurant with an extensive menu with strong execution! Oftentimes, restaurants with large menus can be hit or miss, where some menu items are done well and others are mediocre or just plain awful. KR does a great job with everything from cocktails, sushi, seafood salads, to robata, and dessert! Between my three friends and I, we were able to sample dishes under almost every category except for their noodles.
