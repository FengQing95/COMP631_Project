JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our young waitress was pleasant and attentive! Let's get to the important part, the food. This is where points were lost. We ordered spicy ramen, curry, and crispy chicken. Spicy chicken Ramen was pretty good according to hubs. The curry was not what I expected. I'm so glad I got the small plate. It was extremely watery and hardly any chicken there. More sauce than anything. Not being satisfied, I tried something else from the menu. We proceeded to order the chicken, 5 pieces for starters. The chicken was so tough and dry. Tough to the point were I struggled to break off a piece. The taste? Salty as well. I was so disappointed. We might come back and try different items.
