Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here on a Sunday for brunch with a group of girls. The ambiance was FIREEEEE. The playlist was BUMPIN' and our server Terry the greatest waiter everrr. He was very attentive to our needs and wants. We will definitely come back to see our one and only Chocolat√© man (he told us to call him that!!)
