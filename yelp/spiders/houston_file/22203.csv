Uchi////They were able to sit us at the bar, and we knew right away we wanted to try the omakase, which consists of 10 courses (desert is the last one). Well, at the end of 2h sitting at the bar they had served us only 7courses... Looking around the bar you could tell other people were also getting impatient with the long delay in getting the food out. The chefs in front of us is apologizing for the delay and asking us if we would like to cancel the order as they were running behind... There were 6 chefs or whatever they are called, in front of us and all of them were working frenetically. Non stop. However, that doesn't change the fact that I expected much more from Uchi, especially considering the price charged.
