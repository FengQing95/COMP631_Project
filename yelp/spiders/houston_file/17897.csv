Uchi////While this place is pricey, the food is unbelievable. It is such a unique dining experience that combines flavors you could not imagine. The chef is innovative with style and pairings. I have yet to have anything here that I disliked. It is such a cool place to try new things. I highly recommend eating here at least once.
