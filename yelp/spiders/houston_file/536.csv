JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First things first, the ramen is excellent. Broth is flavorful, noodles have a satisfyingly firm texture and the chicken was beautifully prepared. The room is dark and clubby - very nicely decorated. We did see some families dinning so feel free to bring the little ones.
