Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we were seated we were already starving with a lot of breakfast places I only have one maybe two things I can get that aren't pancakes (vegetarian) i had some trouble picking what I wanted but got the vegetarian eggs benedict. They made their own veggie patties to substitute for Canadian bacon. So good! I guess for our wait time we were surprised by not one, but two different kinds of pancakes. Those were AMAZING. I'll definitely be getting those next time
