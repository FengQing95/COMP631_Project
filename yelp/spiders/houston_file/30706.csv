The Pit Room////Service was quick and everyone was nice. We ordered for 5 adults and 1 baby boy. We ordered 1lb of brisket, 1 beef rib, 1/2 a chicken, 1 beef sausage, 1 pork sausage, a pint of the elote, Cole slaw, and charred okra. This was plenty of food for all of us, we even had a meal and 1/2 left over. Now on to the taste review. My favorite was the beef rib, so tender and it fell right off the bone, I was able to slice it with a plastic knife that's how soft it was! The chicken was fresh very juicy and had great flavor. Brisket was on the leaner side usually I love brisket but it did not steal the show this time. Sausages were ok, casings had a nice snap to them. Now for the sides, I'd skip the Cole slaw unless you like the vinegar based kind, I'm more of a KFC Cole slaw so I prefer sweeter ones. The elote looked great but missed on the flavor didn't have that street corn flavor I was hoping for. Â The okra on the other hand was fire I def recommend this side!
