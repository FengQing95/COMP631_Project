Uchi////An hour in, I asked husband to go check.  The hostess said "We're busy, we have lots of people.  It's going to take awhile."  Husband gave the name and the hostess said "Oh... you waited for an hour, we can seat you now."  The table they gave us, we overheard the hostess said (before we asked), to set it for 4.  My husband knew I would be upset so waited until seated before telling me.
