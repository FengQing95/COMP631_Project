JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Heard great things, read great reviews, and was beyond excited to try place as I do love ramen. We walked in and were seated at a two person booth, I asked if we could sit a table on the other side of the restaurant because we had some work to do and the waitress said no. I asked why not and she said that is only for four people meanwhile this was at two o'clock and we were maybe the third other table at the restaurant. There was also a three top sitting at the exact same table. Fine. I ordered an appetizer, and the salad/Gyoza combo for the spicy miso ramen. Just like every meal I've ever ordered I expected the appetizer to come out first. Instead, we got everything at once. The salad was old lettuce with enough dressing to cover one leaf. The dumplings seemed like they had potential to be really great if they weren't ice cold. I had hope for the ramen but one sip and also cold. On the bright side I asked for it to be heated up and once proper temperature and actually steaming at the table this time it was great! I told the server about the salad and dumplings but she left them on the table, and kept them on the bill. I asked when I got the bill and she said sorry that's what you ordered. At this point I just wanted to leave instead of asking for a manager. I know this is shift change time during a restaurant but what a terrible experience. Like I said I was very excited to try this place and I'm beyond disappointed.
