Kata Robata////OK before I start the review... does any one find the girls up front (hostesses) a little snobby/basic? Whenever we call and ask for a wait time or reservations, they have like the most dramatic answers each time that make it seem like you'll be waiting for a table during dinner for like 20 years.. Like good lord, you're doing the most... please calm down. I get the place is busy but having so many rules to make a reservation over the phone is like hilarious... i might as well walk in and wait. For example... Hostess: "Oh Ms. Dey... for a reservation at 8 you should have called at 630..". Me: "Ok *becky* Â you should have stfu'ed but to each their own, maam!") It's actually kind of entertaining at this point so I'm not mad by any means. Regardless I love this place, yes I do; i love this place, how bout you? Pretty sure ever since a coworker has introduced me here I've come at least once a month. I assume their food has crack in everything and I'm an addict with no shame. I'm slowly tackling the entire menu and everything I've tried is delicious and I mean everything. My top favorite roll is the crunchy eel (not on the menu for some reason but they make it), favorite side dish is the lobster mac and cheese, favorite Non roll is the freaking beef skewers... they are so tender that they melt in your mouth... went to happy hour once because I usually miss it because of work and omg it was great and the prices were too! It was awesome. Love this place... huge fan and advocate. Esp of all the beckys', lol! Just kidding girls
