Uchi////Fried milk dessert surely impressed as many have told me to try it! My boyfriend thorough enjoyed the WALU WALU and Japanese sea bream nigiri. I loved the kinoko nabe (mushroom crispy rice bowl) and WALU WALU as well! But EVERYTHING TRULY JUST SHINED!!!! Also loved how detailed they were in instructing how to properly enjoy the sushi and allowing you to grab it with your fingers and place fish side down o the tongue and explaining a lot of the thought process of the chefs in building the plates. So dedicated.
