JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My girlfriend had the vegetable ramen which left much to be desired. This is why I am subtracting a star. I suppose every restaurant has their specialties and let me tell you, the veggie ramen is not their highlight. She ate about half before she got bored. 3/5 at best for the veggie.
