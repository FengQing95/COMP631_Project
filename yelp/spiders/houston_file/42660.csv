Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is great! The brunch is delicious, the pastries are yummy (sad they aren't warm) and the coffee is strong! The only pitfall of this place is that they have a long long wait which means they run out quickly on the weekends. They also don't have a large parking I lot. Glad they're doing well!
