Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For the main meal, I ordered the steak. I love me a good, juicy steak. The steak was large and cooked medium rare - how any steak should be eaten in my opinion. The fatty pieces of the steak were succulent and I did enjoy every bite, but I only ate so much just because I had a plethora of appetizers. A mistake on my end, but that's okay. I still enjoyed it regardless and had plenty of left overs to take home for my boyfriend to try. Though I did enjoy the steak, I believe I'll be trying another entree next time around.
