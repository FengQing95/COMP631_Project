The Pit Room////Amazing real Texas barbecue in the best part of town. If you find yourself in Montrose, and have a craving for some amazing smoked meats, get your a$$ to the Pit Room. You're not living your life right if you don't try the brisket, but that being said, get the beef rib.  The tacos are on point and they do the all the usual Q fixins right.  My last trip to the Pit put a hurting on me. So much amazing food that you just can't stop.  Pro tip: the leftovers make for a banging breakfast taco.
