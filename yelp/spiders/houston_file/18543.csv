Uchi////Great modern sushi with a very hip vibe. Uchi (Houston) is an extension from Uchi and Uchiko in Austin and I would put it on par with the Austin locations. I enjoyed the Hama Chili and sake sushi very much. The hama chili is probably my favorite dish from this restaurant as I'm a big fan of citrus flavored foods and Uchi does a great job adding the orange slice to this piece of yellowtail. It has a hint of thai chili that adds a little kick and is delicious! I'd also recommend the uchi salad! It interestingly served in classes where you use your hands to dip the leafs into the dressing. This is a great date spot if you're willing to shell out the cash. If it weren't so expensive I'd be back every week!
