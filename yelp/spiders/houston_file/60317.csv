Baby Barnaby's////It's cramped and there's typically a long wait but it's my fave Barnaby's location. The food is good and staff have been consistently friendly. My fave is the green eggs. Eggs w/ spinach, artichoke, and some other green goodness plus cheese. I'm picky about eggs and how they are cooked and what's in them but these are Yumm!
