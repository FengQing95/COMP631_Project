Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went for a late breakfast on Friday and the line was to the door (apparently it's like this every Friday, Saturday and Sunday). It moves quickly but finding a place to sit is a real challenge -- the place was filled to the brim. Parking is also a challenge because the shared lot is pretty small - I parked a couple streets away and walked.
