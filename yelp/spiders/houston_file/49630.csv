Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went on a busy Friday morning. The wait was about 45 minutes long but I didn't just wait in the restaurant, I think I went to explore some other stores in the area. Once we sat down and had a chance to explore the menu, we instantly knew it was worth the wait. They have a large variety of breakfast plates, not all american food (like burritos), lite choices, sweet plates (pancakes, waffles, french toast). Everything sounded great! I ended up going with a salmon plate with poached eggs and toast, and my friend got a really amazing burrito with several different kinds of meats inside. We decided to also split a plate of sweet potato pancakes, which were awesome! I would wait to eat here all over again.
