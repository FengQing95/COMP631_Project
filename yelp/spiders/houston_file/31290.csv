Local Foods////This place is a favorite of my friends and I, but I do have to take one star off because I am very picky about food temperature and sometimes it is a little off here. Once, I ordered the vegan chili and it was served to me so scalding hot that it burnt the skin off about a quarter-sized area of the roof of my mouth which was painful and took around a week to fully heal. To be fair, this was half my fault for not testing it first, but it was still unexpected. After letting it cool off for 10 minutes it was still pretty hot- and I typically like my food hot (just not to the point that it injures me). On a couple other occasions, the duck meat in the duck confit sandwich was served to me lukewarm- I would much prefer it to be served hot, as I feel meat should always be. Other than that, it's a great place. I've tried the duck confit sandwich, crispy chicken sandwich, olive salad, kale, quinoa, chips, acorn squash, and some of the sweets. All of it had excellent flavor and was very fresh. It has a cool, funky atmosphere too- great for a quiet late lunch by yourself, a laid-back dinner date or a weekend lunch on their patio with friends.
