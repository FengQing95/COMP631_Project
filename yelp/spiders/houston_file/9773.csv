JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It seems like the place is packed during mealtimes. Would definitely recommend trying to come during off times. We came around 5:00 to beat the Saturday dinner rush and didn't wait at all. Love that it's open until 2AM on weekends - Houston needs more late night options!
