JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as our seasoned eggs are concerned, we flash boil our eggs before placing them in an ice bath, after which they are marinated for approximately two days. This produces a "custard yolk" rather than a "runny yolk," as you mention. For that preference, we always suggest substituting the seasoned egg for a poached egg, or "Onsen Tamago" for ramen experts such as yourself.
