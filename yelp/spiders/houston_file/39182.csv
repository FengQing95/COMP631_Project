Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The place was absolutely gorgeous and very trendy. They did have a live DJ playing some music however I did think that the music was a little too loud for a Sunday morning. We were seated and provided the menu and unfortunately the menu is not very extensive. We couldn't do much talking because the music was playing a little too loud it literally felt like you were at a club
