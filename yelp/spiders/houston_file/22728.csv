Uchi////Now if you've had good sushi, it's kind of like how you would treat a really good steak. You don't mess with it much. The main philosophy is, let's try to let the ingredients speak for themselves. This can mean that if you have one piece of tuna or yellowtail, it might very well taste exactly (or almost) like another restaurant you've been to. This is only experienced by what we had that night for sushi, but Uchi tries to have a blend of both tradition and avant garde.
