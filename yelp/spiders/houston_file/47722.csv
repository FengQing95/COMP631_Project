Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Another suggestion is to get a side of rocks with your mimosas, or other drinks - ours ended up at the table close to room temperature.  The food itself, as well as the drinks even at room temperature, was seriously delicious and lived up to the hype, and while its probably worth a wait, it was not exactly worth my wait on a weekend - an hour and a half before being seated, and another hour after that before we got our food.  The staff was pleasant, despite the amount of customers they had to serve, and apologetic about the wait for the food.
