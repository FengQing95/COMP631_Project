Baby Barnaby's////The portions are quite large (for all dishes), and usually there's enough to take home for a snack later in the day.  The waffles here are amazing. So fluffy and crispy all at the same time.  The pancakes here are gigantic.  I think the first time I came here, my friend and I made the mistake of each ordering breakfast and then also getting pancakes to share.  The potatoes are perfectly and crisply fried and not too greasy (definite plus).  The huevos rancheros are always delicious, but I tend to lean towards TexMex breakfast everywhere I go.
