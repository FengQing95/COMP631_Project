JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu ramen is awesome. Im a sucker for tender chasu and five minute egg.  I recommend this if it is your first time.  The pork based broth is perfect.  I really enjoy the bouncy noodles.  Thick noodles more fun to eat than the regular ones, which you can switch out if you'd like.
