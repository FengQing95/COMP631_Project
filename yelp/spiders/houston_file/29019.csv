The Pit Room////A solid Texas bbq place with great food and ambience. I'm not an expert at BBQ and have not tried other famous places (e.g Killens, Franklins, etc). But I'm pretty satisfied. I really liked the brisket which was moist and flavored. I'd also recommend trying their seasonal offerings - the day I went they had saut√©ed okra, which I've never had before and turned out to be really good.
