The Pit Room////We arrived with 6 people and decided to share the Feast #1, which came with a little bit of everything.  Loads of brisket, pork ribs, a massive beef rib, 2 kinds of sausages, turkey breast, pulled pork and BBQ chicken with white bread and our choice of sides; we went with the mac & cheese, okra, and baked beans.  My favorite was definitely the brisket and beef rib, but everything was pretty great.  Even the turkey was incredibly moist and none of the meats disappointed.
