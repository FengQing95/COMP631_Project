The Pit Room////SO GOOD. We had all of the tacos (brisket, pulled pork & smoked chicken)... the Mac & Cheese was super cheese and delicious. Walked in starving, left full and super satisfied. Glad we went here on our visit from NY. The staff was kind and helpful in making sure we got the most for our buck. Oh and the self serve sides by the soda machine - the pickle one... couldn't stop eating them!!
