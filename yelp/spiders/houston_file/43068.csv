Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Upscale bakery with great food and a well trained staff. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The only drawback I seen was the pricey items which probably was not pricey for crowd at the Common Bond. $12 for a sausage and egg sandwich and $4 for a cupcake are a little steep for most average working people. Even at those prices, the place stayed busy and people were happy. Parking can be a little tricky as there are not enough parking spaces to support the continuous flow of customers. Besides that, great food, service and experience.
