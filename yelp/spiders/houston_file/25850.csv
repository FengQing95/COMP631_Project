The Pit Room////Today was our first visit and we probably won't be back.  We ordered pork ribs, beef ribs, a sample of all three sausages, beans, potato salad, and cole slaw.  We received brisket instead of sausage and no beans!  The pork ribs were tough, dry and so salty that we could not eat them.  The beef rib was good but small for the price.  The best things we had were the cole slaw and potato salad as well as the homemade pickles and onions.  The cole slaw was good but extra chunky and I have no complaint about the potato salad.  It tastes authentic,  like homemade with great flavor.  Get a salad from this place.  Skip the pork ribs.  Too bad because we love pork ribs and we were really looking forward to them.
