Uchi////This place is for special occasions and when you really wanna #treatyoself. The venue is romantic and the service is always of the utmost quality. Every dish is thoughtfully crafted and full of refined flavors. I really recommend getting the Omakase tasting menu where the chef prepares you a variety of their specialties. The menu can be quite overwhelming so this is really the way to dine at Uchi.
