JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But you really need to come here for the food! We tried the Jinya buns (pork belly bao) and they were incredible. My kids inhaled two each. The crispy chicken was ok (not special compared to rest of menu). The gyoza were good as were the creamy shrimp tempura. The ramen was fantastic - we tried the tonkotsu black and the spicy tonkotsu. The broth was heady and flavorful with tender chasu (pork) and other tasty bits floating in it. The ramen (you can choose between thin and thick noodles) was the right amount of chewy and tender. I prefer the thick noodles but the thin ones were good too.
