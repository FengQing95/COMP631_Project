Uchi////#1 restaurant in Houston hands down. It is a new experience every time I go. Everything is literally so fresh and soooo tasty. Of course it is pricey but it is worth every penny. Sitting at the sushi bar is always nice. All the guys at the sushi bar give off good vibes and make your experience 10 times better.
