Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really enjoyed the pancake flight and the steak Benny.  They showcase a very eclectic menu and a cozy, diner-style eatery.  The wait staff was very friendly.   My only gripe is the wait to be seated because this place is pretty popular.  I do think it's worth the wait though.
