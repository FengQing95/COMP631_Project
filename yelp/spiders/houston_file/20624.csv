Uchi////Incredibly overrated, but still very solid contemporary sushi and tastings restaurant in the heart of terrible - parking town ( midtown ). Reservations are a must for this place as it is booked 2 weeks for weeknights and 3 to 4 weeks on weekends. Average wait time for a walk in can range from 1 hour to 2 hours unless you get lucky and get a sushi bar seat.
