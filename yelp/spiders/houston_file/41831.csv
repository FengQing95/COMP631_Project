Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Good people watching, good coffee, tasty snacks and food.  Prices are not cheap and the parking lot is often overcrowded and annoying to negotiate, but you'll get a prime seat to gnash and watch the trendy montrosians  do their thing.  Get a patio seat and enjoy the outdoors if you can.
