Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The service was friendly and attentive. Constantly came by to refill our mimosas! The only thing that was a bit off was we felt we were being hinted to leave? We weren't done eating yet but they kept asking us if we needed boxes or if we were done. I would understand if it was busy but it was pretty empty. They didn't kick us out or anything, but they did ask us a couple of times.
