Uchi////Anyways, Uchi is very nice and has a great atmosphere. It seems ideal to take a date or get some drinks and sushi with friends. I have to confess I'm probably biased because I generally don't eat sushi or raw fish, but if that's your thing you should probably give this place a try. I don't eat many greens either, but we tried the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and they were fantastic. We got salmon sashimi and it was brought out in a big coconut filled with ice and I believe an umbrella as well, looked neat except for the fact there were only 6 little slices of salmon. I got the pork jowl which again had a lot of fancy decoration but very little food (the food it did have was excellent). The sushi we got were better portioned at least. The waiter was helpful, but the meal did end up being about 2 hours, usually a non-issue but we were all in a bit of a hurry.
