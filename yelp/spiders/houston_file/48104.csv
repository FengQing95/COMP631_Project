Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sigh. What an experience at Snooze. First mistake arriving super late.  Thanks to my always tardy friend.  We signed in at 1, waited for an hour and half.  I ordered the chilaquiles Benedict which were delicious!  Ate them up!  My friend and I shared a pancake flight.  We ordered pineapple upside down,  blueberry and  ginger French toast. The French toast was a dream, it was like cake. However,  I didn't like the pancakes. I thought they were doughy and undercooked.
