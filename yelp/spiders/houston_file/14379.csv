JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Should you return in the near future, please ask for me or any of my managers (Keith, Wynne, Kathy) and we can assist you in selecting a ramen to your liking.  I'm a big fan of our Tonkotsu White myself.  It's blend of chicken and pork broth with thin noodles and chashu pork on top.
