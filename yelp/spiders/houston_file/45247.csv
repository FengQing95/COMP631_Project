Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Really long line on weekends but that's what you get when it's an amazing place to eat/be. All of the pastries are amazing and they have macaroon flavors I've never seen anywhere else. I've never tried anything here that I didn't like but specifically the quiche Lorraine is exquisite. I had the tamale Benedict today and it was great the tamales were just a tad dry but I'm a tough tamale critic given that I'm Mexican lol The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of this and also I wish they had gluten-free pastries.
