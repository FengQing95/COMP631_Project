The Pit Room////I didn't think there would be better BBQ than Franklin but pit room proved me wrong. It already won Franklin with better briskets and tastier sides but the caviar on top was no wait! I can't believe how long we waited to try Franklin before and now this delicious BBQ is open without any wait! To be fair, Franklin was probably the father of great Texan BBQ.
