Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The space and ambiance is fun and the food seems generally high quality (and looks gorgeous). However, I found it somewhat expensive -- $16.24 for an egg sandwich and an 8 oz. OJ (albeit fresh squeezed) was just ridiculous. I also didn't like that I wasn't able to change the bread option on the sandwich -- which is kinda lousy given that the menu is pretty limited already. And while the overall flavors of the sandwich were good, Â I didn't apperciate the undercooked egg.
