JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This time round I got the vegetarian ramen with thick noodles. The broth was hot and wholesome, the noodles were tasty and the cauliflowers, spinach and cabbage kept me full for the rest of the evening. To top it all off, the ratio of broth to noodles was perfect--we've all had that moment when we're forced to eat cold noodles because there's like two tablespoons of broth. Jinya won't betray you, trust me.
