Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Upon my request for dine in the cashier goes "Did you wait in the line outside?" to my shock and embarrassment. I let her know I didn't notice the line. She said she would have to "check" with the people outside to see if it's okay for me to have a seat, and to go wait at the bar.
