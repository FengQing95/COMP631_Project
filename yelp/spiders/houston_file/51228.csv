Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We usually frequent the Heights location but ended coming here since we only had about an hour till closing. Lucky for us, we got a (parallel) parking spot right on the street in front of Snooze. They've got a small parking lot right next to the restaurant. As we walked towards the door, I noticed that their patio section looked small. Once inside, we got our name on the list and just stood around waiting. It's a tiny waiting area. There's a little coffee bar set up so you can grab a complimentary cup of coffee while you wait for a table to become available. From my vantage point at the front, I could see that this is indeed a small location. They've got a good amount of booths and tables but it doesn't look that big of a space. I like that they keep a big space clear in the middle so it's not all cramped when walking to your table or to leave. The bar area has seating for nine plus one handicapped spot. They have the usual round curving booths we see in all Snooze locations. This time, even though it was just the three of us, we were able to get one of those large round booths!
