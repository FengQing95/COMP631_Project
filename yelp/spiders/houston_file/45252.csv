Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Sausage and Egg Sandwich - if you're coming for brunch and it's your first time - get this. Hands down the best breakfast sandwich I've experienced. A perfectly poached egg on pork sausage with white cheddar, aioli, and greens all loaded onto a fresh sesame roll.
