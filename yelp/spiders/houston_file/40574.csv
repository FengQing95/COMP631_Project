Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Didn't get the opportunity to try anything.  Tried calling before I drove over half an hour just to make it here 30 minutes before closing.... however NO ANSWER.  So I just took the chance.  Upon arrival it appears to be closed, chairs and stools stacked.  But I viewed a couple inside.  Went in.  Was inform the bar open till 1:45am. But kitchen closed at 11pm.
