JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tiffany - Thank you for your great review. I, too, regret that parking around the entire MIX at Midtown complex is not better. However, if you drive around the neighborhood, I think you'll find our garage is the only place that doesn't charge a fee. In fact, the valet service is free, though the employees do work for tips.
