Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So the manager comes over (shorter lady with reddish hair, very nice by the way) and says "you're trying to order a drink?" My friend and I look at each other like what is she talking about. I said no I already ordered I don't know if she couldn't hear or what but then she proceeds to ask me for my ID. I'm looking at her like umm no. I tell her I already ordered a drink awhile ago. She says oh I was told you were trying to order a drink and there's a carding issue. I proceed to tell her the real situation and she understood, we laugh about it and keep it moving.
