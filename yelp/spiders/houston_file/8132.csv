JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great food and great service. Great place. The place was bustling. Atmosphere modern and moody. The open kitchen in the back was kinetic and energy was high. Service was fast and efficient Â but friendly and helpful. The star was the black bowl of porky goodness, no.1 was number one in my books.. The jinya bun was fantastic. The chicken was crispy as promised but quickly lost its texture as it cooled. Chasu pork rice bowl was comforting and familiar. Takoyaki were average.
