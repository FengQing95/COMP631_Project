JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu.  The broth was ok, but the noodles were too al dente.  The meat was was way overcooked which made it mushy.  We also ordered the takoyaki which was a big fat MEH.  Also, we had to ask twice for an extra bowl and again twice for extra chopsticks.  Who brings you an extra bowl without chopsticks?
