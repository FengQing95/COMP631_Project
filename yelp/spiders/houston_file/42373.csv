Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time trying this place out! I read the past reviews on how pack it gets in the morning, so I arrived at 8:40 and there was a few people already waiting. They opened the doors at 9, and the service was fast. I ordered the chocolate croissant, vanilla latte, oj, pain perdu (not all for me). The food was so good! I would recommend this bakery to anyone! Service was so friendly and cheery, the ambiance was so cute and modern, and food was delicious. I can't wait to return!
