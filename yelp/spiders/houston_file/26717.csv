The Pit Room////A smaller joint for sure located in the upper Kirby area this is a great place to stop by for lunch or after work for some good BBQ. There is a parking lot in the back so don't be fooled by the limited parking up front. I've heard this place can run out of meat if you get here too late so make sure to come early and come hungry. Right as you walk in you're greeted by friendly faces and the aroma of delicious, melts, fall-off-the-bone, Smokey, meat. There's a wide variety of selection including the usual ribs, brisket, and sausage. I don't recommend the feast platters as the quantity of sides included was rather weak. If you're gonna get it I would add at least two or three more orders of sides as our group found ourselves fighting over the limited potato salad and Mac and cheese. The meat itself was quite tasty and a few of us took the rib bones home to give to our dogs.
