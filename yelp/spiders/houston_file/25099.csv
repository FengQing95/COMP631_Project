Uchi////Came to Uchi for my mom's birthday back in December, and we had a wonderful experience. The waiter we had was super friendly, patient, and helpful cause it was my family's first time, and we wanted some recommendations as to what to order (on top of what family friends had suggested to us). In order to sample a bit of everything, we decided to go with the omakase signature tastings and then order some of our own picks. Although my parents aren't super informed about sushi, they loved the experience and the food. Because of how happy they were, I also enjoyed the experience. I will say the food was definitely delicious and was complimented by excellent service. One thing to note is the restaurant seems to always be pretty busy, even on weekday nights! We went on a Monday night with a reservation and still had to wait on the back patio for 20 or so minutes. Wasn't too troubling though cause we got some drinks in the meantime.
