JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Loved the atmosphere here. It's pretty loud on a Sunday night, and they have music playing, but its the kind of mood we were looking for on a night out. We ordered the octopus which was so good. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavorful. I had the JINYA tonkotsu ramen with pork. It lots of flavor, not salty, or bland. Also, the Lycheetini is my new favorite drink! Strong and not too sweet. I loved it and would absolutely come back!
