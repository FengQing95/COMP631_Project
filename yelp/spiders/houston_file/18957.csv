Uchi////** SERVICE: From start to finish, Uchi's employees were a total delight. The hostesses greeted us immediately with dashing smiles, waiters patiently and happily answered our questions, and the bartenders were friendly and awesome dudes. What really struck me was how knowledgeable everyone was about Uchi's menu - while we were waiting and having a few pre-dinner drinks at the bar, even the bartenders were able to explain, suggest, and "wow" us with their food expertise. Everyone was SUPER nice - I really felt like I was at home, chatting with friends over a glass of wine. I can honestly say, my beau and I had THE most wonderful time!
