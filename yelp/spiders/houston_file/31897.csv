Local Foods////I can't wait to go back! Stumbled upon Local Foods on Yelp and decided to try it out because of all the amazing reviews. I was not let down! The food was delicious! I ordered the smoked salmon sandwhich with the slaw and chips and my boyfriend had the truffle egg salad with couscous and ratatouille. I loved both sandwhiches, maybe the salmon more than the other. Both were very fresh and full of flavor. The portions were perfect and I finished all my food without being overly stuffed. The flavor of the slaw was definately asian inspired and it was the best side out of all 4 that I tried. The couscous and ratatouille were a little salty for my taste but good nonetheless. The concept of this restaurant is great and so was the service. I seriously can't wat to go back and try their other sandwhiches. 2 thumbs up!
