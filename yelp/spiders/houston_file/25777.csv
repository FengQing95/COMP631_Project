The Pit Room////Lived in both Houston and Kansas City so I'm usually very critical of BBQ, but this was hands down a Top 3 spot I've ever been to. Great house made sauce to go with perfectly cooked meats. The tacos were amazing, each have a great different flavor. We had a large party so we got to taste everything and I was impressed more and more throughout the meal. I will definitely be coming back
