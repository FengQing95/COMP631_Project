The Pit Room////Nice to have a solid BBQ joint in the museum district/Montrose neighborhood. I had the 2 meat dinner that comes with 2 sides and a slice of bread. It's a large portion that could easily be shared by 2 people. Had the brisket, pork ribs, sautéed okra, and mustard potato salad. The brisket was moist, tender, delicious, and had a nice wood smoked flavor. The pork ribs were a bit dry and could be a more tender. The okra was nice and was refreshing to see it prepared different from most other places in town. The potato salad was a bit on the tangy side and nothing to write home about. The BBQ sauce was tasty and on point.
