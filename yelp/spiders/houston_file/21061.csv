Uchi////So here is my view... service was great!  Waiter was friendly and helpful, dirty dishes were picked up quickly and food came out pretty quickly.  The food was unique and tasty but we left feeling unsatisfied... I am glad we came during their happy hour because their prices are pretty high for the small tastings.  We are glad we came and tried it but probably won't be back.  Our bill was $150 for 2 people and to be honest, we left debating if it would be wrong to drive through Whataburger on the way home.
