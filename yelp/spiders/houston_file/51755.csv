Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my favorite breakfast places food is always fresh and tasty. You may choose to drink healthy or have the tradition breakfast fare or spiked. The service is always friendly and prompt. The outdoor seating is a nice option when you want to have more conversation less music. Also nice when it cools down. Like the fact that almost any dish can be vegetarian. Kids is good too as one is usually limited to one type of pancake etc not here. Overall a really nice vibe and place to brunch considering it's a chain it still hasn't lost its unique appeal
