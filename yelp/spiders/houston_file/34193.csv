Local Foods////Local Foods offered some interesting foods, although at slightly higher pricing in my opinion. On my first trip there, I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich (About $12 with two sides or a soup), and was honestly shocked at how delicious and fresh the sandwich was. I was initially expecting a very dried salmon, but instead, the sandwich was filled with smoked, almost sashimi-style salmon slices!
