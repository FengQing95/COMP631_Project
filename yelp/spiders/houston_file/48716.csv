Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My table of coworkers split the carrot cake (pancake of the day) and sweet potato pancakes for an appetizers because if having pancakes before your meal is wrong, I don't want be right. I would highly suggest doing the same when you go. The sweet potato pancakes were REALLY REALLY sweet ... like a flat sweet potato cake. The carrot cake pancakes melted our cold, cold hearts. Oh they were divine. Best pancakes ever.*
