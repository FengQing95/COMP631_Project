Kata Robata////Kata Robata is a solid sushi choice in the loop and centrally located. Make a reservation because they are ALWAYS busy. Â I really enjoy the lobster mac n cheese here. They've got a variety of awesome rolls. Service is usually very rushed here since they've got a log of customers waiting to be seated. Their happy hour menu is awesome. I think I've only been here for happy hour. They've got a huge selection of sushi rolls at the discounted price.
