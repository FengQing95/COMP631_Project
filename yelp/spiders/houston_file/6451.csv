JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For my entree I went with one of their daily specials and it was perfectly satisfying.  A nice spicy heat with full pork flavors.  I'm not sure exactly what "authentic" ramen is, but this place certainly impressed me.  They lost a star for my Saturday night experience, but the food was memorable.  I'd go back, but only on a weeknight.
