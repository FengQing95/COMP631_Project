JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu Spicy (Hot)- a spicy version of the tonkotsu broth, obviously, that comes in three heats: normal, spicy, hot. I ordered the spiciest heat and I'm pretty sure the only difference between the heats is how much sriracha they use. Since mine was the "spiciest" the broth was served to me too thick and gave a my mouth an odd aftertaste due to the over-abundance of sriracha.
