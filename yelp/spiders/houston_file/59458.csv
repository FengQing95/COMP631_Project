Baby Barnaby's////Very good and fresh food. I had the French Toast and it was delicious. My husband had the Breakfast Plate and says it was very good the over medium eggs were cooked perfect and the bacon is thick slab delicious bacon! We highly recommend buy know: we arrived at 8:50 and the line was formed outside waiting on them to open. The staff: super friendly, attentive and wants everyone to truly enjoy the atmosphere! I'll return when back in Houston!
