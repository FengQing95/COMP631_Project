Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Delicious. Three of us had a difficult time choosing there were so many options. We picked unique dishes and we were all pleased with what we order. The portions were large. Food was prepared well. Cost is a little on the high side. At first it seemed parking was difficult but there is another lot behind the building. Can't wait to take my wife here.
