Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm not a huge fan of brunch but I kept hearing rave reviews about this place so a couple of my friends and I tried it out. I had the Sweet Potato Pancakes, I thought it was too heavy and sweet. It was ok but nothing spectacular. I felt the same with the french toast. Â It wasn't worth the wait in my opinion. It's also so hard to find parking and the wait on the weekends could get up to 1 hr or more. I'll have to try the savory dishes next time.
