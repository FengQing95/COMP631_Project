JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Unfortunately I live in an area of zero ramen options (we are talking real Japanese Ramen here not college dorm staples).  So to happen upon Jinya because they were a late night option in Houston was such a welcomed surprise.  If you haven't eaten here you are really missing out.  The service is attentive and helpful, and the ramen options are utterly fantastic.  The restaurant has a great welcoming vibe and was quite relaxing and enjoyable.  I highly recommend adding the (free!) garlic to your ramen, and go crazy with it, you won't be disappointed!  We enjoyed it so much we hit it up two nights in a row, top notch, I will return.  Cheers Jinya!
