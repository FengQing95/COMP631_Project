JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is so much better than Tiger Den and Ramen Jin. I usually get a tonkotsu and the blend of flavors are so perfect. Not salty like TD and not bland like RJ. It's just right! The line does get long at night so I come either in the afternoon or a little before rush hour. Price a little on the pricey side but it's definitely worth it!
