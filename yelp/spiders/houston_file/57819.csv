Kata Robata////After craving sushi for a month, we decided to go there for the first time. The service in this place is amazing, not only are the servers friendly and nice, they are knowledgeable about Japanese food and give good recommendations. We got Salmon slices as appetizers which were tender and beautifully marinated. After that we ordered pieces based on their recommendations all of which were beautifully made and delicious. Someone in our table ordered Â non seafood items and loved their beef skewers. We tried their lobster Mac and cheese too which was great, but not a typical choice for me as I do not want to fill up on Mac instead of good fish. Finally their tres leches dessert was probably the fluffiest and lightest tres leches I had tried. Easy to go down after a meal with low sugar.
