Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love the atmosphere here but the food selections are lacking. I am not a whiskey drinker however the bar is a very inviting and fun place. I feel like their food just doesn't match the trendy step up atmosphere they created. It just isn't a menu that encourages you to stick around for dinner.
