Uchi////The menu is incredible, and you pretty much can't go wrong with any dish. There's some dishes that have stood the test of time since the original Austin opening, and some new ones from Cole's flavor experiments. Experiment is a good descriptor. The purpose of Uchi is supposed to be a daring, yet traditional, take on sushi. I wouldn't define it strictly as fusion, but it's not going to have a Japanese-only menu plastered to the wall, either.
