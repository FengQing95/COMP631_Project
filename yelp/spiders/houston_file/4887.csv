JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the ramen assari and the boyfriend ordered the tonkotsu black. Had I only tasted the assari this review would easily be 4 stars. The thick noodles in the assari were divine. The perfect texture of chewiness and noodle-y goodness was excellent and the broth was super tasty. I added in a few heaps of spicy sauce but overall the broth wasn't too bad. The chashu was very fatty and the egg was slightly overdone.
