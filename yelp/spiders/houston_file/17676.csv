Uchi////The food was fantastic. Of course, the portion is not Texas size, but everything was fresh, creative and delicious. My husband is a big eater, so between the two of us, we spent 250 for appetizer, about 8 dishes, a bottle of Saki and dessert. Definitely not your everyday diner, but a nice spot for when you have a hanker for contemporary Japanese food.
