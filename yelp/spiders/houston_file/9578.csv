JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen. The toppings are very good, on par with other hot ramen spots. The broth has good flavor, however, it is not nearly as full and rich as other ramen places. It's almost oily and pretty watered down. I have to get the garlic broth instead of just the regular tonkatsu in order to taste much. And on top of the broth, I'm just not a big fan of the noodles. I'm not a ramen expert or anything, but they have almost a rubbery consistency..kind of reminds me of gnocchi, which I don't think ramen noodles are supposed to be like. Don't get me wrong, I actually do still enjoy it, but it's just not up to par with other ramen establishments.
