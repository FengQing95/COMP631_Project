JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi June - Thanks for your review. Although the bulk of our fare is ramen, we do have quite a few non-ramen options such as the pork and chicken chashu bowls, the Tokyo Curry Rice, or an array of crowd-pleasing tapas dishes. For folks who consider our broth too salty, I always suggest requesting less salt, or modifying it however they see fit. And considering that your friends offered you "rave reviews" before your visit, I suppose it's fair to say that sometimes expectation can become the cousin of disappointment. Regardless, we appreciate your trying us out at least twice before posting your review.
