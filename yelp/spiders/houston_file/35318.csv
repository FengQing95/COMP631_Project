Local Foods////I ordered the Bacon Steak and Egg sandwich with beet salad and sweet potato salad on the side. I have to say that the sandwich was amazing, albeit an artery-clogging risk. In it were skirt steak, applewood bacon, runny egg, and spicy aioli all on a bilillo roll. The beet salad was sweet, but can be a questionable choice for some people. The sweet potato salad was really good and creamy.
