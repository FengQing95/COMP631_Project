Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been enough that I've tried almost their whole menu already. Haha. My personal favorites include the barbeque porchetta sandwich, cajun brick chicken, 12 hour short rib, and bosscat burger. But really, I like it all. In terms of drinks, my favorite is the Kentucky Orange Blossom. I'm a sucker for elderflower. If you want something more "boozy" in flavor, I would go with the Revolver or the 38 Special.
