Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I loved the vibe of Common Bond. I was instantly greeted when I walked in and the presentation was nice. I ordered a cookie and a almond milk latte. The cookie was good, I def wasn't disappointed. Latte was wonderful and the barista was great!! Customer service is A plus! Prices are regular pastry bakery prices. I will definitely return.
