JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Quick notes, this was my first time trying ramen. If you're curious, to me it's like the Pho fad part 2 or the Japanese version. I say that not to disparage either Pho or Ramen, but to point out that it's just another phase of the same fad. But thanks to the lovely people of Vietnam and Japan for sharing your delicious food with us and glad you can reap the benefits as long as our miniscule attention spans will allow!
