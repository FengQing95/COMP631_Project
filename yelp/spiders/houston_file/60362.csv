Baby Barnaby's////There seemed to be only one server inside and one outside, but they were handling their sections like bosses. We tried the waffle, the breakfast, the green eggs, the steak and eggs, and the tacos, all of which were extremely delicious! The potatoes and black beans were my favorite! I look forward to returning!!
