Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////. Also tried their huevos tostadas. It was okay. The salsa added had a lot of cumin in it. A bit overpowering. And Oh my god their sausage patties are delicious. Especially the chorizo sausage patty! That was the highlight. They also have a full open bar all week. I will be back.
