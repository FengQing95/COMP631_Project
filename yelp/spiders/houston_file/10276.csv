JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Takoyaki- octopus balls. I was surprised that the portion was really large. I think there were like six pieces, instead of four/five like other places. Their takoyaki didn't really live up to my expectations considering how pretty it looked. Idk, it just didn't taste as good compared to what I've had before.
