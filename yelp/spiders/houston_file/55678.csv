Kata Robata////The dinner was absolutely amazing. There was a decent wine selection, the atmosphere was comfortable and not too noisy. Â It was obvious that there were quite a few "regulars" in our midst that love dining here. The dinner pushed my boundaries (and my husbands) just a bit - and I am better for it! ;)
