Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is by far my favorite place,  the wait is long,  but well worth it.  All the Benny dishes are delicious!! Bacon is on point,  I prefer to sit at the bar, the waitresses there are very welcoming and talkative.  Love the vibe of this place, as the food is fantastic! They just need to make one closer to my house.  Lol
