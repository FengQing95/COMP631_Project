JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We greatly appreciate your feedback. Over the years I have visited dozens of ramen shops worldwide, and I've spent as little as $8 for a bowl of ramen and as much as $20. What I have learned is that each ramen shop is unique in its own way -- from the noodles and broth they use, to the side dishes they serve, to the price points they target. To that end, I believe JINYA offers a premium product at a competitive price, and I can tell you with no exaggeration that a very great deal of work goes into (and has gone into) serving a single bowl of JINYA ramen. And for that I will forever stand by our product and services.
