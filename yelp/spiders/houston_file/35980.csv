Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As I was previously a server, I feel as though I can judge the quality of service pretty fairly. Our server was nice, but was very slow. Although it was a busy night, the server was able to visit her other tables while ignoring us. This happens sometimes since we are young and people don't expect us to tip (even though we tip 20% or higher for good service), but doesn't make it acceptable. Since our dinner order wasn't taken until after we FINISHED our appetizer, we should have foregone an entree. However, the poutine we got as an appetizer was all right so we decided to order. Our entrees were bland and over-priced. The Cajun chicken was overcooked. We ended up paying $90 for a meal that we were overall unsatisfied with.
