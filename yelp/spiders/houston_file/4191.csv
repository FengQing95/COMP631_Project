JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We visited this place for anniversary. The ramen is fantastic yummy and the price is reasonable in downtown area. But we will not get combination next time since it is not worth it. We also ordered almond tofu for desert which is delicious. I highly recommend this place.
