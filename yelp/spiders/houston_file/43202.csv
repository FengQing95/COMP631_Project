Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The staff is very helpful and attentive.  I was having a hard time picking a pie without buying and eating 3 to myself and a helpful young man steered me down the right path!   Apple was a real delight!!!  Not so much buttermilk, it wasn't how it was made - I'm just not a fan of that genre of pie.  I'll return next time I need a pie or 3!
