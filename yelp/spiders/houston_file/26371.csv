The Pit Room////For starters, the tacos are slightly pricey (around 4.24-4.75), but they are quite big - I quickly realized that one was enough for me. My only real complaint was that the meat needed to have some liquid drained off before putting it into the tortilla.  I enjoyed the chicken and the brisket, then when I returned I had just the chicken again. There is a pork taco, that is probably excellent; however, I'm currently not eating pork by choice. The meat has some great smoke on it, and the condiments are ample. They pre-melt the cheese that goes on the chicken taco, which makes it even better. The tortillas are made in house, from what is seemed, as well as the salsa and escabeche.  These are all things that make me happy.
