Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got the daily board selection, which included baguette, sunflower rye and multigrain. Not such a huge fan of the baguette; I much prefer seeded/multigrain bread. The sunflower rye and multigrain (has poppy seeds) were really filling. The board came with jam, cream cheese and butter. The jam was too sweet for me. I think it would be nice if they offered different types of jam. I thought the breads tasted good but there wasn't anything too special about it.
