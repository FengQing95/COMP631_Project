Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place charges for their location - cocktails averaged $14, but they made up for it tonight with service and (important for me) fabulous bathrooms.    One small thing - their single malt whiskies come in very inexpensive rocks glasses. If you're gonna charge a high price, I'd think appropriate glassware would be an important touch. Can't wait to see how this place does a year from now - hopefully they can settle into the Houston market successfully.
