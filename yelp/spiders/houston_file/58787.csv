Baby Barnaby's////After looking over the endless option on the menu, I decided on the green eggs for breakfast. It was a bit too undercooked for my liking with the egg whites, spinach, and artichokes being too watery to really hold together. It was a great thought and an ambitious try, but it lacked the flavor and consistency of a truly good egg dish. It was served with room temperature toast and hard to choke down chicken sausage. I'm not a fan of chicken to begin with, so this was an unpleasant experience to swallow.
