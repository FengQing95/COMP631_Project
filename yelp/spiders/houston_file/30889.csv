The Pit Room////With all the Yelp stars to review ratio, I knew I was most likely in for a line. As our Lyft arrived, there was a line, but it wasn't too bad. The Houston humidity was surprisingly not too bad, so our wait didn't seem awful at all. I'd never been, but knew I wanted to try Houston BBQ since I know different parts of TX have different BBQs.
