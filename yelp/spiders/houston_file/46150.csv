Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you tryna come here for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday like I did, good luck... it is packed-and for good reason!  My friend and I quickly got in line and started to look at the menu and drool over the fresh pastries on display.  That pistachio croissant looked so freaking good, I knew I had to order one.  In addition to that, I also ordered a croque madame and a latte for dine-in.  After paying, the cashier handed me a number for my order and as I began to look around the room, I got scared that we wouldn't be able to find a seat.  However, an employee gestured me over and said that there was a table so phew!!!
