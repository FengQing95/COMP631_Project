JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Walked in and sat immediately down which was cool; however, it was a real strange smell-like sewer. We stayed anyway-probably shouldn't have. Â We ordered Gyoza as an appetizer and then our main course Spicy Chicken Ramen. It took a longer time time than usual for us to get them. Well we couldn't enjoy the Gyoza because it came out 30 seconds before our main dishes. So went sent them back. I wouldn't have been so ticked but the resturant was not even half full and the majority of associates were in the back or standing by the kitchen bar in a place where they were hidden from the customers view -some on their phones.
