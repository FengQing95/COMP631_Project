The Pit Room////Texas Monthly rates Pit Room as some of the best in Texas and they are right.  The brisket is so good, their homemade sausage - all three varieties, venison, beef, pork with cheese and jalapeños - are worth a trip all by themselves.  As is the beef rib.  The pork ribs.  The turkey.  The chicken is especially good.  ( before you start think "how much could one guy eat? I should mention that I've been several times, and even had them cater lunches at my office). They make all the sides in-house, including their own pickles.  And pickled jalapeños.  And, something you can't get anywhere else, pickled green onions.  Almost always a line, you might sit at a long table with random people, but you will leave full and with new friends.  Go as often as you can - you won't be sorry.
