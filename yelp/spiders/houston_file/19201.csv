Uchi////I just want to start off by saying that I'm not the type to ever give reviews but our experience tonight was by far one of the best we have ever had! We let our sushi chef, Cameron, pick our meals for us and were not disappointed by any of his choices, and that's coming from two people who have very high expectations for sushi! The service was impeccable. The attention to detail given to even the smallest things from the organization of tickets in the receipt holder, to the fact that my napkin was swapped while I was in the restroom and I didn't even ask. It really is the little things that make or break a great experience like this. Everyone was kind and knowledgeable whenever we had questions about anything. The nuances of the food were unlike any other sushi experience we've ever had. The order in which Cameron decided to serve our dishes were meticulously planned in accordance with our appetite in mind going from the lightest plates to the heaviest dishes and topped off with dessert. The food was prepared in such a fashion that no other complimentary condiments (e.g. wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce) were needed, as expected with any dish you would have at a high-end restaurant. If you are accustomed to eating at lower-end restaurants, the price may be a little hefty for your budget, however the quality is well worth the money that you will spend here. We did not expect the price ($300) to come out as low as it did for the amount of dishes that we were served; 17 dishes for two people including dessert and excluding drinks. We highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar for a more personal experience catered better to your taste and accommodated with the sushi chefs recommendations. I am from out of town visiting my boyfriend and let me say that it has been a really great and memorable experience.
