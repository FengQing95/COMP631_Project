Uchi////We decided on the Chef's Tasting - 10 course Omakase. For starters the brussel sprouts which were crispy with a lemon-y finish. My gosh, these little bundles were so delicious & live up to all the hype. I'm pretty fuzzy on most of the things we had (thanks to the 2 bottles of wine we killed, no worries H was the designated driver). Mostly fusion creations, each lovingly & beautifully plated. Pork belly, sushi with fruit, quinoi with beef (sounds funky but was good) & for dessert we each got a trio of bite sized desserts.
