JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Looking at the menu for ramen was confusing here I didn't know what to order since I'm used to Tiger Den's non-extensive menu lol but we asked the waitress what was popular which was the tonkatsu black ramen so my boyfriend ordered it and I wanted something of a pork and chicken mix so she recommended the Tokyo Tatai Ramen and haven't regretted it.
