JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hands down the best Ramen joint in town thus far (and I have pretty much tried them all) If I'm having my ramen hankering, I'll come here because it's consistently delicious and never disappoints. Can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review for this place because I used to come at least once a week. Now due to it's popularity, it gets packed quick so be prepared to wait at least 30 mins or stalk out a bar seat.
