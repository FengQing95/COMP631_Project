JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For Houston, this is an acceptable location for ramen. I shared a Jinya Tonkotsu Black with a friend, so the waiter provided an additional bowl for splitting. The broth was full flavored and neither too salty nor too bland. Noodles were cooked to the right consistency - they had a bounce and weren't soggy, as can be the case when they're cooked just a minute over. However, the pork chashu was too fatty for my liking, and the egg was not as runny as I generally prefer my onsen tamago. All subjective complaints, however, so I would recommend a visit to just test the waters and see for yourself.
