Baby Barnaby's////I've had this place bookmarked for sooooo long and I went here before on a Sunday morning on a rainy day (Sunday mornin', rain is fallin', sorry I love that song lol) but the wait was too long and just woke up so I was hungry so we went next door to eat at Barnaby's Cafe. I was kind of disappointed because I really want to try this place out but what can I do? Business was busy.
