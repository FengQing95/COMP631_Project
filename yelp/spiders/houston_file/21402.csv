Uchi////Our first split meals were the Hirame usuzukuri (thinly sliced flounder, candied quinoa, olive oil) for me and the Kinoko usuzukuri (seasonal mushroom, shallot, shiro zu). They were like the mirrored versions of the same dish except hers was vegetarian. Bright clean flavors to start off the night with.
