Uchi////If I were just to review the food, it would get at least 4 stars. However my experience was bad for a group party. I will never work with the "event planner" again. It is so disappointing that I had mostly good food (machi cure, yokai berry, bacon tataki, pork jowl, brussel sprouts and some of the daily specials) and I left the restaurant with a bad taste in my mouth.
