The Pit Room////We ordered the brisket and pork ribs (holy crap the ribs!) with charro beans and mustard potato salad. This 2 meat plate was enough for the both of us to share! Also found out you can order the brisket as "moist" which we will definitely be coming back to do. Could not be happier with the service, food, and patio!
