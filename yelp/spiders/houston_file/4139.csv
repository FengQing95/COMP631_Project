JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The takoyaki was really good, freshly made and hot, with a nice crisp exterior and soft inside. The octopus pieces were not too chewy. Among the best takoyaki we've had. The bao was ok--decent flavor but the pork belly was not quite as melt-in-your-mouth as I like, but that could be just my preference.
