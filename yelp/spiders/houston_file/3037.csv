JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had Tokyo tonkatsu ramen and it was pretty good. You can definitely taste the fish powder which is very umami.  I also added bamboo and spinach to make it more substantial.  The bamboo didn't taste good at all. I told them about it and they took it off the bill. Service is very good. Parking is tricky for first timer. I circled around the building twice before I realized that you can park in the building........
