Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////French toast: perfect. Cooked just right, not underdone in the center. Â Perfect amount of cinnamon. Strawberries were heavenly- they'd been soaked in vanilla. Syrup was delightfully light. Bacon was great. You have no idea how much I've been wanting to find perfect French toast ~ and here it is!!!
