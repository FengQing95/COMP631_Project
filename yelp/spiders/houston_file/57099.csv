Kata Robata////My favorite roll is the rising sun because, well... who doesn't love truffle? Â All of their sushi is super fresh - from salmon to hamachi (yellowtail) & jalapeno, to spicy chopped scallop, to fatty tuna. My mouth is literally watering. They also have an amberjack sashimi that they serve w/ foie gras that is absolutely amazing. There are so many options, and honestly, I've never had anything bad there. Don't forget to get some A5 wagyu sashimi too! Best in town!
