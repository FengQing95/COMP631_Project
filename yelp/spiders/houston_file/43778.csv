Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////On the downside, their coffee (regular) is not my favorite and I hate that the patio is right at the corner of a busy street. Another thing is that everything is really expensive. But it doesn't mean that I won't stop by sometimes (since it is the best coffee shop between my apartment and my work)
