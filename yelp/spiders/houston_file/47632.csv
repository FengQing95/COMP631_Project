Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great food, really good sized portion for the money you pay. They have a variety of sauces to choose from, which are all really good from what I have tasted so far. The one downside is the wait time. it did take us a bit long to get us seated. but other than that, nice cozy restaurant.
