JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went to this location for the first time last week. Great service and delicious ramen. I usually go to the one in Austin, TX at the Domain shopping center. I'm obsessed with the ramen here and I think the location it is in is very cute. I always get the black ramen and my boyfriend likes to get the vegan ramen add chashu! Parking is pretty hard to find..it took me a while. But other than that, very flavorful ramen.
