Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went to Board at for the first time tonight and it was an amazing experience. Terry was very energetic and provided superior customer service. Terry was great and thoroughly explained the menu and was friendly with everyone at our table. He went over drinks and food items. I took his recommendation and ordered the boss burger with fries chef style and it was delicious! Everything was well worth it and I'll definitely be going back.
