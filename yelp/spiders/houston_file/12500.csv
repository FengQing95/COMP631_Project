JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My uncle loves this place! He comes all the time! Finally, after seeing all of his pictures and posts of every time he comes here, it's grown on me! Great ramen in downtown! Fast service! I recommend, to sit at the bar or order to-go sometimes it can get cramped. I generally spend about $14 and leave at least a $5 tip.
