Uchi////Most of their dishes come with their own specific sauces, which is really cool even though they can be hit or miss.  The fish is super fresh and knife work is excellent... But you should have some fun with the "tasting" plates to appreciate the creativity and thought that goes into these dishes!  You can get your regular sushi fix somewhere else.
