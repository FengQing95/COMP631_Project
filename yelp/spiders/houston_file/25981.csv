The Pit Room////New place off of Richmond. The parking kinda sucks but the BBQ makes it all okay! You order at the counter. Don't be discouraged if the line is out the door. The food is served cafeteria style and the line takes no time at all. The okra was SO GOOD and we had a variety of meats that were so juicy and flavorful. The service is on point. You can tell the management and workers really take pride in the place and want to give you great service and the best experience possible.
