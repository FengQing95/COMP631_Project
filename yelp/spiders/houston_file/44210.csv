Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In the video I said hot coffee, but I meant hot chocolate. The Valrhona Hot Chocolate is good and tasty, but I have never had great beverages at Common Bond. It's good and convenient, I'm glad it's there, but I'd just go there for their beverages. I prefer my home made Hershey's 100% Hot Cocoa better.
