The Pit Room////Food was really good, i got the 1 meat and 2 sides, i chose the pork ribs, potato salad (which was made CORRECTLY, and mustard based NOT mayo) and a cucumber/tomato salad. It was really good. Ate outside at "the patio".. Music was whatever but the people were nice and the drinks were on happy hour... I'd return again to try a sandwich .. overall a good experience
