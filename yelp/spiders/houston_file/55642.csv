Kata Robata////A divided review for Kata Robata. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner on a Monday; definitely off-peak. We were seated promptly under an air duct piping in drafts straight from the heart of the deep tundra in January; it was unbearably cold. Clearly, if they keep complementary shawls on hand for chilly diners, they might consider retooling the central cooling system.
