Local Foods////I am in love with place.  I go weekly and sometimes more often.  I always get their crunchy chicken sandwich. Its a 5/5 in my book!!!  I cant describe it only that you MUST try it. I always love their sides which usually change frequently.  I get the Kale always and then whatever is the new selection (you get 2 with your sandwich).  Their seasonal soups make me warm and fuzzy.  Right now they have a lemongrass chicken soup that is perfect for this weather...its creamy and savory and yum yum yum.  I always get the salad that has egg and beetsand chicken...its delish.  The vibe is cool...great decor....the cooks and counter guys are cute...the food is killer!!!!! What's not to love?
