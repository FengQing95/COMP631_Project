JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the setup of the restaurant: intimate and cozy. Seating for two, booth style is along the wall and tables for bigger parties in the middle. Whenever a guest comes in, the staff greet them with a welcome chat. I can't make out what they are saying, but it is pretty cool! Â
