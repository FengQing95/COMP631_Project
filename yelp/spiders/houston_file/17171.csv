JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let's be honest. When you think of Ramen in Houston you think of Jinya first and then you look up their competition to try something new. Jinya just has top notch service altogether and their vibe in the midtown location is really nice. There is nothing more relaxing then sitting down with friends after work and having some sake and ramen at Jinya Bar. Midtown in case my non locals don't know is for people age 18 - 35 . typically any older and you are considered a boomer. LOL but in all honesty it is a great place to hang out with friends and meet new people and enjoy the nice dark relaxing tone of the restaurant and let the ramen please those tastebuds and dopamine.
