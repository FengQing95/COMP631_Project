Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There seems to be a divide in the reviews among the people who came for breakfast, and everything else later in the day. We were in the area one Sunday afternoon, and decided to swing by about an hour before closing. I was a little disappointed that there were no croissants left, but early bird gets the worm. So we made do and ordered a few yummy looking items to go: chocolate chip cookie, coffee eclair, and pear and pecan bread.
