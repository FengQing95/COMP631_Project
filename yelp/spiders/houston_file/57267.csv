Kata Robata////Wow. Way to turn yourselves around Kata Robata. They reached out after my s.o. wrote to them about our most recent experience and they really made sure to make it up to us. Long story short, we finally got omakase reservations and will DEFINITELY be back. Price point is about $150 too for great quality stuff. Thanks chef Hori and the Kata team!
