Uchi////Food & service was great!! We had a quiet small room for the seven of us right by the kitchen. The interior looked beautiful & it gave off a good atmosphere. We tried the Signature where there are 5 courses & also had some add ons. My favorites were definitely the raw items. We got the toro (which was amazing) & the Japanese uni (creamy).
