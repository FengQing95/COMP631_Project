JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really loved the spicy chicken ramen minus the chicken... Next time I will try the beef or pork because to me the chicken lacked flavor. But don't be discouraged to try it because the broth and ramen make up for it by a landslide! Make sure to add a seasoned egg to your ramen, absolutely delicious!
