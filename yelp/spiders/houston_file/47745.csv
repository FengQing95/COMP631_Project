Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the Benny duo with the Bella Bella and chilaquiles. Honestly best eggs Benedict I have had. I love the duo option to try two different ones because it gave a huge diversity of flavor with the spicy crunch and smoky pork of the chilaquiles and the prosciutto and cream cheese. To top it off, it came with a glorious hashbrown. Definitely will be coming back!
