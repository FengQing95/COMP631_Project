Uchi////The food was great, duh! My partner and I love Austin and the one in Austin is infamous among our Austin friends so I expected good food from the moment I walked in! I always get nigiri or sashimi...so sorry if you want to know about the other foods (except for the Brussel sprouts, OMG). The nigiri was very fresh the best I've found in Houston. I ordered all the regular ones and some they had on special. To be honest I wasn't impressed with the specials but it was probably because they coursed out every fish, which I loved, but I didn't pace my wine. My partner said he liked the basic ones as well. The uni was fabulous, as was the scallop. Now, I'm always nervous to order the clam..anywhere because most of the time it is too dry or just blah. It was nice. Clean bite into it right away and a great finish.
