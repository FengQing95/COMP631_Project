Uchi////Having read rave reviews of the brussel sprouts and fried milk, I was destined to order these the first time I went. And as soon as I took my first bite, I'm pretty sure I shat myself a little bit, because it was honestly the best brussel sprouts and dessert I've ever had in my life. Now I'm not sure what's exactly in the brussel sprouts, but from what I know, they're fried (sans batter) and tossed in a mixture of fish sauce and chili sauce. As for the fried milk, it almost tastes like they tickled a cow and then deep fried its sweet teat nectar and put it on a plate with crushed up corn flakes and a brick of chocolate ganache. A masterpiece so beautiful, I seasoned each bite with my tears.
