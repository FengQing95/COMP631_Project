Uchi////Boy, was I wrong. All I had to do was tell the waiter that I was vegetarian, and he immediately brought me a delicious veggie and avocado roll. I was pretty satisfied given that usually the "vegetarian option" at many restaurants is a boring plate of pasta or steamed vegetables, but it didn't end there. He continued to bring plate after plate of thoughtfully curated Japanese dishes, all of which were beautifully plated and flavorful.
