Uchi////I thought Uchi was pretty good. Most of their food was unique and not found in other Sushi places. If you are looking for Sashimi, I felt their price was substantially higher than most and possible not worth eating there. If you are into Chef's recommendation, rolls, etc. this is the place to go. Keep in mind I went there during Happy Hour, 5-6:30pm and their prices are 1/2 off. I would probably return during those times as I think that's a good value ratio for what you get.
