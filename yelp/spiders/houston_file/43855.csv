Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Chicken on a Biscuit: Get ready to wait...we waited over 20 minutes!  However, I really enjoyed the biscuit, but might be because I love carbs...and they give you a good, quality, chunk of chicken, like maybe half a chicken that is well fried with a crispy batter.  The only comment would be that it was a bit bland and would benefit from some pepper or salt.  Going back to inconsistency, the first time we got this, the cheese was missing, second time, it made an appearance!
