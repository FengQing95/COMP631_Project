Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This dog friendly patio was worth the wait! The modernized Jetson caf√© hit the spot perfectly. The waitress, meghan was attentive and friendly. They even had a doggy bowl for water. They told us the wait would be 30-45 minutes but we received our "your table is ready" text in less than that. While we were waiting, we enjoyed our free coffee and water while playing cornhole. The atmosphere fit right into the montrose theme; eccentric. I ordered the Juan's breakfast tacos with the alterations of add bacon and avocado and asked for no pico de Gallo. When it came, it had the avocado bacon, and pico de Gallo but it wasn't a big deal, I just picked It off. Everyone else was completely satisfied with their meals. All on the table we had the Snooze Spuds Deluxe with bacon and ranchero sauce, a Breakfast burrito with ranchero sauce, Juan's breakfast tacos with bacon and avocado, the Huevos Ranchero, and the Breakfast Pot Pie, as well as a pancake flight with a pineapple upside down, sweet potato, and blueberry bam (pancake of the day). The only complaint I have is, why do I have to pay $4 for a coffee at the table when it's completely free and unlimited while waiting...?
