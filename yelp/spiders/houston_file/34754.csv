Local Foods////I don't eat out much because I'm a pretty good cook and like to eat light, and I find restaurants too heavy. This is one of the ONLY restaurants I eat out because the salads are awesome and the sandwiches too. I always get the garden Sammie because it would take forever to prepare all the vegetables that they pack into the sandwich. I'd have to make hummus, fry Brussels sprouts, cook cauliflower, mash avocado, sprouts, tomatoes, pickle onions etc. I take a friend and split the meal! I've had the other sandwiches too but this is my fave. I'd thought about getting a job there because I have tried countless times to replicate their salads but I don't even come close.
