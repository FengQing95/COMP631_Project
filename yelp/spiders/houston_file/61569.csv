Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs (spinach, artichoke, & jack cheese) plate. Honestly, I was afraid at first, but HONEY, it was great! I am NOT a spinach person, but I ate every bit of eggs on my plate. It is was THAT good. As for the rest of the meal, the chicken apple sausage & potatoes weren't bad. For both, I'd say taste was slightly over average.
