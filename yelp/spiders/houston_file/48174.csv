Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Still great food. The service was slow and we had about a 15 min wait to be seated. They forgot to put in one item we ordered and took a long time to correct the mistake. They comped that part of the order, which was some consolation. Our server seemed to be just strolling around at a very busy time. I don't believe they are all like this, but I hope others don't have the same experience.
