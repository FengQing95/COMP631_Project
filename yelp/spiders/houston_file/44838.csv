Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Up to this point this place has over 700 reviews and I know my review is really unnecessary but I feel compelled to say something. This bakery is all that and some!! I love how the layout is well put together and how the pastries are displayed. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and line wasn't too bad (maybe the rush was over) but there was a constant flow of customers coming in. I didn't order anything but while my kids made their macaron choices the aroma of fresh coffee filled the air and captivated me for a moment. Gosh, I love that smell!!
