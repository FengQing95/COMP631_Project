Baby Barnaby's////Oh my goodness...we happened upon this place by accident. It was pouring raining, and it had a nice convenient parking lot right next door. As we entered drenched, we were greeted by Scott, a ray of hysterical sunshine. The food was outstanding. We had the waffle, bacon, and breakfast burrito with potatoes. Everything was spot on. Scott truly made our dining experience fun. I laughed almost the entire meal. Five stars all the way. Thank you for a delicious breakfast and a great start to our day. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Houston.
