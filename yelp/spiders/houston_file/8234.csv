JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I can't believe I have never posted about my favorite ramen spot inside the loop!  It's definitely our go-to ramen place.  I've discovered in my eating ramen in a restaurant journey that I'm not a big fan of the typical Tonkatsu Black style.  I like my ramen like it comes in the package, hot and spicy.  So on my discovery to one of my favorite comfort foods, Jinya has been there to help me figure it out.  They will typically have some kind of special or just the Tonkatsu Spicy that's on the regular menu.  Getting closer!  We also love their Quinoa salad, so good.  Definitely try this one if you haven't.  If you don't mind driving, Tiger Den is our other favorite, really great apps as well.
