Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I read all the reviews about the place being "worth" long waits, "worth" the bad parking, and "worth" total lack of wait space. No, no it is not. After no parking being available nearby, I parked in a spot I worried about being towed or booted, walked in the cold rain for a block or so, and then was "sardined" into a very tiny waiting area. I stood uncomfortably for 48 minutes after being told by the hostess (who was constantly snacking), that the wait should be around 25-30 minutes.
