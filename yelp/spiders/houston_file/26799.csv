The Pit Room////Alright, there is no need to drive for hours when craving some amazing bbq anymore. I believe I have never tried a brisket so moist yet, and that's not talking about flavors. Whatever combination and technique is being used by the pit master for his creations are definitely working. Although the brisket was excellent, my favorite was the beef rib. The beef rib, a massive rib, that was the winner for me. The meeting was not only moist and full of flavor, you could pinch it out of the bone with your bare fingers, well I did, and it tasted like heaven. Honestly, I think you don't even need bbq sauce at all. But of course, that's crazy talking. I also tried the jalape√±o and cheddar sausage, and it was outstanding, made daily at location. Overall the experience was amazing, and of course, a very friendly staff makes it better. I was not that thrilled about the sides, we had beans and cole slaw, but with such an amazing bbq, I did not want to fill up with the sides. Way to go Pit Room BBQ!
