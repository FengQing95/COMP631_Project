Uchi////Quite possibly one of the best restaurants in Houston. Make sure to make a reservation in advance or sit at the bar. There is always a line right before it opens so make sure to get there early. Uchi has an amazing (and affordable) happy hour. This place is great for ordering a bunch of plates and sharing. Dont forget to try the specialty sides like brussel sprouts
