Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you don't mind the wait, or get lucky and come when there isn't one, then the food is very good. However I can't say the food is good enough to negate the wait, so it ends up with 3 stars from me. I would definitely come back again if I could get in, but I would not put up with sitting around for an hour or more just to eat here.
