The Pit Room////This is one of those rare places that really lives up to the reviews. I've heard good things and have been wanting to try it for a while now and boy howdy, I left stuffed and satisfied. My eyes Â said to get a 3-meat combo but I decided on only two (pork ribs and brisket). Good thing too since I couldn't even quite finish the last bite of the 2-meat dinner. Lots of delicious food for about $15. Both the ribs and brisket were excellent. Thanks to the other people at my table I also got to try the venison sausage and pulled pork, both good, but I'd say try the sausage if you have to pick between them. For my two sides I went with mac and cheese and the beans, both delicious. Even the sliced pickles were some of the best I've had at a BBQ place. I'm just looking forward to when I get to go back and I hope this place continues to live up to sky high expectations its set for itself.
