The Pit Room////This place is really cool. A bbq joint attached to an outdoor bar! They were out of brisket, and ribs but the turkey and pulled pork were good. I got there 30 minutes before the bbq side closed so if they weren't out of anything I would have been concerned. Overall it was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of their coffee bbq sauce. The okra and charro beans were good. The potato was almost Karen's potato salad if you know what I mean.
