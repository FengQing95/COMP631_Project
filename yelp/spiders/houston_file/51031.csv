Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Strike #3: Our server never checked in on us, or even asked us how the food was once we received it. No water refills, nothing. She didn't even drop off our food. She literally came to our table twice, once to take our order, and the second time to drop off the check after we had to wave her down. I told her that my dish was cold and that I never got my hash brown. I did not want a comped dish, I just wanted to let her know how sh*tty the food was. She responded with OMG YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME, NOW I FEEL BAD. Yes, I would have told you if you did your job and checked on us. Note to self, do not come towards closing time, because all the servers are practically done for the day. They're all standing around the service area "doing their side work", laughing out loud, and joking around. Explains the lack of service. Oh and here's the kicker. When we asked for a bag for our two boxes, my server told me we can get a bag at the front... So unreal, it's almost comical.
