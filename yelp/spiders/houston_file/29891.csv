The Pit Room////This place was pretty dope. I mean dope as in pretty cool, pretty yummy-smelly and also laid back. Which is really nice, because when it is hot as hell out, and everyone is sweating.... like the meat they they are cooking!! (Buh-dum tiss) But we ordered like a family deal since there was 6 adults and 2 kids and a baby. (I should say two babies because my partner is such a baby but we can count them as an adult.)
