JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious!  My favorite ramen is the wanton chicken, to which I add cabbage.  I also love the Brussels sprouts.  I find somethings the seating feels a little crowded.  There is a large table in the center for community style seating - so if you are not into that and it's busy, you may have to wait.  The restaurant is a bit loud, but for a lunch spot, it works for me.  Service is good, food is served quickly.
