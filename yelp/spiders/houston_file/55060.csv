Kata Robata////The food was delicious and inventive and TINY PORTIONS.  TINY!!!  Like, bitty me who has a hard time finishing anything left here wondering if I should go somewhere else for more food.  I went for the Black Cod, and it was sooooo good.  I was upset that I had only figured out about the sauce on the plate toward the end of the meal.  (To be fair, it was a similar color as the plate, and lumped inconspicuously the size of a nickel.)
