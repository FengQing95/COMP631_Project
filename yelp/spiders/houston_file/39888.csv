Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried Bosscat for the first time last night, and it was amazing. I needed a new hangout, and this will be it. Jen was our server and she was awesome! She was very attentive. When she found out it was our first time there she suggested we visit the Whiskey Room which was definitely a treat. She was very efficient while juggling multiple tables inside and out. Can't wait to go back.
