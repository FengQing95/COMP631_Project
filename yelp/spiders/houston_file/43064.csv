Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First off, the pastries are amazing. The cup of hot tea was perfectly brewed. And that's the extent of my good experience with Common Bond. I was in today (around 2:45) and while there wasn't a line, the place was packed. I was immediately greeted by a young man who never smiled. I told him it was my first time and wasn't familiar with some of the pastries. He just stared at me, no response. I asked him what one of the pastries was and he literally just told me the name of it (they each have a sign so I knew the name). When I asked him what was in it, he gave a very well reheated answer. Mind you, he never looked at me once. I was a bother to him. I ordered. The cashier smiled and was polite. The gentleman who handed me my pastry smiled and was very warm. But everyone else had a sour look and every time I smiled at them they would stare at me. Is the management horrible and they're miserable? Are they tired from the crowds? I work long hours in retail so expect some basic customer service, especially from a place tho popular.
