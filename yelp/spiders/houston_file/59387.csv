Baby Barnaby's////When I was driving up to the location, I was a bit worried about where to park because of the narrow roads leading to the restaurant. I have to say they have veryy tight parking spots! Please improve the parking. There are actually two restaurants here: Barnaby Cafe and "Baby" Barnaby Cafe (which is the breakfast place). The location was very cozy and the place was packed for a mid-morning breakfast. I ordered the banana-nut pancake and my friend got the huevos rancheros. I have to say the pancake was colossal! It came with a cute mug for the syrup and I really enjoyed the pancake. The eggs platter was pretty average, except the crunchy potatoes (mmm). Service was okay, nothing too special.
