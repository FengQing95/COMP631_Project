The Pit Room////I don't understand the appeal of this joint. The food is mediocre at best so it doesn't justify the premium pricing. I got the 2 meat plate - chicken and brisket. Neither were as good as Rudy's. Properly smoked dark meat chicken should be falling apart but this did not. The brisket, though moist, is very chewy. One and done for sure.
