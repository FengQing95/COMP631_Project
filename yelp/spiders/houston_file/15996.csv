JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I absolutely love Jinya. An awesome ramen place that really hits the spot especially for being a chain. We came on a very cold day, so the wait was 30 min. Not a problem, except when they seated us, the table that we were going to take up was still occupied by people. We awkwardly waited a bit for the waitress to take us back to the crowded front. Other than this, the service was good and my water cup was always filled. For appetizers, we got the shrimp tempura that was coated in a creamy sauce (delicious) and the crispy chicken bites (super hot right when you get it. So watch out!). I preferred the shrimp since it tasted more flavorful! But both are good! The ramen type I always get is the tonkotsu black. VERY flavorful and with the seasoned egg it truly hits the spot any day! Definitely give this place a try if you've never had ramen and want to!
