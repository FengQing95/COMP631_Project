Kata Robata////Also, I asked our waiter for any recommendations and his answer was "whatever you want to eat". The menu here is EXTENSIVE, guys. There is absolutely no freaking way they can possibly make every item on the menu perfect, therefore, there are obviously some dishes that are better than others. Thanks for the help mate, you really helped me narrow down my choices. He did keep my water glass full for the most part...ish.
