The Pit Room////The menu is pretty simple, which I appreciate! Luckily, a friend agreed to go halfsies with me on a 3 meat  dinner which came with two sides of our choice. So, I got the chance to try quite a few tasty samples! This 3 meat entrée with sides is $17.75, but it's A LOT of food. Sharing it between two people, we didn't finish it all! Great portion sizes for the price point!
