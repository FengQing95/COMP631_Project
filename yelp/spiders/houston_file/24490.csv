Uchi////We made reservations for 5:45 PM because social hour (happy hour) goes until 6:30 PM and is a good deal.  Eric R. and I had Sapporo on happy hour special, plus he got a hot sake, and my mom got a glass of prosecco.  From the happy hour menu, we ordered all four makimono (avomaki, spicy tuna crunch, negi hama, and sake) plus the sake crudo (twice), the short rib, the nasu nigiri, and the gyutan (wagyu beef tongue) nigiri.  From the regular menu we got brussel sprouts, grilled edamame, hama chili, hotate nigiri, hamachi nigiri, shime saba nigiri for me, and Eric R. got ikura.  From the daily specials, we got bluefin otoro nigiri, my mom ordered baby yellowtail, and I got uni gunkan.
