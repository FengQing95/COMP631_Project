JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Awesome Japanese Ramen!! After living in Japan for 2 years I came back to the US with a hunger for great ramen. It's been hard to find a place that was true to Japanese flavors and not wanting to compromise. Well I don't have to look any further because this is it. The flavors were awesome and the price was right. I had the Sprouting Up Ramen and the Jinya Bun and it was like I was right back in the middle of Tokyo.
