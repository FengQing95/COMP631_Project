Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Okay so this place is delicious. It was recommended by my sister who currently lives in Houston. From the flaky croissants to the savory dishes. I was in awe of the flavors in the flatbreads and the salad.. but I feel my favorite dish was the shrimp and grits and the red velvet croissant. Not too sweet... Just the perfect flavor. If your in the area definitely check this place out. My husband also chose to get a slice of there hot fresh baked bread and oh was it delicious . We added some of the goat cheese from the salad and it hit the spot.. for any bread lovers, I absolutely recommend it if your getting a salad.
