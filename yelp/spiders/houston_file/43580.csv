Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been multiple times for breakfast and brunch and I've loved nearly everything I've tried. Bread is the star, so definitely order a sandwich of some kind. I loved the falafel when it was on the menu, and more recently enjoyed a side of brussels sprouts with pork belly. I've only ordered a latte there once and it was fine - nothing great or wrong with it. I sat at the coffee bar seating and received a small sample of excess hot chocolate though, and it was amazing - possible perk to sitting there?
