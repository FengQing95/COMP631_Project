Kata Robata////My friend definitely succeeded in showing me amazing fresh sushi in Houston. We came here early and had a drink at the small bar area prior to getting seated in the dining room. We ordered many items to try a variety, and all were excellent and of great quality. Our service was fairly quick and attentive as well.
