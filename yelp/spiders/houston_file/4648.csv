JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Although you will likely wait 30+ minutes for a table, JINYA is by far the best ramen spot in Houston. Personal recommendation is the Tonkotsu Black. I've dabbled around the entire menu, and have been satisfied with everything I've tried, but I always come back to the Tonkotsu Black as my favorite dish.
