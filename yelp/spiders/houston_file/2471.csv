JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////(As per the response of the general manager below you can verify the attitude and lack of class their staff has, of course there would be a public denial of them seating their friends before other people). I wonder why all the other people waiting after us left... maybe, just maybe they noticed this also. I just wish I had taken a photo of that list to show how they scratched and wrote us back. Btw our party was all there and we were waiting with 2 little children, which of course they don't care). Don't worry GM I don't have the need to EVER come back. You just burned yourself (if possible) even more and publicly, great job! Keep attending your "hundreds" of customers, that won't come back after they meet you. I was not going to bother, but after reading all your lies I had to, so now my nasty review is again on top of the list. Thanks to YOU! Sorry, not sorry.
