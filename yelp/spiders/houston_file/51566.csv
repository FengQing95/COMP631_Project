Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yaaasss!! From the service, to the cute space and to the food, everything was great. I loved walking in and seeing the bright colors and being seated at their cool round booths (it was a bit tough getting people inside and all, but it was nice bc I got to lock my kids in!)
