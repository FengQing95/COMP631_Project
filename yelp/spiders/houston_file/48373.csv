Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////RESERVATIONS: They don't take reservations, however, you can show up and put your name/phone # in. They'll text you when your table's ready. We figured out the good idea of driving there around 9AM, putting our name in, coming back home (we live close) until they text us our table's ready. If this isn't an option, they have some tables and games (yay for cornhole/bags and Connect 4!) to keep you busy. They also have a "bar" you can order some mimosas or bloodies or whatever you may fancy while you wait.
