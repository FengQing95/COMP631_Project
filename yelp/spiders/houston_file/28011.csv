The Pit Room////Stopped here after getting back into the states from vacation (about 25 min from Bush Airport) and it was a great decision I must say. Super friendly staff, clean, and most importantly, delicious. Had pork ribs and brisket, mac, queso (hey I just got off a 16 hour plane ride, judgement free here kids). My wife also has some elotes which she said was great. Will definitely go back when in Houston.
