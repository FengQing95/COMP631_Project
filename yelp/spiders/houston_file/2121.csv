JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Best place in Houston for Ramen so far.  I've only picked up... (I had a cold) but am looking forward to dining there asap, if I can get in. I placed my order as soon as they opened at 11:00am on Sunday and was there by 11:15.  All the tables were already full!  Its. that. good.
