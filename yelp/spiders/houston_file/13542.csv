JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The chicken was moist on the inside, but the batter did not give the chicken a very crispy skin. The ponzu sauce added some acidity, which was needed because the chicken was bland, but what I liked most was the garlic pepper. If I could've coated the chicken with just the garlic pepper it would've been perfect.
