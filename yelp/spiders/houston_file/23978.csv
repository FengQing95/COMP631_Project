Uchi////I personally did not know what I wanted, so one Omakase was music to my ears: a 6 course Signature Tasting with simply amazing dishes (hot and cold + dessert!) served back to back. My favorite item was the hama chili! It was the most brilliant combination of citrus and fish I have ever tasted. We also added on the Gyutoro short rib that's prepared for 72 hours...my mouth is watering just typing about it!
