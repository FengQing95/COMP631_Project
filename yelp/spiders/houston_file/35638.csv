Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great vibe/atmosphere and crowed. Service excellent, I sat at the bar, had great beer selection. I got the BossCat press, a Texas version of a Cuban sandwich. Which in my opinion is what a Cuban sandwich should be! Theirs is a delicious pulled pork, ham, pickle, cheese and mustard pressed sandwich, far better than what I get in Miami (where I live) where they basically serve a ham sandwich with pickles dry as hell and bland. Also the Latin bartender provide great scenery Â so sexy, love the tats and arms! And all " the rest", censoring details in case my mom reads this review.
