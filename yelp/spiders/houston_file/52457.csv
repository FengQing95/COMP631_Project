Kata Robata////Our waiter, Thai, was awesome. His knowledge of the food (to include gluten-free options and substitutes) was extensive! We showed up on a Saturday night without reservations so we had to wait for 20 or 30 minutes to be seated. The bar tender, Justin, was also great. Â Loved the food, especially the Yuzu sauce that came on the Hamachi and jalapeno sashimi.
