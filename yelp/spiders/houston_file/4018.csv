JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is very clean very hip looking. Its great if this is your type of scene. Its a lot of energy in the atmosphere and very good food. Great vibes. I did not like how loud it was and the serving is much smaller than i expected but i suppose I am just used to the traditional huge American style "serving" sizes. The prices are very good though and not at all bad if you are on a budget. It is in a great location down town and the staff was polite. The food was delicious but I think I would have enjoyed it more the second time around so I know what to expect and what dishes go well together.
