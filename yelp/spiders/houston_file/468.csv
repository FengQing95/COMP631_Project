JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ehren - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your kind words, and regret that our servers have consistently made errors during your visits. It is unacceptable, and I would invite you to ask for any of my managers (Keith, Kathy or Raul) who will make sure your stay with us is copacetic. I won't make excuses, but please know we try to do our best for each and every customer. Thank you for your consideration and understanding.
