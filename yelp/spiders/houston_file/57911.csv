Kata Robata////The rolls I ordered for curbside were less than fresh. See pics. I also parked in the curbside pickup and sat there for 10 minutes thinking my order wasn't ready (the curbside pickup clearly states to wait for your order to be brought out). I finally decided to go in and find 3 hostesses standing there chatting and my order had probably been sitting on the table the whole time. Had I known or been instructed to come in I could've saved that time.
