Uchi////Being here twice now, there were some notable dishes the first time around that Â had to be reordered. In particular, the "walu walu" is an unforgettable dish. I have been a fan of escolar since the first time I had it (it is the closest thing to Tora for me, if that is not avaiable on a sushi menu). The "walu walu" is escolar valhalla. Comprising of oak grilled escolar, candied citrus, yuzupon (a combination of ponzu and the yuzu fruit), and myoga (which is a edible flower like herb - also known as japanese ginger), it is, as I said before, unforgettable...There were several people who I was at dinner with were spooning up the broth well after the escolar was eaten.
