Kata Robata////The food was pretty awesome. My most favorites were foie gras + scallop and hot stone abalone and uni. Foie Gras + Scallop is basically seared scallop topped with foie gras. Absolutely delicious! Hot stone abalone Â and uni is like sushi rice mixture in hot stone with abalone, spinach, uni, etc. Great combination. It's like a fancy version of bibimbap. I also like the Foie Gras and Duck Chawanmushi a lot too. It is pretty rich so it would be better to share an order with 2-3 people. Foie Gras, duck breast, oyster mushroom, egg custard all come together. I like how duck breast was perfectly processed and with no fat. Egg custard and foie gras go well together. And of course, the addition of mushroom brings everything to perfection.
