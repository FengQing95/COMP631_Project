Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I got the French dip Sandwhich and it was dry, it had a very weird smell to the meat. When trying to sit at a table the employee stopped us from sitting and there were customers fighting over tables. While the employees job is to calm the customers she walked off and was very unprofessional.
