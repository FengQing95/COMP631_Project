JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got the Cha Cha Cha and the sprouting up ramen. The pork belly was melt in your mouth DE LIC IOUS. The broth was very tasty, it is not overwhelmed by a super salty taste. You know how some ramen places have super salty broth, this place hits the nail on the head. I am not a huge fan of bamboo shoots but when I found them in my bowl, I decided to give them a try and to my surprise, they were DAMN GOOOOD. This place is definitely not suited for Instagram photos of your food. Remember to bring in a flashlight to take high quality photos. -Quang
