Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Would've gave this place 5 stars but if you're anything like me, you look for 3-4 star for honest opinions. I've been to Bosscat about 5 times now, each time I've tried something different and I have yet to come across a dish I didn't like. The service is the best thing about the place. Bar tenders are super friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their grand selection of whiskey (best in the city)
