Kata Robata////Really enjoyed my meal at Kata Robata. We ordered the chicken skewers, spicy soy ramen and A special spicy sushi roll (forgot the name). Service was prompt and kind. I am usually not a ramen fan however I would come back to Kata Robata for ramen. It was the perfect balance between a heavy and light broth. I believe this was due to the fresh toppings they included to help balance the fatty/heavy side to this dish. The sushi was very fresh and the cut of fish was perfectly balanced to give the right texture. The chicken skewers were juicy very flavorful!
