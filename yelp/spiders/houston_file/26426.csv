The Pit Room////My husband and I decided to split the Three Meat Dinner ($17) thinking that it was going to be a ton of food. In actuality, it wasn't a whole lot, but enough to satisfy us both. Unfortunately, you cannot choose beef ribs as part of the dinner combos. It is only available a la carte at $22 a lb. And also unfortunately, the wait for the jalapeno cheddar pork sausage would be 15 mins, so we passed. For our three meat dinner, we chose: black pepper garlic venison sausage (1x whole sausage sliced), brisket and pork ribs (2x). The brisket was super moist and fatty. Maybe a bit more fatty than I would have liked. But nonetheless, it was really tender and really good. Probably my favorite among all three meats! The venison sausage was lean and flavorful, not exactly my cup of tea, but my husband loved it. And the pork ribs were nicely seasoned. Not as meaty as I thought it would be, but maybe it was the way it was portioned/sliced?
