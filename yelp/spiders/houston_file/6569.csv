JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I attempted to make eye contact with our waiter several times as he walked back and forth to tables and to the front of the restaurant and have never felt so completely ignored. He never introduced himself so we didn't know how to address him but after attempting to get his attention for approx 15 minutes, we finally spoke up "excuse me" while tapping him as he walked by. I thought "he's been ignoring us so intentionally maybe he's not our waiter!" We asked for our check. He said ok and continued to walk back and forth by us without making eye contact for approx 20 minutes!!! I swear if it had been one minute more I was going to ask to speak to a manager (i am very passive with strangers, very non confrontational) but this was absurd! I've worked in customer service a lot and I swear I am the Queen of giving the benefit of the doubt but for goodness sake when you see me raising my hand and staring at you to catch some eye contact- look at me and acknowledge my existence please. Even if you are swamped (he was not) you take a moment to look and say with your eyes "I see you and you're next."
