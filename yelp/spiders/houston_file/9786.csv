JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I did not see your reply sooner and I appreciatey it. What I was trying to show you at that night is in the middle of that thin ramen I can see the hard uncooked gray part, that is why I keep on telling you it's raw (so wrong wording, uncooked then huh ). I can feel it when I eat it.
