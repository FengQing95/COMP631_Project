The Pit Room////Let's start off with the sides. The only reason why I even ordered the charro beans is because everyone on Yelp was raving about it. So, I wanted to see what all the hoopla was all about. I will have to agree with everyone. The charro beans was off the chain. Probably better than any Mexican restaurant I've ever had them. And the mac n cheese was nice and cheesy. It would be even better if they perhaps threw some panko or breadcrumbs on top. I would definitely order these two sides again.
