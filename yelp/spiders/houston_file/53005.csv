Kata Robata////Uni and King Crab Spoons - an amazing combination...creamy uni, sweet succulent crabmeat, salty bursts of tobiko, all covered in a refreshing soy-vinegar sauce. It had the makings of the 'perfect bite'...if only the uni had been fresher. However, since there wasn't that much uni on the spoon, the fishiness was very subtle and the whole thing was still delectable. I only notice because I'm an avid uni enthusiast.
