The Pit Room////Whenever I'm home, this is the place I go to. It stands out, and the smoked meats here are extremely good. I love getting the brisket the most. Everything has a unique taste to it that I've yet to find at any other BBQ type place. The people who work here are always very friendly, and I really love the sauce. If I could give them 10 stars, I would!
