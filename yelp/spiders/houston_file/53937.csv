Kata Robata////Not impressed.  There are way too many sushi places in Houston to tolerate the lousy service we received.  We were there for my daughter's 24th birthday and she loves sushi, we were ignored, rushed and dismissed and we certainly were not impressed with the food.  As a matter of fact we left there still hungry and went somewhere else.
