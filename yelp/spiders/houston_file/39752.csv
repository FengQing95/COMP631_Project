Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bottom Line - Â I didn't try any of the drinks, but if you're looking for a bar with an eclectic group of people then this is the place for you. The drink menu did look intriguing, but a little pricey. If you want a good meal and be able to talk with your friends or your date, you're better off going elsewhere.
