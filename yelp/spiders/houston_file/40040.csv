Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I cannot remember the last time I sat down at a restaurant and enjoyed EVERYTHING! The food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the service was amazing! Terry is the most amazing server that was patient and talked to me about all of the appetizers and entrees I asked about! I opted to try some of his favorites and what do you know, he did not disappoint!! I am sitting outside enjoying the weather (I know, when can you say that is Houston?!?) and the awesome music they are playing.
