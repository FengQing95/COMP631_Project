The Pit Room////Food/Price $: I ordered the 2 meat plate which came with 2 sides, and a piece of bread and it costed about $16 (with tax). I got the brisket and it was very tender and the rub was really good. I also got the pork ribs which was the complete opposite. It wasn't tender at all; in fact it was pretty tough and they cut you pretty big pieces which can be a challenge to eat.
