Kata Robata////Went to eat lunch around 1:30 pm on Sunday afternoon with my two kids and wife. As we entered, the hostess (who looked very bored) greeted us unenthusiastically with no smile. We wanted a booth and she took us to the one by the bathroom even though there are booths very close to entrance and empty. So when we asked her about those, she reluctantly sat us down and it seemed we made her mad. I already started to have a bad feeling. Well, we waited for 15 minutes and no one comes to get our order even though the restaurant seemed almost empty. Another family was eating at the booth in front of us and their waiter saw us sitting in the same area but never came by to see if we were waited on or not. Â So I finally went to hostess and asked to speak with manager. The manager apologized and promised to take care of it. He came by to our table and apologized again and offered free dessert for the inconvenience. So ironically same waiter comes and takes our order. We ordered a few items from happy hour menu and about another 20 minutes later we got our food. When I looked at the bill, i saw regular price was charged for a happy hour item. Overall, food was good but service was just horrible. It amazes me that how some good restaurants do not take the impact of customer service seriously. We probably will never go there again because bad experience always lingers behind your mind.
