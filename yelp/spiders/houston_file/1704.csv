JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I wouldn't call myself a ramen expert or a ramen snob...but I can tell you that the food here is quite tasty. The hot tonkotsu spicy ramen has just the right amount of spice. I always add a seasoned egg to make it that much more savory. Start with the blistered shishito peppers and/or seaweed salad and you'll walk away more than satisfied.
