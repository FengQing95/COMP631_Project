Uchi////We ordered about 10 rolls from maki to nigiri. The sushi was standard and overpriced. Nigiri came as one piece instead of the standard two at other sushi places and twice as much. The rolls were your standard Americanized spicy tunas and California rolls. An honorable mention was the duck which came steamed in a little pot but each person was slated for one small piece for a whopping $30.
