Kata Robata////We attempted to order lunch and they were out of both the miso crusted bone marrow and toro... But it was only Tuesday? I docked a star for that. You would think that some of their most popular dishes would be stocked adequately especially at the beginning of the week. It was a bit discouraging when I kept being told what I wanted was out of stock. Luckily halfway through our meal they restocked the toro. The sushi was fresh and flavorful. The amaebi was my favorite since it has such a unique texture and flavor. It also comes with the fried shrimp head which was a nice touch. The yakiniku rice bowl was also incredibly flavorful. The beef was tender and juicy and the sweet garlic sauce was amazing.
