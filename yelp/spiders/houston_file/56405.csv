Kata Robata////Loved this place and the ambiance. I went for happy hour with my friends and we had a great time, good food and amazing drinks prepared by Tuan. We sat at the bar and Tuan took care of us. The food came out quick and service was on point. Tuan did a great job and prepares good drinks. The place gets really pack so I will recommend to her there early for happy hour. I will definitely go back!!!
