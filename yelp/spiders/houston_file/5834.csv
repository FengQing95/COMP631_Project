JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Some days you crave something so delicious you can't get your thoughts on it until you find it on google. I've been craving ramen for a couple days now so what better way to satisfy it by coming to Jinya! Love the ramen and the variety. I love the spicy chicken ramen and chicken chashu bowl. I definitely loved the moist soft mushrooms and the boiled egg in the soup. We did order some spicy shrimp tempura and fried chicken which was awesome. My son ordered he kids meal which comes with soooo much food. He got soup, chicken and rice, fries, orange slice, candy and ice cream. The green tea is delicious, service was awesome. Our waiter was super cool and kept checking on us making sure we were good. He even had to run out to his car real quick but he kept us informed and our food still arrived at a timely manner. Food and service was awesome does look like they have removed items from their menu because the menu was different. I wish they had fried calamari but they didn't that was the only downfall for me. Our waiters name was hamza and he was super cool and very nice to us during our visit! If your in search for awesome ramen check this spot out!
