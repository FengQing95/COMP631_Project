Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am not afraid to label Common Bond as my favorite food spot in Houston. Every element of the establishment is thoughtfully composed and presented to every person who walks through. I have tried a good portion of the pastries and baked goods, and I am also quite familiar with the brunch menu, and I have yet to consume anything that was less than great.
