Local Foods////The portions are large for what you pay, so if you think that it's expensive, try eating anywhere else in town and getting portions this large for this high of quality ingredients and see how much more you end up paying. I am a huge fan of this high quality ingredients restaurant after only two visits and plan to be back again and again.
