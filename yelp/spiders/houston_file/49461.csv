Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Family of 4, great environment, appropriate for children.  Wait time wasn't too long. About 10 minutes.  I ordered the benny duo and picked the chilaquiles with barbacoa and Ham Benedict III. I would probably just order Ham Benedict III next time, but only because I love the classic hollandaise sauce. We ordered OMG French Toast as well. Talk about flavor. We treated it as an appetizer so everybody got a bite. :)
