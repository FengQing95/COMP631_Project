Uchi////Tonight was different and I understand that changes will need to be made due to the pandemic. I mostly miss being able to eat at the bar... There's always something special about being able to see what goes on behind the bar, and anyone else that knows their way around their kitchen can easily appreciate such things--even in silence.
