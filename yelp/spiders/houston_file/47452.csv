Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My goodness! One of the best Brunch/Breakfast places to go! Has vegetarian options which is nice to see! The omelettes and French toast are to die for! Great price point for good quality food and you always feel like your waiter/waitress is your best friend. Sefura (waitress) was the best!
