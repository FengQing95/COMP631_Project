Uchi////I can't begin to describe how wonderful everything was & the interesting use of ingredients. The yokai berry was my favorite due to the fattiness of the salmon, saltiness of the kale, which is then cut through with the freshness of the pear & green tea oil. Absolutely in love with the use of green tea oil. I cannot get over this dish, it was beautiful.
