Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was average. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, some hit and miss. Poutine was good, bacon candy was much overcooked, hush puppies were good, and the spicy dip was not great. Entrees were not great. I got the brick chicken and it was not tasty; I left half the plate. Similarly, I noticed pretty much no one finished their food and didn't get Togo boxes.. Â yikes.
