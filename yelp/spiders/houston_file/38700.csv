Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The hostess and servers were all very pleasant. We were seated near the back at a half table/half booth. I'm not sure if it is only on Father's Day or for every brunch, but when we went only the brunch menu was being served. Not an issue though because it had a good variety of options. I started with the breakfast in bed shot (maple whiskey, half slice of bacon, shot of orange juice) and peach sangria and ordered the sticky bun burger for my meal. My friend went with a classic mimosa, coffee, and chicken fried steak.
