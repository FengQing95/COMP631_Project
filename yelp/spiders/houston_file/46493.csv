Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The food is good, however they usually play music extremely loud! Sometimes they have been nice and reduced it so I can get school or work done without so much distraction. However I came in once and asked twice, saw them asking what I'm assuming is a manager and it never got lowered. It was so loud people were yelling and couldn't hear each other. I was even using my head phones and it didn't help! Think it's pretty rude that he couldn't lower it a bit!
