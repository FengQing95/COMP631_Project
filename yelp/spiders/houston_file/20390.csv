Uchi////Tips: Make a reservation when you can -- a wait for 2 people can get as long as 1.5 hours, but I promise you it's worth it if you can just hold off a little. Also, sit at the sushi bar when you get the opportunity. The service is amazing, and you get your own little "entertainment" with the chefs. Last time a friend and I went, we got carried away in a fun convo with the chefs (ask for Huy - he's hilarious!), and at the end of our dinner, they treated us to a dessert on the house. So sweet!!
