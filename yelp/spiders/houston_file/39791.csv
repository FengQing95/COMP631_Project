Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here today for the first time and the wait for brunch was over an hour! I was kinda ready to go home but we were finally called in and the hostess was very nice and apologetic for the wait. All those bad feelings went out the window when we finally got to try our food because it was SO good. We got short rib chilaquiles, fruity pebbles french toast, and totchos to share (2 adults & a toddler). The chilaquiles were so good! It's rare to get chilaquiles that don't get mushy or soggy but the ones here were perfect. They added a LOT of short rib and the tortilla strips stayed crunchy it was 10/10. I was scared that the french toast would be too sweet but it was perfect! They use sweetened condensed milk which was great to dip the toast in and it had lots of fruit, bacon, and cereal bits, 10/10. The totchos weren't anything crazy but they were still good and the chorizo was a very good addition, 8/10. Our waiter was also very nice and our drinks were never empty.
