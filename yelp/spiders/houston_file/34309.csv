Local Foods////I really enjoyed my salad from Local Foods! The only complaint I really have was that the shrimp had a much fishier scent than normal. I'm not sure why that was, but it didn't feel like it was the freshest. I have pretty high standards for seafood though. On the whole though, I really enjoyed the mix of my salad. It was filling and I felt like my body was happy I was treating it well with good food.
