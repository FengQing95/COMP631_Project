Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Always crowded. That, we can manage if we get early. BUT, bad service, bad faces, bad mood on top of a long wait, is NOT acceptable. We have been there a few times with different friend (why do we keeps saying yes to our friend that invite us there?). There are so many great places in the area. Don't waste your time coming to this one.
