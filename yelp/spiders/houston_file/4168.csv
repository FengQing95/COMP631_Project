JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not a HUGE fan of the style of seating Bc although it looks great and matches the type of food, Americans don't have the same manners as Asians apparently because the person across from us stared at us eat and was definitely listening to our conversation. The Ramen was delish, but one could easily eat more than one serving! Maybe or this, but to go.
