Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My girlfriend and I went there for our first time on a Thursday night. The place was bustling. It's a large place with indoor seating as well as outdoor. They have a large open bar in the center with ample seating, half booths around the wall in addition to tables throughout the interior.
