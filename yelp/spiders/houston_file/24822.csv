Uchi////No doubt one of the best sushi spots in Houston, on equal standings with MF Sushi, definitely ranked above Roka Akor. Every piece of sushi we had and every dish we ordered was a work of art and of superb quality (by Houston standards). All the raw items tasted quite fresh, without much of that strong fishy odor, yet still not comparable with the casual sushi restaurants in Japan.
