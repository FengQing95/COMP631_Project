Local Foods////Wow, where to begin? EVERYTHING IS AWESOME (cue Lego Movie music). My favorite items on the (sandwich) menu is the Truffled Egg Salad sandwich; it's what I get almost every time. I have also tried the Falafel on wheat, which I did enjoy, and the Market Veggie sandwich, which I did not like as much, unfortunately. Sometimes, instead of ordering a sandwich, I'll get the Vegan Chili soup (you should definitely try it if you haven't!) and a few sides. My favorite sides are the kale, barley, and coleslow. They used to have couscous which I liked a lot, but now it is no longer on the menu. The quinoa side has changed also; I am not a fan of the new lentils they've added, but oh well. On the drink menu, the mintade sounds appealing, but I found it to have a rather strange taste, and probably will not want to pay $3 for a drink there anymore. There is also a selection of beer and wine you can choose from.
