Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only cons are that the line can get backed up and the hours are a bit weird for me. Breakfast ends at 10:30 (makes me think of that McDonald's scene in Big Daddy) and lunch starts at 11. I was caught in between once and had to just order a croissant, but it was so good just not quite what I was in the mood for. also the bags to carry out to-go pastries cannot be carried by the handles bc they break- so, be careful!
