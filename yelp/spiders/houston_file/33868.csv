Local Foods////Today was my first time trying this place and it did not disappoint. First of all, the interior is industrial and very clean looking. When I ordered my food the cashier was very friendly. And when I got my food, it tasted awesome! I ordered the crunchy chicken with the soba noodles and housemade chips as my sides, all of which tasted delicious! The meal was really filling and I actually could only finish half of my sandwich, so you definitely get what you paid for. I am definitely hooked and will totally come back when I'm in the mood for sandwiches.
