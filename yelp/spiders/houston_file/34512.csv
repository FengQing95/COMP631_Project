Local Foods////Been here a few times now. My go to and love is the GULF SHRIMP & CRAB GREEN GODDESS, PICKLED RED ONION, TOMATO, CIABATTA sandwich. It is so refreshing and the perfect blend of flavors. I chose to get the seasonal fruit (watermelon) and the soba noodles as my sides. I still don't really know what soba noodles are, but I know the flavor and texture were a divine addition to my sandwich. I felt like I belonged here. Everyone was so nice and into fresh and yummy food. I plan to return many times and explore their menu. You can't go wrong!
