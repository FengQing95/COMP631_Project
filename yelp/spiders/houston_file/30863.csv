The Pit Room////First time at this place and didn't disappoint, I even decided to drop the money to get the beef rib so I could get a true taste of what their bbq was working with. Ended up tasting really good. Seasoned very well with crispy bark on outside (give the rib a A- since I have no other beef rib to compare it to) lol... green beans were interesting because they're charred and have unique taste that makes you eat more and more (B+) and elote (corn) was good too especially when you add all the toppings.
