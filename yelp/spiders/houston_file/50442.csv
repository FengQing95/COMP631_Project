Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is AMAZING. I came here with a friend for Sunday brunch around 1PM, and despite the busyness of the restaurant I had such a fantastic meal. The wait time was around one hour, Â but the bar is open seating. So if you're ruthless (AKA: me), you can quietly stalk someone at the bar and scoop up their seats when they leave.
