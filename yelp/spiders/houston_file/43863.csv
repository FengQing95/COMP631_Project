Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After finally finding the time to make my way down to montrose, I decided I needed to finally stop in. Didn't want to buy into the hype of this place but I'll eat crow and admit that this place is great! Aside from the parking situation which was rough. Parking lot was constantly filled, so I had to find parking in the neighborhood.
