JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michael - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your candor and your kind words. I can only say that just a few years ago, Houstonians had very few options in terms of authentic Japanese ramen, but today there are myriad options. So I think we can all be grateful for that.
