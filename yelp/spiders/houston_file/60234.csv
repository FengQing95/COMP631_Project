Baby Barnaby's////Love eating breakfast here! Even though you would think it would be the same, it is so much better than the regular Barnaby's for breakfast. Everything is always cooked just right and served hot. The place is really small but service is pretty quick so they turn over tables fast. Staff is friendly and the place is always clean.
