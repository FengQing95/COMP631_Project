JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////From your review, though, it sounds like your server did provide good service, and for that I am grateful. However, this hurried atmosphere is no excuse to forego greetings or decorum when interacting with customers. I have spoken (and will continue to speak) to my front of house about this issue and how best to avoid it in the future. In addition, management is still trying to determine a workaround for minor traffic jams caused by customers clustering near the side of the bar while waiting for tables to open. Unfortunately, this is an area where our hostesses, servers, bartenders and barbacks must move around a lot in order to provide drinks and food for their customers. We will work harder.
