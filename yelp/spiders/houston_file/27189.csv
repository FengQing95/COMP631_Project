The Pit Room////I always get the slaw which is more tangy and peppery and less mayonnaise-y than most slaws (it is the opposite of slaw at places like KFC or Raising Cane's). The potato salad and the charro beans are also really good. I find that the mac N cheese has a slightly waxy texture that kind of turns me off. The cheese is almost too smooth, if you know what I mean. Don't miss the little condiments bar as there are lots of awesome spicy and pickles fixins in there.
