Uchi////Machi Cure (raw) - Smoked baby yellowtail with a delicate yucca crisp, sweet sensation of Asian pear pieces, and crunchy marcona almond and garlic brittle. This was my favorite of the night! All my senses were finally awaken from sweet to savory to crunchy and buttery. I couldn't get enough of this dish. Machi Cure is sushi done right.
