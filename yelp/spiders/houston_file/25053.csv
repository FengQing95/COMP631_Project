Uchi////It was a girls dinner during happy hour and we had a great time. Food was absolutely delicious! Service was fantastic (very busy during happy hour) and very attentive. There is something for everyone, our party had 2 adventurous sushi lovers, a vegetarian, and a non sushi admirer. There is a vegetarian menu (huge plus because I'm the vegetarian) and there's also something for meat lovers. I've missed sushi since my recent transition to becoming a vegetarian but I honestly left feeling completely satisfied. I had the Nasu (Japanese eggplant) and the Chef's choice makimono and both were delicious.
