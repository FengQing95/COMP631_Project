Uchi////When the walu walu came out and after the first bite, my husband said he wanted to renew our vows and punch someone in the face at the same time. Now, this may seem a little harsh, but I knew exactly what he meant, because I was thinking the same thing. It was so overwhelmingly good. It's like when you see something that's so cute your brain is overloaded and you want to squeeze it until it explodes (don't worry, our cats are ugly).
