Uchi////Ham & Eggs (cooked) - a pork belly type roll that was fatty and flavorless. The "medley" of sauces as was described wasn't to my liking. One was an egg custard mix. I am a big person that likes my food to have a certain texture consistency and the fatty pork belly meat did not meld well with the egg custardy taste of the sauce.
