Local Foods////Can't get enough of Local Foods!  I've been a big fan since day 1 and have tried a variety of their dishes.  My favorite is the bagel with smoked salmon, and I always get double kale as my side.  Their soup is delicious as well!  The Asian Chicken salad is fantastic and has the perfect, slightly gingery dressing.  I also looooove the crunchy chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun.  TIP: You can turn any sandwich into a salad!  I haven't done this with the bagel, because I'm usually too hungry to give up the actual bagel itself.
