JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite Ramen bar in Houston. You can't go wrong with any of the pork based broth options and can add on any ingredients you would like a la carte. The spicy chicken is a staple, but my favorite dish is actually the vegetarian option. The broth is creamy and full of flavor.
