The Pit Room////Good choice for bbq in town. I felt that Gatlins isn't as goood compared to here ever since Gatlins moved to their new spot. Really like their beef ribs and you don't have to wait for only Saturday. Close to st. Thomas which is great plus since my son takes classes there. Not as good compared to Killens but not as far of a drive either.
