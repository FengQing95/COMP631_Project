Local Foods////I have to write another review, since my visits to local foods has decreased drastically. I am still a big fan of the concept, and the staff is still amazing. Having said that, I understand the menu is seasonal and does change. The caper tuna salad was the reason I kept coming back, and it has been off the menu for probably 6 months or so. I am really unsure what is seasonal about tuna, but so disappointed. On a brighter note, the summer salad is really amazing!
