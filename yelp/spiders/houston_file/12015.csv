JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since the ramen is ultra savory, I always order dessert to balance out the visit. The green tea mochi ice cream balls are definitely worth trying! The order comes with two balls of green tea ice cream (SO cold, SO refreshing) wrapped in rice flour. I absolutely love the textures you experience when biting into this little dessert.
