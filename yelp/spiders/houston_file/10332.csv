JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The last time my girlfriend and I visited JINYA, we ordered the Tonkotsu Assari, and Spicy Chicken Ramen.  The Tonkotsu Assari looked and tasted fantastic!  The rich, salty, creamy pork broth was comparable to most of the famous ramen places I've been to in NYC (my standard for ramen in the US).  My girlfriend loved the Spicy Chicken Ramen as well.  We were both impressed that JINYA was able to emulate the richness of a pork broth for a chicken ramen.  They currently don't have tsukemen, my favorite style of ramen, but hopefully with enough badgering that will happen.
