Local Foods////Crunchy chicken sandwich - YUM. Good chicken sandwich. I add the hot sauce they have and it's so good. Very filling. The sides it comes with seem to be a hit/miss for me. Been there probably more than 5 times now and I can't remember any of them that I loved. None of them stood out majorly.
