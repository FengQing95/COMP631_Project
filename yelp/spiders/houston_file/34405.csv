Local Foods////In terms of food, my favorite sandwich is the gulf shrimp and blue crab. They definitely didn't skimp on the filling as without the toothpick, the delicious and crunchy shrimp and crab would've fallen everywhere. Plus the dressing that comes with it really heightens the salty flavor. In term of sides, I prefer the quinoa and the kale. Also, I've had the chicken soup before, and to be honest, it's nothing special, and it'd be way more worth to get two sides. Finally, I really like their mintade. It has a strong citrusy flavor that goes along with all the other refreshing food.
