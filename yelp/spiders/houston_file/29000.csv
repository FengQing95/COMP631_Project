The Pit Room//// was friday evening about 4:30pm and it wasnt too packed when we arrived. We ordered the dinner plates. I order the 3 meat plate and chose brisket, por ribs and cheddar jalapeno sausage . My sides were the elote and mustard potato salad. The brisket lacked flavor. It was a bit dry and cold.the pork rib was juicy but also lacked flavor. The cheddar jalapeno sausage was really good. It was my favorite. The bbq sauce is good but not great. The sides were also just ok. Dont get me wrong, the food isnt bad, it's just not outstanding. Â My favorite thing about this place is the staff. They are so friendly and helpful. They come around asking how everything is or just to converse.
