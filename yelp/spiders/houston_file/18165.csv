Uchi////Fried milk: Another definite highlight of the meal. This was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It's supposed to be a play on chocolate chip cookies and milk, and that's just what it tasted like. Bizarre!! There are two fried squares of BATTER-FRIED pastry cream, two chocolate crisps, a chocolate cream square, cornflake crumbles, and milk sorbet. Try to get all of these aspects into one spoonful and you've got the perfect bite.
