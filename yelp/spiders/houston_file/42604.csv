Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The plain croissants are big and flakey and the inside was hollow.  The bostock is amazing, day old brioche baked with almond paste, topped with sliced almonds and dusted with powdered sugar.  The Kouign-amann is out of this world and is my favorite pastry so far!  It is buttery goodness with caramelized sugar on top.  Get this, you won't regret it!!
