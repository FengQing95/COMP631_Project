Local Foods////I had the kale and quinoa as sides, but I didn't get all the hoopla about the kale.  I prefer creamier kale salads, and this one bored me a bit.  The quinoa was delicious though!  And my friend's garbanzo bean salad was tasty, so I'd check that out next time.  The butterscotch brownie was more of a blondie reminiscent of pecan pie.  Good, but not great.
