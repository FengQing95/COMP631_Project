JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Brought my wife and the 5 kids to check out JINYA and we were treated to a nice ramen experience. The food was great and the service was friendly. The waiter was on top of their game and all questions were answered with genuine and thoughtful replies. Remember, I brought in 5 kids - they ALL had questions. Looking forward to our next trip to JINYA!
