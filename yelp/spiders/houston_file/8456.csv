JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So I usually LOVE jinya and with the weather being so rainy lately; my fianc√© and I decided to get a to go order. The ramen was mediocre at best. I ordered my favorite tonkotsu spicy and he got it mild. We were both upset to see that the egg was cooked through, the noodles were hard and stuck together and was just a kiss tonight. Definitely won't be ordering takeout from them anymore as it was a huge waste of money.
