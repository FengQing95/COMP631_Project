Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancakes are very delicious. they brought a free one to us, but don't go in expecting to get that. we just got water spilled on us so. and they really liked us. Good food, cool atmosphere. atrocious line before. pricey. like a diner on steroids but the brunch is beautiful and flavorful so. noisy, but good music selection -a collaborative effort review
