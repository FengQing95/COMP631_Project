Kata Robata////Aside from the traditional Japanese dishes, Kata's other entree dishes and signature rolls are either innovative combinations of unlikely ingredients like the signature lobster mac and cheese or luxurious congregations of traditional Japanese ingredients. One example of a luxurious congregation is the Longhorn Roll ($15), a fusion sushi roll that boasts a proud roster of shrimp tempura and grilled eel with each piece topped with a large avocado piece and drizzled with unagi sauce and three kinds of flying fish roes. Kata Robata aims to deliver a surprising symphony of tastes with a unique ensemble or a large orchestra of ingredients.
