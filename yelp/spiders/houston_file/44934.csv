Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place does get very packed on the weekends and is not a great study place as they only offer one free hour of wifi. You'll also start to feel pretty guilty taking up quality table space with your computer while people are waiting around for a table. I would also say they're not great for large groups as it's pretty tightly packed inside. There's really no reason to deprive yourself any longer of the sweet and savory offerings here. Just indulge yourself a little.
