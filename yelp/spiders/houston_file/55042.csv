Kata Robata////My first time there and a 30 minute wait on a Friday night but very worth the wait. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The green tea cheesecake was divine and a must try if you're a fan of green tea. To die for for. The service was excellent and the ambiance very nice and relaxing to be in. This restaurant really made my B'day memorable, thank you!
