Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best coffee in town. I usually have a vanilla latte. I like the pastries as well but I think they are over priced. I love thr ambiance and the people who work there are nice. I take my grandpa and boyfriend there as well. They love it too. I usually go two to three times a week. I can't get enough of the lattes!
