Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My girlfriends kidnapped me for my birthday and took me here! I was intimidated by the line at forst because it literally WRAPPED around the front of the store. But it moved quickly. I was so overwhelmed with the noise and surprise of it all,but it was so good. I ended up with the proscuitto and artichoke flatbread,and a pistachio croissant and a hibicus mimosa.
