Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////To make things crazier, the coffee was also straight-up excellent.  They were serving the latest Amaya Roastery offering.  And, yes, you can get refills!  The environment is modern, airy, and filled with happy customers.  Given how good the food was, I was expecting a snobby set, but it wasn't that at all.
