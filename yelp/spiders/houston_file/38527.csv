Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay! So Mr. Reed (Owner) personally invited me back for a visit to redeem themselves from the first experience we had there about 3 weeks ago! Let Â Me Tell You!! From the complimentary Valet to our table we had nothing but 5 star service, smiles and the warmest of welcomes! I was not paid nor solicited to give an awesome review this is my real life experience. Our waiter, JEREMY, is literally one of the best waiters we've ever had! His timing was PERFECT, his knowledge was ON POINT & all on of his RECOMMENDATIONS were TASTY!! We had pork hush puppies with a mustard based sauce yummmyyy, my husband tore them up! My husband ordered the BossBurger and I the shrimp and grits! LISTEN LINDAAAAA!! The shrimp and grits are sooo delicious Omgosh! And I literally had shrimp in every single bite! I ran out of grits there were so many shrimp. The tomato based sauce they used was mild and fresh veggies cooked into the sauce which was such a nice touch. The grits were creamy, smooth but with that homemade feel with the small baby lumps here and there. I really want a bowl of grits (we will be back for brunch!). My seasonal lemonade was delicious I could drink a gallon, seriously. I love lemonade. Jeremy gave us plenty of time alone but also checked on us in such timely manner without the hassle feeling. He has this down to a science! . He knew the menu in and out as well!
