JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Each time I've been, I've been with my handsome and his brother. So I have some Ramen pictures that weren't of my dish. (Sorry, I know they won't help without captions, but maybe the pics will ignite a hankering for Jinya.) We did however all dig into the crispy chicken (pictured). Good but not my ideal app. However, the guys always want this and I'm up for whatever when I'm in good company.
