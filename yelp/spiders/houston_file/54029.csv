Kata Robata////I ordered their shrimp tempura which I found it was pricey for 2 shrimp tempura at $9. It didn't come with shoyu with grated daikon as dipping sauce but instead yuzu salt and green tea salt. Weird! I guess the tempura was good since my 2.5 years old toddler chowdown like crazy and said, 'mommy this is good":)
