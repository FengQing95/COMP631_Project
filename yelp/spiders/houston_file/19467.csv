Uchi////You must go to Uchi, either in Houston or Austin. The food is unlike anything you have ever had but at the same time familiar. The reason I say this is I think the chefs at Uchi are obsessed with balance of the food. There is a depth to great food when all the textures and flavored are all so different and beautiful but meld together in a perfect bite.
