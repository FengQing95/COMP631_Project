The Pit Room////Elote... aka Mexican corn fell short. Now coming from California where we have a lot of very traditional Mexican restaurants, hole in the wall joints, and even your local corn man that serve some of the best elote this was quite disappointing. First of all all the flavor was only at the top and they didn't give enough for you to mix and seep all the way to the bottom. Second the flavors just didn't quite go well together.
