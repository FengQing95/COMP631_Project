Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Lives up to other reviews - well worth the wait. I went the morning of the Astros championship parade and waited about 30min for a table for two. We weren't that hungry, so I wish we had ordered more food and sampled the pancakes! The food is excellent and is better than just a basic breakfast. I look forward to returning again.
