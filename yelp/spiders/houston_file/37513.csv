Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Was looking forward to checking this place out but unfortunately it was a major disappointment. I got a table pretty quick after reserving one on Yelp...but sat at my table for at least 10 minutes before I had to flag down a server. I was planning to eat a dinner here but after I had the hush puppies I kind of lost my appetite. They were dry and just not very good at all, but my waitress said everyone loves them. Weird. The first mojito I ordered was perfect, but the second one tasted like mouthwash. Also, the bathroom situation is awkward. There's 6 separate bathrooms, 3 for men and 3 for women...and a guy that stands back there who tells you to wait your turn then opens the bathroom door for you when one is available. As a woman I didn't like that. I feel like this place is trying to hard but not in the right areas. Definitely not hitting the nail on the head.
