Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Oh wow, how could I now just be discovering this place in the Galleria area? I came here for an early HH with a business guest on Friday. (Their happy hour specials start at 3:00p and go until 6:00p on week days.) They have an excellent local and Texas beer selection, but apparently good cocktails, though we didn't try any this day. The happy hour bites are simply delicious. The short rib grilled cheese and tuna wrap are total steals at $6 and $5, respectively, to be shared easily among two. The HH drink prices are competitive but not as good of a deal as the food. Highly recommended...
