Baby Barnaby's////I live in Austin, but used to live in Houston and had lunch at Barnaby's on a regular basis. My family and I were spending New Years in Houston and the day we were leaving to go back to Austin, Baton Rouge, etc., we decided to grab lunch somewhere. We were packing a 28 lb dog and a 2 year old, so we needed a place kid friendly and dog friendly and (oh what luck) covered outdoor seating since it was sprinkling rain on and off. Well, Baby Barnaby's fit the bill! Â
