Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Over priced! The pastries look incredible, but they really don't taste that great, and they all taste the same. I don't like their regular food at all. This place is always packed and I can't figure out why. They do have beautiful boxes. Parking is a nightmare and the business next door will tow you away if you park in one of their precious parking spaces.
