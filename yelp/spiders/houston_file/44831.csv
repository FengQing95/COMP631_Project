Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yum and yum! The baked goods here are the stuff dreams are made of! The cookies, pastries and bread are fantastic! The price is on par side and worth every sinful bite. The place was super crowded so we took our food to go but the line moved fast. The parking situation is not ideal. The coffee looked good but I wasn't that impressed with the food menu but people seems happy with their meals. Definitely worth the trip!
