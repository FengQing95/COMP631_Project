The Pit Room////Best BBQ in Houston, in my opinion. I've been to several, but this place is consistently the best. My favorite thing to get is the brisket tacos with tortilla chips. Everything I've tried is delicious, though! Also highly recommend the macaroni and cheese & jalape√±o sausage! This is my go-to spot when people are in town and I want to take them somewhere GREAT!
