Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Solid 4 here! Common bond has a great menu that is simple enough to easily make a decision without feeling overwhelmed. The food is cooked with care, although I have seen the portions change drastically over the last 2 years. My favorite meal is the French dip sandwich, the au jus sauce is the perfect balance and always very tasty. The desserts here are like no other! They have so many options, however, my favorite of all is the turtle brownie! The drink options are vast, but my favorite is the lavender latte (which is superb both hot and iced). The ONLY downfall I have to mention here is that because common bond is so dang busy all of the time, it's difficult to even place an order and have it ready in a timely manner, and I have found that when I order for pick up ahead of time, they always wait until I arrive to the restaurant before they "realize" I placed a drink order with the food and I have to wait there for nearly an addition 10 minutes before I can take my items and leave.
