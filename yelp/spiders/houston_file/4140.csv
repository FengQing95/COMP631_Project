JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The broth for the ramen was great--flavorful but not too heavy or overpowering. The assari was a simpler broth, but we loved the extra punch in the black. Noodles were perfectly chewy, and the egg was perfectly soft boiled and flavorful. However, the chashu, though tender, lacked flavor. The meat and egg were both cold in the bowl.
