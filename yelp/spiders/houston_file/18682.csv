Uchi////so what would i order if i had to do it all over again?  of the three different pieces of nigiri i ordered, my recommendation is to just order the mackerel 3 times.  it starts UNDERWHELMING but develops into a complex and delightful finish.  the others finished as they started, flabby and bland.  at $7 for each piece, pick wisely.  at nearly $25 per entree, again, pick wisely.  my recommendation is to order the wildflower alaskan crab, which was actually very very tasty.  ive never had crab prepared that way before, it had a sweetness to it.  and then order the beef.  after all of that, you might feel like you've had a light entree.
