Local Foods////My only complaints usually revolve around the cost and the wait. The restaurant is in a good area of West U, so it gets very packed in there naturally. But between the line for ordering and waiting for your food to be delivered, it usually ends up as a much longer meal/lunchbreak than I had hoped.
