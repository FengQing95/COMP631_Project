Baby Barnaby's////I've been before and the food is good, so was a little disappointed when we showed up to eat Saturday. We were a party of 5 and put our name on the list and waited. And waited. And waited. After 30 min and several parties of 2, 3, and 4 being seated, we asked how much longer and were told it would be a while. I understand that being a party of 5 means we'd have wait, but it didn't even seem like they were trying to accommodate us. We left and went elsewhere where we would be served in a reasonable amount of time.
