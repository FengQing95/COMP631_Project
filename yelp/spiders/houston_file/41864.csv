Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think I just went to heaven. This bakery makes the most astounding chocolate chip cookie ever. I mean ever. Did I mention it had walnuts? Oh so very delicious perfect texture not too crispy yet just crispy enough. Heaven in a bite. I'm sad to right this review because I'll only be competing with all of you for those cookies.
