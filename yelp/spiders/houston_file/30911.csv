The Pit Room////Tried the turkey, pork rib, and brisket. Would go again because the meat was moist and great flavor. Not too salty like some barbecue is. I'm shocked how most even the turkey is. It's $18.95 for a huge side and 3 meats. It's more than what I can eat so you may want to split with someone. Â I teed the Mac and cheese. Loaded with heavy cream. HUGE.
