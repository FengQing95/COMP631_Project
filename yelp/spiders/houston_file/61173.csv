Baby Barnaby's////Another solid breakfast/brunch spot in the heart of Montrose. We ordered the "Green Eggs" and blueberry pancake, both tasted refreshing without being too heavy. Eggs were eggs, the bacon was decently crunchy without being too fatty. The pancake was my favorite because of the texture and substance: it wasn't too soggy or hard, and wasn't so thick to the point where you couldn't finish it. The freshly squeezed orange juice was solid, not too acidic or bitter. Parking is limited to street parking, so be aware of "No Parking" signs. Customer service was excellent, prices were fair considering its brunch food.
