JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm no ramen connoisseur, but this place was pretty good. I've never really found a ramen place I liked so much that I crave it though - I might crave ramen once every 6 months. So maybe I haven't had phenomenal ramen..or maybe I'm just not a huge ramen fan, I'm not so sure.
