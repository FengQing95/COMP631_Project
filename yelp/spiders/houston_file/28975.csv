The Pit Room////Absolutely awesome. I was visiting Houston, and wanted some real good Texas BBQ. Man. The food had so much flavor! Everything was hot and fresh. It was divine. The atmosphere is awesome. We heard there's usually long, long lines. We went on a Thursday evening, I believe, and there was a bit of a line out the door to order. We didn't wait very long, but the wait was well worth it. The brisket tacos were magnificent. The okra was wonderful. My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal, too. BBQ isn't his favorite, but he really enjoyed it.
