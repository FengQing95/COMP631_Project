Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Jackie made our experience at Bosscat one of a kind. She is an experienced waiter who is very attentive to her customers. This was my first time here and she made great recommendations form whisky to the best dish on the menu. She ensured our flow from Appetizer to main dish was at our pace and did not crowed our table with food. I feel like this restaurant had a family fun vibe. The employees that worked there looked happy to be there and did take it as just their job. Overall my experience here was amazing and I can't wait to come back.
