JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////pretty awesome place! Will definitely be back! New favorite ramen place! Â Waitress seemed very knowledgable and thorough. I have an intolerance to onions; so this met a lot to me. Place is a little loud, but honestly I don't enjoy when people say that about places. As a hospitality professional (sommelier) I know places get busy and people are gonna have fun! Great place!
