Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Was on the way to the restaurant and decided to check if they had an online waitlist. Thank God they did because we "skipped" the line and went straight to being seated. Use this feature! We got there and loved the vibe! I went during brunch with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The playlist was a hugggeeee factor in our dining experience. I ordered the avocado sweet potato hash. It tasted great. I wanted to try something different and that dish did the trick. We also ordered the flight (?) of pancakes. Our favorite was the pineapple upside down cake. It was greeeatttf. I will definitely be ordering that the next time I go. Overall great experience, I'm excited to go back!
