Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had made a reservation for New Year's Eve here and the hostess who took my reservation neglected to tell me that they were only doing the special menu which was like $100 per person. So my husband and I, who were not planning on staying out until midnight (so it would not be worth it) had to call another Uber and decide last minute where to go for dinner. Not cool.
