Kata Robata////Every time I go back to Kata I realize I forgot how ridiculously good it actually is and wonder why I haven't been in a while.  The food is definitely not a classic or traditional take on Japanese, but it's avant garde in the best possible way.  The product quality is outstanding, every plating is immaculate, and every time you think about a flavor combination and decide it's not gonna work you're wrong.  Trust Chef.
