Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is... meh. It's has had so much hype but it really doesn't deliver. We waited over an hour for our table, which normally would be okay if you are going to be blown away, right?! When we were seated our table was a little dirty which was a bad start. Then my coffee cup had some lipstick on it and the coffee was mediocre. I ordered one of their Bella! Bella! Benny Benedict which was good! I just wanted to be blown away and I wasn't. A good thing about their Benedicts is that if you can't decide you can choose two and get 1/2 and 1/2. A table near us ordered a pancake flight which looked really amazing. Three pancakes with 3 different toppings. I think this is a good place, I just won't go again until the hype dies down. It's not worth an hour+ wait.
