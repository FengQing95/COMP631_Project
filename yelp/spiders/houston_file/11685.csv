JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ginny - Thank you very much for your 5-star review! We greatly appreciate your kind words. Regarding the timing of your appetizers -- I regret this happens from time to time, usually when we are hit with a deluge of orders in a small window of time. Our ramen and tapas chefs have limited space to prepare these dishes, and the majority of our tapas dishes require a minimum cook time before they can be served. As a result, the best analogy I can offer is this: Our ramen line is like the deck of an aircraft carrier, where we must send out bowls as quickly -- and more importantly, accurately -- as we possibly can. I hope this makes sense, and we will work hard to keep it from happening too regularly.
