Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////came for breakfast with friends and definitely did not disappoint! food was awesome and our waiter was super nice. we couldn't decide on what to order so we all kinda shared everything. faves are the french toast, pancake flight and breakfast tacos.. but seriously, you can't go wrong with anything off the menu :)
