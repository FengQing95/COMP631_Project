JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sprouting Up Ramen - My personal favorite! It has so many great additions to it (roasted brussels sprouts, a seasoned egg, chashu) that make it a high-value choice. The soup is a mix of pork and chicken so it's not quite as rich as tonkotsu alone or as clean/pure as chicken alone, but still manages to capture the savory umami-ness of both.
