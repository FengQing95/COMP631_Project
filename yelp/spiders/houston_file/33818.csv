Local Foods////Love this place so much!  I like to get the sandwich choices as a salad, which brings a ton of greens.  Sides are amazing, and I am really fond of the the cauliflower and garbanzo salad.  Great value for such fresh and delicious local food.  The one thing I don't get about this place is the fact that they have coke products in the back.  It doesn't mesh with the wholesome eating vibe.  They should just stick to the nice teas and eclectic agave sodas that they offer up by the register.  Coke is so mcdonalds...bleck!
