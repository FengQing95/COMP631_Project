JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Darton - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you didn't like our Crispy Chicken. Please know you can always send back any item that doesn't meet your approval. Or if we happen to serve a dish that is subpar, we want to know immediately so we can fix it or offer something more suited to your liking. As far as the seasoned egg in concerned, on our busiest sessions, we will serve upward of 1,000 eggs in a single day, so statistically speaking, we're going to miss the mark every now and then. Again, we are happy to replace these items but we have to know about it. If you search the word "egg" in our 1,700+ reviews, you'll see that this statistical aberration is pretty much on point.
