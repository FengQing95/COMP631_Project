Uchi////I'm not sure why I am even writing this review, since it seems the Yelp community is very much in agreement on the extraordinary experience one has at Uchi (Houston). Maybe it is because I can't stop thinking about those ridiculous, mouth watering, fried brussel sprouts! For those of you who have a natural aversion to Brassica oleracea, I swear even you will not be able to stop eating these small leafy buds of friedness. We ordered three rounds through our whole dinner. But just when you think brussel sprouts in lemon chili were enough green for a swanky dinner, we also ordered the basic Uchi salad. OK, this is by far the tastiest salad I have ever had, and one of the most interesting. You basically are served hydroponic baby romaine leaves in a glass with an edamame, jalapeno dipping sauce. I know... it sounds boring.. I swear on my dead hamster's name... it is by far the most unboring salad you will ever have the pleasure of putting in your mouth. I imagine, some other reviewers have already agreed with me on this... Do yourself a favor and order it when you go to Uchi.
