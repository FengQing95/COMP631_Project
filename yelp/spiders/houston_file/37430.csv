Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I read about this place online this morning in an article that said this was one of 31 "must try"places for brunch in Houston. Four hours later, we were there. Our party of three sat at the corner of the bar. Rustyn was behind the bar, greeted us with a smile and offered suggestions of dishes to try. We started with a carafe of mimosas & a Bloody Mary, followed by Totchos (outstanding tater tots drenched in a cheesy chorizo sauce, topped with jalape√±os & a fried egg) and avocado toast (tasty!). For our main course, we had the pot belly tacos (nice presentation, but there was more sauce than meat), short rib chilaquiles (fantastic!), & chorizo + potato Benedict, & we finished with Fruity Pebbles French Toast (as a shared dish, we ate it as dessert - it's VERY sweet). Service was impeccable, food was perfect, and it's just a really cool place! Valet parking, football games on the TVs. It's a happening place - great place to meet up with friends, cool decor. The down side is there are so many hard surfaces, it's pretty loud, but it didn't bother us.
