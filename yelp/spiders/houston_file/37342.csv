Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went for brunch and bottomless mimosas. I had the chorizo and egg skillet on biscuits which was ok. The mimosas were bottomless but the service was pretty slow so you do not get to drink them back to back as you would expect. You end up paying 40 bucks for a small mediocre plate and 3 mimosas.
