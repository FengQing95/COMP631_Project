Local Foods////I'm also not a fan of duck, but their duck confit surprised me with it's layers of flavor. I never believed in "good" sandwiches either. It's just bread and meat and a thing of lettuce, right? WRONG. I was so, so wrong and I didn't see the light until I had the privilege of devouring their crunchy chicken sandwich, which is a symphony of salty, sweet, and sweet-mother-of-marbles-I-can-die-happy wedged between a pretzel bun. Yes. I just said that. A pretzel bun.
