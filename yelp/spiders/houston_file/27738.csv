The Pit Room////Yes, yes, yes. Every bite was so rich with flavor and was more than I expected. Comparing to the other BBQ I had elsewhere that weekend, The Pit Room definitely tops them all. The sausage was inviting and flavorful that having it with BBQ sauce isn't even necessary; it's still great with or without it. The mustard potato salad was pretty filling and the mac n cheese is what mac and cheese should be. Not dry, right amount of cheesiness, thick and rests in your mouth with pleasure. I had a bite of my brother's elote (which he pronounced ee-low-taay when ordering) and I wanted to keep it for myself.
