JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkatsu blac: the broth is delicioussss especially when eaten with the thick noodles. However, this was extremely heavy and a bit too fatty for me! But if you love garlic, this is the soup for you. It is a pork broth infused with garlic oil. Delicious but I wouldn't get it again :)
