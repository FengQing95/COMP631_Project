JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Well it was worth the wait for the Tonkotsu spicy! I recommend getting that if you like some spice ! However, JINYA tonkotsu black was alright. I just don't like thin noodles. The meat is soo flavorful and juicy OVERALL, this ramen place is by far the BEST for me!! LOVE the atmosphere and service !
