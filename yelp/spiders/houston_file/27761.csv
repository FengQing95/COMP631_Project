The Pit Room////I HIGHLY recommend both my brisket taco and the queso. The queso is smoky, spicy, and smooth. You can tell they use real cheese and a lot of care making it. Easily one of the best quesos I've ever had (and being Southern, you know queso courses through our veins). The brisket itself is ridiculously beautifully cooked - the bark was flavorful and melted in your mouth.
