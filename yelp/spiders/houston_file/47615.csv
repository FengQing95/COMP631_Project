Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great place. There is FREE parking in the next lot. People may think there's a parking fee because there's an "attendant" there. We got there around 7:30ish. Parking attendant said the wait is not bad at that time. He was right. Took less than 5 minutes I think. Was greeted with a smile when we got in. There was a line around 8. We got the booth. Quick and friendly service. Great food. It was on the pricey side, but well worth it just to even try out the place. Clean restroom. A-lox-is was our server. Yes, that's how they spelled her name on my check. I got the Bella Bella Benny and Mocha drink with almond milk (extra .75 for non dairy milk). Delish! Had the hollandaise sauce on the side since I can't have dairy. Will definitely come back.
