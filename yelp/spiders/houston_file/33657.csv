Local Foods////I got the banh mi the first time and smoked salmon sandwich (bagel) the second. Each time I ordered the house chips on the side. The banh mi was fresh and flavorful. I felt full, but still wanted to walk around. It's a great choice for a meal before you're about to do something active.
