JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the inside. I like sitting on stretched out table. The table decorated w/ white rocks in the middle and there are hanging ceiling lamps. When walking in the restaurant, there's a bar at the front. The parking spot is located inside the building behind the restaurant. Not too far to walk. Also came there on a good day. Not a lot of people where lined up. Well, I guess bc it's a holiday. LOL. However, I'm not impressed w/ what I ordered. I got the Jinya chicken ramen and it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. So I tried to make it as flavorful by adding soy sauce but that didn't help. My boyfriend was hungry. Devoured all of it even the broth. I guess he likes it. I wouldn't give up on this restaurant, but I'll definitely come back for a second try and order other ramen on the menu.
