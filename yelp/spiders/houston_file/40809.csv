Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So I went this past Saturday , and I believe brunch was already over that's what I really wanted . So we decided to still give it a try , The location is nice if you love whiskey this is the place to come too , they have gorgeous private rooms full of whiskey bottles For special occasions . My friend had a burger with homemade fries , I had Cajun brick chicken but I wasn't really feeling the dirty rice it was super mushy to me it was ehh . But I sent it back and just got a burger instead it was delicious. We also had a few drinks I believe it was called the good life !! oh yeah we also had a appetizer dip it was okay I believe it's a twist of Buffalo chicken dip . I will definitely be back to try the brunch I've heard so much about !
