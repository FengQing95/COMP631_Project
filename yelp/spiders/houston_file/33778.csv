Local Foods////Came here a few weeks ago for dinner, looking to break up my habit of just grabbing a banh mi somewhere for cheap on Saturday. Ironically enough, when i came here I ended up ordering their banh mi anyways (I wanted to order the Falafel sandwich that was listed on the menu here, but apparently it's been taken off since that menu was posted here). The banh mi was quite good, though not as good as somewhere like Les Girvals. I had chips and slaw for my sides, both of which were very, very good (I actually think I liked the slaw more than I liked my sandwich).
