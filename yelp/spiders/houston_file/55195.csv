Kata Robata////Love this authentic sushi/ ramen place! This place is heaven for authentic ramen. They only have two kinds but they are both amazing. Good quantity yet amazing quality. Sushi rolls are lower on the quantity side for entree...more like for an appetizer. Love their guoza. Drinks are good too.
