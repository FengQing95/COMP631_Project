The Pit Room////The only issue is the consistency of the food quality.  Don't get me wrong, I've never had an outright bad experience at Pit Room, it just alternates between Pretty Good and Great.  For example, sometimes the meat isn't quite warm enough or the Brisket is a little too dry.  Having been to Killen's several times now, the consistent quality of the food there has never failed to impress me.
