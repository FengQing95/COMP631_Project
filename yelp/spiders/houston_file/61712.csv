Baby Barnaby's////First impressions are of a quaint, nice and peaceful location in the middle of a Houston suburb.  The wait is monitored by a simple sign-in system with a sheet where customers write their name, and are called once a table is ready.  This takes forever, and customers are left waiting outside on the sidewalk, as there's minimal seating in the designated waiting area.  Once inside, we were greeted by an outdated, not-so-clean restaurant.  It was very small and cramped, and the restroom was absolutely filthy.  The waitress was very nice and helpful, and provided great service.  Food came out of the kitchen at a reasonable pace, but the quality was so-so.  The eggs were fresh and delicious, but that's about where the compliments end.  The sausage was over cooked, there was no seasoning on anything, the potatoes were not washed before cooking, and I've had better waffles in hotel lobbies.  Barnaby's is an experience to be had by some, but not for me.
