JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Lou - Thank you for the awesome review! We are honored to be your 600th entry, and we are quite impressed at your dedication as a bona fide "foodie." Your opinion is supremely valued. We are also pleased that you took the time to applaud our server Daniel, who has been with us for quite a while. So often good service can get overlooked, or taken for granted, so it's always nice to receive positive feedback. And I think I can honestly say I don't believe we've ever been mentioned in a review as an answer to a poll-quiz, so that's an honor we can now check off our bucket list. Thank you again and we look forward to serving you in the future!
