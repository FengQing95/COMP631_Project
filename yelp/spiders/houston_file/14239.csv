JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The menu looked very nice and a good amount of ramen was offered! The spice levels were I believe milk, spicy, hot, Inferno 1, and Inferno 2. The inferno spice levels I believe weren't shown in the menu, you had to ask. The server was very sweet and she knew a lot about the menu when I had questions. Always attentive and wanted to make sure our first time was great.
