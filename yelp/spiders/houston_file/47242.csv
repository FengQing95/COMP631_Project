Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As my first time eating here, I had high expectations from all of the recommendations from my friends who said this was one of the best breakfast places around. I ordered the snooze spuds the locks, and when I received my food it was missing one of the add-ons that I had requested. The bacon was also a bit overcooked. My food experience was a bit underwhelming, but the staff was friendly and I would be willing to give this place another go.
