Uchi////This place is amazzzing!!!!! My boyfriend and I randomly decided to go on a random Thursday night and the wait was 45 minutes, it was definitely worth waiting for. We stopped by the bar to get a glass of wine and waited outside on their patio (which also has a server, awesome!). We finally got sat at the sushi bar which I heard is the best place to sit because their sushi chefs are so fun and interactive. They were right. My boyfriend and I had the most terrific experience. We sat in front of Yoshi and Patrick. It was our first time and they were nothing but helpful and sincere.
