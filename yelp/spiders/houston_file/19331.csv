Uchi////The service is always incredible.  We have gotten actual "reservations" one time - every other time (about 3) we've just sat at the bar and ate.  It's honestly more fun than sitting at a table. The bartenders make it a more interactive experience with food and drink pairings.  It's the way to go if it's just a party of two and you're adventurous eaters. The foie gras sushi is a MUST. Make sure it's the last bite you have because nothing else will taste as good!
