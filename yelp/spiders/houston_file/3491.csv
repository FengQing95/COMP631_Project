JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nelly - Thank you so much for the 5-star review. And also thank you for the kind words regarding our food and Daniel, who has been with us for quite some time. We always appreciate hearing positive feedback about our serving staff. Above all, though, we are most appreciative of your loyalty, and we promise to maintain our consistency for any and all future visits by you.
