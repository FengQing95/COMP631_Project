Kata Robata////This restaurant was the highlight of our trip. They first give you a warm towel to wipe your hands once seated. We sat near the back door to the patio which the waiters kept going in and out. We didn't seem to mind since the food made up for us freezing. We ordered about 7 items and shared. Portions aren't that big and kept us craving for more. Every single item was a home run. Literally the fois gras melt in your mouth. Would def recommend anyone to come and try anything on the menu. We didn't order any sushi but am sure it would have been as good. Starting to have some kata robata withdrawals back in Boston.
