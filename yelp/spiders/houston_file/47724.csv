Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Loved their egg white Frittata! Delicious pancakes too but the pumpkin spice fall pancakes were a little too sweet for us. Would've given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the wait. Waited 2 hours for a table on a Saturday morning. Once inside we noticed there were a few empty tables. Seems like they could hire more staff to serve more people.
