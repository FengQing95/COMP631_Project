Kata Robata////Kata Robata. Let's talk about it. Stellar service and even better food. The first time I ever went was during happy hour and they had some pretty great drinks and bites. You can't go wrong with the kokonatsu lychee, the rolls are heavenly, and by the grace of the hostess that you get a table here, the miso lobster macaroni and cheese is a must. The menu rotates every now and then with seasonal offerings but the staples are hit after hit. The yuzu marinated salmon sashimi is quite literally *chef's kiss.* I've yet to be disappointed by anything I've tried here and this is my second time around. The scallop sushi was also impeccable. Reservations are probably recommended if you're trying to get a seat here most nights or else it's quite a wait. I went on a regular weekday and it was packed to the brim but was able to get full service over at the bar. Less of a family-oriented style establishment and more like business casual/savvy or fancy date night type of a vibe. And if you're dining here, the bill is $$$ but you know exactly what you're getting yourself into every time. I've dropped a pretty penny here both visits and would gladly do it again. The quality of the food and the service does all the talking. You just have to eat to find out. I still dream about that elevated adult mac and cheese. I would fight a kid for it probably.
