JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cool ramen spot with tall ceilings, nice music and hip atmosphere.  I ordered the tonkotsu black ramen and I thought it was right up there with my favorite ramen in the city.  The egg is served whole and is perfectly cooked.  I requested fresh garlic in my ramen after the bowl had been delivered to the table.  So basically, the waiter let me crush my own garlic with the press, which was pretty cool.  I skipped the appetizers because I'm not keen on any that are typically served at ramen shops.
