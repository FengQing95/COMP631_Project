Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I went no one was wearing masks. They were allowing anyone in without face coverings and putting their employees and others at risk. WILL NOT BE RETURNING OR SUPPORTING, I told all my friends and reported them to the city. Hope this vile company gets what they deserve. Irresponsibility at its upmost form. Check out their Instagram if you don't believe me. I'd be surprised if they still get the same business.
