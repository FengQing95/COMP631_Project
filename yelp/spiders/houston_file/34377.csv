Local Foods////This is the third location I've been to For Local foods. Like the two other locations, this is just as good.. I had vegan chili and it did not disappoint. It seems I've been here before but when it was an Antoine's PO. boy restaurant. The area has really gone upscale and unfortunately that brings traffic. It was really hard to find a space to park and be really careful where you park because you will be towed, no ticket, towed! Just like the other locations plenty of vegan options and alway hardly and wait time to get your food.
