Local Foods////This is one of my favorite restaurants in houston for sure. My only tiff is that they are supposed to be a farm to table but their menu has been almost the same since I have been going for a lil over a year. They have certain items that definitely are not grown this time of year. I would like to know where they are getting these things!
