Kata Robata////Their food is delicious and the service is wonderful! I highly recommend the lobster Mac and cheese and spicy chopped scallops! Their Mac and cheese had a lot of flavor and tasted different from other places. The lobster pieces were yummmm as well. The spicy chopped scallops..... Ugh so YUMS. I can't even describe them. My fav.
