Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So I'm super late reviewing this place. I wanted to give it a try a few times to see if they were consistent and they were. I'm not a huge fruit filled pancake lover (I don't like warm fruit) but my friends LOVED every pancake they ordered for their pancake flight. If you are like me then I would highly recommend the tacos or their burritos soooo good. Customer service was great as well. I recommend getting there early as each time we had to wait about 20-30 mins to be seated which wasn't bad at all.
