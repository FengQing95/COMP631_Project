Local Foods////What I appreciate most about this place is that they serve food that is fresh, delicious, and not greasy (which is altogether too common in Houston). Plus, the interior has a modern look that makes you feel trendy. They have a reasonably-sized parking lot shared with a few other businesses, but beware the lunch crowds.
