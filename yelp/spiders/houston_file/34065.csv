Local Foods////Went there for the first time for lunch today with some co-workers and it was amazing. The crab and shrimp sandwich was sooo good. Had great flavor and even a little kick to it (I don't do spicy but this wasn't bad at all). I also had the chips and fruit as my side. A little disappointed that the fruit was just a big orange and not a medley but after eating half the sandwich and some chips I was too full to even eat the whole thing. Prices weren't too bad either. Overall I'd definitely go back again especially if I'm wanting something healthier to eat.
