Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had the egg white fritata. Delicious! Wanted to try the southwest mule but I was "the driver" :-) My friend loved the pancakes, said they tasted like were from starter batter that adds sour flavor undertone. Was not familiar with concept of starter batter but guess you add to it over time and the starter ferments. Said its popular with cinnamon roll recepies. Not sure if that's what they're doing here, but if so then I'm not a fan of that style, did not care for the flavor. Also the big single pancakes are better than the flight. We all tried each other's. There are 100 different kinds of eggs benedict but my friend was disappointed couldn't get plain one. My friend tried Ham Benedict one and didn't like the smoked cheddar hollandaise sauce on it. Gets crowded fast so get out of bed and go early. Recommend trying lil bit of everything so you can share!
