Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had lunch - not busy at all - maybe 8 tables occupied in the restaurant. Burger and fries were very good as was the chicken pasta. Only complaint was that service was marginal - waiter never checked on us despite empty glasses and condiments requested for the burger when the food was delivered had to be requested a second time and showed up when the majority of the food had been eaten. Would anticipate better service with so few customers. Food very good - service not so much.
