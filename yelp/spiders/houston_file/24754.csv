Uchi////I went here for the first time with my boyfriend last year, and now we make sure we go back every time we are in houston! the quality of the food is amazing and is definitely one of my favorite sushi restaurants in houston! machi cure, hama chili, and walu walu is so good! my boyfriend also likes the oyster shooters(i didn't try it).
