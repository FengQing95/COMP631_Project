JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Meh! I am not really a soup person so no matter how good this was going to turn out, it was never going to be a 5 star experience for me.  I ordered tonkotsu spicy and well it was spicy but I mean nothing that was out of this world.  Yes the ramen noodles tastes a bit better than your instant ramen noodles. It was definitely very pricey.  A bowl of soup and ice tea was a total of $15.  Yes, the atmosphere is fun and trendy but Im really just about the food.  Im not an expert on Ramen Noodles and this was my first try.  If Im going to eat a spicy soup then pho really just hits the spot. Try it so more for the experience.
