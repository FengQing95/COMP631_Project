Local Foods////One word, excellent! This place is a great little spot if you want food with passion behind it.  You can really tell, the ingredients are fresh, and the taste is fresh, wholesome and comforting.  The atmosphere is like being apart of a family. The owners are very nice, and we've even bounced ideas off of each other about creating or recreating dishes that they sell.  This is always a great place to come and enjoy a excellent meal.
