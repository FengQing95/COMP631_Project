JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Let me say I love this place but today was a not so good day. I order the sprouting up and the moment I took two bits my stomach said no. I dont know if it was the hard noodle or if it was the sprout that wasn't done either way my stomach couldn't take it but the good thing is kathy our server was so understanding that she made me something else to go. Â Their broth is usually packed with rich flavor but not today.
