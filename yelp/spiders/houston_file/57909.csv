Kata Robata////My partner and I really enjoyed our experience! This place was popping on a Thursday evening and we got there right at 5pm. Service was good food was awesome! I attached individual reviews with the pictures. We got everything we wanted, was full, and spent ~$160, which is pretty reasonable for the quality of the food! Huge fan of the Foie Gras & Duck Chawanmushi and the banana creme brûlée. There were several layers of flavors that gave those dishes more depth. Definitely will come back to try some other menu items! Glad I found the uchi/uchiko alternative!
