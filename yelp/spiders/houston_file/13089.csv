JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Japanese ramen and appetizers will lean toward the high-sodium side as many of our dishes contain soy sauce. That said, you are always welcome to let your server know you want "less salt" in your ramen and we can accommodate you by withholding certain pre-base mixes that we add to the broth.
