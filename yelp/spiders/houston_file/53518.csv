Kata Robata////I really enjoyed eating here for lunch. Just make sure you get here at 11/11:30, otherwise, parking will be difficult to find. Â I ordered the tempura udon and the waiter was nice enough to put my tempura on the side so that it wouldn't get soggy. The soup wasn't very salty and there were loads of noodles. I just wished there was more than just 2 tempura.
