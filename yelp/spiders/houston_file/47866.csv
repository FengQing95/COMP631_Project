Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So the wife and I were doing a staycation for our anniversary and decided to go check out snooze. We get there and were told that it was an hour and a half wait. No problem, we'll wait because of the great things we've heard. We stood in a line at the bar waiting for our turn to try the mimosas behind a few couples. They all got there drinks by different waiters with no issue or being asked for ID's. So we go and get our drinks and go outside to wait. When we are done I go back inside to get us another mimosa and I'm told by who I found out later was the manager that she needed 2 id's as I'm standing there holding 2 empty glasses. After trying to get my wife's ID i found out she left it at the hotel. She would not budge and would not give her a drink after she had already had one!!!!! She did give me my next drink free but I was still fuming about the situation. I finally let it go realizing that some people are not worth wasting your time on. We just shared the mimosas I continued to buy. On to the food it was phenomenal!!!!!! I had a the pot pie with a side of bacon which was thick and cooked to perfection and my wife had the spuds plate and loved it as well!!!! We will definitely definitely be back again and again and I'll make sure we have our ID's!!!!
