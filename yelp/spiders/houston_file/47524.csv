Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First visit, I waited an hour and half for food that took another hour to come out. The kitchen definitely can't handle when it gets busy. The food was decent. The Benedict was average but the pancake that was comped due to the wait was the best part of the meal. My second experience was without the wait but food still took 30-45 minutes to come out. The restaurant wasn't busy at 10:30 on a weekday. They are comparable to Le peep where you go more for a social outing than the food. The Bloody Mary's looked great though.
