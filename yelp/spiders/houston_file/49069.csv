Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Amazing place! Went there Sunday around 11am and they said the wait is 90 min so we left. Went back again Monday around 10am and the wait was only 10 min. It has a cute brunch atmosphere for dates or with friends. I got the flight which is any 3 pancakes of your choice. I got the hot cocoa, blueberry, and the pancake of the day. Each has its own toppings it's so worth $11.
