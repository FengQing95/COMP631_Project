Baby Barnaby's////I was there this morning, alone and was reading after I finished eating and was asked to leave so they could seat other people. When I asked why I was being asked to leave instead of people that had been there longer than me the waiter simply tried to sugar coat it by saying "I'm not asking you to leave".... but you just did.
