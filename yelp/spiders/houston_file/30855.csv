The Pit Room////OUTSTANDING! I had never in my life had Texas Barbecue before, but this place set the bar REALLY HIGH for me. I had the Chicken, Brisket and Pork Ribs with the Mac and Cheese and Charred Okra. All the meats were super good, but it was the brisket that made me say, "I'd never had brisket the "correct way" before I had it at the Pit Room." Sliced like cutting through butter.
