JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While this may compromise the intended flavor of our ramen, our ultimate goal is for every customer to walk away from our establishment happy and satisfied, which is no easy task. But we must strive for this goal because we have a staff of more than 75 people whose livelihoods -- and the livelihoods of their dependents -- count on our doing so.
