Kata Robata////Grate service and good flavorful food. The only reason this has 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the waiters, he put a plate on our table and ran off without explaining what it was with all the moving parts in it. It was our first time tying out ouster-mushrooms and we freaked out when we saw worm like shavings dancing over them. Then another waiter noticed us freaking out and came to the rescue, explaining that those shavings are part of the dish and that they move reacting to the heat of the mushrooms. They tasted grate and we ordered another one. Oh and btw if you're going to Oder the Kobe beef make sure you are hungry coz it's super fatty but it's so good.
