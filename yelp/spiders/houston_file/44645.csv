Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This was actually an incredibly disappointing experience, but for a very lame reason. I came here with a friend on Sunday at around 2:30 pm, and we ordered some pastries to wait for the lunch menu that we expected after 3. Unfortunately, the restaurant only serves brunch until 3, so we had to go somewhere else for real food, but that was our fault for not looking into it.
