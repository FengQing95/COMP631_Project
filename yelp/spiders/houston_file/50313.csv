Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's best to park on a side street, as the lot fills quite quickly. As mentioned in other reviews, the wait can be daunting. It is absolutely worth it. Pro-tip - go during the middle of the week before lunch, and you'll be seated in less than 30 mins. Enjoy the complimentary coffee while you wait!
