Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Placed a reservation over the phone 5 days in advance. Called 2hrs before the reservation to confirm . Showed up at my reservation time and was told that there was no record of my calling and that I must have called the wrong business. After showing them the records of my calls on my phone they were about to move a chair to a six top for my party of seven. But it was maid very clear that they don't move chairs normally. Unfortunately our reservation time was right at the end of their brunch shift. And we went without a waiter checking on us for almost 30 minutes. There was no communication that we would be getting a new waiter or even that our waiter was leaving.
