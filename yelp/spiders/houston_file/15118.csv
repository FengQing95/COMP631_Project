JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the spicy creamy vegan ramen and it was really good. It came with thicker wavy ramen noodles and a nice broth with chili oil (that actually had a kick to it). The bowl was huge and very filling. The tofu was soft and the pickled veggies in the coup helped to cut the miso broth but also provide a change in texture since it was mostly soft textures. Would recommend this option over the veggie ramen because that's literally a salad on top of ramen noodles.
