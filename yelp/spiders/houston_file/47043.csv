Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came to snooze for breakfast this morning.  I don't know if our name was lost on the wait list for a table but our 45min- 1 hr wait has yet to be called.  At 1 hr 20 we left, luckily because it's been 2 1/2 hours and we still haven't been texted that our table is ready.  I checked with the hostess at 52 min and she said there were a handful of people ahead of us but the girl that checked in right before me was walking out.  Not sure what happened!
