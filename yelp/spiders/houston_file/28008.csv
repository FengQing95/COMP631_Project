The Pit Room////I love the brisket but the pork ribs really take the cake! I wasn't so sure about the charred okra but they were tasty! Must say it is on the pricier side but the quality is there for sure. Can't forget about the staff who were very welcoming. Ambiance and overall energy made a pleasant dining experience.
