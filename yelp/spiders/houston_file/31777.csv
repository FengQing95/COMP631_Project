Local Foods////This eatery has sandwiches, sides and salads featuring ingredients from local farms. Sandwiches comes with two sides, bringing your meal to $10-$12 per person. I think this is really reasonable, they don't skimp on what goes inside your sandwich, and all the ingredients are high quality. So far, we have tried the duck confit, smoked salmon, crunchy chicken, and gulf shrimp and blue crab. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, though I highly recommend the duck confit. It's sort of like a duck salad sandwich with cranberry preserve...it was really innovative and well executed. It's the perfect combination of savory and sweet. Most of the sides are not highly imaginative, but they are good and compliment the sandwiches well. I quite like the red potato salad.
