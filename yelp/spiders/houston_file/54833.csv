Kata Robata////This is a great place to enjoy great sushi! They have an amazing leeche martini and the most amazing tasting sushi I have tried. The bone marrow was by far on of the most tasting dishes I had. I sat in the sushi bar and interacted with the guys making the dishes. They were able to introduce me with amazing tasting dishes. I recommend this place to anyone for a great experience.
