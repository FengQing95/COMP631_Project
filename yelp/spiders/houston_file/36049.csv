Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food is good - a creative menu with some unique and tasty flavor combos - but the customer service is pretty awful. Be prepared for inattentive, forgetful servers who treat you more like a nuisance than a guest. To top it off, I called in before we went to see if they would be showing a particular football game and before I could even finish my question I got a stark "No.", so I didn't request a table nearby a tv with the game on, then come to find out they were showing it and we missed it for no reason (easily could have sat at a different table there to be able to watch it). Otherwise, wine and beer selection is limited but whiskey selection is incredible, and is the only reason I am rating 3 stars instead of 2. In my opinion it doesn't matter how good the food/drinks are, bad customer service can ruin the whole experience.
