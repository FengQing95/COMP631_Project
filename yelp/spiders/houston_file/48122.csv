Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Their pancakes are AWESOME! Yet my most fave was the French toast!! You will have to expect lines here even at an early hour! We made it early at 7:10 am and there was already a wait of 15-20 minutes. After 8 am it will be a long wait of an hour or 2!! However the wait is worth it!! You must try their OMG French toast! Super soft brioche bread stuffed wth Mascarpone, topped with a yummy vanilla creme, salted caramel toasted coconut and bits of fruit on the side.
