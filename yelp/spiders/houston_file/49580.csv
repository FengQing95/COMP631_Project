Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Have visited twice.  Both times food ordered was really nice but refills on coffee slow.  Particularly on the second visit  when coffee refilled the waitress was asked for more cream.  After 10 minute wait still no cream until a waiter walked by and asked if everything ok and told "no" to which he promptly bought fresh coffee with cream! Our waitress never returned until she bought our bill. I wld prefer to have a jug of coffee on the table to self pour.
