The Pit Room////If you're looking for mouth-watering bbq, look no further than The Pit Room. This gem is tucked away in the Montrose area. I had the moist brisket, beef sausage, mac n cheese, and tomato & cucumber salad. Wow. Just wow. I have to admit this was my husband's pick so I was a bit skeptical. But, my oh my, was I surprised when I sank my teeth into the scrumptious brisket. I ate every single bite. The bbq sauce was thick & creamy as well so, of course, I dipped my sausage and brisket in it.
