Uchi////I suggest making a reservation if you want to go for happy hour. I love that their HH menu includes a lot of their specialty dishes. I believe that the size of everything is just cut in half, but it's great because you get to try more items this way. Also, a bottle of sake during this time is only $3, which resulted in me forgetting to take pictures of most of the things we ordered. But hey, I'm not complaining!
