Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Good ideas, appalling execution.  The service was slow and spotty.  The menu offers some interesting, creative dishes. Yet, the actual preparation is sub-par. I tried a couple of eggs Benedict.  The base bread was not properly toasted, and likely stale.  The poached eggs over-cooked. The hollandaise sauce lacking in flavor and quantity, and the most egregious sin, it was clear the dishes were left for too long at the station. When they were brought to our table, they were barely warm.  And I found a piece of plastic in my dish. The hash browns had a good flavor, but could use a lot more crispiness and again, they were cold.  All in all, an underwhelming experience.  I might return just because the menu is interesting, but I will likely choose a different location. The Montrose one didn't make the cut. Chalk another one up for mediocrity.
