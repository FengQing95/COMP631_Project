JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had a bowl of the spicy tonkotsu miso ramen minus the ground pork, plus the chicken chashu, garlic, cabbage, and "american" mushrooms. It was really delicious and filling! Any extra toppings you order come on the side. I think that if you are ordering a topping like cabbage, it's worth getting one order of it to split, since they bring it out on a plate. I would probably skip the chicken next time, since it wasn't anything special. My favorite parts were the thick noodles, spicy bean sprouts, green onion, and mushrooms.
