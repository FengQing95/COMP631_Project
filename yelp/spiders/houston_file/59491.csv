Baby Barnaby's////That being said this place delivers. The green eggs with the chicken sausage are awesome. The buttermilk waffle is great. The thick cut bacon is how bacon is supposed to be made. The biscuits with honey are delicious and the potatoes are decent (I would like to see them bring their potatoes up to the standard of the rest of their menu but they are serviceable.)
