Baby Barnaby's////I didn't find the breakfast to be a total loss since I figured that a bit of time in the microwave would help revive the dish into the consistency it needed, and a bit of hot sauce goes a long way to add flavor. The staff wasn't rude, but they weren't very attentive either. I would say that they were a bit indifferent overall, and the food was good, but not great. I would make a trip back here, but I certainly won't be going out of my way to do so.
