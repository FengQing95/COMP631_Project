Local Foods////I like the atmosphere here.  They were playing some pretty awesome and relaxing reggae music.  I felt like I could completely jam to it.  The booths in the middle of the restaurant are blue and comfortable.  The walls are aesthetically appealing in color as well.  The sandwiches are delicious, and everything is very fresh.  The vegetables they use are grown by local farmers and delivered daily.  The vegetables are organic as well.  I recommend tryin this place if you have never been here.  It can be a little pricey but that is what you pay for when the ingredients are fresh and organic! :)
