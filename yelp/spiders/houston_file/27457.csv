The Pit Room////Brisket tacos always satisfy! I've also had the pleasure of trying the ribs, chopped beef sandwich, turkey, and chicken tacos. All are great but the brisket tacos remain my favorite. As for sides, I'd recommend the elote, mac and cheese and saut√©ed okra. I've never had enough room left for dessert but they look scrumptious!
