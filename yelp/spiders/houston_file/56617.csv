Kata Robata////The sushi was fantastic! Fresh and great flavors. Uni from Japan is my favorite! I'm from California, so I normally have the Santa Barbara uni, but this was so much better. The flavors were more sutble and not super salty like that of Santa Barbara's. The Â  Sashimi were all on point. Scallop and foie gras was of course delicious. It was sliiightly a tad bit bland but creaminess was all there, for sure.
