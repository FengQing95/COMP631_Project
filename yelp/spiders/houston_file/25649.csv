Uchi////Valentines night and oh man was it delicious. The yellow tail was yummy yummy the jasmine cream was delicious. And the orange supreme gave extra freshness to each bite. Â saketoro gosh dang dissolved in my mouth. Definitely need to go try if you're a seafood person. The veggie roll though is a pass for me, wasn't enough oomp.
