Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our server was really nice and had GREAT recommendations, but she also didn't get a chance to check on us so we could let her know about the pancake mix-up for at least 30 mins through the meal. She did give us the cinnamon roll pancake when it came out, and it was fantastic.
