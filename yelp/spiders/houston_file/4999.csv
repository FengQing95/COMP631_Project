JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is one of my favorite restaurants in Houston. The quality of their Ramen is incredible. If you want authentic tasting Japanese Ramen, this is the place to go (and I've been to Japan and had Ramen there). Their Ramen broth is to die for and has definitely been perfected. This place small and is usually crowded so it is best to get there early.
