Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food is good but not worth the long wait. They also need more seating for smaller parties. My friend and I were told wait time would be 35-40 minutes, but it was actually 1 hour. When asked about why it was longer, they said people are sitting and chatting after eating their food. You're a brunch place, do you not know that people like to take their time at brunch?
