The Pit Room////Wow, just wow! We had to stand in line, which was out the door. That was our first indication that we were in the right place! The second was once we were in the door and could smell the amazing food. We were visiting Houston and Texas BBQ was high on our must do list. The Pit Room filled that request perfectly. The ribs and pulled pork were amazing. I also tried the venison sausage and it was delicious! It had such great flavor and wasn't greasy at all. The green beans made the perfect side dish. So happy we came here, it was our best meal in Houston.
