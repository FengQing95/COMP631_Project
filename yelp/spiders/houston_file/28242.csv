The Pit Room////This is probably my favorite BBQ inside the loop. If you aren't feeling the drive to Killens or Pinkerton's I highly recommend pit room. The elote is not the best but the tacos are AMAZING and nicely portioned, and the beef rib is also on point. Plus it's a good price point (especially those tacos!!).
