Local Foods////I had a taste of the roast beef sandwich and I didn't really like it all too well. Something was totally up with the combination of the cheddar and the curried cauliflower that just wasn't hitting it with me, it was slighty chewy and my texture senses were like WHAT, WHY. Also tried the quinoa, was not happy with that one. Just didn't like it.
