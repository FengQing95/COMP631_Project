Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Biscuits and Gravy (Fried Chicken, optional!) - Fluffy, buttermilk biscuits drowned in jalapeno pork sausage gravy and topped with a poached egg. Add in the crispy and juicy fried chicken if you're looking for something extra sinful! Definitely a bit heavy with the gravy and the buttery biscuits, but the spice of the jalapeno and sausage helps cut through it.
