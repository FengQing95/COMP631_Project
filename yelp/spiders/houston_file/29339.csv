The Pit Room////My bf ordered the 3 meat plate with the jalapeno cheese sausage - they were ok.  A bit of a kick to them.. pretty good.  The brisket was decent - definitely tender and pretty good.  I didn't try the pork ribs but they looked a bit dry.   We paid about $60ish for everything and I expected better for what we got.  I think Killen's would still be my preferred BBQ place of choice but they were good.  Nothing to rave about but not horrible.
