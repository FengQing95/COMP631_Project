Local Foods////Maybe the best sandwich shop in the country.  Sandwiches, soups and side dishes are inventive and extremely well executed.  We tried the shrimp and crab sandwich, the duck confit sandwich, the Thai chicken soup and a couple of sides.  We couldn't decide what we liked best because it was all so good.  If my son attends Rice this is one of the places we'll go to on every parent visit.  It really is that good.
