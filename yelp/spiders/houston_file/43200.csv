Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The d√©cor, too. Their large windows are those of a new beach house. They let light shower the staff, who are ever accommodating, seraphic as a children's choir at high noon. Clouds part for Common Bond wait staff. When I hold a brush to a canvas I can't exude such an ethereal quality. No amount of training can replicate the intangible. The light shining into this Montrose cafe during lunch is soft, like the renderings of Vermeer, a woman in an apron arching her back in toil, and yet, the scene is serene and distant, like a walnut cookie behind Plexiglass. How I yearn to reach it. For a macaron that may compete with Laduree, Paris. I used to frequent Laduree with my rich girlfriend back when I was young and pretty, wavy black hair across my forehead, a prominent Adams apple, and her, much more fair than I with ivory skin in Paris...we ate macarons hardly in love with each other but the adventure was sweet.
