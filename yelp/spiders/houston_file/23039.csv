Uchi////Came here for a special occasion and ordered 3 items from happy hour menu, 3 from regular menu. We opted for this b/c the omakase 6-course tasting is basically the same cost as ordering a la carte, so we thought it'd be better to customize our selections. From HH menu, went for ham & egg roll (fave roll from the 3 on that menu!), uzura kinkan (fried quail - kind of like a fancier version of fried chicken; very good!), and snapper saute (honestly my least fave of everything ordered that dinner. The portion was small, and it was well prepared, but nothing special.) From the normal dinner menu, we ordered the maguro sashimi and goat cheese (my absolute fave from the cool tastings), hot rock with wagyu (fun to cook the meat), and hamachi nabe (I love the crusty rice at the bottom; my fave from hot tastings). Service was great as usual!
