Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Awesome place, west european style high quality bread  and other baked goods.  They also have warm sandwiches and other savory dishes.  They do dinner too, changing options (e.g. an artisanal burger, fried chicken) and serve alcohol ($5 Karbach cans, other stuff) . Pricey ($5 almond croissants, but they are really good), full of people at most hours, there's a line out the door already at 8am. Navigating a stroller is tricky (but possible), if you can't fit past the main door, you can push your stroller up the ramp on the side entrance to the patio on Dunlavy.
