JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There was some seating at the bar sporadically. Seating here is much like Tiger Den, few booths for parties of 2, a few for larger parties and then 2 long tables that they will seat whoever, wherever they fit. Definitely do not like this seating arrangement. It gets really tight and obnoxiously loud if you're seated near people who have had too many to drink (like we did), making the dining experience terrible.
