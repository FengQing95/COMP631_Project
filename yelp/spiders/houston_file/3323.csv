JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty delicious ramen! I went during lunch time and ate at the bar which was totally fine and the amount of time it took for the food to come out wasn't terrible. I have passed this place multiple times in the evening and have seen a line coming out of the door, so be prepared for a wait if you plan on having dinner there.
