Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Boss at is a hit or miss , hard to judge the crowd I've been there six times and every time it's a different crowd I don't see any normal C or the crowd stabilizing lots of different people going having parties or groups of parties the food is OK if you're not there by 3:30 or 3:00 pm sometimes they cut you off because they close at four so it just depends on who's at the bar the drinks are very pricey they have cool music due to the cool DJs that rotate no I think I see good about this places you could order a meal and have unlimited Mamosa's
