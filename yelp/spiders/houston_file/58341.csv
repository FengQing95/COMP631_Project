Baby Barnaby's////Yes, yes, yes! Eat here! Patio seating was a bit on the warm side, but the breakfast made it hard to think about anything else. I had eggs, veggie sausage, potatoes (deep fried with a curly fry tasting finish) and biscuits so good I was surprised to find were not homemade. No place gets five stars from me without great service and this place did not disappoint. We left with to go cups of coffee and happy, happy bellies.
