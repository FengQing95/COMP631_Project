JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yes, out of all the Ramen places I have tried in Houston, Jinya is the only one I have cravings for.  The key is the broth - they really mastered it.  My personal favorite is the Tonkutsu Black.  Just the perfect balance of umami, saltiness, and oiliness.  The egg and pork are perfectly cooked as well.  Even though the restaurant is always packed, service is fast, friendly, and attentive.  Good job, y'all!
