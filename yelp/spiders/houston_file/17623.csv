Uchi////I've eaten here twice in the last year.  Nothing short of perfection.  The food is inventive but personable.  I've had great wine pairing recommendations from the staff. This is important and telling to me because it verifies that the staff knows the food.  Rather than go into detail about each item ordered and how much I loved it, I say, just go in there with an open mind and let the server guide you.  Just tell he/she what you like or don't like and see what comes to the table.  They're all small plates and they all offer a culinary journey unlike any other.  By the way, I see no difference from the Austin location which I have frequented a couple of times back in my college days.  Glad to see Austin share Uchi with us.  Now if only Austinites could realize how much better the rest of the food in Houston is compared to Austin. Haha!  Small steps!
