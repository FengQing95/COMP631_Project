Kata Robata////I came here with my sister on Christmas Eve for Happy Hour but they weren't doing Happy Hour. We decided to eat here anyways and ordered the Kobe Beef Skewers and Lobster Mac and Cheese, per the waiter's recommendation. The Kobe Beef Skewers were super tender, fatty, and flavorful and came with a pesto dipping sauce. I love lobster and mac and cheese but the Lobster Mac and Cheese just tasted like your average mac and cheese. I wouldn't recommend it, even though it's apparently one of their most popular dishes. This restaurant is expensive so we will definitely return for Happy Hour! Â Service was really nice, as well.
