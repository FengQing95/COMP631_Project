JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is our favorite spot for ramen in Houston. We have been here on a few occasions and we have never left disappointed in our dining experience. The star of the experience is the ramen, and our personal favorites include the sprouting up ramen (recommended especially for those who like thick noodles) and the spicy chicken ramen which caters the guests who enjoy thin noodles. The edamame and pork gyoza are great starters that can be shared with the table and the customer service is always top-notch. Be prepared for at least 35-40 minute waits during peak dining times on Friday and Saturday nights.
