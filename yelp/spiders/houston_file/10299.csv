JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very nice concept with various selections of ramen to choose from. I would recommend this place for ramen connoisseurs, I enjoyed the setting and the food was delicious. Seating at a community style table is an interesting option for those who do not want such an intimate setting. If you have never been to a ramen house try this place in an effort to truly experience fresh ramen.
