Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is a great spot for chilling with your friends. The people are extremely customer service, but super Cool. The drinks are on point...And the food is what it should be, delish. I tasted the catfish & grits, the pork with polenta and the short rib and I loved them all equally. Â The portions were plenty, we could not finish them and I forgot we had the cornbread appetizer, which were extremely lite for cornbread, delicious but different. This a great spot to really unwind on a Friday after work...
