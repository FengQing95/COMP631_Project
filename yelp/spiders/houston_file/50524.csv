Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So this was my first visit to snooze. I've been hearing a lot of buzz about snooze. So first impression of this place wasn't great. The parking lot at snooze had under 20 spaces so it forces u to park on the street or park at a near by business and risk being towed. If you're lucky you may find a parking space at their establishment or or parallel on the street. Ive heard people parking at jack and the box, Walgreens, or Krogers. Towing signs are all over so just be careful if u want to risk it. Then once u come inside, you put your name on the list and they will text u once it's your turn. Â Although while I was waiting, the hostess let a few people cut the line...... I mean everyone is right there waiting so we all were like what the fuck....we can tell when you let someone cut all of us....
