Baby Barnaby's////My favorite was the banana pancakes and the green eggs!! I highly recommend the green eggs, which are scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts and cheese!! It was so creamy and delicious!! It came with toast, chicken apple sausage and potatoes. The potatoes were bite size and super crispy! The banana pancakes were thick, slightly crispy and moist on the inside. There were slices of bananas on the inside!! I also tried the chicken fried steak, which was smothered in gravy. The gravy was great!! It had chunks of sausage in it. I also got the biscuits and gravy which was delicious as well. The biscuits were sweet and the gravy added the perfect amount of savory taste to the dish.
