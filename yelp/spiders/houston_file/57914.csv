Kata Robata////Absolutely amazing from beginning to end. Stellar customer service. The food came out fast. Our sender Kahn was the BEST! He was so attentive but not too attentive so it was perfect. He gave us time with the menu and described items perfectly. I give this establishment ! We started off with the scallop dish off of the daily specials menu - the scallops were huge and melted like butter in my mouth. The caramelized onion foam and the pur√©e all in one bite with it was so good. This is a tasty dish. Then we did the rising Sun specialty roll. Very good as well. Fresh fish, delicate presentation. Simple and very decadent. We tried the spicy miso ramen and the broth was to die for. I loved it all. I will definitely be going back and I hope I get Kahn again as my server . I have found a new favorite place to go here in Houston. The atmosphere was very nice and the music was the perfect volume to enjoy my dinner with my family. Very good job guys. Thank you for a great experience.
