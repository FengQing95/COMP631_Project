Baby Barnaby's//// The sweet potato fries had too much salt and the dipping sauce was cold barbeque sauce most likely poured straight from a bottle. No one had great things to say about any of their meals besides the person who ate chicken. Salmon, steak, burgers all subpar with very little flavor was the overall consensus. My guacamole burger was good and had a lot of avocado on it but it wasn't something that made me want to come back again. The asparagus was huge and not tasty in the least bit.
