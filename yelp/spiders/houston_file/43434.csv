Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bakery always is well stocked with a high quality pastries. It's a little on the expensive side, Â but well worth it. The service is good even when they get busy. The parking is the worst part. Super small lot, so you either have to get lucky or find parking on the street.
