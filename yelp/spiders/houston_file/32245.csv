Local Foods////But on to the food! The crunchy chicken sandwich? Amazeballs. It is a little misleading though, the chicken is in fact, not crunchy, nor is the rest of the sandwich. I imagined it to be a fried slab of chicken breast with a pecan crust but it's just chopped chicken breast with little nubbins here and there of pecan crust, which totally isn't a bad thing but I just was a little surprised when I received my meal. But pretzel bun AND pecan crust chicken? Hell to the yes. The two sides I got with my sandwich were the cous cous, which had a bunch of shredded carrots and tasted sweet and vinegary, and the chips were simple and good, albeit a little salty. For a sandwich and two sides, the price isn't too bad. Could be a little cheaper, but I'm willing to pay for it. It's one of those meals where you can feel full but not feel like a fat cow. Guilt-free, YAY!
