Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My first time and loved it! There was so much id love to eat, but just couldn't.  I want to have a productive day instead of being drunk on pancakes.  I had the new steak eggs Benedict with a vanilla latte.  Today being the first day to launch it and nothing was wrong with it.  Great place and wonderful smiling staff.
