Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- Pancake flight: got their peach cobbler (AMAZING, has chopped peach inside the batter with sweet creamy topping), chocolate (crisp and warm chocolate chips and soft batter very good), and blueberry danish (lemon curd was such a good accent to this AND there's actually LOTS of blueberries inside!). Our friends also got the upside down pineapple pancake which was also amazing. Tasted like pineapple pie.
