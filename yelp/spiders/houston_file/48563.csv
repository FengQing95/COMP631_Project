Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I actually tried Snooze for the first time in Denver (and it was amazing), so when it came to Houston, I had to check it out. Their pancakes are out of this world amazing, and they give HUGE portion sizes. I shared an order of pancakes with 3 other people, and we each got a good amount. I love that they have pancake flights, so you can try multiple pancakes for the people who can't make up their minds (or love food so much they want to try everything). Same for their eggs benedicts. They give you the option of ordering 2 different egg benny's. I had the Benny Goodman (if you love lox this is for you!) and the Chile Verde Benny. As for the pancakes, I had the pineapple upside down pancake with my friends and we devoured it.
