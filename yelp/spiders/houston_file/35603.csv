Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Dropped in for the Monday steak and Texas beer special ($25). The price wasn't bad, but pretty much every part of the plate was just okay. My strip steak had some cartilage along maybe 20% of the cut and my toast was cold when it arrived. With that being said, the ambiance here is great and the beer selection is pretty good. I'd come back if my friends suggested it for happy hour, but I'll steer clear of the Monday steak special in the future.
