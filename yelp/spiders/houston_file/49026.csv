Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After an hour and a half of waiting, we were finally seated and our food was great. Again, I don't mind waiting, but I do mind when other people are unfairly put above me in line after we were told were next. Management needs to either optimize this system and make it first come first serve, as it should be, or train their hostesses on how to properly use the app to seat guests.
