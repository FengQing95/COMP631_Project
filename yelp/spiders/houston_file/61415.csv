Baby Barnaby's////We waited for almost an hour to get our table but I would say the food was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the green eggs and it was extremely delicious. The restaurant is a bit small but definitely very cute and has its own unique characteristics. I would definitely come again if I'm ever in town again.
