Uchi////Had a table at the community table, met some nice folks and then got that Brussel Sprout Appetizer and BAM NOM MOMN OM NOM it started... that Uchi feeling I was missing. This place is 5 star on point everytime no matter when you come in... this place sets the standard for every where else I dine and the bar is SOOOO darn high.
