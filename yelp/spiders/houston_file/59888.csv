Baby Barnaby's////This has become mine and my husbands favorite breakfast place! There is always a wait, but it's totally worth it. They have indoor and outdoor dining. There is always hot fresh coffee available outside for you to enjoy as you wait. They have a variety of breakfast plates - healthy and not so healthy. Their orange juice is delicious because it's freshly squeezed from real oranges. The staff is always friendly and helpful... Drinks are never less than half full. Service is quick too! Highly recommend!
