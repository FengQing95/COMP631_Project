Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Now on to the food! I ordered the skin fried chicken sandwich and since I'm on a keto diet I asked for no bun and our waitress assured me the chicken was not breaded. Instead of fries I got their brussel sprouts. My girlfriends had the hamburgers. Add ons were avacado and egg. It did come with cheese and bacon.
