Baby Barnaby's////Food: Awesome. I had Green Eggs which came with fried cube potatoes and chicken sausage. I opted for biscuits to go with my eggs. The eggs was delicious, but biscuits were a big WOW! I couldn't even finish the fried potatoes. The serving size was very generous, and it costed me under $10.
