Kata Robata////- Started with their award winning amberjack and foie gras appetizer...which was freaking amazing. Seriously, one bite and you were transported to another level of food heaven. Every time one of us reached over to snag a bite, we would let the table convo pause a bit so the person eating could enjoy their little bite of nirvana....it was that good.
