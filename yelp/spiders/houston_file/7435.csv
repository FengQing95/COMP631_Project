JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sausage Freak F. - Thanks for the great review. I hope in the future you can have a sit-down bowl of our ramen, as that is the optimal method of serving it. Regardless, I am very pleased that you still find our fare worthy as takeout. For what it's worth, we serve hundreds of families with children of all ages every day of the week. With all due respect, we have not found any hindrances in this regard, and we are happy to serve customers of all ages. Beyond that, however, I greatly appreciate your kind words.
