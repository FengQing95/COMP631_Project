Uchi////Uchi isn't cheap, but to me, the dining experience makes up for it. The only thing I'd say to improve on the value and overall dining experience is if the nigiri pieces were cut a smidgen thicker and just a bit longer. They're literally the size of my pinky, when I'm expecting something around index finger sized nigiri.
