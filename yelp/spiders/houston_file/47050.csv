Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went here on a weekday for lunch, the place was slammed and we had to wait about 20 minutes. I do not mind waiting whatsoever but there were about four empty tables that were dirty and a group of staff just chit-chatting. For this reason, and that the waitress seemed flustered and rushed which in turn made her unfriendly and unwelcoming, I give three stars. Â But, the food was nothing short of amazing! I am one for second chances and I cannot wait to go back and try more items on the menu!
