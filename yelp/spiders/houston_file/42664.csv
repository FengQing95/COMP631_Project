Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////And lastly, the breads. Do yourself a favor one day, and grab a loaf from Common Bond, hop over to Central Market, and fill your basket with cheese and cured meats, grab a bottle of sparkling wine, and then enjoy. After you've tasted the love poured into every square inch of that loaf, then you will have enjoyed life. And yes, that might just be enough to keep anyone content.
