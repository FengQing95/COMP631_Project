Uchi////- Dessert - The tasting comes with one dessert, but upon telling our waiter that we did not enjoy the pork dish, he brought us two desserts.  The first was very unique (cantaloupe sherbet with buttermilk foam) - good flavor, but not something I would need to try again.  The second was peanut butter semifreddo, which is deconstructed peanut butter and jelly.  If you eat all the components together it really does taste like a true PB&J.  I recommend trying this if this is not your tasting dessert.
