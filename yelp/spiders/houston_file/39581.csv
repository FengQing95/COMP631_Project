Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Parmesan-crusted meatloaf bites (4.5/5): Ma, the meatloaf! I'm not a meatloaf guy so I typically never order a dish like this. It was highly recommended by the staff, however, and they were right. The breading really did it here as the bites were nice and crispy. Some of the best meatloaf I've ever had and it was complemented by a nice sauce. We're starting to see a trend here. Bosscat is all about dipping sauces.
