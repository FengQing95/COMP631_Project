Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The establishment was nice and clean with interesting decor; there was plenty of things to look at while waiting in line, and the smell of fresh baked bread was also a plus. It does seem a bit chaotic as you are navigating through the place as it is usually packed with people and workers weaving in and out delivering orders and cleaning tables.
