Uchi////To start off, the host staff was very accommodating. There was a mix-up with our reservation, but they were very nice and asked us to wait and would try to get us a seat as soon as possible. We expected a wait of over an hour due to how busy it was, but they had us seated in about 30 minutes. Once seated, my wife and I decided to try to six course Signature Tasting. Each dish was beautifully and thoughtfully presented and explained well by the server. We also ordered two orders of Uni and was asked to eat it a certain way to fully enjoy the explosive flavor Uni offered. It was amazing!
