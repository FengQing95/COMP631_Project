Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The fresh buttery baked good smell coming from the bakery is intoxicating. After waiting in the long line and being teased by all the goodies in the window case as you anxiously decide what to order...you may be tempted to order everything. Can't choose? Hands down - get the almond croissant. This thing is massive but oh-so flaky and delicious with that almond paste that I always wish they'd put more in so I could savor it with every bite.
