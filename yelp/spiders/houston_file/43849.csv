Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is the new kid on the block of popular eats in htown, and I must say I love this place!!!  It is a cafe and bakery which is super cute with open seating/communal table seating both inside and outside on their patio area, but wherever you are, you can people watch thanks to windows everywhere!  You can even sit around the barista station and watch the baristas do their magic.  Sadly, I also caught one continuously touching their hair and other random parts of their body and then serving drinks...I was quite disturbed.  I actually ordered a latte which was just average, but they do get their roast from Boomtown, so you gotta love local!  OK, down to the serious stuff... food!
