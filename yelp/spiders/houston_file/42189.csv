Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It was better a few years ago. Seems like they have sold out with the screen menus, bitter coffee, and there just seems to be something missing with the food as well. I can almost sense the lack of care that it once had. Two years ago, this would have been easily five stars. Now, just expect an average coffee shop and bakery if you go here.
