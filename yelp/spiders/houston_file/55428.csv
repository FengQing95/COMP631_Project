Kata Robata////Uchi gave our table away for being 10 minutes late. We ended up here instead and were seated after 20 min (walk in) - reasonable wait. The food was simply excellent - and I think much better than Uchi. Service was very attentive and food came out very quickly. Kata saved our night after being snubbed at Uchi. Will gladly give them my money instead again and again. I'll be back soon.
