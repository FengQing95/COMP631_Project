Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time to this place and it came highly recommended especially for brunch and I could not be more satisfied not only with amazing well plated tasty food but also the friendliest knowledgeable bar staff! Brunch rush was happening and Gavin did not miss a beat and killed every aspect of his job, not to mention, he is a fellow Red Raider !! Great job to everyone in this establishment on every level!!!
