Uchi////The best sushi spot in houston. I used to prefer uptown sushi but this spot is awesome. Im in town for work probably 15 days a month and this place is spectacular. I admit im not a houstonian but am familiar with sushi spots and this is definitely at the top for right now. The location is perfect, very central to everything love going by here then hitting up catbirds nearby or anvil.
