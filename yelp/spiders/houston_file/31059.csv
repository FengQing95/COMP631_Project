The Pit Room////I got the 2 plate dinner with brisket and smoked chicken. The brisket had an amazing flavor and I love that instead or relying on sauce, the seasoning and oils took over. The potato salad side was incredible with a nice mustard flavor. The chips were awesome to since they give you a side of bbq sauce to dip in
