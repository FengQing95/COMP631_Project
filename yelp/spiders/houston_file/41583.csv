Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went here on a Saturday at around noon and was super happy with the experience. It's a cool space and the food and coffee were delicious. We were super impressed with how fast the service was for how busy it was, it seemed like the moment people were gone from their tables, the staff had it cleaned and ready for the next customer. The coffee and food came out really quickly as well.
