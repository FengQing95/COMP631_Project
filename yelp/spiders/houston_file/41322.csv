Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time coming and I was amazed. I have never taste anything this good for its prices. Its prices but your getting what your paying. The lines were long but not as long as our famous Breakfast Klub. Just a little ways off from the door. Its a small sitting place but you can find a seat if you ask the other customers nicely for a chair. The food was colorful and wonderful. I had the Hawaiian Royals and it was beautiful! I mean it. The pork was chewy and well seasoned. The sauce was better then any sauce glazing I have ever tasted. If I knew food better then an average customer I could explain how good this dish was. I went here with my step dad. He had the Boudian and Potato Salad. A bit spicy but good. Anyway, you should just go here and try it. You will love the food. The pastries I haven't got try yet. I brought it home with me. If you are here for a meal but want a pastry take the pastry for to go. You won't be able to eat it after you have had your meal.
