JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service was even better. During busy lunch hour, my coworker and I never had to wait for drink refills, the staff was very [authentically] friendly, the food was tasty, and the check was brought immediately. I will definitely return as the food is pretty good, they provide quick, pleasant service, and its proximity to my job allows for a very convenient trip!
