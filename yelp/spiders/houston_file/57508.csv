Kata Robata////-miso lobster Mac and cheese - this Mac and cheese is the bomb. The taste is unique and is not your standard Mac and cheese. It's a little more on the saltier side for me the more I eat it but I still like it a lot. The sauce and pasta shell is cooked right and very moist (because some places' Mac and cheese is really dry).
