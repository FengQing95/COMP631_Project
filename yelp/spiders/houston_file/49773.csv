Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze's menu gives you the chance to mix different dishes if you can't decide on one single thing. So I ordered the Benny Duo (Chile verde with pulled pork Benny and Bella Bella) it was delicious! My girl had the full Chile verde Benny and we shared a baby pancake of the day and a half omg French toast order as recommended by Travis.
