Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The rave reviews about brunch might entice me to give them a second chance, but it wouldn't be something I'd seek out by myself. The glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc I had for $12 was fairly decent - so perhaps I'd find more success in the "Libations" part of the restaurant. Any friends want to invite me for drinks? ( °  °)
