The Pit Room////I used to live across the street and I saw this place grow tremendously. And the reason was great barbeque! They offer all the usuals, brisket, ribs, sausage. Ribs sell out by the end of the day.  You can take your food to the sister bar, The Patio.  They also do tacos with a barbecue twist. Very heavy but definitely worth a try.  My usual is the brisket.
