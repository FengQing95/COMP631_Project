Kata Robata////The dessert was interesting to say the least. We split an order of the Chocolate Mousse which was large enough to split between atleast 4 people. The Mousse was a deconstruction of everything familiar to us.. with air whisked into a frozen mousse to create almost a sorbet like texture and a nitrogen oxide frozen merengue broken and mixed into the mousse it created more conversation than flavor.
