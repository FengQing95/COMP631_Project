The Pit Room////Had family visit from out of town and they wanted BBq. I had no idea this place existed. Yelp helped in finding this place. Thank you Yelp! Born and raised in Houston and I've had plenty of BBQ from different establishments. I must say that this was probably the best I've had. Everything was great but the beef rib, wow!! If you have any doubts about trying this place, stop them! You will not be disappointed!
