The Pit Room////I just moved to Houston from Austin and I was really missing good BBQ so I was thrilled when the Pit Room finally opened. I've been 5 times since they opened and loved it a little more every time. The brisket is fantastic, the mac and cheese is to die for, and the ice cream sandwiches are heavenly.
