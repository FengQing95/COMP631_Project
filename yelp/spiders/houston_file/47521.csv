Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got a combo of the ham Benedict lll and the Benny Goodman with a mocha. It was so good, May attended the counter and helped me as she informed me that I could get a combo of the Benedict. She said they come with hash browns which I didn't want so she suggested a salad. It was delicious as well.
