JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Got JINYA for take out tonight. The ramen ingredients came packaged separate from the broth, and transported very easily. Instructions for assembling the ramen were attached to the receipt (very helpful). It was my boyfriend's first time getting JINYA, and he ordered the Cilantro Chicken. I had hyped this place up to him, having been there before, but we were sadly not impressed by the Cilantro Chicken. The menu makes it sound flavorful, but it was more of a bland, plain ramen. It also came with only 2 small pieces of chicken in the ramen. Mine, on the other hand, was delicious as usual. I ordered the Flying Vegan, which had a perfect spicy kick to it. I added shrimp wantons (11/10 rating on the wontons), and practically licked the plate clean. Will definitely be back, but neither of us will be ordering the Cilantro Chicken again.
