Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My latte came out first and was the right combination of milky and bitter.  Drinking a nice, hot latte feels like getting a hug on the inside... the hot coffee and warm milk travel down my throat and just warm me up from the inside out!  Once the croque madame arrived, I started to dig in and was pleasantly surprised at how delectable it was!  The bread was soft and warm, the ham salty and sweet, the cheese perfectly melted and had a slight hint of jalapeño flavour to it... just overall scrumptious.  The small cornichons accompanying it was a nice complement as well!  There was a fried egg on top (which makes it a "madame" instead of a "monsieur" ) which could have been a little more runny than what I got, but whatever-still enjoyed it all the same.
