JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really good ramen; would highly recommend for first time ramen diners. They offer multiple levels of spiciness for their spicy chicken ramen but beware - the spicy sauce they use is sour, rather than the kind of purely savory taste you get with chili oil. I love spicy ramen but prefer their normal Tonkatsu.
