Kata Robata////Seated promptly. Hostess was very helpful--got us drinks and pointed out a few items on the menu. Our server had excellent manners. He described the dishes when they came out (sauces, etc), which is a good sign that he knows the menu.  Manager also made his rounds, which is always nice.  The only reason why I'm knocking off 1/2 star because our server could have been more attentive... other waitstaff had to "fill in" throughout the night.
