Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the pancake flight and my hubby got the beni duo. It was all really good and our server was really nice. I can see why there would be a wait at this place on the weekend. Â Luckily, we were able to go on a weekday morning so no wait at all. Unfortunately, the parking lot is small so you most likely have to street park. In the flight you get to choose 3 different pancakes to try so I got the blueberry, sweet potato and the peach cobbler. Surprisingly, the sweet potato was my favorite of the three, but all of them were really good. Hubby thought the eggs Benedict was really good but be prepared for heavy richness from the hollandaise sauce. We would definitely come back.
