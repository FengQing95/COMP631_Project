Kata Robata////It is one of the best sushi places in Houston. Definitely on the high end side price wise. But the atmosphere is very nice. Drinks choice varies from beer to sake. I love their cocktails and they are generous with alcohol. Food choice wise, they Do have variety of food selections from sushi to Japanese fusion dishes. We found out few food from the menu was no longer available. Plus, they were missing a lot of fish, due to Mother's Day. But the waiter was super nice // gave us bowl of edamame.  I really liked their sushi selections including seared salmon belly/ Uni/ chopped scallops. Grilled entree selections wise, I highly recommend hamachi Kama, and ika. They do a good job keeping their quality of  ingredients fresh.
