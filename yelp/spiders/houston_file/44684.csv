Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food: Fortunately (or unfortunately), this French bakery doesn't adhere to the French diet and portions are large. The croissants are huge. If I want to spoil myself (brioche with hazelnut, pain perdu (translation: lost bread in French, meaning ridiculously delicious french toast). If you are looking for a nice lighter morning then the yogurt with granola and homemade jam might be a better option. For something heartier, the torta is delicious.
