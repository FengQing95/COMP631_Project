Uchi////@uchihouston was quite the ride. I tried the vegan taste testing and had waves of different experiences inflicted by the different plates. It was all so good, even the stuff I tried off others I wanted more. The #avocado was jaw-dropping. Not as simple as you'd think. And that king trumpet #mushroom was insane!! 10/10 absolutely perfect it reminded me of squid marinated and grilled. Still in shock just recollecting it. I wouldn't forget to mention the eggplant either, I promise you if you think you're not a fan, prepare to be mind blown. If I had to choose any way to eat eggplant I'd happily choose this  surprisingly it kinda reminded me of a softer pan seared tofurky. Pure though. Not the slightest hint of being processed. I can't say how much was spent bc my stepdad was so kind but I will say this is a treat yo self-meal. Apparently they're one of the most popular restaurants in Japan, their #sushi that contains fish is supposed to be transcendent so I'm excited for round 2. They have a separate menu just for vegans all you have to do is ask  also they have #happyhour from 5-6:30 daily
