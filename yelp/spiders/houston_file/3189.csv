JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chinda - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your comments, though I think it's important I point out that we offer two more spice levels beyond "Hot," which are "Inferno" and "Double Inferno." These are "off-menu" modifications that were borne out of numerous customers' requests to make their broth spicier. Depending on which ramen you order, these levels will include an upcharge of $1. Glad to hear we were able to accommodate your little ones, as well.
