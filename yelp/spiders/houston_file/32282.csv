Local Foods////The sides were all cold (except the potato chips) and each had their own unique flavor. I think the barley or wild rice had a splash of vinegar so it was a little tart, not a problem because that's right up my alley. My favorite sides were the kale, barley, and potato chips. The next time I go back, I will definitely get those chips!
