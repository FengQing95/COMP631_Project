Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a hip breakfast-all-day spot.  The food is good, though a bit pricey for breakfast fare.  You can get the basics, or something with a bit more flair.  I had the smoked salmon light meal.  Really tasty, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting a lighter breakfast.  They biggest downside was the noise level.  Maybe it was an off day, but it was hard to talk at times.  I would absolutely go back, though.
