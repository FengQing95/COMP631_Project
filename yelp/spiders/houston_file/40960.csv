Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For our entree, I ordered the cornmeal crusted fried fish which came with a mushroom sauce rice and drizzle with a tobacco red sauce. Surprisingly, my dish was very good. My husband ordered his usually, pasta. The pasta wasn't to my liking due to it being tomato base however, hubby was satisfied with his meal.
