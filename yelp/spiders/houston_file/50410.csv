Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I do like the food and the fact that you can get a good Bloody Mary before noon (don't judge:-), but I hate to say I got really lousy customer service on my visit this am. I breakfast at Snooze when I'm off on Mondays and am having a cheat day because they offer a service industry discount on that day. I ordered the spud bowl and a BM and asked the bartender (who was not one I'd had before) if the industry discount was still being offered and explained that I'm a flight attendant. She said yes. The first order that came out had bacon on it, which I don't eat and had to go back. No biggie. However, when it was time to pay my bill, the manager (short white girl with gauged earlobes) said I wouldn't be extended the discount. I asked why as it had never been an issue before. She said she would check with another manager and came back singing the same song and proceeded to ask me what the waiters/ bartenders who gave me a discount looked like, etc (I wish I'd thought to ask "do you remember what the last flight attendant who served you looked like?l), and then implied that maybe they were just "hooking me up" and that must have been a long time ago. No, B. I've only lived in Houston a little over a year and heard about the discount from other Flight Attendants. Needless to say, I'll take my hard-earned money elsewhere--discount, or not--because customer service is EVERYTHING.
