Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is my first visit and I am impressed! The decor is beautiful and the environment is the perfect place to chill. The bartender crushed this Old Fashioned my whole table ordered them! The table had mixed reviews on the wings, some felt like the Dr. Pepper flavor was too strong while others felt like the flavor resembled a tasty barbecue. Â Our service was great and was attentive to everyone at the table. I will definitely come back to try more items on the menu and to enjoy this happy hour!
