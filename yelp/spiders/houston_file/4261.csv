JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Pranavi - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you consider us your "go-to" ramen house, especially given the sharp increase in competition as of late. In the coming months we will open more JINYA outposts, which hopefully will alleviate our extended wait times at Midtown. But above all, we appreciate your regular patronage, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
