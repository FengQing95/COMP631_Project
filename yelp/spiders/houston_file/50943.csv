Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The pancake flight wasn't what I imagined. While I should've guessed from the photos, it was a complete sugar bomb. I like sweet, but not THAT sweet. The syrup was everywhere combined with candied nuts and sweetened cream. It was just a lot. The pancakes themselves were good, my favorite being the sweet potato, but that is a one-time experience for me. It's just not something you would really want again IMO. The chicken sausage was solid. I hesitate to rate the pancakes, because I know some people are really into them. I'm a definite dessert person, but I don't like pure sugar, so take that for what it's worth.
