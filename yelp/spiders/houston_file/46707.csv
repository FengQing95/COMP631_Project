Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////6. Tables are not bussed timely. I can't tell you how many times we have taken a table that has not been wiped off. This is a very highly trafficked restaurant, and if management was on top of their game they would make sure that there was a person attending to the patron's floor at all times to immediately bus tables. Instead, the dining area pretty much looks like a pigsty.
