JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Separately, I do agree that homemade ramen will almost always rank higher than food prepared in a restaurant, mostly because it's cheaper, and a restaurant will never be a facsimile of your home environment. That said, I'm pleased to know your server met your needs and expectations, and I hope we are able to serve you again the future.
