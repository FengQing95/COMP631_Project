Uchi////We didn't make reservations, so it was about an hour wait. They take care of you the second you walk in the door. There is a nice area outside where you can wait and order drinks/appetizers. They also periodically come around with sushi samples to tease you with what you are about to experience. That's exactly what Uchi is, an experience. This restaurant is so good that it has ruined sushi at the local sushi places for me from now on. We ordered the 10 course chefs tasting and sat at the sushi bar. It seems like a lot of people don't want to sit at the sushi bar, but that's the place to be. Great guys and fun to interactions. I won't go through all of the courses, but each one was a new level and everything worked together. Our favorites were the Tom Ka soup, 72-hour short rib nigiri sushi, spicy crunchy tuna maki, and the special amberjack nigiri. I can't say enough good things about this place, and it may be the best meal I've ever had. We were there for about 3 hours, so clear out your evening and check this place out!
