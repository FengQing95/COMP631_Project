JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jasmine - Thanks for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. We also think we serve the best ramen in Houston -- although, admittedly, we are a little bit biased on that -- but we can also agree having more options for ramen is a great thing! And those who make ramen very well, will continue to do very well. In summary, ramen fans unite! Thanks again.
