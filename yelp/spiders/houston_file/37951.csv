Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Visiting Houston from CA. Found this gem- place is 10/5 stars! Had the pleasure of being served by Gavin & Tim at the bar. Fantastic service, conversation and laughs. Food was superb- my wife had the tomato soup and grilled cheese, and I had the green chili soup and quesadilla - both to die for. Craft cocktails were amazing as well. To top it off, they have an extensive whiskey/bourbon/scotch selection.
