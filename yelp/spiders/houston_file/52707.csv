Kata Robata////Great place for sushi. We go there about once a week. Sushi is made with great technical skills. Fish is very fresh with great varieties. The udon does not taste like the ones you get from the store. The katsu don from lunch is a bit on the salty side. Agedashi tofu is well made and it's very different from other restaurant. Chicken teriyaki is perfectly cooked. Sushi platter at night is the best kept secret in Houston.
