Kata Robata////I had high hopes for this place after Jim had a good experience here. But alas, this might be the least vegetarian friendly restaurant I've been to in a long time. I appreciate that a sushi restaurant isn't going to be focused on the vegetables, but this place didn't even have vegetable maki rolls on the menu. I cobbled together a dinner by ordering a salad, a tofu appetizer (had to request 'no bonito'), and a futomaki, without the crab. So that's basically only the side-salad that was vegetarian by default.
