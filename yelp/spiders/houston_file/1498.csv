JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's opening weekend, and my boyfriend and I noticed the very very long lines for dinner service over the past couple days.  Fortunately, we went for a late lunch instead, and were seated promptly by a friendly waitress and greeted customarily by the whole staff.  The space is really nifty looking, with deep orange lighting around booths, two sets of bar seating (one at the ramen bar, one at the cocktail bar), and two large family style tables with white rock inlays.  The set up really optimized the space, fitting in many seats in a small restaurant without seeming too congested.
