Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place out in Houston was alright! The vibes were nice and chill. We got to sit outside on the patio. It has a bar inside and there's this cute floral wall at the entrance! The menu is simple but didn't have many options or anything that really stood out that would make me want to try it.
