JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first time at Jinya and I was initially skeptical.  I have never regarded ramen as a meal worth purchasing...since my good ole college days.  However, this place put my preconcieved notions to shame!  I ended up ordering the spicy chicken ramen with medium (spicy) heat.  I really enjoyed the kick of the sauce and I liked that they put the sauce in one container and the chicken and veggies in another so that I could add the sauce as I so pleased.  I would definitely order take out from this place again.  Although the wait was annoying, we knew this was a popular place and factored the wait time into our decision to give it a shot.
