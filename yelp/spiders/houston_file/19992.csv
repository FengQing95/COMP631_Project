Uchi////When you come to Uchi bring a lot of $$$. If you want to get full here bring even more dollar signs. I come here whenever I'm in town just to try new dishes they have and they are usually amazing, small but amazing. The nigiri and sashimi here are smaller than you'll find at a Blue Fish or even Kata but I like it. They don't have any entrees just small dishes and rolls. I guess if I eat more rolls i would get full but I don't really like rolls. I heard that happy hour is a good deal but I never been for happy hour.
