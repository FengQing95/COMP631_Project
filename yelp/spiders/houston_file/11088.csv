JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The first time there, I was seated in the far back in front of the kitchen. Service was good and attentive even when it was busy for lunch time. I order a cha cha ramen that is for garlic lover. When I got my ramen, I try the soup and couldn't taste any garlic nor a good broth. It was a disappointment. The flavor was passable for this type of ramen.
