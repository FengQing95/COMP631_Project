Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is good. I was here twice during the past year. If you want good comfort food breakfast, this is the place to go. I've tried their eggs benedict and it was well made. Be ready to wait, it's usually packed. The good thing is that they will take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Last time I had to wait around 50 minutes but luckily my friend was late so it worked out.
