Uchi////Billy was our server and not only had that sweet Southern boy next door face, but the attitude as well. I wasn't sure if I should tip him or take him home to mom at the end of our meal. He was very friendly, knowledgeable and didn't rush us to order or to make decisions about dishes we were unfamiliar with. We ended up ordering several different dishes that he recommended based on his knowledge of the menu.
