Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been wanting to try this particular location for brunch for quite some time. Unfortunately my experience wasn't that great so I'm not sure I'll return. I have a lot on my mind and somehow didn't notice the line outside. After waiting for at least 10 or 15 minutes in the inside line and getting ready to check out, I had to ask for dine in as the cashier automatically chose to-go.
