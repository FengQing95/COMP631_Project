Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food- I had the snooze classic with the sweet potato pancake added. This has been my favorite until I also had the pineapple upside down pancake OMGGG! Let's just keep this simple...if you haven't eaten here yet I highly suggest you go because you're going to love whatever you order.
