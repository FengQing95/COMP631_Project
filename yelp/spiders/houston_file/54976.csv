Kata Robata////I always enjoy my dining experience here. Wait staff are knowledgeable and professional. They genuinely want you to enjoy the experience. Quality of the seafood is superb... from the cold dishes, hot dishes and sushi. They always offer something new and innovative and bring in amazing fish from Japan and other regions. Last night we had a lightly seared barracuda. It was very delicious - mild but flavorful... skin still in tact but delicious. Chef Hori is the best! Highly recommend!!
