JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been coming here for years and my experience has been good . However, recently this restaurant has been on the decline . They have a young blonde lady at there bar  who is extremely rude . She acts like everything is so hard and stressful. She puts her own emotions off on the guests and it's extremely rude . It absolutely killed my vibe and experience . Furthermore,  the restaurant has a spicy umami ramen they advertise as spicy that's not even spicy . They charge you more for it to be spicy when in the advertisement it's already branded as spicy . This is very misleading to the guests . My last experience was horrible . I will not be retuning . Don't call something spicy and have it included price then charge guest an additional price for spice .
