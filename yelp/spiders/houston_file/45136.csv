Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The fried eggplant topped w/ a fried egg & capers was the true winner in our books though! It was so sweetly savory. & the eggplant was fried so perfectly. If I could only have one thing, it's the eggplant agrodolce (5$). & I would have it so many more times after that.
