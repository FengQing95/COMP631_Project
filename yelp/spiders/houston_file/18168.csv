Uchi////Went to social happy hour for the first time Tuesday after work. There was already a line at 4:50. When the doors opened at 5pm, a server came out and had a tray of cut up rolls for everyone which was a nice touch and leaves you yearning for more. Since it was our first time we basically ordered almost everything from the happy hour menu and maybe a couple of things from the regular menu. My favorites were the Walu Walu, mache cure, ham and egg, crunchy spicy tuna roll, and the fried sweet potato and onion rings.
