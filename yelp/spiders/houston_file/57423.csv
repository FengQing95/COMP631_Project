Kata Robata////This sushi roll was so light and fresh! I love the sweetness from the mango and it's smooth texture. It really added a different and deeper layer of flavors for the roll because the tuna had a nice spice to it, and the tenderness of the salmon added a different texture. The tobiko was savory and added a nice little crunch.
