Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Both were very good but the best part were the pulled pork hush puppies with a mustard to die for!! That was truly the best part of the meal.  We didn't drink but we definitely want to go back to try a cocktail sometime.  I think that the music is a little too loud, even in the back, to have a conversation, so I'm not sure it will be a regular spot for us.  I think the restaurant is really pretty and hip, just wish it was easier to dine there.
