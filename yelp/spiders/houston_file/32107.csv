Local Foods////There was a long line to order, but the line moved quickly and fortunately by the time we ordered, we were able to snag a table as it was being cleaned! I ordered the smoked salmon on a poppy seed bagel and had the gazpacho for my side. I loved the gazpacho! It was very refreshing, and different from others I've had in the past. The cucumber and watermelon favors went very well together and perfect for that humid day! The smoked salmon was also tasty, it wasn't too salty and the spread gave it a slight sweet taste as well.
