JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////staff was somewhat helpful, i needed to wave them down multiple times for assistance. The food was so great! loved the multiple flavors of the soup and energy of the workers prepping it all for us. Appreciated the openness of the restaurant and its customers, unique food and setting. :)
