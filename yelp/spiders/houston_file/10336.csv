JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jeff - Thanks for the great review. I have to say, your descriptions are pretty spot-on, and hopefully our corporate R&D department will offer a tsukemen-style ramen. Unfortunately, the unit price of bok choy is much higher than other vegetables such as bean sprouts or green onions. And while its retail price does fluctuate based on availability and demand, we still must charge a fixed price according to our menu. But if you ever feel like a serving portion is too little for what you've paid, please notify your server who will ask the manager to help make things right by you. Our top priority is for every customer who leaves our establishment to walk out happy. Thanks again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
