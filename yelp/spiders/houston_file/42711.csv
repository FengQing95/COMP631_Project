Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here around 4PM on a weekday, so I did not have any problems with parking.  Since it was my first time here, I asked one of the workers to give some recommendations on drinks.  She told me that she didn't drink coffee (Umm...but why is you working in a coffee shop?)  I ended up getting a caramel latte & a chocolate-chip cookie.  The total was about $9, which is pretty expensive.  My latte was average, but the cookie was delicious!
