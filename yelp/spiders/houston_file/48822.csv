Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't have much positive to say. There were two more senior servers, who weren't ours, but seemed jolly and like they do a good job. That's literally the only positive I can muster, and it wasn't even related to us. Despite being blocks from my home, I have no intention of trying this place again!!
