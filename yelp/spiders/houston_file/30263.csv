The Pit Room////The brisket is just ok, the ribs are just ok, and the pulled pork is a little mushy. The sides are ok and the service is great. It's just a mad house inside when there are a ton of people. I had to yell my order over the counter and didn't want to ask too many questions about the menu cause I didn't want to hold up the line. If someone catered with The Pit Room then I'm good with eating it, am I going back to get it on my own? Probably not.
