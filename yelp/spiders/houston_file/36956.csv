Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the totchos and they didn't even tell me the tator tots were not available, instead they substituted fries and brought it out. When asked, they said they didn't have any tator tots and that we are lucky because we got their secret menu. This is after I had already placed an order of Bosscat fries. My entire dish was basically all potatoes.
