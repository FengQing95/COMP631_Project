JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regardless, our fare is never going to be all things to all people, including the layout of our restaurant. For every 10 Yelp review we receive praising our community tables, we average one or two negative reviews such as yours. Unfortunately, as a franchise concept, we are beholden to how our restaurant is designed, all the way down to the types of spoons and bowls we are allowed to use.
