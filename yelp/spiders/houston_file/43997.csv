Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////According to the guy behind the counter, croissants used to run out around 9 am, but recently, it's been more like 1pm (Info courtesy of a husband who can interact with humans). So I look forward to my next visit when I can get my hands on these croissants everyone is talking about.
