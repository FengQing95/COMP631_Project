Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait is horrible. Service was okay. The food was great. I had the snooze classic with chorizo and instead of toast I had the Pineapple Upside-down pa cake. Yummy. I asked for a salsa for my eggs and the server gave me Yellowbird Sauce Serrano. She said it was her absolute favorite. Well, she was right!! I found it at whole foods and purchased 2 bottles.
