The Pit Room////Couple of Chicagoans visiting Houston checking out some barbecue places to eat, and we come across this gem! People were nice and friendly and very helpful in our menu choices. The brisket tacos were amazing, with a nice spicy kick and the sides, mac n cheese and potato salad, topped them off well. I'll be coming back on my next visit to Houston!
