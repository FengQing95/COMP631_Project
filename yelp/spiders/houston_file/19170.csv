Uchi////Other things worth mentioning: valet parking is complimentary and is located behind the restaurant. The edamame is not just steamed and salted but it's also grilled. Gives it a nice charry flavor. They've got different specials every night which accompanies their regular menu. Everything here is super fresh, and I'm typically not a dessert person, but don't skip this part of the meal here. If you're a peanut butter fan, try the peanut butter semifreddo. It'll knock your socks off.
