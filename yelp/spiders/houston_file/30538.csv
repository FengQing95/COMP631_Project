The Pit Room////My first barbecue when I arrived to Houston and I was disappointed.  The meat was too vinegary, the sides were awful and the bread was just plain white.  Who has ever heard of such things !! I like my barbecue sweet, the sides appealing and the bread with garlic and butter. I want to order from a menu and be served at the table.  This was not for me !
