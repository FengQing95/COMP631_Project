JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel like the ramen is a pretty pricey and the noodles texture taste a bit off to me, and the broth is just decent. You can definitely get the same/better quality ramen for a cheaper price at other locations, but I will go to jinyas for convenience. There are couple other shops nearby to go to after eating at this location too.
