Uchi////Uchi is the best, most innovative restaurant I ever been too. The food is incredible. I love sushi and Uchi infuses traditional rolls with new and exciting flavors. I was in a food coma after eating at Uchi. I would recommend this spot only for special occasions because it's expensive, but well worth it.
