Kata Robata////All that aside, I'm willing to give this place 5 stars because of the food and my desire to visit again.  Just take a look at the rating distribution and you'll see that most people can tell quality when it's in front of them.  You can't please everyone, but Kata seems to do a good job pleasing most of them.  Give it a try, but don't expect the meal to be cheap.
