JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's hard to hate on a comfort food like ramen, so let's start with the good. They offer a chicken broth and vegetarian broth options for those who don't like the flavor of tonkotsu (yes, I'm one of those people). Both times I ordered delivery through a third party app, the order was flawless and nothing was missing.
