Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Red velvet churros (3.5/5): talk about a hype dessert! Churros are one of my favorite desserts so I couldn't pass this one up. Think of your typical churro on steroids. The inside of the churro is stuffed with red velvet cake so these churros are a lot larger than your typical fare. Talk about presentation as well as the interior of the churro is blood red. The churros are served with a cookie butter dipping sauce which is a phenomenal choice. Props again for the dipping sauce!
