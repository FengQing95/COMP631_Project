Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First, I would like to start this review by stating that the customer experience at Bosscat was an A+. The relaxed ambience lived up to one of the reasons Bosscat has been on our list of restaurants for a while. The bar had a great selection and a very helpful bartender. Now the food. It was a big disappointment. We arrived around 4 pm during happy hour which runs from 3-6 pm and were informed that 2 out of the 5 items on the happy hour menu were not available. Out of 3 of the items that we ordered, 2 were average and would not order again (fried oysters and ahi wraps) and 1 was good and would consider ordering again (pickled veggies). We also ordered the Whiskey Brined Pork entree. The Polenta was flavorful but the pork chop was overly salty and over cooked. The amazing waiter apologized and asked for the kitchen to remake the entree. The second pork chop was nicely cooked but still overly salty. We determined the excessive salty flavor was from the brined. I can honestly say that when dinning at similarly rated/priced restaurants with brined pork, excessive salt has not been an issue.
