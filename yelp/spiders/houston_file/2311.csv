JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Fantastic little ramen bar. They are very casual and the service is very friendly and punctual. I've been twice so far and each time has been delicious. For drinks I've tried the Moscow mile and lychee mojito which were both tasty. We tried the fried brussels sprouts which were also a great starter. There's ramen sauce, spicy sauce, and gyoza sauce at the table to season your ramen to your liking but it comes to you simply delicious on its own.
