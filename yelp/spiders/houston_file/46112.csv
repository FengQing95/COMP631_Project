Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's been tough to find my "go-to bakery" spot in this city but the search is finally over! This place is devine! The cakes are not only beautiful, but they taste fabulous which is very uncommon. Those who have a sweet tooth know what I'm talking about. So far I've tried 3 of their cakes, their macaroons and chocolate chip cookie! All fantastic!
