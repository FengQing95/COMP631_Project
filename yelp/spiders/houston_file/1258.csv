JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Miso D. - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your dining experience at JINYA. I spoke to our server Alex, who, unfortunately, has no recollection of serving you. Can you provide a description of your server so that I might speak to them about neglecting to greet you within one minute of your sitting down? That is a basic requirement we set for each server, but unfortunately they miss the mark sometimes due to time mismanagement or miscommunication.
