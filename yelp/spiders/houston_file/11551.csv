JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya lived up to all the hype I've been hearing. I went there for lunch & luckily was sat right away (I've heard they sometimes have massive waits). Our server was really nice & super helpful in assisting us with our selections. I finished off lunch with dessert (Mochi) that was honestly better than any other I've had. You have to try it!
