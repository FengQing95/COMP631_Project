The Pit Room////Def one of the best BBQ place in Houston! It's even better than Killens and it's a lot cheaper. Briskets, pulled pork, and sausages are the best meats, juicy and tender! All of the sides are super good. Mac and cheese and elotes are my favorite. The place is rather small so it got packed pretty quick even during non peak times.
