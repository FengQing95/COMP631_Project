JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////While busy and loud normally aren't my thing, this restaurant definitely became a must anytime in in the area. The spicy tonkatsu was very rich, and filling. The chicken ramen was nice, and a light classic. Even though it was so busy the night I visited, our food didn't take long at all, which was also because the staff is helpful. It's more than worth a small wait.
