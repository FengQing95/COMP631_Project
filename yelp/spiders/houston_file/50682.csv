Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////887 reviews and nearly all positive? We had to try this place for Sunday Brunch. We arrived close to 1p. The wait time is ridiculous. About an hour and 15 minutes for four people. The place is not spacious so the long wait line makes complete sense. You will hurdle with complete strangers, shoulder to shoulder, in a small corner near the coffee refill station. Yes the waiting "area" is right in front of the coffee refill station so you will have people coming in and out. No seating area to wait. Either hurdle like sardines in the corner or wait outside.
