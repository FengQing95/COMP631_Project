Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Large cold barn feel immediate upon entrance. Not greeted by receptionists upon entrance although two were standing there. Nor was I greeted farewell as I departed although two were standing there. Ordered an old fashion with angel's envy (top of the line). Small portion served with no cherry (which is a special part of this drink) and I think a lemon peel rather than the usual orange peel. It was horrible. I asked the bartender about the missing cherry and he said that old fashions do not come with cherries. Really,  well then a lot of bartenders are out there getting it wrong. I also ordered the small cornbread cakes thinking they would be served hot with butter.  Well, they tasted like cold cookies served with a thick hard cold red colored paste. Gross..!!!
