Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////EXCELLENT baked goods. I honestly was quite excited when I looked upon the myriad amount of well-prepared pastries. I had the ones listed below but the show stopper was probably the German sounding one with the weird shape (so basically the not-pistachio one). Super soft and flaky with a hard caramel shell on one side. I've never had anything like it but it strangely reminded me of baklava for some reason. Absolutely delicious.
