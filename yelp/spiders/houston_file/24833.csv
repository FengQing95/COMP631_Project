Uchi////Wow, what an amazing place! I am not even a big fan of sushi and I still loved it. My wife and I came here for happy hour and a long line was already forming before the place even opened. We got seats right at the sushi bar so we could watch the chefs in action. I think we ended up getting one of everything on the happy hour menu. I tried out the Takara nigori cold sake which was great. My favorites were the spicy crunchy tuna, machi cure, social pork, and the walu tempura. For dessert, we got the fried milk which was delicious. Even if you don't like sushi, def check this place out.
