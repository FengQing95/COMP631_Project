Snooze, an A.M. Eatery//// I loved Juan's Breakfast Tacos. It wasn't unique in its flavors..just a really good breakfast taco. The ingredients just taste really fresh. I've also tried the Sweet Potato Pancakes, Blueberry Danish Pancakes, Blackberry (pancake of the day) Pancakes. My favorite was the Blueberry Danish because it tasted like a muffin/cake!
