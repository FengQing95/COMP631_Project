Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Oh Common Bond how you make me so happy! Favorite place to go to when I'm down because their chocolate chip walnut cookies will make my frown turn upside down! Love love this bakery! Everyone working there is always so nice and helpful. It does get busy, but it's because how good everything is! The atmostphere is very open and relaxed making it the perfect place to meet up some friends!
