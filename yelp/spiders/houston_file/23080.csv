Uchi////I came to Uchi for my birthday dinner while I was in Houston this past weekend... To say that it was a disappointing dinner would be an understatement. I don't know if I came on an off night or if I had ordered wrong or what happened but the food was beyond underwhelming, the service was mediocre at best and I left the restaurant wondering if I ate at the same restaurant as all of these people who wrote such awesome reviews about Uchi.
