Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Initially, I felt invited and welcome to be in Common Bond. Hence the, " I am glad I am here" note typed on their napkins, which they are actually popular for. Tall ceilings,open windows,and a pretty roomy space for roughly 65 people makes up the caf√© (don't worry, there is outside seating).The only con I could find about this place is that it is surrounded by many popular small businesses, so it would be a challenge to try and find some peace and quiet if you're intention is to get some studying done without headphones, lol.
