Kata Robata////Fois gras sushi was buttery and delicious take on sushi.  The wait staff we had was super knowledgeable and let us try a lot of different sake's until we figured out what we liked.  I had no idea there was filtered (clear), unfiltered(cloudy), warm, cold, etc. that went into different sakes.  After several tastings later, I finally found one I enjoyed.
