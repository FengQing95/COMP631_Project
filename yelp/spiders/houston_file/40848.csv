Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for my birthday dinner and was severely disappointed. We had reservations and when we arrived we were seated promptly. Appx 15 mins later we had our order taken. It took over an hour for the food to even come out. I'm assuming it had to do something with the large party that was happening in the back, but that's still no excuse for the long wait. The food wasn't anything special either, it's nothing I'd come back for. This is more like a come after work and grab a couple drinks type of place vs a sit down dining option
