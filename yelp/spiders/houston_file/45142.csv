Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking was confusing since I drove by it and didn't see that they had a lot on the other side so I parked at Agora thankfully they didn't tow me. So as I was walking there I could already smell the coffee which was so fragrant and delicious. I got the caramel latte, cupcake and chocolate walnut cookie. When I first got in line I was overwhelmed by how this place works. This is a total hippie town cafe by the way like long beards people walking all over the streets with hipster clothes, camera, bikes, and urban outfitters clothing. It might be a turn off to some but it was like watching a really cool scene to me. I liked my food and the variety of breads they have there. Amazon will also pick up your food and deliver it to you for free if you are a prime member. Good coffee and pastries but pricey
