Uchi////Came here with my boyfriend and another friend to try their omakase. We'd heard from people that Uchi was supposed to be one of the best sushi places in Houston, and I'll be honest, if this is the best that Houston has to offer, then I'm high-tailing it back to California for my sushi fixes. For a similar price, you can get an infinitely better experience.
