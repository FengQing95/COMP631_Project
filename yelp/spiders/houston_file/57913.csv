Kata Robata////The bento boxes we ordered for lunch were eh. The ramen was consistently good but I would be extremely concerned if they messed that up. Overall I still love Kata and will continue to give it another try but the last 3 times have really been different. Hopefully they were exceptions to the usual good food and service.
