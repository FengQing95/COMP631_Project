Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Interesting place here. We came here because we wanted something sweet and weren't ready to go back to our hotel yet. Where I live, there aren't bakeries like this, so some of the pastries and sweets were new to me. Guy behind the counter was not a fan of all the questions my wife and I were asking. I would post what he recommended, but I don't remember what it was called. The macaroons were good, but seemed over priced, but maybe $2.25 is normal.
