JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I come here all the time and I truly never get tired of it. The broth is super rich and packed with flavor, the noodles are just the right texture, and the service is attentive. I get something different everything, but my favorite is still the Spicy Tonkatsu ramen. If you're looking for somewhere semi-casual to eat with friends, this place is perfect.
