Baby Barnaby's////Twice now I've been the very first customer when they open and to say that having Scott be my first interaction of the day makes my whole mood/outlook on the day positive and hopeful is a vast understatement. Starbucks used to teach this in their trainings "baristas may be the first people customers talk to in the morning....". And while they have tapped into something important and true, Scott nails this. He truly kicks people's days off on the right foot. It's like having a good friend serve you who understands that, while friends, he is also still the server. That's a hard line to toe. But he always maintains the perfect balance.
