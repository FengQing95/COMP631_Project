Uchi////I must admit I used to very much enjoy this place.  After three bad experiences, I decided to give it one more chance.   Arrogance abounds here from the staff.  We waited an hour for an appetizer.  We were  served raw chicken.  The sushi that used to impress and move you, is mediocre at best now.  We asked for the check after having an empty glass of wine for twenty minutes and still did not get  any meaningful attention.  Our disappointment must have been readily apparent as we paid.  Instead of a sincere apology or a meaningful effort to make it right, we were offered a $25 gift certificate.   Needless to say, we will not be using it.  Uchi, it is over.  We are done with you.
