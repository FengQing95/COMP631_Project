Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Houston has a lot of good bakeries, but few great ones. Common Bond stands among them now. They've only been open a month or two, but in that time, they've gained some steam. There's always a line out the door, and it will take awhile to get through, but it is worth it!
