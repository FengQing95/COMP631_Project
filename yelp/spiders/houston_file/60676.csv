Baby Barnaby's////This was my first visit and I wanted breakfast so I went to Baby Barnaby's. I ordered the green eggs with spinach and artichokes. They were delicious and very flavorful! The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well! The chicken sausage was tasty too. I also ordered the lemon pancakes which were delicious. I can't wait to go back!
