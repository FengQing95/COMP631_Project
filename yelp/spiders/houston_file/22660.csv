Uchi////We were celebrating a new job. Uchi did so much to take care of us. We were brought not one, not two, but three dishes that were complimentary to help celebrate. Total value of the 3 dishes we were surprised with was probably $40-$45. We were blown away that we would be given these dishes as gifts because they were expensive. They were also excellent and delicious and really added to our experience here. I really couldn't believe a restaurant would be that generous. It was so nice and we were so appreciative. This is a wonderful place to celebrate something big.
