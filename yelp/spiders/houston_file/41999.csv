Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is the only place I can find bread/pastries in Houston that's comparable to what you'd find in Paris. I come here at least twice a week. It's great for breakfast, brunch (on weekends) or lunch/dinner. And it's also just a nice place to meet friends for coffee or a drink (really great prices on wine!). Plus the atmosphere is fantastic. All in all, you're missing out if you live in Houston and have not discovered this place.
