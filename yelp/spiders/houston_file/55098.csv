Kata Robata////Foie gras & duck noodles - foie gras was like eating straight butter made from an animal. Luckily, I like butter, and I like animals even more, so this was a winner for me. Duck breast was cold, limp, and undercooked and was pretty disappointing. The noodles also seemed undercooked and I found myself constantly trying to get pieces unstuck from my teeth. Also, it was like 5 bites.
