The Pit Room////How the heck did I forget to rate this place. My fam and I super enjoyed our meal here. We live about 30 mins from here. I joke you not... we were bidding on buying a 6 plex multi fam property... and decided to make our counter bid based on the fact it was near this restaurant and we would have a reason to come out this way and eat here hahhaa. Annnnddd offer accepted. So my partner and i will be frequenting this restaurant for the next four or so month on a regular basis.
