Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First of all, I have to admit that I am not a fan of carbs, but when it comes to pastries from CB, I will DEVOUR anything they have!  Not only are the pastries divine, their brunch and lunch are just as amazing. The chicken torta is extremely moist and it literally melts in your mouth.  It's a must!  The line is usually out the door but if you time it correctly, it's tolerable!  Don't leave without at least 2 chocolate chip walnut cookies! Bigger than your palm!
