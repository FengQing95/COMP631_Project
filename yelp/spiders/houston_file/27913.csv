The Pit Room////The best thing I had was the brisket taco. That was DELICIOUS. The ribs were good, though I wish they had a bit more flavor. Okra was delicious and I kept snacking on the onion bulbs. Mac and cheese was a bit watery. Might go back at least once...the staff were quick and attentive. Filled me up.
