Uchi////We misunderstood how Uchi Omakase works. Their omakase isn't the traditional omakase with a set price on a set number of dishes. It is all a-la-carte pricing based on whatever the chef gives you. That being said, unless you tell the chef to stop, he will keep dishing out food (unsure why it even says 10 courses on the menu). We were quite surprised at the bill when we were expecting $250 on the bill but saw a number closer to double. I called back a few days later, as they were busy that night, and mentioned that I thought the menu and chef were ambiguous on the pricing, and the manager was very understanding. Despite COVID-19 concerns just starting up back then (was around March), the manager listened and we came to an agreement that we were both happy with. She was very fair in her decision. With her handling of the situation, and the quality of the food, Uchi will now be a staple on our eating out list.
