Local Foods////Some of my favorite menu items are the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich with the homemade chips. I could eat this everyday and be completely happy. I also really like the Asian Chicken Salad for whenever I guilt myself into actually eating a salad. It's a salad that tastes good! Go figure! The Mintade (I think that's how you spell it) is made fresh everyday, so it tastes a little different each time you have it. I generally think this is pretty good! My friends though are in love with the Mintade.
