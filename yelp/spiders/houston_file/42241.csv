Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It is hard to find parking, and there will definitely be a line. Line isn't super fast, but it isn't terribly slow either. Basically you look at the menu while you are in line, so by the time you get up to the counter, you know what you want. Also there is a glass display of baked goodies and sweets that you pass by on your way to the counter, so you can pick out what you want.
