Kata Robata////Sat there for almost 30 minutes, waiters passed by about 20 times slow with no purpose didn't asked if we needed a server, first time here and never coming back. Sad really, people told me it was really good place but too bad I was starving and couldn't even order food. Only person who acknowledged us was the water guy who came right when we sat down. Left extremely disappointed.
