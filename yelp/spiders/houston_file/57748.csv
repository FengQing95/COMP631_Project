Kata Robata////My boyfriend and I stopped by for our anniversary dinner on our way home back to New Orleans from Austin. Made reservations for 6:30, got seated immediately and from then on we had probably one of the best dining experiences ever. Our server Anh was very friendly, knowledgeable and was a pleasure to interact with. Everyone was very helpful and made sure things went smoothly. As for the food.... omg let me just say... MUST GET: Kobe beef skewers, Yuzu marinated salmon sashimi, amberjack sashimi with foie gras, miso crusted bone marrow, miso Marinated black cod, otoro and Uni nigiri & green tea souffl√© cheesecake!!!!
