Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is AMAZING! I can't believe it is my first time coming here. It's a super cute spot, kind of limited seating but the food is phenomenal. I had a latte, biscuits and gravy, vegetarian quiche, tomato basil soup, fresh yogurt, and 3 of the desserts on the line. None of the items disappointed. I can't rave enough about it. I want to go back and buy one if the cakes! And the service was great, everyone was very friendly. I came here on recommendation from the kitchen manager Matt! Very nice, friendly guy!
