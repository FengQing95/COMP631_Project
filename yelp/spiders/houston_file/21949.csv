Uchi////What an amazing culinary experience.  I've eaten fantastic meals around the the us and internationally and this ranks right up there with them all.  We had the tasting menu and were blown away with the clever pairing of flavors.  What's more, their presentation was exquisite.  Go to this place and eat!  You'll be very glad you did.
