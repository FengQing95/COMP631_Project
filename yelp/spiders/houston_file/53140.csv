Kata Robata////I have been lucky to eat sushi prepared by Jiro in Tokyo, and this is the next best thing I've had in Houston.  I've yet to encounter a morsel from Chef Hori that I didn't love.  In fact, the two best meals I've had in this city were the result of Kata's tasting menu (omakase is the word).
