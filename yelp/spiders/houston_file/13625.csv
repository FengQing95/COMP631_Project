JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I come here a lot, because this is one of the few places that a bowl of ramen comes with decent toppings. Wait used to be so much more crazier than these days. Usually allows only small group of people unless they all decided to come at once. I got sat for party of two, on the ramen bar side.
