JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Brussel tempura was great, but I received chicken broth in Tonkotsu Assari. I questioned my palette so I tested broth from Jinya Tonkotsu Black which definitely was pork broth and differed from mine, called bartender and asked. She said that's not possible saying all black bowls are pork broths and red bowls are chicken broths. But I tasted nothing but chicken..
