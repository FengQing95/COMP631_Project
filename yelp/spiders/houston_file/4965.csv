JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great Ramen house. Good selection and attentive service Â by Daniel. Lots of optional ingredients to add to your ramen of choice. Busy at lunch much, recommend coming early (before 12). Place was packed when I left. Ordered the spicy chicken ramen (ordered it spicy on a scale of mild, spicy, hot, inferno). It wasn't that spicy, could have gone up a notch or two. Instead asked for some Togarashi from the server. They had it (a sure sign of an authentic Japanese place). Lots of different appetizers to try; I will definitely be back!
