Kata Robata////The food is great, and the atmosphere is excellent. We end up with a unhappy waitress. We would've enjoy the meal more if they assign us with a better server. No introduction or greeting, and takes forever for her to come back to our table each time. Finally, I hope the waitress with attitude have a lovely day!
