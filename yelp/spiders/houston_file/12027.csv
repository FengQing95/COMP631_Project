JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has a really great selection of different ramen. I tried the tonkatsu spicy. I added extra spice and garlic as well. I think the kale ramen is an interesting take, it tastes like regular noodles. We additionally tried some of their new appetizers such as the shrimp and crispy rice, it was okay. I think if you don't mind waiting, this place is pretty good.
