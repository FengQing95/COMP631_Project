Kata Robata////Loved the ambiance and how clean the restaurant is. My boyfriend and I came right before happy hour when the restaurant started to get busy. Service was good but a little slow probably because of how busy they got. My boyfriend and I ordered a lot of sashimi/sushi (salmon belly, toro, uni, ikura) and quality was GREAT! We also got the bone marrow which was AMAZING. The wagyu beef was also very delicious. If you're looking for good sushi with quality, come here!
