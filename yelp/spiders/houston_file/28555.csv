The Pit Room////The Pit Room was my first experience at a Texan barbecue restaurant and I was very pleased! When we arrived the line was out the door but it was so worth the wait. The macaroni and cheese was delicious and the beans had some kick to them. The brisket was amazing and the turkey was so juicy! We ordered a pound and a half of meat, two sausages and two pint sides for four and were stuffed at the end.
