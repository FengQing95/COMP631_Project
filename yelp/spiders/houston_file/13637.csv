JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Visited Jinya this past Saturday for a late night dinner.  At almost midnight, it was slammed packed.  This place is really, really small with very little space to maneuver so, waiting 25 minutes rubbing shoulders with strangers as people come and go wasn't the greatest experience.  Felt like a overcrowded elevator ride.  We were finally seated at the first available opening which was a group table.  There's pros and cons to group seating.  If you prefer more privacy or enjoy having more of a conversation with your party I would vote against it and wait for a table to become available.  Otherwise, it'll feel like you're having Thanksgiving dinner at the home of an acquaintance and you've just been seated next to and across from people you've never met; a bit awkward.  If you're looking for a quiet and romantic dinner, I'd skip this place.  Although beautifully dimly lit, between the loud conversations being had, the loud electronica music playing overhead, and the servers screaming "irasshai!" (Welcome in Japanese) every few minutes it was really loud, making it very difficult to hold a conversation at the group table.
