Local Foods//// The main problem is that the salad doesn't come with any dressing.  I thought maybe because I picked it up to-go that they had forgotten the dressing.  But no, the salsa verde listed on the menu IS the dressing.  And they only gave me a tiny little container of that.  I'm not really a fan of dressing-less salads.  Secondly, the menu says that the salad comes with "sprouts."  I took that to mean alfalfa sprouts; turns out it meant bean sprouts.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people would assume that a salad that comes with sprouts means alfalfa sprouts.  Thirdly, the salad was full of beets and I don't like beets; I actually loathe them.  I wish I had known.  I guess I should have asked which vegetables were included; the menu just says "market vegetables."  Fourthly, there were only like 3 little dots of goat cheese; they really skimped on the cheese.  Overall, I really disliked this salad.  I'm still giving this place 4 stars because their sandwiches and desserts rock.  I probably just won't bother with getting a salad ever again.
