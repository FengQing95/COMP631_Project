Kata Robata////This has become one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go to. I love the fresh quality sushi here. I came on 5/5/21, Wednesday, at 1pm to come celebrate a friend's recent engagement. She has never been here and thoroughly enjoyed her meal, especially the Texas Kobe beef which is just a fan favorite with its buttery meat quality. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. There's hardly any chewing needed. I also really love their salmon! The five different types of seaweed salad was unique but it's probably not something I would order again, some of it was a little bland. Lastly their green tea souffl√© cheesecake was subtly sweet and a great way to round out our meal, I'll definitely order that again. The service and atmosphere is always so nice and great for any occasion. I look forward to trying many more of their dishes.
