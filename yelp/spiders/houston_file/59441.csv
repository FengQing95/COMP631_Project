Baby Barnaby's////New favorite brunch spot in Houston! Be prepared to wait on a weekend but the clipboard system is efficient and there are a couple of benches and complimentary water in the waiting area. Indoor and outdoor seating is available, with the inside being small but quaint. Now onto the food.. the green eggs are delicious! I didn't have a single complaint about anything on the plate, everything was cooked to perfection from the eggs to the sausage and potatoes, which were plentiful. My table also ordered the banana walnut pancakes to share, which were just as yummy! Bananas were inside the batter so you get a little taste of it with every bite. The service was quick even though all tables were full. Only downside is parking, which can be found on nearby streets. Five stars in my book!
