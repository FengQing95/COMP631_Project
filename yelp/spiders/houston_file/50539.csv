Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The ONLY downside to this place is there's not a waiting area so when it's busy and there's a million people waiting everyone is crowding around the tables at the front of the restaurant, which sucks for the people sitting there, so just hope that you get seated toward the back like we did. There's sort of an outside area to wait but when it's 100 degrees outside in July no one wants to stand out there.
