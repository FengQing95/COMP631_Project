Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries are incredible, everything is so fresh and delicious. The bread is amazing, we took some to go. And the coffee was excellent, they have oat milk, which is the only dairy free option that froths beautifully in a cappuccino or latte. We had a little snag and they went so far out of their way to make everything perfect. This place is now in our family's favorite list!
