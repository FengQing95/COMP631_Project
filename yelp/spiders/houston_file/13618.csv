JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Sprouting Up Ramen (thick noodles, Pork & Chicken broth, chashu, bean sprouts, green onion, egg, crispy brussels sprouts). The ingredients were interesting - not your regular ramen bowl stuff. Although they mentioned that their broth is their specialty, I personally liked their noodles better. If you like thick noodles, this will be your love. The broth was good, but just kinda average. I like broths that are thick, rich, and heavy. This one was just a basic one that was like "one size fits all" for all tastes. The egg was another highlight - it was cooked perfectly - a tiny bit runny, but all around warm. I hate ramen restaurants that overcook the egg, or serve it to you cold. Yucks. But the egg at this place was perfect! I also added in corn and dried nori - each $1 extra, but totally worth it because they gave a lot of corn (like 1/4 cup!) and 3-4 sheets of nori. Awesome!
