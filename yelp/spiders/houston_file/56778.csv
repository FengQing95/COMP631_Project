Kata Robata////2) Amazing food-I was a bit hesitant to come because of all the hype. Especially given Houston's lively food scene, it's easy for restaurants' brand to overshadow the actual quality of the food. But Kata Robata's wide variety of dishes and deep, complex flavors held up and surpassed reviews. We ordered the homemade shumai, grilled octopus, spicy tuna and Rising Sun signature rolls, lobster mac and cheese, seaweed salad, blackened cod, and green tea cake. I know--it sounds like a lot, but each dish had its own flavor profile that showcased simple ingredients. No heavy sauces, under seasoning, or cluttered plating. The chefs carefully handled each component of the dish, and used lighter (usually ponzu-based) sauces to cut heavier courses.
