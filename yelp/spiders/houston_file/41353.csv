Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////With all the buzz, T was time to try Common Bond. It fully lived up to its advance billing. I went for a mid-afternoon snack, and had a kugelhopf and a salted caramel macaron. They both were tremendously good and filled the bill. Common Bond's premium product has its price, but it is worth every penny.
