Uchi////Our waitress was very nice and the food was fine but because they gave our food to all the tables around us, the experience sucked. We sat there watching other tables that came an hour after us get food before we did. Â We ended up having to wait forever to finally get most of the things we ordered and things that were suppose to be complimentary showed up on the bill as well as items we didn't even receive.
