JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ami - Thanks so much for the 5-star review! We're very glad you enjoyed our ramen. And for understanding about our extended wait times during peak hours. Hopefully by this time next year when we have more locations open, the Midtown crowd might be somewhat dissipated. Regardless, thanks for coming through!
