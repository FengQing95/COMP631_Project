Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was not impressed by the absurd polish of the place, nor the faux chic atmosphere. It took forever for someone to attend to me, ask me for my order.  Then, when my I got my croissant, I realized it was day-old stale, and the latte I ordered smelled not right, with a hint of old milk, and burnt.  Wow!  For a place with such high prices with very limited wifi at certain hours, and with so many other great options in town, why come back? I will not come back here again. Also, parking is difficult!  Do not park here after 7pm as they will tow you!!  Common Bond is more like Common Bondage -- don't get caught up in the hype for nothing.
