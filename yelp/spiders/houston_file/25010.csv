Uchi////I would recommend sitting by the bar, you get to see the chef in action. The Uchi chefs are very talented with the way they cut the sashimi or garnishing each dish. You can ask the hostess to sit you by the bar. One thing that is a must-try here is the fried milk. It's their specialty dessert. I love every bit of it and it was the perfect way to end dinner.
