The Pit Room////So first off we rarely ever have Barbecue, but this weekend we decided to give it try. We used yelp and found this location to not be too far (5 minutes) and it looked really good. And....it is as advertised! I got the three meats, Chicken, Brisket and Sausage with my sides being the elote and charro beans. Everything was very food. One of the best things about all this was their sauce was very good, my wife, who is not a BBQ person, really enjoyed her meal as well.
