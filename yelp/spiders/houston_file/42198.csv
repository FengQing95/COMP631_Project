Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There are so many things to love about CB.  The coffee and pastries are as good as it gets.  As others have said, it's crowded and parking is a nightmare, but it's really good.  The extended hours are a big plus.  The service was off on our last visit (items left off the order, something else delivered that we didn't order and questioned by the server when we said it wasn't ours, repeated requests), but it was spring break and the place was packed with kids so we'll try again.
