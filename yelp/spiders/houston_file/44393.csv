Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The oatmeal cream pie is two chewy oatmeal cookies (no raisins) with a vanilla bean cream cheese filling. It's like a cookie cake that tastes most similar to a spice cake. I don't think I can eat the oatmeal cookie in one go because the icing is pretty sweet for me, but maybe shared between two people or accompanied with some strong coffee.
