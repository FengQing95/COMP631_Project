Kata Robata////Once inside, the setting is nice, loud, fun and cozy, while food was outstanding but grossly overpriced - not just in principle but for the smallish portion sizes. Getting in was outright difficult. Making a reservation ahead of time was impossible, and we were put on the 30-minute waiting list. They were supposed to call/text us when our table was ready, but no one did. We just walked back in after about 40 minutes, and were told we didn't answer; how about leaving a message or using text like the grownups do? After that, the entire experience inside was less than perfect. Our waiter did a great job, although some of the dishes on the menu were unavailable, which added oil to "the fire" - not just unavailable but first they took the order and then came back 5 minutes later to advised that one of the dishes was unavailable. Total price for a dinner for two was about $170, which was quite grotesque at about 750 calories per person (for those who don't count, this is definitely smallish - think the equivalent of a small salad, a small soup and a small sandwich); granted, this dinner included two small bottles of sake that we normally buy at Specs for under $10 a bottle, and STILL this was too expensive, especially for this questionable service level.
