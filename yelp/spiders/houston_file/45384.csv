Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my last day in Houston was a pastry filled one and my consumption of pastries started at Common Bond Cafe. My friends told me it was a must to go here before I left and so we decided 9am on Saturday morning. Gosh, there was a line already and the place wasn't even open yet! Good thing my friend was there at 8:45am and was about 15-20 people away from the front.
