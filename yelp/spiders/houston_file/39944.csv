Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Decided to check out their brunch to see if the stars were accurate. Drinks- The old fashioneds were delicious. I always judge based on the orange slice (has it been flamed), the quality of the muddling, cherries and of course the whiskey. After 3 old fashioneds my counterpart confirmed they were indeed excellently crafted.
