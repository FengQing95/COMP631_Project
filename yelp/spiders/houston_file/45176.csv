Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I woke up with a craving for their coffee, let's start there. The aroma is mouth watering and the macaroons line up for ig perfection. Although the line can be intimidating, the staff keeps it moving smoothly. The tables are cleaned regularly so you are not sitting around other people's crumbs, which is the case a lot of the times at other bakeries. Contemplating getting up now to get a latte.
