Local Foods////PRAISE THE PRETZEL BUN. I absolutely loooove Local Foods. Everything they have on the menu is top notch and super healthy sounding. I've tried a variety of their sandwiches - crunchy chicken, smoked salmon, egg truffle, gulf crab - and every single one has been delicious. The only setback is actually finishing both halves of the gigantic sandwich and the 2 sides of your choice it comes with. Each sandwich is stuffed to the brim and can easily be shared with someone. For the sides, I'm personally a fan of the acorn squash and the couscous, but there's a little something for everyone and they're very generous in letting you sample them all! As stated in the first sentence, you can ask them to switch out the bread to anything, and the pretzel bun goes with everything and is pure happiness. Perfect for lunch (and dinner!) Local Foods is always a safe bet for a good meal.
