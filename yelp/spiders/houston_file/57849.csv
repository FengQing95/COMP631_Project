Kata Robata////It was our first time and can't believe we waited so long to finally dine here. Great to see they are enforcing social distancing and proper hygiene to allow guests to dine safely. The food was amazing. Bone marrow, salmon carpaccio, foie gras, and numerous Japanese nigiri. We'll definitely dine here again!
