JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Would be a 5 but service was lacking. First was the waitress who recommended a way too spicy level. My BF thought it was unbearable to the point that he couldn't even eat it. It hurt the back of my throat if I drank too much. It also took 30 mins to get our food...considering we were there at 3 pm it should not have been that slow. Waitress also did not come and check if everything was good. Like I said, it was not busy.
