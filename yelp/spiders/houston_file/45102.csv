Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Significantly underpaid and naive employees are being taken advantage of when working here, their bosses are money hungry and do not care about the safety of you nor their own employees. they are also extremely unprofessional when addressing concerns, a former employee was fired with little to no reason as there was a disagreement that MASKS should be worn for employees and unprofessionalism can be see in their Instagram comments. this is a disgusting company and there are many others you can support that fairly pay their workers. mind you they were previously paid a dollar and hour and recently was ONLY RAISED A DOLLAR but no hazard pay. horrific, would prefer to give 0 stars
