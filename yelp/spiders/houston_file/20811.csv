Uchi////For maki, the Zero Sen roll has long been one of my favorites. It's yellowtail with avocado, shallot, cilantro, tobiko, yuzu; wonderfully simple, fantastically delicious. The Biendo used to come deconstructed, but at the Houston location it's a fully made roll. With frozen grapes and a spring roll, it tends to surprise in a good way. My dining compatriots loved the Ham & Eggs.
