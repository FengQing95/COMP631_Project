JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I stand by our hostess and my co-manager, Wynne, who said they did not treat you or anyone else in your party any differently than the several hundred guests who visited us that night. I am sorry for your misunderstanding. And while I doubt we'll ever find common ground here, I still sincerely invite you to come back to JINYA. If you do, please ask for me personally. I will make sure you receive the dining experience that the many reviews here describe.
