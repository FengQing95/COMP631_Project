JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel strongly about this because our reputation is all that we have at JINYA. And more than 100 people's livelihoods depend on that reputation. We work hard, and we always try to do the right thing for our customers. So we would have been more than happy to offer you a different bowl or another option that might have better suited your taste buds.
