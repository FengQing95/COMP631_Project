JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've had the same few waiters and waitresses and they are all so awesome. Everyone is very attentive to their respective customers and no glass of water shall be empty for long! Even though we were there close to closing (which I now feel horrible for since it was 100% my fault for eating so so slow), everyone is very respectful and nice. A great experience with service!
