JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The next day I ordered the same thing but not spicy.  I really wanted to try the broth for what it was.  Like I said, the broth by itself is tasty, but THAT BLACK GARLIC OIL THO! I repeated my mistake by not mixing it well, but this time I ordered an extra garlic oil for the bottom of my bowl.  worth it! I just got carried away though with my heavy hand.  You don't need that much garlic oil, you don't want to mask the original tonkatsu broth taste.  Ohhh and I almost forgot to talk about the actually pork chashu....the meat was SO DAMN tender. It was like butter and it tasted delicious.
