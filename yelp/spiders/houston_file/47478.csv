Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu is so extensive that there are still many more items that I need to go back and try. You would think the lines would have died down a bit by now, but that is not the case. I've generally arrived around 10:30 on Fridays and the wait time is still about 30 minutes. Which beats waiting 1.5-2 hours on the weekends. But nonetheless, I'm still happy Houston has this as another brunch option!
