Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I thought I couldn't go wrong with a turkey club sandwich but boy was I wrong. Now the sandwich itself looked so delicious. Toasted white bread with Turkey, thick bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. It may have had cheese. I don't remember. Maybe not since I'm not a cheese fanatic. Oh, it also had thick slices of delicious avocado.
