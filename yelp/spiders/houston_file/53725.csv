Kata Robata////I met a friend for lunch here on a weekday during my lunch break.  Though I don't think speedy service is ideal for an upscale dinner (nicer to enjoy the company and food at a slightly slower pace), it is nicer to keep things moving during lunch when people have to get back to work.  As you can probably guess already, this was some of the slowest service I've seen at a place for lunch.  Even though we were the first people in the restaurant when it opened at 11:30, several parties (that were larger than ours) received their food well before us, which ended up stretching the meal out for an hour plus.
