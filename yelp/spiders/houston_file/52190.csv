Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my favorite menu go-to items is the Benny Duo (5/5). I'm indecisive and I can't decide on just one of the eggs Benedict dishes, so this allows me to pick 2! I get the Chili Verde Benedict + Benny Goodman. Also one of my favorite things about this dish? It comes with a large pile of hash browns that I just LOVE. Pro trip: ask for hot sauce to eat with this dish too for a nice little kick and extra flavor!
