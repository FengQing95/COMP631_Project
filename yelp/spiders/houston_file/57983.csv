Kata Robata////Always a solid option in the area for robata, sushi, cocktails, noodles, and more. Â We had a variety of dishes, but I'll recommend the lobster and crab ramen. Rich and flavorful with chunks of lobster and crabmeat, I loved this dish so much I order plain noodles to go and boxed up leftover broth to eat for lunch at home the next day.
