Kata Robata////Wonderful value at happy hour-over at 6:30, not 7 like many other restaurants.  Go at any hour though.  Pork buns are heaven and liked the fried eel and rodeo rolls quite a bit.  Also tuna tar tar.  Wine list would benefit from a few more selections so stick with the beer.  Lovely atmosphere. Will be back.
