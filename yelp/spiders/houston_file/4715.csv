JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place offers one vegetarian option (which was really nice of them even though we're not their target customers) Â and I must say that the portion was well worth the price. The broth was soy sauce based so it wasn't anything that I would deemed amazing. Overall,the noodles were decent but not something that I would come back for or crave it because the broth is basically watered down soy sauce.
