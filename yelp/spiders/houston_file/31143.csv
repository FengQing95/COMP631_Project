Local Foods////saw the website and was drawn in by the concept but once i finally got there i realized that it was: overrated hype, not much variety, flavor was lacking, and so packed with soccer moms and self-righteous yuppies at lunch i felt agoraphobic. Â it's like they tried to throw together a Clyde Common in Houston and too many things were lost in translation.
