Uchi////Right off the bat, our server was extremely sweet and helpful. She explained how to order, made excellent recommendations, and was very enthusiastic about everything once she found out it was our first time there. Everything we ordered, including the drinks, lived up to all the hype. I was especially impressed by how fresh/delicious the sashimi was! They also don't overdo the seasoning of raw fish, or put soy sauce on the table to dip unseasoned fish, like most other sushi places.
