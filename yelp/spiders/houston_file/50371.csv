Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Annoyance 3 - They have complimentary coffee at the front for those who are waiting. Super nice right? Well not when there is NO COFFEE and NO SUGAR and no STIRRERS! Just gobs of cups and some cream. I had to ask several times about the coffee and they said it was being made. Okay, by now they should know how popular this place is and have a distinct job for a coffee maker. The hostess did grab a cup for me and when behind the bar and to get me a some coffee. Super nice, but what about everyone else that doesn't ask? Â  Make the customers happy if we are waiting so stinking long. Finally coffee was brought out, but still no sugar or stirrers. Just cracked me up.
