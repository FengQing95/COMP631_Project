Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Did not have the TX whiskey I asked for from their menu.  Said they "ran out".  Asked for beer suggestions but wasn't offered a taster for any of them when I asked about Texas Craft beer.  The beer I ordered from the servers suggestion was ok but if I had been offered a sample first I would not have chosen it on my own.
