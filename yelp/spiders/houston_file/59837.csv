Baby Barnaby's////My wife and I were in town for her birthday weekend. We wanted brunch before leaving back to SA. Long wait, maybe an hour or so. Boy was it worth the wait! They fresh squeeze their orange juice. Must try! Green eggs, must try! Yummm!! We also ordered a banana walnut pancake and it was really good as well. Service was a tad slow but the food and atmosphere kept this place at 5 stars. Highly recommend!
