Baby Barnaby's////I had already tried Barnaby's but had been dying to try Baby B's and was finally able to today. Very similar to the Barnaby's on W Gray. For being such a tiny place with only 2 waiters, they were still super friendly, efficient and food was just as I remembered. Finally tried the green eggs, which have spinache and artichoke (not green food coloring, as I assumed) and were very yummy. I still think they have the best potatoes in the city, so addicting. Portions are huge and the price is small!
