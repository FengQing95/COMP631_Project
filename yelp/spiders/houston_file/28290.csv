The Pit Room////I love BBQ and for that reason it's usually hard to try new places. I also am a competition BBQ cook which makes it even harder to eat " restaurant BBQ". With all that being said, give these guys a shot. Their smoked turkey was hands down my favorite, the brisket was very moist, tender and flavorful. Ribs were good and tender as well, my only knock on the place was the venison sausage. It's not that the sausage was bad, it's that I believe it was leftover from the weekend and had been reheated, it was sooooooo dry! All that being said next to Roegels, this is my favorite joint in town. Authentic Texas BBQ with no fancy fluff!!
