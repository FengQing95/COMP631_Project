Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Im torn but in all fairness i think its me. This place is nice, i love the atmosphere. Its laid back and relax. Looks like an really family friendly place to go and enjoy. I ordered a boss lady cocktail, my friend and i shared the short ribs and we both had a desset. The cocktail was good i would definitely come back during happy hour to try some other drinks.  The short ribs were a tad salty for me. The desserts were also not my cup of tea.  The manderian cake tasted like s pancake and the red velvet churros were dry. Again,  my personal preference so it may taste different to someone else. I would cone back for the drinks but i would pass on the food.
