Uchi////I went to Uchi recently for my 21st birthday for dinner. I had reservation so I did not have to wait long and I was seated immediately. I had the chef's tasting omakase which consist of the ten course meal. For starter we had the house salad and oh my god, it was the best salad I ever had in my life. If salads always taste like that then I would be one very happy girl. The vegetables were fresh and the daikon added a perfect crunch with every bite. Now, that star of the show was definitely the white sauce at the bottom with thai pesto sauce. It was a party in my mouth with the perfect balance of every flavor out there. I had a little bit of spice, sweetness, sourness, and savory. The sushi were amazing. I like that some of them already had a little bit of sashimi in the fish and it was not too overwhelming. The texture of the fish was like silk and you can tell how fresh it was the minute you bite into it. I had the knife jaw, Spanish mackerel, and snapper nigiri. There was also the Yellowtail with yuka chips, asian pear, and raisins. I was a little skeptical about this combination at first but the chef always somehow manage to make everything works. There's also salmon ceviche with cherry tomatoes, and raisins. There's a little spice to this salmon but then it mellow out and was not overpowering at all. I loveeee the oak grilled escolar. I grew up eating many type of fish and this dish did not disspoint. It was very soft and flakey. The sauce added the perfect amount of flavor. The octopus was so smokey and so well grilled. I love the crunch from this dish. One of the dish had a beef tendon chip and oh my god, you have to get this. It was amazing. I never had anything like it before. There were so much flavor! For dessert, I had the fried milk and the pumpkin spice funnel cake. They were both delicious! The fried milk was a very unexpected dish for me. Who knew that milk can be fried but it worked. Overall, I definitely would come back to Uchi if I want something that would never fail me. Love this place!
