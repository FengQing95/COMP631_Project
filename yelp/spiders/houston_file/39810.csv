Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had the short rib chiliquiles.  They were great as well, and served in a little cast iron skillet.  It seemed small at first but was plenty filling.  The short rib itself was tender and delicious, the chips were perfect, the sauce was great, with some sour cream and an egg on top.  Perfect breakfast
