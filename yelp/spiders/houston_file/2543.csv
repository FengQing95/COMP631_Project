JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the cha cha cha and it was amazing! I added nori. Portion didn't look big but it was very filling! The service was always very attentive. Our waters were always full. Definitely a great Ramen shop. Wanted to try their pork belly bao but for $4 a price I thought it was a little too pricey.
