The Pit Room////Wow! First time trying Texas BBQ and it did not disappoint. Got the two meat dinner with brisket, pork ribs, elote and Mac n' cheese. The brisket damn near broke apart like butter. I may just get a whole order of that next time! Came right at 6 and right before the dinner rush. I was able to order and get my food within 10 minutes, and as I sat down I saw the line had already piled up and wrapped around all the way outside. A must go for bbq lovers!
