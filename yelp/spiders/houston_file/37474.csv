Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Nice spot for brunch or dinner, however, not particularity intimate. The restaurant is pretty loud during busy hours, but sometimes that's a vibe in itself. Food is tasty, though a bit overpriced. Cocktails and whiskey selection are great. The food is New American meets comfort food and the decor/ambience is sports bar meets contrived yet tasteful industrial (because it's in a shopping center), but once you're inside, you kind of forget Westheimer and Highland Village are close neighbors. Would recommend for groups or folks looking for a spirited outing.
