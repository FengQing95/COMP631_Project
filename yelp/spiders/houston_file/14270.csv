JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So here are my thoughts. Food was beautiful. Always order the extra noodles. Prices were VERY reasonable. If I didn't have ramen from NYC, SF, ATL, Seattle, and a host of others cities to compare to, I'd probably give this spot a higher rating, but unfortunately I have. I give it a solid 3 stars mostly because when I come back to Houston, I don't feel a strong desire to go back as I do with my other favorite ramen spots. Sorry. I want to love it and next time I'm in town, I'll try a different bowl because it's always possible that the next one will blow my mind.
