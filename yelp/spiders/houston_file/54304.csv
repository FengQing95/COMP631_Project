Kata Robata////I am not a big sushi fan but my friends are so I make like a good friend and tag along. One uneventful night, we were bored and decided to do some sushi hopping. Ra for happy hour, Kata for dinner, and Uptown Sushi for dessert. Let me tell you, it definitely turned our night around and one lychee martini after another makes for darn good time.
