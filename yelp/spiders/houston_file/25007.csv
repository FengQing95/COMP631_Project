Uchi////Wow! From the moment I walked in to the second I walked out I probably was speechless multiple times. 1) the attention from the waitstaff was fantastic. They were super welcoming and helpful explaining each of the dishes. 2) the food is absolutely amazing. The tapas style dishes are small but absolutely worth it. I swear its like taking a bite into culinary magic. Although there are more options available and the portions are bigger during  dinner, but the sake social from 4-6:30 is the best way to get a taste of Uchi for a great price. It really makes fine dinning a more affordable experience.  But honestly, once you try Uchi you really begin to see food and cuisine differently.
