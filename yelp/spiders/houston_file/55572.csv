Kata Robata////I got here around 6:30 pm on a Friday night with a colleague. We didn't want to wait for 30 minutes to get a table inside so we chose to sit outside in the patio area. Kinda regretted out decision once we found out the patio is not well climate-controlled, and it was a cold night in Houston. However, the food made up for it.
