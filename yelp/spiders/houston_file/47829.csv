Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really liked the food at snooze when I had it in Austin but when you're given a severe underestimation of wait time and you have to wait in the Houston humidity and heat or the small entry way AND park super far, it is not worth it at all. When we were finally seated the service was good and the dishes we had were good but the extended wait made us lose our appetites. We were told 45-1hr and waited over 1.5 hours for a less than 30 minute meal. Get the eggs Benedict you can't go wrong.
