Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I started with the 38 Special cocktail and pulled pork hush puppies and finished (with help) The Revolver and Cajun Brick Chicken. The cocktails were carefully crafted and the food was extremely tasteful and addictive. The decor and warm friendliness of the staff made it a unique and comfortable experience. Megan took care of us at the bar and I was impressed by her knowledge, pizzazz and professionalism.
