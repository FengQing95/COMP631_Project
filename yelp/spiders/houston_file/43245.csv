Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The French toast (called Pain Perdu, meaning "Lost Bread" in French) is THE BEST BREAKFAST DISH TO EXIST ON EARTH. The rich, yet light, smooth, airy, caramelized taste and texture of the dish is incomparable. Minus celiac individuals, this dish is an absolute mandatory consumable for every person on the planet. I would list other favorites of mine, but I have yet to try something that I didn't think was fantastic in quality and experience. Honestly, you must try the simple baguette. It has an earthy and comforting smell upon cracking the crust, and a taste that is simple, yet wholly gratifying, for any palette. If man had to live on bread alone, it should be this bread.
