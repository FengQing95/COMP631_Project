Uchi////When seated, our server greeted us and he was so friendly. He explained how the restaurant works: everything is small plates. We had the option of a chef's tasting menu, a signature tasting menu or ordering regularly off the menu. So then he explains that we can build a menu off of the chef's tasting so we took that option. There were Â a few things we wanted to try so he jotted those down and told us he's going to build some flavors from there. I'm in, eff my palate up!
