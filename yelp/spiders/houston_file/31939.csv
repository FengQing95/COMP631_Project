Local Foods////I debated about giving 4 instead of 5 stars because of Local Food's limited menu. If I compared this restaurant with a place that had larger menu with warm entries, I would be comparing apples with paper cups - not a logical thing to do. But comparing it against other restaurants that have a most cold food menu & outdoor eating area, Local Food is 5 star.
