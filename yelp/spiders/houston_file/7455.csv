JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We love their food! Parking garage is near by. The walk to the resturant is nice because you pass by other shops. If you go on the weekend their might be a wait. They do have happy hour specials through out the week (food and drinks). They also have a full bar. At the bar you can watch sports (this is the only area they have TV's). They have "Chicken nuggets" for the little ones.
