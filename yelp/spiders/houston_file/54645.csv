Kata Robata////I understand that many people come here for the sushi. They rave that this is one of the best sushi locations. This may be true, if compared only to Houston area locations. I've had sushi here multiple times, but I could tell that the fish were not so fresh; it was beginning to dry out and the flavors were fading. As salmon roe is one of my favorites, I have ordered it multiple times. In all instances, I was not impressed. However, one visit was detrimental. The salmon roe was fishy beyond belief, as if it had been soaking in a fish tank. I could tell that the salmon roe had spoiled. Therefore, when coming to Kata Robata I no longer eat sushi as their quality of seafood is questionable at best.
