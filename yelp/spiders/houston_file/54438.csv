Kata Robata////The sushi is nothing to write home about- it's definitely good, but not over-the-top amazing.  The rolls are alright, and the sashimi is delicious and fresh (we got the boat last time we went, split between four people). BUT, if you venture away from the sushi on the menu, they have a lot of really amazing dishes.  If you have a thing for bone marrow, you HAVE to order theirs.  They give you three huge pieces with bread on the side, and the buttery fat just melts in your mouth.  In fact, I'd go back just for that.  Also, their lobster mac n cheese is delicious.  It's not TOO cheesy and has lobster chunks in it.  My boyfriend made fun of me for months for coming to a sushi restaurant and ordering mac n cheese but I'D DO IT AGAIN.  All in all, I've had great experiences here.
