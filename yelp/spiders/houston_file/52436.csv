Kata Robata////This is one of my go to sushi places. I love the sexy scallop and the New Zealand salmon sushi. The lobster mac and cheese is to die for! I'm glad my friend introduced me to it. It's not something I would thought of to order at a sushi place but I'm in love with it now. It's great for sharing since it might be too filling for one. The drinks here are always yummy. And do get the dessert - the sorbet/gelato? is refreshing, especially the Yuzu flavored one.
