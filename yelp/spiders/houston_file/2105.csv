JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello ying - Thanks for your feedback. I'm sorry to hear that you feel JINYA did not meet your expectations. For starters, I agree that loud music isn't for everyone and I'm the type that enjoys dinner over soft music; however, you are correct that JINYA's concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. Our restaurant will never be all things to all people, but those are the guidelines we are required to follow as a franchisee. I will relay your message to corporate and perhaps we can make some changes in the future to better accommodate those who don't prefer the loud music.
