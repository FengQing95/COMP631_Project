JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When I try ramen, I evaluate the main components separately before considering the overall quality of the dish. Since my general philosophy when trying a new food place is to try their signature dish, I went with the Tonkotsu black ramen. The broth first - the broth was rich and smooth, with great savory and spicy character. It didn't seem too salty, which is a common danger with ramen broth. The noodles were well-cooked, al dente to provide an enjoyable degree of bite. The pork was nice, tender, and flavorful, but there wasn't a high volume of it. Most of the toppings were nothing special, but they were quite complimentary and true to traditional form. I was intrigued by the fried onion bits - I thought that they added some good flavor and texture, but they also tangled together into one big mass. Overall, the ramen was great, though not the best I've ever had (that was in Seattle, a hub for Japanese culture, to be fair).
