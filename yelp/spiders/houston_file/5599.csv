JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ramsay - Thank you for your great review. I'm so glad to hear we are your favorite ramen spot. We greatly appreciate it. We will be opening a very large JINYA off FM1960 in the new year, so hopefully that will alleviate some of the heavy crowds at Midtown. We'll see. But thank you again for the kind words, and we look forward to your next visit.
