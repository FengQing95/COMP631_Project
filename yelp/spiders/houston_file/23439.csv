Uchi////When they kept bringing out one (very small) plate for us to share, though we paid for two tastings, I actually went and asked the "manager".  This was a rude guy who looked to be in his early 20's, who informed me that many restaurants have you share plates for the omikase.   You're saying you might be with a co-worker and you have to eat off the same plate??  That's weird to me.  I also mentioned the lack of service and no he didn't apologize or try to make up for it in anyway.
