JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The entrees were good. I had the medium spicy chicken and loved the broth. It was the perfect heat for me. The meat was so-so. Felt it could have been a bit more fatty/flavorful. The missus had the Tonkotsu black and loved it. I tried her broth and it was quite good and I look forward to going back and trying it myself.
