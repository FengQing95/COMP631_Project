The Pit Room////Absolutely great BBQ.  I'm from California, I visit family several times a year and try to get here every time I visit! The beef rib is amazing! I tried the jalapeño cheddar sausage for the first time on my last trip and that was almost as good as the rib.  Definitely go here if you're visiting and looking for the best TX BBQ in town.
