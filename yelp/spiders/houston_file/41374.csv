Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here for lunch.  The bakery items and coffee are terrific and the prices are very reasonable for the quality.  I had a sticky bun, macarons, and a olive walnut loaf.  I was eager to try a croissant but they were sold out.   The sticky bun was excellent; I loved the caramel pecan topping.  The olive walnut bread was great but I probably wouldn't get it again for $7.50.
