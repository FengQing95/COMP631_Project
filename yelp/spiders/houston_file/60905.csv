Baby Barnaby's////How have I never reviewed Baby Barnaby's?! It's definitely one of my favorite casual brunch spots in Montrose for a few reasons: really friendly/nice waiters, AMAZING breakfast potatoes (SERIOUSLY, the best), and DELICIOUS green eggs. I've had the french toast before but it was just okay, would much prefer the pancakes. It's not fancy brunch by any means but it has enough to keep everyone happy and fed and is cute to boot.
