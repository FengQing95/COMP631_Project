JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Boyfriend got the tonkatsu black. He seemed to like it. Broth was thick, milky. His came with a seasoned egg, but they didn't cut it in half like most places... But the egg was cooked well. He thought the chasu was okay-- his broke apart and was tender but it wasn't fatty.
