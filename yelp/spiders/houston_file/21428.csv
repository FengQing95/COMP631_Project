Uchi////My wife and I went for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. We were both very impressed with how tentative the staff was and how knowledgeable every staff member was about the different dishes. We opted to do the Omakase and allowed our waiter to select the dishes based on our food preferences which we shared with him. Each dish was on point and really gave a huge variety of different flavors and cooking styles. From nigiri to short ribs and oysters each dish was delicious from the moment it hit the tongue. We will definitely be back!
