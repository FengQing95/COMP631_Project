Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Here on business from Chicago and wow...just wow. From the food, to the hostess, to the bartenders...wow. Tried coming in earlier during my week stay and the restaurant was closed for a private event. The hostess, finding out I was from out of town and looking forward to eating here, gave me a voucher for my next visit. I came back later in the week to eat and ordered the short ribs with a side of the cornbread. I grabbed my knife and fork to dig into the short ribs and found out rather quickly that a knife was absolutely useless...the short ribs just fell apart!!! Juicy, tender, saucy, and flat out delicious! The scalloped potatoes, green beans, and lightly breaded onion straws/rings were awesome too! The cornbread with the jam butter...perfect addition. Sweet and savory, I could have ordered another one. I'm going to be transferring to Houston and will be coming back, again, and again, and again once I'm here full time. Food and staff are awesome!!!
