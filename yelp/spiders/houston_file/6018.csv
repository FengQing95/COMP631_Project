JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy tonkotsu comes in mild, spicy, and hot; I pulled a Goldilocks and went for the spicy option. The red bowl came out with egg served separately on the side. Pro-tip: plop your egg in the soup so the temperature equilibrates. The spice level was definitely enough but not overwhelming so that I couldn't finish my bowl. Thick, strongly flavored broth. Gets a little salty by the end of the meal but overall solid. Loved the texture of the chewy thick noodles!
