Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Met a friend here for a brainstorming session and I was completely blown away. The presentation. The pastries. The pastels! I mean the case of desserts which is an array of fresh made macaroons, mini cheesecakes, croissants, etc alone just makes you want to try everything ! I am a super fan of Johnny Carrabas restaurants so maybe I'm biased lol. I decided to go with the Croqué Madam and an Arnold Palmer. The Croqué Madam was amazing to say the least the 63 degree cooked egg was runny perfection on top of the crisp bread and cheese! The sweet mini gherkins on the side were a great touch. The atmosphere is great for grabbing a cup of coffee while catching up on emails or meeting a friend for brunch and sharing a box of macaroons for dessert (which is now on my to do list by the way). I will be back super soon! Another great concept!
