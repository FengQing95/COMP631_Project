Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Everything I say about this place is going to fall short. The coffee is great and the pastries and desserts are out of the world. The chocolate chunk cookies are excellent and probably the best we have ever had. I was just a bit disappointed with their chocolate croissant. There was chocolate filling inside and I think it would taste better if served warm, so that the chocolate inside is molten.
