JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've have a had a couple of firsts since relocating down to Houston.  One of the thrills in a top 5 largest city is access to every cuisine on the cultural spectrum.  Ramen, if you haven't tried it, is quickly shuffling to the top of my "what're we having?" "how about ramen?" lists.
