Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The resturant was really cute!!! Love the DJ and the atmosphere.  Service was outstanding, I was with a large group and Terry (our server) was amazing!!!! He handle the group with grace,  not allowing our drinks to get low.....he was attentive!!! Terry also had an amazing personality!!! I would definitely return, but probably just for drinks,  wasn't that impressed with the food.
