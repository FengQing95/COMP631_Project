Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is trying to go for a retro feel with leather burnt orange/olive green tones and little popping light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. I can dig it, it's pretty suitable and chipper for the brunch atmosphere they're trying to create. I hear the lines are ridiculous on Sunday, so perhaps coming here at a random hour in the afternoon would actually benefit you and cut down on wait time.
