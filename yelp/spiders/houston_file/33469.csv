Local Foods////I've been to Local Foods only a handful of times over the course of a year, but I think I get it now. Food's fresh, it's interesting, and they offer much more healthful sides than the crap you'd get at any chain. Plus, sandwich portions are pretty generous, so it's not uncommon to see peeps sharing. There are few things not to admire about this place, except maybe the parking sitch during peak lunch hours.
