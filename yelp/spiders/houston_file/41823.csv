Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After talking about coming here for ages and ages, I finally came on a whim yesterday afternoon with my friend. I ordered a vanilla latte and we shared the chocolate walnut cookie. The latte was slightly too sweet for my own personal taste, but the coffee itself was very aromatic! The chocolate walnut cookie was heavenly: crispy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. I don't know how they achieved such texture perfection, but these cookies would be dangerous in large quantities. I will definitely be back to try the almond croissant and the macarons!
