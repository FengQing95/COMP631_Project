Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visit two: Let's start with my freebie from Theresa, Hot Chocolate, paired perfectly with my Molten Chocolate Pancake. Well duh, I wasn't going to pass up that Pancake Flight, a second time. Let me tell you, Theresa described the pancake of the day to me. I thought within me, "that sounds disgusting". I told her go ahead and give it to me; I try super hard to step out of my comfort zone. Usually it's an utter fail.
