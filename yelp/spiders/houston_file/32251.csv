Local Foods////Local Foods is an excellent lunch spot if you can past a few complaints (none of which are really their fault). This place is way too popular. There is not enough parking and the lines to order are ludicrously long. There isn't enough seating so expect to stand around for a bit till someone finally gets up. On our first visit the also sold out of their special of the day. None of these are actual complaints and are actually more testaments of their success.
