Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hype...Hype...Hype... So I decided to try this place out after it opened in my neighborhood and I read a bunch of reviews on Yelp about how this was America's best bakery! (Wait...wait... didn't this place just open up a several months ago!) How can it be the best in the America? Â If I have never heard of one person in my life visiting Houston just for Common Bond Bakery. I'm also a 31 year old Houston native too by the way!
