JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Please know, Anh, that we value your patronage and you certainly have every right to rate us "one star" based on your experience. But given the power of hindsight, I would have authorized as much additional bok choy or any other topping and paid for it out of my own pocket if it would have served to make you a satisfied customer. As such, I can only offer an apology and a promise that should you choose to return to JINYA -- and I sincerely hope that you do -- me and my staff of 30+ people, whose very livelihoods and their families' livelihoods depend on this restaurant's reputation, will do everything in our power to accommodate you.
