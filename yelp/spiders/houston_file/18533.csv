Uchi////ABSOLUTE FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN HOUSTON! Only downside is trying to get a reservation short notice. The servers are generally very knowledgable about the menu (I'm GF) and the kitchen is always super accommodating. We usually get the chefs tasting menu then add a few of our favs. Well worth the money for sure!
