Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It was really busy. The line was moving very slow. The counter lady was very rude, impatient and rush. She looked very upset. I think you had a busy day wasn't my fault. Well may be it's part of my fault because I should have gone to other places so I wouldn't make her busy day busier.
