JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Took the family here for dinner tonight and had a terrible experience.  Was told it was a 15 minute wait and that we could sit at the bar.  We did and my wife and I each ordered a beer.  The wait was longer than usual and the crowd waiting for tables got larger.  The staff directed other patrons to the bar for full dinner service and those individuals ousted our party from our seats.  Staff did nothing to address the situation.  We left without ever being seated.  We will never return to this establishment and strongly recommend others avoid.
