Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We made reservations and tried to visit Bosscat with friends a couple of weeks ago.  But when I arrived, they couldn't find our reservation in the computer and kept asking for our "code"--because we made reservations on the phone, we didn't have a "code", so they told us the wait would be 40 minutes, though they'd try to seat us earlier.  No way were we waiting for 40 minutes at a restaurant where we'd made reservations, so we went to Eloise Nichols across the street, and they were super nice and managed to squeeze us in.
