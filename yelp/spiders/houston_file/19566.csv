Uchi////So our trend of marvelous meals at restaurants listed on Alison Cook's Top 10 list continues. Another rainy night, and another delicious meal at a restaurant that we went to with high expectations (because of all the hype here on Yelp and from our friends). Because the menu was so novel and we didn't want a sushi focused meal, we let our waitress Lauren pretty much choose for us with some stipulations: little or no sushi/sashimi, and no meat dishes. So she brought us mostly cooked seafood and veggie dishes, and pretty much decided what we should eat. And boy did she come through.
