JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So i have to admit... this place is on the fence for me. The first time we went here. We decided to go with the specials. They rotate each month (according to the menu). My boyfriend had the spicy miso and I had the special cha-cha-cha (garlic). I was really sad to see that they were below par. I read that this is the best ramen place in Houston... and well... I didn't see it. It was super bland.
