Uchi////So far, I'm liking very much.  Ok now, what's this?  There's a man walking around with a dish of free food for waiting guest.  He tells us to take as many as we want.  It's like some tempura jalapeno appetizer.  Who cares what it is, that's awesome!  That's great customer service!  So, we order the Yokai Berry, then a free dish gets sent to us, then another.  We order the brussel sprouts, then 2 more free dishes.  Goodness this place is crazy!  Are they trying to go out of business?  Plus, I'm starting to get full and we haven't even looked at the dinner menu.  Apparently, this is their thing.  They give free food out to their waiting and sometimes dining patrons because they want to invest in their customers.  That's such an unconventional idea, but brilliant!
