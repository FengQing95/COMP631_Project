Baby Barnaby's////Be prepared to wait, especially during peak times like brunch and the weekend. There's limited seating indoors and outdoors. Fortunately, they offer complimentary hot coffee while you wait. Also, make sure to put your name down on the clipboard hanging outside. It's not like most restaurant where there's a host to take down your name.
