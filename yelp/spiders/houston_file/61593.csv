Baby Barnaby's//// Pink and white scramble (ham chunks & white cheddar , scrambled with 3 eggs, served with potatoes and wheat toast) The ham scrambled eggs was a little wet. Dont know if that's how it's supposed to be. The cheddar was incorporated well and gave a cheese pull. I love love their potatoes, which are actually little potato cubes. Delicious every time.
