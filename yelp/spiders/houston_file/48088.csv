Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Best pancakes I've EVER had and they were FREE! I came here to meet up with my mom and her friends and wasn't planning on getting anything, but I ended up ordering a cappuccino. Their orders arrived and apparently it took a while (but I totally didn't notice) and our server gave us a half order of their apple pie pancakes on the house!! Which was funny because those ended up being the best pancakes I've ever had in my life lol. Although I could do without the cappuccino, this place deserves 10 stars! Line is long, weekend or weekday, but that's expected. This place is awesome!
