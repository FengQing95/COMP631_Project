Kata Robata////My wife and I have been Kubo regulars for a couple of years and were excited to see what Chef Horiuchi could do with a higher budget and new digs.  Well, we had mixed feelings when we saw that menu was quite similar to the menu he created at Kubo.  I mean, I love it, but how about something new?
