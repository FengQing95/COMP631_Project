Uchi////Uchi. Where do I even begin. I came here for the first time December 30th and since then have been back 3 times. I AM OBSESSED. The flavor combinations and tastebud blowing food is worth the price and for me, life changing. Â I love how Uchi combined flavors from all over the world to make their dishes and it makes me really think about the thought behind the bites.
