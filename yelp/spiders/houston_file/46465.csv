Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every day, 1 hour before closing, their pastries will be 1/2 off!! This was seriously game changing because I love their pastries and breads so much but can't afford to get $4 croissants that often. I went in a couple days ago ~45 min before closing and got a pistachio croissant, butter croissant, almond croissant, Boston creme, walnut choco chip cookie, apple cider ginger snap cookie, and a whole loaf of bread - everything all together came to a total price of ~$16 which is seriously seriously a steal for this place. Their croissants are huge and so buttery and airy - so worth it. Also their Apple cider ginger snap cookie is maybe one of the best cookies I've ever had- it's super chewy and pillowy with the perfect balance of spice and sweetness. And their bread!!! A WHOLE loaf of multigrain for $2.50 you seriously can't beat that kind of quality with that price. Highly recommend. If you come the hour before closing, come early because I got the last pistachio croissant and Boston creme that day so if you come earlier there may be a bigger selection.
