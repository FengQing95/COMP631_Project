Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think I got better at picking entrees here. My go to brunch lunch item is their quiche with salad. Their quiche is out of this world- crispy flaky butter crust with a fluffy egg filling and the salad is always well dressed and fresh. I've also been eating inordinate amounts of their French and sourdough loaves. My one quibble is their kougin amans are too big; this usually isn't a complaint of mine but there's so much bread I feel like I'm not getting a good toppings/glaze to bread ratio in each bite. All in all, a very small complaint against numerous delicious meals shared here. All my out of town family and friends love this spot!
