JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was staying at the HIE downtown for a business trip and wanted something outside the realm of American food for a change and this hit the spot!!!! I had the Tonkotsu Black ramen for my meal and a JINYA bun for an appetizer. The music was a little too loud for my taste but the service and food made up for it. Facility was clean and safe.
