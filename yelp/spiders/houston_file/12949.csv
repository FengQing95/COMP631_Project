JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen spot in midtown. Definitely can see why it's one of everyone's favorite ramen restaurants here in houston. I really liked the interior decor and ambiance of this hip ramen spot. I got sat at the long middle table which has a lot of stool chairs where people share and sit close to one another. For appetizer we ordered gyoza, and the karaage. Definitely order the smallest portion of this that you can, I did and I thought it wasn't enough, but when they came out it was huge. We didn't even finish this chicken, we had to take the rest to go. The fried dumpling/gyoza was really good. Takoyaki was also very good, great sharing size as well. Ramen here was great, and I like how you can add whatever toppings you like inside. Chopped garlic was free.
