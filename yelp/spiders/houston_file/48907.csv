Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I personally am a fan of savory breakfast food rather than the sweets, so I ordered the breakfast pot pie, which sounded interesting. but uninterestingly enough, 20ish minutes later, it was simply just a flake pastry pressed into a shallow 'bowl' shape with a ladle of sausage gravy over it. the hash browns that it was served with was very standard; looks nice but the taste did not match the appearance. Â The only part i truly enjoyed of the dish was the fried egg on top.
