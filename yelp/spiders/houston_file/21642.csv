Uchi////Brought my sister to Uchi while she was visiting. We had amazing and attentive waitstaff, who answered all of our questions. We sat at the bar where the chefs made sushi right in front of us, so it was also visually fun! Our chef explained the history of sushi, as well as a few of the steps while making it, so we felt like royalty--definitely recommend this seat if you're a foodie. The ingredients are super fresh and we even got a free dessert on the house from our chef (after ordering one, of course haha)! Best high-end experience I've had in Houston so far. Come here if you want to impress someone or if you're celebrating. Just be prepared for a little bit of a wait (nice waiting area outside with water/drinks). Enjoy!
