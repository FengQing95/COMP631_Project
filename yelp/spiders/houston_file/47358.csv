Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First, I must say the food was excellent my whole party loved everything. My only complaint is the parking, there is only one handicap spot and it was blocked by a tent and other patrons playing corn hole. We waited in the parking lot while the lot attendant notified the manager. The lot attendant was very helpful Â and allowed us to park in a "reserved" section of the parking lot. The manager quickly came out to remedy the situation. The warm and wonderful service continued inside and the accommodations for my special needs son allowed us to enjoy a fantastic meal.
