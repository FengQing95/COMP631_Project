Uchi////We were so excited to eat here, but we had a bad experience. We found a long hair in one of the rolls. Then we asked for an extra glass because my friend and i wanted to share a drink we ordered and we were told "no, i cannot bring you one" even though we are both way passed 21 years old. It was very unprofessional to say that in this way! We got a $25 gift card for the inconvenience of the hair, but my friend could not eat anymore. She was grossed out! So disappointed!
