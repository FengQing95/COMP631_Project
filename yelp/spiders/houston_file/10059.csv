JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Michele - Thank you for the great review. We truly appreciate it. Apologies for the oil in your gyoza. Please know that you can always send back food if you are not 100% satisfied. We will remake the dish or offer an alternative. I'm glad, though, that you enjoyed all of our other dishes. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you again in the future.
