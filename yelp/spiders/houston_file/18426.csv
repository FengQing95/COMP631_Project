Uchi////At about 9:15 they still couldn't tell us when we would have our table and I contemplated leaving and going over to Dolce Vita (who we called and could accomodate us).  This was on the verge of ridiculous and it was my birthday and i was hungry and cranky.  The restaurant in a last ditch effort to keep us from leaving actually asked the table seated ahead of us (late also by the way - probably didn't have all of their party) to pack up.
