Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////ehhh nothing I cant get at central market just a few blocks down the road.  I was excited about what I had heard about this place, after going, sadly I wasn't impressed.  The food seemed pretty pedestrian, so if the Denies up the road is busy I might come back.
