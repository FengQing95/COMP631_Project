Local Foods////I've visited a handful of times and I believe their menu is somewhat seasonal. Usually there will be one or two new sandwiches in rotation. My two personal favorites are the truffled egg salad and the achiote pork torta. The egg salad is on pretzel, um, YUM!!! It's not hard or dry, like pretzel buns from other sandwiches places. The torta is on a delicious baguette-like bread with avocado spread, pickled purple onions, and cilantro. The pork is actually very moist and flavorful, and this is coming from someone whose least favorite meat is pork. Definitely a must try if it's on the menu (I believe this is one that they rotate).
