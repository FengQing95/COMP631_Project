Uchi////I think we ordered every item on the HH menu.  The food quality was outstanding.  Our favorite was the Walu Walu.  The fish just melted in our mouth.  Ended up repeating the order a couple of times.  The hot sake is an amazing deal at HH as well; can't remember how many of those we ordered.
