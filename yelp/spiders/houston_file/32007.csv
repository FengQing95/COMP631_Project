Local Foods////Consistently good, and you don't hate yourself afterward because of how fresh and well prepared everything is. The smoked salmon sandwich is my favorite indulgence, though their salad specials are great too. And you can make any sandwich into a salad. The beet side with mint and wheatberry is my favorite out of everything on the menu.
