JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was super excited to try this place because I was craving ramen and read all the great reviews. I started off with the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura and it was delicious. I don't think it was spicy at all, but I'm good with that because I don't like a lot of heat. I then had the Jinya Chicken Ramen and I thought it was good, but kind of on the salty side. I couldn't finish mine because it was a bit too salty. My bf's ramen on the other other hand wasn't as salty as mine, and we had the same thing, so maybe mine just got messed up a little.
