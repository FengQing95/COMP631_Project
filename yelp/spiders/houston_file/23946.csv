Uchi////I've long been a fan of their Walu Walu ($17), a oak grilled escolar with candied citrus and yuzu (umami) flavoring throughout. The Hamachi Nabe ($18) is a savory dish consisting of yellowtail, koshihihikari rice over soy broth and eggyolk. Finally, the Hot Rock ($19) is a wonderful bit of wagyu beef on its own in ponzu sauce, but it's even better with a diver scallop and sanbaizu. From the cold side, I am a sucker for the Machi Cure ($18), which is smoked yellowtail, marcona almond with a yucca crisp.
