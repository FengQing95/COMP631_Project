Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I had a drink.  On our attentive server's recommendation, I had the House Old Fashioned (Makers Mark, Sugar, Bitters, Orange... $12) which was good and had a nice big ice cube in it, which I appreciated.  We also split the pulled pork hush puppies which were very good.
