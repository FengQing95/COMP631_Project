Baby Barnaby's////A bit later, we get our OJ and order some food (price range: $6-$9). I get the Green eggs. While we wait, I try out the OJ. That thing was the freshest OJ I've ever had. It was like I was biting a slice of orange minus the biting. Pulp everywhere and it wasn't cold, not that that's a bad thing. It wasn't like you just opened the fridge to pour some orange juice; it was more like someone JUST squeezed an orange into the cup in front of you. Are you convinced that this place serves fresh OJ yet? I hope so. Apparently they also have freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.
