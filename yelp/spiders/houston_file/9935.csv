JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Marcela - Thank you for your review. Our Tonkotsu White features pork and chicken broth, and at present we do not offer any form of beef broth at any of our locations (yet). Regardless, I'm sorry you did not enjoy your ramen. Please know that if you're ever unhappy with any of our dishes for any reason, to inform your server who will gladly remake the bowl or suggest an alternative. Thanks again for your visit.
