The Pit Room////Good BBQ here folks, but the consistency can be touch and go. A problem I see with too many places is they do not train their cutters well. I have had some really subpar cuts here sometimes. When the brisket, ribs and sausage are on their game they are really really good. Three kinds of sausage they make at the restaurant are really good and you do not find that often in Houston. The tacos are really good too. Sides are better than your average menu but nothing super memorable. They have a great pickle bar and lots of sauces they make from scratch. The coffee bourbon sauce is one of the strangest I have ever tasted. I cannot imagine what meat it would be good on. I would skip that one if I were you. Prices are on the high end but that is to be expected with the area they are in. Overall I am a fan of Pit Room. They are one of the best in Houston but a step below the really great places.
