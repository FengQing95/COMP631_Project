Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came out to celebrate a new job for a friend and had an amazing time. The ambience was great for a night out with friends. It was very nice yet laid back enough for fun times with friends. The food and drinks were delicious. I had the hot brown open faced turkey sandwich and boss lady vol.2. I highly enjoyed the fries! Terry was a fantastic server! Ask for him for sure!! You won't be disappointed
