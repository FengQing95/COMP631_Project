Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As some of my friends know, I love bread. I can just feast on bread and butter and enjoy the heck out of it. I think it's my wife Vanessa who turns me into bread appreciation. I'm usually very happy when a restaurant serves nice freshly baked bread and take pride in serving it to their customers.
