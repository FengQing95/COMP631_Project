Kata Robata////We love Kata. Situated in an unassuming shopping center just off 59, you would expect to get average sushi here but you'd be utterly wrong! This is one of the very best sushi restaurants in town, with unusual flavor combinations, gorgeous plating, delicious cocktails, and a lively, friendly environment. Try to get in at the sushi bar so you can watch the master, Chef Horiuchi, preform his magic. He's a quiet fellow with a broad smile and a warm personality, but his real strength is in his astounding talent for creating inventive sushi dishes and incredibly delicious kitchen plates. My current favorite is the cold curry noodle bowl. It's the stuff of dreams.
