Kata Robata////I've been here a few times and didn't really think much of it. It was more than 9 months since I last went and didn't really expect much. Boy was I wrong. I ate the Kobe beef robata and with the first bite, I felt like the meat talked to my soul. It was soft, tender, and marinated. The meat just melted in my mouth. Afterwards, I had the spicy ramen. It was really solid. Not something that I would rave about but it hit the spot. I would get it again. I didn't have sushi this time but those two dishes alone made my meal a very pleasant one. Overall, the prices are a little pricey but it comes with being a very good restaurant. Try this place! You will not be disappointed!
