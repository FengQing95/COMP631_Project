Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I made a reservation through Yelp for this restaurant because of the high ratings. I dined with 3 people on an early Friday evening. We started with pork belly poutine and pig candy. Pig candy was very good. Pork belly poutine was just okay compared to pig candy. I had the spicy crab pasta as my entree and it was underwhelming. It was a tad bit spicy but mostly flat in other flavor. Our server was very nice but they did mess up my brother in law's order because they forgot the egg on his sandwich.
