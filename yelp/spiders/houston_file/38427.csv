Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Perfect spot ducked off in a peaceful area. I was craving pancakes and came across this place. They were delicious! Fluffy, buttery, with a perfect bite. The sausage I chose over bacon reminded me of a thick country pan sausage. The service was excellent and get this, the restrooms clean! I recommend this place and will be back!
