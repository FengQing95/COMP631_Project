Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking can be a problem so wear walking shoes or uber.  Our waitress was amazing!  So friendly and patient with hungry people that wanted to try every item on the menu.  This place is a gold mine.  Everything is so so yummy.  They made a mean bloody mary too.  Go early cause there can be a long wait but its so worth it.  Will be back wearing my stretchiest  pants.
