JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was really excited to try this place out after searching for a place comparable to Ramen Tatsu-ya in Austin... I ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy and I was sort of disappointed. The thin noodle is definitely better, i messed up and got the thick. But other than that the broth was pretty good. I like how they have a lot of options to add to your ramen. Overall the atmosphere was really nice and they were quick at getting us a table. I will probably try this place out again and get the thin noodle. But i really want to try Tiger Den.
