The Pit Room////Amazing barbecue place. Super authentic and love the vibe! Got my food and was able to sit outside on the patio while watching a game on tv. Food lives up to the hype. I got the two meat dinner (pork ribs and brisket) with elote and Mac n cheese. It was all sooo good! Meat is so tender and falls right off the bone while the sides all meet the high expectations. Delicious and will definitely be coming back!
