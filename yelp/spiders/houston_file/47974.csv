Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome brunch spot....but it is ALWAYS packed and they do not take reservations!  That being said, when I came on a Saturday I ordered my food to-go.  The Sweet Potato Pancakes were delicious...and so filling (I didn't even manage to eat them all)!  The bacon was crispy, just the way I like it.  The next time I return I'm trying the French toast, because it sounded equally good.
