Kata Robata////Overall, this place is definitely worthwhile to try. I absolutely recommend the meals I had and would absolutely get it again, but I just wanted to plug in that it may be worthwhile to just let your server know your budget goals and have their recs surprise you! I learned that a lot of them have worked there for awhile and who's better to get advice from than the experts from there?
