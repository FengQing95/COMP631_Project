Local Foods////Love everything about the place.   I've tried a variety of the sandwiches and they are sublime.   The Asian chicken salad is also amazing.   I could eat there every day of the week!    The kale salad is also super delicious.     Have I mentioned how cool the atmosphere is and the music is awesome.
