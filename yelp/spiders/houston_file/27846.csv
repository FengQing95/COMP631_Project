The Pit Room////Took my wife to the Pit Room this week after a three week vacation in Italy where BBQ is completely unknown.  We both a beef brisket and Cole slaw.  This has to be the best BBQ in the greater Houston area.  The folks behind the counter are friendly and efficient.  BBQ is wonderful.  The Cole slaw is spicy and delicious.
