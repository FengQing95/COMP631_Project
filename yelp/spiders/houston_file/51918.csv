Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although it appeared smaller than expected on the inside there was more than enough space. Atmosphere was relaxed. A nice to place to go to for a quick brunch with friends or family. It gave off an upscale diner vibe. I ordered 2 sunny side up eggs, a pancake flight: sweet potato, blueberry and pineapple upside down, and eggs Benedict: Habanero pork belly and salmon, and mimosas. I would recommend those 2 choices if you ever plan on visiting. Overall, my favorite part of this meal was the habanero pork belly eggs Benedict and sweet potato pancake. Service was good, fast and reliable
