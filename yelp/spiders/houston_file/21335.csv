Uchi////To top it all off, when we asked for the check, our server realized we didn't order dessert and gave us 2 free ones because she saw how much we enjoyed the food, and told us it'd be a shame if we didn't try their desserts. One was the famous fried milk, the other I'm not exactly sure (peanut butter semifreddo maybe?). Either way, both were delicious and honestly went beyond all my expectations. I'm not a dessert person (it's why we didn't order any), but when I come back again, I will definitely have to order the fried milk. Even it was well-balanced. Not too sweet, just a tad savory, and over all an excellent blend of unexpected textures. I really only have praise for this place.
