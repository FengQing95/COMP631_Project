Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I enjoyed that they actually serve you the coffee and hot food at your table #, rather than some other coffee & breakfast spots where you have to listen over a loud weekend morning crowd for your name to pickup. No issues with parking but were there at 8:30am on a Sunday and saw someone had just pulled out of a space.
