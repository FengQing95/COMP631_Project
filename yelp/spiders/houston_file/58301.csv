Baby Barnaby's////the place was a little small, so the place was pretty crowded (i guess that's why they call it the 'baby' location?). but that was my only complaint (that and almost no parking). but the people were nice and the food was delicious!!! definitely glad i read the reviews and ordered me the green eggs because it was delicious!!
