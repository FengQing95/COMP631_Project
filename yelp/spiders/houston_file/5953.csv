JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen here is underwhelming. The eggs are a little too sweet for me, the noodles are too thin, the broth is mediocre, the toppings are all good, the beer is cold. The parking is cool, but sucks. You will understand when you get there. With all of the ramen places popping up, ninja has been the best with this one coming in 3rd so far.
