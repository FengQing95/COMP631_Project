Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been to Bosscat a handful of times and it's always enjoyable. The servers and bartenders are friendly and the place has a chill fun energy, but with a sense of classiness. It's the type of place you want to go with friends for drinks after work, a date or for brunch (my favorite). The staff wear their masks properly which is much appreciated during this time.
