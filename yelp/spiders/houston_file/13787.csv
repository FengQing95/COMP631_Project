JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Anytime I'm in Houston I make it a top priority to visit this place! I LOVE their ramen! Â I always go for the spiciest option they have. If you can handle spice well, definitely go for it. The chicken wontons are good too! For $2 more you can get extra noodles which is a must for me whenever I come here. Make sure your full party is with you otherwise you won't be seated. This place is in high demand and is always busy so plan accordingly.
