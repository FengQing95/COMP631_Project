Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was delicious! I came during restaurant week with two friends and everyone loved their dishes. I had the crab cake for my first course and it was spicy with a great sauce. The second course was the naked honey chicken and succotash. The portion size was great and everything was well seasoned. We also shared the Mac and cheese from the regular menu and it was delicious and cheesy. The third course was the blueberry and peach cobbler and it was soooooo good. The drinks were kind of small but strong, I had a regular Long Island iced tea. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and service was quick. Great ambiance it was a little loud though. No trouble finding parking.
