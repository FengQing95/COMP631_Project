Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Hostess was rude. I came here to celebrate my birthday, and she completely ruined it with her attitude. She sat us near the door and it was a little cold for me. When we asked to be seated at a table she was had an attitude then walked us to a table right in front of the kitchen that hadn't even been cleaned off. I will never come back here again.
