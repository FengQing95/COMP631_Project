Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the Lower East Sider (lox salmon, goat cheese spread, rustic bread, greens, tomato + caper relish). HELLO LOVAH. Next time, I would totes get the poached eggs (bonus: substitutions/personalizations are encouraged - HALLELUJAH!). Snooze knows how to cook perfect eggs perfectly, whether hard boiled, poached or scrambled - which is dang hard to find.
