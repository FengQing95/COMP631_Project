JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been a few times with my sister and friend when they came to visit. The Ramen is so yummy and the waitstaff are friendly and helpful in their recommendations. I really liked the traditional Tonkatsu Ramen, my friend and I shared some Brussels sprouts, it was a great addition to share.
