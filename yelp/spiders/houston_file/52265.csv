Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I hate that I keep disappointing myself by going back to this establishment. I feel that I am a fairly understanding person, Â but I definitely don't understand why their service is so slow when there is hardly anyone in there. This is the second time I have placed an order over the phone and was informed that my order was being started when I walk in. The young staff seem to take their time with every task except of maybe 2-3 servers. They have horrible over the phone service, failing to let me know when they are out of items , failing to tell me the price of my order (especially when they surprise me with an upcharge), and failing to check the food before they hand it to me. Snooze just doesn't seem to be the same anymore. :(
