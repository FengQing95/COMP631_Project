Uchi////A whimsical dinner experience.....i recently tried uchi after hearing rave reviews about it and they surpassed my expectations when it comes to sushi!  Me and my 2 girlfriends shared about 2.5 glasses of wine each and about 7 dishes; the brussel sprouts (must try dish), onion tempura (crispy and stayed intact, which hard to perfect), hirame usuzukuri (thinly sliced flounder), hama chili (yellowtail with thai chili), karaage (fried chicken with pickled veggies), kinoko nabe (my veggie friend raved about) and a veggie entree we asked for the kitchen to make for her.  The ambiance and vibe of the restaurant was lively and happening, the staff bring amuse-bouche for patrons as they wait on their tables (total enticement and great marketing).  We will be back.....
