Baby Barnaby's////Always a lineup on the weekends, but it moves fast and you can get self serve coffee while you wait. The green eggs are amazing (must be the stick of butter they put in it), but the corned beef hash was a bit too greasy for my taste. I also recommend the waffles with fresh berries.
