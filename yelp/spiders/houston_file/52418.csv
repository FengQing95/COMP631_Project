Kata Robata////Great Customer Service and the BEST Japanese Restaurant in Houston! Hands Down! The food is very fresh and tasty! If you're a Mac n Cheese fan...you've got to try their Miso Lobster Mac n Cheese!! Scallop Foie Gras sushi was delectable. There's always multiple items on the fresh daily menu thats yumms!
