The Pit Room////With 6 people, we ordered a Feast No. 2 for $125 (supposed to feed 6-8). It came with around 3 lbs of meat with 6 or so different meats, which was great so everyone at the table could have some variety. It also came with 6 pieces of toast and 6 sides, which was great as everyone was about to get their fill of mac and cheese/slaw/potato salad. Unfortunately they only had around 5 options for sides, which felt kind of like a let down for variety.
