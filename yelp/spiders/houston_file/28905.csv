The Pit Room////Delicious brisket and beef rib! The service is fast and friendly! Bbq sauce has a wonderful tomato flavor with a nice tartness. The smoke pit is built into the building and you can see and smell the wood fire going! Definitely recommend the green beans which are super greasy and delicious!
