Local Foods////My second fave is the Banh Mi... I know what you're thinking. $10.50 for a banh mi?! This is not your typical banh mi thrown together for 3 bucks. Thit nuong is great but once you taste their complex, melt in your mouth, marinated pork... you will understand why it is worth what it's worth.
