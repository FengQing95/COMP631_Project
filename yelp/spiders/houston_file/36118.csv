Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was my first time coming to the Bosscat with some friends and I must say, I love love love this Bosscat burger the chefs way. A little much on the lettuce but it was absolutely amazing. The bartender Dan was amazing as well. I have never had a bartender that was actually interested in what kind of drinks I like. He did a great job of helping me select my drink. I have ordered several drinks but the best yet was the Irish Rose which Dan suggested and he hit my drink preference dead on. I would definitely come here again.
