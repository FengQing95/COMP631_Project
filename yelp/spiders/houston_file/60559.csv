Baby Barnaby's////Well, well, well, timing is everything. We got the last seat before a crowd rush. Yes, it's worth the wait but I'm thankful I didn't have to. Yummy to my tummy biscuits and YES I had a carb overload that was AMAZING.  Two biscuits met their fault quite quickly, up next the thick rind bacon cooked to perfection. Grits, and perfect eggs, and yes I had to try the potatoes as well (yum).  Ground coffee beans, fresh squeezed orange juice, and ice water in your own decanter. Yes I will pick another day during the week to visit this little gem. I hear weekends are crazy.
