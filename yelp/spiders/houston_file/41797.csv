Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Finally got a chance to have lunch here after a couple of failed attempts during previous visits to Houston.....the biggest barrier to enjoying lunch here is the inability to find a parking spot!   Definitely an indicator of the quality of the products served.   The Cuban sandwich is outstanding,  like nothing I've ever had in Florida...a place that prides itself on Cuban sandwiches.   The Nutella cupcake is good but I think I'd pass on dessert next time in favor of the sandwiches and amazing bread!
