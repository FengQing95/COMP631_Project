Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ended up ordering the raspberry pistachio tart (I love pistachio in any dessert), peanut butter chocolate cupcake, kugelhopf, and a baguette. I was in a hurry so I couldn't get any pictures of the cute cafe, but it's right in the heart of the city and the cafe is fun.
