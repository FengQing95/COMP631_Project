Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Then came the flight of whiskey. They have a whiskey bible that has toooons of different options to choose from. You can get a flight of whatever you want. They come as 1 oz pours which is plenty when you're just tasting. We got four different kinds. An Irish whiskey, which was my favorite, a Texas whiskey, a Louisiana whiskey, and a scotch. Yum yum.
