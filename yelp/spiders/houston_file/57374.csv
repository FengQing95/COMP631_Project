Kata Robata////Was so excited to share this establishment with out of town guests. Had reservations for a while to only find out they had given up gluten free options a couple of weeks ago without announcement. Waiter didn't care less and I was left waiting for the manager who never arrived. Definitely one less choice in Houston.
