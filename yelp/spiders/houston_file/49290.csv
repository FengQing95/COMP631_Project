Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came with some friends to try the place out and waited about an hour on  a Friday morning. We also ate for about an hour.  There is hardly any parking so you may need to park in the street or across the street in the lot if you get there and the parking lot is already full. Lots of space outside for people to sit around and wait and you can get drinks while you're waiting outside too.
