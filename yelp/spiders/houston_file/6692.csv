JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So, the ridiculous price of an alcoholic beverage and an awkward service from the wait staff keeps it from getting a 5. Had a waiter that was just all out of ramen to give. No excitement. No interest. Not even sure if he heard me the first time. I was excited! He kind of killed the excitement.I don't think he quite understood that his sell was part of his success as waitstaff. I got no sell. None. Just a "hi, my name is Blah, I'll be blahing you blah blah blah tonight. If you are lucky, I'll remember to bring you that iced tea you ordered." It was 6 weeks into service when we first arrived to Jinya, I think refinements will happen.
