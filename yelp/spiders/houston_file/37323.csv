Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've heard so many mixed reviews about BC, that I had to see for myself. So my friends and I decided to come Â for the Cavs and Celtics game. They offer valet services and has a private garage a stones throw away. We were seated immediately as we came during a sweet spot in their not yet so busy hours.
