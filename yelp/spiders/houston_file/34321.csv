Local Foods////The menu is made up of gourmet sandwiches, soups, salads and sides all made with as many locally sourced ingredients and produce as possible. I've been a longtime fan of benjy's Crunchy Chicken, and to think LF perfected it by sandwiching it between the softest homemade pretzel bun gives me the goosebumps. It's certainly a delightful sammie I've been craving since first bite. Another entree I enjoyed was the Arugula Salad: shrimp, cranberries, Texas honey pecans, pecorino with a lemon-thyme vinaigrette. Portions are big, options of soup/salad/side combos are endless, so anyone in your group will find something worth their while.
