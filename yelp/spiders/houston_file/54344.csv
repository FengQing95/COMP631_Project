Kata Robata////As for cooked food, I always enjoy looking at the daily (weekly?) specials to try out some newer items. They can be hit or miss sometimes but the experience has been mostly positive. Once I had an excellent toro steak that was overwhelmed by the saltiness of its sauce which I managed to scrape off. Their desserts are also inventive like the mung bean custard I had that was a delicious top off to a very expensive meal.
