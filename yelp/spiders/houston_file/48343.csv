Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Waited for a while to try this place due to the line out the door all the time. First of all the service was excellent by the servers. The food we ordered was bigger portion than expected. The prices are decent for the area. The taste of the burrito was nothing out of this world, good but not great. The peach jelly was amazing. I would definitely eat again based on service alone and to try something else.
