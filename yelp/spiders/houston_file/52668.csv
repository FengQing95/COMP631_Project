Kata Robata////This new restaurant of the Azuma, Soma family is the place to go for real sushi aficionados, not the run-of-the-mill sushi roll types.  I ordered the Chirashi and did not expect much.  I've had Chirashis in dozens of sushi restaurants around Houston, but this was the absolute best in town!  Not only was the presentation good, but the quality of the fish was of the highest grade.  The usually bland scallops were savory at Kata, the mackarel was moist, the yellow tail, tuna, snapper and salmon were incredibly fresh and melted in my mouth.  My friend had two of their meat dishes (I can't remember which ones), which did not disappoint.  I think I found my new favorite sushi restaurant.  I'm sorry Zen 5, you lost the title you had for many years.
