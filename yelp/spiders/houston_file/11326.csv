JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I apologize that you found the Spicy Tofu to be overly salty. Of the ingredients in the Spicy Tofu, it is the chili oil that is most salty, so it's surprising that even after the chef added much less chili oil to the second preparation, you still found it too salty. And we served dozens of Salmon Cilantro Sashimi dishes today, and no other customers cited any difference in taste of the ponzu sauce (citrus soy sauce). I can assure you that our recipe has not changed, but otherwise, I'm not sure how or why the dish might taste different.
