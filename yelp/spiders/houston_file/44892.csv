Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Where do I start? Cute, quaint, fabulous gooey chocolate cookies, desserts and their coffee....so yummy. Only had the chance to try their desserts and coffee, oh my it was good. You can taste the care that the pastry chef puts into creating those cookies. A must try! Also tried their cheesecake, it was ok, nothing outrageous. Definitely can't go without trying their coffee or any of their speciality coffees.
