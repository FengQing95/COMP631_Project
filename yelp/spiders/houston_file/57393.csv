Kata Robata////This roll was good. I liked the sweetness of it and the combination of the different types of tobiko for texture and flavor. The shrimp added a great crunch, but still had the sweetness of the fresh shrimp. It was good, but in terms of anything spectacular I would say it was not very unique.
