Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had brunch here at about 10AM on a Sunday with my parents and my wife.  We ordered quickly and the display of pastries was great.  We ordered a kougn aman and it was great.  Just what a sweet croissant should taste like.  I ordered the tamale Benedict and it was great.  Tangy sauce, with excellent tamales.  My wife ordered fried chicken and biscuit.  It was also great.  The gravy was very rich and porky and the chicken was seasoned well and lightly battered.
