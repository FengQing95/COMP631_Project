Uchi////Been here several times. This place is great. If you have a reservation, you may only wait 10 minutes or so for a table. Without a reservation, the wait can be pretty long (over an hour). The outdoor patio is a nice place to wait. Good drinks and sometimes they serve comped appetizers or sushi rolls for tastings as you wait. The nigiri is very fresh. The hot appetizers are delicious. Favorites are the walu walu and hamachi nabe. The brussel sprouts are incredible and addicting. It's pricey but worth it. The servers are friendly and explain every dish as they serve it.
