Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Dinner - ok, teeny demerit - I went for their Monday steak special and they were out.  Although, by the time I looked at the menu, I wasn't feeling steak so I am not heartbroken over that.  To be fair to them, steak was not on the regular menu, so I am sure they only order what they need, and I showed up at 9:00.  (They did offer a discount to anyone who ordered the steak special, which I think is WAY above and beyond).
