Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We each got the palomimosa, delicious and refreshing. The ham benedict was good as well. The eggs were flawlessly poached with the perfect amount of runniness. The ham was cooked to a nice crisp. My friend got Juan's breakfast tacos. It looked like a veggie salad on top of flour tortillas to me, not my cup of tea. You have to pay extra if you want to add any meat toppings.
