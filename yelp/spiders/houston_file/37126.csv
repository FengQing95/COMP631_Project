Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It took 20minutes for the server to greet us and take our drink order, and another HOUR for the food to come once we placed our order. Anyway when the food came, it was a disaster! We took one bite of the shrimp and grits and sent it back immediately- it tasked like... cream of wheat with tomato sauce on top *gags*. 3 of us ended up sending back our meals. I re-ordered and got avocado toast because I was starving at that point, but the other 2 people I was with just gave up and said they'd order food at the next stop of Sunday Funday.
