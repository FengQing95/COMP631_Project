Kata Robata////We ate here latish on a weeknight and had a mix of sushi, traditional rolls, specialty rolls and cold starters. I'd have to say they put a lot more effort into the (much higher priced) specialty rolls and starters than in the standard issue rolls and sushi. The hamachi and jalapenos sashimi was excellent, as was the special salmon sushi. The spicy tuna roll was only so-so, not bad but no better than some of the other 5 sushi restaurants in the 3 block area around them! Â Nice environment, people seemed to have a good time.
