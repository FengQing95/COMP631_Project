Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////PB&J/Salted Caramel Macarons- I saved the best for last. This is my absolute grown man weakness that confirms that I am just a man-child. I can not take a bite into a macaron without giggling and losing vision for seconds at a time. This was the crispiest macaron I have ever eaten and I've eaten many. The tasteful joining of PB&J into a macaron form could only be alluded to the marriage of Jay-Z and Beyonce. I was laughing and giggling so much that it caused someone by me to buy some themselves. A grown man in a tank, eating macarons and giggling in the middle of a bakery. Highlight of my month, Â Giggle points 10/10
