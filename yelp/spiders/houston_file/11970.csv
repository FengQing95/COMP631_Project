JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Maria - Thank you for your review. Can you tell me which ramen you ordered? We always encourage our guests to peruse our menu items carefully, especially for those who might have allergies, as our ingredients -- such as onions -- are listed. That said, if you're ever dissatisfied with our food in any way, we will do everything in our power to make things right, either by remaking the item or offering an alternative. Did you ask for a remake after you received your dish(es)?
