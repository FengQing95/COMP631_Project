Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went to Snooze at 10 AM on a Friday, thinking it wouldn't be too long of a wait since it's still in the work week, well I was wrong. We had a 30 minute wait and by the time we got seated at 10:30, it was an hour wait! (Makes me wonder about the weekend) They do offer free coffee while you wait in little orange planter like cups and have corn hole outside. You can also grab a drink at the bar if it's a Bloody Mary type of morning but there is very little waiting area inside. They have a system where they text you when it's ready instead of those buzzers that won't go off if you're too far away, so go search the as seen on tv section at cvs like we did!
