JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Janelle - Thanks for your great review. You are correct in your assessment of wait times during peak and off-peak hours. We do our best to keep the machine cogs turning in our restaurant, but there are limitations to how quickly we can prepare food, and more importantly, we advise accuracy over speed at all costs. But I'm glad you enjoyed our fare, and we appreciate your very kind words. We hope to serve you again the near future!
