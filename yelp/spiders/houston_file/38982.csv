Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm elated about their brunch menu!!! Every single item is great--well, at least the ones I've tried so far. Short rib chilaquiles are my favorite--a perfect, succulent portion! The pork belly tacos are great too, but a bit small. The bosscat fries are good, but their special sauce isn't anything special, can't tell much of a difference from regular ketchup... and their "fruity pebbles" French toast is a pretty nice treat too! I like the location and upbeat atmosphere, and staff is pretty nice. Can't wait to try them out for lunch!
