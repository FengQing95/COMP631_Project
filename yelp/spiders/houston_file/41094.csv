Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Really wanted to like this place more than I did. Went for breakfast with a friend and ordered two chorizo tortas, an orange juice, and two coffees. Our bill was $34 and the food was just OK. Nothing to rave about. We ordered the tortas without the chorizo.  I'm personally not a fan of chorizo anything, and I asked how spicy they might be since they list jalapeños as one of the ingredients. Counter girl assured me it was just a few picked jalapeños and not very spicy at all, just a bit of a kick. WRONG. We both had to remove them. Basically it was a very expensive egg sandwich. I guess their specialties are bread and pastries which we did not order. My friend has had their croissants and says they are to die for. Sadly, eating a croissant as big as my head is not on my bucket list. The coffee was good but very strong, so if that's not your preference then don't even bother at $5 a cup. We did get free refills. I noticed other reviewers saying they did not, but we did. The staff seem pretty bored with everyone and not overly pleasant.
