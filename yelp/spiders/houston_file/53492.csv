Kata Robata////On a bustling Friday night, we put our names down and waited by the small bar until our table was ready. It was crowded with people vying to place drink orders and several more having sat at the bar for their sushi. This area could do with some embiggening, especially if serving as a waiting room on busy nights. But we had a glass of wine from their rather paltry list, which I didn't particularly care for, but perhaps I should have been drinking sake.
