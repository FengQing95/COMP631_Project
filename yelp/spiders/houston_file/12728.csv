JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There's a bunch of options on the menu for what you want in your room such as chicken, beef, tofu, wonton, etc. I chose to get the spicy wonton Ramen with a boiled egg. The wonton was filled with pork or chicken I believe. The actual broth wasn't very spicy but I added some of the Ramen seasoning that was on the table and it made it very good.
