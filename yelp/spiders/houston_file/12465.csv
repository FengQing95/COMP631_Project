JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After having the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen, I kind of understand why this restaurant has such a good rating... IT'S THE BEST VEGAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD. The broth itself is already amazing; I thought vegetable broth would not be as tasty as Tonkotsu (Pork Broth), but I was wrong!
