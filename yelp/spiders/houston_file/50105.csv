Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This location isn't too large so depending on the time you come expect a longgg wait (up to 1 hr). For starters, they have complementary coffee while you wait. The menu seemed pretty good; there was sweet stuff and savory stuff to fulfill everyone's mood. The shrimp and grits had a great flavor. They used ground sausage which was something new but it was really good. The upside down pineapple has a unique cinnamon butter and a nice flavor and sweet cream sauce.
