JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite Ramen place!! Better than all other ramen places I've been too, including NYC Ippudo and some california joints. I've been here more than 10 times. I'm a ramen fanatics!! Each time, they never fail to deliver the best quality ramen. Broth is on the thick side (pork broth for Tonkotsu which I like).
