JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I like things as hot as they go since I am on an endless search for The Merciless Pepper of Quetzalacatenango, and nothing really delivers a hot heat experience like I want. I am a true spicehound. I asked the waitress to make this as hot as they could. It was not hot. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this a 2. Agu Ramen's hottest level (which the GM gave me an explicit warning about before agreeing to provide it to me) looking atomic red was maybe a 4 if I was being generous. So Agu Ramen makes 'hot' hotter than Jinya does, but neither makes it hot enough to matter on the heat index alone. When I order something hot I expect it to hurt so it is my mistake to expect something hot enough for me to take notice.
