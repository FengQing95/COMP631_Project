Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Words cannot begin to explain how saddened and dismayed I was after reading your review. We pride ourselves on our ability to provide high quality food, drinks, and service to all of our guests in a truly unique environment. This is truly what brunch is about and had always made it my favorite day of the week. The maui meatloaf had always been a crowd favorite and an item we brought back to our menu due to the popular demand. I am so sorry you did not have a better experience during your visit as it is clear to me we well short on both items you tried. I would like to make this up to you. Have you tried our dinner menu? I would love to invite you back in to have dinner for two on me. Please let me know and I will personally make your reservation for a day and time of your choosing. I truly hope you give us another chance And I promise you will not be disappointed. I hope to hear from you soon.
