JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nia - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy our ramen, though I should mention we have more than a dozen types of ramen bowls to choose from, and not every dish is going to be a homerun, depending on your preferences. We're always happy to swap out a selection if it fails to meet your expectations.
