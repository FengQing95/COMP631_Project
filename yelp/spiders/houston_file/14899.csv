JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The BEST ramen spot in Houston. Really nice ambience. Amazing ramen, and even better when you ask them to make it spicy! Vegetarian and vegan options as well. The vegan creamy ramen is amazing -- even if you're not vegan you should try it! I would highly recommend the shrimp tempura with spicy mayo as well. The service is very good.
