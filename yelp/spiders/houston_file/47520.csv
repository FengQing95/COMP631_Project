Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So I finally got the chance to try out snooze and it was really good. This place was so crowded the line was out the door. The decoration is really comfy and cute guess what you'd expect from a hip brunch spot. I started off with a spicy bloody Mary and it was really good and they also try the sour apple margarita that was really good as well. Now moving onto the food, I went with the Benny Duo. One of my eggs Benedict was Â chilaquiles with pulled pork and the other was Salmon. Both flavors offered something very different in their own both really good. I also tried a plain pancake but there's nothing to write home about it really. We stayed at the bar the service was great the waitstaff was really attentive. Waiting on a table it was about a two hour wait so that's why we stayed at the bar. Other than that really nice brunch spot!
