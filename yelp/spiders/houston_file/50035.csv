Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I visited Snooze this morning for my birthday with my best friend. We showed up right when they opened and were greeted with smiles and enthusiasm. Everyone was so friendly and they even sent us two free pancakes so we could try their favorites :) I've been to Snooze before (on a busy Saturday morning) and enjoyed it, but this time takes the (birthday) cake! Delicious food and awesome staff!
