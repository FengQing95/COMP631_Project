Kata Robata////The decor was nice and new and there wasn't a single TV in the place which is something I can appreciate but I know the guys were getting a little squeemish. As far as service, we got a good amount of attitude from the waitress but I didn't really mind, I felt it truly completed my experience of going to a trendy sushi restaurant.
