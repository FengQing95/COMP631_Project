Local Foods////My best friend and I swapped halves of our sandwiches so that we could try each one. That's the beauty of eating with more people! I think I actually enjoyed her bagel more than my sandwich. I love smoked salmon so it was definitely a winner. Keep in mind though, these sandwiches seemed pretty gigantic. I might share one sandwich with a friend next time I come back instead of ordering my own.
