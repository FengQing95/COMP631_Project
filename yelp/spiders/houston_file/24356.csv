Uchi////We went there for my husband's birthday celebration and opted for the omakase dinner menu. The menu consisted of small plates based on our palate throughout the night and everything was divine!! Best of all, we had a vegetarian friend and she was accommodated with a vegetarian omakase menu as well.
