Local Foods////Salt+pepper roast beef sandwich: Mediocre. I like simple roast beef and cheddar sandwiches a lot. The many veggies in this sandwich dilute down the sharp, savory flavors of meat and cheese into a mushy, weak sandwich. The curried cauliflower does not have a very strong curry flavor; the blandness makes the cauliflower just seem like flavorless filler.
