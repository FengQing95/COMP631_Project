JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Just ok. Ambiance inside was nice. It was super weird how both hostesses seemed to have an issue with seating me before ABSOLUTELY CONFIRMING that my "party-of-2" are both present (my husband was smoking outside so I entered first to ask for a table). I thought maybe the place was packed, but there were plenty of available seating inside .
