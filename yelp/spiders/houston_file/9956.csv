JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the tonkatsu spicy ramen with medium spice. The broth was so deliciously rich and with tons of depth in flavor. It didn't come with an egg but thankfully my bf didn't want the one that came with his jinya black tonkatsu ramen so I happily devoured it. The egg was perfectly cooked with an exceptionally creamy yolk that went perfectly with the spicy broth. The thick noodles that came with the dish had a nice chewiness to them.
