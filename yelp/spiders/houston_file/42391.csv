Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////While visiting Houston, I made it a point to come to this place (the friend I stayed with also told me it was a must in H-town). I think that the concept behind Common Bond is enough to get me to come, and showing up on a Sunday afternoon, only to find out all of the brunch items had sold out, is a good indication of the level of popularity.
