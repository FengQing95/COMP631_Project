Local Foods////If you've never been here, you MUST get the crunchy chicken sandwich because there are times that I will literally just crave this specific sandwich. This is the only sandwich I ever thought was worthy of delivery. The chicken is tender and moist, they add house made chips for crunch, and they have a great sauce that doesn't make the sandwich soggy. The bread is a high quality fluffy bun. How did they manage to make a sandwich that's both delicious and healthy?
