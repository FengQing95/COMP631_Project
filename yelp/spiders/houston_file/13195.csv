JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I showed up in the early afternoon on a Sunday, and there was a 30-minute wait.  We decided to sit at the front bar instead,  I ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen (pork broth, pork chaschu, spicy bean sprouts, kikurage, green onion, and thick noodles) w/ extra corn and garlic.  The name held true, as it was quite spicy.  Will definitely be going back.  I am VERY happy to have a ramen place in the area that closes late at 11 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and at 2 a.m. Friday-Saturday!
