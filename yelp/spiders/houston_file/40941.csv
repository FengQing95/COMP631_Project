Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great place for a casual lunch! I ordered the 12 hour Beef Short Rib, and it was mouthwateringly good. The short rib was so tender and melted in my mouth, and I especially loved how they cut the scalloped potatoes into thin rectangles. The barbecue sauce they used for the beef was sweet and delicious, and I liked how the sauce seeped through to the potatoes underneath the short ribs as well Service was just average; the waitress just came by to take our order and give us the bill. If you are willing to go spend the money, I would recommend giving the short ribs a try!
