Local Foods////The shrimp and crab sandwitch is amazing.  I believe all of the food is locally purchased and very fresh.  The soup was excellent as well.  It always seems to be moderately busy, but not crazy busy.  Probably the best thing on the menu is the side order of kale.  It has little raisin things in it and I think it is the best kale I have ever had.  I highly recommend this local restaurant which is near West University.
