Kata Robata////Right off the bat I'll tell you that the Kobe beef skewers is the number 1 item of the night. The only drawback is the stupid pesto sauce they bring alongside it that does absolutely nothing for the beef other than make it oily (and it's kobe beef so the fat content is already stupidly fat enough, why add more fat?). The flavor of the beef is fantastic and the texture was layered, as if I was eating really good pork belly where the layers are distinguishable yet doesn't hinder the tenderness of the meat.
