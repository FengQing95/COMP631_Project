Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a rapidly expanding Colorado-based breakfast chain with a large space and an even larger menu. I've heard tales of long waits, but on a December Tuesday before 10 am we had no such problem. They have a 50s diner theme, but it's pretty corporate looking and I wasn't digging the color scheme.
