Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was very good, loved the hashbrowns and the inside of the place is really cool. One thing I was not happy about was being charged $4.00 for one glass of orange juice! I could go buy a half gallon for less than that! My meal was a little over $9 and OJ shouldn't cost that much! Walked out of there paying $17 with tip. That's high for breakfast if you ask me!
