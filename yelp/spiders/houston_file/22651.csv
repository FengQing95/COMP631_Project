Uchi////Uchi has spectacular food, spectacular atmosphere, and spectacular service. If you're not sure what to order, the staff will always help get you the best meal according to what your tastes are. I'm usually a picky eater, but these are some of my favorite dishes, Hana tataki, akami te, Hama chilli, and spicy crunchy tuna.
