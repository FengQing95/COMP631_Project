Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Worst service I've ever received by a person in a restaurant. First I ordered online as I've done several times over the last couple of months @840 and scheduled pick up for 915. Arrive at 910, told food will be a few more moments and it will be brought out to my truck. 25 minutes later no food. Went into the restaurant and told it will be even longer! So I ask for a refund and it was said out loud, "I don't have time for this!" And I was passed off to another employee! Â Ms. Maria Lopez (GM) please contact me I'd like your explanation of why your employee is so rude. Thanks for ruining my wife Mother's Day brunch!
