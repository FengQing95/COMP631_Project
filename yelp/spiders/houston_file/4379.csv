JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am a FAN of this place! I have been twice now and not disappointed at all. Even with the 30 minute wait, it was completely worth it! For about 12-15 bucks you get an amazingly seasoned, delicious bowl of ramen. I am typically STUFFED after and happy lol. We also got the pork Gyoza and Jinya bun and both were so good! I get my ramen with pork (Tonkotsu Spicy) and I'm dancing just thinking about it! I say go and see what they hype is about because this is my top ramen place!
