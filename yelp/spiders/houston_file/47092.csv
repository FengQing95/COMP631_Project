Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was definitely surprised to find out this restaurant originated in Colorado first of all. We were immediately seated but the waitress took about 35 minutes to just take our drink order and by that time we were ready to order our plates. She apologized and said it was due to their shift change and it's usually not like that. We ordered the chilaquiles Benedict and omg! French toast. Both very delicious plates even though the service wasn't on point, and that's why I gave it 3 stars
