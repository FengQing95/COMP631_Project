Local Foods////For my side dishes, I usually get a double portion of their cabbage slaw. It has tofu bits and edamame inside, so the vegan in me is very happy! I'm actually very pleased that now they even have a vegan potato salad. I love restaurants that cater to all customers! Thank you, Local Foods, for not excluding vegan Houstonians!!
