Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered a simple (smash) cake and 12 cupcakes as a custom order for my daughters first birthday. Working with their contact for custom cakes was such a pleasure. She was so professional, and was so easy to work with through email. When they first told me to call their custom cakes contact, I was concerned my order was too small and not important (they also do wedding cakes). However I received a response within a day or two of contacting them, and the order was seamless. I even ordered the week of the event!
