The Pit Room////Ok, now the sides! I'd read the previous reviews about the beans and the mac and cheese so I decided to get those. The beans were so good! They aren't your typical over salted charro beans. They were addicting! They had an amazing flavor with cilantro, bacon, and a bit of brisket perhaps. I wish we would've gotten more. Moving on to the Mac and cheese...I think if they sold the stuff by the tub I'd be the first in line. It's seriously the BEST mac and cheese I've ever had. Liquid gold y'all! Seriously, you will not be disappointed with the meats or sides. Start packing your stuff up now and head over.
