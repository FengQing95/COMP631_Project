Uchi////The bad: The first three maki that came out (avo with yuzu kosho and fried shallot, negihama, sake) were all soggy.  The nori was inedible to my mom who spit it out.  We informed the server after our second roll that the maki was not crunchy or fresh tasting, and the server replaced my mom's plate multiple times since it has chewed and spit out nori on it - clearly she knew there was an issue.  She claimed it was the travel time from the bar to the table and that rice and nori naturally sog up upon touch, but I have eaten at all other Uchi locations and know this was not up to par.  I also eat sushi on the regular and have been to Japan three times, so I know that a few seconds from bar to table could not mean chewy and inedible seaweed.  We also never received ginger, wasabi, soy sauce or sauce dishes for it.  We had to ask for soy sauce and it took awhile to come out.
