Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I dream about their meatloaf sandwich all the time. It's a very interesting twist on any meat loaf sandwich I've ever seen and makes you think about it for days. Common bond has a small but great selection of dishes, and a bakery to die for. The restaurant is a little crowded but it's fun and they have private tables and then the long tables where you can share w other guests. As long as it stays the same I will keep coming back!
