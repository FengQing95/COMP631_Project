Local Foods////Sides: I have had the beets (okay, but definitely only for beet lovers), kale (awesome, get this every time, forever was the only way i would eat kale), Asian cabbage slaw (my favorite side, could eat an entire entre sized salad of this if I could), barley (excellent, even though I'm not that into grains, sweet and pickle like at the same time), acorn squash (if you love curry, you will love this!), potato chips (I love these, because they are super seasoned, but someone I was eating with thought they were too spicy).
