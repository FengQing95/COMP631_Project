The Pit Room////Great place for BBQ, especially brisket. Line typically isn't that long during the week though on the weekends it can be longer. Plenty of place to sit over on the patio at the bar next door. The brisket is exceptional, in my opinion top 3 in Texas. Also the sides are really good. I recommend the elote if they have it.
