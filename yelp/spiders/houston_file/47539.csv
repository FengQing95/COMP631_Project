Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is amazing. I cannot say the same for the wait time. Be prepared to wait 45min to an hour, no matter the time of day you go. Also, you cannot (only if you're lucky) call in to go orders because their phone is always down. I brought it to their attention and their response was "yea that happens", and that was that. Poor customer service if you ask me.
