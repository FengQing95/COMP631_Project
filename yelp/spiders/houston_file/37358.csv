Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambiance here is amazing. The restrooms alone, gorgeous. Everything is high-end and custom from the purse hooks under the bar to the monogram bar stools. But I have to say the most amazing experience here was, well, the FRIES. Seriously, order these, they will transform your very reality by redefining what fried potato should taste like. Everything else's was good - we had short rib and the pulled pork but they were both way too heavy. A smaller portion of meet balanced with some veg would be most welcome. Otherwise, the whole waitstaff at one point or another stopped by and we were well taken cared of. Yum. Would come here again.
