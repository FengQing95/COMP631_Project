Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Trendy and stylish corner that used to be an old victorian house! The architectural artsy invites the coffee and deserts enthusiasts. The staff are helpful and friendly. Clean, nice and well organized interior compliments the simple yet elegant decors with their own products. The Â marhjari (pardon if i mispelled it) moccha is the bomb if you like rich sugar daddy ooops i meant rich mocha drink! Deliciously blended! The OJ freshly squeezed from the fruit and really great! Coconut caramel verrine is a must try! Will recommend and will love to come back!
