Uchi////Excellent place loved the food , very different and we ended up ordering all the deserts and all four of them were delicious. So definitely keep room for dessert. I ordered the avocado bake it domes with crab meat, was delicious and healthy. It was almost an hour wait on a Friday night but it was worth it.
