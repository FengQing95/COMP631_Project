Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I noticed a complaint about the price of the drinks.  I have to be honest, I don't live in Houston, so I don't know what market price is around here.  Honestly, I think most of the craft cocktails at Del Frisco's are in that same range, and this was certainly no Del Frisco's.   But, I do not think $14 for a craft cocktail was unreasonable.
