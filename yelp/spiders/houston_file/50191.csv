Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, if you *REALLY* want to eat at Snooze, you might want to think about setting your alarm for 7am because by 8am, their wait time is generally around 15-20 minutes already and by 9am, FAHGET ABOUT IT. By 9am, their wait time can run upwards of 1-1.5 hours, sometime even 2 hours, and it basically stays that way until closing... You have the option to be on their waitlist and they will text you when the table is ready, but really? Are you seriously going to wait that long for a table at a restaurant? You could've eaten breakfast in that time and started doing something more productive with your day. But to each their own. Humans do nothing but wait for things most of our lives anyway, haha.
