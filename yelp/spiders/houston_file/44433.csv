Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love common bond, but the quality of coffee is not as good specially if you order a to go latte. Take out customers are not less valued customers as sit in customers. When I get latte the texture of milk is so important to me. This the picture of a very foamy milk rather a silky milk. I still will go the place thought.
