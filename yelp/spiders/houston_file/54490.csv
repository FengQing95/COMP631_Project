Kata Robata////By now I have been at Kata Robata numerous times.  The 2 stars at Kata are Chef Manabu Horiuchi (aka Hori-San) and Chef Philippe Gaston.  The combination of these 2 brings an amazing variety of dishes, from some of the best Chirashi bowls in Houston to a unique Surf 'n' Turf made with a Snapper collar and fried chicken in a light batter and Indian spices.  The last meal I had there also included a heirloom tomato and jelly fish salad which had an amazing flavor and texture.
