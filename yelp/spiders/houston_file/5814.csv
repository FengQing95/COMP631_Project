JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A friend recommended this place and to my surprise it is actually very close to my place. The first time we came here, it was a 30 minute wait for a table, I believe this was either a Saturday or Sunday early afternoon. We decided to sit at the bar since we were very hungry. I ordered one of their specials, I really wish I could remember what the name was because I really liked it!! Ever since I came back a few times, they didn't have that special anymore... I have tried other ramen since then and for some reason I still like Tiger Den better... I think I just need to find my go-to ramen at Jinya in order for me to appreciate this place more. Regardless, this is a go-to place for my bf and I since it is close by and it is open late on Friday and Saturday night. Also, he thinks this is the best ramen place in Houston, if that helps. Another thing I like about Jinya is that they offer combination meals so you can get a ramen bowl + salad + small appetizer. We usually get one combination for both of us to share and we really like the crispy chicken and salad. One other thing to note is that we did not realize that the restaurant closes at 11pm on weekdays and so we got there probably 15 mins before they closed, but they were more than happy to serve us. I felt really bad but also appreciated the nice customer service.
