JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered JINYA tonkotsu black. The broth was great, I can taste the porkiness and lots of umami flavor. It has just the right amount of salt as well. I ordered mine with thick noodles, which I like better for its chewiness. Two things that were a slight let down: I requested my broth to be piping hot (how I like my soup) - and they didn't deliver. Also their egg (tamago) didn't have runny yolk. It might just be their style, but I miss that ooey gooey soy-flavored yolk in my soup.
