Kata Robata////At the end of our meal, our alarm went off at the house. The waitress (blonde asian gal with dark glasses?) had been very attentive and nice throughout the night, and she came by shortly after and I told her we had to rush out to check on the house. Within 60 seconds, She had brought our receipt, took my card, charged it, and brought it back. I really appreciated her expediting that for us, and enjoyed the service. My perfect level: Attentive, polite, but casual.
