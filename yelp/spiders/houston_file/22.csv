Local Foods////I love sandwiches and this place is sandwich heaven!  I also love veggies, so I loved all the veggie sides to choose from.  I had the egg salad sandwich because of all the great reviews and it was more delicious than I could have ever hoped for!  The truffle oil and the soft, warm pretzel bread really put this sandwich on a totally different level!  If you're used to typical deli-style egg salad sandwiches on Mrs. Baird's, this is not that.  For sides I had the beets and the white beans.  The dill and bacon pieces in the white beans added such wonderful flavor.  The beets were awesome too.  I did sneak in a bite of my husband's pastrami and it was also melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  Seriously, if you love a REALY good sandwich, I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other sandwiches and sides.  :)
