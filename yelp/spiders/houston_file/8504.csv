JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really cool ramen place overall. Had the spicy pork ramen and loved it, especially with the thick noodles. Went ahead and ordered extra noodles and man did I make the right call. Takoyaki for appetizer was also suoer good. Great vibes and great food, would recommend to any ramen fan.
