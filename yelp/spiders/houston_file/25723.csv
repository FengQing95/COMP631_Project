Uchi////Tried the vegetarian omakase and it might have been the best meal I've ever had. It was my first time trying sushi, so i didn't know what to expect, but I was blown away. Every single item the chef prepared was delicious with unique flavor combinations and unlike anything i've tasted. The servers were very attentive, promptly filling water glasses, bringing out new plates, and explaining what each dish is. The ambiance is also very beautiful and has an expensive feel to it.
