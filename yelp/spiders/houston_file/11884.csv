JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Robyn - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen, and we appreciate your great photos. We flash boil our bok choy and then place it in an ice bath to keep its integrity. We understand that's not how everyone enjoys this topping, but this is how we are instructed to cook and serve this item. Nevertheless, we thank you for your kind words, and we hope you'll visit us again soon.
