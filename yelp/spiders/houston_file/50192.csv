Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was great, but ye gods, the wait was bad. They wouldn't let us call ahead to put our name down and told us we had show up to get on the list. The wait was over an hour long, and due to the number of people waiting there wasn't space inside to pass the time. So we ended up outside in the heat and humidity for a good hour. Thankfully they have water and coffee available for free for those waiting. Alternatively, you can try to jostle and fight for a spot at the bar when a seat opens up, as it was open seating.
