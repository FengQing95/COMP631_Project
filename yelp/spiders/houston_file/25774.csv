The Pit Room////New favorite bbq place in town!  Just enjoyed brisket and turkey for 115 catered by the Pit Room!  Everyone couldn't stop talking about how good it all was!  The brisket was falling apart.  The turkey was juicy which is rare for smoked turkey!  Amazing!  They also made us 3 different stuffings.  oyster stuffing, chorizo stuffing, and sage and sausage traditional stuffing.  Wow!  They went above and beyond for us and will be getting more business from us in the future!  Lots more!  My favorite when eating there for lunch are their brisket and chicken tacos!  Absolutely amazing!  Nothing like them anywhere!
