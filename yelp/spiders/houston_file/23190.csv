Uchi////With each new dish we were blown away by the flavors. The thing that I noticed and really appreciated, making my dining experience even more enjoyable is that each dish complimented the one previous. Like when we had a spicy dish the next was would be mellow but still packed with flavor. We loved how each dish was explained to us, what was in it and how to eat it, because sometimes instructions are required.
