Baby Barnaby's////Back to my favorite meal, since I first had it, I don't think I've ordered another breakfast at any of the Barnaby's locations. The dish I speak of is the Green Eggs!  This is breakfast perfection on a plate. The dish gets its name from you guessed it, green eggs. It's 2 eggs with artichokes and spinach with a touch of jack cheese. It's always nice and creamy oh so tasty. It comes with the best breakfast potatoes you will ever have and a slice of toast or biscuits. The serving sizes are huge and you will not leave hungry. I always order some of their fresh squeezed OJ to wash it down.  I've tried bites of some of their other stuff and it's always good as well, but I can't stay away from my favorite.
