Baby Barnaby's////First the good: it was a good breakfast, endless good coffee. Now the bad: provocatively atrocious service with a smile. We got there at 10 AM on a Sunday, and were prepared for a long wait. It's a small place and apparently popular among the locals. So much so that two pairs behind us on the waiting list were called up before us, adding another 10 minutes to an already long wait. We were quickly able to make our orders and were looking forward to our meals. For another 45 Minutes, even as three couples who came in after us were served first. One couple that came in just after us were greeted by name, had received their breakfasts, paid and left a good five minutes before our order arrived. The message these travelers got?
