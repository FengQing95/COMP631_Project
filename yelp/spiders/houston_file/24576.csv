Uchi////So I went for my birthday right when they opened at 5pm on a Saturday. I had a party of 7 and so I knew that it would be hard to get in and so I made a reservation 2 months in advance. I know that is excessive but Christmas/NY time is busy and so the reservation made the whole process SO MUCH easier.
