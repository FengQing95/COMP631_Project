JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Once the bowl arrived, I went about my usual process. Appearance? Reasonable. Broth? Creamy and flavorful, but not too salty. My anticipation rose, but then I took a big bite of the ramen noodles and was instantly disappointed. They lack the chewiness I expect from quality ramen. This made it difficult to fully embrace the rest of my meal, although I'll admit they make a deliciously seasoned soft-boiled egg.
