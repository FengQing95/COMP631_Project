Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Had lunch there yesterday and it was awful. I had tomatoe basil soup that tasted nothing like tomatoes and more like pumpkin. The brussel sprouts were drenched in honey.  They had run out of the croissant with hard sugar on bottom, can't remember name.  Sandwich was boring!!! Meat between 2 pieces of bread.  Could have made that at home. Too small of a space and too loud.
