JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of the only downsides to the restaurant is that they do not accept reservations. A wait for a table can be anywhere from a few minutes to about 30-40 minutes. They have a nice bar in the front where you can get a drink. We had a group of 6 that was seated fairly quickly (although my friends wouldn't agree since they had to wait on me and my boyfriend) in an intimate corner table. Even before looking at the menu, we did Sake bombs which are always fun and messy. They have a good list of sake so we had ordered two bottles while waiting for our meal.
