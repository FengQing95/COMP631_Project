Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is so good but I'm really tired of getting such poor service. Every time I come I hope the service will be better, but again today I was disappointed. The culture of the staff is one of cockiness and an attitude of treating the customer as a nuisance. There are many places to get breakfast around the Montrose area without the wait staff treating you as "...you should be so lucky to eat here."
