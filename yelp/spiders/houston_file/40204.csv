Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've heard so many great things about Bosskat brunch. Unfortunately, I was only able to sneak away for lunch. But, I can't wait to go back and try out that brunch menu. The only specials were on the back of the menu and didn't sound super interesting to me. I opted for the corn chowder because it was a little chilly. Hm. It was good, but I was expecting sweet and not savory. So there's that. Decent parking situation, but I've seen it get bad in that area. Like I said, I'll be back.
