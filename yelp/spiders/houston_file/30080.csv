The Pit Room////However, even after I finally got the meat that definitely had been sitting on the side for a bit, I was quite disappointed. Though smokey, the meat was also somehow tough and fatty at the same time. How can brisket be tough AND fatty? The ribs didn't do much better. There was little meat on the bones, and the ribs definitely tasted a bit dried out like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. What a let down! IMO, go try another place if you want good Texas BBQ, because The Pit Room certainly isn't it!
