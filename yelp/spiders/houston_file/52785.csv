Kata Robata////The decor is nice. Typical of what you find in any trendy sushi joint. My boyfriend and I had reservations and were promptly seated upon our arrival. We had one waitress and then 10 minutes later had another (the second one was late getting to work due to some long-winded story I stopped listening too shortly after she started) and she was annoy-ing! Overly perky and kept asking us if we enjoyed every single dish she brought out. I don't know about most but I prefer to be left somewhat alone when I eat out. Particularly on a date with my boyfriend. Anyhow, on to the food...
