Uchi////Some dishes that I haven't tried that other people love: Ham and Eggs Makimono - people are obsessed with this one.  It seems to be a must-order roll for almost all my friends, and it's on the social hour menu.  Also, I've never tried to the Jar Jar Duck, but my sister loves it.  She also loves to complain about the price of it.
