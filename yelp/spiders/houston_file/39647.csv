Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had thoroughly stalked the menu soon after making reservations and was excited to try the chicken fried steak and gumbo! Two things I absolutely love. However, the waiter came back shortly to tell us that there was only one chicken fried steak left and was wanting to know which one of us wanted it. My friend, being the gentleman that he is offered it to me and ordered chilaquiles instead. However...the waiter came back again and said in the time it took us to decide someone else took the last chicken fried steak...well the question in my head was why hadn't he just put it in in the beginning then asked us?
