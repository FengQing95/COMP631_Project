Baby Barnaby's////We have spent a lot of time in Houston bouncing in between breakfast spots.  Among our efforts have been Empire Cafe (reputed to be excellent, but not), Brasil (good and close but loud), Benjy's (way too much food for breakfast), Diner 59 (eh) and others.  Baby's Barnaby's, though, is the real article.  Even with the often interminable waits, the excellent service and the better than excellent food pay off in the end.  I am especially enamored with the biscuits currently, though gorging myself on any of the food is guaranteed to brighten up my day.  Special fun was dining at gay-friendly Barnaby's the day after New York legalized same sex marriage -- even this heterosexual couple felt part of the fun.
