The Pit Room////The Brisket was outstanding. Ordered moist and came out with good bark and perfect pink smoke ring. The rib was a little dry / tuff but had a dark bark , sausage was cedar cheese with jalapeños not to hot and juicy. Friendly staff , they just need more eating area.  I would recommend the Brisket.
