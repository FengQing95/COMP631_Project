JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Visited JINYA for the second time, first for my boyfriend, after hearing so many great things about it online and from friends. Wait time on Sunday around 1pm was nonexistent. We ordered pop stickers, octopus balls, susiyaka(?)Q Ramen, and chicken ramen. The pop stickers were chewy and we found 3 tiny pieces of bone. They are so much better at Akashi Fusion Bar in Summerwood area. The octopus balls were good. The ramen on the other hand was definitely not worth the hype. We have been to many places in Houston, Izakaya being the best, and these thin noodles did not taste right. They leave a weird aftertaste and taste just like Ramen in a cup from the grocery store. The broth was okay, but has a flour like taste. Most ramen places we have visited have various toppings included in the ramen bowl, but this place was lacking taste and more ingredients. Definitely don't plan on ever visiting again. Paid too much for the quality of this food then again the location may factor in. This is just our honest personal opinion.
