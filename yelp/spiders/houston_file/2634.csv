JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As mentioned earlier, the ramen was less than impressive. I got the tonkatsu black and in the description a "seasoned egg" was listed. I get my bowl and I'm thinking hmm in what form is this seasoned egg. Well it was non-existent as I did not have one. I ask my friend and it's suppose to be a boiled egg seasoned some how. I ask the waitress and she brings me one on the side. I take a bite to see what the hoopla is about and it seemed like it was just a boiled egg dipped in soy sauce and finished with sesame oil. Not sure if that was what it actually was but still not bad anyways. The ramen was not overly salty, as it normally is traditionally. They list the ingredients on all of their ramen types (I think they had 6). Again, it was decent and I would eat here again, but I'll try some others before I potentially find my way back. Our friend who said it was the best ramen ever, well, DID NOT DELIVER ON THAT STATEMENT.
