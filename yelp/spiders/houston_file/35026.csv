Local Foods////Quinoa burger? Heaven on earth. I don't know where I can find a place like this in Atlanta but if I can't find one I will be back in Houston for this one LOL. I love that the burger came on a pretzel bun. Definitely something different. I had local food two times the first time I had it with chips and the curry pumpkin seeds. Wasn't really a fan of it. The chils were hard and the pumpkin seeds were just off. Too many to be a meal and not an ideal snack. The second time I had it with two sides of watermelon &  on a day where it was 98°, that watermelon tasted like heaven. Definitely give this place a try.
