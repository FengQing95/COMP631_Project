Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Annoyance 1 - Head to the left of the bar, this is where you can order drinks. However, there is no distinct line (there is a very small sign that says "order drinks here". People cut in front of you and pretty much walk into the bar back area to flag down a bar tender. The bar tenders are so busy they don't care and will serve whoever aggressively gets their attention first. So those who thought we were in line - wrong! People cut, no one cares. It's mass chaos. However, me being a loud mouth spoke up when I saw a woman weaseling her way past me into the Â the bar back area, then giving her order. I got the bartenders attention and she quickly took my order.
