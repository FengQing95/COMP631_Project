Uchi////I don't know where to start this restaurant is at the head of the class as far as fresh and delicious sushi. Food was rich, savory and very nicely presented. The ambiance is soothing while hip, with a memorable sophisticated interior design.  Service was excellent. Definitely worth the visit.  Would go back to expand the experience further!
