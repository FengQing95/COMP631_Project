Uchi////The best sushi experience I've come across in Texas. Been more than a handful of sushi restaurants in Houston and Austin, and this one leads the pack. That being said, this is mainly due to the cooking staff at the bar. They really brought out fun, care, enthusiasm, in our experience with personality & chemistry within their work. Kaleb & Tree, and the guys were amazing, and I can't express how much fun it was dinning with them These are the kind of dining experiences you look for on a celebratory type of night. Truly grateful
