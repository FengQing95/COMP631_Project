Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had our wedding welcome/rehearsal dinner at Bosscat on April 30, and they went above and beyond. First off, the manager PJ hosted a tasting the week before where we got to try different things. He was so kind and accommodating, and helped us choose our perfect menu.
