Uchi////Uchi's new Houston location is located in a beautifully adapted classic Mexican restaurant (Felix's) on Westheimer. The renovation is gorgeous, keeping the iconic shape of the arched entry and riffing on it with concrete, metal and wood. There is a patio out front that is pleasantly sheltered from the traffic on Westheimer. Free valet parking in back.
