Local Foods////LOVE THIS PLACE SO DELICIOUS and I feel so gulit-free because it's so healthy. It's a nice little place within a condo or apartment complex. The scene outside is very chill and nice. They staff is very nice. There is almost no wait when we ordered our foods which is awesome. So many varieties I love it all. If you love true food kitchen then you will love this place. Same vibe and pricing about the same depending what you get.
