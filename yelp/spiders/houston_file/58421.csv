Baby Barnaby's////Okay, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  I went on a Wednesday morning, and was seated right away.  The service was good, but I didn't think the food was anything to write home about.  I had the migas with chorizo and an iced tea.  It was just....uninspired.  The potatoes seemed processed (from the frozen foods aisle); I doubt they are homemade.  I wouldn't come back here.  I also don't like super cramped spaces, and Baby Barnaby's is nothing if not cramped.  The other people there were super nice to me, as an out of towner, so yeah for Montrose and for Houston, but BB's...meh.
