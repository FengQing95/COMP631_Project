Kata Robata////Wow. For only $9 you get this amazing udon. The noodles are cooked perfectly. It tastes very clean - definitely not over-seasoned or over-salted. The spinach also tastes very clean - probably just thrown in there raw. The mushrooms and green onion are what give most of the flavor. We had the tempura on the side so that might have affected the taste a little but hopefully not that much. Would like it if it had a bit more salt to it. Tempura are fall apart in mouth fresh of course.
