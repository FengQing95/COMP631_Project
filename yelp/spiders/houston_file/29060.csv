The Pit Room////Kind of snobbish about food, including BBQ so apologies ahead of time.  To give you perspective, my opinions are that Hometown in NYC has the best overall including the beef rib, Franklins in Austin has the best brisket.  What I'll give Killens is they have good pork ribs, but that's about it sadly.
