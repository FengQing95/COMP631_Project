Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hash Browns were so incredibly flavorful. The breakfast pot pie was so good. The sausage gravy had a nice peppery, rich taste, and the pie crust was flaky. I was a little bit disappointed in the mimosa because it didn't taste strong enough, but I can look past that because our server was so friendly. I had a good experience here. I went on a Wednesday for brunch, the wait time was only 10min, and the food came out promptly. There's limited parking in the adjacent lot, so your best bet is parking somewhere on the side streets.
