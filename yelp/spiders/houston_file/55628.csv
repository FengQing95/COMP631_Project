Kata Robata////Tuna Tar Tar($9): This is the very first thing we always order.  We have to order 2 since my 11-year-old daughter eats the whole thing by herself.  Fresh tuna is cubed and mixed with cherry tomatoes and avocado.  I mix soy sauce and wasabi in the dipping dish and pour slowly on top.  If you try to pour soy sauce over it, it will drench the fish and it is just salty.  Enjoy them with Taro and Rencon(Lotus) Chips.  Taro is the ones with spots.  Rencon(Lotus) has holes.
