Uchi////We frequently hit up the happy hour from 5 - 7 p.m. where we are able to order more items and get the best variety Uchi has to offer. After around ~10 visits our top picks would definitely be the Machi Cure, Ham & Eggs, Brussels Sprouts, and Walu Walu. However, you really can't go wrong with any dish as we have loved every single one.
