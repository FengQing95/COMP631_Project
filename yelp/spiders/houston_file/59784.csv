Baby Barnaby's////This is a very colorful restaurant...if you get my drift! I have ventured to this restaurant with both my father and boyfriend and have liked my food both times. The last time I went here my bf ordered the protein burrito and the waiter said, "good choice, but it's a mouthful!" [wink wink]. Very flamboyant fellow who made my morning a little more merry :) Also, OJ is fantastic and there are good vegetarian options.
