Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In terms of preference some of my favorite dishes are as follows: French toast (obsessed), Benny Goodman (yum), Drunkn Monkey French Toast, and the Egg White Frittata. There are tons and tons of options so there should always be a solid choice for everyone. All the locations have a cute vibe to them so its a good date spot, Sunday brunch, fam time, really whatever you want. I've not had their morning cocktails but from people around I have heard positive reviews. You should definitely try things besides the basic mimosas or bloody marys.
