Uchi////On the topic of COVID, I was particularly impressed with how Uchi has been able to adapt to a socially-distanced, safe dining experience without it feeling sterile or uncomfortable. The front desk did an incredible job of communicating with us in advance of our reservation to explain the protocol for arrival. There are undoubtedly less tables in the dining room than there were pre-COVID, but it doesn't feel empty or odd inside. It's a warm, intimate dining experience without the anxiety of dining too close to strangers.
