Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered a beer and an order of the pig candy, which was delicious! I don't think I saw it on the menu, but I know they'd had it before (and truth be told, it was the reason I returned) so I asked if they still had it - and they thankfully did. If you're looking for some deliciously sticky sweet pork belly, this is the dish you want. It comes with kimchi, but is delicious all on its own. Definitely recommend!
