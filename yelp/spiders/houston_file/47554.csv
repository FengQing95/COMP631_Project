Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I decided to be somewhat healthy, and order a veggie eggs benedict dish. Instead of an English muffin, the base was a roasted red pepper/cauliflower cake with sauteed kale and a poached egg with hollandaise. It also came with a hash brown cake. Sounded like a great choice!
