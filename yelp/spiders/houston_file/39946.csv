Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was hesitant about the donut burger. But the waiter described it as a mixture of sweet and heavy savory. Imagine like a premium mcgriddle situation if you will. Soo good if you're into that thing. I am. So what started as a maybe ended up being a great choice. A little heavy (beware its 2 hamburger patties) so I was unable to finish but I also was busy chowing down on those delicious fries. Get the fries. Worth the carbs
