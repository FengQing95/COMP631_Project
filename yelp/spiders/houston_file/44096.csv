Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I first came for Sunday brunch and it was packed with a line out of the door. I hear there is often a line so strap on your patience as it does move along and worth the wait. Seating is also difficult during peak dining hours. The place is small and quite cramped. If weather permits, I suggest the patio area.  Our food order made up for it though.  We had the French toast, vegetarian quiche and side sausage gravy with biscuits. Everything was tasty and top notch!  The vanilla latte was perfect, well-balanced and not overly sweet.
