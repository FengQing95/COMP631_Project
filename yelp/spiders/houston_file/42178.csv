Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The line moved very quickly and the food was served in the same manner.  We ordered quite a few things from the menu (which changes often).  My favorite was the Boudin Benedict!  I've had some legitimate Boudin from Louisiana and have to say Common Bond did some great work with their Boudin.  My only wish is that they would use a poached egg rather than a fried egg because I really love the texture and flavor of the runny yolk you get with a poached egg.
