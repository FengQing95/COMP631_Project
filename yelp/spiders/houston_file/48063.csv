Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The only downsides are the parking and the long wait times, especially on the weekends. Be willing to park on the neighborhood streets and walk a bit. (But watch out for the signs! Tow trucks are merciless in Montrose.) Also, don't try to go to Snooze if you are in a rush. Unless you catch a rare slow moment in the middle of a weekday, you will have a wait. It's not uncommon to wait 45 - 60 minutes around brunchtime on the weekends.
