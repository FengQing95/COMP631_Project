Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This was also another Houston breakfast spot that I had heard a lot of about prior to moving here. The atmosphere is very welcoming and full of energy. Long lines, but that is to be expected. The menu had decent choices, and I really liked their pancake options. Overall, I had a good experience and the server I had was also great.
