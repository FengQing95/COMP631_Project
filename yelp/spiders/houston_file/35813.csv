Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was good but it didn't blow my mind.  Went for Houston Restaurant Week - and the portions were pretty decent compared to the other restaurants I've been too. Terry was the best waiter.   Made us laugh and was super sweet.  They forgot one of the dishes we ordered, but it was okay since all of the other food was way too much for us.  It worked out perfectly.  The desserts were pretty rich.  We ordered the peach cobbler (delicious!) and the red velvet churros (definitely not disappointed).  Jose was awesome, too!  The ambiance was nice.  They had a live dj tonight.  The music was good but a bit loud to have a conversation.  Also I thought the restroom attendant was a bit OTT.  Like, I felt bad I didn't tip him, but I don't carry cash on me.  Cute date night place and perfect for the bourbon drinker in your life.  Would go back and asking for Terry when I do!
