JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love noodles. And I love Jinya's Cha Cha Cha Garlic Ramen. The broth is thick, creamy, and flavorful. The thick noodles are dense and chewy. The pork in the ramen is a mix mix of fatty and lean, be prepared. I really shouldn't have written this review not in the restaurant because it's making me hungry.
