Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I thought this place would actually be good but I was very disappointed when we walked in the hostess asked rudely May I help you as if we were out of dress code or something she then proceeded to speak under her breath about where we were sitting so we started walking towards a table before she interrupts finally saying the table isn't ready. Next the employees all stared at us while we waited around for ten minutes to be servers water WATER is just a normal thing to assume someone wants water and to be seated I actually felt disrespected. Then the waitress comes looking all depressed and apologizes, but the worst part is that it wasn't sincere. But when we decide to take our business elsewhere we were finally greeted like normal human beings. Not coming back here
