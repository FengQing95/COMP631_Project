Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my friend had the grilled cheese. You'd think it would be a basic grilled cheese on some sort of good bread because it is a bakery after all, but no, this grilled cheese was amazing. How do I know? She let me try it. I don't know what kind of bread it was made with but goodness, it was tasty. Fluffy, done to perfection, with melting oozing cheese that melted in my mouth, yum!
