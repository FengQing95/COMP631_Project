JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here for dinner and the place was packed. We sat at the bar for a couple of bottles of sake. About 45 mins later we got our table and were seated at their large center table. Keep in mind this table is not good for conversation. You can only hear and talk to the two people next to you and thats it. The service was great and pretty much typical so no complaints there.
