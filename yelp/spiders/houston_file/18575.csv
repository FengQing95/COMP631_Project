Uchi////***Changed my rating from 4 star to 5 star.. I've been back here multiple times since this visit and it never fails..after every visit I leave extremely satisfied! I usually get anything they recommend, most items on the happy hour menu and the Hot Rock Wagyu Beef, and Hamachi Nabe- kinda like a fried rice dish.. but really good! I like all of the desserts too! The fried milk and lemon is my two faves! One of my fave places to eat for any celebration or if I leave work early enough to catch hh.
