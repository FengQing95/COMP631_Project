Uchi////They use a different kind of salt in it which made me appreciate it more because right when you eat it, it melts in your mouth automatically. We had hamachi for a start, small but flavorful! spiny tuna, and pitch fork. Who would have thought beef in your sushi would taste so good? As a person who personally dislike beef or any kind of red meat, this one is a yum!
