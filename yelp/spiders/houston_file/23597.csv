Uchi////First, we took advantage of the complimentary valet and were warned that it might be quite a wait (~1.5 hours!) since the restaurant was super busy and it was a Friday night. We weren't in a rush so we decided to stick with it and walked over to the restaurant. I was slightly confused as to where the entrance was, but I think I'm just a dummy since my wife found it immediately :) When we walked inside, the hostess told us that it would probably be more like ~45 minutes (hurray!) and led us out to a patio waiting area where we could order drinks and some munchies to keep us occupied. We were just getting settled and debating drink choices when someone came and told us that a couple of spots had opened up, so we were only outside for about ~10-15 minutes! The restaurant contains private tables (where your party will be sitting by themselves) as well as communal tables (where your party will share a larger table with strangers), and I think the main reason why our wait was shorter was that we were OK sitting at a communal table.
