Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had a donut burger which was so fun! All my friends wanted to take pictures because it looked so cute! The cheese on the two burgers was delicious. We also had tater tots as appetizers and they were perfectly crispy! I had a bloody mary and it was good. Wasn't very strong. It came with an olive, celery, pork belly and a bread and butter pickle in it which I wasn't particularly a fan of. My friend had the mimosa which was mostly orange juice.
