The Pit Room////This place is southern hospitality at its finest. It's not just the food that makes a place phenomenal it's the customer service. The Pit Room really impressed me. I travel quite a bit, but this was my first time in Houston and I really wanted some Texas BBQ I could only get in Houston. Â We narrowed our search down to three places and this place was highly recommended on Yelp it wasn't the closest, however it was worth the drive.
