JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really don't understand the hype around this place. I live super close by, and every weekend night there is a line out the door for these over priced noodles. Â I gave this place multiple shots, but every time the ramen was just ok and the broth is very fatty. I've also ordered dumplings that were fine at best. It's super loud, and super dark also, which detracts from the experience in my opinion. There are plenty of better ramen places in the area that are also cheaper.
