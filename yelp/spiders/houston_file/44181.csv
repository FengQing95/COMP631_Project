Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not saying I want kale for breakfast with a side plate of adderall, but I am saying that the healthiest option on the menu should not be an adorable jar the size of my gullet with sweetened yogurt and granola and berries. There is, unhappily, something called TOO much of a good thing. Also, I was underwhelmed by the macaroons. Probably because I'm used to Ladur√©e, but I didn't think the two I had came anywhere close.
