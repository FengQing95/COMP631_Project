Baby Barnaby's////I like eggs as much as the next person, but I wouldn't pay for food I feel like I can make just as well, which isn't saying much b/c I am a kitchen newb. The huevos rancheros consisted of two eggs cooked however you want, some runny black beans, and potato squares. I did not enjoy the sauce that came with it either. Tasted way too bland.
