The Pit Room////As for the sides, the mac and cheese was a bit standard.. Which was a bit disappointing to me. I guess because this place is talked up about so much I was looking for something more in the mac and cheese. Something just.. more than just basic mac and cheese. It was also the same way for the beans as well. I was looking for something more since the hype is so real, but was kind of left behind the band wagon. Honestly, I think my favorite side dish was the potato salad. Which it might be just the fact that I was missing mayo, but it had a good crunch and the overall flavor was pretty on point and outside of your basic potato salad.
