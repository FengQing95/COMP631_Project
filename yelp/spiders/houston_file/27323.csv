The Pit Room////Secondly the brisket he gave me was a terrible slice. It had some of the burnt end which is fine but also included the heaviest, fattest part of the brisket which included nothing but fat and gristle. I felt like the dude gave me the "unwanted" parts for some reason, what cause I'm a short Asian guy with glasses I definitely know nothing about central Texas BBQ huh, maybe I need to wear jeans and a red hat (maga?) to get the "good cuts"
