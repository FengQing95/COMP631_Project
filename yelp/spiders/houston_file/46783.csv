Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food was awesome!! Servers were great :) There was a line when we got there, so we chose to sit outside on a hot summer morning, but the umbrellas provided adequate shade. The servers were VERY attentive even though we were seated outside. Their local coffee was strong but not bitter, which is exactly what I was looking for.
