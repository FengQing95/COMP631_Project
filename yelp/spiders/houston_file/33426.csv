Local Foods////This review is related to one experience. I (usually) have no issue and the food is great (4+ stars, easy. Having said that, they need to have a conversation with one of their folks taking orders. I shouldn't spend what feels like an eternity waiting for you to finish telling an aggie joke followed by talking about your favorite wine down to the flavor profile to folks who already have newly poured glasses of wine and have paid. Just because the manager felt the need to open up the other register because a line has clearly formed does not give you carte blanche to ramp up the chit chat.
