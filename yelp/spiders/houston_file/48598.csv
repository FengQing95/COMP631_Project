Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The rich, buttery, and uniquely flavored pancakes are a must-have! If you prefer a savory brunch, you can choose from a plethora of creamy, rich, and flavorful options including many varieties of eggs Benedict, sandwiches, and scrambles! There are endless vegetarian and gluten free options upon request. The service is awesome and the staff is very accommodating.
