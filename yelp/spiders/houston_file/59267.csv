Baby Barnaby's////I really, really like this place! I went here on a Wednesday so it wasn't very busy.  It was a little after 11 and since they were only serving breakfast inside that's were most of their customers were sitting, but even so there was no wait to be seated.  I had a coffee, light and sweet, and it was just right not too strong, not too weak.  I also had a glass of their fresh orange juice and I loved it, no sugar added! it was like eating an orange!
