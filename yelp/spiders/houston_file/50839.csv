Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have to say, I wasn't sure what all the hype was about this place. I've been here a few times now and the food here is great and def worth the wait (whatever wait time they tell you it's actually a lot less) which roughly is 45-1hr during peak time. The best time to go if you want to avoid a long wait is to go around 130ish.
