Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It is not my first time at snooze but I decided to get something different this time. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was average, I wouldn't honestly order it again because it was a bit bland. But the OMG French toast is out of this world. They are so tasty and amazing. I would just go back for the them. The service was really good and everyone was really nice.
