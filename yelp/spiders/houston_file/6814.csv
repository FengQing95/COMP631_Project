JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Walking in, JInya loooks super cool and the interior was very modern yet traditional at the same time. plenty of room to move around while still accommodating a good amount of people. Waitress Â was almost a little too friendly but was attentive all the same. the prices are quite ridiculous however....$10+ for a bowl of ramen that doesn't even include corn or bamboo shoots or egg? Man....if i ordered everything that i'm used to being in my bowl my ramen would be at least $15, which really just doesn't make sense. Takoyaki balls were yummy and big though, and presented nicely.
