Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Folks, really?? "We can't cut your croissant in half, the bakers will bite our heads off." "The Bialy is already cut in half, no we can't cut it again...the bakers won't let us touch knives." "We stopped breakfast at 10:30, lunch doesn't start until 11 - yes, we know it's 10:34"
