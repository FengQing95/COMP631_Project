Baby Barnaby's////This is the original Barnaby's Cafe, which is also why it is the smallest. Wait times here get hectic for brunch-- whether it is for indoor or outdoor seating. Even with the large fans, they do not stand a chance against the Houston heat. My favorites are the Migas and the Huevos Rancheros. Their OJ is freshly squeezed and comes in a small glass.
