JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Vegetarian review: JINYA is an experience, not just a meal. I've been here several times with my school friends and have enjoyed the ramen and the environment each time. For vegetarians, there are not too many options (so visiting more than once or twice a year might get boring) and the meal can become pricy rather quickly.
