Uchi////Upon entrance, I was greeted with a hello and a "Chive On" because I was wearing a Chive Bill Murray shirt.  Anyways, we ordered the Omakase.  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  I was taken away by the flavor and texture between the rice and fish.  Even the Pork Belly with Pickled Watermelon Radish was unbelievable.
