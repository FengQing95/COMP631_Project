Kata Robata////The food is the reason I'll be heading back and soon! The crunch eel roll, veggie tempura, crispy calamari, Japanese dumplings, takoyaki, and soft shell crab are just a few of the reasons that you'll find me a regular at Kata Robata.  The crunch eel roll had the perfect amount of sweet eel sauce over a crunch middle. The dumplings were pan fried and delicious! The calamari was in a light tempura batter and came with two different types of dipping sauce. The yakitori was perfectly grilled and basted with a sweet teriyaki sauce. The soft shell crab was very good, even if it was a little overly fried.  My husband really enjoyed his veggie tempura, even though we still wonder what some of the vegetables were. The unagi was wonderful and warm with the tasty eel sauce on top. The Ginger lamb was a stand out. The takoyaki (octopus balls) were just ok; I might be especially critical as I recently had them in Hawaii and they were fabulous there. Overall our food was very good and no one disliked anything. All of the dishes are on the smaller side so you can get quite a few and share them.  It's a great marketing and business plan by Kata Robata, because we ended up with a bill of over $50 a person in the end.
