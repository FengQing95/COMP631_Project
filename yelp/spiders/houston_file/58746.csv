Baby Barnaby's////A couple notes: weekday breakfasts early in the AM (between 8 and 9) are not busy... no wait. However, weekends are crazy. So FYI, the Barnaby's Caf√© on W Gray serves a very similar (maybe exactly the same, I'm not too sure) breakfast with usually no wait on the weekends. Good alternative not even 5 minutes away with the same great breakfast.
