Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I alway enjoy coming here. The ambiance is nice and the staff is friendly. The food however is so-so...the entrees are not worth it in my opinion to eat. I do however enjoy the bread. Soft and fluffy croissants , desiccant cakes. It is a bit pricy for the quality but they do have the quantity.
