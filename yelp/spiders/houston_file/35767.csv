Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was average with some really tasty bites. We got the hush puppies and cornbread for appetizers and hey we're both extremely bland. The server (Kerry) and chef were great people and did whatever they could to accommodate us. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary with a 2 year old in tow so we needed a place that could accommodate his picky eating habits. They made him a small hamburger patty that he gobble up and then made a 2nd one at a very reasonable price. He loved it and has never eaten that much! I had the pulled pork which had some really flavorful bites with the pinions being exceptionally tasty. But there were more than a few bland bites. My hubby had the chicken and thought it was good. The dirty rice was flavorful and spicy! We ordered the Bosscat fries and they were AHH-MAZING. Hands down the best part of our meal. The drink were great as well.
