Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went here yesterday around 10am with a friend. There was no parking in their lot, but we were both able to find parking on the street next to the restaurant. There was a 15-30 minute wait for a table even at 10am on a Thursday. The service was good, but pretty slow at times. I ordered the Flight with a side of hash browns and my friend got the Chilaquiles Benedict. We both enjoyed our food. I had the pineapple upside down, sweet potato, and cinnamon roll pancakes. The first was my favorite of the three, and the hash browns were great.
