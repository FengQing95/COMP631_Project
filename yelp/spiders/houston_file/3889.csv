JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi J P - Thanks for the 5-star review! The analogy we like to use is this: If instant coffee is like the Top Ramen you ate in college, then JINYA Ramen is like a cup of hot Starbucks. Definitely more expensive than Top Ramen, but you can taste where the money goes! Thank you again for the kind words, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
