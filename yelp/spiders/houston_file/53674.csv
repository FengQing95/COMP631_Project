Kata Robata////So far I like their kata ramen is one of my favorites since my wife and I cannot find a good noodle house here in Houston. Their chef specials tend to be sound especially when they have chutoro and other rarer Japanese fish that some restaurants don't serve. Even their ginger tastes fresher and isn't that weird pinkish color that you usually find.
