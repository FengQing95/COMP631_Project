JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Actually, the reviews, commercial video by the owner & photos of the menu items were all so impressive, it was enough to get me in there on a Saturday evening.   I will return when the place isn't soooooooooooooo crowded ... I was tucked in between a couple on their first date and a single guy with a large appetite (his plates were in my space, but I'm nice & he was clearly hungry) - all at the bar top in front of the entrance.  I enjoyed my meal, but hustled out quickly since it appeared the big groups coming in were mostly there to mingle with each other and have cocktails while waiting for a table.  This place is definitely a hit for groups of friends... The service was seriously top notch even though they were super busy - I was very impressed with their speed and teamwork to get all the customers taken care of quickly.
