Kata Robata////On May 4, 2017, I arrived about 9:15 pm, after a long day visiting a patient convalescing over at the medical center.  The small parking lot was full and I literally got the last spot.  I was seated immediately. I said I would start with the ceviche and then I'd like the hamachi kama. I also wanted to try the hokkaido scallop sushi special.  The ceviche came out after 15 minutes, and 2 minutes later, after a photo and 1 mouthful, there was the hamachi kama (both served by different not-my-waitress). I said I wasn't ready for it, and that person fetched my waitress.  Her response was that the kitchen wasn't busy so it came out quickly.  I hate not being given time to eat the appetizer as much as I hate getting it after the entree. (Yes, I know the Asian culture just serves it as it's ready, but they are here in the US, and label it as an appetizer, so CONFORM already.  Rant over.)  On another day I might've sent it back, but on this day, I was exhausted and hungry, so I ate the hot food first.  If you like your yellowtail collar crispy, burnt, and tasting like charcoal, then this is the place for you; I do not, but after I removed all the burnt bits, the remainder was ok.  Certainly not even in the top 50 hamachi kama I've had. (I like it, so I order it a lot; it is a dish upon which I base my opinion of a restaurant.)  The ceviche was also not good.  While the fish was fresh, it just tasted like plain fish - no acidity or tanginess, unless each morsel was dipped in the juice - suggesting it really had not "cooked" in the juice. By the time I got to them, the taro chips were limp, not crispy (which is why they should serve the appetizer first).  Some 25 minutes after the other food, someone (also not-my-waitress) delivered the scallop sushi, which turned out to be not special at all.  And then it took 20 minutes to get the bill.
