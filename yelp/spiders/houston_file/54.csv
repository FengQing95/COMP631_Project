Local Foods////This is a very casual relaxed place. Except during weekday lunch time.  But what place isn't crazy during those hours?   The egg salad sandwich is one of the best ever. The sides range from potato chips to pastas.  Wasn't really a fan of most of their sides but to each his own.  The chips though are tasty.  There's some lime and orange drink made in house that is very good.  Bonus they sell those pretzel buns so you won't be craving them later.
