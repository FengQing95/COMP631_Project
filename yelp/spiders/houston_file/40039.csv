Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for Houston Restaurant Weeks.  We did not have reservations and were told at the hostess stand it would be an hour wait.  We put our name down and went to the bar to grab a drink and in the time it took for us to decide on a drink and whether or not to stay, a table opened up!  Our waiter was friendly and informed as we had questions about the gluten free options.   The best part of the meal was the short rib flatbread to start - it was loaded with short rib.  Everything else was just a miss for us, especially the GF pasta with crab - very dry and very little crab for the price.
