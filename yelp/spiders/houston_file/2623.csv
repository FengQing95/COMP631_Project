JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They do serve other foods such tempura, rice bowls, and takoyaki (nice!) but in the end it's all about their ramen. The interior is also nice and modern but rather small as it's ideal for groups of 2-4 people. Service has been either a hit-or-miss as servers can be inattentive or forgetful but they are generally polite each time I've visited. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to people who are looking for good, tasty ramen or looking for new place to try out.
