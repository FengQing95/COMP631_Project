Local Foods////This is by far my favorite restaurant in Houston! The egg salad sandwich on pretzel bun is to die for. Handmade chips are almost as good as the hand squeezed juices! Great seating with a very open set up encouraging patrons to sit at the same large tables. Fun and bright vibe, simply THE BEST
