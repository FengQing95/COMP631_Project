Local Foods////Finally getting around to reviewing--- I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time, so my friend took me here after I got back to Houston after a long trip away. I shouldn't be surprised that because it's in the Village that parking was awful. It is right next to Benjy's and the parking lot is fairly small, so that was probably the worst part.
