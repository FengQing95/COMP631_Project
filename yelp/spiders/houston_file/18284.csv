Uchi////This place was awesome.  The food was so creative and delicious.  The steamed mussels on "compressed honeydew" with basil and a cacophony of other things really stands out in my mind.  I didn't think I would like it but it was probably my favorite thing.  We also had a dish that included raw fish (maybe tuna I don't remember), sliced apple, goat cheese, and some other things.  That was pretty spectacular too.
