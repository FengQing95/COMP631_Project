JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant is located within a building block that included some other food shops and a parking garage. Unfortunately we went on one of the days that Houston flash flooded and we had to walk quite a distance from our car on the roof of the garage to the restaurant. Seeing us drenched, the hostesses offered a container to store our umbrella. We were seated and served by a really nice lady who helped us with the menu, suggesting which noodle bowls were the most popular. She checked up on us often to make sure we were enjoying our food. The soup was delicious and the noodles were thin and the right amount of texture. Each ramen soup had very diverse combinations of veggies, meats, herbs and other condiments that truly enhanced the flavors.
