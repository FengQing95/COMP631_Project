JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////i love exploring and trying new ramen bars around Houston. the overall experience i had at jinya was great but a few things were lacking though the soup was good i wasn't satisfied with the flavor i had the tonkotsu black ramen but my girlfriend had the spicy creamy vegan ramen and she said that was amazing! we also shared a pork bun and the flavor was great. also the service was a little slow as in the wait time for our food the severs were very nice and polite. I don't know if i would go back for more but for a first time ramen experience that's a good place to start but definitely explore!
