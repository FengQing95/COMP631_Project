Uchi////Naturally when at a sushi place, or any place really, comparisons are made with what you've had before. So I think about Sugarfish and Nobu in the Los Angeles area, the only two places that could be comparable to Uchi... and let me tell you -- Uchi wins. In overall creativity of dishes, services, and taste, there is no comparison. (But I will admit that the sashimi wasn't up to par as other places in California but every other piece of sushi blew it out of the water... haha.. water, get it?)
