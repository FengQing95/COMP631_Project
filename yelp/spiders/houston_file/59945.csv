Baby Barnaby's////As for the one negative aspect of this restaurant, it is the wait... oh damn, the wait.  Time it right or the wait will be unbearable.  It is a small establishment, and the crowd is horrendous on the weekends.  They place a clipboard up that you write your name on when it is busy, which is good because you can figure out how many people are ahead of you.  This place also is not suitable for large parties.  Please open another location, Baby!!!  I'm sure your fans would love it!
