JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A pretty well known chain ramen bar, Jinya lives up to expectation, but doesn't surpass. I may not be a ramen expert, but I don't know if JINYA was all that unique to my taste buds as I would've thought. But, that being said, if you're looking for high quality ramen, this is a good spot. The atmosphere is very cool too, but not too great for socializing. You'll basically only be chatting up the person to your left or right and it's not the best for parties or get togethers. Also it can get quite loud during busy hours. I did enjoy my food and was served quickly despite the crowd, so here goes my 4. I just wish seating was a bit better for large groups and that it could be more unique. But being a chain, these are expected costs. Anyways, would recommend if it's your first or second time having good ramen!
