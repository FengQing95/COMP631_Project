Kata Robata////I've only ever been for dinner and we usually make a reservation because it does get busy. The times we didn't have a reservation we waited about 30 minutes for a table. The entrance for waiting is very uncomfortably small and the bar area gets equally as uncomfortably tight during the weekend dinner rush. I couldn't imagine waiting in that small of an area with a group so I'd recommend making a reservation.
