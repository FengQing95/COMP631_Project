JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My only complaint is about the egg.  For this particular ramen it cost extra and was delivered on the side.  It was delivered whole, which made it awkward to handle and eat.  It was cooked well with a nice soft center, however the interior was cold, like it had just come out of the refrigerator.
