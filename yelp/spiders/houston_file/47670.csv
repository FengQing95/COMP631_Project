Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place!! Not only is the food always amazing, but so is the staff. Snooze as a company also does great work for their communities which is not something you see every day. My only complaint is that I wish everyone else didn't love Snooze so much, so there wouldn't be such a long wait standing between me and my OMG french toast!
