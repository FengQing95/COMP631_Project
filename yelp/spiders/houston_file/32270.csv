Local Foods////Fresh sandwiches, local wine selections, pleasant casual ambience with excellent indie music playing in the back ground. Â Concrete floors, brick walls, and cute hipster furniture. I'd recommend for a casual lunch date with friends or even alone! I tried their crunchy chicken sandwich which was packed with chicken and unique dressings, sides if quinoa which was fantastic.
