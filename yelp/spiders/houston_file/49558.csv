Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If I were rating Snooze on food alone, it would easily get 5 stars. I ordered the Snooze Spuds Deluxe and for as simple as it seemed on the menu, it was very tasty. The portion looked small at first, but I ended up having a hard time finishing it. Everyone else in my party greatly enjoyed the food also - truly no complaints there.
