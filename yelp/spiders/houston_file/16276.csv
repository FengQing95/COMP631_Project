JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You walk in and you are facing this small wooden bar with the hostess booth to the left.  After talking to the hostess, they brought us into the dimly lit dining area and we were met with the greeting they were doing for all the new guests.  We would hear it over and over again but it was novel and added to the experience.
