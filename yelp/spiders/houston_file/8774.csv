JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////One of my favorite Ramen places in the Houston area. The ingredients always taste so fresh and the orders are made quickly. I normally get my food to go and the process is painless. My only issue happened the one time I dined in. I was alone and was seated at the back counter, right in front of where they are prepare the food. I was placed right next to where they pick up drinks even though there was more space at the counter. The service and the food make up for the one little issue. Next time I will try to go with a group!
