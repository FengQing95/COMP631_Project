JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Moreover, every JINYA franchise owner is required to spend no fewer than 30 full days of training with JINYA's chefs and management in Los Angeles. Our core staff in Houston learned the very specific recipes and cooking techniques from Tomo's staff, and we have trained our staff here in Houston in the same way. Every single person in our restaurant works hard to provide a premium product, and after nearly 18 months of working at this 7 days a week, I believe our collective abilities to provide authentic Japanese-style Tonkotosu ramen has very little to do with our nationalities. We are proud of our work, and are equally grateful that folks like yourself have enjoyed our fare. We thank you very much for your patronage, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
