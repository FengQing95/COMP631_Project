JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Lastly, I must take umbrage with your comment that we are catering to "clueless 20-year-olds." JINYA-Midtown has been open for approximately 15 months, and in that time we have seen a vast array of customers walk through our door, from all walks of life, representing nearly every ethnicity and age demographic. Furthermore, I have personally discussed ramen with many of these so-called "clueless 20-year-olds" who have traveled around Asia, have spent years teaching English in Japan, and their opinion of our ramen is diametrically opposed to yours. However, I suppose the one of point of agreement here is that they believe the ramen scene in Houston is still young, still growing, and will continue to grow with the proper support from the public and the ability to meet that demand.
