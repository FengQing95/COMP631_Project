Kata Robata////Third, a sashimi dish (multiple sashimi). This included flounder two ways (with some powder and other with caviar), blood clam and giant clam, otoro (of course), and this other white buttery fish that was delicious. I must say, I'm not a big fan of clam... just because of the chewiness? But it was great to open up my palette to try it!
