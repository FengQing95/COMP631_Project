Uchi////We ordered more food but I'm too lazy to list them out. We also got two other complementary desserts, I guess one each for my birthday and our anniversary. All in all, I was very satisfied with the food as well as the friendly service. I was especially surprised and pleased with all the complementary food we received. I will definitely come back here another time.
