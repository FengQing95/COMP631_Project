Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sunday Brunch wait was 1 hour and 1/2, which I completely expected and was happy for me and my lovely +1 to wait for. We very much appreciated the attempt at a parking lot, complimentary coffee, text message alert when our table was ready, and random board games to make our wait very accommodating.
