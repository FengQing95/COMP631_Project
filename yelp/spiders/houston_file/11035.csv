JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered their spicy chicken ramen and added mushrooms because I love them in my soup. The server was horrible and MIA throughout our meal. Our drinks sat empty throughout our experience. She forgot to add mushrooms to my ramen. As a way to "fix" the problem she said they were coming on the side. She ended up bringing them to me about 5 minutes AFTER I finished my ramen. So that was pointless AF. She seemed to be either overwhelmed by work or just completely underwhelmed by life in general.
