JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Charles - Thank you very much for your review. It's a time-tested truth in the restaurant business that word-of-mouth advertising is the best advertising there is. And to that end, I am grateful you took your friend's recommendation and even more grateful that you enjoyed your dining experience with us. As an authentic ramen house, JINYA aims to introduce aspects of Japanese dining and business culture that aren't yet familiar in the states, namely our "Irrashai" greeting and the communal-dining tables. Understandably, we're never going to be all things to all people, but we will always work hard to provide the best Japanese ramen Houston has to offer.
