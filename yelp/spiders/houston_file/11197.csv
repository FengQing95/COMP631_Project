JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chris - Thank you for your review. We appreciate the constructive feedback. I understand fully your concern with our Crispy Chicken Wings. As a franchise concept, we are required to carry certain menu items that are created by our corporate headquarters, which is based in Los Angeles. And in the case of the wings, we are required to serve these organic chicken wings from Jidori Chickens that are raised and shipped from California.
