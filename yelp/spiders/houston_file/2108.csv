JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as the food is concerned, JINYA was founded by our CEO Tomonori Takahashi, who owned several restaurants in Ebisu, Japan, before bringing his Japanese ramen concept to the U.S. several years ago. His goal was to make the taste of JINYA ramen as authentically Japanese as possible. Again, JINYA will never be all things to all people, but we work very hard and give our best effort.
