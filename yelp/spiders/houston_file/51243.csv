Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was okay. I ordered a pancake sampler. My issue with the food is that any of their sweeter breakfast items (pancakes, waffles, etc) are just way too sweet. It feels like everything is just drowned in sugar. Also, I ordered a cortado, and just wasn't good, though it is a bit hard to compete with all the specialty coffee shops in that area. The savory food items were decent, and the prices were as well. The staff was nice too.
