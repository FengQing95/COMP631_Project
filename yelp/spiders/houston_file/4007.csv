JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Francisco - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your meal. May I ask which ramen you ordered, and what you specifically mean by "the broth tasted weird"? We don't often hear this about our ramen, so it behooves us to find out what was lacking about your meal.
