Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As mentioned, the chocolate croissant was very good. The "Buffalo" Turkey sandwich was supposed to have blue cheese dressing but if it did, then it was very light. The "buffalo" spice, if any, was very mild to nonexistent. If you like your bacon fatty and gristley, then you might like this entree. I didn't. As for the latte...I'm heading back to Starbucks.
