Local Foods////5/5- The Crunchy Chicken sandwich: The First sandwich I tried from here and damn is it hard to order anything else when I know how delicious this item is.  Shredded chicken, pickles, provolone, buttermilk ranch, with a crunch that comes from a nut crumble- sounds amazing right?  The bun is where they take it next level because all this is placed between a pretzel roll.
