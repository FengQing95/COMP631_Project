Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was really disappointed in this dish. I'm such a huge fan of any kind of egg benedict that this was just downright disrespectful. First of all, the hash brown was so dry and some parts were even burnt. The eggs were poached nicely and runny and I liked the fresh salmon. That was all I liked about this dish. The hollandaise sauce didn't mix well with the salmon and made it taste almost sour. It was just a dry dish overall. No thanks~
