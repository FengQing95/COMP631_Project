The Pit Room////I love this place with enough nice wooden table and seats. Waiters are so friendly. Definitely the food is amazing! I tried two meat dinner with pork ribs and brisket. It is a pity that all their sausages were sold out when we arrived there. This is the start of my love for Texas barbecue LOL!
