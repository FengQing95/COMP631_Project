JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So good and perfect for this cool weather!   Had the spicy chicken ramen and tempura brussel sprouts.   The food is always on point, can't think of a bad experience here at all.   The atmosphere is great, great city dining experience.  Usually always busy and full restaurant.   The service is always super friendly too, definitely recommend!
