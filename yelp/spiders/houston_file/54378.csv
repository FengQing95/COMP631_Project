Kata Robata////The bone marrow is definitely an appetizer. It came with some toasted bread, as well as some pickled onions, mustard seeds, and salt and lime to accentuate it, each has a different flavor profile and brings out different flavors in the bone marrow. I'd never had bone marrow before, and the best way to describe it is buttery, animal goodness. If you're feeling adventurous, this is definitely something fun!
