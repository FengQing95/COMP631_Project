Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service: very friendly waiters and hostess, always dancing or have a smile on their face.. Makes you want to dance and smile along with them! We made reservation for this soft opening for 11am, and got seating by 11:25am. The place was packed and they haven't even officially open yet!
