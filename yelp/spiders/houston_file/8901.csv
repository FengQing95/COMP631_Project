JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thanks your review and visit to Jinya Ramen Bar.  I appreciate the fact that you are "foodie" and for letting me know of your experience.  Clumped noodles is a no no.  I have just sent a mass text to each and every single ramen chef that there will be serious issues if I find anyone not stirring the the noodles and serving them clumped.  Secondly, tonight both my wife and I were inside the restaurant and customers came in "waves" and in big parties.  So, instead of the regular massive wait of people in the front, we would pack the restaurant, people would get up near the same time and there will be empty seats again.  However, we were forced to save many of the seats because there were always parties of 8 and 10 waiting for those seat even though they were incomplete.  I've been in the restaurant business for 25 years and til this day, there isn't a perfect way to seat customers.  Also, this week was the first week of classes so naturally it was a slower week overall.  I own several other restaurants and opening week for school always result in a 15% drop in sales.
