JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very spacious in comparison to ramen joints in California. Nice lighting. 100% of the patrons I saw last night (after 10pm) were teens-30s. Servers were very accommodating. You can watch your food being made if you want to (open kitchen). We ordered squid balls, cold ramen and #1 on the menu. All were delicious.
