Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very cute European style cafe. I went in on a Saturday 20 minutes before closing and the place was packed! No line, parking wasn't too full. I actually managed to park right in front of the door. I was hoping to see the korean beef on the menu, but it was unavailable that day. I have never seen croissants anywhere in Houston that look as authentic as theirs! I was super excited to try one so I went with a fruit croissant and an olive and walnut bread to go. The fruit croissant smelled buttery and looked gorgeous and flaky, and it tasted buttery and sweet. I'm not really a dessert fan, but it was good. The bread...oh man it was soooo good. I'm a sucker for artisan bread and that olive loaf was amazing. It had rosemary which played really nicely with the brininess of the olives and the walnuts added a nice bite. The crust was PERFECT. Crisp on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside with large air pockets which I love. Would definitely come back to get more of that bread, or maybe even try another bread. The other pastries they had also looked fabulous. This place is definitely a pastry lovers' dream. Will be back.
