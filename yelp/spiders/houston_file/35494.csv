Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback from your experience. I'm pleased you enjoyed your time with us starting from the moment you sat and until the valet promptly returned your car. As you mentioned, we are equal parts bar and restaurant and when dinner is over, people such as your self enjoy being able to hang out at the bar without needing to go somewhere else. And despite our extensive whiskey selection, we have cocktails with a wide variety of spirits for every palate. If you loved the Bosscat Burger, please come back and give our 12 Hour Braised Short Rib a try! We'll see you next time Patricia!
