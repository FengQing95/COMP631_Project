JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great Ramen! First timer but it was very delicious. We ordered the 5 piece chicken as an appetizer, but it wasnt anything special. Just fried chicken. We then ordered the Spicy (mild) Chicken Ramen. Its not spicy at all! We ended up adding hot sauce to it :)) Great place, great experience. The only downside is the wait time, it was about 35 minutes at 7pm.
