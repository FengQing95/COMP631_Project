Kata Robata////Apparently they make this with cheese from dairy maids - a local cheese shop. Personally I felt like the crust of cheese on top was too much. It was too salty and just too much. I felt sick after having eaten less than half the dish - I suppose there can be too much of a good thing. There was a lot of lobster in it though and it tasted very fresh.
