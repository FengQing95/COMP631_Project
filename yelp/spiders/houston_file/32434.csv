Local Foods////ATMOSPHERE: I enjoy the nice open concept with lots of natural sunlight. Because of the amount of business they do during lunch it does get quite crowded. You may find yourself sharing a big table or being awfully closer to other patrons at one of the small tables against the wall. That can be a little awkward if you'd rather not hear other conversations and/or have people hear yours.
