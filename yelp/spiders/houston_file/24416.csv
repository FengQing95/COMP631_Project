Uchi////This was our first dining out experience after COVID started. Sat at the outdoor patio which was very cute (could hear some traffic noises but nothing overwhelming). We went with the omakase and everything was amazing. We recently moved from NYC to Houston and was resigned to not having great sushi here, but Uchi completely changed our minds. We ordered extra sushi on top of the omakase, and everything we tried was on point. Will definitely be back.
