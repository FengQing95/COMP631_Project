Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food- presentation is amazing, you salivate just walking in the door! The Benny duo is unmatched, even the side of hashbrowns was too good. The pancake flight was equally amazing, and they were so willing to accommodate my customizations and substitutions. You enjoy every bite at Snooze.
