JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Slowly but surely, it's happening.  We're starting to see more  Ramen restaurants popping up around town  I had heard that JINYA was really good from a couple of friends and read some really positive reviews, so I had to go see for myself.  The Verdict? We have a new leader for Best Ramen in the city! I had the Tonkotsu Black and requested for it spicy.  The broth was perfect with awesome flavor and the spice level provided just enough heat without overpowering.  Loved the flavor the garlic oil in it.  The pork was also cooked perfectly, full of flavor and moist.  The noodles were good but could be better.
