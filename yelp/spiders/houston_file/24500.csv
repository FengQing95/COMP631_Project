Uchi////Having recently returned from living in Osaka Japan, I had to give in to the hype and try Uchi. Every dish was world class and the sushi was on par with what i've had in Japan. Bit pricey, but that's what you get if you want authentic japanese sushi. This place is not your average sushi restaurant. Having worked in the service industry myself I got to say they run a tight ship, all the servers were well informed and very knowledgable about their menu.
