Uchi////- LAST but not LEAST...the worst thing EVER! They would not allow us to separate our check. We needed to split a $499 check between 3 couples & looking through 20+ line items of foreign food names to figure out who ate what & then calculate it, was impossible. It wasn't as if we could look down and say "Oh ok I had the steak, and a salad" It was "Who had the Kinoko Nabe, Sakana Mushi, Ebi etc.". This needs to be fixed ASAP, especially for a restaurant such as this.
