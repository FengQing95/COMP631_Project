The Pit Room////Great spot for a casual bbq dinner! Very clean, staff really cares about their customers and its reasonably priced. I've had their pulled pork taco, brisket sandwich and mac n cheese. The sandwich was definitely better than Rudy's or other bbq chains in Texas. The taco was good, but a little small for 4.50. Everything else was perfect!
