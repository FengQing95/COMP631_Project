JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Once you patiently wait through the line to be seated, their ramen is worth it. Or if you're lucky, the bar is open seating and first come/first serve, and does offer the full menu to eat. I generally switch between ordering their tonkatsu black or their spicy umami miso ramen. The tonkatsu black is good if you want a strong flavored pork broth with chashu and an egg without being spicy. But the spicy umami miso ramen is good if you like the richness of miso with the kick of spice. You can ask for their spice level to be mild, medium, hot, or if you're a hot head like me, I ask for it to be double inferno level spice. No matter what you order though, I'm sure you'll be pleased. The service is great at this location as well.
