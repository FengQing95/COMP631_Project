Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is always delicious at Snooze. The service is also good here. It is a small location and parking can be a challenge on busy days. There is a small parking lot but street parking is available as well. The wait is always long so I would recommend joining the yelp wait list before heading over to the restaurant. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It is definitely one of our favorite breakfast spots. I usually always get the snooze classic because I love the hash browns. My kids love the pancakes.
