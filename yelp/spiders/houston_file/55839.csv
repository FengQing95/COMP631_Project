Kata Robata////Went the other night to try somewhere different since we always go to Uchi for sushi. This was near our house and it looked nice from the outside.. we were pleasantly surprised! The toro, yellow tail, tuna and salmon we ordered was so fresh. We sat at the bar and the sushi chefs were very friendly. Great experience!! we will definitely be back there to try the rest of the menu. Highly recommend it!
