Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First and foremost, I think that this place is awesome. However, my recent experience here changed my attitude towards this place. First, Yelp categorized you all as a "gluten-free" option. It's not. Second, having to wait for a cappuccino for almost 20 minutes it's pretty outrageous. Furthermore, the cappuccino was more like simple coffee rather than an actual cappuccino. I really like interior and the atmosphere. There pretty good at taking people's orders but not getting them out on a timely fashion.
