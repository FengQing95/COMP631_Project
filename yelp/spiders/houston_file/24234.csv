Uchi////Servings are admittedly small but the quality is incredible, and each bite is a complete experience. I walked in expecting to spend at least $400 (my husband can EAT) and couldn't believe it when the check showed up and, including dessert, champagne, beer, and maybe 3-4 small bottles of hot sake, the damage was only $290. Needless to say, we tipped the hell out of the amazing Paolo, and he returned the love with a complimentary seasonal dessert and a $25 gift card for our next visit!
