Kata Robata////I have been meaning to try this place for a while now and I finally got to! I had heard nothing but good things about Kata Robata and I was not let down at all. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered their Sushi Platter and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of sushi you get for the platter itself. I am so used to going to places that charge over #30 and you end up getting just a few pieces of fish and an enormous California roll to fill you up so this was a nice change.
