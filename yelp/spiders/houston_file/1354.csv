JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We just had dinner there and the lychee martini was delicious. The service was great! I had the vegetable ramen which had so many veggies: mushrooms, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and greens. The crispy chicken was crunchy and the chicken was moist inside. We tried the brussels sprouts tempura which was sounded strange at first but turned out to be really delicious! The best was their Annin Tofu, so creamy and smooth with fresh fruits on top! The atmosphere is lively. Great place to bring friends just to hang out.
