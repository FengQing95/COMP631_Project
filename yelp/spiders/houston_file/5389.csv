JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have always wanted to try this establishment out since 2014, but I never got the chance to until recently. I came for a quick dinner with two of my friends and while they ordered ramen, I ordered a Pork Chashu bowl. The wait was not long even though the restaurant was jam packed. I cannot even express how delicious the rice bowl was. I'm salivating (not literally hehe) just thinking about it. JINYA is a must visit! On a side note, my friends frequent this place now.
