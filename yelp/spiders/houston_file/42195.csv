Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I almost wrote a bad review so the line wouldn't be so long.  This is the best bakery in town, hands down.  France-quality croissants!   When I'm eating sugar, the chocolate chip cookie is off-the-charts fantastic!  My current fave - sprouted sourdough.  My request to CB is that they make more sprouted breads.
