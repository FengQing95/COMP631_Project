Kata Robata////I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review, since I've been eating here for years. Kata is one of my fave sushi spots in town, but they also have amazing "kitchen food" like oxtail ramen, miso cod, and lobster mac & cheese - just to name a few. They used to have a sea bass that i loved, but it's no longer on the menu. Regardless, everything I've had there has been delicious!
