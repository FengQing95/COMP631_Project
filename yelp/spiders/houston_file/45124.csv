Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Opening up at 7a, this place was crowded and happening moments after the doors opened. My friend and I were able to order quickly and secure a seat, but it's great that we came at the time we did, otherwise, we would have had to eat in the car! It's Friday for goodness sake's! Do these people work? (Don't judge me, since I'm not working either today!)
