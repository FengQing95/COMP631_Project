Baby Barnaby's////Baby Barnaby's is a nice breakfast place that provides you with standard breakfast entrees. Pancakes, waffles, eggs, you name it and they probably have it. I have to say though, I do thoroughly enjoy their fruity pancakes (banana walnut in particular). I have also had their english muffins, but it was kind of a sorry piece of toast looking thing (APPARENTLY ENGLISH MUFFIN ISNOT A MUFFIN... yeah i am not very 'cultured').
