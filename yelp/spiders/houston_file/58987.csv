Baby Barnaby's////Somehow I've managed to live in Houston a year and a half -- part of it within walking distance of Fairview -- and not previously make it to Baby Barnaby's, which I gather is the city's premier "cheap breakfast/brunch" spot. (I did go to Barnaby's on W. Gray earlier this fall, desiring breakfast food and mistakenly thinking that the two had the same menu. Silly me!)
