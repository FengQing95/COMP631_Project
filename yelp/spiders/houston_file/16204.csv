JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////With the wait I had to get to the restroom. And I must say the guy in front of me was really exfoliating his inner self. The problem with him being in there so long is that the restroom really only serves one person. So I waited... To my surprise the restroom was very clean and free from anything foul in the air.
