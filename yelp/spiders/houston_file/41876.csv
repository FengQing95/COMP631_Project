Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is awesome! Their croissants are incredibly delicious and their walnut chocolate chip cookie is a must try! I had their pain perdu, which was well made, but a little too sweet as it was drenched in maple syrup. This place is a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth trying at least once. Make sure to get there early as they do tend to sell out of pastries.
