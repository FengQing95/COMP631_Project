Kata Robata////My first time at this place was a spectacular Â experience! Lily #5 was our waitress and she was excellent. She was patient, friendly and personable and all her recommendations were fantastic. It's a beautiful and trendy restaurant that offers complimentary valet parking. We had sushi and the spicy ramen, everything was delicious. Don't forget to make reservations! This place was busy on a Friday night. I will be back!
