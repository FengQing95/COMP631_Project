Baby Barnaby's////The first time we went here I got the green eggs and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I think it was a texture thing for me, the flavor was really good though. Â The chicken sausage was to die for. The second time I went here I knew where I went wrong and got the breakfast plate and it was delish! The potatoes are amazing! Love the OJ also. I just really like their breakfast.
