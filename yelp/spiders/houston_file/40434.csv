Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everything was delicious!! My personal fav was the shrimp & grits! Everyone else loved the fried steak. My husband swallowed the donut burger in about 3 minutes. He said it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches he'd ever had. The fruity pebble French toast is about what you'd expect, I thought the bread was a little hard for French toast but the flavors were delish. We'll be back for sure! Awesome place to bring out of town guests!!
