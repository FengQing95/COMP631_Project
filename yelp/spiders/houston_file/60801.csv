Baby Barnaby's////Place isn't to bad, came on a off day Tuesday.  People were friendly and was hoping for a bad ass meal.  Now in there defense I ordered the chicken fried steak not there specialty.  It was horrible, the presentation and the way it looked I thought it came from heaven.  I will be back again for the Green Eggs which is what they say is the best, in which case I might have to edit this.  For now 3 for the food and 5 for the service.
