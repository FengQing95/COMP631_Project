Kata Robata////Went here with a colleague for lunch.  I had Roll Combo A which included a CA roll, spicy tuna roll, Houston roll AND a small salad for $12.  Great deal although all 3 of the rolls had similar taste and texture.  They were all good but not outstanding.  The salad had bright ginger dressing and I loved that the lettuce was small-enough pieces to eat with chopsticks.  Next time I'll go for dinner and try the sake flights and specialty rolls.
