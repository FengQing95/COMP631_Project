Baby Barnaby's////Oh sweet baby Jeezzuss. I love Baby Barnaby's. I've been there a couple of times now, and I love their food. Though there might be a wait, I believe that it is worth the wait. The place is small to begin with and there really isn't much of a parking lot, so you need to park on the streets next by it. They are dog friendly; both times I went, I saw that people brought their dogs along with them. Also, the owner (or so I believe is the owner) even provides water for them. :) Though there really isn't an official wait staff coming by to check up on you, it didn't bother me much. Just flag them down, and they'll help you out to the best of their ability.
