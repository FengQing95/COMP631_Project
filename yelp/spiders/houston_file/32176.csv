Local Foods////Love, love, love!  There really isn't anything I've had here that I didn't love.  I've personally had the crunchy chicken, gulf shrimp & blue crab, truffled egg salad, and Asian chicken salad.  The salads are huge!  My friends have enjoyed the falafel and banh mi too.  Even my husband, who is a picky eater, really liked his truffled egg salad with posole on the side.  You can't go wrong with the homemade chips and any soup.
