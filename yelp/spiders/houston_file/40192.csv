Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had the bosscat burger the chefs way, and it was good. But not $14 good and it doesn't come with fries??? No... That's ridiculous. Fries cost pennies. But here it is $6. Lol, $20 for a burger and fries. Pass. Pass. Pass. Tried the BC press and it was good but also overpriced(~$15). The drink ( tall old fashioned) was also $15 and was just okay.
