JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Our pork chashu, which is made from pork belly, is by design a boneless cut of fatty meat. One recommendation is to swap out the pork chashu for chicken chashu, which is lean, sliced chicken breast. Also, you are correct: our "seasoned eggs," as they are listed on the menu, are flash boiled, set in an ice bath for several hours, peeled, an then marinated for 48 hours. Another suggestion is to request a hard-boiled egg, or a non-marinated egg. It may take extra time, but we will always accommodate a customers' request if it is within our power to do so.
