Uchi////Great food, great atmosphere and good service. I do not mind expensive restaurants as long as the whole experience is worth it. We decided to have the chef send us some kind of tasting menu, we were a party of four and we tried at least 12-14 menu items along with a bottle of rose so the check was pretty hefty. I would not recommend this place for a casual dinner. This is a special occasion kinda restaurant. I see some two star reviews around here and I can see why. Because if you don't have a great experience you can feel upset once you get the check.
