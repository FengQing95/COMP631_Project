Kata Robata////Reason behind the rating: food was fantastic, but knocked off a star for 1) the more "standard fare" such as spicy tuna/spicy salmon rolls were only okay, 2) some of the food was quite overpriced, and 3) service could have been a bit more attentive. While the waitstaff was kind and knowledgeable, one of the things I pay attention to is how often my water gets refilled.
