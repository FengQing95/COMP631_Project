Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got the sweet potato hash and the pancake flight. The hash was topped with 2 perfectly cooked sunny-side up eggs and the flight includes 3 of your choice of their fairly large and flavorful pancakes (we chose the pumpkin spice, sweet potato, and their daily pancake - chocolate and pretzels)! Their coffee is pretty on point as well!
