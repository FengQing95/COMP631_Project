Uchi////A faithful reiteration of its original in Austin, Uchi Houston is a premium restaurant destination serving inspired Japanese-style small plates with consistency and the popularity to match. This was my second visit to this location, and significantly better than my first. Neither a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant nor an Asian fusion concept that takes it too far, Uchi manages to serve dishes that respect the concept of authenticity while also pushing the boundaries of Japanese cuisine. Everyone says this, and its for good reason: make sure to come during happy hour!
