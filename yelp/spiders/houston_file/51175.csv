Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very decent breakfast spot in H-town. The chocolate pancakes were delicious and not overloaded with chocolate like most other places do. the bacon could have been a literally warmer and a tad bit crispier. The hash browns we're good , but nothing that kicks u off of your feet. The hot cocoa was the star of the show tbh...probably the best hot chocolate I've ever had at a breakfast spot..or just in general.
