Uchi////Uchi is tapas-style like Underbelly, but with fish. It's all about fusion dishes, where each dish has a particular combination of 2-4 ingredients. Most combinations, like the Hama Chili, the fried brie, and the brussel sprouts with thai chili, were very good. Some, like the hamachi with orange slices, were mediocre. They bring you one dish at a time, and there is a short speech associated with each dish about why they think it's awesome.
