Kata Robata////Absolutely adore this place. Ate here almost every week when I lived in Houston and still go when I visit. Perfect ambiance for date night. I've never received bad service here just be sure to reserve on the weekends because it does it get super busy. The wagyu skewers,  lobster mac and cheese and lychee martinis are amazing. I'm a sushi snob and they always deliver the best!!  Cheers :D
