JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, which imo was on par with Tatsuya at best. The broth was a bit too thick for my liking, and the noodle just a tad bit overcooked. The Char-siu was not melt-in-your-mouth. The biggest letdown, however, was the soft-boiled egg which was almost cooked through, a first in my ramen experience. I guess my expectation was too high. 2/5
