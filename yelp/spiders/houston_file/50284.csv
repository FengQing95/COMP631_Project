Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was a little on the slower side, meaning we had to ask for our first glass of water twice as our waiter was super busy. I was a little confused when we first came in, there is a counter that says please enjoy coffee while you wait, but only water was present. There were a lot of other servers/helpers around that were also very helpful to us.
