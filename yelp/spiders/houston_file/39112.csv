Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came in with a group of 15 for a birthday party. We were kinda skeptical about because we weren't entirely impressed with brunch last time but hey, it's a whiskey bar and also dinner might be a little different. Well, we were really glad we gave it a try because everything we ordered turned out delicious!
