Uchi////On to the food, our party of three had the Hama chilli (not to be missed), edamame (veryy blistered and charred. If you are not a fan skip that), fried Brie (yummy!), zero sen roll (yummy), wagyu hot rock (skip this), chicken (probably tied for best thing of the night with Hama chili. Not to be missed!), crispy tuna roll (good but forgettable, probably a skip), fried milk (crazy good.. order more of the fried milk pieces)
