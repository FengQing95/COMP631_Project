Kata Robata////My wife and I came here for a date night.  We shared the mixed ceviche, kobe skewers, and pork gyoza.  She had the Longhorn maki, and I had nigiri sushi (salmon, yellowtail, and chopped scallop).  The mixed ceviche was the best thing we ordered: the leche de tigre was good, and we liked the combination of octopus and white fish.  The kobe beef was tender and delicious, so I'd also recommend that.  However, we really came to order sushi, but we weren't impressed by either the maki or the nigiri sushi.  All the food prices were high.  At least the ceviche and the kobe were tasty.  The sushi wasn't anything special, so we didn't think it was worth the price tag.
