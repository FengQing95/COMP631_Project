Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although the parking and wait made me question whether this was worth waiting for and after my first sip of coffee, mimosa and first bite...the answer is yes. The service was phenomenal and the food was incredible. All was decently priced and I would gladly wait another hour and a half for Snooze.
