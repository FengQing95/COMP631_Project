Kata Robata////We were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. We have had only one other experience where we enjoyed eating sushi in Houston and that was Uchi. This place was just as good! Service from Thai also made it even better. We thoroughly enjoyed the Texas roll with the hamachi, smoked salmon with yuzu, wagyu sando, lobster mac n cheese and green tea cheesecake. I know it may seem odd to order mac n cheese at a Japanese restaurant but it was only $20 and so it was worth it. Only gripe would that they should use a cavatappi pasta IMO. The only thing I regretted ordering was the Kakuni pork, it was meh. Presentation for all dishes were beautiful. It's pretty loud here, kinda felt like I was back in Vegas (not a bad thing at all just for those who want a quiet intimate dinner, you won't get that here).
