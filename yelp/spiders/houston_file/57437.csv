Kata Robata////FINALLY. FINALLY. FINALLY. Cannot tell you how long I waited for a true great Japanese restaurant in Houston. I know, Uchi is the gold standard... IF you like mango sauces and fruit mixed up with your Japanese dishes. I'm a purist and just want the freshest fish. This is it in Houston.
