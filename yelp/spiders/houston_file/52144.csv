Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The corned beef hash had chunks of corned beef mixed with hash browns and topped with eggs made your way.  Word to the wise here. If you ask for "over easy ", they'll be served with a very runny yolk.  Ask for "over easy medium" for a little more firm center. Great flavor.
