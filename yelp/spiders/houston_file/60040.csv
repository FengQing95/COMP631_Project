Baby Barnaby's////FOOD: Ordered the corn beef hash and migas. The hash was good, but not as good as the migas. Try the migas! House potatoes came with both plates. They were crunchy and delicious. Coffee was good, nice breakfast blend and not watery. Next time I will order a juice, I didn't realize they were freshly squeezed.
