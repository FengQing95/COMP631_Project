The Pit Room////The food... where do I even start?! We tried the fatty briskets, beef rib, and the cheddar jalapeño sausage with sides of elote, mac and cheese, and the chili. The meats are smoked to perfection - super juicy, accurate ratio of fat vs meat, and all the right flavors! Something that stood out to me was that the chili is made bean-free, apparently a Texas thing!
