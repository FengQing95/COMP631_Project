Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We tried this place in Orange County and again here and it was consistently delicious. Pancakes (esp lemon and sweet potato) were amazing, French toast (OMG) was so rich without being overly sweet, Bennys wereall so savory with great clean flavors. Coffee was perfect (and we're coffee snobs). One small complaint was it was so darn loud at both places. Otherwise, it's our new fave breakfast place.
