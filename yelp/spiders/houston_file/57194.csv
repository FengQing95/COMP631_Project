Kata Robata////There is two dishes in particular that my husband and I love. 1st is the Miso Eggplant with Garlic Sushi Rice. Please do yourself a favor and order this dish. The rice was crispy and fragrant, the eggplant was deliciously topped with miso sauce that perfectly rounded off the dish. Second is the Texas Kobe Beef Skewers. WOW, these melt in your mouth and are so juicy. The quality of the meat is top notch.
