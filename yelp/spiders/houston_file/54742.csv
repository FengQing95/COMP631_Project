Kata Robata////- Miso Crusted Bone Marrow ($14) - dijon mustard seeds, pickled onions, panko, red miso, bonito flakes. This is beef bone marrow. It was so tasty. We put the marrow on the bread and drizzled with sea salt, the mustard seeds. FATTY goodness. We were so glad we ordered this, since we definitely won't find this elsewhere. It might be an acquired taste though for some people.
