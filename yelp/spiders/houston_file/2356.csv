JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall, this place wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best ramen in Houston. The atmosphere is great, as it's a good place to come to with friends or with a date, and the food is solid. Just don't come here with the expectations that this place with blow you away.
