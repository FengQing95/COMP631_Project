Local Foods////The chips were a nice shade of orange, however they were too salty for my taste. It had the perfect crunch to it, but if they reduced the salt and added more pepper maybe it would have been a killer! The kale I tried next, it was kale, golden raisins, pine nut, and supposedly cheese (I didn't really feel/taste the cheese) It was bleh too me, but that maybe because I've actually never had kale. This didn't ruin it for me though my genius self somehow ended up using the kale as a chip dip. It was a perfect balance, the kale helped reduce the salty taste, while the chips added flavor and the crunch lacking in the kale.
