Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We decided to split a few appetizers: the pork hush puppies and the pork belly poutine. Both were so worth it and plenty for four people. I'm not a fan of steak fries but the ones in the poutine were super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The proportion between fries, gravy, pork belly, and cheese curds was awesome. So easy to get the perfect bite. The mustard that came with the hush puppies was delicious and I wanted to eat it with everything.
