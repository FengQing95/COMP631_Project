Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here for Sunday brunch and got an awesome spot on their outside patio- great people watching down Westheimer. My boyfriend and I both ordered the ham and egg torta and a croissant. The torta had great flavors- some kind of spicy sauce, avocado, fried egg. Delicious. The only downside was that it was too big to bite and the amount of "gooey" ingredients made the insides slip out- very messy even after cutting it into smaller pieces. The croissants were amazing- better than some I've had in Paris. One of the waiters saw that my boyfriend didn't eat much of his torta and asked if he didn't like it. When he explained the messiness, the waiter brought us a free goodie box of different pastries. Will definitely come back for the baked goods.
