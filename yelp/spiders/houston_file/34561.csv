Local Foods////This is my favorite restaurant for a quick, delicious lunch! The ingredients are fresh and local, and the menu changes seasonally, although certain items (like my favorite Crunchy Chicken Sandwich) are available year-round. The sandwiches, salads, and soups never disappoint, and the dinner features are fantastic as well. I would highly recommend trying out one of their several locations.
