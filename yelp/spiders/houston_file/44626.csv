Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bakery is beautiful. Everything is laid out just perfectly, and the flavors do not disappoint. I would recommend buying a loaf of bread here for the week, as it really is a top-notch bakery. The macaroons are pretty and quite tasty, although they are a little pricy. (I must note that I think macaroons are one of the best ways for places to exploit consumers, a 90% profit margin is justified because they are trendy. This phenomena is exclusive to Common Bond, however, so I don't fault them for hopping on such a profitable endeavor).
