The Pit Room////My wife had the loaded frito pie (intended to be topped with brisket) with green beans and coleslaw. For some reason, the gentleman behind the serving counter put both chili and brisket on the Fritos. They were soggy by the time we sat down to eat. She also didn't like the coleslaw. She found the cabbage soft and flavorless.
