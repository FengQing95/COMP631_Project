Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here with a party of 9 for a friend's birthday. There was a 2 hour wait, which wasn't as bad as expected since Snooze has an assortment of games for people to play with while waiting, such as Connect 4 and Jenga, and a plethora of nearby stores to cool down in. Apparently they also send texts to let you know when your table is ready, but we never received one so I'm not sure how reliable that whole process is.
