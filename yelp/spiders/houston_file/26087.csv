The Pit Room////I had been wanting to try this place for months after seeing all of the good reviews on Yelp, but I was disappointed when I finally got to eat at Pit Room -- maybe my expectations were too high. I had the brisket and venison sausage with mac and cheese and coleslaw as sides, and my father had the pork ribs, venison sausage, cole slaw and potato salad. Both of my meats were pretty dry, but my father really enjoyed his pork ribs. We both agreed that the venison sausage was way too peppery for our liking. The mac and cheese was pretty good, and I enjoyed dipping the bread we were given in it. The cole slaw was also extremely peppery. Overall, the meats were not as tender as I usually like, and the sides were only okay. The Pit Room did not live up to the expectations I had built up for it :(
