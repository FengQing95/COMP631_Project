JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had never eaten ramen (other than top ramens during my college days) prior to coming to Jinya. I was pleased to see they vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. They specifically had two vegan ramen options so I went with the spicy vegan ramen. Tasted similar to chicken soup broth. Very flavorful. Loved the soba noodles. I ordered extra so soak up more of the broth. The tofu was excellent too. Took on the flavor of the broth. I've have since came back twice and cannot wait to go back again.
