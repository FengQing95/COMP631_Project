Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Atmosphere at this place was vibrant.  I liked the concept and had a decent patio too.  Full disclosure, we were sat right next to the door to the kitchen and it had absolutely no buffer, so it felt like we were in the kitchen.  And we were cognizant of the traffic every 10 seconds.
