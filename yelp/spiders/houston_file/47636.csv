Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was amazing!! But even more impressive was their service. They were super friendly and attentive. Prepare to wait if you go after 8, but worth it. Benny Benedict was to die for. Hubby got the burrito and it was massive and he was obviously super happy about it. All around- just go.
