Kata Robata////Overall a great experience from the service to the amazing food with spectacular quality and robust flavors. The menu has lots of great choices for whatever you may be in the mood for whether it is fresh fish or hardier grilled meats. Great place for a date if you are trying to impress! Save room for dessert because they have some unique and tasty options. One of the best places for sushi in Houston.
