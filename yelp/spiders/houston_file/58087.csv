Kata Robata////I ate and highly recommend the Caribbean Roll, Scallop and Foie Gras Sushi, Green Tea Souffle with Red Bean Ice Cream, Warm Blueberry Cake with Lemon Ice Cream, Grilled Oyster Mushrooms, Vegan Soba Salad, Barracuda, Pork Belly and Papaya Salad, Octopus Crudo, Kaluga Caviar and Uni Oysters, and a Chef's Sashimi for Two (asked for the shrimp heads to be fried and got them back freshly hot with lemon to squeeze).
