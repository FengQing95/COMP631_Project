Uchi////The sushi itself is fresh yet they are a little bit overpriced IMO. I personally would prefer going to Seiwa market to buy sashimi there instead of going to Uchi. Nonetheless, the customer service is excellent and the ambiance is not bad, and definitely can be better. I think I will recommend this place if you feel like splurging your money or for a special occasion, and do not care your food is not worth the price tag. One item that I think is worth mentioning is their fried milk dessert, is reasonably price and extremely delicious. Other than that, the sashimi slices are a little bit too thin for the price we are paying for.
