JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jake - Thanks for your feedback. I'm very sorry to hear that you felt rushed during your stay with us. Although we are a high-volume, high-turnover restaurant, that is wholly unacceptable, and I hope that you will accept my apology on behalf of our entire staff. When the wait list grows long in the front, there's a palpable tension that can be felt among our front and back of house, and we do our best not to let that negative energy seep into our service. Unfortunately, from time to time, it does, but we're always striving to do better.
