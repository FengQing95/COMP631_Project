Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was worth the wait! We ordered the The Breakfast Pot Pie, Corned Beef Haag and Snooze Breakfast Burrito, plus the secret Cinnamon Roll Pancake (not on the menu). Big portions and super tasty! We still had food left over! Our server, John was kind and attentive and funny. Definitely will be back!!
