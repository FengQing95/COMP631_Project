The Pit Room////If you only read the first sentence in my review then my one suggestion is to GET the QUESO! It's delicious! We stopped in here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon before heading back to Austin and had a great time. You can order your BBQ a few ways from what I understood - tacos, a la carte and by the pound. I ordered the brisket taco and chicken taco with chips and queso. My husband got brisket, turkey, sausage and pork ribs with mac n cheese, okra and all the fixings. I preferred the brisket taco over the chicken but both were good. I tasted the brisket and it was decent. I really enjoyed their sausage and turkey though. The mac n cheese was super creamy and the okra was somehow cooked perfectly. You know how okra can be kind of slimy? Well this okra had none of that going on - definitely one of the best sides. The chips and queso were so good we went though 3 orders at out table with friends. If you are looking to shake things up you should dip your meat in the queso ... mmmm!
