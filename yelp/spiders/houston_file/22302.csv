Uchi////By far the best place for fresh fish, atmosphere, and service. My first time at Uchi was last year and now I'd say I go at least once every month-two months. Not once have I left disappointed. Although, it is a bit on the pricer side - you will leave feeling like every cent was worth the experience and quality. If the dinner prices throw you off try their happy hour menu - it's equally as amazing.
