JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Linda - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your understanding of our extended wait times during peak hours. We do our best to keep the tables turning. We're all doing our part to add diversity and variety to the local dining scene. I don't know if you could aptly describe Midtown as "a big Asian community," considering we are sandwiched between an Italian pizzeria and Artisan's, which is high-end French-New American cuisine. But we appreciate your kind words nonetheless.
