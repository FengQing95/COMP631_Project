Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has adorable decor, a beautiful layout, and from what I hear, amazing pastries. Unfortunately, I went too late in the day and all that they had left were a few chocolate chip cookies. While the chocolate chip cookie that I had was warm and delectable, it left me curious to try more. I would suggest going no later than early afternoon.
