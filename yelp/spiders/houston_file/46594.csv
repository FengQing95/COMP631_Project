Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond croissant and the morning bun were probably the best things I had. The filling was great. Croissant had a nice chew and wasn't too sweet. The morning bun was described to me as a churro. It tasted more like a croissant covered in cinnamon and sugar. I can see the similarities with a churro, but that's not how I would've described it. I typically love morning buns, and I would describe them as a cross between a cinnamon roll and a croissant. This one had no cinnamon or sugar and the inside, just the outside.
