Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love the location and service! Parking was not fun, had to wait for a little bit and then eventually found a spot! Limited spaces for parking! I went there with a girl friend and we could have easily split the chicken torta as it was a generous portion. Absolutely amazing sandwich. Super delicious! We sat outside and it was a goregous day! The staff were very friendly and attentive! Loved this experience!
