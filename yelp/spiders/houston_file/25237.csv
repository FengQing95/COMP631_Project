Uchi////The best Japanese dining experience I've ever had! What was supposed to be a quick happy hour trip turned into a mini dinner because we just couldn't stop ourselves - a 3-4 course trip ended up including 10! The best part was that we didn't even pick most of our items - that was all on our amazing server Matt. Each of his picks were incredible and are things I would love to eat again. The unique twists on a lot of the dishes, from their pickled wasabi to different elements of crunchy/sweet/sour/etc, were perfect. Each dish added more and more to our experience. It's really hard to pick a favorite, but the Bluefin Flight, Walu Walu, and Hama Chili were notably great. Between Matt's awesome service, the really chill/fun vibes, and the next level food, I can't wait to come back again.
