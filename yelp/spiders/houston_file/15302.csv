JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is always a good choice. My last visit we went in on a Friday night, and had to wait 45 minutes. Not too bad since we found a spot at the bar. Once our table was ready we shifted to our seats. Ramen always good, I would not think there is anything overly special about the Ramen here. Its good, its not too expensive, and there is a great atmosphere.
