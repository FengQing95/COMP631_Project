JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been eating ramen since I was little girl, and even before it was even trendy. This is a great little place to enjoy ramen, and they're very flexible when it comes to options and what you want in your ramen. I am particular on what I put in my ramen, and they were able to accommodate. Prices, well, they're mediocre, but it's Houston, so you're get what you pay for. :) Parking is little crazy though. There is a parking garage next door and don't park where  you're not allowed to park (watch out for the signs) because there is towing company the establishments around the area call and they're around the corner.  You will be towed and all it takes is 15 minutes.
