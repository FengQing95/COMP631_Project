Local Foods////- "Crunchy" Chicken: This name is a little misleading, because the nut crumble and crushed chips give the sandwich a texture that, while pleasant, isn't actually crunchy. It's a great sandwich though and is what I recommend to friends on their first visit. This is literally the only sandwich my husband has gotten in all the years we've been coming here, and he happily refuses to order anything else.
