Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Street side cafe with a order and sit kinda deal. The cafe is a decent size but it does have a lot of tables/chairs which is good except that it can get crowded at peak hours. Small attached patio great for dogs to chill out while you eat, but the patio also can get crowded very easily. At any point we saw at least 2-3 dogs with us, including our own. Tried the pistachio croissant which was an interesting combination and one that I haven't had before. Good cappuccino! Their quiche was great too. The food is slightly above the usual price you would pay for cafe food.
