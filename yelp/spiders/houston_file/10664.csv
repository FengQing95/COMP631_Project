JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Joseph - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your feedback as it only serves to improve our station. I wish you had mentioned your dissatisfaction to your server. We can always prepare a new bowl or suggest an alternative if you're not 100% satisfied with your meal. Our noodles do come in two sizes: thick and thin, and we can always prepare them harder or softer per your request. Lastly, we fry our takoyaki for a set amount of time, and we don't often get criticized for improper cooking.
