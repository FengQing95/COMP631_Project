Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were really looking forward to trying Common Bond but left a bit disappointed. We ordered two pastries to go upon arrival and those were good. We got an oatmeal creme pie and a chocolate chip cookie. We then proceeded to order lunch. A Texas sandwich and shrimp & grits. Overall we felt the food was subpar. But the worst experience we got came down to the service. We encountered 4 employees all in different roles. One who I got the impression was a supervisor and out of all 4 the only one who gave good, respectful service was the cashier (I wish we got his name to give him credit). Overall, not a great experience. Willing to come back and try breakfast entrees but we don't think it lived up to the reputation this place has on the internet.
