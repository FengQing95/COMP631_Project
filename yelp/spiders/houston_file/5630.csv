JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wait was pretty long but it was a Saturday night and it was a busy place, which is normally a good sign for a restaurant. Â Kind of expensive to pay about $10-$15 for a bowl of noodles, but the noodles and meat were prepared well and were very tasty! I ordered the spicy chicken ramen, not very spicey but it was filling. This place can get pricey fast if you like to add a bunch of extras to your ramen, as each one is at least $1 or more.
