Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We knew there would be a wait when we arrived. We were quoted 45 minutes to an hour and we ended up waiting about 1.5 hours because they were running a little behind. We expected this, so it wasn't a big deal. What we didn't expect was having to wait an additional 30 minutes for our food to arrive after we placed our orders.
