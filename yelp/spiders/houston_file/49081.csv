Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They offer free coffee while you wait which is a bonus in my eyes. The restaurant itself is decorated really nicely with bold colors and stylish seating. I fell IN LOVE with their colorful ceramic cups and plates! Their customer service was also really great an amazing. The server that seated us asked us if it was our first time, and said yes. After a couple of minutes of sitting down, he brought us out the pancake of the day - Espresso Chocolate - for us to try, NO CHARGE! It was delicious and I thought it made for a great first experience.
