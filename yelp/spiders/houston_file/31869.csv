Local Foods////Benjy's little brother Local Foods is a good concept.  Actually, I have seen this a lot in New Orleans where you have a fancy sandwich shop right next to your main restaurant.  Makes a lot of sense.  It's ashamed that the food is a little disappointing.  I have actually been to Local Foods a couple of times to attempt to find something I like.  My first trip, I went with the Gulf Shrimp and Blue Crab Sandwich with Green Goddess dressing.  The seafood itself was decent and they do give you an ample amount of crab/shrimp.  However, the ciabatta bread really took away from the experience.  I understand that the bread was meant to be crunchy, but the crust on this bread took it to the extreme.  It made it very difficult to eat.
