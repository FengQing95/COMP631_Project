JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has a special place in my heart, and my belly. I have frequented this place more times than I care to admit. I usually order the Spicy Chicken Ramen with a seasoned egg. It's extra, but you won't regret it on any of their ramen dishes. That's the beauty about this place: you are allowed to add extra toppings or substitutions to suit whatever you are feeling like combining. Some ramen restaurants can give you a hassle for messing with their "perfectly" combined ingredients. Jinya has such good quality broth that you will find satisfaction even with the most unique combinations.
