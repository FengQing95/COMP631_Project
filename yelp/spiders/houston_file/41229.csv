Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I checked our Common Bond today, as I like to coffee shop hop in the area since I don't have an office. Today was my first time visiting. At first, I was a little confused as to where to order my food vs coffee, but I ordered the grilled cheese and a latte and sat down at the bar next to the baristas. I was there for about 5 hours today, as it was super comfy with the chairs they provide for the individuals like myself hanging out with their computers. My latte had gotten cold, so I asked the barista if I could get a cup of ice to turn my latte into an iced latte. He told me he preferred to just make me one on the house, as he was concerned with the food safety aspect of the milk coming to and sitting at room temperature for sometime. And so he did!! Very, very kind of him. I also left at closing with a loaf of bread under my arm, as the barista asked me if I would like one before I left. I suspect they donate these anyway, whatever they don't sell. Not that I expect free stuff by visiting again, but I just thought these nice little personal touches brightened up my day. My only critiques: I wish they had a half portion of the grilled cheese - though tasty, too much for one person and I would have bought something sweet instead to make up for the cost anyway. The other thing, I didn't see any power plugs near the bar for those of us sitting and working, but I didn't check around the corner. Definitely still deserves a 5 star for customer service today!
