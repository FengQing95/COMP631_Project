JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The seating here is a crap shoot if you want to have your own table.  They have this long table that you could possible end up literally sitting next to a stranger.  I don't pay good money to eat dinner with a stranger literally elbow to elbow with me! Not to mention you can't even have a private conversation. Their food is overpriced.
