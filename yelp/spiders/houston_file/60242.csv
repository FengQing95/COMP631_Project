Baby Barnaby's////This one of my favorite breakfast spots in Houston. I typically order their breakfast plate which is just your choice of eggs, meat, breakfast potatoes, and either toast or biscuits. Can't go wrong with a classic! Service is very quick and always friendly. I visit quite frequently but usually very early during the week. If you want to stop in on the weekend and have brunch be prepared for a wait.
