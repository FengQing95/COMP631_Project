Uchi////I'm a big fan of raw fish and the selection they had that night was from Japan's Toyosu Market. It was ALL phenomenal. A few of my favorites from the special was the Loup De Mer (Mediterranean Bass), Shima Aji (Striped Jack), Masaba (Japanese Mackerel), and the Bluefin Otoro (Fatty Tuna). The taste of the Otoro was indescribable. Super fatty with every bite, Super delicious. I enjoyed the Engawa (Flounder Fin Muscle) too because I enjoy the slightly torched taste. I wish I could write about all of the specials, but then I'd be writing a book! Lol, feel free to contact me for any requests!
