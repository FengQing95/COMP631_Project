Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Good service abounds here and I will no doubt return but my first visit was less than stellar. The pork sandwich just felt like it was in need of tweaking. In a word, unremarkable. Just lacking a bite of something tart, sweet, or sour just to set off the savory only sandwich. The waitress brought out some BBQ mayonnaise which brought it more to life. The sweet potato mac and cheese, if I had taken it home, would have been subjected to a redo complete with maple bacon chips, blue cheese and some lightly saut√©ed onions . Again just shy of wonderful. Drink was spot on with a generous pour, and the chicken flatbread was flawless. I don't mind spending $60 on myself once in a great while when the fare is more than fair so next time I'll bring the hot sauce.
