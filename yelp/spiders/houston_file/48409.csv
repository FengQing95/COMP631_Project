Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I always come here, the food is amazing and it always helps having a monthly pancake ! I got the pumpkin spice latte pancake ! Amazing! Teresa the bartender is my absolute favorite, always spunky, in a good mood, and very good at her job. I came to get some mimosas, (half off booze on Monday's n Tuesday's for industry ) today is my day off and everything about this place improved my day. Thank you !
