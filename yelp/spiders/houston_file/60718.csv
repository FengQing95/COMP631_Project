Baby Barnaby's////My fianc√© and I went to eat here for brunch on a Saturday. We added our name to the list - there was a slight 10 to 15 minute wait so we helped ourselves to coffee and water in the outdoor waiting area. One of the waiters outside was friendly and greeted us upon arrival. The inside is very small but still comfortable with a friendly vibe.
