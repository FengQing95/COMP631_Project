Local Foods////After already loving the brownie, we finally had our meals... man I really thought my steak sandwich would give me a heart attack but the chefs had the sense to throw in the perfect vegetable to cut the sodium of the meats: a THICK tomato slice. Sounds pointless, but when you're biting down on the bits of savory and salty goodness, a nice juicy tomato is the perfect way to mellow out the intensity. The egg sandwich that my friend ordered was nice too (but mine was better :) ).
