Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Thank you for the glowing review and giving us several opportunities to show you what we are all about.  I completely understand your logic and I too tend to look for those in the middle, but lets not make a habit out of it ha ha ( I am kidding).  Your review couldn't be more in line with our goals as a new restaurant.  The people of Houston have been so good to us and I thank you.
