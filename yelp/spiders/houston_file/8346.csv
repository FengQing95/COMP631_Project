JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm comparing this to LA ramen bars. This was a meh experience. Noodles were a tad soggy. Soup didnt have that richness and flavor I'm looking for. Karaage (fried chicken) was a sad and depressing treat. Somehow you managed to make the chicken soggy as soon as it got to the table... but it was over cook? I was a tad confuse. We were passing though and was hoping for some comfort food but this was more of a patch until I make it to LA to have my fix.
