The Pit Room////Stupid good! Â Drove straight here from the airport, 35 minutes through a torrential downpour & lightning storm. Would do it again it a heartbeat! Can't decide if the brisket or venison sausage is better. It doesn't matter. My mouth is happy! Czech sausage is amazing too. I don't know, you decide.
