Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is well worth the wait. I went to brunch with my roommate and her parents. We arrived at about 9:00am. The place was packed, with people patiently waiting. We were seated outdoors which I didn't mind. I don't remember the name of our waiter but it didn't take him long to take our order. I tasted the slamming pumpkin pancakes I mean how could I not. I also got a side of their a la carte tacos. I drizzled some of the yellow bird hot sauce. OH MY HEAVENS!!!! You can taste the freshness of the cage free eggs, and the green sauce was the perfect touch. The pumpkin pancakes were so good. My taste buds were dancing. And then i wanted to try the hash browns because of the way they were shaped. There was plenty for leftovers, which is always my favorite. I was so satisfied :)
