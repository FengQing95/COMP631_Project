The Pit Room////I love that you can eat it at the patio on Richmond next door!  The BBQ was good, but not the best I have ever had.  The fatty brisket (not a huge fan of lean) which was alright, but a little dry.  Their BBQ sauce is tangy which was good and their mustard was a little sweet but worked well with their sausage.  I can't gage any of the sides because we only tried the brisket, chicken, venison sausage, and beef sausage.  All in all it was decent BBQ, just not a WOW moment.
