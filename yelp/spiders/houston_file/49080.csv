Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got there around 10:40 am on a Thursday and our wait for two was 25 minutes. We noticed that people really started coming in around 11 am so be sure to get there before that if you don't want to wait too long! As for parking, I had to park about a 2 minute walk away by CVS because the small lot for Snooze was absolutely packed! Unless you really don't want to walk a few extra feet, I'd recommend not even trying to get into the parking lot and parking on the street.
