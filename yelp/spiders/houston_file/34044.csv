Local Foods////I ordered the Truffle Egg salad sandwich on a pretzel bun with a side of Tuscan Kale (my fav) and a quinoa side.  The side of quinoa was not too special to me...it definitely had bits of cilantro in it and I don't remember the menu saying it had cilantro in it or I would have avoided it. The tuscan kale was amazing as usual..next time I'll just order two sides of kale.  The truffle egg salad sandwich was HUGE.  You really need a plan of attack on how to eat this thing without the egg salad pieces falling out.  Each bite was so satisfying...the truffle egg salad and the amazing crunch from the delicious pretzel bun.  It was so very filling!!
