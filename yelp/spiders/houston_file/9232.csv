JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Luisa - Thank you very much for the great review. I agree that loud music is not for everyone. In fact, I prefer dinner over soft music; however, JINYA's restaurant concept is geared towards a trendy, loud atmosphere. And this, unfortunately, is one of the many guidelines we are legally bound to follow as a JINYA franchise. Nevertheless, thank you for understanding.
