Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Greeted by friendly, knowledgeable staff. Went around 6pm on a week night. Not crowded at all but it was the day before Thanksgiving. All of our desserts were exceptional. Husband loved the Turtle Brownie. Hands down the best Americano coffee I have ever had! Only wish I lived closer.
