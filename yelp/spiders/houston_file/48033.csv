Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We visited this place on a Friday morning, and waited for 20-30min to be seated. Their parking is horrible because they only have 10-12 spots for the entire place. I saw some People park on the street, but it is such an inconvenient location for such a popular breakfast place.
