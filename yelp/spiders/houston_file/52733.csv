Kata Robata////Kata Robata has great service, from the hostess to the waiting staff. I ordered the Chefs choice sushi for two and it was one of the best sushi that I have ever had. The sushi quality was very fresh, I did not get to try any of the special rolls but I will be back soon. The restaurant setting is also very nice and relaxing.
