Uchi////This is my absolute favorite Japanese restaurant and among my top 3 in Houston! The place is hip and fun, the service is exceptional, and the food is always great. Their best dishes are the hama chili- baby yellowtail in ponzu sauce with a hint of spiciness is a great start; the walu walu is a wonderful oak grilled escolar that I always order, and it is especially great for those who don't like raw fish; and the zero sen yellowtail with fried shallot adds crunchiness to this soft and balanced dish. And everyone I've been here with really enjoyed the brussels sprouts-it's crispy, sweet and tangy, and goes really well with rice. Everything at Uchi is fresh and beautifully made and served that even their side of rice is good. For the taste and quality of food, Uchi is perfectly priced.
