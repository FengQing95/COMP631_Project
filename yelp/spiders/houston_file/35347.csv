Local Foods////I came in @1130 am and was one of the first people there. I think the owner welcomed me in.  The workers all wore masks.  They have packaged food to go including beef curry , chicken shawarma, and their outstanding crunchy chicken .  Also yummy cheese plates!  And a menu for the day.  It got busy noonish.
