The Pit Room////ordered the 2 meat + sides, chicken was good, brisket was great. juicy moist. wanted to try a mix of cuts, however the person cutting the meat was not accommodating and had us pick one or the other. Other than that id give it a 4*. Sides were great as well. Would definitely come back.
