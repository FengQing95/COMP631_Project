Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////When my food came out I asked for a glass of water since my drink had been empty for a while. She decided instead to make other people's drinks and forgot about my water. I had to ask her two more times. She was apparently to busy flirting with the guy beside me and the other male servers to do her job. I would try this place again for the food but seriously train your staff better. They need to pay attention to all the customers not just ones they want to flirt with.
