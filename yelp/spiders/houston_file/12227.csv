JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As for me and my other friend, we both got one of different chicken ramen bowls. We all also ordered fried brussel sprouts. I actually do not eat brussel sprouts but these were good! For my chicken ramen, I did add fried onions and would later get extra noodles for $2.50. We were all stuffed by end.
