Kata Robata////* Green tea souffle cheesecake with adzuki bean ice cream AND banana creme brulee with Nutella cream (9th). Supposed to be one or the other, but we got both just because :) I was thinking I would prefer the souffle cheesecake, but the creme brulee absolutely knocked my socks off. I CAN'T EVEN Y'ALL the creme brulee was brilliant.
