Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I first heard about Snooze via Instagram promotions in conjunction with local foodie IG accounts, and I was curious to see what the hype was about. The hour or so wait for a table for 2 on a mid-August Sunday for late brunch/lunch, though bordering absurd, definitely gave me confidence in the place. The people of Houston know their food. The only other inconvenience would be the parking; definitely expect to park along the lanes of the adjacent residential areas if you come at peak hours.
