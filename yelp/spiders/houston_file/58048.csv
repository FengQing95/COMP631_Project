Kata Robata////I'm not much of a sushi or seafood person but I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. A lot of my friends love sushi rave about this place, and I can enjoy the wagyu and egg items just as much as they enjoy their sushi! Win win for everyone. The wagyu was out of this world. The mac and cheese can be made without lobster and was amazing. Looking forward to coming back
