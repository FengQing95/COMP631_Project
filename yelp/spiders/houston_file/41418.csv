Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's too euro-lounge and nearly trimmed...brightly lit, rubber stamp design inside and ultra clean. What makes that area of Houston so great are places like Brasil, Empire, Agora... Cracks in the floors, lowly lit, handmade, artistic vibe, eclectic, dirty and proud of it. This bakery is very out of place and feels like someone proudly dropped a Starbucks or a Chipotle in the middle of a great hipster intersection.
