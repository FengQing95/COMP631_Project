The Pit Room////The Pit Room was recommended to me by a co-worker and now she's become a trusted food advisor.  It's really good BBQ in the Upper Kirby zone.  You will have to get there a little earlier to get your hands on the better cuts (ribs/brisket) but it's not necessary to camp outside before the doors open
