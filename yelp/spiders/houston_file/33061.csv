Local Foods////Wow! Â The reviews for this place are not exaggerated!!! LOVED seeing some vegan options in Houston and the flavored of the quinoa burger were incredible. The flavor and texture weren't made to mimic meat, it seemed, but made the "burger" something new and incredible! The watermelon gazpacho was out of this world!!! If you were looking for a modern, clean, awesome business in the downtown area with delectable food, this is a place you must visit!!!
