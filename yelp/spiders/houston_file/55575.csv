Kata Robata////Bone marrow - please don't order bone marrow and pork belly in one meal like we did. It was a horrible idea. Too much fat and cholesterol for dinner. I suspected the pork belly might have also ruined my bone marrow experience. Since my tongue just tasted something that has lots of flavors, the bone marrow that came after felt plain and pretty much tasteless. Like we were just eating fat on a piece of bread.
