JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Today's visit was not as delightful as the times before. The wait time was a bit shorter than usual for dinner rush, and the hostesses were prompt and eager to attend customers walking in. We got seated and our order was quickly taken. While the food was as good as other times, I felt rushed while eating. I stopped eating for a minute to talk to my friend and the waiter took that as the cue to ask if we needed to-go boxes. Since my friend was getting full and was not going to finish her food, we said yes. However, as soon as he came back with the containers, he immediately poured the ramen into the container without asking my friend if she was done eating. She was still going to eat more but didn't get the chance to. We paid for our tab and we had just stood up and were gathering our things when there was already someone cleaning the table. Though I understand that there's many people waiting to eat during rush hour, I did not appreciate being rushed to eat a meal I paid for, especially after I waited a good amount of time to be seated.
