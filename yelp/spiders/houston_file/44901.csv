Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Can I just tell you this place how much this place blew my mind?!! I came here on a weekday during lunch, but was really looking for one thing in particular--the chocolate chip, walnut cookie. I've seen the photos. I felt it had to be good, and it was; it really was! The cookie had been everything I have dreamt of since 2013 when I went to Levain Bakery in NYC. Since that time, I haven't come across a cookie that good...until now! Thank goodness Houston has blessed us with a cookie exactly like it!
