Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is worth the 4.5 stars people have rated it no question.  We got the kimchi pork thingys - the pig candy - and I normally hate Asian fusion - either be Asian, or be non-Asian.  But this was a great balance.  And the portobello fries?  Yeah they sucked.  NOT.  Thin batter, great crisp, great softness on the inside.  Thumbs up!!!
