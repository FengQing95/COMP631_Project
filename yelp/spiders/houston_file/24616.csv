Uchi////They score their fish so that they can add soy sauce and other sauces to it and have it imparted without you dipping and ruining the experience. In fact, there was no soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger to be found. It was a refreshing experience. All of the food I ordered was fresh and mouthwatering, beginning with the small scoop of sorbet they provide before your meal. The bluefin otoro simply melts in your mouth as well.
