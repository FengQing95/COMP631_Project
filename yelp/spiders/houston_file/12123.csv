JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jeena - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry we were not able to provide the Crispy Kale Lollipops. We have had to discontinue the item at both of our locations, and coupled with several more changes we're making to our menu, a final reprint is taking a little longer than expected. Thank you for bearing with us. On a separate note, can you shed a little more light on the supbar service you received? I would like to provide constructive criticism to our servers so they can learn from mistakes or focus on areas that need improvement. Also, in the future, you can always request "Less Salt" or "Less Oil" in any of our ramen broths. We will do everything in our power to customize your bowl as you see fit. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
