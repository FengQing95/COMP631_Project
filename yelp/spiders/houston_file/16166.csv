JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We do understand that the term "spicy," especially in Houston, is subjective. What is spicy for some is extremely mild to others and vice versa. Regardless, we always encourage our guests to notify their servers of any issues whatsoever with their meal so that management can remake, replace or remove the item from your tab. We seek 100% satisfaction with every item we serve. Thank you again for your visit,
