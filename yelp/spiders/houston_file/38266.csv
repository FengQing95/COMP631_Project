Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Quite possibly my favorite place in Houston for unique and tasty bar appetizers. The mushroom fries are to die for and the spicy chicken dip is amazing- even though I don't typically like spicy, this is just right. I always suggest this place if I'm able. Be warned. It's busy right after work around the large bar.
