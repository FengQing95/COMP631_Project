Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is one of my favorite cafes! I love their atmosphere and sky high windows that let in plenty of natural light. The treats are also delicious and well made, the chocolate chip cookie is my favorite to pair with my coffee. I come here pretty often and I am glad they extended their hours!
