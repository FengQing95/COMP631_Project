Uchi////To some it up: Pricey, but worth it if your looking for a fresh, artistic, flavorful unique Sushi/seafood experience. Uptown Sushi used to be a favorite for creative fresh Sushi, but Uchi, has set the bar higher and made it more affordable if you take advantage of the great Sake Social deals.
