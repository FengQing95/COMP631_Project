Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went today for lunch and it was just average and super expensive for something so average. We were there at an off time and there weren't many people there, yet just to order took forever!! Their system for ordering is really unorganized and customer service was horrible. We were thinking at least the food would be good. Nope. Just average and it too took forever to arrive at our table. I can't even imagine what this system looks like at a high lunch hour. The latte was good is about all I can say. Won't be returning.
