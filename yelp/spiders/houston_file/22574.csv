Uchi////I was surprised when two dessert dishes came out,  my friend then told me she had slipped a note to the waitress informing her it was my birthday.  So for dessert we had the peanut butter semifreddo & fried milk. A great way to end the night & birthday experience with an extra surprise dessert.
