Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Omg! I had the shrimp and grits and I've literally been craving it ever since I had a chai latte and it was so delicious! I also had a little strawberry pistachio desert but I can't remember what it's called but it was perfect! I cannot wait to go back and try more yummy things!
