Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////From what I can tell the crowds really start gathering around 8 am, though even at 7:30 the place was already fairly energetic for how early it was. Considering that there were multiple open tables there was a bit of a lag time between check-in and seating, though it was under 10 minutes so I can't really complain. Our very friendly server gave us a quick run-down of the menu, and we got to ordering.
