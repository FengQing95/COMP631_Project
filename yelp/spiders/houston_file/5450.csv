JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has the best ramen in Houston. I have tried 3 different bowls and it just got better every time. My favorite is the spicy chicken ramen with a soft boiled egg. The portions are large enough to be full, but not enough to have left overs. Sometimes it smells weird in there, but I think it's just the kitchen. Plus, you have to sit really close to strangers. All in all a great place.
