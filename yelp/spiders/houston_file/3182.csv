JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Favorite Ramen spot downtown. I've tried almost all the ramen places in Houston and this one is at the top of my list. I secretly wish it wasn't such a popular place because there's almost always a wait, but it speaks to how good the food is! I always get the spicy chicken ramen noodles and steal my gf's tofu from her vegan ramen :) the jinya bun is delectable.
