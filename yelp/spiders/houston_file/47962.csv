Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything I ordered was really delicious! The sweet potato pancakes were bomb. The best part-- they use real Vermont maple syrup! I appreciate when breakfast nooks use real maple syrup and not trash corn syrup. Meanwhile, the service was quick for a busy day. We had a nice and polite server! Going back soon!
