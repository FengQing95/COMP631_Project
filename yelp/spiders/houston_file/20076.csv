Uchi////My boyfriend and I both went for our first time in April and I am SO glad we did. I (regretfully) don't remember our waitress' name, but it was hands down the best service either of us have had before. We decided on the Chef's tasting menu, and it was perfect. Every dish that was brought out was explained perfectly and we were even told how to properly eat them. Our eyes stayed wide the entire time because of how in awe we both were. Houston locals, and definitely big "foodies", we will be returning as often as we can.
