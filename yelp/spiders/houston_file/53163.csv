Kata Robata////When I'm not splurging on Uchi, Kata Robata is always my go to Sushi spot. Haven't had an experience where the fish hasn't been fresh. Some of my go to starter dishes are the jalape√±o hamachi & beef skewers. They never disappoint. On my last visit had the sashimi platter for 2 & it was amazing! Also the pork belly is equally amazing to if you're not trying to go the fish route....that egg with it is just to die for. The only thing here that I haven't been wow'd with would be the cocktails. Very average selection for such a nicely rated/pricey sushi spot. Other than that Kata Robata gets a clear from me!
