The Pit Room////Wasn't horrible but not great. wouldn't go outta my way for this food. I was pretty disappointed when I heard majority of the employees/cooks speaking Spanish. Ps I'm mexican by the way, so no... I'm not racist. Some may not agree with me, but I see it like this.... I would prefer to eat Chinese food cooked by someone of the same ethnic background. I would prefer to eat soul food from a cook of color. Im not saying different ethnicities can't cook outside of their culture. They certainly can. But sorry.... this place and the cooks just didn't do it for me. Place has great reviews so im probably just a one off. Still give it a try and you decide.
