Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Soooo so good and sooo so full. We found this place on yelp as we came from Los Angeles. We came on a Sunday night after a long work day. Food service was really quick and our server Cam was really friendly as well. Made us feel like friends! Get the shorts ribs and the Madeline cornbread. You won't regret it!
