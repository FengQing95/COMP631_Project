Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Today was my first time visiting turns out most bakeries, sweet shops in Houston close early, and Common Bond Bistro don't so we arrived 30 or less minutes before closing even if they were already cleaning and picking up chairs, the staff was super polite and still let us sit down anyway, we didn't stay we just waited for our drink and left.
