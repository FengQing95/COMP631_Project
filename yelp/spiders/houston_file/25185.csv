Uchi////WHAT. In. The. World. After years of hearing all kinds of glowing reviews, I finally had my first Uchi experience last night. Since then, I've thought more than once about my meal, and I honestly am at a loss for words to sufficiently convey how amazing everything was. Everything. Start to finish, including the valet guy.
