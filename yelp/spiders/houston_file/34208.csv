Local Foods////This is my THE most fav. place for lunch. They make fresh sandwiches and salads. Idea is to bring seasonal veggies from farm to table. They have a fresh veggies sandwich and every time I eat it's always been a treat with 4 to 5 diff kinds of veggies. Love their falafel sandwich too. Â
