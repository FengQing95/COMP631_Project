Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We sat outside, and had to get our own drinks, which wasn't an issue, but don't expect table service if you choose the outdoor patio. The hostess and bartender did let us know beforehand about this, which was perfectly fine by us-it was nice out and the lounge was super comfy!
