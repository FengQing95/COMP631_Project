Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our office came here as a group brunch on a Wednesday morning.  The 9 of us arrived at abut 1015 and after a short wait (maybe 5-10 minutes) we were seated at a pair of booths back to back.  So I guess we were together, kinda... basically this place isn't suited for groups more than 6.  But okay, can't hold that against them.  What I can hold against them is that our food didn't arrive until almost an hour later!  It was about 1120 when our food started arriving and closer to 1130 by the time everyone had their food.
