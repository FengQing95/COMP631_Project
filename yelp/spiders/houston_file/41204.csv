Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////we've visited Common Bond twice - once before it was bought out by Johnny Carraba and the second time afterward. this bakery is one of the only places in houston where you could (maybe) close your eyes and pretend that you're actually eating a baguette in france. the bread is authentically made and you can tell that they do not cut corners. the desserts are all beautifully displayed, and deliciously made. Bravo! While the bread and pastries are something to behold, it is cost prohibitive. It's the most delicious bread - but it's expensive. this is the kind of place that is reserved more for a "special treat" than a local bakery where you can stop by on your way home every night and pick up a loaf. but gosh - i do love their bread.
