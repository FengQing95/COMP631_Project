Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Dogs no longer permitted on the patio. What a disappointment! A year ago we came and sat on the patio with our German Shepherd Dog, and the waitstaff was even nice enough to offer a whole jug of iced water for our dog. Shame to cross this place off our list as a dog-friendly brunch joint in Houston.
