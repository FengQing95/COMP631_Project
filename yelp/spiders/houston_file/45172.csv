Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hype! Hype! Hype! I had to stop by to check it out. Parking was super horrible, took us forever to find a parking space. We finally got in and the line was fairly long. I stood in line looking around for a menu. Finally found one once when I got to the glass counter & server asked for my order immediately, which I felt really rush. My total was given and I was blown away by how expensive their food item were.
