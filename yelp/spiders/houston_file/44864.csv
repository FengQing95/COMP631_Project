Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries and desserts are all pretty good, especially the almond croissant! I would say it is the best almond croissant in Houston, but is it worth it to get everytime you want an almond croissant? Probably not. There's usually a line and the price is a bit steep. I really enjoy French Riviera's almond croissant as well, and there's not much of a line and it's priced a bit better.
