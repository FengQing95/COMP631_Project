Uchi////I've thought about going to Uchi for various occasions for 2 years now but have often cancelled the reservation to go to a cliche steakhouse instead. Wow have I been missing out! This is the best restaurant we've ever been to, hands down. Matt was the best server! We had him just keep bringing the house favorites and OMG.. what an experience. If you're hesitating trying this place, don't. Go try Uchi ASAP. It is deserving of all of its hype. Everything was incredible.
