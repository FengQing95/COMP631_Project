The Pit Room////Found this place by chance and was definitely not disappointed. The loaded frito pie was was fantastic, the brisket was perfect and the venison sausage was on point. However my favorite part of the experience besides the food Â was the older man cleaning the tables. He was super friendly and gave us great recommendations. We'd definitely call me back here when in Houston.
