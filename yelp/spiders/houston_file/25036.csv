Uchi////Food was great. Service was shady. I'm not a chronic reviewer of restaurants, but I feel obligated to say something. Our server was Matt with the Mullet (10/28/21). Our party of four had never been here, and when we told our server this, he excitedly offered to start us off by bringing out "a few recommendations". We loved that idea, since it would give us a chance to look over the menu as a group. We didn't see Matt more than once over the next hour or so, while the wait staff proceeded to bring us out a good 10-15 dishes - very expensive ones. We were fine with him bringing out a "few" surprises, but 10-15 does not "a few" make. He never once came back to ask us for our order, and random people just started arriving with random dishes - nonstop. Secondly, the birthday girl of the night let him know she does not eat beef. This was the only guidance we gave him and around 30% of his dish selections had beef in them.
