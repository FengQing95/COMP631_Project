Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////There was a bit of a wait, and the bar was full. I took it as a good sign. The server was to the point and efficient. But the food is where this place shined! I had he corned beef hash with sunny side up eggs and whole wheat toast. Oh and coffee. Pretty sure the jam was made in house and I devoured the rest. Oh and coffee was on point. Only thing is parking lot is tiny, but it really didn't take anything away. Loved it!
