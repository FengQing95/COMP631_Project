Local Foods////Their crunchy chicken is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, for sure!  I was expecting a chicken tender on a pretzel bun, but instead I was treated to a pretzel bun with thickly sliced chicken that had been encrusted in nuts, topped with provolone, tomatoes, lettuce and potato chips (!), drizzled with the perfect amount of buttermilk ranch.  I loved the crunch the potato chips lent the sandwich...fantastic!
