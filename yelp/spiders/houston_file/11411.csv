JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So, you can't make reservations at Jinya. It's first come, first serve. Even on a Wednesday night, it was packed! Unfortunately, not everyone in our party had arrived just yet - and you need everyone in your party to be there in order to be placed on the waiting list. So, that kind of sucked, since there was 6 of us. Now, if there was just 2-4 people in your party, it would be easier, since you could easily just be seated at the bar in front, the smaller tables on each side, or the long table facing the back to order your ramen. When everyone arrived, I would say they had us seated within 5-10 minutes, which was good. The bad thing was we were seated at the middle table, which was a wrap around table that seated other parties. So, there wasn't a sense of privacy with the group we were with. There were booths located on both sides of the restaurant that could seat up to 4 people. Those were better if you had a smaller party.
