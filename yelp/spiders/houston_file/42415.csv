Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////People cut lines and are rude. Food is always delicious and I don't mind the lines but it is really annoying to have one family member or friend get in line and then 5 more join 30 minutes later as if their time is more valuable than yours. It is not a rare occurrence. People feel entitled to do so and do it proudly. The cafe management should find a way to deal with it.
