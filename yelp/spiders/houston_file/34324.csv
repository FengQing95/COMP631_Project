Local Foods////My only gripe-- I was there today and the harvest salad came out with completely unripe, hard, tasteless peaches.  The whole point of a seasonal salad is to eat things at their peak, and these peaches would have been disappointing even in the middle of winter.  But, I still LOVE Local Foods- so 5 stars anyway!
