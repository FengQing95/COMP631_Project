Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////After a long flight from London the day before, and a long night sleep, I woke feeling very empty and I had nothing at home. I wanted to get something for breakfast especially with eggs in it so I went there on a Saturday morning and decided to get the French toast since it was too early for me to have something with meat in it. Little did I know that their French toast is a huge lump of bread that is soaked in syrup and butter, topped with whipped cream, with some few slices of strawberry on top and the bread is dry in the middle. I absolutely hate syrup, butter and whipped cream so the whole thing tasted like SHIT. I couldn't even eat more than two bites before walking away. Is this how French toast should look or taste? I have had it before and my wife makes it at home and it taste much better and not usually soaked in anything like syrup or butter ..YUCK!! I should have gotten Huevos Rancheros somewhere else.
