JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Chau - Thanks for your review. It has never been our intention to "hype" our restaurant. We are simply trying to bring something new and enjoyable to Houston since up until last year, there were not so many dedicated ramen shops in this city. That said, we're never going to be all things to all people, but we do our best and a large swath of Houston seems to enjoy what we have on offer. We thank you for your patronage.
