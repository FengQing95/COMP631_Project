JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Guys. This is my favorite ramen spot in Houston so far. All the choices are good but my favorite has been the Tonkotsu black with thick noodles and a side of corn. Honestly, when I eat a soupy noodle dish I never drink the broth. But I find myself tipping the bowl to get every last drop every time I order this dish. It is seriously SO good. It's rich but not too heavy. So comforting on a cold day. The pork chashu is always seasoned so well and never too fatty for me. Cant forget that perfect soft boiled egg either! The service here never disappoints. I always get my ramen pretty quickly. There's almost always a wait but it's worth it to me.
