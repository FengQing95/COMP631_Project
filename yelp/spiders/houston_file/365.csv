JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Augstinus - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen; our tapas dishes, obviously, aren't the main draw, but our headquarters is constantly devising new items, and we rotate in/out items according to demand. Nevertheless, thanks for the review, and we hope to serve you again soon.
