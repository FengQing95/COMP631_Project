It was solidly mushy with no other flavors besides egg. I think it would be better with a little bit of sour or sweet or spice. It was also too mushy. I think adding a bit more of a crunch to the sandwich would break it up a bit more. However, I did really enjoy their refreshing cabbage slaw. It was savory and a bit sour. Super delicious. Â
