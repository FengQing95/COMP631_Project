Uchi////Jeremy Parzen discussed his take on Uchi's wine list yesterday and so I will take a moment to extol the virtues of Uchi's Sake' list. There are solid choices across most price ranges and on our particular evening we chose the Otokoyama Tokubetsu Junmai - in 720ml bottle. This sake' was described on the menu as having the flavor of clean winter air. While the whimsy of this description was not lost on me, the sake' itself was vibrant on the palate, clean across the aromas, and finished with a long, perpetual grip that carried the flavors of the fish and kept my fingers reaching for glass after glass.
