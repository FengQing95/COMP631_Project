Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have had coffee and pastries here. I do not come back for the coffee, but I absolutely come back for the pastries. I got a vanilla latte, which was good not great. However, I love their baked goods. I haven't tried all of them (is this even possible?), but the ones I've tried I have loved. The oatmeal cream pies are a particular favorite of mine, but the Nutella croissant is good too. Common Bond also serves a cooked breakfast, but I have never had it.
