The Pit Room////Haven't tried a lot of BBQ joints in Houston but this does have a place in the top 3. The beef rib was so good - perfect amount of fat, very moist (even the leftovers were still good *drools*) I kept saying "mmmmm" with each bite haha pretty sure my bf was annoyed. The pork sausage with jalapeno cheese was delicious, I prefered it over the beef sausage. The brisket was ok but still better than average. We also got the mac n cheese and potato salad, both were good. It definitely hit our BBQ craving! I was disappointed that they ran out of the ice scream sandwiches. I really wanted to try the brown sugar butter cookie - I will come back for it!
