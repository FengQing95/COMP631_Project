Baby Barnaby's////My go to order - Green Eggs ($10.95). Comes with 2 eggs scrambled with spinach and artichoke hearts with jack cheese. You also get chicken apple sausage, potatoes, and toast (but I ask for biscuit instead). You can't go wrong with ordering this. The eggs are so creamy and you can't even tell you're eating veggies with it.
