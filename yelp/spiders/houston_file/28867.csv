The Pit Room////Ummmmm im so confused, maybe its because i had such high hopes for this place. The BBQ is just okay, i mean if you ever had a uncle, cousin, dad, brother get on the BBQ pit then this no comparison. When i pulled up I knew when i didnt see a smoke stack i should have known. I got the 3 meat plate with venison sausage, ribs and brisket. The sausage was good but everything else was just okay. I didnt go crazy for it. The bbq sauce was really good, a little spicy but i liked that. The mac and cheese was watery and the potato salad was alright. Overall, good but not great. I probably will just get my friend, uncle or someone to fire up the pit and save some money next time.
