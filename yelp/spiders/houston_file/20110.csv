Uchi////But let's real talk.  I still have really violent flashbacks of when this was Felix's.  When I walked up to it, I remembered when I stuck a chip into queso... and the queso was so hard it broke the chip and almost my nail (maybe not).  I really just hate this building.  I am actually quite impressed with what they did with the inside because i don't think they can alter the outside since it appears to be some sort of historic landmark?
