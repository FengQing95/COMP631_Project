The Pit Room////Enough good things said by others so I don't want to repeat. I have two suggestions to show why I did not give it 5 stars. I went there for the brisket, which seems to have its fat mostly cut off. This seems common for BBQ places in a more urban setting. For "health" reasons? Â But this greatly reduces the draw of BBQ brisket. I think a BBQ place should serve brisket unapologetically with all the fat. People who come here should understand that they are not here for white meat chicken breast. Serve brisket the way Nature is intended. My best BBQ so far is a place outside Austin that the brisket is moist and juicy (=fatty).
