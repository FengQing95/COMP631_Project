JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I entered and chose my seat since it was off hours.  My female server was wonderful**at first and did her best to explain a couple confusing points on their menu and specialty menu.  I got the black tonkotsu ramen with garlic oil, garlic chips and a side of one fresh garlic bulb and a garlic press.  It also came with two pieces of tender but uncharred pork, thin noodles, green onions and crispy onions.  I also received a whole marinated egg which was a bit over cooked to my liking but not hard boiled.  Thank goodness because I dislike totally hard boiled eggs in my ramen.  The noodles were thin but had a good strength to them and did not get soft.  Btw some ramen entrees come with thicker noodles.
