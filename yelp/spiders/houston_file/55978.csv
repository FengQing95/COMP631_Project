Kata Robata////We recently visited for the first time on our anniversary. It was Saturday night around 7pm and we were seated within 5minutes of arriving. The server was very nice and quickly took our drink and food orders. The first of the food was out very quick within 5-7 minutes. We had a salad, chirashi sashimi and the Longhorn roll. We also ended up ordering the bone marrow and finished with Halo Halo for the dessert. Everything was delicious and we certainly will be back! I recommend eating your sushi first and finishing with the bone marrow!
