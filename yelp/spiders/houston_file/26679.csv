The Pit Room////I eat bbq all over the country and this place has some good bbq.  While I wasn't in love with the sauce and would like to see another option the brisket didn't need sauce.   It is that good.  I like brisket on fries or smoked bakers I had to invent my own from the menu.   I recommend the queso and chips and a chopped brisket sandwich.   spread the meat over the chips and spread that yummy queso.
