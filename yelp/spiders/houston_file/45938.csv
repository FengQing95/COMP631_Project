Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Be ready to find parking! Â This place is crowded on the weekends for their brunch menu. I have been here twice and I am a big fan of the display, freshness and hospitality. The crowd just makes me cringe. I came alone to have some brunch. The Sausage and Egg Sandwich was delicious and nontraditional in the sense that it is not just scrambled eggs and sausage wedged between bread. There were vegetables on it, a nice running yolk with hollandaise sauce - imagine egg benefit. The sausage was large, fresh, soft and definitely no signs of it being a frozen patty. I would definitely choose this again. I was alone, so I wish I had friendlies to try other items on the menu. The cappuccino was nice, not sweet as it is supposed to be.
