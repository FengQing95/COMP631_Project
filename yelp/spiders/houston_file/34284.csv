Local Foods////I'm confused with Local Foods a bit. It's vegan friendly, but clearly offers meat, but somehow only nasty flax milk for coffee? Everyone was nice, but when I attempted to submit an online order on their crappy website I got an internal server error. Every time I attempted to check out, I was prompted to add a special LF tote bag, but then I would get an error that it didn't exist. When I asked the cashier about the tote, he was clueless. I ordered a lot of food but it was all crammed in a small bag with no handles. Haven't tried the food yet, but the coffee was shit and the flow of the restaurant was not intuitive and the experience lackluster. I see what you're trying to be Local Foods, but you're not quite there yet. You seem to take pride in your ingredients, but the details need to be figured out still-especially your dairy situation.
