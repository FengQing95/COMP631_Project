Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Amazing! From the vibe, look and smells to the actually eating experience. The line is long but worth the wait. We had an original croissant and an almond croissant which were both very large and unbelievable good. We had lattes which were also great. There are so many more options to keep trying.
