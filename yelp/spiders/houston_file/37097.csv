Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Heard about this on a podcast called Welcome to Houston. Place is really great. Delicious food, fast and attentive servers/bartenders, and don't get me started on the whiskey room. Shouts to Tim for being a dope bartender. He recommended the pulled pork sandwich to me. Will definitely be going back.
