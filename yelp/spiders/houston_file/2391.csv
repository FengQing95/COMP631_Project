JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So really about the only thing disappointing was the ground pork that didn't taste very fresh outside of that everything else was stellar, executed to perfection. Â Service was also outstanding, quick, attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable -- left a very nice tip in reciprocation.
