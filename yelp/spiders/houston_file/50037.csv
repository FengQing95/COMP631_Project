Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////That being said, I'll just put the disclaimer that my meal cost me about $17 (no drink), and I had to wait from about 10am - 11:15am on Sunday morning to get it. I had free coffee while I waited and sat in the shade on an overturned plastic crate. Take from that what you will.
