Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The Drunken Dirty Chai was my choice for morning kickstarter, and it was a good one at that! Snooze actually boasts multiple warm, creative coffee options. And in general, if options are what you want then that's what you get at this place. The food menu is rather large and varied...I went with Juan's breakfast tacos, and the waitress was nice enough to humor my annoying requests so I was able to have egg whites and to add soyrizo. I struggled a bit with the sweet vs. savory dilemma, so they also allowed me to add one mini pancake, flavor of my choosing! I decided on the sweet potato one, and the waitress actually offered me the gluten free option which she said is actually better than the regular batter. While I don't exactly buy into the gluten-free thing (unless you have celiac disease), I was sold when I heard that the gluten-free variety gets extra sweet potato mashed directly in. So after all that menu-massaging, I ended up with a pretty perfect breakfast. The tacos and soyrizo were delish, and the little pancake absolutely satisfied my sweet tooth. And the whole experience was quick, quick, quick! I suppose it had to be, with all of the hungry breakfast patrons lining up at the door.
