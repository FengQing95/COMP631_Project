The Pit Room////Out of the BBQ places I've tried in Texas, The Pit Room reigns supreme. The brisket was tender and full of quality meat, no fat, just the way I like it. The most popular is the jalapeño pork sausage and it was the best pork sausage stuffed with chunks of jalapeño and cheese. There is a serving station to grab however much pickled vegetables you prefer: onion, carrots, peppers. The coffee bourbon sauce was really interesting. I actually prefer that over the BBQ sauce.
