Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Thankfully, I saved room for the pastries as well. The hazelnut croissant brioche was a clear favorite. Perfectly charming, this decadent gem of soft bread and oozing hazelnut chocolate stayed on my mind until I got another one. The fruit croissant was also fantastic, and I liked that the powdered sugar and fruit jelly wasn't overbearing or detracting from the perfect bread. I plan to go back for macarons, as they all looked great as well.
