Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ordered the bourbon chicken flatbread - it was superb.  Great flavor - some unique spices to it, so it was a deeper flavor than just Jack Daniels barbecue sauce on a piece of chicken.  Heavy use of heirloom tomatoes.  Stellar choice (recommended by the bartender, of course).
