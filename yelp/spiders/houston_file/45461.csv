Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is absolutely delicious! I went there on a Thursday morning and service was super quick. I would definitely go here for brunch again. I got the sausage egg sandwich and it was more than enough food. My friend got the French toast and ate it Â up! It is slightly pricy in my opinion, but you pay for grate food.
