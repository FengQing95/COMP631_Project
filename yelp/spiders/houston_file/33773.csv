Local Foods////Had a great Beef Sandwich here....friendly staff and helpful....made me try the vegan queso, I was amazed.  Friends salad and sandwich was also fresh and looked very good.  The restaurant is very clean and tidy and well laid out.  This is more of what the neighborhood really needs......less bars, more of this.
