Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Loved this place! Came here for a birthday dinner with a group of about 10 people. I LOVE the vibe that I get from the decor and layout as soon as I walk in. It is perfect for a cute date night or even a girls night out! As far as the food goes, I ordered the Cajun Brick Chicken and sweet potato mac and cheese. The chicken was pretty good but I don't know if I was a huge fan of the sweet potato version of macaroni and cheese. I would've loved it so much more without the sweet potato flavoring. However, everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their food and I can NOT wait to try their brunch! The menu for brunch looks amazing.
