Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The service was impeccable. Our waiter, Jeremy was spot on and offered complete explanations of our inquires. He steered my drink choices towards two great cocktails. First; I tried the Bosscat, followed by the ah ah ah dang I can't remember the name but the two were delicious. Staring at 300 bottles of whiskey on the wall make for a difficult decision. I went with his suggestions and was not disappointed.
