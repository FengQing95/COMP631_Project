Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The valrhona mocha is excellent! Ask for it extra hot if desired as a wide mouth cup does lose temp fairly quickly. The scone was perfect. With some jam and butter, goes very well with a coffee. The ambiance is very relaxing with natural light flooding the cafe, inspiring in some ways.
