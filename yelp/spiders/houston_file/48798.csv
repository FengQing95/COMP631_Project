Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came as a trio around 7:30am on a Saturday, and there was probably a 5 minute wait. There's basically no parking except street parking around the corner. The place is kind of like a futuristic diner but with a lot more lighting which I really liked. Everyone was cheery even in the early AM, and even though we were seated in the very bad of the restaurant, our waitress checked on us regularly which I really appreciated.
