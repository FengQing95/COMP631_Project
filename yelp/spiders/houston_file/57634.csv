Kata Robata////The seaweed salad with sesame vinaigrette was my favorite dish. I've had most of the seaweeds on the plate before, but the addition of the sesame vinaigrette elevated the experience. The vinaigrette was sweet, creamy and a little nutty. I was looking forward to trying the miso eggplant with grilled sushi rice but found the flavor of the eggplant to be not much different than other places. The dish tastes just like it's described. I did like the grilled sushi rice as the vinegar addition is different from regular grilled rice balls. It doesn't taste that great as leftovers though. We asked them to split the lobster and crab ramen, and I thought it was a good amount of lobster, noodles and broth in my portion. Since the regular bowl is $24, a half portion at $12 with a small amount of noodles, rich broth and tender lobster meat was okay to me. The strawberry coconut tres leches was pretty and yummy. It was soaked with the sauce and had fluffy whipped cream. The spicy chopped scallop nigiri looked pretty good and tasted okay. It didn't taste as good as other places though. The rising sun roll was okay. The truffle oil smell is prominent. The lobster sando was a disappointment. It's the size of a thick slice of milk bread that's been quartered. They split open the quarter piece and added a bit of lobster and cream sauce. The most prominent flavor was the butter that coated the toast. The best item on the plate was the Asian pigeonwing decoration. The seaweed salad, ramen and desserts are worth trying. Any rice dishes are best experienced somewhere else as they're okay but not as delicious as the other items on the menu.
