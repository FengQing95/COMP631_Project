Baby Barnaby's////Saturday brunch and Baby Barnaby's was our destination. We waited about 20 minutes which was no big deal. The service was very good and prompt. The seating is cramped, but that is part of the ambiance. The food is satisfactory. The fried breakfast potatoes are fabulous! I loved them. The eggs were eggs. The bacon was rubbery. I love bacon and I couldn't even eat a whole piece. My husband and I shared a waffle. It had a strange flavor. Our friends also had a waffle as well, and they agreed that it was generally weird and not a great waffle. One of our friends had the green eggs and said they were delicious! The biscuits were also very good. So, we had both good and so-so in our meal. Â
