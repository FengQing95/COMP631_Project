JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Since we opened our doors in early 2015, we have never asked ANYONE sitting at the bar to move to accommodate guests who are ordering food. Our host staff only directs guests to open seats at the bar if they do not feel like waiting for a table in the dining room. Moreover, I have never heard of any of our guests who were seated at the bar with -- or without -- drinks being asked to move by other guests. If it has ever happened, I can only imagine that our guests were able to discuss and/or resolve the issue on their own.
