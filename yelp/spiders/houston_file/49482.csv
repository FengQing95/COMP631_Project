Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Think there pancakes are their specially.  Had the kinds: pineapple, blueberry sweet potato.  All excellent with special touches.  They were on the not warm end, but we still enjoyed them. Also had eggs benedict (they have several) with avocado which came with hash browns , pretty bland, and huevo rancero eggs, small, ok.  Meh. Pricing doable. Lots of choices. Food took some time to come out. Saw lots of folks with alc drinks. (We were joking that they plan to have people have time for at least one drink before food arrives.
