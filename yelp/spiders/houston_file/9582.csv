JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In terms of the noodles, we do serve them al dente (ie. with a "bite) since they will continue to cook in the broth once they are pulled from the boilers. Noodle density can also be made to order as "soft" or "hard." In some cases I have prepared a ramen bowl three times in order to satisfy a customer's preference for noodle density.
