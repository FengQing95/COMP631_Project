Kata Robata////had a great meal here while visiting Houston. I would like to single out the spicy soy ramen for five stars. I've had ramen at several of the most hyped ramen joints in NY, but this one is one of the best bowls I've had in the US. nutty, fragrant, not too salty creamy broth. chewy noodles, egg done right with gooey center.
