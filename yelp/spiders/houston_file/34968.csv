Local Foods////Price/food: 4/5 I bit pricier for a sandwich than I would have preferred but I think the food is pretty good. They have a variety of sandwiches (ranging from a smoked salmon bagel sandwich to a pork banh mi) that comes with 2 sides or a cup of soup, salads, or appetizers. I got the truffled egg sandwich with a side of kale and house made chips (total was ~$11)
