JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My taste buds are really picky especially when it comes to anything with pork or any meat for that matter. But honestly this is the best place to go for Ramen in Houston. Plus I didn't like the blow I originally picked and they let me get another one with chicken broth that was delicious! Great atmosphere and service! Definitely my "Go-To" ramen place.
