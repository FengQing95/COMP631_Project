Baby Barnaby's////Now for the food. I got the Green Eggs. Sorry, but there aren't any green hams. This plate consists of two scrambled eggs mixed with pepper jack cheese, spinach, and artichoke hearts. It also comes with toast and cajun styled potatoes. This is my most favorite dish and is without a doubt, a must have. My second favorite is the Lox Platter. This has a bagel with cream cheese, of which you spread to your liking, and it is accompanied with smoked salmon, tomatoes, red onions, and capers. It is also just as tasty. :) These plates are about $8 and $9, respectively.
