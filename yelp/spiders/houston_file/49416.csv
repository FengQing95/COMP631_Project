Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////However, the only reason I give it 3 stars is because the service wasn't that great. Our waiter which I can't remember his name literally took our order and didn't come back to check on us until we were pretty much finished our meal. He didn't bring our food out or even check back to make sure everything was accurate. The two times that we did see the waiter he gave us some excuse as to why he was gone for so long; something about being caught up in a convo with another table or some crap.
