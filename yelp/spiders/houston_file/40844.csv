Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I made reservations (highly recommended as this place does get busy and is packed! Especially for brunch). Though I made reservations for the lunch/dinner service during a week day and it was not that busy at the time my girlfriends and I stopped by, but it did steadily get busier as time went on. Â When we were seated, our waiter was polite and friendly and made some great recommendations on drinks. I prefer a more sweet cocktail without much of the taste of alcohol; the alcohol that creeps on you. Anyway, I ordered for appetizers the pork belly poutine, mac and cheese, fried broccolini, spicy chicken + cheese dip, and whiskey okra (this was of course shared amongst my girlfriends and I). The pork belly poutine was okay. The pork belly was deliciously flavorful and tender, but the steak fries were what turned me off some to the entirety of the dish. It was still good, but it wasn't my favorite app. The whiskey okra and the fried broccolini were pretty good. The flavoring/sauce drenched over the vegetables were good and made the plain tasting vegetables pop in flavor. My favorite app though, would have had to been the spicy chicken + cheese dip. It reminded me of a buffalo chicken cheese dip, but better. It was so warm and gooey, and the homemade potato chips went perfectly with each bite. This app is probably now my go-to whenever I visit this place again.
