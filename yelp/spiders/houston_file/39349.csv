Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So like always the atmosphere was great and drinks awesome. We had the beef ribs with green beans, fried onions and scallop potatoes. The beef was so tender and delicious and the fried onions complemented the beef and the green beans well. The green beans tasted like green goodness and we could tell the meal was fresh and made with love. Â Lunch and dinner menu is my fav. The avocado toast with shrimp appetizer was delicious and I couldn't wait to eat more. The management and wait staff was awesome and attentive.
