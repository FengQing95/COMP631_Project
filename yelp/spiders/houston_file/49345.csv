Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't know, Leslie, I just don't know. I love breakfast food so I've been wanting to come here since I heard they were opening. However, comments about waits scared me away. Then, I had a friend visiting from out of town and the only time we could meet up was for breakfast. Conveniently, they were one of the few options near her hotel and was open by 6:30. When we walked in the doors right around 6:30, there were only a few cars in the parking lot and less than five tables taken.
