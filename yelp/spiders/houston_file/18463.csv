Uchi////Food (Dinner): We went with a group in which we ordered family style.  I went in not wanting to like this place because everyone keep on telling how great it is.  It certainly exceeded all my expectations and it is now my favorite Japanese restaurants.  The combination of flavors for each dish was just fantastic.
