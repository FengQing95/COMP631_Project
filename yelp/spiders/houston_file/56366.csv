Kata Robata////We have tried only a few Japanese places in town, but this could be one of the best Japanese restaurants in Houston. Quality of food and service was excellent. We initially thought it was slightly pricier than it should be, but Sushi Platter was almost 1.5 servings. Toppings were fresh and we were pleasantly surprised when they offered to fry and serve a sweet shrimp head from the platter - very tasty.
