Uchi////A tasting menu happy hour? Yes, please! The happy hour menu offers a limited selection of some of Uchi's best dishes. Pricing is reasonable and the dishes are great for sharing. My happy hour crew often orders several things for the table, tapas style. Service is always excellent and the vibe is vibin', as they say (They being young folks who know how to appropriately use the word "vibin'").
