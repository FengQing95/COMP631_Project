The Pit Room////Good food. My friends and I all bought one meat and shared a bit among four of us. The turkey and the jalape√±o cheddar sausage were my favorites. They also had iced coffee by their fountain drinks, never seen that before but I gladly took one to go. The only thing I did not like is that there were flies everywhere, not enough to ruin my meal but enough to notice. I'd recommend coming here, just sit away from the doors to avoid the flies.
