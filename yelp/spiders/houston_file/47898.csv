Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food is great, nice atmosphere, staff is nice. It was packed and had an hour wait but we sat outside and got served in about 10-15 minutes. They even gave us a free pancak not for the wait, but a misorder.,I'm full, try the sweet potato pancakes man they are good. Will definitely be back again. Justin is the bomb waiter ask for him.
