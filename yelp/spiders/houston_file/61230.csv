Baby Barnaby's////Service here is ultra-speedy, with no pleasantries, multiple times my server didn't even stop walking when asking me questions. It seemed to me they were just trying to rush people through and turn tables. So while I think they put together a fine breakfast, it's not a place to linger and enjoy time with friends.
