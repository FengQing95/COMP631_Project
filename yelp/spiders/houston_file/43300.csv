Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love this corner bakery. With a totally French persuasion, you can't go wrong with the classics. I landed here on a Tuesday in search of French onion soup. Along the way, I discovered this place has an amazing display of baked confections and beautiful fondant-iced cakes. I bypassed the sweets as I was in a savory, body-conscious mood, so I opted for caramelized Brussels sprouts (really) to accompany my soup. They were both delicious. I returned with a friend a few weeks later and got the Caesar salad, which was equally yummy with house-made dressing and anchovy slivers. There's a coffee bar and wine so this corner spot suits me just fine.
