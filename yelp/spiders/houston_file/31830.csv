Local Foods////I love Local but today they got on my nerves like no other! NEVER AGAIN will I order to go from there. It's a major rip off to order their salad to go. Their salads are so small in the to go container - omg it looks like a side salad. But the part that really pains me is that I specifically asked for fried wontons on the side and guess what I got home - wontons all over the freaking salad.
