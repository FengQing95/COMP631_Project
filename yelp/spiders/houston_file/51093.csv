Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great new breakfast spot in Montrose! I've come here twice now and I would definitely recommend it for breakfast/brunch. Came here opening weekend and the line was out the door. At 12pm on a Sunday we were told it would be a 1.5-2 hour wait and we waited an hour and 40 minutes before we were seated. Luckily they take down your cell phone number and text you when your table is available so feel free to walk around, grab a drink at their bar, or play one of their outdoor games while you're waiting. The only reason I agreed to wait that long (I HATE waiting) is because I live in the neighborhood so I went home to wait and just sped over there once they texted me- otherwise, I don't think this place is worth a 2 hour wait. The other time I came here was on a weekday at 11am and I only waited 20 minutes for a table.
