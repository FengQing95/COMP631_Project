Local Foods////Second, the food is terrific. I ordered the truffle egg salad sandwich on the pretzel bun - and WOW. The pretzel bun is delicious and the egg salad doesn't disappoint. You get two sides with the sandwich, so I ordered the Four Beans and the Cous Cous. The Four Beans has a hint of curry and cilantro, and it's very satisfying. The Cous Cous has very good flavor, but I'd probably opt for something different next time (just a preference thing I guess). We didn't order any desserts, but they looked terrific too - carrot cake cupcakes, chocolate cupcakes, brownies, and popsicles.
