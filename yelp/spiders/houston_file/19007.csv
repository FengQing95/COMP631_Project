Uchi////My husband and I are finally DINK's. That's right - Dual Income, NO KIDS. After four years of graduate school, husband landed himself a job! We've been savoring this moment for two years - that day when husband would land a job, and we could go out and celebrate at the most expensive restaurant we could think of. As classy Montrosians (I made it up, ok), we of course settled on Uchi. We walked into the Industrial/Modern-decorated Japanese restaurant and I swear I felt like I'd arrived.
