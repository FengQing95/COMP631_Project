Local Foods////I am really not sure what this place is on about. I mean, all the servers were dressed rather hipster-ish and judging from the majority of the observed clientele (hipsters and college students) makes me wonder if like Starbucks, they are all afraid of not being hipster and cool if they actually admit the food is here is just, dare I say it, OK to borderline rubbish.
