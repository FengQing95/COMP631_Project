Local Foods////Local foods is the best! I wouldn't call myself a big sandwich person because I feel like there's usually too much bread, but local foods is my exception. I absolutely love all the unique options it offers. I guess being a sandwich place allows a restaurant to dip into a lot of different cuisines while still remaining cohesive amongst the umbrella theme of sandwich. Every item listed on the menu looks mouth watering! What's also awesome is that each sandwich comes with two sides so local foods ends up loading your tray up with food, even though a little pricey.
