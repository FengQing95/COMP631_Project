Uchi////Walu Walu - Grilled escolar with a beautiful sweet ginger-soy glaze poured over top. The fish itself has a very distinct taste that is accentuated by the citrus. Funny note: humans can't digest the wax coat of escolar properly, and it can act as a laxative in large quantities. So as tempting as it may be, don't order more than a few of these!
