Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////During my previous encounter, one of the managers asked about my experience and I explained in detail my issues with the execution of the meal. She seemed very surprised to hear that the poached eggs were cold and that the pancakes were not to my liking. She cancelled the bill and generously offered me a $25 gift card. I mentioned that one of my friends was having a birthday this weekend. She assured me that she would have a table ready for us today. She personally checked us in and showed us to our table. The food was so much better! No cold eggs this time! My friend go the eggs Benedict combo and she really liked them. I got the corned beef hash which was extra crispy just how I like them. Another friend ordered the egg frittata and seemed to enjoy hers as well. The Pancake of the day had white and dark chocolate chip and was delicious! The grapefruit mimosas and the prickly pear Margarita we're yummy too. I'm glad I gave them another chance. The customer service here is phenomenal!
