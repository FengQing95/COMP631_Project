The Pit Room////I really enjoyed my experience here! Trying BBQ was high on my list of things to try when I was in Houston because I've always heard it's some of the best, this place did not disappoint! My friend and I shared a 3 meat platter with two sides. All of the meat we got had great flavor. For sides we got mac&cheese and coleslaw. I loved the mac&cheese, the coleslaw was good but nothing special.
