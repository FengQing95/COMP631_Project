Uchi////I was afraid that I was going to go home still hungry from Uchi when I went there when the 1st dish was served - the portion was pretty small for the price. However, I ended up pretty full by the end of the dinner, which is suprising considering we only ordered 5 dishes to be shared 3 ways: hamachi nabe, karaage, bacon tataki, pitchfork roll, and ham and eggs roll - plus 4 nigiri for each of us (I got Â and 1 shared dessert. The waiter was very knowledgable with all the items on the menu, to the point where he'd arrange the order of what dish would be served to avoid any taste clashes. All the dishes were very good and tasty, with bacon tataki as the highlight for me. I ordered the sake toro, boquerones, madai, and foie gras nigiri for myself, with foie gras nigiri as my best choice.
