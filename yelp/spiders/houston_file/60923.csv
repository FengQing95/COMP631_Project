Baby Barnaby's////My first time here and it did not disappoint! The service was great  and the food was fantastic. I am not a big fan of scrabbled eggs but the green eggs here made me reconsider. They were softly scrambled with gooey cheese and spinach  and artichoke. My husband ordered the steak and eggs, also delicious. My favorite part is the freshly squeezed Oj. It was the perfect blend of tang and sweetness. Can't wait to return!
