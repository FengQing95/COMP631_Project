Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I couldn't figure out the ordering process. Didn't even know they had savory food until I came on to write this review. In fact, I didn't know what to do upon entering the place - I just stood in the bakery line behind other people. I suppose if you just wanted to order coffee you could just walk up to the coffee bar. I SUPPOSE. I just awkwardly went with the flow and asked the cashier about the coffee ordering process (which can be done upon paying for your sweet items).
