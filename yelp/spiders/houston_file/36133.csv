Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I planned an engagement brunch for my cousin and her fiance at Bosscat. It was a party of 16 and I must say that the service was awesome and the food was great! Everyone in our party were pleased and had a great time. Definitely a must try when you don't care about calories. Â I recommend Bosscat and I will go back again. Try the Fruity Pebbles French Toast and the Sticky Bum Breakfast Burger.
