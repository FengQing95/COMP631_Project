Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've visited twice, both times for dinner. My first visit was pretty recently after they opened.  We were taken on a thorough tour of the whiskey room, which i really enjoyed! The waitress was very knowledgeable of the different types of whiskeys and made great recommendations.  We ended up trying both flights of whiskey and were not disappointed.
