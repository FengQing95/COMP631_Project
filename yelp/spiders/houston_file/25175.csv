Uchi////Outstanding food in the most special of places to celebrate anything or nothing at all. Very casual atmosphere (I wore athletic clothes) but food really is off the charts. I was especially impressed by the vegetarian menu that was fairly large and very interesting. I also loved the fish and other items on the main menu. Highly recommend.
