The Pit Room////Walk outside and post up on the wood bar facing the street. Dig into my rib and I'm instantly transmitted to my happy place. I devour the entire thing in record time. Then focus is turned to the sides. I overheard someone raving about okra while waiting in line and it looked good enough. Well let me tell you it tasted even better than it looked! Also the potato salad was exactly my style with the large pieces of egg white mixed in.
