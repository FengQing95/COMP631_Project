JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kristin - Thank you for the great review and the especially kind words. You are correct that we have revamped our menu in recent months. Our corporate headquarters introduced new tapas and ramen bowls. There's an old saying in the restaurant industry that if you never make adjustments in almost every area of your business, you'll never grow or improve. That said, we still offer many of the dishes that no longer appear on the menu. Just ask your server and they can help you find these "off-menu" items. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
