JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Be prepared to wait a while to sit. It was crazy the night we went and we had to wait for a bit but they had heaters outside so that was nice. I had fried chicken thighs and the bun, both were delicious. I also tried the chicken ramen and really enjoyed it, I added all the sauces they offer on the table. My husband had the pork broth ramen special, which he enjoyed but it was a little greasy. I really enjoyed this place and will be back!
