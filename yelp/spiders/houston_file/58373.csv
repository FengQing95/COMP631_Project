Baby Barnaby's////Wait is long for weekend brunch.  Self serve coffee available as you wait.  Awesome!  Very friendly service.  They leave a thermos of coffee and jug of water at the table so you can refill your stuff whenever.  Huevos rancheros was good.  Generous pile of fresh juicy mix of berries on the waffles.
