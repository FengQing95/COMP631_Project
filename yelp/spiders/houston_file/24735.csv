Uchi////I would be remiss if I didn't say a word about the service at Uchi, which was excellent. Coordinating with a planner to reserve a table for 10 was quite easy, and our servers were very attentive and helpful. During happy hour, items are definitely a little slow to come out, though, so order early rather than adding items as you go.
