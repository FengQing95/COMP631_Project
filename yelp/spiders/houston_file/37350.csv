Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm a northerner so I was very skeptical when they had the Kentucky Hot Brown but I decided to order it and boy did I not regret it. It was amazing! You can definitely tell this place uses only fresh ingredients. My wife had the grilled cheese and soup which I ate half of :) Those two main dishes were all 5 stars in my book. The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the Moscow Mule had too much ginger beer in it but it was served in a Cooper mug which I love. Â And the flat bread pizza appetizer was alright. Would I come back? Absolutely!!! The decor is cool and our server was awesome. I'm looking forward to coming back since it's so close to my office.
