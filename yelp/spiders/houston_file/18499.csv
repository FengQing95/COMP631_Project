Uchi////Hot Items: They have a good twist on some sweet + tangy fried chicken, but I wouldn't have ordered it at a pricey place like this; I'd just go to H-Mart and get that twice fried fried chicken in the pizza boxes =) Â However, they did have this searing pot of rice, yellowtail, onion flakes, and an egg where they pour a sauce and cook it at the table which was a pretty good take on a Japanese version of BiBimBap, very tasty.
