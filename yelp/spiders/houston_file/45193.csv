Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bakery: we also got a chocolate chip cookie and a brioche which is a hazelnut filled bread ball covered in chocolate, and let me tell you, it was delicious!!! They only have the brioche on the weekends, but I would definitely go back again and wait in line for it. I also got a chocolate croissant, which I feel is worth the price because it's so ginormous!
