Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The almond croissant was perfect. It was light, airy, and had semisweet filling in its' center. I didn't care too much for the chocolate brioche but would definitely return for the almond croissant and strawberry cream puff. The cafe also offered a wide selection of caffeinated drinks, macarons, as well as a savory menu.
