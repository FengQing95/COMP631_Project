Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've finally made it to COMMON BOND! This place has exceeded my expectations. From the welcoming staff, to the beautiful atmosphere and of course he cuisine. Today I had the wings. Possibly the best wings I've had here in Houston. I asked the barista for a iced green tea and I handed him $5 and he told me not to worry about it. The little things like that is what makes people returning customers. As far as the baked goods, I think I just ate the best cookie of my life. Common bond bakery, I WILL BE BACK. Thank you for the amazing breakfast!
