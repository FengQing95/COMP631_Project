Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Chicken torta: THE BREAD WAS SO DELICIOUS! The chicken was not very well seasoned but the toppings (crema, guac, jalapenos) made the sandwich yummy. The two pieces of iceberg(?) lettuce on the sandwich were very sad. I just couldn't get over the telera bread they used, I would eat that by itself haha.
