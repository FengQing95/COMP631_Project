Local Foods////i ended up getting the crunchy chicken sandwich. i liked how the crunchiness is from crushed nuts and not an unhealthy breaded/fried crust. the pretzel bun was also delicious. i think the sandwich would have been much better if it came toasted though, but i'm sure you can ask for it made that way. i chose the quinoa and kale as my two sides. the quinoa was good but a little sour for my taste, and the kale was delicious! i was thinking it probably wouldn't be that good but i needed some leafy greens. its perfect balance of flavors and pearls of sweet golden raisins took me by surprise.
