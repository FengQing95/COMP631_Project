Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kugelhopf is a traditional bakery item in Central Europe and resembles marble cake, in an adorably small bundt-like form. The Kugelhopf was dusted with sugar, and it definitely caught my eye. It also consists of almonds and raisins, and I don't particularly like raisins . I think that if I liked raisins, I wouldn't have had much of a problem with it, because it was small and light, but the bits of raisins I'd find throughout the pastry didn't sit well with me. While it wasn't my favorite treat, I'm still glad I tried it and now know what it is.
