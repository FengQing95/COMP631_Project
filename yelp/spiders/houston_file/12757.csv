JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Before trying Jinya, I thought Tiger Den was my favorite spot to get ramen. I came here on a Thursday during late lunch time, and it was pretty dead. Immediately got seated. I feel like they could've done better with designing the layout, because I can totally see how it would get annoying during rush hours. Aside from that, the ramen was d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s. I normally get spicy miso ramen because the prior times of trying regular tonkatsu ramen at other places, I thought it was very bland. However, the tonkatsu black at Jinya was made to perfection. The noodles were thin, and the soup was creamy - but not too overly creamy. The pork belly was so tender and juicy.
