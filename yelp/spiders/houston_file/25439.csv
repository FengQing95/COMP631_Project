Uchi////*1/26/12 UPDATE* - so we went back for a second time this week and with the wonderful Pam as our waitress, everything went perfectly the second time around.  Food came out well-paced and our dinner was under two hours.  Due to space limits, my second review will be more to the point.  For more details on the dishes keep on reading my original review below.
