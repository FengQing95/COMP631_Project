The Pit Room////Can't come to Texas without eating BBQ. The Pit Room was a good intro but I wasn't blown away. The boo and I shared the Three Meat Dinner with Brisket, Pork Ribs, and Venison Sausage with Mac n Cheese and Brussel Sprouts. Looking at the photos other people took vs. what we got, it seems like we got way less meat, but I could be crazy. The brisket was juicy, fatty, and flavorful. The Pork Ribs, on the other hand, were disappointingly dry and flavorless. We enjoyed the spicy sausage, but the Brisket was by far the best protein. The sides were good too, and I could've eaten more Brussel Sprouts. Good smoky BBQ, but I prefer my BBQ with lots of sauce.
