Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Blueberry Danish Pancake which had cream cheese on the inside of the pancake and loved it! My boyfriend ordered the Benny Duo where you can choose two if you wanted to try two types! RECOMMEND doing the duo if you want to try a little bit of both. He got the Chilaquiles Benedict and the Bella! Bella! Benny. I preferred the Chilaquiles one because I'm a huge fan of Mexican breakfasts and the barbacoa was very tender and paired well with the stack of tortillas. The Bella! Bella! Benny felt much lighter with the balsamic and arugula if you would prefer that.
