Kata Robata////I wish I came here sooner!! Our server was Tai, he is amazing. He knew his menu and made awesome suggestions and gave us amazing service. We started with the truffle Madai, that was delicious. The chef sashimi platter for two, the kobe skewers that melt in your mouth, oxtail ramen, salmon belly and scallop nigiri, lobster Mac n Cheese (amazing but heavy) the green tea cheesecake and the blueberry soybean cake (yum!!!). Overall, the experience and food was amazing, can't wait to go back.
