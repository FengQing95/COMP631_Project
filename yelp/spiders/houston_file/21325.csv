Uchi////I didn't get a chance to check out the menu or the pictures on YELP before coming to Uchi, but I had good reviews from all my friends and family. I'm visiting from California, so it will be a while until we will be back in town. Whenever in Houston, I would like to try a few new places since the food is different than in Cali.
