Uchi////I have been here several times, and they never disappoint. Although they pack out right away, they can usually seat me at the bar or community table. By far the best sushi I have ever had (and I have tried sushi all over the country). I love their cool tastings, and usually order 3-5 of them. The taste, freshness, and presentation is amazing! They just opened in Denver, so I hope to try that location next. They have valet parking in the back. Only negative is their website says they take reservations, but I have never been able to make one (always get a message saying nothing available) and I have tried days & weeks ahead.
