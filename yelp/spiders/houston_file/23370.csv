Uchi////Server was knowledgeable, attentive, and nice. Runners were all good with the exception of one guy stumbling/mumbling badly when delivering a dish. I really liked how the waitress took all of our order and decided how to send it out for us. She also tailored the pace (as she said she would) based on our feedback.
