Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was great. I give 4 stars because I asked for coconut on my pancakes and I got it anyway. Not that it's a strong flavor but after an hour and a half wait.. I expect perfection. The mimosas were strong and very good. I got a pancake flight and it was delicious. My friend got the benny duo and there were no complaints on her end.
