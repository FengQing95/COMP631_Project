Baby Barnaby's////I like sitting inside and watching the fresh orange juice get squeezed, which means of course I have to order a glass of one because it's just too good to pass up! Have always wanted to sit outside in some pleasant weather but good luck. If you get lucky enough to get one of those tables, I'm sure you'll spend your sweet time enjoying it. :)
