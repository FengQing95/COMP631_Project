Baby Barnaby's////This is one of my favorite places in houston. I've had a lot of the items on the menu and my favorite is by far the green eggs- cheesy and artichokey. The coffee and juice are fresh. They allow dogs on the patio and if there's a wait they provide complimentary coffee. The interior is tiny but that's part of the charm I think. The pancake is singular but enormous and the waffle is superb as well. My boyfriend loves the chicken sausage but it has like a fruity/sweet flavor so I usually opt for the bacon.
