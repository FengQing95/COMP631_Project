The Pit Room////Fantastic briskets, I feel like this is what Texas BBQ should be all about! Got the pound of briskets and finished it all in one sitting. Going to try my best to use the correct BBQ terminology but the smoke ring looked great, the crust that packs so much flavor, and incredibly juicy inside. As one can imagine, it is on the pricier side, but well worth trying while in Houston.
