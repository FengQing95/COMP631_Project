JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Britney - Thank you for your review. I'm glad you were able to find a ramen that suits your fancy. As Houston has quickly become one of the culinary epicenters of our great nation, its myriad citizens have also developed a wide variety of tastes and preferences. So as a restaurant, it can be quite difficult to devise a menu that enough people will come back to try repeatedly.
