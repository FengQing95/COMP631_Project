Kata Robata////Kata Robata rarely disappoints me. The interior is really cozy and chic. Our server is super friendly, professional and knowledgeable. He recommended a lot of good stuff. I love foie gras here. Doesn't smell weird like other restaurants I've had. Uni is rich and flavorful. I don't really care for the rolls tbh. Omakase was standard. I had the matcha cheesecake for dessert and it was bomb! A++ for the food decoration. Would love to go back and try new things on the menu.
