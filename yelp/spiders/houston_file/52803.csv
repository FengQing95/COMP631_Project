Kata Robata////Great evening with friends who love fusion sushi. Gotta admit though, I'm bias in favor of Uchi, having gone there since they first opened in Austin. I really enjoy the pairing of foods to bring out the natural essence each ingredient. One thing that does make Kata Robata stand out is that there are more cooked-food options, compared to Uchi that's mostly raw with a few cooked items. Great, attentive but not intrusive service too!
