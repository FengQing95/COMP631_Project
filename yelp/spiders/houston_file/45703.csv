Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hands down the BEST chocolate chip cookie in H-town. Houston press did a chocolate chip cookie tasting article back in September 2015 and ranked common Bond as #2 (Tiny boxwoods was #1). Having tried both, I definitely favor Common Bond's. The cookie itself it big and fat, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, with goey chocolate chips and walnut pieces in between, it's the epitome of perfection in every bite. SOOOOO good. The only reason I visit Common Bond is entirely for their chocolate chip cookie. Warning, one cookie will set your wallet back $3.50, but TOTALLY worth it if you are a cookie lover. Word of advice: If you are planning to share you cookie, do yourself a favor (and your buddy), just don't. Each person NEEDS their own cookie. You'll thank me later.
