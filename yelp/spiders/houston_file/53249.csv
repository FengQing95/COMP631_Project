Kata Robata////My rents (aka fabulous foodie parents) told manager James that I love Japanese food and eating in general, and he suggested they bring me for omakase when I came to town.  We had reserved sushi bar seats, but before we started, we enjoyed drinks on the house at the bar.  I had the green kimono *iitchiko/midori/blue curacao/green tea/lychee* and it was terrific.
