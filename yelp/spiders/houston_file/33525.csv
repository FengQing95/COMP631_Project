Local Foods////My girlfriend and I were visiting Houston for a wedding a couple weekends ago, and we met my parents in Rice Village to do some shopping. Around lunch time, we were trying to figure out where to go. I remembered that I had been to Local Foods several years ago, so we decided to check it out.
