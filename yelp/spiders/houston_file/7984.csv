JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Michelle the new server was awesome! Also lisa or linda(pretty Asian bartender) was freakin awesome she made a margarita after another bartender told me she didn't have the items to make it. The spicy shrimp cilantro ramen was ahhhhmazing. Worth the wait and the hype! Get there early so you don't have to wait. It would've been 5 stars if the first bartender had ever been more helpful.
