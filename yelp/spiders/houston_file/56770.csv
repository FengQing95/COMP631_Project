Kata Robata////...and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I love dining with a group because each person is able to share their menu favorites, and nothing ever disappoints. I think my favorite dining experience was with Yelper Victoria M - who can probably recite the menu - and I made it a point to try plates that I've never ordered before. Yes, it ended up be a $300 dinner for two (drinks and tip included), but I was blown away with the variety of cold and hot plates.
