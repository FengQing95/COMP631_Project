Uchi////Been here a few times now. Food and service are always excellent. Reservations recommended. The menu can be overwhelming as there's a lot to choose from, and if you are not familiar with Japanese cuisine/terms, but still don't worry there is a great knowledgeable staff who will describe to you everything and will help you to order what your there for. What I had there, everything was amazing and will prepared. Environment was clean and I felt so safe while eating there.
