Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Update, we went back after the night of not so great service, but ohh so delicious food. Second time is a charm, for sure. It was such a change of pace from the hectic Friday night we had before. Going during Lunch is definitely the move. The atmosphere is great during the day and the wait staff seems so much more relaxed. The food was fantastic for sure, but this update is for the service. Jose was so gracious! We didn't know what to drink, and he suggested some surprised mock-tails (Kentucky Cup/Spring Fling). I am so glad we went back for another try. Most definitely not disappointed. I cannot stress how much we enjoyed the lunchtime vibe.
