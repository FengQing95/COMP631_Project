Local Foods////Best sandwiches in Houston. Good place to eat. Can also take the sandwich over to Kelvin Arms, or just back to your place. Typically I go with someone else so we can get the crunchy chicken and something else and split them. The pastrami is really good. My favorite sandwich was a roasted beef and curried cauliflower, but I think it was a special. If you ever see it, order about 4 and keep them for lunch every day that week. The gulf shrimp + crab is also excellent. I see no reason to get the Banh Mi when so many other places in Houston offer incredible 2$ Banh Mis. I think the sandwich prices are worth the quality, but I can't imagine this one is 5x better than a one at a Vietnamese place. Someday it I will get the truffled egg salad. It's my dream sandwich. I think my knowing that I WILL go back and get it is why I have pushed it in favor of trying others. Someday...
