JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Tonkotsu Assari which is -- Pork Chashu, Kikurage, Green Onion, Seasoned Egg, Spicy Bean Sprouts. The pork was soft and not bland at all; the seasoned egg was tasty, and the broth was nice and hot too. The noodles were my favorite part though; they were slightly salty just so they wouldn't be bland and chewy. This is the only ramen I've had from here, but I feel like anything from their menu would be good. Definitely coming back and recommend!
