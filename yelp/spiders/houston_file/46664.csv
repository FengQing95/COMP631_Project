Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Parking sucks.  I had to park near Walgreens.  Friendly staff but annoying to some because of the excessive talking.  Menu had too many dishes with too many ingredients and with stupid, weird titles for breakfast.  NO WAFFLES on the menu!  Service was relatively fast.  Ordered traditional plain pancakes (sweet potato pancakes???  Please!) and scrambled eggs.  Food took some time to cook and came out cold.  I saw a fly flying around the place.  The pancake (just one!!!) looked rather large and had white powder on it.  I didn't like the look of it.  Eggs didn't look like they were scrambled but almost omelet like looking with green veggie something sprinkles over it. The pancake tasted like green algae water which was gross.  The syrup (brought in a small cup which was a stingy act) tasted watered down and not so rich.  The butter on top of the pancake was rock hard, wouldn't melt and tasted bland.  The eggs were bland and lacked the necessary buttery taste for scrambled eggs.  The tap water made me feel bad.  I quickly ate and left.  THIS PLACE SUCKS.  The reasons why they want to add so many different ingredients to breakfast are TO HIDE THE BAD TASTE AND THEY CAN'T COOK BREAKFAST THE RIGHT WAY AND MAKE IT TASTE GOOD.  They use too many ingredients and some unnecessary from too many places which makes the food taste funny and weird.  If you want real traditional breakfast, then go to Le Peep.  My stomach hurts with major grumbling and gas pains after eating at this place.  I won't ever go back.  BTW, the restaurants in the Montrose area are nasty as hell compared to the ones near the Galleria and perhaps even The Heights so don't even bother getting anything in that area unless you want to feel bad.
