JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So before going, I heard that the tonkotsu black was salty and if you didn't eat a lot of salty, then don't order it. So I ordered the tonkotsu white. At first, I thought, wow this is really bland... But if you ate it with the pork, the pork is super flavorful and will give you all the flavor. They offer fresh garlic, and that makes a HUGE difference!
