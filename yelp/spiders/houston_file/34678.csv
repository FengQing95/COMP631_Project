Local Foods////Love Local Foods! Situated across the street from 24 hour fitness, Local Foods offers a variety of salads, sandwiches, and occasionally great plates that are perfect for a wide variety of casual yet upscale eating in Rice Village. Tonight I had the special of the day, which was a delicious water buffalo meatloaf served atop veggies. Definitely highly recommend Local Foods whether you're looking for a post workout meal, or if you're looking for a nice casual lunch or dinner!
