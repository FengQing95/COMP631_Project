Uchi////We came for our anniversary. We sat at the sushi bar. We had our own sushi chef and it was a great experience. Our chef was friendly. The drink was amazing. Theirs no word to describe the delicious food that we had. The ambience was really nice. Theirs nothing wrong with it except for the parking. Oh yeah one more thing, be sure to make reservation. It's really busy and I understand why.
