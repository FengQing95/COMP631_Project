Uchi////You know Houston is FULL of delectable food - copious prime choices that leave you unable to decide even when you're starving. Uchi is hands down one of my favorite restaurants here, and actually my favorite sushi restaurant in Houston. This place has just gotten better than it was a few years ago and I now relish my experiences here every single time. Pretty much everything here will not disappoint; even the onion rings here are the best I've ever had. One of my favorite nigiri's is the fois gras, and a refreshing surprise that I would also highly rate is the avokatsu roll. The only problem is that this place is so good that it's always hard to get a reservation at a good time if you don't plan ahead; but hey, that's a good problem to have - good food is worth waiting for. Thanks Uchi and keep up the great work!
