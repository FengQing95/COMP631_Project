Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Got here at 7:30 am, plenty of parking. The place appears small but it's actually pretty spacey. It stretches to the back area too. I Sat at counter and ordered cortada with almond milk (shot of expresso with milk), pancake flight with pineapple upside down cake, peach cobbler , & sweet potatoe with a side of thick slices Pork belly bacon. Very nice bar tenders and servers. After being served and as I ate, the bar tender noticed the topping on my sweet potato pancake was incorrect so he pointed it out( I hadn't noticed) and had the kitchen make me another one. He noticed I had asked for the bill in advance so he had them box the corrected pancake and brought it out to me really fast. The food was very tasty. The service was awesome! I can't wait to go back and try something else. The guy next to me said he loved his meal too, whatever he had. The parking lot was packed when I left at 8:15am. Street parking was full bc of the apartments in the area. So come super early and be ready for great food & great service. I'm impressed for sure!
