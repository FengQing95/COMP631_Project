Uchi////The menu is superlative.  Though they have entrees, the tasting menu (hot and cold) is an opportunity to explore many different flavors, creatively combined.  The hama chili (yellowtail, chili, orange) was brilliant, the yokai berry (salmon, pear) were delicious.  For hot, I'd recommend the bacon tataki.  A wagyu beef special was excellent, as well.  But you really need to go for the sushi.
