Baby Barnaby's////I walked in with my friend at 11 am as a first timer into barnaby thinking it was baby barnaby for brunch and I was greeted with a horrible attitude by the host. He yelled at me and said "THIS IS FOR LUNCH, BREAKFAST IS ON THE OTHER SIDE". I was in utter shock at how I was treated because I've heard so many good reviews about this place and I was disrespected by the host. Then, we walked into Baby Barnaby's waiting to be seated but no one even acknowledged us and had to ask the host where to sit because we didn't know. After we sat down, the waitress came to us and handed us the menu and asked us what we wanted to order immediately after giving us the menu. We had some questions regarding the menu because we had never been there and she looked at us like we were dumb. We felt forced to order the first thing our eyes layed on the menu as she indirectly forced us to pick something quick. Overall we were stared at in a creepy way because we aren't regulars or their "kind". Wouldn't recommend going here
