Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been to bosscats for brunch twice now and I have loved it both times! The restaurant is located in a very nice, upscale part of town. Parking was not too difficult but it does share a lot with a few other restaurants and boutiques. The first time I got the fruity pebble French toast. Something that surprised me about it was that the French toast was that it was not on the traditional French toast bread and had a pretty thick, crunchy crust. It was definitely a very aesthetically pleasing dish to take pictures of and the flavor was really good as well!
