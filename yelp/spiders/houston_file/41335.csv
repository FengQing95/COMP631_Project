Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pretty good. There is a great selection to choose from, depending on what you're in the mood for. I got the chocolate mascarpone tart and a cafe breve while my brother got the hot chocolate and a vanilla scone. Everything was very good. One downside is that there are no drink sizes but they compensate by having cups that are a good medium size. Decor and ambiance is nice as is the dog friendly patio. Would definitely recommend.
