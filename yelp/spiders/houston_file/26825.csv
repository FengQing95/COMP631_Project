The Pit Room////I went to The Pit Room by myself for a late lunch yesterday, I have eaten there before and it was good (see my previous review). So at the counter I ordered a beef rib, spicy beans and cold slaw. I proceeded to the pay station, paid my bill and said I was just drinking water and was handed a insanely small cup from the cashier. I got the fixing's from the self serve area, onions, jalapenos, spicy carrots etc (I like spicy food). I sat down and everything was good but indeed had some fire to it, so the tiny water disappeared quickly.
