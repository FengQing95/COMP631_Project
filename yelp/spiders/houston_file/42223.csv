Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Went on a Saturday morning during brunch hours and the line was out of the door. This place is not very spacious so expect a wait during peak hours. Very modern and clean design with a hipster ambience. They have a assortment of bakery goods at the counter. They have a breakfast/brunch/lunch menu if you want a meal. The kitchen closes after a certain time I believe. AMAZING COFFEE, and cute art for your lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.
