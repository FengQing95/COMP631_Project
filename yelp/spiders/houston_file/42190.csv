Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've gone to Common Bond twice in the past two weeks to try and work and both times the wifi has been down / not working. It connects to my phone but not to my computer. So as much as I wanted to sit with a cup of coffee and get some work done- I've never been able to! I recommend that you check the wifi before you order something to drink / eat so you don't waste your time sitting without a connection.
