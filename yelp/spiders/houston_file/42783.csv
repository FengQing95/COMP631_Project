Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pretty sleek and upbeat place. Hella packed all the time which suggests the place is amazing. Coffee was good and pastries were as well. Not a big fan of their entree selection but that's just personal preference. No parking usually, but they have a second lot.
