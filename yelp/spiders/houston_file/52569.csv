Kata Robata////I love finding great sushi restaurants.  Kata has a happy hour which makes their yummy food cheaper.  The yakitoris are probably the one of the best I've had in Houston.  I would recommend the beef with sea salt.  The mussel dish is also pretty darn good.  Apparently many customers request a bowl of rice to eat with the remaining juices.  There's a very good selection of various Japanese dishes, so you don't have to eat sushi if you don't want to.  Of the ones we ordered, they were unique and very fresh.  Foie gras at a sushi restaurant?  Yes please!  Don't be afraid to ask your waiter/waitress what they recommend.  It's always fun to try new things.  Service is superb.  Your drink will never be half empty.  I definitely look forward to my next visit.
