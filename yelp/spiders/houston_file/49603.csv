Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Omg this is the best place ever!!!! I had the OMG French toast and the breakfast burrito with sausage! Soooooo good! Really good friendly service. I had so many questions cause the menu is huge!!!! The only downfall is parking but there plenty of parking on the street if your up to walk a few feet.
