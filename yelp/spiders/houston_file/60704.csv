Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the eggs + potatoes + biscuit + bacon, and boyfriend got the famous green eggs. In my opinion, the green eggs were a little runny, but the flavor was great and I suppose we should've specified our preferred softness of egg. My breakfast was super filling and super satisfying, and dat biscuit was amazing! NOTABLY, the potatoes here are GOOD. I am used to ones that are too soft or something, but these are crispy on the outside and soft and warm inside, and are seasoned super well. I am SOLD.
