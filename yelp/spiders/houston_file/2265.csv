JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went for lunch on a weekday. Even though there were a good amount of people there, we got our seats pretty quickly. The waitress checked on us pretty frequently to see if we were ready to order. After we placed our order, it took a long time for our food to come out. In the mean time, our waitress was nowhere to be found when we wanted more water. When our food came out, both the 2 pieces of meat and the egg were cold and the soup was lukewarm. The noodle was decent (in that they were not super soggy). I would not be going back again.
