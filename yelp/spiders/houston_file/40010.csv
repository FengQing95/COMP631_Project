Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The Ahi Cucumber Tuna Salad (not pictured) was a banger; we finished that in two bites. Light and refreshing--there's nothing else I want from a salad. The Steak and Potatoes and Bosscat Burger were good, but I wasn't particularly wowed. The beans were a little undercooked, and the potato patty was slightly soggy. However, the steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare. The burger could've used a little more seasoning too, but overall it was still a good burger. I would come back and try the dishes not on the HRW menu a try.
