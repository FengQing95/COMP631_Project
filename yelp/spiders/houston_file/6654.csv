JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When our house is slow, our bartenders have more time to chat and interact with customers in the traditional sense; however, during peak hours, especially on the weekends, our bar turns into a New York City deli counter during lunch rush: Customers want their drinks and their food, and they want them fast sans errors. Occasionally the bartenders can banter and maintain their smiles, but during dinner service they are handling drink orders and to-go orders from the approximately 80 other seats in the restaurant, so things can get a little stressful.
