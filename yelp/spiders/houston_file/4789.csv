JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had the Crispy Chicken Ramen and some pork bun... Delicious! A little loud, but didn't interfere with conversation. Staff was pretty attentive, waiter came up to us quite a few times. About a 30 minute wait for a table but I'd say worth it! Dropped them down a star cause 1 waiter spilled water all over someone and they didn't offer them anything for it, and I ordered the special and it took quite a while to make cause they ran out of it and had to make more. That's like going to Whataburger and then saying we're out of burgers. Get your act together.
