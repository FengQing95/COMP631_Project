Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great selection. Team oriented service so there is not a chance for bad service. The food is super awesome and lots of choices. Did I mention that Yellow Bird Sauce? I am so glad Whole Foods carries is as Snooze turned me onto it and the sauce company is an Austin company. The wait may be long but they are unmatched in Houston. GREAT WORK TEAM!!!!! =v )
