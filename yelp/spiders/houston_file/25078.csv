Uchi////Amazing dining experience. For starters this place does not feel like it is in the middle of a busy street in Houston. For my reservation i sat at the bar & I highly recommend this. The servers were helpful, friendly, & very knowledgeable. Â This was a tasting experience & every roll, dish, appetizer, we tried was 10/10. The popular items listed are a hit & this place just feels like a hidden getaway in the middle of the city. Highly recommend & plan to return.
