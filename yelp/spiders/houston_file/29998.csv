The Pit Room////Just OK. I had heard good things about this place so was excited to try it. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. First, the meat was cold. Also the portions are small for the amount you pay. For example, you get exactly 1 rib with the dinner plate if you choose that as a meat for the dinner plate. I had the pork ribs and it was a bit of a fight to get them off the bone. Mac and cheese was bland. Elote was good as were the green beans. Pickled onions not pickled enough. All in all I've had better and I'm not in a rush to come back. A bit underwhelmed
