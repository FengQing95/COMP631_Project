The Pit Room////For food, ended up sharing a 1 meat dinner plate with the beef brisket which comes with two sides, which we opted for the mac n cheese and the cole slaw. And in addition to that, an a la carte order of the beef ribs or beef rib as we only ordered one giant bone. Believe me when I say this enough food for two. All orders seem to come with some slices of white bread and their sweet and spicy bbq sauce which was excellent to dipping and lathering up those juicy pieces of meat.
