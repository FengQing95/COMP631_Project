JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been told there is no good ramen in H-town. But Jinya has broken that rumor for sure! I like the lighting and inside decoration with wooden tables and chairs. Our server Cindy was nice and gave us prompt service. I had the Cha Cha (for garlic lover) ramen and my boyfriend had tonkatzu black. We also ordered extra topping of the poached egg which is REALLY GOOD!! The egg is soft and the inside has a rich flavor. We had Annin Tofu for dessert. Love it so much! If you are craving for good ramen and good service, this is the first choice for sure!!
