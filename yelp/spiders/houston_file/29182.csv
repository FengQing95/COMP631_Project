The Pit Room////Ordered a 3 meat dinner plate to sample as this was my first time here. Got brisket, beef sausage and pork ribs as my meat selections. The brisket was amazing, perfectly seasoned and tender. The Czech beef sausage was also good. The ribs were a bit of a let down though, small and dry. I got double mac and cheese as my side. That was pretty good too, the sauce was creamy, just needed some S&P.
