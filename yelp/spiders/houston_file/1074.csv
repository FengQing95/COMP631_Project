JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love the atmosphere. Great for socializing and having drinks with friends. Can't go wrong with Long Island ice tea, lychee Moscow mule, and sake bombs too. Crowded of course on a weekend. Ramens were perfect temperature. Try the tonkutso black ramen (not sure on the spelling) or spicy pork recommended! Appetizers were great too!
