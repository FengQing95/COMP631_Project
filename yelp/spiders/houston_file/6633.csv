JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For appetizers, I've tried the takoyaki, crispy chicken, Brussel sprouts tempura and Jinya bun. All are pretty good, but my favorite is the Jinya bun. As for ramen, I've tried the tonkatsu black, which is my favorite, spicy miso, and the spicy chicken broth. The spicy miso is my least favorite as it was too salty for me. I also wasn't a fan of ground pork as the meat. The spicy chicken and the tonkatsu black comes with sliced meat, which is more appealing to my palate.
