The Pit Room////The service was very friendly. Oh, and did I mention they have several local beers on tap and an outdoor bar area to sit too? What a great hangout. A server told us that it gets packed on Fridays through Sundays though, so get there early if you don't want to wait/want to get a table! It's not that big inside. But check it out! Definitely a great addition to the restaurant scene.
