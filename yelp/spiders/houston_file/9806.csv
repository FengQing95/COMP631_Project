JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Seriously this was the best ramen place in houston so far. I've tried, ramen JIN, tiger den and some other ramen places but it doesn't compare to this. If you live around houston, then this ramen place is to go! I got the spicy tonkatsu with corn and it was amazing! I didn't even have to add in any spice or anything! Â
