JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm a huge fan! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I went here on a date during a cold day in November and it was amazing. For a ramen spot, this place has a great ambience. I was expecting something like Tiger Den on Bellaire; kinda cramped, lines out in the cold, an in and out kinda place. Jinya was not that at all. It's open late at night, with a great ambience, and great food.
