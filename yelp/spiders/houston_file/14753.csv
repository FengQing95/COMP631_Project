JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Danielle - Thank you very much for the great review. I'm glad you were able to miss the dinner rush -- you're right, things pick up around 7:30PM-8:30PM and sometimes don't let up until well past 10PM. In the coming months we plan to open two more locations, which hopefully will mitigate these wait times, but for now, we do our best to keep the tables turning without rushing anyone along. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
