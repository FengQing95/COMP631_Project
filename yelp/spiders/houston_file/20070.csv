Uchi////So this is my new favourite place...Ever! My old favourite was Nobu and it's just beat it! So, this is saying something. How do they make food so dang tasty???? Omgosh! Yes, it's a little pricey, hard to get into on a weekend and what's with the shot glasses of water? Felt a little deprived of h2o but who cares when the food is soooooo freakin delicious! ;) Service is delightful, cocktail was good and did I mention the food is out of this world?
