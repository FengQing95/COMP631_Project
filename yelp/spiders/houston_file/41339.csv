Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Heard a lot of hype about how crowded this place would be, so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to order and sit fairly quickly at 1PM on a Saturday. The space has high ceilings and windows all around, allowing for a lot of natural light, which is nice. The decor seemed a little over the top trendy, so I prepared myself to be underwhelmed by the food. A friend and I split an almond croissant and the vitello tonnato.
