JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The classic tonkotsu ramen is ramen noodle in a pork-based broth complemented with char siu (Japanese grilled pork), seasoned egg, and other ingredients. For me, a Japanese ramen either succeeds or fails depending on the broth, and while Jinya's tonkotsu broth is up to my standard for flavor, the broth lacks the richness that I had expected. Char siu is also sadly lacking in flavor. However, the firm noodle definitely compensates these faults, and the seasoned egg (an often overlooked component) actually steals the highlight.
