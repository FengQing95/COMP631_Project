Baby Barnaby's////I Love this small quaint breakfast cafe. It was a cold wait this time due to the weather but the warmth and yumminess of the food was worth the wait. I ordered the French toast with bacon and potatoes, sooo good! Every time I come here the service is fantastic and the food is hot and fresh! The bacon has thee best smoked flavor ever!!!! If you come by here, don't leave without ordering a side of bacon, you'll thank me later.
