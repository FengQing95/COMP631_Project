Uchi////I have to admit, I was a bit hesitant to try Uchi because it was so hyped, and I've had excellent quality sashimi before in New York, so I was wary of Houston quality. That being said, this place did NOT disappoint. Even the friend I went with, who had only ever had bad sashimi experiences, acknowledged how Uchi went above and beyond.
