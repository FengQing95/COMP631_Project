Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In all, get there early. The food is really good. I was over MARIAH and her antics, so if/when I return I'll make sure not to be serviced by her. Side note....Slim Thug ( yes the rapper) came in a few minutes before we were finished. He and his crew were waiting for tables by the door and guess who wanted to make sure all her coworkers were aware MARIAH. Oh and guess who wanted to make time to go up and speak to him, MARIAH. Here's a tip, how about check the rest of the silverware you're giving out instead of "ke-ke-ing" it up in some rappers face.
