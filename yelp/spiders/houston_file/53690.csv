Kata Robata////Softshell crab and salmon roll was decent. Sushi pieces (fatty tuna and salmon) were pretty good. Libations were unique - I ordered some sort of strawberry (maybe raspberry? I can't remember) granita. The strawberry puree / mix came in one glass and the liquor in the other. You had to mix the two so the ice from the mix would chill the liquor. Pretty creative, I think.
