Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Now this is where it's a little disheartening. The folks behind the counter are accommodating and friendly, but they did get my order wrong. Make sure you check your box. The folks running the food or even cleaning the tables were like table Nazis. You can't reserve seats even if you have someone in the line ordering. You MUST have a number otherwise they won't let you sit. They will stand there, berate you, and just watch you without helping you even if you drop something. Oh did I mention they want to kick you out as fast as possible? I get it. There's lots of people, but wow...doesn't make the experience like Europe at all.
