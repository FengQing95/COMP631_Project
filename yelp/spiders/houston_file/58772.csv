Baby Barnaby's////I came here for breakfast and was not disappointed! I ordered the green eggs with vegetable sausage and it was soo good! The orange juice was super fresh. The service was okay not bad but not amazing. Nothing to complain about. It's cheap and you get a lot of food! How can one complain?
