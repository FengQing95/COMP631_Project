Uchi////Excellent experience!!! Have the chef or your server surprise you... it is to die for!! Worth every penny. This place is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Texas and California combined... and trust me I have been a sushi lover for close to 18yrs. I have lived in Cali and Texas... here are some of the photos. Word cannot express the experience. Enjoy!
