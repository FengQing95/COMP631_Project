Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Menu: we got the boudin potato salad and the chicken torta. I personally prefer the torta because it was more like a burger, the flavors were bold and fresh, the bread was delicious, and the portion was a good size. It came with a side of pickles which I believe we're made in house (not sure if I really liked the pickles). The boudin was decent, but I wasn't a big fan of the flavors. For someone who grew up in the south, maybe I have higher standards for boudin, so this wasn't my favorite dish. We ended up picking these 2 dishes because most everything else on their menu was sold out, so beware and go early!!!
