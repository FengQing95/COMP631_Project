JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////He recommended JINYA Tonkotsu Black and it was perfect! The way the egg was cooked was so awesome, the noodles were a bit different from what I'm used too but Kevin explained why they're cooked the way they are and offered to remake the ramen with the noodles cooked differently. I told him that wasn't necessary but it was nice they offered.
