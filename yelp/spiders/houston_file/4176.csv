JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cute place, good service, great lively vibe! Currently they are doing some work in the garage so parking was a bit of a mess, but as long as you take a deep breath you are fine.  My husband and I had beer and sake, tofu salad and both had ramen.  I had a spicy chicken ramen and he had a ramen with pork and Brussels sprouts - both were really good.  I thought everything was a great value and will return soon!
