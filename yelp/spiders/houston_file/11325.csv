JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sharon - Thank you for your constructive feedback. As soon as I saw your one-star review, I immediately contacted all three of our JINYA locations and had the floor managers order the Salmon Cilantro Sashimi and the Spicy Tofu and report back to me their findings. All three managers said these dishes tasted normal to them.
