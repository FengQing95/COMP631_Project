Uchi////Been here multiple times and the food and service have always been excellent.  We ordered the omakase tonight and all the dishes were delicious.  For our meal tonight, we sat at the bar and the chef was very friendly and professional.  The chef started the meal by feeding us mostly raw stuff which was fantastic.  We were pretty hungry so we really enjoyed all the dishes brought to us.  The waiter did a good job asking us how full we were at different moments during the meal so they could gauge what to serve next.  Being pretty hungry I thought I could eat there forever, but after they started sending the warm and more filling dishes, I started to see the end of this rainbow of a supper.  We had a fantastic meal and the wait staff was very professional throughout.  One of the best Japanese restaurants in Houston!
