Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Sunday Brunch Choice: My first time here and the vibe was upbeat and welcoming. They had a DJ that was playing all the hits from all different genres. He had me dancing in my seat.  FYI call and make reservations ahead of time because it gets pretty busy during brunch.  They give you 15 minute grace time if your late.  Also they have valet, garage and street parking available. Service was Great as well.  Starting from the hostess stand, down to our server and the bathroom attendant they all were Great and ready to assist in any way.  Food was good and hot. Drinks were good too. The wait was not bad at all.  I will definitely be going back.  Thanks for a great start to my Sunday Funday.  See you all soon!!
