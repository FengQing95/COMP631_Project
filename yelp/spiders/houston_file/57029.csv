Kata Robata////These are just a few if you're not sure what to order. They also have daily specials which is always changing so try something new before it's not there anymore! Service is top notch and it's a busy restaurant so it can get pretty loud. Even if you do have reservations, you might have to wait a little bit. Bring a jacket as well since it gets pretty cold in there. I haven't had a chance to but I do want to try their omakase one day.
