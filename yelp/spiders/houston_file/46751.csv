Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I need to try other things on the menu, but ordered the breakfast burrito and it was not good. Basically a chimichanga, you coulnt eat it wrapped with your hands but rather had to eat it jumbled and messy on a plate submerged in a bunch of sauce. The insides were 90% mashed black beans. Expensive (9.25 meat not included), big, but not good.
