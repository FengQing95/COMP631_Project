JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went back for round two when some classmates wanted to go so I decided to tag along. And maybe it was just the ramen choice I picked last time but I was very pleased this time around. Last time I got the Number 1 this time I got the premium white ramen with takoyaki (of course) and it did not disappoint. Made sure to get there before the rush came in so we were seated upon arrival and food came out fast. If it's like this for trips to come I will be back for more.
