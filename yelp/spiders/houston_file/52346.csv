Kata Robata////Went again and was blown away yet again. Although I could have eaten everything on the menu, we opted to try the Restaurant Week menu. Miso soup was by far the yummiest I've ever had. Fried green tomatoes on a bed of super flavorful grits was outstanding, as well as the pork belly which melts in your mouth. The boyfriend got the kobe beef (he always outorders me) and I got the scallops. The kobe beef plate looked more like a snack (not sure if that's always the portion or because of HRW) but amazing. And not a dessert fan but the strawberry shortcake and banana bread completed this awesome meal. Kata is definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Houston and we can't wait to go back.
