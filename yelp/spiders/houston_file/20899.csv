Uchi////I stayed at the hotel next door, and first night's arrival, I just wanted to grab a quick dinner.  Sushi sounded great, but I wasn't sure how authentic it would be.  I was completely taken by surprise!  Everything I ordered was absolutely delicious!  And the waiter was so nice!  He would recommend items and explain each dish that arrived.  It was so good, I returned 2 nights later!
