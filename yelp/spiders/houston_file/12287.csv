JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////THE FOOD: Now i would talk about the menu but i didnt know 98% of what was on it (even though it was in english). So our waitress recommended the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen and the pork pieces were melt on your mouth tender and full of flavor. My wife had a... I don't know...it was some kind of chicken noodle soup thing but shes not important lol. Anyway, the food was delicious and i tried this strawberry soda which I have a picture of and it was very good but it's a little tricky to open. Our waitress had to show me how to do it and I should have recorded it but I was in awe at the three or four steps you have to take in order to drink it lol. It was really cool!!!
