Baby Barnaby's////Amazing breakfast place and for the price it's outrageously good. The parking situation is a bit complicated but worth it. The french toast is great, it does come with cinnamon so if you're not a fan of it just ask without it. The potatoes come in great quantity and trust me, you'll be glad it does. We didn't wait too long and they were super nice. Loved the place definitely going back.
