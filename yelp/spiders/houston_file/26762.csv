The Pit Room////This was an awesome place.  The food was delicious and there was plenty of it.  The staff was super friendly.  Brisket was moist and smokey.  The sausage had jalapeño and cheese in it and was delicious,  but a little spicy for my tastes.  The turkey was good but I feel it could've taken a little more smoke.  The sauce was great.  Not too sweat, spicy or vinegary.  Just right on all three levels!   I was just visiting Houston but the next time I'm here I'll definitely go back and have some more great BBQ!
