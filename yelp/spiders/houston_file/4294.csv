JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy (pork broth, pork chashu, thick noodles and medium heat spice) and I thought that it was going to be out of this world delicious considering the line and packed seating. To my dismay it was a slightly above average bowl of ramen that was beautifully presented for $10.95.
