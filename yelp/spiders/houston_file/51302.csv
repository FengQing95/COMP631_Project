Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Staff were friendly. Appeared to be a short wait for a table. I went and sat at the counter. Ordered some hot tea and half order of pineapple upside pancakes and chicken sausage. Pancakes came without syrup. I thought to automatically request some but decided to taste without. Very yummy n sweet unless u REALLY want syrup. Who doesnt love drowning pancakes in syrup? Â Just a little weird but doable so I resisted. I prob could live with or without the chicken sausage but it was pretty good. But those pancakes tho!?
