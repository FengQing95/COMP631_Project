JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The appetizers by themselves already stood out. The gyozas were steaming hot, crispy, and flavorful, but a tad bit small. The fried chicken bites were just as fresh and juicy. And then came the ramen, and the 2047502745 toppings you could add to it, including FRIED ONIONS. but even the fried onions couldn't be compared to the noodles. I cannot emphasis enough on how satisfying the thick noodles were. Soft but yet SO bouncy, soaking in a broth that had a perfect amount of flavor and not too salty or creamy. The chashu was so tender and the egg yolk still runny. Hands down by far the best bowl of ramen I've had in Houston.
