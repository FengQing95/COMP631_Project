Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Worst service. Had a reservation & I booked it 20 miles out in advance (the app only allowed to reserve if your within 20 miles) which is fine. I had a reservation time of 1:30 & got there to check in at 1 PM (just in case there was earlier seating) we didn't get seated til about 2:15 PM. MIND YOU WE MADE A RESERVATION AT 12:40. They seated MULTIPLE parties before ours. I understand one or two parties, but at least 6 parties of at LEAST 5 people each. Each time I asked the host when we will be seated she had an attitude & kept switching the stories on which table we would sit at twice. Most of my party left at 2 Pm, so 2:15 (WHEN MOST OF OUR GROUP LEFT) they seated just 4 of us. Worst server. Bad host. If I can get less stars I definitely would, sucks cause Snooze was my favorite place to go til I received such horrible service.
