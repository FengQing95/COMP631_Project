Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food & drink menu is ridiculous, I wish I could have tried them all! We did try the Pancake Trio (chose the sweet potato, blueberry & pineapple upside pancakes) the Snooze Classic, Breakfast Potpie & the Snooze Spuds Deluxe. Everything was great but the favorites had to be the bacon & sweet potato pancake. The iced chai & bloody mary were also a hit.
