Local Foods////I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago..... I had the truffled egg salad and the crunchy chicken (shared halfsies with a friend). It was SO SO SOOO GOOD!! Â The "ah, melts in your mouth" kind of good. I can't wait to be back. I've been thinking of this place ever since....The problem for me is that it's a bit of a drive. But who cares, I don't mind the drive for some yummy food at all. I'll be back very very soon...
