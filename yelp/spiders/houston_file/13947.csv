JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tyler - Thanks for the great review. I believe you visited us during Houston's first (and maybe only) cold snap of 2017. We experienced much higher traffic during days that were normally pretty slow. Thank you, though, for your kind words regarding our food and for your understanding. We hope to serve you again soon.
