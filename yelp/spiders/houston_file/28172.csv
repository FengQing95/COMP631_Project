The Pit Room////This place has potential to be great. But, anyone on Yelp who is saying this place is better than Killen's right now is smoking some good stuff (no pun intended). I really hope they succeed and make some minor tweaks. Houston really does need a true barbecue restaurant (like the ones in ATX). Â And I feel The Pit Room can be great.
