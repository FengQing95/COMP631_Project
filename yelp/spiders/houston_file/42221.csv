Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm a local and used to eating the best quality baked goods Houston has to offer-so needless to say, my standards are high. Â CB does not disappoint. I purchase baguettes bi-weekly (and I slice and freeze for use as needed), I splurge on their chocolate chip cookies (cut into 3 and share w/ someone you like) and I just plain love going in to people watch while I drink my decaf on Saturdays. It's just a great place to hang out before yoga. (PS. check out Pralaya across the street-best yoga classes w/ incredibly knowledgeable instructors.)
