JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Was recently here for the first time with a group of friends. It's a great place for medium to big sized groups or just 2 or three friends. I've personally never paid $10.00 for a bowl of ramen but, this was really good and the atmosphere was bad ass. Very good experience and I will be back for sure.
