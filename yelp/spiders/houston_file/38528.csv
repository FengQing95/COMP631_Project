Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay, so my husband had the boss burger this burger was amazing. The ONLY thing was he ordered it well done and it came medium well. BUT, it was so good, he wouldn't let Jeremy replace it lol. Unfortunately I didn't get a bite bc of the med. well, but my husband literally devoured it! The wedges were so fresh and hot, soft on the inside, we took the rest home with us! WHATEVER YOU DO ORDER A SIDE OF PICKLES! I got to try the homemade pickles because my husband do not eat them on his burger and I DEVOURED ALL 4 slices! I WANTED SO BADLY to ask for more lol! They have such an unique taste and flavor, if you are a pickle lover.. dude, trust me, ask for a few! They really need to jar them and sell them! Anywho , My husband drank St. Arnold Lawnmower. He said it taste better than the karbach lovestreet. ‚Äç
