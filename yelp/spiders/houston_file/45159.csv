Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I used to go to common bond every week. However, their coffee is terrible now, I guess they switched brands. Either way the salads are good, pastries are good. Parking sucks, but the atmosphere is really great. A nice place to have breakfast... minus the coffee.. it's basically brown water
