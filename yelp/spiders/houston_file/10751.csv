JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have said this once, I have also said this twice, I'll say it for a million more times: jinya's has the BEST mf'ing ramen a person could ever wish for. I have searched high and low for a ramen bar that offers not only delicious broth, but also decadent add-ins and properly boiled ramen... this place is it. It literally cannot get any better than this... If you have somehow managed to find a ramen bar better than Jinya, PLEASE hmu bc I've died and gone to heaven at this place and I'll gladly re-die and return to heaven again for another taste. We went before my flight back home on a weekday and the wait was no more than 5 minutes, the food took no time at all to arrive, and I even made it to my flight over an hr early... that just goes to show how fast and efficient their service is.
