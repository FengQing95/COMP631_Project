Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For starters, the service, ambiance and food was incredible, 10/10 without a doubt! My partner and I are always seeking multiple dishes every order and we decided to choose the OMG! French Toast and the 3 Egg Omelet with tomatoes, spinach and goat cheese. Needless to say every bite was burst of savory flavors in my mouth! Everything was fantastic and the French Toast was the BEST I've ever had, better than my mom's family recipe! Can't wait to go back to this place when I visit Houston again and try the numerous egg Benedict options on the menu!
