Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Had to come here again on Sunday because I think I have a clinical addiction to the blueberry danish pancakes. The only upsetting thing was watching a group of grown women act like idiot children and verbally assaulting the hostesses for having to wait. Seriously y'all, they were damn rude. I will continue to be a loyal Snoozer for life!
