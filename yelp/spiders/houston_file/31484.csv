Local Foods////If they had a downtown location, I would eat lunch here everyday.  First off, the staff was incredibly friendly and very personable.  They seemed very invested in the business and it reflected in their service.  The food was definitely excellent and at a decent price point.   I had the gulf shrimp and blue crab sandwich with sides of quinoa and beets.  The sandwich tasted very fresh and definitely satisfied my seafood craving.  The sides were brilliant - both the quinoa and beets were unique to me in their preparation and flavor profiles.  We had a few of mom's homemade desserts, which were all gluttonously delicious.  I really need to come by again when i am in the area...
