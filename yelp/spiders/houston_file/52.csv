Local Foods////My husband and I had lunch here on a weekday afternoon. Nicely renovated space in the old Antone's, friendly counter staff. The look is typical farm-to-table industrial chic (which I like) and there's lots of natural light and room to move around. Â There are wide communal tables and comfy banquettes. We ordered the egg-salad sandwich with truffle oil on a pretzel roll, which I felt could go either way: totally awesome or seriously weird. It was, in fact, awesome. The truffle oil was just enough to give the egg salad some richness, but not too much that it felt heavy. The pretzel roll was inspired, warm, not too salty. I could eat one of these every day. For sides we got the beet salad and the butternut squash salad, both were really good, a satisfying combo of sweet and acid. We also had the avocado and potato and leek soup, which was a little salty but still had great flavor. And last but not least, the mint lemonade with grapefruit was delicious. Everything here seems really considered, and executed with care. The Village has been waiting for a place like this for a while - I'm not sure why it's taken so long for Houston in general to get the kind of casual foodie place that NYC, SF, and LA have in spades, but I'm glad it's finally here.
