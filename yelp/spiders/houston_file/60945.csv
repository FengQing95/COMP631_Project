Baby Barnaby's////1. Service - the staff here is great. Very friendly, and they seem to have their system down. The wait can be a bit long, but it's all worth it. Put your name on the clipboard, which is hanging on the pole near the door. Listen out for your name when they call it. Wait can be crazy like 30 to 45 minutes sometimes.
