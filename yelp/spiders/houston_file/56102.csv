Kata Robata////We got the salmon roe nigiri by accident because the server accidentally brought it to our table and never picked it up so he just said it was "on the house" meaning he messed up lol (my bf was a server so he can relate.) Also it was my first time trying salmon roe too and it was decent. It's like fish-flavored popping bubbles (I can't believe I just described the flavor of a dead fish's eggs that). We also ordered the usual, spicy chopped scallops and it was the highlight of my meal.
