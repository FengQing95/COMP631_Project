Uchi////Apparently despite being there multiple times, we are not hip enough for Uchi. Sat at the bar waiting 45 minutes for a table we had a reservation for, watching walk ins get seated ahead of us. Asked about our table and got a snotty response from the guy managing the seating. Needless to say we finally bailed.
