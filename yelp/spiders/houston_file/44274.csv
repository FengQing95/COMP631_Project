Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my favorite place to grab coffee in the Montrose area. I especially like their matcha lattes and cappuccinos! My favorite dessert item is the almond croissant and their walnut chocolate chip cookie is ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. Parking can be hard to come by especially at peak hours but its worth it in my opinion.
