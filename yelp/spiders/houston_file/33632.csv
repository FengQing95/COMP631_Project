Local Foods////The sandwich was everything people have been writing and posting pictures about. A moist deil-style chunks with mayo lettuce tomato and some kind of "crunchy"nut type topping on a pretzel bun.My two side options was chips and fresh watermelon slices. Â It was to hot to sit out on the lovely patio , but I was able to find a sunny table next to the window. Everything was fresh and delishes. Personally I thought the limeade drink was a little to sweet and tart for my taste.
