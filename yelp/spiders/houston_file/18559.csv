Uchi////Uchi is one of my favorites. I love the thought and care they put into their presentation as well as the timing of the dishes. Unfortunately, the timing of the dishes was done very poorly my most recent visit. I went with friends and often 1 person at the table would have their dish and it would be 10 minutes before anyone else got their plate. Additionally, we ordered the foie gras nigiri and got it in the middle of our meal instead of at the end when it is usually served. One of the plates we ordered was forgotten but they quickly rectified that. The actual food was still exceptional, but the experience as a whole was 4/5
