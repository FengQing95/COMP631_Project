Uchi////Since opening, this outshoot of the beloved Austin restaurant has become a culinary Mecca for locals, celebrities, critics, and everyone in between. Situated in a star-studded stretch of Westheimer, the building is low-key and there's complimentary valet out back. The inside is moody and elegant, from the antechamber made from stacked wooden planks, to the "bar" where you can watch master sushi chefs at work, to private and communal seating areas. It is notoriously difficult to get reservations, so either plan ahead or avoid peak hours. For more budget conscious individuals, there is a Sake Social each day from 5:00-6:30 PM where you can sample some of their most popular courses at a smaller scale (and cost) along with cheap beer and sake. There is typically a line, so make sure all members of your party are present as close to 5:00 as possible.
