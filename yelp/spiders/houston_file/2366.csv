JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi ST. - Thanks for your great review! I'm glad you enjoyed our fare, but apologize for the shortcomings of our ambience. I agree that loud music in a restaurant is not for everyone, and I'm the type who enjoys dinner over soft music. However, JINYA's business concept is geared towards a trendy and loud atmosphere. It's not going to be all things to all people, but those are the guidelines we are required to follow as a franchisee. I will relay your message to corporate and hopefully we can make some changes in the future.
