Kata Robata////I've been going here for some time now. (8 to 10 visits this year) Not because I love this place but because it close to my work.   The food is pretty good and the fish seems to be fresh.  My dining experience there has been pretty positive, staff is friendly and the service is pretty quick.  They seem to know the menu and eager to help their customers.
