The Pit Room////We stopped by the Pit Room during our visit back to Houston and this place is the same as I remember it! Absolutely delicious BBQ, not very many tables, long lines that move very quickly and tables that clear up just as fast so finding a seat isn't usually a problem. Finally was able to get the beef rib before they ran out since they run out relatively quickly every day. If you're craving beef ribs... Then these are great, but I will say that I've had better beef ribs before so if I ever come back again I'll likely stick with brisket considering how insanely expensive the beef ribs are here. Don't get me wrong, they're very tasty and if you read other reviews these seem to be the best beef ribs a lot of people have had, but in my opinion they're not worth the price tag. The okra side was delicious as usual and so was the brisket and venison sausage.
