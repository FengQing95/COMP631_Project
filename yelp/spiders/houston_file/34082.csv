Local Foods////I thought it would be a regular fried chicken sandwich but boy was I wrong! Juicy cut chicken breast (not fried) with the nut crumble made it seemed like I was eating a crispy chicken sandwich. It was so savory and delicious and it may be my favorite thing off the menu by far. The lemongrass chicken soup had a really interesting flavor. It had some sweetness to it. I liked it but it wouldn't be something I would order over and over.
