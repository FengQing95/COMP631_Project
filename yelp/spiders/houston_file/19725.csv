Uchi////Door shut tight 6p on a Sunday evening, prime dinner time on a non-holiday week. No updates on website, yelp or Google. Not even a sign on the door to apologize for the inconvenience. My girlfriend and I took that as a bombastic insult. Then I called the restaurant; the automated answering stated that restaurant was closed for staff to "enjoy their holiday with family and friends." Just as we were walking back to our car, we saw another jubilant couple bemused by the emptiness of the restaurant's dim lights and rejected by the same insult.
