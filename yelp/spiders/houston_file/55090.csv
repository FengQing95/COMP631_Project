Kata Robata////If I was basing this solely on the Spicy Soy Miso Ramen, it would be a blow-me-away five-stars with fireworks. That soup is to DIE for, and I will order it every time I go back until they no longer serve it. The spiciness, fresh noodles, soft-boiled eggs, rich umami broth... so good. Moderately spicy, so those who don't like their faces burned off can rejoice. The rest of the food was also quite nice, if missing the subtlety and refinement that I was expecting. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing, but it was little things: the jalapenos on my sushi roll were clumsily sliced, the chunks of meat on our braised beef were just a bittoo clunky, the broth for the other ramen dish was just a touch bland, etc.
