Kata Robata////Close at 3 pm?  We arrived at 2:46 pm and host told me last call is at 2:45 pm.  Turning down a $200 lunch for two. Very bad business decision.  Need to put on your door closed at 2:45 pm because 3 pm is false advertisement and a waste of a customers time.  Plenty of other great sushi places around in Houston and will not be coming back.
