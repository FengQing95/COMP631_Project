JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Probably some of the best ramen in Houston. I had their special spicy ground pork ramen and it was very good. They have varying levels of spice, with two "off the menu" choices: inferno 1 and inferno 2. I tried the inferno 2 and it was pretty spicy. Also tried the fried chicken pieces and dumplings and those were definitely worth trying. They also have an extensive bar menu with great drinks.
