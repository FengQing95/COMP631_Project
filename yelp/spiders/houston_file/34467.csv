Local Foods////Since I was confused by the place I'd like to give a tip. There is a cash register and you do order at the counter (lol).Thank you to the yelper who wrote that because I was extremely confused. The cashier we had was very nice and easy to talk to. He explained everything to us about the place, recommendations, and also exchanged pretty awesome small talk in my opinion. He also came by to talk to us when we finished out meal which I always think is nice. A+ for the service.
