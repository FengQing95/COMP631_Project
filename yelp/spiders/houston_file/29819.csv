The Pit Room////Coming to Texas, I knew I had to try the barbecue. I got here at around 7:30 pm, and there was a line out the door. Although the line looks long, it moves very quickly. We only waited for around 20 minutes before ordering. Although it looks small, there's extra seating in another area, so seating isn't a problem.
