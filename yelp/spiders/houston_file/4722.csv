JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the atmosphere they have created. We sat at a bench table which is great for large groups and meeting new people. Their staff welcome you in Japanese when you are being seated. They are very helpful in explaining their menus. They are a little pricey but totally worth it. I loved my food and if I had the money I would have bought another bowl of ramen. They really make you want to savior your food.
