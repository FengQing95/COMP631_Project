Uchi////Vastly, vastly overrated.  The food here was creative and interesting but at $30 a dish for a few bites, it's hardly worth the price.  Additionally, I couldn't stand the presentation.  Each dish was brought out by some bearded, grungy, Austin-y guy who gave a talk about how "super awesome" the dish was.  At those prices, I want to be the judge of whether it is awesome or not.  They could really do without the editorializing.  It rubbed me the wrong way.  Although the food was decent, I doubt I will ever return here.  There are better places to spend $200 on dinner.
