Kata Robata////I absolutely love this place! Great service and exceptional sushi. I wanted to cry when I finished the New Zealand king salmon. Was to die for. First time I went was on my birthday and my dad and I did the omakase. There was this fish smoked in hay and it was just about the best thing I had ever had. Went back yesterday for dinner by myself and was wishing they had it but they were out. I don't see it being overly expensive, but it is super easy to rack up the bill. I couldn't stop ordering things to try. Cannot wait to go back!
