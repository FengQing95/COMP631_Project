Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been to the one of the Denver locations and loved it.  This is a nice hip spot with a great menu and something for everybody. Great morning cocktails and by far one of the best breakfast menus you could ask for.  My first visit to the Houston location happened to be their soft opening so all of the food and non alcoholic drinks were free which was a pleasant surprise!  They also designated a non-profit to receive donations from the sales and guest.  It seems that they have the management and training in place to do well in the Houston market.  I was kind of skeptical of this space because it seemed too small from the outside but there is plenty of room and space once you're indoors....Overall our visit was great and I am sure I will be back often....
