Local Foods////A friend had checked into Local Foods 3 times this month, so me and another friend had to check this place out. Located in Rice Village, right next to Benji's and Thai Spice. This place is a gem. We got there around 2pm right after the rush hour of lunch, and unfortunately though we avoided the crowd we also missed out on the duck. (if they run out of a sandwich type it also means they are out of the ingredients within that sandwich.) But never fear the cashier was very patient and helpful with creating my custom order.
