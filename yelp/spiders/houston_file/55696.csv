Kata Robata////Been hearing a lot of hype for this place for awhile and decided to try it out. Service was friendly & attentive, the overall space was quite nice & had a good ambiance. For a weekday, it was surprisingly busy, but not too bad of a wait. However, they did not really live up to the hype for me unfortunately. Ordered the Foie Gras & Duck with Cold Soba because I heard it was a really popular must-try. The meat was a bit tough and there was an overwhelming hit of wasabi with one bite of the soba from the vinaigrette. There was not much that really stood out to me except the desserts. The Coconut Tres Leches Cake was very good with the coconut shreds on top & the Green Tea Souffl√© cheesecake with the red bean ice cream paired very well together. Honestly, that was the only highlight of the night
