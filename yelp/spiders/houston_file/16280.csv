JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For the main entree, I ordered the tangy cilantro shrimp ramen bowl.  A large bowl of red broth and thin noodles topped with a mound of cilantro.  Me likey cilantro.  Just beneath the surface of the broth were the four tempura shrimp.  Flavorful.  Tempura coating was obviously a little soggy but expected due to the circumstances.  The broth was a pork/shrimp mix.  It was spicy as hell and must have contained what I believe to be some sort of chili powder.  Great bowl of soup.  Would eat again many times.
