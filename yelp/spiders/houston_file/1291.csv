JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review of JInya Ramen Bar.  Believe it or not, I didn't really have my first bowl of real Japanese ramen until about two years ago when I traveled overseas.  At first, I didn't know what the big deal was about ramen in Japan.  Having been in the US all my life, I thought ramen was simply the prepacked stuff you buy in the supermarkets.  Once I had my first bowl, I was fan.  I began trying out different ramen shops all over and noticed that each one is different in their own way.
