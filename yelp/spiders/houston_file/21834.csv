Uchi////Son provided a couple of complimentary items (maguro sashimi and goat cheese & machi cure) since I was unsure of what to get. Finally ended up on the jar jar duck (lots of unique smokey flavouring), brussel sprouts (caramelized in a vinegrette chili sauce, slightly salty), madai, uni hokkaido (sea urchin), guytoro (short rib, melt in your mouth cross between Angus and Kobe beef), hotate (spicy scallop), and fried milk (iced milk in a crunchy coating).
