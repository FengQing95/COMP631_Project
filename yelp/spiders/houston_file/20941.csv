Uchi////I thought it wasn't going to be filling, but we were talking to our sushi chef at the bar and we received 2 other dishes on the house!!! I love sitting at the sushi bar! We also talked to the chefs about how they work at different stations and their experiences with food. And, two of them are working on some new costumes for a cosplay convention :) He encouraged us to get a little bit of all the components in each bite. Everything is there for a reason and I love tasting all the different savory/sweet/salty flavors with a crunchy texture.
