Local Foods////Wow! We have been here twice in the last two weeks and I already want to go back again!  The inside of the place has an industrial meets rustic feel.  If that is even such a thing.  It is an order at the counter type place, and all their sides are displayed so you can visually see what looks appealing.  I have tried the chips (similar to kettle chips), tuscan kale (sweet, and delicious), potato salad (ever so slightly spicy, and the best potato salad I have ever tried, and the cabbage slaw (tasty if you like slaw.)
