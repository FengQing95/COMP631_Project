Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The way I run to snooze at a moment's notice, no matter the long lines or wait times babbbby!!?? That's my spot! I once visited snooze and finished my friend's food during brunch. I'm not sure if the strength of the cocktail made me go hard like that or if it's because the server was egging me on, but it was delicious per usual. Every location is unbeatable.
