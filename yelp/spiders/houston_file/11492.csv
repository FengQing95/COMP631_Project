JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////the ramen was superb! it was my first time to try Japanese ramen, so it was very special to me as my first experience, and overall the taste and visual met up to my expectations. Staffs were very friendly, and the takoyaki was delicious. I give y'all guys an Oishi for your ramen. I would definitely come again.
