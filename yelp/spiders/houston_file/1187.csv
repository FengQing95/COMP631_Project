JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Don - Thank you very much for the 5-star review! We greatly appreciate it. And thanks for understanding our extended wait times during peak hours. We try to keep the tables turning when we get full, but it's also important to note we don't do anything that might make a customer feel like he or she is getting rushed along.
