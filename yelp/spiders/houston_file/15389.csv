JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's in Midtown off Louisiana next to Piola on the ground floor of the Mix @ Midtown mixed use complex that has the 24 Hour Fitness up on the top floor. They all share a tiny parking garage that fills up rather quickly. The parking situation isn't great but if it won't scare me off for the gym, it won't scare me off for food which I like much better than the exercise.
