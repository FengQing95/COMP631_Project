JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ordered the Tonkotsu Black which was just alright. Didn't come with bamboo shoots which I love, so I ordered it on the side. The bamboo shoots weren't the small, neat little rectangular slivers that are easy to eat. Instead, they're large slivers, that are annoying and have to be cut up in your bowl awkwardly. The mushrooms were just your basic mushrooms, not woodear, not even shiitake, essentially nothing worth an additional $2.00. The pork belly fell apart in the bowl which proved to be difficult to eat since you had to go searching for it. The broth was a little bit.. buttery? for my taste. Left a weird film on my lips that I just didn't care for. The egg and the noodles were good though...
