Uchi////Uchi's awesome. The sushi and other dishes are great and creative. They keep things fresh. What puts this place over the top compared to other Houston sushi places is the ambiance though. Great place all around. Highly recommend. Great place for a special occasion not cheap but worth it definitely. Ask your server for recommendations, they're usually pretty good.
