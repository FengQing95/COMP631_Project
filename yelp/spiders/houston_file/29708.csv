The Pit Room////The chicken was rich and decadent and the brisket was fatty and just melted on the tongue. I was super surprised when asked light or dark meat chicken and was given a leg instead of it pulled.  The elote was good, but the corn itself was kinda dry (the actual kernels. This place does not skimp on the delicious toppings.) The sautéed green beans were done up with butter, onions and garlic. Just dripping in butter.
