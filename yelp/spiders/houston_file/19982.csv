Uchi////Food was awesome, no complaints here but really wasn't my preference. I'd rather have traditional Japanese food over fusion any day but I can appreciate the creativity at Uchi. All in all we had a great experience and help from our awesome server that really made the visit memorable. Just wish they didn't run out of the fried milk which was the main reason we came. (though they did comp it's a dessert for that, so thanks Uchi!)
