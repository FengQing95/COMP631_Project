Uchi////jar jar duck countryside farms duck, kumquat, endive, rosemary smoke:  OMG if you go PLEASE order this!  Can I possibly be more emphatic??  It was amazing and actually our waiter said it was voted the best new dish in the South or in the US or something.  Whatever I was too busy stuffin' my face.
