Local Foods////My favorite is the truffled egg salad sandwich. I am really picky when it comes to the crap places usually put in egg salad... usually it's tons of mayo, pickled stuff, onions... and who knows what else! So my first time at Local, I asked them exactly what they put in the egg salad. You know what they put it in it? Eggs. Truffle oil. Done. It is seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I also LOVE their lemongrass soup, which has been there every single time I have visited except the most recent time I went... and I seriously was so sad. I asked the cashier what happened to it, because I was so upset. He said they keep their sides (and sandwiches, etc), seasonal... which obviously makes sense. I mean, their name is Local! They source local, in-season foods. But it made me so sad. I love that lemongrass soup.
