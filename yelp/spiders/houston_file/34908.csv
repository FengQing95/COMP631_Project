Local Foods////I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this one. The food is great. It really is. But it isn't mind blowing - maybe I should have tried that infamous crunchy chicken instead of the truffled egg salad. The bread was this strange sort of sweet thing, and the egg salad was definitely overflowing and delectable.
