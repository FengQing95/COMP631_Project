Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I fell in love with this place at first visit upon my first bite of their pineapple pancakes. Utterly divine. I went to the one on Oak Lawn in Dallas twice, once off 7th St. in Fort Worth, and the Houston Galleria location multiple times, and to my dismay I found that there was no consistency. I ordered the same thing every time--pancakes. Either the pineapple or the peach. One time I got a cinnamon roll pancake as part of that 3-pancake deal. Sometimes the pancakes would be the full width of the plate. Other times they skimped on the batter and it was a fraction of the original size. This last time I went--to the Galleria location--I called them out on the inconsistency.
