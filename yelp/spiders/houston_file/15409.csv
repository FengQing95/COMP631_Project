JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great atmosphere. Ramen was okay, I had the jinya pork belly and my boyfriend had the sprout ramen with pork belly. Never had pork belly that wasn't seared and hardly any meat, maybe that's their style but it was so mushy and fatty. Would recommend requesting them to sear it if possible! Also the pork belly bun bao, same thing. I personally don't like huge chunks of uncooked fat, my only complaint! Everything else was great!
