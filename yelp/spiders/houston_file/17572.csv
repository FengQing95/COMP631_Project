Uchi////Okay, I still have a love affair with Uchi's brussels sprouts but I have become disenchanted with Uchi in general.  I made a 7:30 reservation for a Wednesday night on a recent business trip.  We waited FORTY MINUTES to be seated!!!!!! Okay, seriously, take less reservations if you can't honor them in a timely fashion.
