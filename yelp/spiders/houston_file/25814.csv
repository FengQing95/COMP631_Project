The Pit Room////I ate here on a Wednesday afternoon and just wasnt impressed.  I asked the first person "whats good today" and his answer was the brisket and sausage.  Brisket?  Ok, great.  Sausage is your second best item?  I mean....ok.  So i told him brisket and sausage, but not the spicy sausage.  I dont handle spice well.  He gave me the deer sausage and it was spicy and dry AF.  The brisket was also super dry.  Which is a shame, because the seasoning was spectacular.  My gf then ask for the brisket and ribs.  I said, you need specify if you want beef or pork.  The guy says "we dont do beef ribs."  Well, its says on the menu on the wall above us.  I later realized what he meant was, its not an option on the combo plates.  Thats a big difference from, "we dont do beef ribs."  Wasnt crazy about the side options.  Cole slaw, potato salad, mac-n-cheese, baked or maybe sauteed okra.  The mac-n-cheese was awesome but the others i sampled....meh.  Tried my gf's ribs.  They were also super dry.  Lastly, was hoping to at least try a dessert, but their fridge went out taking all of their desserts with it.  I cant fault them for this.  Its not something within their control.  Just bummed i didnt get to try them.  All in all, been to a ton of bbq places and this one just did nothing to draw me back, other than the potential of trying to brisket when its fresh and juicy with the flavor profile of the dry version i had.
