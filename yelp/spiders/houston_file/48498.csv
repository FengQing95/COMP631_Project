Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Yummmmm! I love Snooze for multiple reasons, but their pancakes just might be #1. Snooze is so good that they are busy 24/7. You would think getting off work at 7:30 am on a Thursday would mean my coworkers and I would be seated immediately! Unfortunately not. Due to their popularity, they only seat you if your whole party is present. So while we waited for the stragglers and for a table to open up, we had some Mmm Mmm Mimosas at the bar. Once we were seated in the back (best location imo as it's further away from the hustle and bustle), we dove into our menus and ordered a variety across the table. If I see salmon on the menu, I'm most likely going to order it. So you can probably guess what meal I ended up with. The Benny Goodman eggs Benedict was hands down, fantastic! It's lox style salmon and cream cheese with poached eggs, cream cheese hollandaise and sun dried tomato and caper relish. Even with such an expansive menu to try, I would still order this again. My coworkers and I also split the Pancake Flight and went with Nana's Hot Cocoa Pancakes, Blueberry Danish Pancakes and the OMG! French Toast. All three pancakes easily cured my sweet tooth, but I think the Blueberry Danish was the best.
