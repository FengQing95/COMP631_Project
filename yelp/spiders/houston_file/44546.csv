Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Amazing. Just amazing. Their scones and cookies are all delicious, but their kouign amann...their kouign amann is life-changing. It's presented upside-down to showcase the thick chewy layer of caramelization on the bottom. The buttery layers are flakey and flavourful and melts in your mouth. Butter and sugar is healthy right? I can eat two more right?
