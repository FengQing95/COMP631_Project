The Pit Room////Really like the place.  When we walked in we were unsure of what to order.  We told the people at the counter that we were there the first time and they walked us through everything.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  The ribs were terrific and we will definitely go back.  Also, there are just a few parking spots in the front, but as we left we realized there is plenty of parking in the back.
