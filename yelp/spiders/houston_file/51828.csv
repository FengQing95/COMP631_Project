Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First, let's get the downsides out of the way: the wait for this place is famously long unless you go on a weekday and parking can be a hit or a miss. When I try to come on the weekends, it's usually around a 45 min - 1.5 hr wait, but you do have the option of getting an order to go. There are also some corn holes outside so you can kill time lol.
