Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The menu covers mainly American territory, with perhaps a Southern bent. The Portabello Mushroom 'Fries' were decent. The light crispy batter was solid and the smoked jalapeno sauce was excellent, but the inside was chewy and could've been cooked longer, plus it was under-salted. The Pork Belly Poutine showcased some fantastic soft, sticky meat, but there wasn't enough cheese curds and fries were yet again lacking in salt (though they were wonderfully crunchy). The Mushroom Quinoa burger was actually delicious, and I enjoyed it. The bun was perfectly soft, the juicy patty held its form, and the favors worked well. Finally, the Red Velvet Churros boasted ideal texture with a crackly outside and gooey interior, but I honestly didn't get too much red velvet flavor.
