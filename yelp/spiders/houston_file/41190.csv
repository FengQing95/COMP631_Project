Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my husband had to go back and stand in line to ask for some sort of way to compensate us for the difference between the salad and not-so-good eggplant. The cashier goes to get the manager and comes back saying she can't find him. Okaaay... so my husband asks for two lattes and a cookie. The cashier offers to knock off one latte and cookie to make up for the difference but he still needs to pay for the other drink.
