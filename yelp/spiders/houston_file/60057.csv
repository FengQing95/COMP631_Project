Baby Barnaby's////We live in Dallas and when in Houston Baby Barnaby's is a must for breakfast. Interesting location, building, staff, food and people watching. On April 1 I had delicious migas and Mrs. had regular egg and bacon breakfast. In the past we have usually ordered green eggs and ham with jalapeños. Coffee cups kept full and while waiting, and there's always a wait in this small place, serve yourself a cup and wait outside. Solid food.  We like the breakfast potatoes but would like a hashed brown option also. Tight parking in this residential neighborhood.
