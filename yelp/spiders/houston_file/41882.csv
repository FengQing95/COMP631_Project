Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This cafe is very overrated. I was expecting so much better after all of the reviews and after finding that the baker here is suppose to be one of the top bakers in the country. Perhaps I just went on an off day, however, my boyfriend agreed that the place was overrated.
