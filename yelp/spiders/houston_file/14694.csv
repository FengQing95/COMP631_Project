JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Overall I really enjoyed my experience here. I had the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, and it was delicious though slightly on the saltier side. Also, the Pork Chashu here is amazing! You can either combo it with your ramen, or better yet, just order a large bowl, which is what I'll probably do next time! Service here is also good despite how busy it can get.
