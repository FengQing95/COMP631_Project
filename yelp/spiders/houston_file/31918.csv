Local Foods////This place truly deserves 5 stars.  No wonder it's typically a wait at lunch because the have high quality, tasty, fresh food at reasonable prices.  I actually prefer the food to the full-service place next door (same owners) because it's healthier and fresher tasting.  Love this place - highly recommend.
