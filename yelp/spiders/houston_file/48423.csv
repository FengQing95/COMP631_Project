Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The only reason I cannot give 5 stars is because the wait is always crazy! It's always at least 30 minutes the past 3 times I've gone or attempted to go. In turn, it causes the food to take slightly longer. HOWEVER, the service is great and the food is delicious. I love that they are environmentally-friendly as well.
