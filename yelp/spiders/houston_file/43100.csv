Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2. Berry toast - 3.5/5 This is a french toast style pastry that is filled with berry jam and sprinkled powdered sugar.  It was really not spectacular.  It looked so fabulous but tasted very average.  I ended up bringing it home to heat it up in the microwave and it tasted a lot better.  Otherwise, it was pretty much dry bread with jam and some sugar sugar.
