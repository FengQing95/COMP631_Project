Baby Barnaby's////I went recently for a late birthday brunch with a friend I haven't seen in a while. Even though it was technically "brunch", my friend insisted I get something from the drink menu to celebrate my new ability to purchase alcohol. When we asked the server for two strawberry mimosas, we got asked for ID, which is normal. But the server didn't just check the ID, she stared, and stared, and turned them over and stared some more. She then walked away with both of our IDs and didn't come back for 15 minutes. When she came back, she hid our IDs with her hands and demanded we recite our drivers license numbers.
