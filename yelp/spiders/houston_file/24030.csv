Uchi////COVID2019: Â I mean this place is just amazing! They've been open since phase 2 and let me tell you...they are taking all the necessary precautions with cleanliness and % capacity. I stepped into other restaurants which were clearly not following the "25%/50%" capacity rule, but Uchi is. When you make a reservation they will ask you for you and your party's names and won't let you enter until people inside say its okay. All the employees are wearing masks and there's hand sanitizer for guests at the entrance. I've already been here 3 times this week for sake social and dinner, and each time has been great. Uchi is also offering patio seating outside now for those who want that option.
