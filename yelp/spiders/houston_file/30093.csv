The Pit Room////The experience was good in regards to the staff taking the order and helping with the take out experience. However, the food quality was pretty poor. We ordered brisket, coleslaw and potato salad. The brisket had good texture but the flavor was pretty low quality, by far this was the saltiest food we have had in a long time. The theme repeated in the potato salad and the coleslaw was overly acidic. Â Definitely not on my list of places to order from in the future.
