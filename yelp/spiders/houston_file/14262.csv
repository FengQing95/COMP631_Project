JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Again, if you're coming with a party of 2 or more, please make sure all guests are there at the time of arrival if you dont want to be skipped or overlooked. Food and appetizers are alright, service a little slow, but the food comes out at a timely manner. Their drinks are a bit overpriced and some too sweet.
