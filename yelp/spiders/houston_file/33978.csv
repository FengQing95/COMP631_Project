Local Foods////I ordered the Banh Mi with tofu instead of pork. It was absolutely amazing. HUGE sandwich first of all. Every bite was perfect. The pickled onions, cilantro, and fresh jalapenos were wonderful. The bread was perfect. Even the tofu was fantastic! My non-vegetarian boyfriend who does not like tofu took a big bite and LOVED it. I got it with the cauliflower and kale sides. Both were delicious but the kale was just perfect. I wish I had gotten a picture because it was a picture perfect sandwich. I ordered it to go and, despite the place being packed at noon, they had it out in 5 minutes. Ridiculous. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu.
