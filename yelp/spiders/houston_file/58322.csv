Baby Barnaby's////What a hidden gem!! Awesome food and service, all at a reasonable price - a perfect combination!  My husband (who does not drink orange juice), guzzled down two full glasses of their exceptional fresh squeezed juice once he tasted it!!  (The refill is free - where else can you get a deal like that!?)  Amazing... can't wait to return to this treasure of a restaurant.  We WILL be back!!  :)
