The Pit Room////Let's start with the deer sausage, it was a little dry but very tasty. My rib was not as fresh as I've had in the past but still very tender and finger licking good. My sliced brisket was cut from a new fresh slab. It was perfect, from the seasoning, to the juices from the cuts of beef to the marble of the fat.
