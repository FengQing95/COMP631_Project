Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really enjoyed the walk up counter. The line is usually long so try to get there early so you can make sure you have a table. The brownie was delicious but really rich so it was hard to finish. The almond croissant was perfectly baked and flaky and had a very strong almond taste. The coffee was amazing. I just wish they also offered matcha lattes.
