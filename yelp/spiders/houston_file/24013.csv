Uchi////Our waiter was amazing. He appreciated that we came for a culinary experience. We ordered everything that he recommended and it was ON. POINT. Each dish had its own personality, flavor, intensity AND was delicious with our sake and cocktails. I neglected reviewing this restaurant until now, but still I am salivating reminiscing about the experience.
