JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////jinya is the best ramen spot in houston! never had ramen in japan but my instinct say this is near authentic. flavorful broth, tender chashu, perfect soft boiled eggs, and amazing noodles. their appetizers and sides are equally as good. can get very packed on weekend but i never had to wait too long every time i come. staff are friendly and helpful. favorite place for ramen ever.
