Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time at this restaurant for a work meeting. We arrived right during happy hour, there's about 10 of us. Food and drinks were good, had the meatloaf and pork belly starters. Unfortunately this was not a good place for a work meeting, the music was incredibly loud and the service wasn't that attentive... but would love to go back to check out their whiskey room.
