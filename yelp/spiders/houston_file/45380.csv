Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Where to start. That's my favorite spot on a Sunday afternoon coffee and a bite. Had the burrata sandwich to die for. Also, we tried the lox and cream toast delicious. For dessert we had the kugelhopf with boston cream and the turtle brownies. Will come again to try more desserts
