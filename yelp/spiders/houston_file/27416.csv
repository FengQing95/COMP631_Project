The Pit Room////If you want some excellent Texas barbecue this is the spot for you! We have tried almost every meat here and they are all superb. I recommend the venison sausage and the turkey. Their sides are my most favorite out of any bbq place. Cole slaw is light but flavorful, the potato salad isn't overly mayonnaise-y, and if they have the charred green beans then it's a must to order them! Be warned though that on the serve yourself table the carrots and cucumbers are suuuuuper vinegary which is not a bad thing but it can totally catch you off guard if you aren't expecting it. It's nice that there are options for drinks as well, bottled beer or beer on tap on the bbq side of things and then a full bar on the other side with additional seating.
