Kata Robata////I came here with a friend for dinner on a weeknight.  We were early enough that we ordered the Tuna Tar Tar, Longhorn Roll, and Salmon & Soft Shell Crab roll off of the Happy Hour menu and all were very yummy.  We also got the Yuzu Marinated Salmon Sashimi and it was a refreshing citrus take on this classic sashimi.  A friend recommended the Tofu and Mixed Mushroom Truffle Oil Sauce and it was a healthy addition to our dinner.  Lastly, we ordered the Green Tea Souffle Cheesecake and it was a great finish to our meal.
