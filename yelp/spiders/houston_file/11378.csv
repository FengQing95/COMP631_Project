JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first official visit to a Ramen joint.  I will say I have a feeling they set the bar pretty high. The Tonkotsu Spicy was fantastic.  It was rich, flavorful and complex in flavors.  It exceeded any expectations I had.  My wife ordered the chicken broth ramen and it was very good as well.  If you are wanting max flavor go the Tonkotsu route, if you want a milder traditional flavor go the chicken broth route.  I am here for a week and I might even go back!
