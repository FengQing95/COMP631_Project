Local Foods////I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to new foods, especially raw vegetables. Although I try to be open-minded, I must admit that I'm actually really picky. But Local Foods demolished every single one of my premeditated worries. Their side dishes played a large part in this. Quinoa? Fantastic. Barley? Refreshing. Â Kale salad? Strange in texture, but yummy nonetheless. Turnips? Delectable. Cabbagee slaw? Absolutely to die for.
