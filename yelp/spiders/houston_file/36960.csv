Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here a second time to celebrate some friends' birthdays. Reservations easy to make. We were seated on time in a nice little nook area. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious!  Brunch grub is excellent!  The fruity pebbles French toast remains a favorite as is the meat loaf, but the short rib chilaquiles was a surprise delight (usually not a big fan of short rib). The veggie omelette was the best my friend has ever eaten!   Parking is valet, street, or garage. Ambience is loud - hard to hear each other talking - but just adds to the happiness of the environment. We are not a quiet bunch anyways.  Def recommend this place. Can't wait to try their $20 Monday night steak special which has had great reviews from other Yelp-ers
