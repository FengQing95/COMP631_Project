The Pit Room////Brisket, brisket, brisket, brisket, brisket, anything else I should say? Oh, yea their sausage (black pepper and garlic) is ridiculously good, I've been here several times and brisket, brisket, brisket......and the sides are no slouch either, had the charred green beans, very good. I have tried other BBQ spots in the area, and not close, in my opinion, and that also goes for their prices, reasonable. I don't know how long they have been at this location, since I have just returned to Texas and me being a native makes me remember how great the BBQ is, keep up the good work and please stay consistent.
