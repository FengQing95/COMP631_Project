Uchi////We first ordered the cold sake. Weirdly, the hot and cold sake are both $3 during that time, but the cold sake is served by the glass. Okay, fine. We ordered the happy hour pork belly dish. It was delicious but small. We ordered the walu walu. Again, wonderful but small. Then we ordered the sake crudo and the crispy tuna. When ordering the tuna, the waiter told us that it would take about five minutes to make. We said, sure okay. Thirty minutes later, the waiter came by to tell us it was coming, but the bar was really backed up. Forty minutes later, the waiter came by to tell us that the chef said it would be "two more minutes".
