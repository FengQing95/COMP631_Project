Uchi////For about 3 months now, I've been attempting to reserve myself a seat at the table of the once-monthly Community Dinner. Last month, my telephone call was answered at 11:03 AM (reservation line opens at 11:00 AM), and I was the first person to secure a spot--on the waiting list. Still interested, I called again this past Tuesday. Telephone call was answered at 11:13 AM this time. I was again offered a place on the waiting list, but not the first place. As I engaged the reservationist about the true possibility of coming off the wait list and actually being seated, she told me that she was able to offer 2 seats to someone for the most recent Community Dinner. This surprised and bothered me a bit because wasn't I the first person on the most recent dinner's wait list. However, she addressed my concern by saying that since a couple canceled, they replaced them with another couple.
