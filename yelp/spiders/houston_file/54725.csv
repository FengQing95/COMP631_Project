Kata Robata////Was in town visiting from DC area so my expectations for the Houston dining scene were a bit low.  Kata Robata was the real deal.  I read that one of the chefs (Manabu Horiuchi),  was a James Beard semi-finalist so that's cool.  Despite coming on a Sunday evening (typically not the best days typically for sashimi), everything was super fresh.  The Amaebi was awesome and the heads were fried to perfection.  Ikura and hotate were also super fresh. The grilled squid was really tasty and a huge portion.  The only disappointment was that they were completely out of Uni and there were several dishes that eemed like standouts that had uni.  All in all, solid place for high quality sashimi and robatayaki - and I'm sure the other dishes are worth trying.
