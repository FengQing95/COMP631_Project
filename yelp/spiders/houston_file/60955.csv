Baby Barnaby's////Little Barney's was a tight little cozy breakfast spot. Coffee was fresh, service was great, and the waffle was crisp and delicious. Seating on the patio was a little close to others, but once the food came out, that kept everyone from talking as much. We were checked on frequently. Better beat the crowd, because they will come and the tables will fill up quick!!
