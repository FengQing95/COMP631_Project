JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Probably the best if not only Ramen restaurant in downtown. The food was good and very similar to Tiger Den with very similar seating arrangement. The pork Kashu I ordered was very filing and tasted great, but I think I'll stick to the Ramen next time. Â The fried cauliflower was a complete disappointment and I highly suggest against ordering it. Stick to the takoyaki or tempura.
