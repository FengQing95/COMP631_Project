Kata Robata////Yes, I've eaten at Snap Kitchen, the Dessert Gallery, and now your place. I delighted in being there with my niece in your decorative atmosphere. For those who are not used to Japanese food, start with a rice and vegetable or rice and meat dish. For those who enjoy areas of new foods try this restaurant on your restaurant "bucket list".
