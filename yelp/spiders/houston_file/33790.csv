Local Foods////Salad and sandwiches are the main things on this menu, but wow they are good! I had the harvest salad and I feel like a better person for eating it because there were so many veggies in it. The restaurant has a modern cozy feel to it, and is very similar to many other farm to table restaurant concepts.
