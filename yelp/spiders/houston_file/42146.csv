Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Since it was my first time here, I didn't try a lot of pastries. The ones I did try were pretty good. I particularly like the almond pastry. It's got this nice almond filling inside and more toasted almonds on the top. The only downside is that these pastries are a bit too sweet for my taste, but maybe that's just me. The coffee here is strong and flavorful. Â Warm, bright sunshine light the space through floor-to-ceiling windows, making a brunch experience here quite pleasant. Very crowded and hard to find a seat, but that says something about the business, right?
