Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The place is good, as long as you are happy to wait and wait. The food is as good as you would get at any place dedicated to brunch, not exceptional, but on par with what would be expected. We got there for around 9.30am and we were told about an hour for a table which was pretty accurate as we were seated after about 70 mins. I'm not convinced anywhere is worth a 70 minute wait but we knew to expect something like that on a weekend morning. The staff are extra friendly, and actually that's why they are getting 3 stars, they could not be any more friendly and helpful. The brunch took about 30-40mins to arrive once ordered so not exactly swift from the kitchen. All in all, certainly a place to try at least once, if you are happy to wait. Also, bear Â in mind parking is a pain in the hole. They do have a car park but it's only for about 16 spaces and all the on street parking around the place you should anticipate will be full. We ended up on a side street about 4 away from the place and walked along but you can be circling for a while to find anything!
