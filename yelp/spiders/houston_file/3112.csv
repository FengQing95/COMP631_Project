JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Jon - Thanks for your review. Yes, it's true, parking just about anywhere in Midtown can be tricky and/or costly, depending on the night of the week, etc. Did you park in the free garage around the corner? If not, there is free valet on the bottom level and free self-parking on the upper 2nd and 3rd levels. We appreciate your visiting us, and we hope to serve you again in the future.
