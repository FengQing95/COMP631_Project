Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for my bf's birthday since he loves whiskey. Their selection plus the whiskey room gets 5 stars but the food was just okay for us. We started with the poutine. The flavors of the curds and bacon was good but our fries were very very crispy more on the side of burnt. We got the Madeline cornbread and they were delicious on its own but the sweet dip was just not for us. The hushpuppies were delicious and that's something I would definitely order again. For our entree we decided on the brick chicken. The chicken was nice and golden brown but the rice side was too seasoned for us. It wasn't just too much salt, the seasoning itself was a bit too overwhelming for us. We got a side of mac and cheese and although the title states it was sweet, it was just not for us. I liked how gooey it was but mac and cheese needs to be savory, not sweet. All in all we had a good time, the atmosphere is great for a group of friends. We probably won't come back for the food but definitely will for the whiskey.
