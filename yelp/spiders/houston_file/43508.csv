Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I ordered a chocolate chip walnut cookie to go. I came home about to enjoy my cookie. What I saw instead was a burnt, hard as a brick cookie- if that's what you want it call it! Why would they even serve this! It should be thrown away if they overcooked the pastries. If yelp gives me an option to rate zero star, then that will be my rating. But instead I have to give one star in order to write a review.
