Uchi////Unfortunately, our experience at the Houston branch was far from perfect and the manager there handled things in the least professional way possible. My wife and I visited Uchi for Valentine's Day and had expected the typical 5 star dining experience, which we initially did receive. The food was delicious with the exception of the Australian Wagyu hot rock and the wild yellowtail nigiri, no big deal, we were just trying things out. However...later that night my wife and I were struck with terrible food poisoning, By that I mean we were throwing up every 3 hours and were up until 4 AM. It was truly awful and I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. My wife had contacted Uchi Houston about this experience and the only thing they had to say was "we only serve the highest quality food." Thanks Uchi Houston for playing captain obvious, we know that from our many visits to the Dallas location but something was not right about this latest visit. The manager at Uchi Houston offered a half hearted apology and refused to admit error on their part, unprofessional to say the least (at least look into the issue or say that you will to see if perhaps there was an issue with the fish or the meat). Extremely disappointed with the unprofessionalism of the Houston management, maybe look into hiring someone that knows how to handle public relations? Uchi Dallas and Uchi Austin remains top tier locations but we will not be visiting Uchi Houston again. I don't know if they thought we were scammers or trying to get a free meal but that was definitely not the case and that is not what my wife had relayed when she called - we just wanted an explanation of what went wrong.
