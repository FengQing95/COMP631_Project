JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Great ramen place, we usually get the spicy chicken ramen and the vegetable ramen. The spicy chicken is really good comes in 3 heat levels, the only thing is I wish it had more veggies. The vegetable ramen is amazing, great vegetable broth I always get a seasoned egg and I make it spicy. The spice level used to be hotter but i think they might have toned it down a bit. Seaweed salad and the Brussels sprout tempura are great picks for starters. Yummy ramen, highly recommend this place.
