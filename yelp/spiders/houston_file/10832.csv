JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My goodness. This is sooooo good. I will be back frequently. I had leftovers from someone else's course and I was amazed. So I've been yearning to come ever since. I ate the whole thing, even after full! All I have left is this dirty napkin. I meant to take a picture before, not happening. Lol
