JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only downside to this place is that it's almost always packed. If you want to dine in prepare to wait, possibly even outside. Most of the time I get take out now, because their take out is just as good as the in store flavor. The takeout orders have separate containers for the broth and the meat / noodles / veggies / seasoned egg (uuuuuuh seasoned egg y u so good?!) so it's very easy to transport and if you have a longer trip it's easy to just heat up the broth in the microwave when you get home, which will warm up the whole dish.
