The Pit Room////A bit overrated in my opinion, I got the 3 meat platter with ribs, brisket and chicken., and a side of Mac and cheese and potato salad. The smoked chicken was the best part of the meal, the potato salad was second. The brisket was not as tender as I would have hoped, based on the reviews. And the ribs were fatty and just OK.
