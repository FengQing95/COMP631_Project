Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Brunch review: great atmosphere and scenery, cute places to take social media worthy pictures. I was disappointed in the food. I ordered the totchos along with the avocado toast. Totchos were soggy and plain with nothing great about them. The avocado toast was pretty hard to mess up but still not memorable. A carafe of mimosas was 30.00 which I felt was extremely high. I did try my friends fruity pebble French toast which was very good. However eating a whole plate of that would have been a sugar rush for sure.
