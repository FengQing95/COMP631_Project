Uchi////all i have to say is this place is worth every single penny! ive eaten at many many places but none compare to this place. everything here is phenomenal. so many different flavors and combinations of stuff its insane! writing this review im salivating wishing i could go back and eat it right now even though i was here one night ago. you MUST get the hamachi nabi and the hot rock with the wagyu beef. the sushi itself is great too. it literally got better and better with every bite. i cant find anything wrong with this place. it has to be my favorite place to eat of all time and i cannot wait to come back.
