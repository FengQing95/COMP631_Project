Baby Barnaby's////HORRIBLE service. My 3 girlfriends and I actually stopped by this establishment on a Saturday afternoon and it was of course busy, we were starving and luckily we did not have to wait too long for a table. The line was moving pretty fast. We got seated outside next to a middle-aged woman and her young daughter. My friend and I moved through the two tables to get to the bench side and we decided to switch seats so we moved back through, during that moment the lady next to us had her phone at the edge of the table and it fell down. My friend picked it up and gave it to the lady since the lady had no interest in picking it up herself, she just stared at it. As soon as we sat down she started loudly accusing us of breaking her phone, we claimed we didn't and if we did, it was purely an accident. She would not listen, we apologized maybe a hundred times but she would not have it. All she did was be incredibly rude to us and tell us we did not take responsibility for breaking her phone, we told her that she had it at the edge of the table so it was clearly going to fall off if someone's bag hit it while walking through. She kept claiming that if she hit our car then she would take responsibility for it. She was honestly trying to compare her shattered phone screen to hitting my car...she honestly should have put a screen protector on. Nonetheless, she was rude and when the waiter came back to her table, she loudly stated that we broke her phone and we were not remorseful at all (even though we already apologized). The waiter clearly took her side and said "girls, who broke the phone over here, somebody just shattered the phone." And we actually have that bit on video. Instead of being neutral, he took her side not even knowing if her phone was shattered before it fell. She obviously wanted us to pay the "$200" to get it fixed and since we are young students, we don't have that kind of money to be giving to strangers, especially since it was not intentional and we don't even know if was shattered before it fell. Later, he came back and gave us a piece of paper so we could "exchange phone numbers" as if we were getting the insurance company involved. This lady made all 4 of us very uncomfortable, and being young and naive, I wasn't sure what to do. The waiter came back to our table and asked if we wanted something to drink and we just told him it was best if we left since this place wasn't what we expected it to be and he responded in a very snarky manner "well it wasn't the place" and walked off. I was worried this would carry on so I found $50 in my wallet and gave it to the lady and told her this was all we had and walked off. We didn't even get to try the food but the service was so bad and it truly made all four of us uncomfortable. I later called my friend and told him and he called the restaurant and we found out that the waiter that was helping us was actually the manager  and he denied everything that he said. Good for us we have that small portion on video. Again, I'm sure the food really is good, but how is someone going to eat their amazing food when they are put in this kind of position. All the nearby tables heard what was going on which made it 10 times worse. In all honesty, if I  was in this situation, I would definitely not have accused someone for breaking my phone, I would be sad but I would admit it was an accident and if this lady had done the same thing and the waiter had not been one-sided, we would have definitely been more helpful. But both of their attitudes were unacceptable. Hopefully, if you go there, you'll have a better experience, but we will definitely not be back.
