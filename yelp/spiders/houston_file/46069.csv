Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Unfortunately it was this restaurant where we have experienced better. We went earlier this month and had the French Toast and Bacon which their menu states (and still does) "challah, vanilla-soaked strawberries, chantilly, maple syrup, apple-wood smoked bacon". The bread we were served was definitely not challah. When we asked a "manager" we were told that the bread was white bread and they were making changes to the menu.
