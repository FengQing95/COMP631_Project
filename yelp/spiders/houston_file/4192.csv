JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is super scary. I went to this restaurant Tuesday night before going to the sow at Scout Bar in Clear Lake. How did Yelp know? Any way for my first review ever I ate at the bar, nice TV. Ramen was good I don't remember the name of the dish it was the most expensive with pork. Bartender talked me into the egg it was a wise choice the yolk made the spicy flavors come out of the broth. The noodles were not as cooked as I would like them. Not really al dente but a bit tough. I am into the old fashion now, disappointing they did not have bitters to make one but they made a decent Manhattan.
