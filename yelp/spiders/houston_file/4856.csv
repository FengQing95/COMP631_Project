JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been coming to Jinya for a while now and it has become one of my favorite places to visit. My go-to is the Spicy Chicken Ramen. I enjoy the broth, it's absolutely delicious and they do not skimp on the garnishes. I also tried the Caramelized Cauliflower appetizer and It was great! I would definitely reorder those items again.
