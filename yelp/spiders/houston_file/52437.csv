Kata Robata////Went for the first time on Sunday. They open at noon and there were already people waiting outside. I ordered the 72 hr slowly cooked Kobe beef skewer which was the best meat I have ever tasted! It just melts off the skewer and is so delicious! I ordered the mac and cheese for my entree and it was very good. My husband ordered the spicy soy ramen and he loved it. He said it tasted like the noodles we would eat in Japan when we visited. The service was great.
