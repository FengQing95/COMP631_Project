Kata Robata////- Pork belly don ($16) - slow cooked pork belly, shiitake, spring onions, 60 egg (which means it was cooked at 60 degrees for 60 minutes). The poached egg on top of the don - you break it and mix it up with the rice. It made the rice so good! They are stingy with the pork belly though - only 3 pieces.
