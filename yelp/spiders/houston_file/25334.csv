Uchi////At this point, we were content but not stuffed. But our palates were fairly saturated from the onslaught of colorful and savory courses. The simple and refreshing summery strawberry-apricot sorbet with a crunchy butter crumble really hit the spot. The final throw-in was a savory miso-pecan bread pudding, which soaks overnight and goes in the oven for 20 minutes before getting the maple caramel sauce treatment. Crazy decadent and maybe could've used more sweet and less savory, but no complaints otherwise.
