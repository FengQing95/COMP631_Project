Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't believe that I haven't written a glowing review for this place already! Before I officially moved to Houston, I had to stop by here when I was visiting. Now that I live right by here, it is a privilege I will never take for granted. Common Bond is a world class bakery. I have had pastry and baked goods in the finest bakeries in New York City, Paris, and Tokyo, and this place stands up to the best. You can seriously not go wrong with anything you decide to order here. Their croissants are flaky with infinite layers, kougan Amman caramelized to perfection, sandwiches full of balanced flavor, first class executed breads. Their cookies, tarts, and other desserts are also to die for. If you are here around Christmastime, don't resist getting a pannetone, because the chef and owner Roy Shvartzapel learned from Iginio Massari, the "Michael Jordan of pannetone." (
