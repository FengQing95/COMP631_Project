Local Foods////The tag line for local foods should be tasty but come after payday. In my experience as a college student local foods is a great place for a lunch date, lunch with friends, or any kind of lunch activity. A sandwich with a sides or a soup ( I recommend there chicken pozole it fantastic) will be around 20 dollars. Although, all the food is fantastic, my favorites are the truffle egg sandwich, the garden Sammy or the crunchy chicken. The meal itself is slightly overpriced. I think it's a great place for a special lunch but I wouldn't come here regularly.
