Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Loving this new spot! Wish we would have come for brunch, my sister and I only got dessert there and it was to die for. Definitely worth the line we stood it. We just came at peak hour, when we left there wasn't a line. I love the atmosphere of this place and how it allows you to look out to the streets and all the natural light. We sat on the patio, the weather was perfect. Need to come back for the food ~!
