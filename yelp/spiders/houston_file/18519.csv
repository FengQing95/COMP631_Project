Uchi////Service was great.  The waiter was well trained and knew his stuff.  Ambiance was great.  Clean and modern with a good crowd.  The restaurant has only been open a few weeks so the wait was a bit of long, although the restaurant serves hors d'oeuvres and you can get drinks at the bar while you wait.
