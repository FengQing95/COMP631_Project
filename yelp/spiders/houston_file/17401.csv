Uchi////Some of the best Japanese food you can get in Houston. As a chef I was exceptionally thrilled as the food is excellent. I had a couple problems with the waitress that I had, but she over fixed the problems by giving us the item for free plus an additional item. The presentation is outstanding the food is unique and the only reson for the 4 star rating is the waitress. As she is the face of the company. Overall the food is a 5 out of 5. Highly recommended for people that appreciate food.
