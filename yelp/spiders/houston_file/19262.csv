Uchi////This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Houston. Â This evening we had the machi cure, shoshito peppers, eggplant, ham and eggs, oysters, uchiviche, zero sen, and some unfiltered sake. All topped off with their eggnog dessert. We sat at the sushi bar, which is an absolute must - all the activity in the kitchen really adds to the experience. The perfect date night for a foodie couple.
