Baby Barnaby's////Once we finally got a table, the food was sub par.  The coffee was no bueno, and cold at that.  (If you're going to be a reputable breakfast place, coffee is a big deal).  I got the green eggs, which turned out to be more cheese than actual egg.  This led to a gooey, unappealing texture.  The potatoes were cheap frozen potatoes from Sysco, nothing special.
