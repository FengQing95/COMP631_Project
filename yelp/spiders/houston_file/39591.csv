Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We decided to try their cocktails.  The husband ordered their Caribbean Mule and I got the Barrel Aged Cocktail (ordered the Manhattan).  Both drinks came out weak but drinkable.  For my second Manhattan, I asked to make it stiff so I got a double.  This time, much more respectable for a place that touts a list of bourbon and whiskey.  The second Manhattan is $16 for the drink + $27 extra for the double = $43.
