Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yaaaaaas I am in love with the croissants here. The almond one is my favorite! Last time I came here, it was sold out. I was bummed at first, but that sadness immediately went away when I began eating the chocolate croissant I got instead. The chocolate was so good...my mouth is watering thinking about it. How do they make their croissants so flaky?!
