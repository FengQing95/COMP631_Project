Uchi////I think I have a love/hate feeling toward Uchi. First of all, every single dish I've tried was so exquisite and unbelievably tasty. I specifically remember an oyster I had that left me completely speechless - it was packed with bursts of unique flavor and texture. I wish I had a dozen of those...but that would probably break my food budget for the next two weeks. We ordered a wide variety of other dishes that I can't remember the names of...but they were all excellent. I don't think you can go wrong with anything from Uchi. I say that with the utmost confidence. The brussel sprouts is a MUST TRY -so yummy! Even their fried rice was amazing!
