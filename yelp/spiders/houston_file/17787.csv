Uchi////I got to Uchi at 6:15pm and asked for a table for 6. The hostess said that it would be an hour and a half wait. (I was curious as to why there was at least 5 people standing next to her.) We were fine with that because our friends weren't ready yet. We decided to go to our friend's house because it was walking distance. When it came close to the hour and a half, my boyfriend called to make sure we were still on the list. When all of us got there they said our table was not ready. They asked us to go outside in the patio to wait. It was very small and congested because it seemed everyone was waiting. We decided to get a bottle of sake and wine. So at about 8:45 it was just getting ridiculous and everyone was getting agitated because they were hungry.
