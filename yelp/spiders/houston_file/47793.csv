Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have eaten at Snooze several times and keep going back, because I love it so much!  The staff is friendly and gives excellent service.  I love the healthy options, too.  It's hard to pick a favorite, everything I've eaten here is wonderful.  They use only fresh ingredients, are socially conscience and give back to the communities around them.  Parking can be a pain at this location, but it's definitely worth it!  Hands down, this is one of my favorite places for brunch!
