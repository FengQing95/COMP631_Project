Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food here is really good! I like breakfast food a lot and they have plenty of options for vegetarians. Their pancakes are huge and are interesting flavors and I've gotten their breakfast burrito as well as a dish with fried egg and hashbrowns (I forgot the name) which was also phenomenal! They also seem to have a bunch of options for Bloody Marys but I haven't tried any yet but they seem interesting. I only have two complaints. I've only been on Saturday morning and it's usually packed (45 minute wait) and their parking lot is pretty small as well. Other than that, it's a really good brunch spot!
