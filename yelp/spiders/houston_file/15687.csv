JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here on a a whim with coworkers during a work trip. The lychee mojito was very good, we all kept guzzling them down . For appetizers, we ordered the fried brussel sprouts and the edamame. They were good but not mind blowing. For main course, I had the chicken cheese ramen, which was delicious, I only wish I had gotten the spicy version instead.
