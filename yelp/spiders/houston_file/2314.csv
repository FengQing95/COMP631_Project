JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ambience is very urban. They have a community table where you can sit and get to know people while you eat or you can have your own personal booths. You can see the chefs cooking while you wait. They are very prompt in getting your meals on time. I believe you can order to go also. Definitely try it!
