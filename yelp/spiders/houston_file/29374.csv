The Pit Room////The mac n cheese and cole slaw were nice sides to balance out all of that meat. Had I noticed the okra upon ordering, I think I would've opted for that over the cole slaw. They also have a condiments area with additional sauces, pickled veggies, onions, carrots that are no additional charge. Yay!
