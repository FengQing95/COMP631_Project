Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time I came to common bond was because I needed a good place to study. From the outside it looks so inviting so I had to check it out. On the inside its even nicer! Not to mention, place smells amazing! This place is super clean and the staff is amazing and very helpful.
