Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First of all, their lot isn't small (I didn't notice the first time since we had walked over). It's more like there are too many people. I came in around 12 minutes before they opened at 9. I was not the first one and there were already 3 people waiting in front of the doors. I stayed in my car for a couple more minutes, trying to figure out where my friend was, until I looked up and found out more people had lined up. I didn't get there that early on a Sunday morning for no reason! I joined them.
