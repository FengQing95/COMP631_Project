The Pit Room////The food was delicious. I ordered the 3 meat (pulled pork, pork rib, brisket) potato salad and mac n cheese. The meat was fall off the bone on the rib, all of the meat was juicy and just the right amount of fat. The brisket was sssooo good. I will definitely be back the next time I am in Houston.
