Uchi////At first, I was a little tentative about eating here because I had such high expectations. To my surprise, Uchi blew my away with the thoughtful and Â creative dishes that came out of their kitchen. whenever i hear FUSION restaurant.. i think they're gonna be serving sushi adulterated by sickeningly sweet sauces or creamed in mayo. however this is definitely not the case here. Note: this restaurant is not for you if you plan to attack your food like kobayashi and inhale 2 lbs of sushi/fish. food is going to come out slowly. you're probably only going to eat a few bites out of each dish. out of a table of 7 we shared about 12 ish plates. they came one at a time (except for desserts, all 4 came out at once) don't come here starving/hungry. it's more of a tasting experience than a IMA GET MY BELLY sooooo FULL experience. as for the price, it wasn't as bad as i thought. came to about $50 per person. no alcohol or beverages. and i got to try all the dishes i was interested in.
