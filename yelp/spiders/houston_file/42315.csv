Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had higher expectations for a place that wants to call themselves the "best in America". First off their croissant was beautiful but was amazingly dry! Where's the butter? As someone who has traveled to France so often I know what that's suppose to taste like. Their baguette and brioche were probably the only thing I enjoyed. The macarons were both mixed feeling. The macaron cookie was tender but way too sugary! The filling were too sugary and didn't taste like they should. Vanilla tasted like artificial vanilla, Pistachio didn't taste like pistachio ( I actually had to spit it out), Lemon one tasted as though they just poured extract in it, and the caramel salted one left me hanging.
