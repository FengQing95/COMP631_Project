JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen is the Jinya Black tonkotsu. You can choose your level of mild, spicy, or hot. Portion is good. I like the thin ramen noodles they use with a whole egg. Broth is always creamy and flavored just right. I chose spicy and it was a good amount of spiciness. Their hot level isn't too spicy either.
