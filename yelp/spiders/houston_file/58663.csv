Baby Barnaby's////Once you're seated, the service is prompt and warm, and for all the huddled masses yearning for your table, you'll never feel rushed. Baby Barnaby's offers a pretty nice range of breakfast items from healthy to hangover cure. On my last visit, I decided to try the Green Eggs (eggs scrambled with spinach, jack cheese, and artichoke hearts) after hearing them talked up quite a bit. These eggs transcend the sum of their parts for a totally unique taste that's surprisingly addictive. The sides are also great- potatoes are crispy and savory, not blah like most breakfast potato sides. I'm a huge fan of the chicken/apple sausage, and usually sub toast for a tortilla so I can roll my own "tacos".
