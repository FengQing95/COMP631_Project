Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////2) SHRIMP AND GRITS - being from LA, I cannot avoid the buttery goodness of shrimp and grits and I have to admit, Common Bond does this dish justice. There are generous portions of shrimp (albeit small) along with cheese grits, creole sauce, cherry tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon, and herb salad.
