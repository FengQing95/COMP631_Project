Kata Robata////I was so excited to check this place out after hearing great things about it, so I made reservations in case there was a long wait. My friend & I arrived 10 minutes late but the hostess was understanding & sat us right away. It wasn't crowded at all for a Wednesday night, but it sure was chilly. So perhaps bring a light sweater :)
