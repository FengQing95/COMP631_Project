The Pit Room////Came in after we saw the great yelp reviews. And not disappointed. I ordered the 2 meat plate, brisket and venison sausage. I was not disappointed, the brisket was super tender and had a great Texas BBQ flavor. For sides I had potato salad which had all the right all the right add ins that gave it a rounded flavor. The coleslaw had a great seasoned flavor which was great.
