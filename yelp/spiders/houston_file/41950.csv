Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Where to start, I had a scone that was as hard as a rock, a parfait that was very bitter and the granola tasted like flower!!!  When our coffee came out it was not even hot!   Not worth the $25 I spent on a subpar breakfast.   All I can say positively is that the restaurant is beautiful and they have nice napkins!
