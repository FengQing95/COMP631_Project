Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The one thing we all agreed on was how perfect this cookie looks. 5/5, no doubt. It's so beautiful, it brings tears to my eyes. Like you have to brace yourself, because you're not ready for this deliciousness. It may not have taken the crown, but it holds a special place in my heart.
