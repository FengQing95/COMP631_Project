Kata Robata////I am so disappointed at this restaurant. Last week I came with my girlfriend for dinner. They told me at the reception that I had 1 1/2 hour for dinner. I thought it might be ok. We had cocktails, main meal and we ordered dessert. We literally took a bite of our dessert when someone from the restaurant came to tell us that we needed to leave now. I was appalled how rude this person was, I get it they needed the table but they can see clearly we just got our dessert. Also, there were a LOT of empty tables around the restaurant. I said I will leave when I finish my food. They kept passing by repeatedly looking at us. Horrible experience. Never again
