The Pit Room////Thanks Michael for your comments. To be fair to anyone reading this - I'm not suggesting don't go to the pit room. Go there !! I hope you have a better experience that what I did. I went there because of yelp reviews. I think the night I went was an exception. Honestly there was no taste and it felt like no salt was used. The next time I'm in Houston I'll return and if I'm impressed I'll let you know - just last time I went there I wasn't.
