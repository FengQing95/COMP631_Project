Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went on a Sunday at 6 pm.  Needed a little snack and beverage.  My partner tried the bosscat drink $14 which was actually very good.  Likely the highlight of the visit.  The restaurant is really more focused I think on beverages than food even though they have a menu of drinks and food.  We tried the $10 pulled pork hushpuppies (an order comes with 5) and this came with a mustard dipping sauce.  It was probably the best of the appetizers.  The outside was crispy and the inside was filled with pulled pork and was hot.  We also tried the fried meatloaf squares $10 for 4 squares.  This dish was unfortunately not as good.  The meatloaf it self was very bland although the outside did have a crisp texture...the dipping sauce helped bring a bit more flavor to it but I wouldn't bother reordering this if I went back next time.  While the corn hush puppies were worth a reorder.  I also tried the $6 cornbread madeleines (5 to an order) and this was probably the biggest disappointment.  We were cautioned to mix the huckleberry butter with sea salt but the butter was cold and not whipped or room temp so it made it very difficult to mix.  This may have been something we could adapt if the madeleines were warm but they were cold so the cold butter on top of the cold madeleine was not very appealing.  This appetizer would have been better warm and if the butter was not chilled but room temp so that you could spread things.This was a solid restaurant...not a wow factor of 5 or an above average repeat of 4 stars...but a decent enough place to go.
