Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////* Drinks were such a disappointment. We ordered spiced chai and hot chocolate. Spiced chai? was too milky, couldn't taste the masala or spice. When asked about the hot chocolate, they described as very rich chocolatey flavor and not as sweet.The drink was delivered in a coffee mug with mostly foam.
