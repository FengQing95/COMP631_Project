Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Despite the coffee being "eh", the pastries and breakfast sandwich are BY FAR best breakfast meal I have ever had. In fact, breakfast for two cost us around $40 (definitely $$) but so absolutely worth it. Nothing in the sandwich is food service. They bake the bun, they cook the egg there, they ground and grill the sausage on site, too. The herb and spices they mash into the meat are on point. Just thinking about it...makes me want to go back immediately!
