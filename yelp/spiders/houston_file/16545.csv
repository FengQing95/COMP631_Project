JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wait Staff (2/5): The hostess on this night was an All Star! She was super nice to everyone that was waiting and to the people with pickup orders. She kept homeless beggars away from us, and stopped some tow truck from towing some vehicles that to go orders. She was flying everywhere and had a fun attitude about everything. She made the difference between the two vs three star.
