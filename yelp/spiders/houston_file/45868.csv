Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////overall, i can see why this place has a great reputation. would i come back here? maybe for a brunch with friends, but it would not be my first choice. do i recommend it to others? yes, if you're looking for a restaurant with a nice environment with outdoor seating plus some decent food.
