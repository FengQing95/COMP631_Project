JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was disappointed with my ramen. I had the pork broth black, the broth flavor was lacking. My brother had the Brussel sprout ramen and it was definitely better. I would consider trying other ramen restaurants before I came back, but this place is very popular, so give it a shot.
