Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So my love affair with Common Bond is like some Shakespearean-level tragedy - it opened like a month before I moved to Philadelphia, and so I was only able to go a few times before fate tore us apart forever. Luckily for my poor, abandoned stomach, Â I'm back in town for a few weeks, and so stopped back in first chance I got for a little more romance.
