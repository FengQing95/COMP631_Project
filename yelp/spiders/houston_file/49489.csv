Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As for the flight, we ordered the sweet potato, pineapple upside down, and lemon poppyseed. While all nice concepts, execution was poor. The sweet potato just had some sweet potato shredded in more for aesthetic than taste. The 'sweet potato' part of it was the flavor--cinammon, maple syrup and butter. More sweet potato in the batter would have been appreciated. The pineapple wasn't bad, though our pancake had the pineapple mostly just concentrated in the center on top of the pancake rather than in the pancake itself. The poppyseed portion of the lemon popp7yseed was a joke, the poppyseeds were few and far between in the pancake--a mere sprinkle that didn't contribute the crunch associated with standard lemon poppyseed items.
