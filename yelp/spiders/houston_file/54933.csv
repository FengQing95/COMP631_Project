Kata Robata//// I ordered a salmon roll and the $18 oxtail Ramen.  We sat and looked at the menu while we waited so obviously I knew that the prices were on the high inside. Which is fine if the quality matched the price. My friend  and I fished  around the soup trying to find oxtail and there was virtually NO oxtaill in my Ramen. They should have described it as having flecks of oxtail. Considering the soup is mostly noodles $18 is WAY too expensive for this dish. I was expecting to have at least 2 whole oxtails in my bowl. I said something to the girl who brought my food out thinking that maybe they just forgot to put it in and she says she would ask but she never returned. I then waited for my server, who barely checked on us until it was time to go,  And his response was that the soup was supposed to have more of an "oxtail flavor" than actual oxtail and that everything on the menu was expensive.  Not the response I  would expect from this grade of restaurant. They do realize that ramen is like .25 an ounce right?  Needless to say based solely off of the soup and the way the server handled my complaints,  neither me nor my guest will be returning to this establishment.
