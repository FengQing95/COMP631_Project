Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The Establishment this super cute with a rustic modern feel! The staff took it to a whole other level. I had the spicy shrimp and grits, the red sauce did not disappoint. Appropriate size portions and not huge fillings where you have to order a to go box. James our waiter gave a great recommendation on the wine selection. I know crazy I would order wine at a whiskey bar but whiskey makes me emotional. LOL The whiskey room has so many selections from floor to ceiling. I'm sure it would be overwhelming to a whiskey aficionado. If you do go request Henry, what a warm welcoming gentleman. He made the visit so pleasant but most importantly fun (He was the reason I gave it a 5 star review. Customer service is a dying art). I can't wait to come back in the fall when the garage doors can allow for a gentle midnight breeze. Overall my experience here meets all my requirements. Relaxing, great energy, tasteful food, helpful waitstaff, clean, several menu choices for everyone and atmosphere.
