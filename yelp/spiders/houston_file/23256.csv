Uchi////The best sushi restaurant in the world. Well at least American what I mean America I include Hawaii. The 72 hours short rib beef is to die for. Rolls are amazing. Yellow tail is impeccably served. I can't read more about this place then anyone else have. It truly has thousands of reviews but I just need to add in mind. You won't be disappointed. Everything is so fresh. The service is amazing. People are nice. They do a good job of staffing. Valet is reasonable. It's busy but what isn't that is this good. Even after years of being here and going doesn't stop.
