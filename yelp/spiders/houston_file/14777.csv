JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Victoria - Thanks for the great review. I'm glad you and your meetup group decided on JINYA. I do regret that large(r) parties can get delayed during peak dining hours. But for future reference, we are opening two more locations in Katy and Willowbrook (FM1960), so hopefully that might help in terms of proximity.
