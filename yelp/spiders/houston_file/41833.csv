Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We're looking after a friend whose had open heart surgery earlier this week and he had a special request for Common Bond bread in the hospital as part of his recovery. My wife went out of her way to go to Common Bond today, but was met with shocking service. Since we can't bring knives or cut bread at the hospital, she kindly asked the staff to slice the bread for her. They rejected her twice before she went to see the Chef in the back. He rejected her request as well, even when she asked them to cut only 2-3 slices. They said it would hurt the integrity of Common Bond's products. "This is not how we sell our bread." Needless to say, we will not be returning to this store. If I was the owner, I would take a close look at the customer service levels and do an overhaul of the staff.
