Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////the breakfast sandwich left me knowing I would crave another one for weeks. The ambiance is interesting. It's definitely not somewhere you go to relax and grab a coffee. Unless you are there for the baked goods there is not much of a reason to go. The baked goods are delicious I just figured it would be more accommodating as a cafe like setting than it was. the tables are community style or bar. The right side of the bar however is so small all you could possibly fit on the ledge is your coffee. I went around 11:00 Â hoping to get some work done while enjoying breakfast and when I asked abut the internet they replied sometimes they don't turn it on until 2:00. I think that is a huge problem. I don't want to go to any establishment unless it's a dinner venue that I can't easily use my laptop or tablet.
