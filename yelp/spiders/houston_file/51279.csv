Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////1. Pancake flight- lemon ricotta poppy seed, pineapple upside down cake, and daddy's toolbox (special of the day). THESE PANCAKES ARE TO DIE FOR. Never really got that expression but it fits for these hotcakes. Like seriously. Soooo flipping good. The lemon was my favorite but my toddler scarfed down the savory sausage/chive daddy's toolbox special. Would return just to eat these pancakes. Already thinking about returning for these pancakes.
