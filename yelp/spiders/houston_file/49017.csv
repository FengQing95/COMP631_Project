Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First off, the wait is long...like 30-45 min long on a Friday morning (10ish) but they have a great system of texting you when your table is almost ready then when it's actually ready.  So basically this allows you to run some other errands in the surrounding area, the wifey and I went to go early vote, and have a good idea of when to return for your table.  If you don't want to run errands you can enjoy some of their fair trade coffee or a good game of corn hole.  The coffee alone is enough to wait around because it really is a good cup of joe!
