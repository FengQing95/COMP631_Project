JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pork Chatsu (4/5) - also very good.  It is marinated pork with spinach over rice.  This is definitely the dish that is much, much better at the clear lake location but it's not bad here either.  This is my favorite of all the combo's.  So if you wanna have something other than ramen this is a great choice as well.
