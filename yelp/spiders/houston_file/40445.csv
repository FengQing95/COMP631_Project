Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in and got a table of four. Ordered some happy hour items. Very tasty & drinks were good. Had a 5th friend show up, and they refused to pull a chair up to the table despite there being several tables open and chairs unused. Our 5th guest stood until we left. They asked if we could move to the 6 top. The staff said no. Soon after, seated 3 people at the 6 top. We were very displeased.
