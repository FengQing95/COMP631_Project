Local Foods////Wow! I just had the best gazpacho in my life. A soup like this would convert even those who believe they wouldn't like cold soup. It's watermelon Â and it was refreshing and filling. The Gulf shrimp and crab sandwich on ciabatta bread was excellent as well. A wonderful restaurant for an economical meal.
