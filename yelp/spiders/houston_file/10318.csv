JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tonkotsu Black - I ordered this for myself since this was considered their #1 ramen. It's a little on the salty side but there is soo much flavor!! The broth was wasn't too thick and it came with thin noodles. The pork chasu and the seasoned egg was the perfect touch for this. I also like spicy so I ended up putting in two scoops of the spicy sauce that they have on the table.
