Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place, breakfast is excellent. Loved the pancakes with chocolate chips they were trust delicious every single bite I gave was to die for this pancakes. Also the area is clean. Staff is really friendly and I have a great experience evrytime i come here. This was my 4th time and will come back again.
