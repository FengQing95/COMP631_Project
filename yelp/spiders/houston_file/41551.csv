Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The speediness of service could use some work. The wait bottlenecks at the ordering. Most customers know their order when they get to the front, but it's not always clear who is taking the order as there are several staff members behind the counter doing various tasks. The same person who takes the order will also put your pastry order on a plate, adding to the delay. The areas around the registers and counter are always crowded, adding to the illusion of a long wait. The food runners are exceptional though. They are very vigilant about clearing dishes and getting things for customers. Â
