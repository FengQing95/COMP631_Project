Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Cute pastry place that's obviously filling some dire need for baked goods in Montrose. It was freaking packed when we arrived at 10:30 on Saturday and although there's an ample parking lot, for some reason it's filled with giant refrigerators and two dumpsters. So commenced the Montrose parking battle.
