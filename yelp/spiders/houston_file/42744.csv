Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Enter the 2-stars:  the cookie "delivery" was made by someone that was clearly the owner, or at least some sort of hands-on manager.  That same person was hosting and chatting it up with 2 ladies that were seated directly behind me, at the large bar that is in the middle of the bakery.  Employees would approach him with varying concerns and he directed them accordingly.  He stood while the ladies, that sorta resembled him, sat.  As I quickly peered at him, I then noticed the open sore/wound that was on his elbow...While I don't think he kneeds bread with his elbow, such was still uncomfortable and created a bit of a concern for sanitary conditions.  I toiled between mentioning it, but I pride myself on being an honest Yelper.
