JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////hold the seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion served with THIN noodles. I added corn and spicy spice. I was blown away by the tremendous amount of flavor! Nothing like the high blood pressure packaged stuff in your local grocery. I can't wait to try this again. Happy birthday to me!
