Uchi//// We had a variety of sushi and the Jar Jar Duck. All the flavors blew my mind. The Jar Jar Duck was delicious, the foie gras sushi was super indulgent. The Machi Cure was one of my favorites. There was a Wyagu beef sushi, which I'm usually not a fan of beef, but it was mind blowing. We got the lemon gelato and fried milk for dessert which were both delicious, though I preferred the fried milk
