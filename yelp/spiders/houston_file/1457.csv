JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: Appetizer: I recommend the JINYA Bun - $3.95. It has tender pork slice (some fat), cucumber, and sauce in a white doughy bread, this dish is more Chinese than it is Japanese, but very delicious. Unfortunately, the first time I order this, the bun was a little soggy, it must have been sitting out for some time before they served it to me. However, the second time I had this dish, it was perfect. I've also had the Brussel Sprouts Tempura - $5.95. It is different because most tempura dishes come with a variety of vegetables (mushrooms, potato, carrots, etc). So, this is the first time I've had tempura brussel sprouts. I like the concept, but it was a little too greasy for me. I probably wouldn't order this again if I return. Entree: I stick to what I like and that is Tonkotsu Assari - $9.95. This includes pork, kikurage (Japanese mushrooms), green onion, seasoned eggs, spicy bean sprouts, and is served with thick noodles (can switch out for thin noodles). For this dish, I like to add nori dried seaweed and corn. Dessert: There's no big surprise here, they serve mochi - $2.95 (green tea and chocolate). They're definitely good, but nothing special (especially cause you know it was store bought).
