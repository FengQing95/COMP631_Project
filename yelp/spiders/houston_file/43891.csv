Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The second item we had was the chocolate croissant. Somehow, the top of this croissant is different, and delicious too, but in a different way. It's shiny and crispy almost like they a thin crispy skin. Inside, is a filling of luxurious bittersweet chocolate. This croissant is less airy than the plain, but it's because of the chocolate.
