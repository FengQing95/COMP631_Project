The Pit Room////I really wanted to give a better review but I cannot tell a lie. The staff are very friendly which is why I came a second time but to my horror I was charged almost $14 for a brisket sandwich and a drink. What am I missing here? I'm not a bbq expert, the food was just ok. $14 seems a bit outrageous for what I ordered. The first time I came I ordered the same items but did not pay that's why I was so surprised at the total on my second visit. I don't think I'll return, I just can't reason paying that much for a sandwich and tea.
