Kata Robata////The first time I had the mac and cheese I did not like it! I told my boyfriend, "this tastes alright, nothing special" and I honestly didn't see all the hype, why it was "so good." so I let him eat that, but the second time we ordered it, which was yesterday, it actually tasted different! I initially didn't want to order it again, but my boyfriend loves it, so why am I to hold him back from his food-love? Â I'm so glad he ordered it again, because I can say I was STUFFED from the ramen, and the mac and cheese made me wanna keep eating. The first time I felt the mac and cheese was ordinary, it actually had a bitter taste to me at first, and yesterday it redeemed itself.
