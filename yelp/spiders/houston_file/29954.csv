The Pit Room////Best Brisket BBQ in town. It's got the best bark flavoring that has just right texture. I love marbled brisket. Moist and tender. Doesn't need bbq sauce due to the bark flavoring. Beef sausage is good, I've also had their jalape√±o sausage and I can never decide on which I like more. I personally don't like the venison sausage (I don't like the game taste - I don't like lamb for the same reason but that's just me).
