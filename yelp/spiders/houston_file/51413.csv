Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We decided to try one of the most reviewed places for breakfast. The waitlist was almost an hour, but we didn't mind that. The host and waitress were very polite. And the food was delicious, however we ordered a chai and it came after the food was delivered to us. Other than that everyone was amazing, the interior design, the cleanliness, and the location of the restaurant. Will be back!!
