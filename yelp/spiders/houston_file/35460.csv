Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Literally everything is amazing!!! The old fashioned was the BEST I had, it was strong, but also balanced. I got the barbecue porchetta burger and the whiskey okra which I loved! The atmosphere is fantastic and we had the best server, Terry, who was very knowledgeable and very catering. I highly recommend! Definitely coming back here next month for a birthday.
