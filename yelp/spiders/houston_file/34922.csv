Local Foods////Although I have ups and downs through my reviews with Local Foods, I still keep coming back because I don't have to worry about guessing what's in their ingredients or how it's prepared. Â If you're on the whole30 program, some of their items on the menu is whole30 approved. They don't use any sauces or sugar in their meat preparation.
