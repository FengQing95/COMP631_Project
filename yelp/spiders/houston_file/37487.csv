Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First let me start off saying that the service is non existent. While our server wasn't rude, most of the times he disappeared for minutes at a time, leaving my group breaking necks looking around and thirsty. What brought us in was their selection of whiskey and the sleek design of the place but what's not taking me back was the diabetes on my plate. We went Sunday morning for the $32 brunch-unlimited mimosas. Which was all orange juice, and splash of champagne. Couple of my friends got a burger as part of this deal. But they only got a burger on a plate. No fries no condiments. Nada. The French toast I ordered was beautiful with layers of syrup and a sprinkle of fruity pebbles on top. Two bites and my sugar rush kicked in. Won't try this place again:(
