Uchi////I came here for dinner with the boyfriend and the best friend on a Tuesday.  And because I am a spazz, I kept obsessing about the possibility of waiting forever and a year despite our confirmed 9:15 reservations (as per other reviewers' experiences).  As I sipped on my wine in the bar area, I nervously stared down the hostess area a few yards away for acknowledgement. Fortunately, my anxieties were unfounded and we were seated within a reasonable amount of time.  Hurray!
