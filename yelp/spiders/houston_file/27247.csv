The Pit Room////Best Smoked meat I've ever had. Hands down. As a native Texan and former General Manager of a high volume BBQ restaurant I can honestly say I've never enjoyed smoked meats and accoutrements so much. It's very rare to find an eatery in this genre that puts such emphasis on the art of homemade everything. The variety of pickled everything was amazing. From the pickles to the carrots and all the while the glistening brisket on your tray keeps calling to you. Â
