JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've tried Tiger Den and Kubos, but those places are like standard definition compared to the 1080P of JINYA! We started out with the takoyaki appetizer. I see it in animes all the time so I decided to see what the hype was about. It was basically a fried ball with a little piece of octopus inside. It was good, but not so good that I would order it again. I don't think it's because of the way they made it, just personal prefence/pallet. I got the spicy No. 1 ramen and it was so delicious. The yolk of the egg was gooey, the seaweed was a great complement, the noodles were excellently cooked and the pork was so tender that all I had to do was grab a corner with my chopstick and a perfect, bite-sized chunk would rip off. Most importantly, the broth was SO FLAVORFUL. I loved it. Usually I crave pho when I want a hot soup but this place is going to give me ramen cravings. My favorite ramen spot in Houston :) My only complaint would be the noise level. The music was a bit loud, causing everyone to have to yell to hear each other, causing everyone to try to yell above the other table's yelling, etc.
