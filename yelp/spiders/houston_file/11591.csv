JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////THEY HAVE SHELLFISH IN ALL THEIR BROTHS FOR THE RAMENS! My friend is having an allergic reaction and I called to see if it's possible that they could've been Â cross contamination between something and shrimp which they just added to their menu, and the worker in the phone told me all their broths contain shellfish. BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY BECAUSE THEY DON'T SAY IT ANYWHERE ON THE MENU!!
