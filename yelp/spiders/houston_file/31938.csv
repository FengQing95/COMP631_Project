Local Foods////My husband chose to eat outside as the October day was the first break in the usual Houston heat & humidity. Â There is a modest, but not tiny, outside eating area with about 4-6 tables and a bar styled counter with barstools around the perimeter of the outdoor eating area. I really appreciated the uncommon and sturdy white solid surface (think Corian, silestone): smooth and easy to clean thoroughly. This counter is so much better than the usual counters made of wood that warps, gets uneven and is hard to clean well.
