The Pit Room////I'm definitely the outlier in this population, but it's barbecue. Lol the atmosphere is great. The staff are cordial. It's a clean environment and the country music really helps to create the right ambiance. Ordering food is easy and the food is "well" cooked. I only put parentheses because "well" is relative. For me, I had the brisket and chicken tacos. The chicken taco was extremely salty which kind of made it an uncomfortable experience. The sauce for the brisket was also pretty salty too. The Mac and cheese was super cheeeeeeeesy lol, but tasted great, the green beans and cole slaw were also great. I think if you're looking for great barbecue, this is a good place to stop by. But, barbecue can be really salty, so, just keep that in kind.
