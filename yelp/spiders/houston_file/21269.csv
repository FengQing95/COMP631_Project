Uchi////The freshest sushimi in town, professional & knowledgeable staff, & way more than your commonly known fish--these chef's are mindful in what they plate... and the atmosphere is second to none! These is a great place if you're looking for romantic change of pace, uptown feel without being snobbish, or local/small scale feel that only Montrose in the inner loop can provide. Worth the money & trip to experience a one-of-a-kind gem!
