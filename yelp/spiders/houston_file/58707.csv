Baby Barnaby's////I am honestly writing this as I sit here in this amazing restaurant.  I walked in and was a little disoriented at first because one wall has mirrors that makes the place look bigger.  But man yelp has come through again with great places!  The place was nice and cozy.  And they have some seats outside that can be used when the weather is warmer.  The choices are s little small compared to big chains like IHOP but it's that way for a reason.  They can concentrate on great food.  I ordered the green eggs which had artichoke and spinach with a cream sauce.  I hate runny and mooshy eggs but Omg was this the best scrambled eggs I have ever had.  I had hot tea as the drink.  And they had my favorite tea brand, twinnings! So this place was in my good list before the food even came out.
