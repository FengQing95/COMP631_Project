JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But please allow me to put the situation you witnessed in some context, as well. In the three years we have been open, there have been several occasions when (presumably) homeless individuals have entered our restaurant and ordered food, both to dine in and also to-go. These individuals paid for their meals in full and left the premises sans problems. On other occasions, we have had (again, presumably) homeless individuals approach the bar or host stand and simply ask us for food -- not money. On the albeit rare occasions this has happened, we have given these individuals a meal for free.
