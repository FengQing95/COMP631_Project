Uchi////We ordered a nice bottle of wine, a few appetizers, rolls and sashimi. Our waiter made a few suggestions which we ordered most of them and they were all fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend isn't a huge sushi so he prefers rolls over sashimi. This is not the best place for him since they do not have very many rolls on their menu.
