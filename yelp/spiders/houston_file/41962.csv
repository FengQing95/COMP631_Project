Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I drove 30 mins away with my husband and children to try this amazing cafe based on the reviews. Sorry to say I was not impressed. Parking is limited. We got the strawberry shortcake, turtle brownie and a few macaron's. The shortcake had no flavor. The turtle brownie was extremely rich and not tasty also extremely tough to eat with a spoon. My children did not want to eat anything but the macaron. The strawberry macaron was delicious. The chocolate one was okay. The price is high each dessert was around $6 (macaron $2.50) and the case they are in has no back so flies were in there. Yuck. Although the desserts look beautiful they are lacking in taste. I will not be returning.
