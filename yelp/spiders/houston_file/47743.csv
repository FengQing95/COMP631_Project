Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is very close for me and clearly a popular newish place, and while the décor and the food is pretty good I have never been impressed with the service. At  7am on a quite cold Friday morning I would not expect to see people standing around chatting while I am sitting there without coffee, clearing plates before looking after people who have been sitting for 5 minutes.
