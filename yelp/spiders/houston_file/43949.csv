Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If I must sum them up in one word it would have to be spectacular.  The prices for the baked goods are comparable to other little shops, one in particular in the Rice Village, but on a MUCH larger scale!  Check them out if you can; your taste buds will thank you!
