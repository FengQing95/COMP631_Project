Uchi////So much to say I don't even know where to begin. Customer service 10/10 ALWAYS. Cassandra is an amazing hostess first and foremost, I felt genuinely taken care of by her the entire time, she also had AMAZING suggestions in terms of the menu. Chef Daniel Sun was also amazing and very informative. Uchi, thank you for an excellent time and incredible experience.
