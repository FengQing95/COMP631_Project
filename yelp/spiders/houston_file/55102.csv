Kata Robata////Must tries are the following: miso lobster mac and cheese, toro of the season's tuna, hamachi kama, hamachi with quail egg, wagyu A5 sushi, bone marrow, scallop with foie gras, and their scallops. Some of these items every one has, but the quality is just not there. So go ahead, and spend that money.
