Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's pretty good, but I'm not sure I really get all the hype. Went there on Sunday morning - which I knew was a bad idea, but wanted to get there before everything sells out. The line was already about ten people long. On the outside of the building... Took about an hour to order and receive food. Bought a fairly large selection of stuff, as I don't plan on standing in that line very frequently. Everything was good, so no complaints. Prices were.. Enough, but not expensive.
