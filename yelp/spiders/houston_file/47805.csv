Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now back to me being carded. So this chick (in a super cute Jean dress) stands next to me and orders drinks (alcoholic ones) from MARIAH, and she has her ID in her hand about to hand it over when MARIAH waves her off like it's all good. Now I'm like HOL'up. Me and this girl clearly look around the same age but she doesn't get carded. Â so I'm talking about it to my friend. He was like maybe she's a regular, but it was obvious she wasn't from their interaction. Again, she's standing RIGHT NEXT TO ME. So this other chick comes up who clearly looks 21 or younger and she gets carded and I bring it up like, that's strange. So MARIAH over hears this and is like is there a problem? I said I'm just confused why there is selective carding. Then this chick proceeds to lie in my face and say "oh I grabbed her ID and said it was good" now in my head I'm like "bish you really want to tell that bold face lie" but I hit her "um no I sat here and watch you wave her ID away without looking at it. Then this clown decides to get her manager involved which is fine with me.
