Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over easy, and a side pretzel bun. Why? Because pretzel bun. The hash was in a word, bland. I could only taste the onions and the poblanos that way overpowered the meat. The pretzel bun was definitely a pretzel, but unsalted pretzels are slightly less than useless.
