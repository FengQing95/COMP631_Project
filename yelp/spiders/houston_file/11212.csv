JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is pretty small inside and there's usually a wait. However, if there are just 2 of you the wait is minimal (15-20 mins) because they're very efficient. Once sat down, a waiter comes quickly for drinks and after you've ordered food it's not much more than another 15 minutes for hot deliciousness to arrive!
