Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we sat our server was super nice and explained the pancake of the day to us. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake Â "ahh la carte". The food was definitely worth the wait! The corned beef hash was filling and was really good, not too salty as many corned beef hashes tend to be. The pineapple upside down pancake was definitely my FAVORITE! It's like dessert for breakfast and I saved the best for last.
