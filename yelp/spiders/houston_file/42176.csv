Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here 2x so far, and I am already looking forward to coming back.  There are many great baked options.  Coffee is a must, as the pastries are on the buttery side.  Seating is hard to come by, so plan to come early in the morning for best seating.  They offer plenty of parking, which is really nice in this motor-city.
