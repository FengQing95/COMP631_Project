Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you could imagine a french pastry shop in Disneyland/Disneyworld, this would be the place. You're waiting in line and the experience is short but you'll love pretty much everything you're doing and eating during the time you're there, but the servers might be the ones who ruin the experience. Skip the macarons, focus on the pastries (buttery goodness that sticks to your lips), and the pain perdu is apparently good, but make sure you share otherwise you'll be hibernating for the rest of the day.
