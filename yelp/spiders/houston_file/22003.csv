Uchi////Hands down this is one of the best restaurants in town. Every single time I eat here, they do not disappoint. The food is so unique and exquisite, and the service is always phenomenal. This round we had the Walu Walu, Hama Chili, Brussel Sprouts and Wagyu Nigari which are classic musts. We also tried Â  the Sakana Mushi for the first time and the kind of flavor they produced in one bowl was amazing. Ended the night with the fried milk (so unique and so delicious) alongside the blueberry taro which was just as good!
