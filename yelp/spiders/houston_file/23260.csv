Uchi////The positive: free valet parking in the back; hip decor & nice ambiance; attentive service. Our waiter was very patient and explained everything on the menu for us. We appreciated when each plate was delivered, another explanation of what was being served and how it was cooked were given. As soon as we finished a plate, it was immediately removed by one of the staff. On the flip side, that kind of made us feel like we were being constantly watched by their army of servers, always standing attentively nearby, and frankly, rushed. But we didn't mind it as much as the other negatives.
