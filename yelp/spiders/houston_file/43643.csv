Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So I have been here a lot for bakery and coffee items which are wonderful. Today I ordered their chef scramble and it was terrible. First I asked for no cheese and the dish came covered in cheese. The scramble had no real veggies in it just some potatoes and spices and I think maybe sausage which was chewy at times and not what I expected at all. There was nothing fresh about it. The potato hash was a deep fried brick of potato and cheese so that was a waste. I asked for a side salad which was heavenly dressed. I really just disappointed and surprised. Will not be ordering brunch here again.
