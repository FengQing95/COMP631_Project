The Pit Room////I was actually hungry and I ordered brisket taco with okra as side. I specifically mentioned I want the brisket to be sliced not chopped. And guess what, they are really dry, really really dry... I am not sure if I ordered just as default (chopped brisket in tortilla with everything on top) would it taste better or not, but still, the tortilla is just fine. There's nothing to write home about. Of course it's not a real tex-mex place and I should not critique the quality of the tortilla. However, I am not a fan of their brisket either. Maybe I should have ordered beef ribs? Maybe I should come during a busier time? I don't know, but I just don't feel I went to a Top 50 BBQ of Texas.
