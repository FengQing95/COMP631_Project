Local Foods////I wasn't a huge fan. I went with a friend who goes all the time and loves it. The food was unique and it was ok but nothing spectacular. I am a little bit of a pickey eater and it seemed great for someone who is very organic and health conscious but for someone not used to eating like that, the food seemed strange. It was in a very cute location and had fun bottled sodas.
