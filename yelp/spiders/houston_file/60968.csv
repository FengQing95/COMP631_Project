Baby Barnaby's////This place is amazing! I came here for a girls brunch and had to wait awhile to be seated and our waiter was slow but probably due to being so busy which is my reason for 4stars. I got the Green eggs and wanted to substitute the artichokes for tomatoes but then I learned it's all pre made. The waiter told me to trust him and still get it bc I wouldn't even know they were there. Oh boy was he right! The eggs were so creamy and good! I couldn't taste the spinach in there either. The sweet potatoes & chicken Apple sausage sides it comes with are yummy as well. I substituted my toast for fruit for an extra charge.
