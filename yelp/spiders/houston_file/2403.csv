JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tram - Thanks for your review. Our pork soboro is one of our most popular side dishes, but like so many other aspects of our menu, it's never going to be all things to all people. We appreciate your feedback, and agree that the parking garage, which is currently undergoing massive renovation, isn't ideal, but it is free, which is not very common to find here in Midtown.
