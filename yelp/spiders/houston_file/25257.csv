Uchi////The worst dining experience in 5 years. DO NOT EAT HERE GO TO MF SUSHI INSTEAD! The portions are bizarrely tiny even for me with a small appetite. The cost was about Â $100 pp and only 1 person in our group of 5 commented they "thought" they weren't "still hungry." The food quality and taste were marginal at best. My order took 1.5 hours and 5+ requests to be served. When the sushi roll finally made it to the table it was so tiny it could not have weighed more that 3 to 4 ounces. I had to go home and eat. Also, when we arrived for our reservation they took us to a cold patio and tried no less than 5 times to take our dinner order and serve us there. Each time we declined. Over 30 minutes later we were given our reserved table. A few days later we went to MF Sushi and had an amazing meal with high quality fish in appropriate serving sizes, totally different and wonderful experience.
