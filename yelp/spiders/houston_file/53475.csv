Kata Robata////The two rolls we ordered: California Roll & Crazy Roll. The California roll was slightly better than the Crazy, but I've definitely had a lot better. And the seaweed paper used to roll the Crazy roll might have been my off point, or maybe it was the gross looking tuna inside of it - Whatever it was, I did not like it. Next time, I'd definitely order one of the specialty rolls.
