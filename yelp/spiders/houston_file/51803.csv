Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I give the food an A+, but the service only a C+. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich, with egg and sausage. I ordered the ginger pancakes. Both meals were very good, and the portions are huge. However the service was lacking. At one point I went to the bathroom and saw our waiter looking at his paycheck with another employee, and talking about their hours/pay. However our waters and my coffee had been empty for quite a while. We finally just grabbed another waiter to help us. I would visit again, as some other servers seemed more on top of things at their tables, and the food was amazing!
