Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Gorgeous petite desserts with unique ingredients. Regret not getting the Earl Grey and pear scone that spoke to me right as I entered. I got the trio and while beautiful, only the chocolate dessert was worth eating. Chai latte was barely discernable beneath the 90% coconut milk. Birthday cake macaron was delicious! Overpriced, but as with everything these days "hey trendy and cute- yay!"
