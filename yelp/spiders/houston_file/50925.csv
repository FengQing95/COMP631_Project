Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The inside is very clean and crisp. The menu is full of options! Very reasonable prices. Fast service! Which makes up for the wait. I order the pomegranate margarita, which was honestly one of the best margaritas I've had. I'd recommend this over the mimosas. I order a Blueberry Danish pancake and the Snooze Spud Deluxe, which is hash browns topped with cheese scallions and two extra toppings of your choice, I chose bacon and avocados. The pancake was very good, not too sweet, the blueberry and the lemon cream cheese filling blended very well. The spud deluxe was delicious! Filling, flavorful but not overwhelming. I tasted my date's French toast and that was just as good!
