JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So my co-worker invited me here but I was a bit hesitant because I was like really Ramen what is special about this? I really did not know what to expect but I LOVED IT! The egg is so delicious and the thick noodles OMG. I am a big fan of Â the Cha Cha Cha because I love garlic and I always go for the pork.
