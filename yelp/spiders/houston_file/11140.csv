JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachel - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your comments, though I think it's important I point out that we offer two more spice levels beyond "Hot," which are "Inferno" and "Double Inferno." These are "off-menu" modifications that were borne out of numerous customers' requests to make their broth spicier. I'm sorry we didn't meet your standards for ramen, which is completely fair, but I do appreciate your acknowledging our good service and ambience. But above all, I appreciate your giving us a try, and hopefully some of the folks you dined with thought differently!
