Uchi////Rounding out the meal, we had the zero sen maki roll, which was filled with yellowtail, avocado, shallot, and cilantro, and served with a miso sauce. Decent, but not particularly memorable. Finally, we had the most delicious dish of the meal: the kinoko nabe, which consisted of mushrooms, koshihikari (short grain) rice, Korean chili sauce, an egg yolk, and gyutoro (braised short rib) served in a stone pot (like dolsot bibimbap). The waiter mixed up the rice for us, and every bite tasted peppery and decadent. The short ribs were so tender, and they added an umami flavor that paired so well with the mushrooms. Amazing!!
