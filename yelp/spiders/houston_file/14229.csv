JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Service: The guy who was serving our party was pretty cool. He was quick to take orders from all of us (in the end, only nine people showed up) and there was no issues in splitting the check. The only downside was when the food was coming out, they were kind of messed up in delivering the right appetizers to the right person. However, all the ramen bowls were brought out to the right people.
