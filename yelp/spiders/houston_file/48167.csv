Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I cannot wait to return to Snooze. The food and atmosphere was amazing. The main complaint I have is wait time (an hour for first available) and that there isn't an area to sit while you wait. The entrance is really crowded since there isn't anywhere to sit. I heard some people say they went for a stroll and then came back, but I didn't want to risk missing Â my name being called. The staff was very friendly and patient with guests when they seemed to be getting irritated, a major plus. I also enjoyed seeing all the efforts they were making to stay green. Now, the food delicious. I got the Snooze Spuds Deluxe, just thinking about it is making my mouth water. I added sausage and jalapenos as my filling (you get two). The hash browns were a lot less greasy than I anticipated, making them crispy...soggy hash browns are never fun. The was just enough cheese for it to be cheese and not gooey. I got my eggs over hard and I mainly think that just adds to the presentation. I would have liked to have jalapenos that had more heat (and to have more of them), but chefs know best.
