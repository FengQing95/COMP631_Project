Local Foods////I've tried the Duck Confit sandwich, the Roast Beef sandiwch, and the Truffled Egg Salad. You cannot go wrong with anything they offer and don't be afraid to ask for samples. The staff is kind, the food is spectacular, and the place has integrity. You can't beat a combination like that... unless you're combining shrimp and crab I suppose. I'd throw my morals out the window for that sandwich...
