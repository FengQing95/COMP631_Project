JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is great. Aside from rarely having to wait to be seated and serving beer, the ramen is delicious. The spicy umami miso ramen, tonkotsu spicy, and Jinya tonkotsu black are awesome! Add a seasoned egg if it doesn't come with one already. And of course, add more pork!
