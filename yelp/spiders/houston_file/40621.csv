Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was VERY good. Everything we ordered was amazing. We got the chicken and sausage pasta, BBQ salmon, short ribs, picked veggies and OMG the fried apple pie. Chef Anthony even came out to talk to us what a great touch. Try this place you WILL NOT regret it! OH yeah the drinks and service was also on point!
