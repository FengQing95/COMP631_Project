Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Here on business and looking for something close but also with selection. BC (BossCat) was down the street and one of the "hot and new" on yelp, so we checked it out. Loved the atmosphere even from the outside! Large open windows and they opened the door for us as we approached. We are laid back people so we just took a seat at the bar. Matt was out bartender, greeted us and even shook our hands! Everything was delicious! Must have the pig candy!! *** Matt let us know they have only been open for 3 weeks. Even though yelp said "hot and new" they made it seem like they have been open for months, not weeks! Loved it and will recommend this place to anyone!
