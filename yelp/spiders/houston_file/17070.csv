JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Sara - Thank you very much for the stars. We greatly appreciate it. We're very puzzled how our Spicy Chicken Ramen could taste like fish since we carry no ingredients on our preparation line that might create that taste profile. Our only guess is that your husband might have added ramen seasoning to his bowl. The ramen seasoning does contains soy sauce, jalapenos and seaweed, which does taste of fish.
