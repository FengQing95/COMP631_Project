Local Foods////Shrimp & Crab Sandwich (5 stars): A well-crafted sandwich with a sizable amount of fresh, sweet-tasting shrimp and crab meat. Not only was the meat succulent, the bread was nicely toasted such that it wouldn't scrape the roof of your mouth but still provide that satisfying crunchy bite. Has a little bit of kick to it but it is balanced well by the creamy Green Goddess dressing.
