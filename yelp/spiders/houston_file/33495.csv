Local Foods////Market veggie sandwich: Great. I'm always surprised when an all-veggie sandwich can hold its own, and this one definitely can. The brussel sprouts and cauliflower contribute wonderful texture, and the pickled onions add just the right amount of acid. Hummus and avocado are the perfect creamy foil to a crusty ciabatta.
