Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The menu is hardly remarkable, but we were hoping the basic food listed on the menu might be incredible (according to reviews). We ordered IMMEDIATELY, as soon as the waitress took our drink orders - and we waited - and waited - and waited - and after another 45 minute wait, we had to go. We asked our flighty waitress about our food several times and were told each time that it was "coming".
