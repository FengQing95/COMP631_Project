Baby Barnaby's////Quality breakfast food! My favorite place to get breakfast. The first time I went here I tried the green eggs. Absolutely delicious! Most def a must try if you visit this restaurant. The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is very laid back and comfortable. The only negatives are the hours (closes at noon on weekdays) and the wait on busy days. The restaurant is small so they can only seat so many people at once. The food is worth the wait though! The line just proves that they have good food!
