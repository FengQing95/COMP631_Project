Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is walking distance within our neighborhood so I come here a lot to meet friends.  I have basically tried every item on the menu and bakery thus far, including their drinks.  It's a nice place to grab bites and gather, but I'm never completely impressed with the food.  There's always something slightly too audacious or too timid about the items on the menu.  Maybe because it is a rather "upscale" bakery, you're more tempted to assume that the execution should be on point.  For example, their coffees often taste weak yet slightly burnt, while the pastries are overly sized and sweet.  The ambiance is indeed nice, and the service is good.
