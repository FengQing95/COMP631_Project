Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Was a fan of Common Bond when they first opened but in recent years they've been on a steady decline. Some noticed the decline after Roy ShvartzapelÂ  went back to New York and Carrabba's took over but I marked the decline starting with them changing out the high quality napkins for cheaper ones.
