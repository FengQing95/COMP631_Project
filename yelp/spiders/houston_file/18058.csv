Uchi////I absolutely love Uchi! When you want a hot sushi date night, then this is the place. You can dress up and enjoy fine sushi dining at its best with your boo. Every time I come here I have to have the ham and egg rolls, Brussels sprouts and foi gras nigiri. Once you try these, you will be hooked!
