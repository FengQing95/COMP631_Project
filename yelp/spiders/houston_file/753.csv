JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your feedback. Pricing is never easy in the food industry. I'm forced to find balance between paying all the expenditures while also achieving a healthy profit for he business to grow. Midtown's rent isn't cheap. Our custom-made ramen bowls from Japan cost $25 each plus shipping. And let's not forget these bowls also break during the day-to-day process.
