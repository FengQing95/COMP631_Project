Local Foods////I love this place. I went two times in one weekend.   One location for lunch and the Kirby location to pickup a piece of that butterscotch brownie.  Oooooh so good.  I must say the Kirby location is more spacious, but both are very nice and great for people watching.  Considering bringing my friend here for lunch this Sunday.  I've had the Roasted Shortrib sandwich, which is soooo yummy.   And I had some of my daughter's Smoke Salmon sandwich, really good too.  I was quite impressed with the Vegan Potato Salad, but I'm not a fan of the Housemade Chips at all.  They were extremely bland.
