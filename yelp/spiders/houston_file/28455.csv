The Pit Room////You order at the counter and bring your food to your table of choice. They have a couple tables outside as well as a decent number of booths. The booths are pretty small so you're closer to your dining partner than you would expect. That's cool and all if you're on a date but a little awkward if you're on a bro date. Withstanding the awkwardness, we enjoyed our food. I got the brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. The brisket was sliced with a nice pepper bark to it and the buns were fresh. They give you a side of their homemade BBQ sauce served warm. The mac and cheese was a little soupy but delicious nonetheless.
