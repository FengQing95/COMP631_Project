Kata Robata////Scallops and Prosciutto: This appetizer was on their daily specialty menu. Our waiter suggested this one to us. I can't recall the exact name of the dish, but I know it had these two items in it. It was good. I got a little nervous at first, because my first bite was a little fishier than normal. However, as I kept eating I was reassured with a light and refreshing appetizer.
