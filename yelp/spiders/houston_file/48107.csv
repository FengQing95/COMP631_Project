Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Place has a nice ambience and feel to it. Wait wasn't too bad and service was okay. I ordered the french toast but it wasn't that great, definitely have had better. Presentation and pictures online made them seem delicious but did not meet my expectations. I'll probably give this place another go and order something different, hopefully my next dish will be better!
