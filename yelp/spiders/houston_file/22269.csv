Uchi////I attended one of the soft opening nights before Uchi opened to the public and had anticipated some bumps along the way, as it is a 'soft' opening, but their service and food was above that of most other seasoned restaurants on their best days. The interior is beautiful; it is so Japanese in its simplistic elegance.
