Kata Robata////Their menu has a large variety of items with very different flavors.   You can walk out of many sushi restaurants and feel like all the dishes you ordered tasted the same, but not at Kata Robata.  Every dish is carefully crafted and the flavors that present itself when you take a bite make that evident.  I'd take the time to describe some of the dishes I ate, but I'm a lazy Yelper.  Some notable dishes include the toro and short rib roll (very unique mesh of fatty flavors), U-10 pan seared scallops, salmon carpaccio (delish!), and the foie gras and scallop nigiri.  Everything I've eaten at Kata Robata was unique and enjoyable.
