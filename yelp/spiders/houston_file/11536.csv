JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My cousin and I both ordered the Cha Cha Cha (pork broth), but he usually gets the Tonkotsu Black. We also ordered the Pork Gyoza & Salad combo. The gyoza wasn't too bad, though a bit salty. The skin was moist and I like the pronounce taste of scallion. The salad was better than I expected because it was made of baby spring mix instead of head lettuce.
