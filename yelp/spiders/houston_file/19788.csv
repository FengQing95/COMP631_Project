Uchi////My friend and I decided earlier in the day that we were going to go downtown from The Woodlands to attend their Happy Hour. I lived downtown for a few years and have had sushi across Houston, and previous to that in other major Metropolitan areas. At the end of the day, I'm a foodie, but I've taken the time to appreciate and learn more about sushi by doing my research and asking questions.
