Local Foods////When I stepped in Local Foods for a Tuesday lunch, the atmosphere and design of the restaurant amazed me. The decor was modern, simple, and it felt so welcoming. Menu was simple as well, not like complicated ones that gives you 1000 options to choose from. Sandwich + 2 sides or cup of soup, easy. I went ahead and ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich with a cup of the chicken posole.
