The Pit Room////Amber wanted to check out Kusama exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, and I wanted to check out a new barbecue place so a trip to Houston was in store. I was doing research to see what was close to the MFA because we had to be there when they first open to get tickets. The Pit Room opened about two weeks ago. I have seen a lot of pictures on social media, and the food looked pretty good. Then I saw The Pit Room was less than a mile from the exhibit. Score.
