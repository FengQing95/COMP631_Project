JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen was wonderful! The noodles were perfectly cooked. I got the spicy tonkatsu ramen, with "spicy" as my heat. The only problem was that I didn't taste any spice at all. However, I come from a family madly in love with spicy foods so I may just be used to it. There is a spice jar on the table though so it was a quick fix.
