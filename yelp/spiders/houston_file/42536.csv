Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond croissant. The worst almond croissant I've had. I mean, it's really flaky and all but it was burnt! All I tasted was burnt croissant and it seemed as if they tried to cover the burnt top with powdered sugar and almonds! The bottom was also burnt. I don't understand how you can serve burnt bakery to your customers. For $4.50, I'll try a different place that doesn't sell burnt croissants to their customers.
