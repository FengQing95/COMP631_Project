JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Christina - Wow. What a great review. In our business, we're never going to please all the people all of the time -- and we'd be crazy to think we could. But every so often guests like yourself remind us why we work as hard as we do every single day. Thank you again for your supremely kind words. We can only hope to maintain the standards you have come to expect from us. Much appreciated, and we look forward to serving you again.
