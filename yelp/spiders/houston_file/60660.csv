Baby Barnaby's////Came here about 11 am Sunday morning after looking on Yelp for a good place to eat brunch. The line was super long but we decided to wait. When we went to put our name down the guy was very rude. The system they have with the clipboard is just not working. They need a little speaker to be put on the side of the building so the people sitting on the side walk can hear their names being called.
