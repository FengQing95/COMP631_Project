Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tried it because of the good ratings and the pictures of a LOT of whiskey. Crisia was awesome making sure we got the drinks (samples) and food we wanted. Beer selection = strong; cocktails = really creative; food = mamma will be disappointed you don't come home on Sunday anymore.
