Uchi////Had an amazing night at Uchi. The place was packed, but there was open seating at the wine bar. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about the menu items, even describing the preparation. I was impressed that they recommended a sequence of my sushi selections - light to rich flavor. I never felt like the service was pretentious. Instead it was like having dinner with people who really, really love and appreciate food. I had fun trying new textures and flavors. Highlights of the evening were hama chili, saba shio, and madai (sea breem). Save the foie nigiri for last. It's a memorable end to an amazing experience.
