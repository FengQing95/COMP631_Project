Uchi////To start, the quality of the food is phenomenal! My brother and I shared the 10 course meal and dish after dish was superb except at dish 4 and 8 (or something like that). His favorite was the scallops and mine was a curious dish with a carrot sauce. What made me terribly disappointed however was the rice that I received. I am Asian and have been raised on rice my entire life. I can say without a doubt that their rice was dry, and needed more water in the soaking and cooking process. Imagine, dry rice mixed with sushi vinegar... That's why I had and wanted the waiter to taste it. In the end, I just told the waiter and he gave us a new batch at the end of our 10 course meal. I have to say, that was a save and the reason for the 5-star review. Sushi restaurants have to make hundreds of batches of rice but if you're going to charge $100+ per person, you NEED to make sure every batch is impeccable. Nonetheless, every dish that came was to my liking in exception of the first 2 sushi dishes.
