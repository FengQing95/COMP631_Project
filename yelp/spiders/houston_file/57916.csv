Kata Robata////I brought my whole family from Louisiana to try Kata for Fathers Day and i can say it was a huge disappointment. Everything looks presentable, but lacked taste. Even my all time favorite Scallop with Foie Gras lacked flavor. Uni tasted fishy. Not only did i feel this way, my whole family had the same impression. Quality wasn't the same since the last time i went with friends. Our server was very polite and helped ordering a lot easier!
