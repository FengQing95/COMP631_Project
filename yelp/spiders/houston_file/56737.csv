Kata Robata////Kata is a place that you would take a special guest who's visiting Houston for only a day. It is that consistent and good. My boyfriend always jokes about ordering three duck sobas to eat as a whole entree. It really is a standout dish here along with the sushi. The servers are accommodating and knowledgeable. I could go on and on about how awesome Kata is, but I'll leave it at this: if you haven't gone then let it be your next meal.
