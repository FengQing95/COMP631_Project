JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place is small, so we did wait about 20 minutes on a sunday afternoon around 12:45. I liked the atmosphere, and did not mind sitting at the community table, but just keep in mind you will probably have to sit there if it is busy - by the time we left at 1:25 PM the waiting area was packed! Service is nice, but I leave a 4 star rating because I feel as though Ramen Tatsuya is around a similar price range, has that same depth of flavor, and gives you more for your money. Still, it's definitely a place worth checking out, and I'll return to try the JINYA bun!
