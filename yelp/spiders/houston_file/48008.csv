Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Their GLUTEN FREE pancakes are awesome! They aren't dairy free but if you want to splurge a little, they're amazing! I am gluten free and they have toast and can make the eggs & hash browns Â dairy free upon request. Great place for breakfast! There's always a wait, so come prepared! Definitely worth it though!
