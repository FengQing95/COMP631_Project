Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I will be honest guys, this place is just good for Instagram and posting on social media. Didn't see what all the hype was about. The food was good but great. Was it worth an hour and half in line ? No not at all. We should of went to IHOP to be honest. Wouldn't come here again if the line is so long like how it was when I visited. Maybe I ordered the wrong stuff or something but not worth it in my opinion.
