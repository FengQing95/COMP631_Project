Uchi////The fried milk this time was extremely subpar compared to all the other times I've been here. Ice cream was icy and bland, and they changed it up again so it's not as good as it used to be. AND THEY TOOK OUT THE MERINGUE PIECES AND SUPER DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF CHOCOLATE MOUSSE! Those were my absolute most favorite things about this dessert and they took it away and just poured a bunch of crumbs all over the plate for decoration. The chocolate pieces were actually kind of burnt too.
