Local Foods////Crunchy Chicken Sandwich is a winner! Went for lunch with a few friends and the higher price was worth the fresh and high quality ingredients. I also got the quinoa and kale, and finished lunch feeling light and satisfied instead of bloated and regretful. The restaurant has plenty of seating, is clean, and the atmosphere is great as well! I will definitely be going again!
