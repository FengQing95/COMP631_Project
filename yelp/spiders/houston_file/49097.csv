Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After weeks of seeing lines wrapped around this place, I finally convinced my husband to go on one of the mornings during the week we had off. Random Tuesday, 10:30 am, there's still about a 15 minute wait to sit down. The parking is not so great since the lot is SO SMALL, so you'll have to rely on neighborhood parking and a few spots that are available for parallel right on Montrose.
