Local Foods////We were in the Museum District and craving something yummy after a visit to King Tut with the kids.  I wasn't sure if Local Foods was it, but we decided to give it a try.  I've been to the location for Antone's several times, and was delighted by the changes.  The decor is beautiful, modern, trendy - perfect.  There were a few other people in the restaurant at this pre-dinner hour.  We got a big booth in the middle of the restaurant for the 5.5 of us and perused the menu.
