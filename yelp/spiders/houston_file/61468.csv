Baby Barnaby's////My friend got the breakfast plate and I got french toast with a side of bacon & eggs. Their potatoes are sooo good! The french toast had the right amount of cinnamon. The food was very well SEASONED in general! Â They have this really cool juicer machine and they make their orange juice fresh which I thought was super cool.
