Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////After a little over an hour, we received a text that our table was ready. We were starving, and thought that justified ordering a flight of pancakes as our appetizer. They were delicious! The pumpkin pancake is a seasonal special and has a cream cheese topping. It was probably my favorite, but followed closely by the blueberry Danish pancake. The OMG French toast was a little overpowering with its sweetness, but I can understand why others would love it.
