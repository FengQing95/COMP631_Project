Local Foods////Local Foods is my favorite restaurant in Houston. I feel weird describing it to people as "a sandwich place," because it is so much more than that. I've been coming to this original location since 2012, and I remember being skeptical at first. To my college student self, $12 seemed like a lot for a sandwich and some sides. But I was soon impressed by the portion sizes and how even my guy friends were full. Nowadays, I eat half my sandwich and one side and pack up the rest for the next day's lunch. The leftovers are just as good!
