Baby Barnaby's////Yep, it is an old building but swanky food! Great home style fries, breakfast tacos and coffee.  The chicken fried steak A-OK! just love the small felling of a community.  Food is always hot and tasty.  Cannot fit more than 35 for breakfast but there was never a line and sits were always full and people came in right on time.  If you feel awkward sitting to close to strangers while eating your meal, this place is not for you.  Do visit one of their other locations. My other favorite is at the Museum District. Check their hours first.
