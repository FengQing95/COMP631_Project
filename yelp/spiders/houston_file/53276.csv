Kata Robata////Hubbs enjoyed the beef tongue cooked two ways - I gave in and tried some tongue, but I couldn't get the visual image out of my head. Yes, I eat raw fish, but have a hard time with organ meats and things like that. It's just a mental block, but one that I couldn't get over. The pieces of tongue were very thinly sliced and flavorful, though a little gamey for my taste. Not tough at all, as I had expected, but the Hubbs was happy to finish the entire dish.
