JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Variety / Mastery: They make mostly Ramen, and they're pretty skilled at making good Ramen. I'd consider their authenticity and craft to be much better than some of the other Ramen places around, authentic noodles, and chashu that actually tasted realistic. Although, if you don't want traditional Ramen, they do have Vegetarian or Vegan Ramen and also many different meal sized appetizers you can try by yourself or with a group.
