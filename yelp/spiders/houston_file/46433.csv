Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond will always have a special place in my heart. It's got some tasty pastries that I love. Always a sure way to make someone's morning. I think the pastries are the best thing that the bakery has to offer. Food has always been just okay for me. The montrose location is my fave.
