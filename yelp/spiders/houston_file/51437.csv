Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got the spuds deluxe and the Snooze original. The spuds deluxe was good - a mound of very crispy flavorful hash topped with cheese, bacon and green onions. My snooze original was ok - nothing special about over easy eggs, bacon English muffin, and hash browns. My over easy eggs were watery and under done so I had to send it back. They re-did the order and gave me a card for free pancakes for the next visit. Nothing fancy about the bacon or English muffin. It came with house made apricot jam and the bacon was crispy. The hash brown cake was not as crispy as I'd like. But you can't really mess up the original - it just wasn't phenomenal.
