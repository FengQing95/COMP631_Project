JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Edit 2/19/16: Response to reply below:  So not to be deterred by my experience at Jinya and ready for a comparison, I went and tried Tiger Den last night.  You may visit their page for my review, but I'm glad I did.  In my own opinion,  my experience there was much better, it was like I entered flavor town and lost myself for a while in a slurping taste bud fest, my eggs were like nothing I ever had before and cooked to this delicate silky perfection, while on the otherhand at Jinya my eggs seemed old and overcooked), At Tiger Den the prices were at a considerably cheaper starting point and I feel the bowls there were larger.   In my Opinion, Jinya I left me with that feeling that what I ate I could have made at home much better with a store brand ramen pouch. Tiger Den, the flavor profiles were complex and that I could never make exactly the same thing from scratch)
