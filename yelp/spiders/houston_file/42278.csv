Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My sandwich was "good." The turkey was incredible, tender like most turkey isn't, and the mole sauce (which I asked them to go light on and miraculously they did) was unique and tasty. My sandwich was also impossible to eat without surgical instruments . . . maybe they should cut them in half for you ahead of time? These were HUGE sandwiches. I'm uploading photos later. So anyway. My sammie was "good," but still not 5 star good.
