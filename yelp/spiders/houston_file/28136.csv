The Pit Room////We wanted to sample many items so we got brisket, beef sausage, pork sausage, pork ribs, and pulled pork. It was all great. I think what I liked most was that it was flavorful, but not rich. I'm not sure what caused the difference, but I feel light and good after eating there. Eating at Killen's makes me feel heavy and sick all day.
