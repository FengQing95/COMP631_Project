Baby Barnaby's////Sucks that I live in Chinatown and have to drive so far to the amazing place. The atmosphere and environment was pretty awesome. It was small a bit dark, but it felt like home. I was surprised that the prices were so low! I don't usually fancy brunch places, but I definitely have to come back here more often.
