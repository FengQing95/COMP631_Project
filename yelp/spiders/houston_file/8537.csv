JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Melissa - Thanks for your review. I appreciate your candor, and would like to suggest one of our "dry noodle" dishes that do not contain broth: Tan Tan Men, Mazemen or Hiyashi Cold Ramen. They have all been featured as monthly specials and, resultingly, some are not listed on our menu. But we like to recommend these dishes to customers who are not big fans of soup in general. And for that very reason, we thank you for giving us a try and for the kind words regarding the other aspects of our house.
