The Pit Room////- the ribs.  Got a lb of them and they were so thin and not fatty.  They were the exact opposite of fall off the bone so much so that I held the bone while my dog (rescue pittie) played tug of war to get the meat off.  Overly peppered.  Ribs are my favorite and my benchmark for BBQ and that's why I give this place a lower spectrum review.
