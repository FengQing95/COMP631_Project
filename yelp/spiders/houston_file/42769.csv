Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Bread options were more limiting and certainly pricier than I would have liked, but the ones that were on the docket erred on the side of hearty and savory, even the sweet options. My scone had a biscuit-like mild saltiness and a tinge of sweetness. Lastly, coffee does get taken up a notch here, at least compared to many other bakeries.
