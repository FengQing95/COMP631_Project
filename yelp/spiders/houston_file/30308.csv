The Pit Room////I've been here once in person in August 2019, and returned again for takeout dinner in early May 2020. Both times I've ordered the same combo with slightly different side variation -- fatty brisket and a pork rib, once with coleslaw and potato salad and another with coleslaw and mac and cheese. I've also ordered their elote to-go.
