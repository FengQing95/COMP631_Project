Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Atmosphere: I did think it was weird that there was a bathroom attendant...what are we in a club? Also the music was WAY too loud to have conversations at dinner. It's a fine line an it seemed a little incongruent in an effort to be trendy. Overall, great location, decor and vibe. I'd go back
