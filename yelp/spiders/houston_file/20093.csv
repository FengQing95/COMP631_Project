Uchi////Then they built a Houston Uchi, and it just happens to be 2 blocks from my home. And then I discovered that every single item is essentially perfect. And expensive (but absolutely worth it). Is Uchi a "random Tuesday dinner" place? Not for my budget. But for a special occasion, you know that you will get impeccable service, a creative meal, and possibly the best dessert menu in Houston.
