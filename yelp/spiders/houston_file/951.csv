JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brian - Thank you for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. I'm also appreciative of your understanding our extended wait times. We do our best to keep the tables turning without rushing people along. But in our industry, that's usually easier said than done. Regardless, we thank you for your feedback, and we hope to see you again soon.
