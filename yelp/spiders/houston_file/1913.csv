JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your review. I'm sorry to hear the vegetable ramen didn't meet your expectations. Jinya is constantly tweaking and creating new items in hopes of improving the selection we can offer to our guests.  Next week, we have a new spicy vegan ramen and based on the feedback we've received from our corporate stores, it's received rave reviews. I'd like to invite you back next week and try the new vegan ramen.  I hope it meets your expectations. Please feel free to message me and I will make sure you're well taken care of.
