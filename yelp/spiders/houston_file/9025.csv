JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am surprised to read your description of Darcie's service. She has been with JINYA since we opened nearly four years ago and she has rarely -- if ever -- received such low marks. I spoke with her and she informed me that she apologized if she had been curt with you and offered to make things right, though you declined.
