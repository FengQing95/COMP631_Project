Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great place for brunch and study location! Very tasty food and yummy desserts. Price was alright, a little on the higher-end, but definitely worth it! We have been coming here more now for the desserts and French Onion Soup (My girlfriend's favorite!) Great pies during Thanksgiving as well! The French Onion Soup is a must-try though! The macarons are nice, but incomparable to other specialized macarons places. Still want to encourage you to try everything though, especially if you are local to Houston, Tx. Great study location, spacious, plenty of places to study and do work. Fast Wi-Fi, friendly staffs and owners! If you're not into desserts, I would recommend just getting their French baguettes with their butter! Great snacks during work/ study. They will cut it and heat it up for you as well! Most of the staffs are great, friendly and helpful, except one of the guys that was working at the cashier tonight, he sounded and acted like he did not want to be here, or had a long day. Don't blame him though, if he's been here for an entire day, but still, if you're working in the service industry, you have to be able to serve your customers well.
