Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Rating based on our specific order and service. I love the idea of a pancake flight, but not when it takes nearly an hour to arrive after ordering. For some reason, our order was not placed with the kitchen until 30 minutes later. By the time our order arrived for a table of 5, we noticed two other tables had been seated after us but received their order before us. I understand Snooze's popularity, but on a Thursday morning brunch orders should not take that long.
