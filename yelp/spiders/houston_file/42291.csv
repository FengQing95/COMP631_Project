Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Super cute and trendy bakery. Got lucky and found a parking spot, but the lot was very full. They had a sign up saying there was additional parking around the corner, so you'll want to take that into consideration. Â The line can be long at times but moves pretty quickly. I went around lunch time and the place was full of people enjoying the restaurant food and hanging out around the coffee bar. Purchased a croissant (decent), pistachio croissant, a few cookies and macaroons. The chocolate and chocolate chip macaroons were my favorite items from everything I purchased. Would go back again to try the breakfast sandwiches, or for a light lunch.
