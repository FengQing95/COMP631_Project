Kata Robata////As someone who eats sushi more than any sane person should, I look for the taste, presentation, cost/value. Kata Robata puts forth solid sushi and sashimi, but to me, the restaurant is not worth the hype. The portion was less than I expected, which I would have been okay with if everything else was delicious as well.
