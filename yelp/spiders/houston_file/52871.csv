Kata Robata////The food was solidly decent, though, despite the lackluster service.  The sashimi we ordered was pretty good, as well as the nigiri pieces.  My guest ordered two rolls afterwards and enjoyed both of them, while I ordered a bit more nigiri.  Things were looking up, we thought, until dessert arrived.  We ordered the creme brulee and it came out unset.  No creme at all, mainly a liquid mush.  Our server actually had the gall to tell me that "that's the way we make it here."  If that's the way that Kata Robata makes their creme brulee, count me out.  No one should ever eat that pile of trash for dessert.  We didn't even take a spoonful of it out, but dutifully, we were definitely charged for the dessert.
