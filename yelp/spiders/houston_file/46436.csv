Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've always loved Common Bond's food and especially the pastries but I was very disappointed this time bc their cookie was undercooked. The person serving me was not very engaging so I asked for two of each flavor of Macarons but she left out one flavor that I really wanted so that was disappointing.
