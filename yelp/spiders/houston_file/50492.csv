Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////In summation, I proudly proclaim that I had no idea what I was talking about at the beginning of this meal, but now I have seen the light. Whether you have to wait 45 minutes or an hour or a year, this place is worth it. Scratch your upcoming weekend plans and jump on this wagon as soon as you possibly can. You will not regret it.
