Uchi////First things first, I highly advise for you to make a reservation, especially on a Friday & Saturday. When we walked in the hostess wouldn't sit our party of 3 unless our entire party was there.. Personally, I think that rule is beyond ridiculous because most restaurants will sit your part if half of the party has arrived. The hostess was also not that pleasant of a person to talk to either. Once we all arrived we were sat and then greeted from our waitress in about 5 minutes. Â
