Local Foods////Hands down the best sandwich shop I have ever been to. I drunkenly stumbled in this place when I was in college thinking it was still Antone's. After eating the best chicken sandwich I ever had, I promised myself I would return when sober. A week or two later, I came back in with some friends before we hit the bars in the village and I had the best smoked salmon I ever had eaten.
