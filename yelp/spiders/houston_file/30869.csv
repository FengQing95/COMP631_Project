The Pit Room////Recently ordered a cooked turkey here for Friendsgiving and was very impressed with how it tasted. I'm deducting a star from the review because the staff was unorganized and unprofessional when I came to pick up my order. I placed an order for a turkey and 2 quarts of gravy. Upon arrival, I told the cash register my name and she was clueless that I had an order placed. She looks for my turkey, which is sitting on the table next to the placed orders and hands me to turkey with no gravy. She was unaware that I even placed an order for 2 quarts of gravy and she had to ask someone about my order. During my wait for the gravy, I received no cooking instructions on how I was supposed to cook the turkey. I had to ask since it was not labeled to the turkey. [Side note: It needs to be in the oven for 1.5 hours prior to serving] Honestly, the turkey was well worth the headache of this unorganized process but I'm hoping next year will be better.
