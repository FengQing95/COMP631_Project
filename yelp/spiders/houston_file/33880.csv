Local Foods////My favorite sandwiches are the duck confit, smoked salmon on bagel, and the truffled egg on pretzel bun. These three sandwiches are consistently delicious and filling, enough for a good meal now and a snack later. My favorite soups are the vegan chili (I'm the opposite of a vegetarian, but this stuff is so good!), the lemongrass soup, and when they have it, the avocado soup. Things I didn't love include: any sandwiches with horseradish (they put way too much in and it overpowers all the other flavors), most of the sides (they're all really 'healthy' and taste odd, except the kale which is tasty), and the crunchy chicken sandwich (everyone seems to love it, but it wasn't anything spectacular to me and the chicken came cold).
