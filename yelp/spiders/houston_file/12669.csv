JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: I had the Tonkotsu Black ramen. Good and has a lot going on in the dish. For an appetizer order the pork gyoza. Honestly, I don't think ramen is my thing. There was a lot going on in the dish, the pork was super fatty and the boiled egg in the dish just wasn't my thing.
