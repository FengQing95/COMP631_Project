JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sunday was much easier.  We went around 7 and were sat immediately.  We sat at one of their large communal tables in the middle, which wasn't ideal but seemed to work fine for a quick Sunday evening meal.  We started with the potstickers, which they said were made fresh daily.  They didn't disappoint!  The 3 sauces at each table were also fun to experiment with.  I mixed the spicy sauce with both the ponzu and ramen seasoning- excellent choice if you like a lil kick!
