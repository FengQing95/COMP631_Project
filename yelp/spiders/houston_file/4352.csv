JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is amazing! The Spicy Chicken ramen is perfectly spicy, before I moved out of Texas I visited this place weekly if not more. To be honest, I never tried anything other than the Spicy Chicken because it is just that delicious! Good atmosphere, appetizers, service, & ramen. I would eat this every day if I could!
