Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had a great server named Aaron Aka triple A. It was a group of 6 of us. We arrived at 11:30am on a Friday morning. The wait was about 1hr-1.5 hr long. They do have the "text when table is ready" function. So I would recommend at least one member of your party get placed on the list while you look for parking.
