Uchi////We ordered the Hama chili, hamachi nabe, walu walu, Brussels sprouts, the wagyu, and the shag roll. Definitely more than enough food for two people (and pricey), but it was all worth it! We didn't have any room for dessert but the couple next to us at the community table ordered the peanut butter semifreddo and raved about it.
