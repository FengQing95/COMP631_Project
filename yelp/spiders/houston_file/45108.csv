Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////So obviously, my first visit was a little underwhelming. I went with the Hubbs to Snooze on Wednesday, in an excited flurry to welcome them to Houston, only to sorely find out that their true opening day was the next day and that they were closed to the public for a private event. Frustrated but determined to go somewhere "good" for breakfast, I recommended Common Bond to the Hubbs (since he had never been there before). He agreed, and off we went.
