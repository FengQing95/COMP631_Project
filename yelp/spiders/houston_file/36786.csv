Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////5 stars for service. Our waiter Terry, was funny and nice. He gave us free dessert and gave us a tour of their whiskey room. Our food came out promptly, dishes cleared quickly and water refilled frequently. I gave 4 stars because of the food. We ordered shaved pork chop sandwich, fries and power spinach salad. The salad was good, but the sandwich had chewy bacon and slightly dry pork chop. The fries seemed to be double deep fried? The crispy layer was extra thick and overly crispy if that makes sense. Unfortunately, the dessert (red velvet churros) we got was the same way with thick crunchy outer layer. I much prefer the costco churros.
