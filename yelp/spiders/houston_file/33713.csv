Local Foods////I've been on a egg salad sandwich tear as of late.  I used to hate the stuff unless my friend Liz made it.  Deli salads were her thing (potato, tuna, chicken, egg), and I was always partial to the potato, but the egg salad was a close second...not that the chicken or tuna was paltry by any means.
