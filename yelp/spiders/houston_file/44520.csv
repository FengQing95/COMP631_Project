Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Today a friend and I were served the worst coffee/tea we've ever had. And I've been to Starbucks. I ordered a Milk and Honey (add lavender, almond milk) Latte, and my friend ordered a Chai. I've ordered this latte three previous times and each time it was phenomenal until today. Today it tasted like I was drinking a liquified burnt paper cup, and her chai (I tried it) tasted like dirty dish water with a cinnamon tea bag in it.
