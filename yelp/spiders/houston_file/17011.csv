JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow what incredible service, and incredible food. When everyone walks in the staff all greet us with welcoming words in Japanese. The food was timely and amazing. I have posted the items that we had and both were spot on. The amount of food you get for the price was perfect, we had another meal in leftovers. Do yourself a favor make a visit, you won't be sorry.
