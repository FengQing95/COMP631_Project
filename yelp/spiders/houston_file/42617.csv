Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Visited this morning for the first time. The baked goods are great but this place is a study in inefficiency. It took me 40 minutes to get 3 pastries, a baguette and an iced coffee. The irony is that the staff actually seems to be working hard but they are so inefficient they aren't accomplishing anything. Seriously, this place makes the post office look efficient.
