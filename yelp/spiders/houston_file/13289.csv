JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My standing order is spicy tonkatsu.  JINYA does it better than all 50 of the other ramen shops I've been to and my husband agrees.  For two foodies to agree on that means this place is surely worthy of you giving it a try.  I cannot wait for them to open in the DFW area. Until then, we will look forward to visit every few months.
