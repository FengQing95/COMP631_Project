JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been told this is one of the best Japanese Ramon noodles place in Houston, but I was kind of disappointed. It is the soup make the noodle special, either than that, the noodles and meat is just average, portion is small. There are better Ramon noodles places in Houston!
