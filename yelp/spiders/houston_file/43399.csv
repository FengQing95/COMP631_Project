Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There's probably going to be a line. This should be no surprise since you probably had to drive around a bit just to find parking. But, take it as a sign that you made the right decision to visit this well-loved location. I grabbed a menu, and was pleasantly surprised that it had the perfect range of brunch dishes. There's some savory and hearty dishes as well as some light and sweet ones. I ordered the shakshuka sweet potato (hash?) and my friend got the classic biscuits and gravy. She also ordered a coffee and I opted for a chai tea latte. We found the most perfect booth located on the opposite side of the drinks bar, right by the window that led to the street. Besides our actual meals, yelp advised us that we must get a croissant, so my friend got the plain one and I decided on the almond croissant. Â We were not disappointed with anything. Our food came out shortly, both topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg. The flavors were amazing in my shashuka dish and the biscuits and gravy tasted just as they should: buttery and warm. My chai latte was beautiful and paired amazingly with the almond croissant.
