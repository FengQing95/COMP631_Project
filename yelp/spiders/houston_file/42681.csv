Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I patiently waited a bit for the latte to arrive but finally gave up and got myself some water. I watched as over the next 20 minutes several dishes of luncheon sandwiches were served to other tables and at the bar. Still no latte. At 11:20 my sandwich arrived with the server who asked if I was waiting for anything else. My croissant was long gone (which was very good, BTW) so it was kind of late for a latte, but I told him that I was still awaiting my coffee. I began to eat the sandwich and drink water until the latte was delivered...nearly a half hour after I had placed the order...and some of it was slopped over into a puddle in the saucer.
