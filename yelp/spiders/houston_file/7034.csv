JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rachael - Thank you for your kind review. I especially appreciate your feedback regarding your feeling rushed by our servers. I will speak to my staff to make sure they take a breath and slow things down a bit. Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks to running a fast-paced, high-volume restaurant is that sometimes it can be difficult to switch gears. Nevertheless, this type of constructive criticism helps us improve our business by highlighting issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. And for that we thank you.
