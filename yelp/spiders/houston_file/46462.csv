Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I bought several pastries mostly to share my neighbor. Hopefully she'll like the pumpkin cheese croissant, pistachio croissant, and kugelhopf (classic and boston cream). My sister-in-law bought pastries to go as well. Hers were a couple of different scones, peppermint croissant, and a loaf of multigrain bread.
