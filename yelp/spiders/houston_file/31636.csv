Local Foods////My new favorite lunch spot. I had the harvest salad with shrimp. It was amazing but a little too large so come with an appetite or you could share. My boyfriend had the crunchy chicken and lemongrass soup. I tried a both and they were delicious. The place was really cute inside and staff was very friendly. Â I will definitely be back!
