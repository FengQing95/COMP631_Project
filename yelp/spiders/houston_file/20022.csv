Uchi////Words simply cannot express my love for this restaurant and the product they serve. Just some tips...Get the Foie Nigiri, Add a few pieces of the various veggie nigiri, save room for dessert, Make sure you have ample time to enjoy your food, DONT go in there with a budget, eat with your hands and prepare for your mind to be blown.
