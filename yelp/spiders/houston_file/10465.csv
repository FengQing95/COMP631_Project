JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time having authentic ramen per my daughters suggestion... I was not feeling well and wanted some soup so ramen it is... I orderd my soap via favor and could of not been more pleased with my order... I went with the wonton chicken ramen... It was very tasty and satisfying... The portion was enough for me to have for lunch the next day... I am looking forward in returning to experience the other ramen soups...
