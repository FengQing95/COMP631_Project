JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mohit - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. Please know that you can always request "Less Salt" with your ramen when ordering. We have numerous adjustments that aren't listed on the menu (for reasons of space), and if you're not 100% happy with your meal, you can always send it back and we'll make you a new bowl asap. We appreciate your business and hope to serve you again soon!
