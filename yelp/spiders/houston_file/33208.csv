Local Foods////4/5: Gulf Shrimp and Blue Grab- stuffed to the max with sweet crab meat and fresh gulf shrimp- pickled onion, dressing as a binder... So good! The only problem I had with is item is the bread.  I love ciabatta, but it's not exactly a soft bread and because it's packed with crab/shrimp, it makes it hard to get your mouth around it.  (My boyfriend and I both cut the sides of our mouth eating it) I would get it again but I would ask if I could get a pretzel roll instead (however I'm not sure how strict Local Foods is about changing items- I'll update you all if I do this)
