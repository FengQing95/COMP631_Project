JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So happy that this place lived up to the high praises others have given. My boyfriend and I dropped by for lunch and ordered gyoza, takoyaki and the tonkatsu spicy (3 different levels: mild, spicy and hot). He opted for the mild and I the spicy but I think they switched our bowls. Not taking stars off for this for the simple fact that we still enjoyed what we ended up with. We added soft boiled eggs which were boiled to perfection and the pork was so juicy. Loved it. Service was also excellent- we were greeted at the door, no wait (we came in around noon on a Sunday) and server was quick and attentive.
