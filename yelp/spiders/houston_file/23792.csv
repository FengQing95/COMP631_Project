Uchi////Now this place is so good, you have to know upfront what you are willing to spend. If you go all in like I did, it can be more expensive than a Michelin star restaurant (I actually have eaten at Michelin star restaurants that weren't this good but that's for another day ). One of the dishes was with uuni, caviar and gold leaves but so well balanced it was worth it. And then there was Wagyu A5. And then there was foie gras. And then, and then, and then, ... oh and the sake! A very wide choice of really good sake.
