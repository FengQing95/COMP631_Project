Baby Barnaby's////I am always trying to find new places to try when I am in the city on Mon, Wed, & Fri and have always seen Baby Barnaby's on yelp but never stopped to try it. Well today I did. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was GREAT. I can kick myself that I didn't take a picture. When I walked in I was greeted by two very cheerful people and both of them were always checking on me. Will I be back? Â OH YES!!! Will I try something else? Yes most definitely. The food all looks amazing and I can't wait to try other things. What I really like about this place is when someone walks in, they are greeted like they are family. Some are greeted by name. The gentleman that was working kept asking everybody that entered if they did okay during the storm. I love that!!! I can't wait to come back.
