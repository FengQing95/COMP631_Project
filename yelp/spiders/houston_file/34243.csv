Local Foods////I've eaten at Local Foods multiple times (probably between 5 and 10), because of the organic culture of the restaurant. I've always heard that the ingredients are brought in from local farmer's markets each day to prepare the menu. Also, the menu is always a good twist on classic sandwiches and salads-- why have a regular pulled pork sandwich when you can have a lemongrass pulled pork sandwich with roasted red peppers and aioli? (That was one of the specials, which are always worth checking out).
