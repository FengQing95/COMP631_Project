JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They know their ingredients and how to incorporate them into a full-flavored broth and create an unforgettable combination with handmade noodles. Plus, they apparently only use Fuji water to prepare the high quality broth! There's a wide array of authentic toppings to add to your ramen bowl and take it to the next level. Everyone will have different tastes, but I personally enjoy the premium tonkotsu white, cha cha cha (I heart garlic), and spicy chicken. Not too salty, right amount of accoutrements, noodle and fat--such a perfect balance of flavors! I usually get my ramen fix with a single bowl alone since it's so filling, but the combinations and tapas are pretty cool when you've been starving yourself lately. Plus, I love that they offer iced green tea!
