Baby Barnaby's////If you're looking for a solid breakfast, you're in the right place. My favorite order is the Green Eggs. They also have amazing fresh orange juice. If you're just looking for grub and not the wait, I definitely recommend calling ahead for take out. The wait gets pretty crazy and the seating space is really cozy. The guys who run Baby Barnaby's are super friendly and make you feel like part of the neighborhood.
