The Pit Room////I was part of a party of 7 that stopped by on a late Saturday afternoon.  The line was not too bad, and it moved pretty well anyway.  All of us were first timers to The Pit Room.  The consensus was that we loved the food.  The price is slightly higher than the BBQ chains around town.  The only drawback we had was that indoor seating was limited in the main building.  Thankfully, it was nice day and we sat outdoors.
