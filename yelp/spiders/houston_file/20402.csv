Uchi////Went to dinner at Uchi last night for the first time and I had a wonderful experience! Apparently DJ Khaled had been here when Beyonc√© came to town for her concert so it got even more popular. They gave us a warm towel to start us off and a cup of sake in a box that traditional Japanese drink out of...then We continued with Hama chili, walu walu as appetizers, went onto having unagi, Nasu and hamachi for the main course, finally ended with fried milk for dessert! I would have to say this had to be considered my cheat meal for the week but sooo worth it
