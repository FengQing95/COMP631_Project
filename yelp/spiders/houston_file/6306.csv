JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant overall isn't that big. The layout is long and narrow, with a small bar in front and a dining bar in back facing the kitchen. What I'm trying to say is this place gets packed...at lunch and dinner. There isn't much room inside to wait either, so you may be waiting outside for your name to be called. Once you are seated, you'll see it's well worth the wait.
