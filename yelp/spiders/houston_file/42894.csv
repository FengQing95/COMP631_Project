Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Onto the meat of the matter, I wouldn't say anything on the menu truly "wow"ed me. The first time around, I got the croque monsieur, and it wasn't terrible, but I didn't notice anything special about it that I couldn't get for cheaper somewhere else. The second time around, I got yet another sandwich, something simple with a baguette, ham, and cheese--it was already prepared and next to all the pastries. For only about four inches of sandwich, I paid six dollars. My friends got the biscuits and gravy the first time around and said that was wonderful, but a bit expensive. That being said, the portions are a fair size. Maybe I just didn't get the right things?
