JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I like getting the Tonkotsu black ramen since it's flavorful. Their takoyaki is delicious. Chicken karaage is pretty decent. The spicy tonkotsu is good as well. The goku Midnight black had a huge piece of chasu. Chasu bowl was good. Overall, everything is tasty. The prices for ramen may be on the higher end but they give a lot of toppings included.
