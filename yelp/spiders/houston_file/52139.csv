Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First time eating at this chain. There was no wait , so we were seated immediately. My chai latte was nice and hot, just a little spicy, but very good. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and my mom got the French toast neat with a side with a side of bacon andAnd scrambled egg. Unfortunately we sent everything back because the temperature was lukewarm on all of our food. The waitress put a rush on our order and we were giving our next meal within 15 minutes which kind of begs the question... Once we got the food it was delicious. The bacon was delicious and crispy. The pot pie pastry was light airy fluffy and flaky. When we got our bill we were discounted a credit of $15 for the temperature of our food which we did not ask for and I thought was a nice touch. All in all, The food was solid and I will likely return
