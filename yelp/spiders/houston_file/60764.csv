Baby Barnaby's////Total dive among the posh and trendy restaurants that dot the Montrose area. I'm not trying to cut them down in fact I loved our visit to Baby Barnaby's. The interior space seats less than 40 so expect to either sit outside or wait as this place is popular. I get the vibe here while another first timer complained about the lack of an espresso machine to his friends; suck it up dude your gonna live.
