JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is one of my favorite places to grab Ramen in Houston! I always get the Cha Cha Cha (4.5/5) which is for garlic lovers. The broth was heavenly and the ramen was cooked to perfection. I usually ask for them to make it spicy and it comes out perfect: not too spicy, just right. I also got the Takoyaki (4/5) if you like them at other places you love them here!! The service wasn't amazing or anything but they weren't bad. Overall I had a great experience and left VERY SATISFIED!
