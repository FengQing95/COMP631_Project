Kata Robata////Love the signature rolls here! Love how the outside area is enclosed and climate controlled! Staff is very friendly and attentive. Only issue I had was with the fresh lemonade. It was very very acidic. In my personal opinion it had too much lemon in it and not enough water. However I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice sushi spot to eat at in the Upper Kirby area! Definitely try the Sexy a Scallop Roll, it's very good!
