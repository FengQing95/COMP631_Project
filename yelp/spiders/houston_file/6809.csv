JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////No reservations. Always line out the door but thats because the food is WORTH IT. I wish they still had the chicken karaage ramen but nonetheless, still amazing. Takoyaki (octopus balls) are my go-to appetizer. If you eat pork, try the Jinya Black Ramen! Cute concept inside. The middle shareable tables do get a bit crowded. If only the centered stones decor were smaller, there would be more space on the table to eat!
