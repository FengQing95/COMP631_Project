JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The experience you had today at Jinya is unacceptable.  It is one of my golden rules never to rush customers. This should not have happened and I do apologize.  I would really like to know the server that rushed you through your meal as I need to have a talk with him/her.   Nevertheless, I will address this issue to all my staff members.  I appreciate your feedback as this is the only way for us to improve.  Pls text or reach out to me at 650-906-6308.  I would love to invite you back to Jinya to have the kind of experience that you deserve.
