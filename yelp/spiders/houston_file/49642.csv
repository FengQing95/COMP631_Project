Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love snooze. I've been to so many locations from California to Colorado. This is my first Texas stop. To start out they don't use the NOWAIT app so that was concerning. We were told our wait was around 1-1.5 hours. That's about average. We had our drinks as we waited. I noticed a couple tables where people would walk in and be seated immediately. I get being a local/knowing people helps get you a table quicker but ya know it's not a good look.
