Uchi////We sat with Chef Patrick (if you get a seat at the sushi bar - you in essence get a private chef, which is unreal) and he was so much fun.  Personable, talented, funny, creative and ONLY 20 YEARS OLD.  This guy has a bright future on the Houston culinary scene....trust me.  We told him we had no food allergies and were ready to have him take us on a trip of the menu, with nothing but his favorites.  MAN, was that a good decision.
