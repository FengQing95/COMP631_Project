JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Luckily for the bf and myself, we were in the area early on a saturday morning, so we showed up within 30 minutes of it opening. So, YAY, no wait! We were promptly seated in a cute booth, fit for two (and only two). I did notice the full bar (not the bar in front of the chefs in the back) in front, which was completely empty at the time, and pondered sitting there, but decided against it as I wanted the complete experience of the restaurant, seeing as it was our first time.
