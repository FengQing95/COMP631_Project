Local Foods////Local Foods is great! The sandwiches are great and they have really big portions. The sides are super unique. Also, everything is super healthy! The prices are kind of on the expensive side so get ready to pay $9-14 for a sandwich and 2 sides. Parking wasn't terrible. However, the seating inside the restaurant was an issue. There was just so many people eating here for lunch and barely any seats left. Other than that, our service was spectacular!
