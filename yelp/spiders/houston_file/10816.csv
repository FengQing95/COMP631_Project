JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////There is often a long wait (unless during the lunch hour). Great appetizers, cozy and fun environment. The waitress was very helpful in deciding what to order. I loved their California Poke Bowl. Only downside was the random sewer-like odor that randomly wafted through, although they are doing street work out front, its possible this was a blip.
