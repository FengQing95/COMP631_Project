Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Iâ€™m so sorry to hear that your experience with our short rib was a let down. Normally we have food that is delicately salted to perfection and I feel terrible that we missed the mark on this one. I would love it if you would allow us the opportunity to try again. Please reach out to me directly here and I will make accommodations for you and a guest to dine in on me. I look forward to hearing back from you.
