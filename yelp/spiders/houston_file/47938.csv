Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had the breakfast pot pie and enjoyed it. I was expecting a bit more as far as the pot pie goes but it was still a decent dish. The wait can be frustrating which is why I was thinking this place was going to be phenomenal. I wouldn't mind coming back but not anytime soon. I have had better breakfast elsewhere.
