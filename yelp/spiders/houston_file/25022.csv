Uchi////I mean where do I start? Everything was so spectacular. We came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. Luckily we hit their hh time on a Sunday. Our server was really nice and helpful. We ordered 4 rolls, a few uni and a few appetizers. And also 2 sake bomb sets. You can tell that it gets quite busy at the restaurant on the weekend because the place got packed. Quick.
