Local Foods////First time to eat here.  Very pleasantly surprised.  The Crunchy Chicken Sandwich was very good and more than I could eat in one sitting.   The standout was the cold watermelon soup.   Absolute perfection!   Can't wait to go back and check out the other dishes.   Friendly staff too.  Impressive!
