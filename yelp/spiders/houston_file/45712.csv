Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'm not so into cafes, but this one is nice and always busy,  so i dropped in one late weekend afternoon.  I ordered their cheesecake and it was not all that, and certainly did not justify it's $6.50 price tag.  It was pretty, decorated with brown, white, and orange chocolate milk chocolate pieces,  but it's what's on the inside that matters most, and this contained sweet, tart, dark cherries that I was not so fond of.
