Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In summary, my top 3 meal items were the hush puppies, cajun brick chicken, and the bosscat burger. You can't go wrong with ANY of these. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend these three items. My 2 biggest complaints are the noise level and that you're charged $0.50 per extra sauce that you request. Request to sit in the back if you want any chance of carrying on a conversation. The food definitely is on the pricey side and the bill can add up quick, but it's absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try.
