JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Furthermore, I am very surprised to learn that your server did not offer to remake your dish or offer you an alternative. My only presupposition is that your server was one of our newer employees, and he failed to relay your experience to the manager on duty. To that end, I will speak to all of my staff to review your experience and make sure this doesn't happen again. I appreciate your review and valuable feedback.
