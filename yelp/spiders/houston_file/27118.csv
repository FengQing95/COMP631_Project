The Pit Room////This is my first time to pit room. Being a native Texan, I have high standards for barbecue. When you first walk in, you walk straight to the counter and you look at the menu on the chalkboard and order what you want. I ordered three meat platter as that my friend Brian. I got the pork ribs, venison sausage, and the moist brisket. The brisket was fantastic!The pork ribs were well seasoned, not too dry, but smaller than ribs I'm used to. The sausage left something to be desired. The House pickles and jalape√±os were delicious! Brian's platter substituted the sausage for barbecue chicken. He said it well seasoned and tender. Initially, the portions did not look that big; however, I could not even finish my plate. The barbecue is on the sweeter side of barbecue sauces and less on the tangy side. The fresh lemonade quenched my thirst after the tasty barbecue. For sides we've both got the grilled okra and the mac & cheese. For a local joint, at about 1:30 PM on a Friday afternoon, there was plenty of seating. Beer is available as well. Ambience was nice with wooden tables and it was not too loud. In addition the front of the restaurant has a outside patio with an area to sit and eat.
