Baby Barnaby's////Be prepared to wait! But more than worth the wait!!! I was a lil confused in how to request for a table, they have a note pad in the middle of dining customers for you to sign up for a table. Wish they had a sign on their designated outdoor wait area to let customers know they need to sign in on the sheet hanging on the outdoor patio.
