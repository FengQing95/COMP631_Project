Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////my uncle won the struggle and ordered a hash brown dish covered in eggs and stuffed with your choose of excellent fillings. Flavorful is an understatement. I "lost" with two kinds of sandwiches: ciabatta and Â prosciutto and a muffin with ham. I will fail to explain how very different they were from each other but oh so very good. We shared pancake of the day which the helpful waitress explained is a favorite.
