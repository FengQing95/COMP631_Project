Local Foods////This is not a cheap sandwich shop, with our sandwiches costing $10.50 and $13 each, but they were well worth it for the fresh local ingredients and awesome taste. The staff was very friendly. I ordered a soup with my sandwich but changed my mind after already paying because I wanted the 2 sides. They made the change with no hesitation. it's a cool place, not fancy but modern and comfortable. Parking is a little tight with 2 other restaurants in the same building.
