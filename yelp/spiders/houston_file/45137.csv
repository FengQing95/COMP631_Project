Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We also opted for the chicken liver mousse (8$) too. It was served w/ two slices of baguette, pickled beets, cornichons, & rapini. I could've passed on the mousse itself. However, the pickles veggies were really good. I wish they sliced the bread into smaller & thinner bite size pieces too
