JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So glad I happened to find this place. The ramen is so delicious! First things first...the dumplings. Oh so good! Very tender and flavorful. Put a little gyoza sauce on it and that is almost a meal in itself. But it can't be, because there is still ramen to eat. The broth was so delicious and addictive, and the chicken breast was super tender. Don't get scared and choose mild. I think you will miss out on the amazing flavor if you don't go with spicy.
