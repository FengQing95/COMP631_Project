The Pit Room////My friends and me went to this restaurant for my birthday and we had a great time. The place has a real urban, cozy setting and the food was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the three meat plate with brisket, jalape√±o cheese sausage, and turkey. The meet was very tender and extremely flavorful; brisket had a nice bark, the turkey was juice and tender and the homemade sausage was on point. This is the best BBQ inside the loop and certainly one of Houston's best places for down home BBQ.
