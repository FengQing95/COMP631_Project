Kata Robata////Uni and Black Truffle Soba: buckwheat soba, fried taro chips, oyster mushroom, black truffle, sea urchin, uni foam, wasabi vinaigrette-- flavors again combining very well and perfect mixing of textures.  same with yuzu marinated salmon--roasted cauliflower mousse was a great touch.  toro good and texas hamachi roll tiny, compact but also good.  great dessert tres leches crossed with strawberry shortcake, so less liquidity than traditional tres leches. had good service
