Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our food took 30-45 minutes to arrive and when I looked around, other customers with different waiters got their food before us even though we were seated before them by 10-15 minutes. The waiter wasn't even the one to give us our food and he never checked in with us to see if the food was good or if we needed anything else.
