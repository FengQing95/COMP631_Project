JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Lala - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you felt disappointed with your meal. After reviewing the photo you posted, please know that your broth was, in fact, made "spicy" as you requested. This is indicated by the reddish tint of the broth. The "line of spice" is the dollop of spicy sauce that comes with this bowl of ramen.
