Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the Green Eggs - scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts, and jack cheese. It comes with a sausage, potatoes, and choice of bread (see above). The eggs were fantastic - very tasty and almost seem slightly healthy with the addition of the vegetables (at least that is what I tell myself). The breakfast potatoes were fried to that perfect crisp. The biscuits were buttery, honey, soft goodness. The sausage was mildly sweet, but smokey at the same time - very good.
