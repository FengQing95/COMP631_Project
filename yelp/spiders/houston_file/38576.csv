Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had the shrimp + grits and avocado toast.  I had the shrimp and grits deconstructed because i like sweet grits and i added they shrimp and the egg to my avocado toast.  I created a meal. The sauce was basically a picante sauce. The shrimp alone was good. But i would def re-evaluate that sauce.  They're avocado toast isn't the best I've had in Houston but it isn't bad.  It was fulfilling (once i added the shrimp and egg). We were in a medium sized party and was kind of tossed in the middle of the walkway.  But nonetheless, place was nice. Food was good. Will def come back for a 2nd try.
