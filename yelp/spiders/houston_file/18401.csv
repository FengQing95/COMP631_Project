Uchi////Mine and my cousin's first time at Uchi was #SOworth the 1.5 hours of traffic we traveled to get there + the 2 hour wait to get a table! (They were fully booked by the time I called to make a reservation that morning.) We waited with one of their signature dishes. Uchi's brussel sprouts is definitely green crack! It's unique taste of fish caramel + chili + line is #SOaddictive #SOgood  We washed the flavors down w subtle flavors of their famous cocktails. I had #KaraKyuri - cold sake + cucumber + Thai chili + yuzu. I don't often drink cocktails, but this one was #SOyummy  You taste the sake and the cucumber first, then the mouth is very slightly tickled by the chili. My cousin had #Ryoshu - sparkling wine + elderflower + bitters + frozen blueberry - light and #SOrefreshing
