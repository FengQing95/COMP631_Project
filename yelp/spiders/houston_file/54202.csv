Kata Robata////Pricy but rightfully so because this was some of the best sushi I've ever had! I also enjoyed the clean comfortable venue. This is the perfect combo of quality and presentation. We sat at the sushi counter where master chef Manabu Horiuchi was creating one masterpiece after another. This was defiantly an added bonus! He's like a ninja master wielding a knife making precision cuts at a terrifying speed. I've sat at a sushi counter before but this man is something else. The ambience is dressy (meet up with friends or date night style) and the service moved along. It was really crowded and I don't remember if we had a reservation but I would recommend making one. All in all, I was satisfied by my experience here and would come back again for the fresh tasty food, classy ambiance and amazing show of skills.
