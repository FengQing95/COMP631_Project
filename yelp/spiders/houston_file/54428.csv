Kata Robata////I don't like to ever post negative reviews. However, after the worst dinning experience ever!!!! I must. A group of colleagues decided to go to have sushi. I was starving and joined them. As we are waiting for our food to come a huge roach came crawling by my foot. You can imagine how grossed out I was. I let that slide. I wasn't to pleased but continued to wait for my much anticipated sushi plate. Yummy. Finally it arrived. I had to pieces when I saw something walking across my plate. This insect was exploring every roll on my plate. I waved the waiter to come to our table. He was taking care of other dinners. As I waited I watched this bug, nat insect enjoy him self in my food. The waiter came. I pointed it out. He the. Proceeded to kill it with his finger in front of me. At this point EVERYONE at my table stopped eating their food. When the bill came they comped only my sushi and charged me for my $7.00 drink. I gave the bill back and told him to comp my drink. I came to eat and left feeling grossed out. He proceeded to call the manager. The manager was extremely rude and didn't want to comp my drink. It wasn't the 7.00. It was the principle. I told him I would post a review on yelp and he said he didn't take to kindly to threats. Thank GOD desert gallery was next door. That's all I could stomach for the day. I will never go back. Horrible food and the management is so arrogant. Beware. I took pics and don't know how to load it on here.
