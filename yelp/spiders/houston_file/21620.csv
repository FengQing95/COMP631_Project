Uchi////Originally based in Austin and headed by head chef Tyson Cole, Uchi continuously garners high praise for its innovative, yet simplistic dishes. Now if you consider yourself a sushi sensei of any sort, you would know better than to order one of those overworked rolls with every ingredient imaginable, fried in tempura, layered with mayo, and dunked in a pool of soy sauce. Uchi however, will offer you that untraditional twist without muddling your taste buds with excessiveness. The restaurant's philosophy is about upholding impeccable balance between various flavor profiles while keeping many of the ingredients simple and pure. Unlike other fine dining experiences, these dishes are meant to make sense and not keep you guessing.
