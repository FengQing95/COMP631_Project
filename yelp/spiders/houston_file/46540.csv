Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just came here for a little brunch moment and loved it! I got the kids grilled cheese and the strawberry chocolate passion and both were delicious. My brother had the kids chicken strips and my mom had the burger with parmesan fries and they loved it as well. The kids meals were pretty big and filled me up! Also the owner was super nice and gave us a free hot chocolate! Customer service was great and so was the food! Definitely will be back.
