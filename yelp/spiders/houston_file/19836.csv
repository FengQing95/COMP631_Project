Uchi////I visited Uchi in Houston recently and it did not disappoint.  Make a reservation in advance.  This is the hot spot, and the joint was jumpin' when we got there - no way you'll eat until 11p if you don't have a reservation (we were a group of 6).  Might be fun to eat at the sushi bar if you're a couple though...
