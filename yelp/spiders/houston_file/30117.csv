The Pit Room////Best bbq in the Houston area. And among the best I have ever had including Austin, New Braunfels and Lockhart joints. I typically go for brisket moist, sausage, potato salad and beans so I cannot speak to the ribs until I try em. This place is worth a pretty long drive if youre looking for the good stuff.
