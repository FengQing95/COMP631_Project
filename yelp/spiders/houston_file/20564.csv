Uchi////One of my favorite restaurants, I'm here several times a month and still love it.  This is not your standard Japanese restaurant, if you want something safe and cheap this is not your place.  If you are open to creative, unconventional dishes, thoughtfully and carefully constructed then you'll probably like Uchi.*
