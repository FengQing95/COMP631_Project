Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The pig candy was very good. The pork belly was soft and not too sweet but it wasn't melt in your mouth consistency. The beef short rib was as good as we expected. Not every bite was tender but it was the flavor was spot on. Pickles and vegetables consisted of pickled carrots, cauliflower and big okra for $5. Should come as a free side if your order an entree.
