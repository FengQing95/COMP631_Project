Uchi////Make a reservation and check Uchi out for yourself! Tasted everything on the social menu, hama chili, brussel sprouts, biendo, and the fried milk for dessert.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!  Sit at the sushi bar, enjoy a great meal and great service.  Could not have asked for a more enjoyable evening....I'm dreaming about my next visit and the Fried Milk!
