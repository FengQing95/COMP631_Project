Uchi////So to be honest I came here to leave a good review. I spent $240 the food was good whatever. I went on 9/28/2020 for my 3 year anniversary & they gave me this $25 off card and said "so you don't have to wait another year to come back" okay super thoughtful until I noticed today 10/3/2020 that the $25 off expired 2 DAYS after they gave it to me. This isn't Mcdonalds. Who goes back two days later to spend that kind of money again.
