Kata Robata////The food here was absolutely PHENOMENAL. We went for my husband's birthday - it's been a life long dream of his to eat here and it most definitely did not disappoint! I, as a non-sushi lover, enjoyed my experience just as much as my husband did with his sushi....and that's certainly saying something.
