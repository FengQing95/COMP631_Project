The Pit Room////Visiting from St. Louis and this place came highly recommended. All I have to say is thank goddess I don't live here in Houston, I would literally never leave this place! Haha. Everything was awesome from beef ribs, brisket, elote, and sauces.. job well done to all the people running this place!!
