Uchi////Our Sushi Chef, Patrick was really nice and helpful. Since it was our first visit, we ordered a 6 course tasting menu which comes with a dessert and 2 extra dishes from the menu. The food was excellent! both of us was so impressed and agreed that the wait is so worth while. The yellow tail literally just melted in your mouth and you will not need any soya sos or wasabi it.
