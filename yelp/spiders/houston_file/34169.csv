Local Foods////Again, it looks really expensive, but won't hurt to come here once in a while. Even though it was a hearty-ish meal, I felt refreshed and not bogged down. If you like hot sauce/sriracha, definitely try their in-house hot sauce. I happen to really like spicy foods, and it help give the sandwich new flavor. And be sure to appreciate the design of the menu and bathe in its clean look.
