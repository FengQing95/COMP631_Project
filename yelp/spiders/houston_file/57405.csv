Kata Robata////This ramen was disappointing. The flavor was too sweet for my liking. Other than the sweetness, there was nothing special about this dish. The pork wasn't exactly fatty, but it wasn't chewy or tough either. I would've preferred the egg to be marinated more because it was slightly bland. I'll pass on this next time.
