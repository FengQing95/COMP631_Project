Baby Barnaby's////Everything was so dirty! The glasses got water literally had like brown cake like stuff on all three of our glasses. The table was dirty. The menus were gross. We didn't get silverware until at least 5 minutes after getting our food and we had to ask. The pancake that I got was good (banana) but it was so dirty inside that I was grossed out. My chicken sausage was burned so one ate that. It just was not a pleasant experience. We went at 8am so it wasn't that busy either.
