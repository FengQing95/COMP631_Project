Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have been disappointed with my experience with the croissants at common bond. The almond and chocolate croissants have been stale and no longer crispy, airy, and flaky like it was originally. Â I can no longer rave about these croissants. I believe the ingredients have been downgraded and yet we still pay a premium for an inferior quality. Please bring the "original" quality croissants back.
