Uchi////This place is spectacular. An excellent vibe, with also a great vegetarian menu as well. The Tarabagani sashimi is absolutely superb and highly recommended. It was simply cooked to perfection with flavors that popped with every bite. The kinoko nabe was a well cooked rice dish as well. For dessert, definitely try the Vietnamese coffee, an excellent combination of condensed milk, mint ice cream, and dark chocolate. Would definitely recommend a stop here!
