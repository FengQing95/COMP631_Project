Baby Barnaby's////If there was a negative star it would be given too much credit. Came here from out of town because it came up as one of Houstons "better" lunch reviews. Came in to a Patio that doesn't distinguish "entrance" ... there wasnt a "wait to be seated" either. There was a door we walked into and I didn't see a hostess.... We walked back on the patio and there was open seating so me and my friend sat down. It was then that an older white man (I would've said gentleman but that would be false and given him too much credit Â ) that said RUDELY " did you sign the clipboard?" ... (I guess you sign yourself in, but not being from here you wouldn't know that). THERE was no greeting... he was dismissive and rude and didn't instruct anything .... you would literally get better customer service at McDonalds. He could've said a fucking HELLO or "Hey guys, it's actually not open seating. You have to sign yourself in and we'll call you when your table is ready. The clipboard is right here!" Definetly wouldn't recommend spending any money here. And the food didn't look good either.
