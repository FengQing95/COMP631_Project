JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got to try both the Tonkotsu Black and White, with the main difference being the broth. Black was thick and flavorful while White was light and smooth. I personally prefer the White more but you won't go wrong with either one. The thin noodles had the right level of consistency and chewiness. And FINALLY, someone in Houston got the chashu right -- flaky, melt-in-your-mouth, chashu. BAM! The rest of the toppings were above average with the soft-boiled egg being the highlight.
