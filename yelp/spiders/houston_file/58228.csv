Kata Robata////Overall, as you can tell, I really loved all of the food. The service was good, however I did have to ask multiple times for our drink orders that seemed to have been forgotten, as well as the ramen that was ordered. In the end, we ended up cancelling the ramen because we finished dinner and dessert, so I'm quite certain the item was missed. Regardless, I will definitely be back here for the food.
