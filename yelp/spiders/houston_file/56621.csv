Kata Robata////I ordered the Spicy Soy Ramen (not on happy hour menu), Agedashi Tofu, Longhorn Roll, and Texas Kobe Yakiniku Roll. The first 3 listed were semi-wins for me. The ramen was in a creamy broth, wasn't spicy, came with thick noodles and the overall flavor was well-balanced. They garnished the ramen with thin red colored ginger slices, which I could've gone without since I felt it overpowered the flavor of the ramen itself. The Agedashi Tofu was good, but I feel it's hard to mess up. It pretty much tastes the same at every other Japanese restaurant I've been to, but I'm a fan regardless. The Longhorn Roll was pretty good flavor-wise, but the size of the sushi was pretty small. I would only get this as a happy hour item, but it's not worth getting at full price. The Texas Kobe Yakiniku Roll was a disappointment. With the fancy name, I was hoping for some fancy flavors. Instead, I got a plain sushi roll that was in need of some seasoning.
