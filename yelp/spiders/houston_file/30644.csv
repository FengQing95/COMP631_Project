The Pit Room////Overrated restaurant at best! Beef rib was nothing but PURE FAT! Brisket was decent at best. The atmosphere is nothing special nor anything more "country"/"Texan" than a Pappas or TX Roadhouse. Besides that point it's a very small restaurant so you'll most likely have to eat outside, we didn't have to but some ppl did on a rainy day of all days. Again very overrated AND & expensive for abysmal food! Very disappointed in Houston and Texas :/
