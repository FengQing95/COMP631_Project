JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is very convenient considering its location (garage parking is close by and there's rarely a wait for weekday lunch), so it was disappointing not to like the ramen. In general terms, the Tonkotsu Black just felt kind of one-dimensional: the broth itself was plenty rich, but the individual ingredients were a bit tasteless. The toppings were a nice touch (especially the egg), but my noodles seemed a bit under-cooked and the chashu pork just didn't taste that good. The lasting impression I got was that I could have prepped a similar bowl of ramen at home, except I dropped $16 on it instead.
