Kata Robata////The decor is fairly stylish and modern, though not very memorable.  It is indeed loud inside, and not terribly intimate.  I was very unimpressed with our server.  He was young and clearly inexperienced - both with this restaurant and with waiting tables in general.  He knew little about the food, nothing about the sake list, and visited us at odd intervals that did not correspond with our needs.  AFTER we ordered our 2nd bottle of sake, which he could tell us nothing about, the bartender/somellier visited us and suggested we order the sake flights next time to taste some high-end sakes at a low price.
