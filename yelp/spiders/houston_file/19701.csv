Uchi////We started our meal off with a nice bottle of Sho Chiku Bai sake from the Takara sake brewery in Berkeley, CA. I visited the factory once during my college days, and liked their sake quite much. It happened to be their cheapest bottle at 15 for 350mL, which was nicely split amongst the four of us in nice wooden box cups.
