JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////-service: the wait staff was awesome! Everyone was attentive and the friend I was with determines good staff by how attentive they are with his water refills. He drinks a lot of water and I'll tell you this, it was like a magic trick because every time his cup hit below the half mark, instantly there was someone there to refill it. I understand that this is one of the things the manager strongly pushes and we love it.
