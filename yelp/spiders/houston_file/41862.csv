Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////now to the important part, food and drinks. both times I came, I opted to get things off their food menu rather than the baked goods they have displaying in their window.... i'm more of a salty food person than sweet.... once I got the breakfast torta and the other time I got a chicken torta. both were amazing!!! they bread was pillowy soft the ingredients were bursting with flavor and both had the delicious crema in the Sammy. these tortas are a good size, so it was definitely enough to fill me up. the first time I went I got the chicken torta with a side of their blue cheese potato salad... yeah it was even better than it sounds... but it was way too much fooded. I almost had my friend roll me out, I was so full. next time I go for lunch, i'll split a torta if I want the potato salad.
