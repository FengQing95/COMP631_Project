JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Solid place for Ramen. Great for hanging out with friends not so much family with little kids. While the atmosphere was conducive the seating is not ideal for little ones because your sitting across strangers. Would be great if they had booths. We made it work out regardless and it's really a minor issue. Regarding the food everything we ordered was excellent. The food made it worth while and made us forgot we had our kids with us. Waitress was wonderful and attentive. Would go again even with the kids!
