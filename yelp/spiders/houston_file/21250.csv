Uchi////What can you say about a place like this that has so much hype and reviews. It was definitely amazing. There are so many different and unique options that the menu was a little overwhelming. So I chose to go the route of getting the 10 dish menu suggested by the chef. Typically, I don't do this, but in this situation, I thought it'd be a good idea and trust these guys. They are artists. So let them dazzle you with their full flavors and shocks to your taste buds.
