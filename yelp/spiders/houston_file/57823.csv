Kata Robata////We ended up here quite by accident and it was a very happy accident. We were celebrating our anniversary and my husband made us reservations at another restaurant. It was not quite what we expected so we bailed and were driving aimlessly wondering where we should eat instead. I remembered people recommended this place to me in the past and we were close so we stopped in. 45 minute wait for a table but there were 2 seats left at the sushi bar so we took those.
