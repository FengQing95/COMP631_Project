JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food aside, the service is pretty hit-or-miss. I've had some great experiences, and some head-scratching ones. The prices are also pretty steep for a ramen place--you'll shell out close to $20 if you add a few toppings--but I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere, which is admittedly pretty dope. At the end of the day, the ambiance and food definitely make Jinya a crowd-pleaser and compensate for the restaurant's shortcomings.
