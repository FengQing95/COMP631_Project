The Pit Room////While in Houston I searched for another Texas Monthly best 50 BBQ places and the Pit Room was near my hotel.  So after checking out I got in the car and followed directions from my map app to guide me through some narrow streets, and finally made it there right after 11:00 AM (when the open).
