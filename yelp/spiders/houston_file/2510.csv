JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Patricia - Thank you for your great review. We agree, the wait time can be a bit loathsome, but in the coming months, we will open two more JINYA locations which, hopefully, will alleviate some of the congestion at Midtown. We'll see. In the meantime, thank you for bearing with us.
