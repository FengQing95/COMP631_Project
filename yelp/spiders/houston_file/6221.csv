JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Throughout the year, ramen shops have been popping out of no where, allowing customers to experience the hype. I must admit, I am a ramen fanatic, but have yet to had a bowl of ramen that has satisfied my taste buds. This particular ramen bar was no different if anything worse. A couple of friends and I decided to try this place out on a Saturday night. THAT WAS OUR BIG MISTAKE. Upon walking in, we were pushed into a crowd of waiting customers and told that there was a 45 min wait. Deciding to be patient, we noticed the majority of customers were Asian, just like us, probably because Asians love their ramen! The restaurant gave off a dark ambient lighting with modern decor and deep house music. You could tell that they were shooting for that up-scale lounge type feel. After our 45 min wait, we were finally seated in an open, rectangular bench in the middle of the restaurant that took away the intimate vibe. You were literally sitting next to strangers and could clearly hear their conversations. After ordering our food, we waited another 25-30 min.. it seems most the time at the restaurant was spent waiting..
