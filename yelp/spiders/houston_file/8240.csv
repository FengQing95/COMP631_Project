JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We've come back several times now and like other reviewers have said, it's best to start off with Jinya #1 for newcomers or with Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers like me. Just be aware that the thick noodles for the Cha Cha Cha can be a bit heavy, so bring your appetite or stick to Jinya #1 if you're a light eater. As for appetizers, you definitely can't go wrong with the takoyaki (a definite crowd favorite) or with the crispy shrimp balls (MY favorite as the breading reminds me of the crunchy Japanese cracker snacks we used to eat on the islands).
