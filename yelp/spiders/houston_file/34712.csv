Local Foods////This place serves tasty and healthy food. My husband had the quinoa burger and I had the banh mi. The line was super long when we got inside the door. I have now been to several Local Foods. There's always a line. The food is pretty consistent and one of the healthier options compared to other restaurants. Because of the long lines and limited menu options, I don't frequent this place often.
