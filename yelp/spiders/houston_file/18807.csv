Uchi////We opted for the 10 course omakase, which changes day to day. Last night's tasting featured lots of raw fish and scallops (my favorite). The food is what I would call smart and modern. Because most dishes have some sort of raw component, every piece of ingredient contributes to a specific taste. You can really taste the thought and creativity in each dish. Honestly, that's really the way to eat. Too often we eat in huge bites and barely taste our food. Uchi is an adventure for the taste buds. If you're just here to stave off hunger, then you've wasted a meal.
