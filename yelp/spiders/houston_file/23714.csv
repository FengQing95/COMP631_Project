Uchi////Fifty five minutes later, we got a very average sushi roll. I don't know it was the waiters fault or what but we waited almost an hour for a spicy tuna roll that had been fried in oil. It was good but by the time we left at 6:45 (an hour and a half after we arrived), we'd had 4 tiny plates and were still hungry.
