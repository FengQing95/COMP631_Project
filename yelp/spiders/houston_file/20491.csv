Uchi////Wow.  Just wow!  Daniel Son was just great.  My wife and I always get the Vegan tasting and have always been surprised at what comes out.  Do not expect American sized portions.  This is a nicer place and it is much more artisan style.  I have always left full with all things considered.  I have come for no reason and also special occasions.  Will always come back.
