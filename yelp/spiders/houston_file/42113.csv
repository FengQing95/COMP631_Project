Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////(a little pricey for a cookie but worth it). The macaroons are also delicious, I didn't favor the chocolate croissant- it was just ok. I usually come here and pick up some pastries and then head over to agora for coffee as the coffee here has a distinct taste to it and I don't quite like it. Alot of good stuff to choose from here if you have a pastry craving.
