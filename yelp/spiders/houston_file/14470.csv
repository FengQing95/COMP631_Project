JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Unfortunately the ramen was a different story. Mine was ok although it was not very hot. I felt the broth needed more pork flavor and I wasn't a fan of their straight noodles. Plus since it wasn't very hot my extra noodles has a hard time coming apart when I put them in the broth.
