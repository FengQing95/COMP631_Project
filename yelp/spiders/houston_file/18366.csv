Uchi////Due to Uchi's location, parking spaces are like the Hope Diamond, it exists, but good luck ever thinking you will possess it. Uchi does provide complimentary valet parking due to the lack of street parking available, but complimentary still means that you end up paying a tip, so it's really not complimentary. The valet is in the back behind Uchi, making it not exactly curb side valet service.
