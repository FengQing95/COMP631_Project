JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came over the weekend with my girlfriend. I got Tonkutsu Black HOT, and it was great. Beware - HOT means HOT, unlike most places in Houston. I haven't had much ramen in my life, but I really enjoyed this. The atmosphere was very cool, the wait staff was prompt and attentive, and the food was awesome.
