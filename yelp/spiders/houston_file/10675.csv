JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We also had the Jinya Bun (3/5).  Nothing really special about it.  Pork was cooked well but wish it came with some kind of slaw instead of lettuce and cucumbers.  The fried octopus ball (Takoyaki) 3/5 was also just average.  Not enough Octopus in it.  We ended our meal with the Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream (4/5)  Green Tea flavor really came through and texture was good just how it's supposed to be.
