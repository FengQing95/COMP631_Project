The Pit Room////OMG, i can honestly say this is the best brisket i have ever ordered from a barbecue spot.  When ordering the brisket, they had the lean present to be cut and weighed.  I ask them if i can get the fatty part of the brisket.  The guy ran back to the smoker and pulled out a new brisket and cut me the fatty part of the brisket.  Delicious, moist, tender, and very peppery.
