Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Drinks are lovely, service was wonderful, and the food was amazing. The whiskey lover will be so excited to see a room devoted to whiskey. My vegetarian heart was so excited to find a black eyed pea sandwich and my carnivore husband enjoyed his burger. The Mac and cheese was amazing, the fries are HUGE. Happy hour specials are a pretty good deal, however nothing for vegetarians on the happy hour menu. We also loved the tomato salad. My only complaint is the music is a bit loud for good conversation.
