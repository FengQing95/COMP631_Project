JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In addition, JINYA is a nationwide-franchise concept that has specific aesthetic and operational standards we must follow. Moreover, since the beginning of this year, the food-service and hospitality industry has been facing supply-chain issues affecting not only our ability to source specialty-imported food items, but also nearly every aspect of our operations from wine and liquor to cleaning supplies. This, unfortunately, has helped to drive prices higher in nearly every category of our business.
