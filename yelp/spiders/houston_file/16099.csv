JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Jaloni - Thank you for your review. We're sorry you had a bad experience at our restaurant recently. We appreciate the feedback, though, and we have taken this opportunity to discuss this with our staff member in question. Please know that we are trying our best, but sometimes the stress does get the better of us -- not that it's an excuse. It goes without saying that these are perhaps the most trying times since we opened our doors in 2015, but with patience and understanding on both sides of our counter, we'll get through this together.
