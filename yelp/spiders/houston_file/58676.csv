Baby Barnaby's////LOVE Baby Barnaby's! The food is amazing--Migas, Apple Pecan Pancake, Breakfast plate and more!  It's a pain on the weekends--too crowded, but perfect if you can manage a weekday breakfast/brunch.  Fast and friendly service, great coffee, and good food make me a many times over return customer.
