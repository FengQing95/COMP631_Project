Uchi////we told our waiter that we're thinking to do omakase (splurge our birthday girl) then our waiter said he doesn't recommend it because the portions are very small and not very filling so he recommended that he could select very nice dishes for us that'd be better than omakase so we went for it. it's about 16 small sushi courses plus two desserts, they were very good and fresh but not super special and not quite filling so at the end of the 16 savory courses we wanted to order more like a main dish to share then we been told it would be at least an hour wait from the sushi bar and same for the kitchen, I was shocked but felt it's in a soft way saying don't order anything more you're done finish the dishes and leave so they can have it for the next round customers, its quite systematic so it can turn tables 2,3 rounds per night.
