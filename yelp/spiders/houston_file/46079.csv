Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Atmosphere-wise was modern and a little loud, but really your traditional upscale bakery environment. They have spacious tables and the usual coffee/tea/beverage service. We didn't try the savory foods, but they looked great. I should plan to look at that menu more closely next time. Would definitely come back for some pastries and breads to go, also! Â
