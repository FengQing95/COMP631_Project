JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've never really been a fan of ramen places but JINYA is making think that the other places I've been to have just planed sucked. JINYA's environment is absolutely modern and chill. There isn't too much seating and that might be the reason it gives off a lively however, the customer service is amazing. They're incredibly kind and fast.
