Local Foods////I got the crunchy chicken sandwich because I saw previous yelpers claiming that it was amazing and I must agree!! It was a really good and fresh sandwich. It was crunchy and fresh and just plain AMAZING! It was such a big sandwich that I could only finish half of it. I also got potato chips were just ehhh and cabbage slaw, which was really good! There were edamame beans in it and it was really different, but a good different. I will definitely come back a second time and try their other items on their menu.
