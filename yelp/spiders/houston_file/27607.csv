The Pit Room////My boss brought me here the other day . I would give it a five star cause the BBQ was finger licking good ! And I mean finger licking . But I have to knock off one star cause the lemonade was out and they didn't have any silver ware rolled up. And ice machine was empty it was near closing time I'll give them that will definitely be back because that barbecue were so good.
