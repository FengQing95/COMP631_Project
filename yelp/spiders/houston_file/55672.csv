Kata Robata////Our server Andy was the sweetest. He truly made this experience amazing. I really think great service makes an experience 10 times better. He was very detailed and made sure we were well taken care of. We didn't have to wait on anything and things came out in perfect order. We came for lunch and ordered Yuzu Salmon Carpaccio, 2 pieces of anago sushi, fresh catch ceviche, spicy soy ramen, Japanese amberjack sashimi with foie Gras, and the Texas Hamachi sushi roll. Everything was delicious, except we weren't a huge fan of the ramen. It was good, but different from what we like in terms of ramen. Definitely recommend and will be coming back soon!
