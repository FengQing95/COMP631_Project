Kata Robata////I'm very disappointed with Kata Robata: 1) Menu price increased over 10% during the Covid pandemic 2) Curbside waited for 40 minutes after the promised time (food ordered online 6:05 PM , promised time was 6:35 PM. Food was finally delivered to my car 7:15 PM). I never received an apology 3) I lost an objet there so I walked back to a table where I was originally seating and a client was extremely nice and tried helped me to find the lost object Â (first I asked for permission). Kata Robata Manager was extremely rude and also said that I was scaring the client, when in fact the client has offered to help me. I felt very uncomfortable and sad with the manager. I have been going to Kata since 2009 almost on a weekly basis and I will never come back again. My friend also will not come back again. Enough is enough.
