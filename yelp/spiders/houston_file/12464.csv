JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Finally tried Jinya after hearing all of the ranting and raving. Interior was nice and clean little Japanese esq. Got the pork ramen and the takoyaki. In my opinion the takoyaki tasted better than the ramen. The ramen wasn't that bad but it wasn't all that great either. To me it didn't live up to the hype. Waiters were friendly but the way time can get long as it is in downtown and the lunch rush is insaneeee. We waited for about half an hour to be seated but the food was worth it, though not as good as I thought it would be.
