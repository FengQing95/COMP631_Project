Baby Barnaby's////Ordered French Toast with scrambled eggs and a sausage while my bf ordered the Waffles with over easy eggs. The French Toast was a bit bland but the sausage and syrup made it more appetizing. The Waffles were pretty good though. We ended up not finishing either of our plates because there was too much carbs going on lol.
