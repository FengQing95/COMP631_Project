JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Well the soup is just out of the world. Love the flavor of the soup. Ramen wasn't entirely  curly (like those packet ramen) but more like a mix of straight noodles and curly ramen. I like them but I just wish they were a bit more curley hehehe. Chicken quantity was more on the left side of the scale. I am not a big fan of chicken and I don't eat pork. So basically had very few options to chose from. Oh forgot to mention our wait staff was super nice and helpful.
