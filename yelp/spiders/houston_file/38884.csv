Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Second time I've been for brunch. The mimosas were just so so but that's typical when you get a carafe. I ordered shrimp and grits (entree) fries (app). The fries were bomb! But I did want them before my food and they came after. Nonetheless, they were eaten lol. I'm a potato girl so they were tasty to me! Thick wedges, crispy on the outside and soft inside. Â
