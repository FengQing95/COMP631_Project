JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's interesting that you found our Cha Cha Cha to be less flavorful than the Tonkotsu Black. From our experience, most customers have found the opposite to be true. Regardless, just for future reference, if you ever feel that something we offer is not 100% to your satisfaction, just tell your server and we will do everything we can remedy the situation. Also, I have just this evening notified all the servers to readjust how they prepare the Annin Tofu dessert. I agree, they very often add too much whipped cream which can take away from the more subtle almond flavor of the pudding.
