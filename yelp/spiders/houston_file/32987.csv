Local Foods////Honestly, I'm not too big of a sandwich guy, but this place hits the spot. With a hipster/modern interior, the restaurant itself has a very nice vibe and feel to it. The portions are adequate for the price you pay, as each sandwich comes with 2 sides. All the sides are healthy and delicious - my favorites include the quinoa, acorn squash, and the cole slaw. Try them all though! Maybe even ask for some samples because they'd be more than willing to let you taste test them.
