Uchi////The only let down (minor) of the whole experience was a beef tongue daily special Â (satodzuke no gyutan). I'm a beef tongue fan but it just wasn't a great as the other dishes we had that night. The server noticed this since we didn't finish the dish and prompty told us if we didn't think it was awesome it'd be taken off the tab. Plus he asked our opinion on what could've been done better. Can't beat that especially since none of us made a verbal complaint about it. Also I had dessert comped since it was a special occassion. Need to find another excuse to eat here again very soon!
