JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For an "authentic" ramen shop the prices are of course higher than the kind in plastic packs you buy in bulk out of the supermarket when you are riding the struggle bus until the wheels fall off - but they are in the same price range or cheaper than the other hipster congregations. The cheapest ramen offering is the veg one ringing up at $9.80 but the crowd favorites are in the $11-13 range (tonkotsu spicy at $11.80) as a base before you add in the other stuff for a few bucks a throw for an egg, chicken soboro, or more.
