Local Foods////The duck confit was pretty good, but not the best I've had. The bread of the sandwich really took away from the meat, which wasn't as juicy as I thought it would be. The house smoked salmon was a glorified lox & bagel. The gulf shrimp & blue crab was slightly sweet, but that was all the flavor I could gather from it... I couldn't taste the shrimp or crab! It's like all the flavor was drawn out and replaced with a sweet dressing.
