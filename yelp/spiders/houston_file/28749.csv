The Pit Room////Fast and fresh bbq that's a level up from Rudy's. You get in line and order what you would like and they'll cut up the meat and serve your sides right away.  The spot is a little cramped and there's always a good crowd here.  I got 1/2 lb of pork ribs and sides of mustard potato salad and cucumber tomato salad.  The cucumber tomato salad is really good but I do tell you that they use really huge slices of cucumbers that are more than a mouthful.  The pork ribs came with the bbq sauce on the side but it had a dry rub seasoning already.  The rib came right off the bone without much effort on my end and the flavors were great but I'm more of fan of bbq sauce glazed ribs.  The habanero sauce is the way to go with the ribs.  Mustard potato salad was good but nothing too special about it. My boyfriend got the brisket taco which looked amazing.  I would come here for a bbq fix.
