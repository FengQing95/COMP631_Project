Kata Robata////Ok for Houston sushi. Fish is good but rice was a little hard. I have a high standard for sushi so take it for what it's worth. Good for the atmosphere and for the average sushi go-er. Non-sushi items are pretty good; had the buta no kakuni: really good flavor and braised well (8/10).
