Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Get ready- I'm about to throw out a superlative--- Common Bond makes the best kouign amann I have EVER had. It is the perfect balance of flaky, buttery layers with a sugar coated crisp bottom. It would also qualify as one of the best pastries I've ever had in general. The cherry on top is the window on the side of the building where you can watch the magic happen behind the scenes.
