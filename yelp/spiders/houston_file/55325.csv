Kata Robata////Wish I could give it more than five. Everything about our meal here was amazing. Service was perfect. The fish was fresh and varied. They had many options that are not common or easy to find. The atmosphere was clean and cozy and fancy. They have a good selection of beer, wine, champagne, and sake. Will definitely be going back.
