Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As far as the quality goes, the coffee was good. When you're dealing with semi automatic machines, consistency is more difficult...but my Cortado was great! I definitely recommend this place for a quick stop or as a hangout for some dessert pastries and a coffee.
