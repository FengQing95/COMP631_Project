Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Quick note on atmosphere, if you like the night life and socializing environment this is the place. I think the target audience is 25-55. It had a very nice mixture and I can see nobody felt out of place here. They had a DJ, I believe a DJ comes Friday, Saturday and Sundays for brunch. But anyway, everyone was grooving, socializing and truly enjoying themselves. Some people were standing around near the bar. Gives you a mix vibe of midtown/ a chill spot combined. Kind of noisy but nothing obnoxious just a lot of socializing.
