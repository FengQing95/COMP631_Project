Uchi////My very favorite restaurant and I mean it! I love absolutely everything I've ordered. The food is so inventive and tasty. Go for social hour and save $. Don't forget the cold, unfiltered sake, served in a beautiful little box. Ps- the decor is natural, modern and beautiful as well. The Houston location is every bit as great as both Austin locations.
