Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wandered in one weekday morning for cappuccino but couldn't resist the macarons. Cappuccino I was surprised was so inexpensive at under $4 and was wonderful. The macarons where very cold and I'm not sure if that is normal or not but they tasted delightful. I had lavender and tiramisu flavor. Will be back when the line is shorter!
