Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////If you are lucky enough to have a lifestyle that permits cafe visits during the day, come here on a weekday afternoon. Lines tend to be long at peak times, such as during Brunch on the weekends. Maybe it's in my head, but I feel bad for taking my time with the line of other patrons visibly stretching out the door. The place isn't big.
