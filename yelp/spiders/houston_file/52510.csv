Kata Robata////We stopped by here for an earlier New Year's Eve dinner and there was only one other table being occupied so can anyone explain what the slow service was about? Now on to the food because if u give me good food I don't care if your service is non-existent (ie. hole in the wall Asian places). We started with the Oyster Flight which consists of 3 oysters, one topped with uni, another with a grapefruit salsa, and finally a cucumber pur√©e of some sort. Even with the toppings they tasted fishy and just not too fresh. The highlight of this dish was the nice fatty yellow piece of uni. Now on to the lobster Mac and Cheese, where's the lobster?! Don't get me wrong it's good but there was all but few tiny pieces of lobster in the entire dish? We also had the ramen, it was just so so, nothing special and the noodles tasted like ramen out of a bag at the supermarket, no bounce whatsoever. Finally we ordered the miso crusted bone marrow and there was about enough marrow to cover a half of a half of a piece of toast. Not even a full tablespoon of marrow in the entire dish.
