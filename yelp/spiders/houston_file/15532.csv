JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Yum! I enjoyed the ramen at JINYA. I got the sprouts ramen with Brussels sprouts and it was tasty. It definitely has an Americanized feel to it though. Pretty different from the ramen we had in Japan. I didn't realize this restaurant was a chain, either. It must be a west coast thing because we found the location in Los Angeles randomly, shortly after visiting here! Â
