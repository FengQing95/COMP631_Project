JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: I came here for lunch by myself thinking that my second visit was just an off day and that I would experience the same fabulous ramen I got the first time. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen again and it was back to little flavor and the taste was off. I ate a little and packed up the rest thinking my taste buds were off. An hour later I was sicker than a dog. Stupid me thought, maybe I am coming down with something. So a few hours later, after I felt better, I thought I would have some more broth that would make me feel better. WRONG: bam, sick again and $25 wasted in the trash. I swore I would never go back and avoided all ramen until today.
