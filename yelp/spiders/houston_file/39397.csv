Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went here on a Saturday for date night. I was expecting a place where they play live music and kind of a club/lounge atmosphere. It's more of a sit down restaurant, but maybe we were there a little too early in the evening (around 9PM). We ordered drinks first, "the bosslady" and "lush life" cocktails per the waitresses suggestion. Bosslady was great, and I ended up getting a second. The "lush life" was just ok, too sour for me.
