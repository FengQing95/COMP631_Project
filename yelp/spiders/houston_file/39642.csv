Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Everything on the menu sounded delicious. After narrowing it down to 4.. I finally decided to go with the short rib chilaquiles, as recommended by our bartender. And I was completely satisfied and happy. The short rib was flavorful and tender, the egg was perfectly fried, the crunchy corn tortilla with chile and cheese added the perfect texture. The portion size is good for the price - I was super stuffed and didn't get hungry again until late in the night!
