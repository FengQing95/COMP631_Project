JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Linda - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you weren't wholly satisfied with your most recent visit. First and foremost, I will have a word with our host staff, and that one host in particular, to make sure their attitudes are in order when greeting guests. Our hosts are instructed to present themselves in a friendly and hospitable manner at all times, and while I was not present to witness your experience, I do apologize for his behavior.
