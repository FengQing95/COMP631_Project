JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far the best ramen I've had in Houston. I've tried ninja and samurai and they were alright. I got the premium tonkatsu white and it was delicious. Also tried the tempura brussel sprouts. The only negative is it being a little pricey but it's worth it. Growing up in LA I've been looking for a decent ramen place in Houston and I think jinya is it. Definitely will go again!
