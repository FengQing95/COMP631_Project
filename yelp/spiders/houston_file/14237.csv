JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My girlfriend and I took a little mini vacation to Houston during an Easter, and one of the first places we definitely had to try out was Jinya. Both of us are SUCKERS for some good ramen! There are some decent ramen bars in NOLA, but Jinya was something a lot of people were raving about in Houston.
