Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I Ordered the steak and fries and wowww.. wasn't expecting this from a bakery. So much flavor! And the thin fries they come with are a perfect match. It was a group of us so we each got a different dessert to share, my fav was the strawberry shortcake. Super cute place, I just would suggest car pooling... lol.
