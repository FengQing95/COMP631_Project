JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: We ordered quite a few appetizer items. They were all good. My favorite was the Spicy Creamy Shrimp tempura. For the ramen, I loved my Spicy Tonkatsu soup. The Pork Chashu that came with the Ramen was awesome, and the broth was unbelievable. Each of us also paired the the ramen with  either rice bowl or gyoza.  The Chicken Chashu rice bowl was  also good.
