Kata Robata////A majority of the rolls have mayonnaise, avacado, or cream cheese in them, which I personally think is disgusting and not something you would find in a substantial portion of rolls in a high quality sushi restaurant anywhere other than Houston. (For example - Uchi does not have cream cheese or mayo in ANY of the rolls). I really do not like the flavor combinations that are thrown together in the rolls. They are not complimentary to the actual fish.
