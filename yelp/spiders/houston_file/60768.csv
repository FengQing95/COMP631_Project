Baby Barnaby's////I ate here with my two small children for breakfast. The fresh squeezed orange juice was refreshing and both of my children loved it. I had the corn beef hash which was perfectly good. It was cooked perfect but I was more interested in the blueberry pancake I got for the children. It was one of the best, if not the best, pancake I have eaten. It was golden and crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft in the center. The pancake had a slightly sweet finish that I really enjoyed and kept my fork finding it's way back for more.
