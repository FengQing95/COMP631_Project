Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was very good. (I ordered the popular pig candy and was not at all disappointed haha. The steak, too, was cooked very well.) Cocktails were alright - a little too strong imo. One thing that took a full star away from this review was the extremely-loud environment. I could hardly hear my date and practically had to scream at him before he could make out what I said.
