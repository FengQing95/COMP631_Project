JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I wish this place was more convenient to go to, because it's easily one of my favorite ramen spots. Though it looks like they changed the menu since I've been last, it seemed like there were less ramen options than when I came the last time. The ramen I got seemed pretty unassuming to me at first but before I knew it, my bowl was empty. This is definitely a social place. If you come alone and don't want to be seated next to a stranger at the long table, you may want to try to get a seat at the bar. It's kind of loud, and it's consistently crowded, but the ramen is easily one of the best in Houston.
