Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious french pastries and nice atmosphere. Gooey buttery nutella croissant, riff on strawberry shortcake, and triple choc cookie were all very good. Tried the french dip sandwich and burrata sandwich and they too were generously filled, well priced and yummy!
