JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Douglas - Thank you very much for your review. As you might imagine, we have received our fair share of complaints regarding the servers' unified "Irrashai!" as each party is seated. Please allow me to explain: This is an integral part of our corporate culture here at JINYA. As a Japanese company that came to the U.S. more than 10 years ago, JINYA brought many service customs that you will find in Japan today, namely, in almost every business, staff are trained to yell greetings ("Irrashai") to show their enthusiasm and genki spirit. Genki (元気) is a common Japanese word that means "energetic, lively and healthy."
