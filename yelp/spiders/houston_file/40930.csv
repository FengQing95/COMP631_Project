Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In town for just a few days with my boyfriend for a concert and decided to check this place out for a quick bite to eat and a few beers. From the outside looking in, this place seems like more of an upscale bar with lots of business men, but when you walk in everyone is very welcoming and nice. Our waiters name was Sam, he was very kind and offered a few suggestions for casual drinks in the area.
