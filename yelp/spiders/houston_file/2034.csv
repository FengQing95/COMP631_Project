JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place! Let me start by saying that I absolutely loathe Brussels sprouts! However, after hearing the argument about how good the tempura B. sprouts in Jinya were, I gave in and tried them...... O.M.G. DELICIOUS!! I also got the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and it's fantastic!!! Portions were big for me so I took my leftovers home and got to eat it all again for dinner. This is the only place in town that I'll eat ramen!
