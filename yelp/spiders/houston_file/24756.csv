Uchi////Ordered omakase the other time. I have to admit this could very well be the top Japanese restaurant in Houston, but don't expect the omakase to be anything like those in Japan. 4 star is just the food didn't meet my expectations after seeing so many good reviews and that amount of money we paying. There were 1 or 2 courses were really weird to my taste, i.e. with chili oil or some salmon with kiwi.
