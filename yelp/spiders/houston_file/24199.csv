Uchi////I've had great experiences both times I've dined here. When I reserve on open table they actually take note of that and try to seat you at the same spot (I think). I love the yellow tail, I would recommend avoiding the rolls and just ordering anything and everything else (a couple dishes from each section of the menu) They're Sake Social (happy hour) menu is really great. They brought out a dish that we didn't order and let us have it on the house anyway, and they gave us a dish on the house for absolutely no reason! The service here is awesome, and you can ask any of your servers for recommendations if you're new to these menu items. Or you can try their omakase which is their fixed price chef's tasting menu.
