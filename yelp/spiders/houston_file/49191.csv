Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The convenience in payment stood out to me as there was no wait time on waiters to come back with cards. We just followed the prompts on the device which was brought to our table Â to complete our payment, and we were able to leave with ease. Overall, I would come back to Snooze on a day where I was in the city and needed a satisfying breakfast or brunch.
