Uchi////The nigiri and sashimi are to die for. The uni (sea urchin) disintegrates into briny nectar on your tongue, the unagi (eel) is soft and sweet, and the hotate (scallop) is delicate and smooth. I anxiously await the day I can reasonably afford the omakase, the multi-course chef's tasting. The servers are very knowledgeable about the dishes, although they can sometimes come across as hurried and robotic. Uchi definitely runs like a well-oiled machine when it's busy. Take your time and savor every bite!
