Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Eating macarons in Paris felt special like cigarettes indoors. Men in turtlenecks in yellow lit bars, smoking, arguing about what? Not even they were sure. Then, Laduree opened a million locations in NY, and how drab NY can be with a Pret-a-Manger on every other block. Their subway delays and dirty snow. Yuck. So God save Common Bond for their less pretentious fare in Texas. Ample butter. No tacit ex-girlfriends. Stellar croissants.
