JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came for lunch was pleased walking away, Ramen here is 2nd to none, I had the black bowl and that hit the spot. The noodles were freshed, the broth was well seasoned and with the right amount of thickness. Â I would definitely come back, the only thing is they're a bit heavy on your pocket where a bowl runs around $12-$13 range.
