Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We got a banana brioche and a chocolate chip cookie, both of which were quite delicious. The chocolate chip cookie was one of those good kinds, with crispy edges but a gooey, melty chocolate inside. I also got an iced cappucino, which came in a tall glass but was only filled halfway (they intentionally only fill half the glass, but I think visually you would feel like you got your money's worth if it was a full cup).
