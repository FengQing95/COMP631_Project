Uchi////fried milk (3/5)- agh, i was looking forward to this dish. maybe i set my expectations too high? I thought it was just average. when eating the fried condensed milk, the corn flakes became very stiff and hardened while i was chewing it. the ice milk was too bland and while eating all the ingredients in one bite, the ice milk became overpowered and ended up tasting like... ice. i enjoyed the chocolate mousse in the middle. It had a great consistency and wasn't too sweet either. next time, i think im going to try the lime cremeaux.
