Local Foods////For sides, we had the kale and chips. The chips were way too crunchy for my liking. The kale was very good. I already love kale, so I knew I'd probably like it. It has just the right amount of tang/sweet balance. We also got the Posole soup. It wasn't piping hot, just warm, but I loved the balance of flavors. A simple home-y soup.
