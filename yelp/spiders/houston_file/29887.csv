The Pit Room////Went here on the advice of fellow yelpers. Definitely busy...so much so that they were out of the Brisket. I ordered the ribs, baked beans and potato salad. Ribs were good, not great, but good. Potato salad had mustard in it, which I love, giving it a tangy kick. Sauces were good. As I was finishing up, they got more brisket and I went up and asked to taste it. They gave me a couple of pieces and that was very good. I would go back to try other meats.
