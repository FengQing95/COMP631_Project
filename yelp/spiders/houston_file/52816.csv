Kata Robata////Sushi and sashimi was delicious and SO fresh. We sat at the sushi bar & watched our food prepared & we were extremely pleased to see how the chefs handled all of the fish. Food safety seemed to be a top priority here and going here you will get the freshest, highest quality fish. Presentation of the food was beautiful and each piece was amazing. It was so great we went two days in a row. The first day we shared the "Chirashi" sashimi sampler- yum! Every piece was delicious. It was so good we came back the next day and had the spicy salmon roll, the salmon & soft shell crab roll and several pieces of sashimi & again everything was delicious. Will be back many times!
