Baby Barnaby's////It was our first time here and the introduction was horrible. The hostess did not acknowledge us even though we spoke to her. There was a sign in sheet, but it was in her hand so I spoke to her again and told her that it was our 1st time here and that we didn't know what to do. She finally spoke back and said "just sign in" then she put up the clipboard. We reached right back to pick up the clipboard and sign in then later she saw some people that she knew and got so excited and gave them a hug and greeted them. They arrived after us and she signed them in and covered her face with the clipboard so we couldn't see and promptly let them in to sit at the next available table while we were left standing for 25 more minutes, even though they arrived after us. This place has HORRIBLE Â CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! The woman at the door needs extreme training in customer service. Everyone should be greeted, not just your friends.
