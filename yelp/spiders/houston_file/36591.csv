Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food here is amazing! I've been for dinner and just recently brunch for my boyfriend's birthday! They were so accommodating all throughout brunch! Excellent service, they didn't fuss about splitting the check by couples (like so many places do), they put candles on the bday cake I brought, even stored the cake for us and cut and served it to us! Again, amazing service! The environment is great too, especially on a nice day! Thank you, Bosscat for making my boyfriend's bday a great one! we will be back!
