Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let me say their breakfast food is by far one of the best !!! The French toast is a must ! Also the eggs Benedict! Also their pancakes ! I have tried a lot of different dishes and I have loved all of them. It is like you can't go wrong. The service is great. I only come in during weekdays. I tried coming in on a Sunday and the wait was two hours so... nope. Also expect parking to be a little difficult but very worth it at the end !!! We have gotten lucky on Tuesday and parked right in the front.
