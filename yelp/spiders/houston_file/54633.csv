Kata Robata////Still love this place because the food is so good but the service is atrocious. We were made to wait for a table at lunch time (2:30) when there were a dozen open tables. Saving on servers at these prices?? Then when asked about their WiFi the exclamation was: 'we don't have WiFi!' As I stared at the Kata Robata WiFi spot on my phone. . That's fine but just be forthcoming. It's terrible to have a lovely lunch for $112 for 2 and leave annoyed.
