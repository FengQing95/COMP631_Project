Uchi////Anyway, we're glad we tried Uchi once, no waiting, no small potions or big price complaints (just see it like tapas or dimsum so you won't find the small dishes bothering). But it's definitely not Japanese or fusion Japanese to us which is very disappointed (we've been to some popular cities in Japan and have tried many good Japanese restaurants).
