Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Hi, Ida, thank you for your review.  We are sorry about the loud music volumes today.  We did address this with the staff and asked them to be aware of occupancy levels and to find a good balance throughout the day.  We hope you will join us again and do not hesitate to reach out to a manager while dining if you need to.   Thank you, again!
