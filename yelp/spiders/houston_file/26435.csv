The Pit Room////Consistently good bbq, with some solid sides as well. Brisket was excellent, though just on the dry side, turkey is moist and flavor-packed. Pulled pork is good as well. Sausage was kind of a miss. Not a huge fan of their sauces, but they are not bad either. The okra side was surprisingly well-done, salty, garlicky and not mushy. Charro beans were flavorful. Nice space.
