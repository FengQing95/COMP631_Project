Kata Robata////EVERYTHING WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, FINGERLICKING GOOD. I kid you not. FOR DRINKS definitely ask for the Summer Sunset... made and concocted by our amazing server actually. It's a refreshing oolong tea drink with notes of passion fruit & citrus with rum. Thank you Kata for the amazing experience.. ahh we will definitely be back again next time we're in town!!!
