JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The best in Houston, however this still falls short of the best ramen in Texas to Tatsuya in Austin. The pork broth here is seasoned well and is good but lacks the full depth of other ramens. My Indian friends love this place's chicken ramen and vege ramen and highly recommend it as their best option in Texas.
