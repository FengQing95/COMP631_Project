Local Foods////Menu: This place is known for their crunchy chicken sandwich for a reason. The sandwich is a cross between a chicken salad and a grilled chicken sandwich, imo. I love both, as well as good, fresh bread so I enjoy it. I will caution you to the portion size: be ready to commit to something that requires quite the appetite.
