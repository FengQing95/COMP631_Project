Baby Barnaby's////Tiny tiny place on the corner. Street parking really sucks. Came for weekday breakfast. Inside has tight seating (you can hear your neighbors' conversations) and little seating. Very cozy. Great customer service great menu. Delicious. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with bacon and coffee with milk.
