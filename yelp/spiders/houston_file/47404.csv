Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was waiting for my friend to arrive anyway, so I passed time at the bar. The Orange Snoozius is everything a morning cocktail should be. It's sweet, and smooth, and polite... and it also means business. I also tried the Palimimosa and that was just dreamy. It tastes like that midspace between dead asleep and waking up on your own time, on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Just delightful.
