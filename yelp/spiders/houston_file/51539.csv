Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let me just say the most amazing French toast I've ever had. I ordered the Funky Monkey French Toast which I was skeptical about because i thought it'd be too sweet since it was made with banana bread. However it was the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. My friend ordered the regular French toast which was dry. I also got the grits with shrimp which was wasn't good either. I ended up just eating the shrimp by itself because the grits were tasteless. The mimosas were got were okay as well. I will def go back for the French toast.
