Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The croissants are the most amazing croissants I've had outside of France. You can't go wrong with the plain, chocolate, or almond ones. I have tried several of their tarts and cookies. The chocolate chip cookies are amazing. I loved the oatmeal cookie whoopie pie.
