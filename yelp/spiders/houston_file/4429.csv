JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mathew, Thanks for the review and the constructive feedback. Many guests customize their orders (ie. JINYA Bun, hold the mayo) and we're always happy to fulfill such requests. But, obviously, we will never be able to satisfy everyone 100%. Nevertheless, we take great pride in our food, especially our ramen, so we appreciate it when customers take the time to leave us positive remarks. We look forward to serving you again soon!
