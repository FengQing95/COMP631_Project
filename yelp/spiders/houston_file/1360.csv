JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had never had real ramen in my life until I came to Houston. I tried a few other joints before hand which were pretty good. But one day I tried this place and WOW. I was hooked. I have tried most of their ramen variations on the menu, but nothing beats Tonkatsu Black. The broth is so good and everything mixes in well. The only minor complaint is that I wish there was a little more meat. The chicken appetizer is pretty good too! Desserts are meh, but that's not what you come here for. Best ramen I've ever had in my life!
