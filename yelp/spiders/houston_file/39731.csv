Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The boyfriend and I went back to Bosscat Kitchen & Libations on a Thursday night, hoping to have a change of heart from our last trip. I can safely say that we were BEYOND impressed with the food and the service! The only reason I've knocked off 1 star from what would be a 5 star rating is because it's still really loud, even for a week night. The noise level still gives the impression of a bar that serves food; however, the food definitely says otherwise.
