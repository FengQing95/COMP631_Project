Baby Barnaby's////My fiancee and I were looking for a cool spot to grub before she left Houston and Baby Barnaby's Cafe it was. I looked through the establishment's website, perused it's menu and two things immediately caught my eye: Bob's Healthy Breakfast and The Migas plate. That's exactly what we ordered and everything was superb.
