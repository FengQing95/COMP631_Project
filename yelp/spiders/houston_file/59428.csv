Baby Barnaby's////I sort of dislike the tag "gay friendly" that you see in restaurant listings. It just sounds like "Warning: An inordinate number of gay people go here," and suggests places without the tag are discriminatory. But this Montrose breakfast staple certainly is gay friendly, and boasts several "Best Breakfast" awards from Out Smart magazine. I don't care whether the clientele is white, black, purple, gay, straight, or vampires, Baby Barnaby's makes a damn fine start to your day.
