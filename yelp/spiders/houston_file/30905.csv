The Pit Room////I split a 3 meat plate with a friend. We chose brisket, pork ribs and venison sausage. The venison sausage was superb. Nice amount of peppery spice, not dry and had a smoky flavor. The pork ribs were tasty, but just ok in my opinion. The brisket was a bit salty and nothing to write home about. Our sides were elote and cole slaw. Both sides were fresh and tasty. Â I've had better barbecue, but this place is not bad.
