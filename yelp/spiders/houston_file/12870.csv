JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not perfect, but my favorite ramen place in Houston! I have tried many other ramen places but Jinya is still the best. The broth was very flavorful, but I wish they cut down the salt a little bit. It gets salty as I finish half way. Another highlight is that they have both thick and thin noodles for you to choose. Most other places only have thin noodles, but I prefer thick noodles which are chewier similar to udon texture. The portion is big, I can never finish the whole bowl.
