Local Foods////SO good!! Went for the first time today because of a friends recommendation and it was fantastic. You could tell all the food used fresh ingredients and on the healthier side. I got the truffled egg salad sandwich with sides of kale and tabbouli. The sides were pretty good but not amazing. However, the egg salad sandwich was incredible! It was so tasty and I'm not even the biggest fan of egg salad.
