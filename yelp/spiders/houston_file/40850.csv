Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was a great choice from start to finish! Upon arriving the doors opened exactly at 11am with the manager welcoming everyone in with a smile, warmth and love. We were seated right away and the waiter Ava was amazing from the first hello; she made great recommendations and boy was she right about the cold but warming to the soul BC ice tea! (Yummy) and not to mention the breakfast shot; yes it's a shot of bourbon, oj and bacon on the side! (I know it's a must see and taste to believe) I was seated with a party of 7 and we ordered most of the menu (haha); (the menu is limited.. yup you guessed it due to Covid) anyway; the options available were amazing. We had the pancakes, chicken sausage, burrito, veggie omelette, fruity pebbles French toast, burger and fried chicken and some other stuff... I'm still full and probably won't eat for another day. LoL
