Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food is good but saw one of the blonde white waitress' at the bar drop a cap into the milk before steaming, stick her fingers in it got the cap out and then continue to steam the milk. Instead of just restarting the drink. That was very unsanitary and I feel bad for who's ever drink that was.
