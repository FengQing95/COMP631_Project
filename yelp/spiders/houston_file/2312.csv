JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the Jinya Tonkotsu black which is a pork broth with pork, egg, seaweed, thin noodles, garlic, onions, mushrooms. I added wontons to mine. The second time I went I got the same thing except thick noodles. The egg was cooked perfectly each time. Just slightly runny. My friends got the Spicy chicken and Cha Cha Cha and all of us were raving.
