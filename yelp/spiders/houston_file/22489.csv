Uchi////I was looking forward to taking artsy pictures of the food, but no dice!  The lighting is so low that you really need a DSLR with a fast processor and good auto-focus.  If not, bring a Gorilla Pod.  My Canon EOS M, 50 mm lens on f/1.8, Av, MF could not handle the low light.  It did alright with anything on white plates, but otherwise everything was out-of-focus.  Sad face!  If you are a hashtag-the-struggle-is-real mirrorless photographer like me, sit at the bar.  The lighting is superbly better.
