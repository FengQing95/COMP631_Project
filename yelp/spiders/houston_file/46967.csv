Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great vibe and awesome energy!  The food is phenomenal...  Wow...... it's hearty but still light and not too heavy.  This place is a must for brunch.  Kat is a wonderful server!!!!  Ask for her....  the wait was a bit long but confirms that the food and service is GREAT!!!!
