Local Foods////Still 4 stars. Man this place can get expensive. I went for their salads this time with extra dressing. I ordered the Arugula shrimp salad and it was just refreshing and didn't sit heavy. The shrimp actually had flavor. Very sweet shrimp and they did NOT skimp on the shrimp at all. The mix of sweet and salty from the cranberries and shaved pecorino cheese just tied it all up as one awesome salad. I also tasted my friend's Caphin (Vietnamese coffee). Tasted just like home.
