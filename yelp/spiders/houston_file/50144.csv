Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here this morning for brunch & read on a few blogs it's easy to make this one dish vegan! So I came & gave it a try. The server made it extremely complicated so I felt very uncomfortable.. the food comes out and it does taste pretty good. If you're vegan.. the brovacado can simply be made vegan. The check comes around & she charged me $12.75 when every food blog & other vegan I have talked to says they kindly make the price $9 as almost everything is taken off. I had to speak to a manager but they ended up taking care of it for me... the server just was not helpful at all. On top of it all, the silverware was dirty but after nicely for another set of silverware, I could eat so I'm not too upset about that. My drink order was also completely overcharged as she rang up the wrong drink so it was $12... MORE THAN MY FOOD haha.. I already had to ask to talk to the manager about the bravacado toast so I decided to just let it go and pay MORE money for a drink I didn't get. I give it 3 stars only because I was so hungry but sad they weren't very vegan friendly. Hopefully next time is better because I love brunch.
