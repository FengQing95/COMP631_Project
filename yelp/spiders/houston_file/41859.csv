Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came with my coworker for lunch. I got the salmon tartine, which was delicious! :) The lavendar latte was so pretty - I almost didn't want to drink it! The service was really nice and the waiter was super friendly. My coworker got the korean bbq sandwich and the tomato basil soup.
