Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very good brunch. The wait was super long though... Wish you could make reservations.  Free coffee and games while you are waiting is a plus. Atmosphere is nice and kid friendly. Really enjoyed the food. Highly recommend the pancake trio or Eggs Benedict duo. Chilaquiles Benedict was excellent.  We loved that you don't have to choose and can mix and match flavors. Will definitely go back.
