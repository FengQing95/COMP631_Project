Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////In town for the SeaHawks game. The wife and I jumped in the Uber and what a great choice we made the staff are friendly and knowledgeable about there menus. The martini and old fashioned I got were right on point. The pig candy was full of flavors very impressive. Not just your normal flavors. Wil the bartender was awesome. His suggestion for drinks and food were spot on!
