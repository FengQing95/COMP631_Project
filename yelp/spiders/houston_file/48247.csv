Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love it! Great food, better drinks, fabulous service. Well worth the wait! Get there early so you can get a table--although eating at the bar speeds things up and talking to their bartenders was lovely. Beware, if you come early on Sunday morning they can't serve alcoholic beverages until 10 am due to TX law
