JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I don't come here that often because it's a little too far out from where I live and hate the downtown traffic, but the several times we've come here, the food was always good.  The ramen noodles are nice and chewy, the broth is flavorful.  The takoyaki are my favorites, for sure.
