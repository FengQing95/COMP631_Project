Baby Barnaby's////As far as the food goes, some of the best brunch food I've ever had.  The green eggs are where it's at.  My plate was devoured with the quickness.  It comes with toast, seasoned potatoes which reminded me of jack in the box curly fries but better and in little squares, and a side of sausage.  The sausage was actually very flavorful.
