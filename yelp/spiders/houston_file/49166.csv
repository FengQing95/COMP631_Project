Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait here is kinda long on the weekends but it was well worth the wait! I've been wanting to try this place for so long now and finally got a chance to. I love the break Pot pie here! The crust is flaky and soft. The gravy is perfect, the egg is perfect. Everything about this dish is perfect! Also, their hash brown is so good you don't even need ketchup! I also really like the omg French toast! It really makes you say omg! It's soft, and fluffy! The syrups that they use are different than your normal syrup! I love it! Also, their alcoholic coffee drinks are the best! Perfect for Sunday funday! :) I also got the bacon, egg, avocado, tomato sandwich (BEAT) and although I could make this at home, it was pretty good! Loved the bread they used
