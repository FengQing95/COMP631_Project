The Pit Room////We had some friends from out of town visiting and wanted to take them to some delicious BBQ. We usually go to Gaitlin's or Killen's but both were somewhat of a hike. After reading the existing reviews we came here and were all very impressed! My friend got 3 tacos and said each one was delicious. I got their pulled pork and brisket- it was delicious! Some of the guys got ribs and loved them. The location is convenient if you're in the rice military / montrose areas. I will absolutely come back here and recommend to anyone who loves good BBQ!
