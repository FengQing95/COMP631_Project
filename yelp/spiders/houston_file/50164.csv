Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We also ordered the Benny Goodman, and what a great dish it was! It included smoked salmon, cream cheese, hollandaise, and a wonderfully poached egg. The other eggs benedict dish we ordered was a Benny Duo. We combined an order of the harvest eggs benedict and the chilaquiles eggs benedict. Of the three, my husband and I liked the Benny Goodman the most.
