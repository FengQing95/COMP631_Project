Kata Robata////It's VERY impressive when I order take-out & the restaurant delivers five stars. So this review is based strictly based on how the food tasted and IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS. I got the premium sashimi platter for FOUR people lol & I was able to finish it with my boyfriend. I literally love sushi that much. Every fish was melt in your mouth and so flavorful. I don't even like shrimp but the shrimp was so yummy. I'm literally craving it right now as I'm writing this review. Debating whether I deserve that platter once a month because it'll definitely hurt the wallet if I get it every week LOLOL. I'd recommend & I'd love to experience their dine in service because there's ALOT more that I'd like to order because it all looks so yummy :')
