Local Foods////I should however question the authenticity of their Banh Mi. Maybe it's because I'm spoiled by the offerings of the Cali, B-10, and the 20 other places on Bellaire Blvd. that have Banh Mi's but this was more like a loose meat BBQ pork sandwich on a baguette than a Vietnamese Banh Mi.  Don't get me wrong, it was still fresh and delicious, but simply using a baguette and pickled onions does not a Banh Mi make.
