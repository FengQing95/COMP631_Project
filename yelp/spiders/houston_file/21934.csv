Uchi////I would give this place 10 stars if I could! The best sushi experience I've ever had. Good luck getting a reservation and walk in wait is 1.5 hours. I highly suggest sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the sushi chefs, they make great recommendations I wouldn't have tried otherwise. The ham and egg roll is to die for, the yellowtail with orange was so refreshing, and the brussel sprouts were definitely a hit! Yoshi, the head sushi chef, is so funny and entertaining. Can't wait to come back!
