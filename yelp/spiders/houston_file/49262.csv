Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My waiter was just SLOWWWWWW! I needed creamer for my coffee well I had to get up and get my own. Also, it started raining and we got moved inside of the restaurant and left everything (napkins, silverware, etc... inside) asked her for some new silverware well she never brought it! Once again I got up and got it myself (thanks one waiter that kept being so helpful).
