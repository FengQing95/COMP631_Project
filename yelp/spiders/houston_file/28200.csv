The Pit Room////Secret code for BBQ experts: when you whisper "burnt ends" to the staff at this Texas joint, they know and give you what you need, quite rare and not on the published menu. Go hungry, get a beer and all the sides, do not count the calories, go home with some leftover as an evening snack. Make sure to try any of their special vegetables on the menu when possible. Lines can be long so go off hours or get takeout.
