Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ate here with a group from work recently. The staff was very friendly and I was pleasantly surprised at how attentive the waitstaff were, considering we had such a large group. I had the 12 hour short ribs, which were absolutely delicious. Our table ordered the red velvet churros for dessert, but I think we all agreed we were a little underwhelmed; they weren't really good or bad and the flavor was very hard to describe.
