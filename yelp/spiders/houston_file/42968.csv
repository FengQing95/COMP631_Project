Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came back. This cafe is definitely good, but just want to point out it's not necessarily better than other cute cafes in montrose. And certainly not worth lining up outside before it opens at 9 am on a Saturday (which many people were doing when we inadvertently arrived early this morning). The croissant is flaky, though the outside is a bit too crispy for my tastes. The cappuccino is a bit too bitter, and I like my coffee strong. Hubby got the Moroccan hash - beef was super tender, though probably not my taste for breakfast. The place is a bit loud and hectic. I still prefer Cafe Brasil across the street.
