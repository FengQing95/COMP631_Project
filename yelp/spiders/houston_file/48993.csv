Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Boyfriend and I came in on a Wednesday morning for breakfast, there was a 45 min wait which was acceptable because it was really busy. We tried to get bar seating but someone beat us to it and the barback came over said he would try to save a spot for us which was nice. We eventually got a seat and the bartender was busy with server tickets but as soon she was done she took care of us with water and OJ. Our food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. We got the benny duo, omg French toast, bacon, and sausage links. The bartenders name on the ticket was SIR LOUIS we left very full and happy.
