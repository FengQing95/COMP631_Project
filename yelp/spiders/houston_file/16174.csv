JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA will forever be one of my favorite ramen places. I'm from Denver and we don't really have a great selection of ramen, so every time I'm in Texas, I always make sure that I eat here. We always get the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and the Spicy Tonkatsu. Both are deliciously rich in flavor, but are not overwhelming.
