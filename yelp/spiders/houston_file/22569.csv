Uchi////Let me tell you, ikura is my absolute favorite at any restaurant & the ikura at Uchi has been the best ikura I have ever tasted. Foie nigiri was an interesting concept, I loved it! Bonquerones, not so much. I guess it's just not for me, there was nothing wrong with it. Just personal preference.
