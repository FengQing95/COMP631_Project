Uchi////I recently booked a private party with Uchi in one of their private rooms and I would like to say I am not impressed with their service. I had a party of 10 and we ordered an extensive amount of appetizers, entrees, and dessert. Prior to booking, the event coordinator had mentioned that booking a private room would include a minimum and a set menu to reach that minimum. We surpassed the minimum and then some.
