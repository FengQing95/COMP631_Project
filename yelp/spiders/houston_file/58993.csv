Baby Barnaby's////Not sure why this darling Houston restaurant would be anti-Muslim? Went here with the family for Eid Breakfast on Thursday (a celebration akin to Christmas) bc I love their food and finally convinced them to give it a go with me on Eid day. Apparently, the way we were dressed offended the waitstaff. I wore traditional eastern garb and my fashion was too hot to handle. There were 3 empty tables while we were waiting for the rest of our party of 6 to arrive and also for a bigger table to open up so we could all sit together on their arrival. My husband and I were told to wait outside. I mentioned that it's really hot outside and the waiter said well I have to seat patron at the tables so the only place you can wait inside is to stand there (pointing to an area right in front of the door) - where there was clearly no room. I was put off by what he said but more so by the way it was said. It was clearly derogatory. He was too busy clearing dishes to speak to me directly, more so indicating that talking to me was a waste of time. By the way - no patrons were waiting!!! It was 11:15 AM - 45 mins to closing. Never been more humiliated in my life. Walked out and went to Empire Cafe down the street instead, and they welcomed diversity with open arms!
