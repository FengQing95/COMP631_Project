Kata Robata////Have been here a handful of times but have never been to their HH until last night. It is SURPRISINGLY affordable, especially if it is just you and another person splitting things. We ordered the sprouts, chicken satay, and the salmon carpaccio to start with. All were really delicious and flavorful.
