The Pit Room////This was the one meat(brisket) w/green beans, potato salad. The brisket was delicious, I thought the green beans were different ans very tasteful. I had a sample of the coleslaw and was not a fan. I'm not a huge potatoe salad fan but I would definitely get them again here. A must get for your condiments would have to be the pickles. The flavor of these pickles made me squint my eye slap my thigh and say damn that's some good pickles.
