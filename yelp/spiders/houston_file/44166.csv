Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond croissant & latte: the size of the croissant is humongous and it is super satisfying :) I love how it's flaky and crispy on the outside. The croissant is done right without being too sweet. It was best enjoyed with a cup of latte, which was also very good!
