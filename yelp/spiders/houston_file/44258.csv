Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I would award 100 million stars if I could. They just hit bulls eye after bulls eye; killin' it on EVERY front. If there was any weakness in their desserts, I failed to find it. Â Houston, our bakery game just got taken to a whole new level. Common Bond is a true blessing.
