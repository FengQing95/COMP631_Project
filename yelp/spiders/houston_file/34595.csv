Local Foods////The Village location (nearest me) plays the most God-awful (synth-pop) music most of the time, and it's way too loud. The Upper Kirby location is a little better. To me, music should be way in the background, at least when we eat, and preferably non-verbal. Pop lyrics are just too inane.
