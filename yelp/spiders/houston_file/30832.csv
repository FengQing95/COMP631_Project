The Pit Room////Decided to have lunch at the pit room today with some coworkers.  I ordered a wagyu beef rib and a brisket taco.  I can't say enough good things about the taco.  The rib on the other hand was mostly FULL of fat.  From a ratio perspective, there was more fat than edible meat.  At the price point for the beef rib, this is huge disappointment.  My coworkers work quick to point out the mountain of fat left on my tray.  Bummer.
