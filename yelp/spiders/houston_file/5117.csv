JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tina - Thanks for your review. We appreciate your constructive criticism and will take it under advisement, though it's important to note that we only have 89 seats at JINYA-Midtown, which includes the 9 seats at the liquor bar. And when our wait-list tops out at two hours, like it did last night, we are forced to get somewhat creative to accommodate our guests. Sometimes the seating arrangements are not ideal, but this is the finite space we have to work with. In the coming months, we will be opening two more JINYA locations in Houston, both of which will be significantly larger than our Midtown location. We hope that will alleviate some of the congestion.
