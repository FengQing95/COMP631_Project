Baby Barnaby's////After a very disappointing first visit (didn't even get to eat), both my wife and I tried this place a second time.  This time around the staff was very friendly and the food was fantastic.  A complete 180 from our first visit.  I had the green eggs plate and it was incredible.  I will definitely go back.
