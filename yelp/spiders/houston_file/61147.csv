Baby Barnaby's////I had the Green Eggs which consists of two scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts & jack cheese, chicken apple sausage. potatoes and wheat toast. I really enjoyed my meal. It was filling and delicious. I tried a bite of the French Toast also and that was heaven. We will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu items!
