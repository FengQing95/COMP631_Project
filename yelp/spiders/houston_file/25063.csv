Uchi////I don't know why it's taken us this long to write a review. We have been going to Uchi for years, both for happy hour and dinners. Our first date 4 years ago was here, after which we have come back every 6 months for our anniversaries/half anniversaries and, most recently, for our wedding dinner. Every time, Uchi never ceases to exceed our expectations in food and service. Everyone is fantastic, though we have a soft spot for Anthony, who served us on our first date and every date thereafter for the next 2 years.
