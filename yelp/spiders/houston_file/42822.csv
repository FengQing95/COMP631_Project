Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Usually the Almond croissants are amazing but Today's Almond (10/21/15) croissants were a tad bit over baked but beautiful and tasty I just didn't eat the over baked edges which are usually my favorite part. I tried the CCC with Walnut again because last time it was a disappointment, unfortunately it also was just a bit over cooked as well.  Maybe their recipe is just not for me but I consider my self a CCC  connoisseur. Lunch here is a nice change of pace and done very well.
