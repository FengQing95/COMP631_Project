Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was freaking packed at 10:40AM on a Tuesday! The line was out the door but thankfully we were able to bypass the 15 min wait by opting to sit outside (kinda regretted by the end of the meal, Texas heat is no joke). I had the Benny Goldstein which was AMAZING. Looking at the portion I was worried it wouldn't be enough food. But I was stuffed by the end. I also had the basil mojito and orange snoozious. Mojito was super dressing but the orange snoozious was so-so. Could've done without it. My husband had the Juevos rancheros, huge portion and was amazing. His Bloody Mary was fantastic as was his pomegranate mimosa. The Mimosa tasted so fresh. Like they literally made it from scratch moments prior. If the heat didn't get to us we certainly wouldn't tried more of their amazing beverages! Super surprised how great a brunch places cocktails were and the price for the quality was very impressive. Thankfully they just opened up another location in town and country.
