Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Mind you, the eggplant is $5 while my salad was $11, and you pay at the counter when you order, so it's not like the difference could be knocked off. The sous chef made no mention of the price difference. I figured I would give them a chance to make up the difference somehow; "here, take home this bag of pastries" or something, but no, nothing.
