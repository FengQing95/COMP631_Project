JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Personally I really don't like being seated at a community table when I'm alone but I'm comfortable in my skin. The food is really good and the music is interesting. Â Try the Ramune sodas they are small but really good. The tempura Brussels sprouts will keep u coming back; I never had anything so good. The restaurant is very clean and the waitress is very helpful with food selection especially since in not familiar with the food selection. Can't wait to bring a date here.
