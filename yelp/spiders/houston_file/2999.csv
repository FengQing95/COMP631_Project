JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came here on a Saturday night at around 9:30, the place looked pretty busy but it was only a 30 min wait. The ambiance is pretty modern and inviting, they have 2 big community tables in the middle of the room and smaller tables around the room. The staff is friendly, attentive and fast. We order the Jinya tonkutso and the spicy chicken ramens. They were both very good. The broths were creamy and flavorful. We also tried the salmon sashimi and the tempura shrimp, they were fresh and nicely flavored. Overall, we had a great experience and would be coming back to try other dishes.
