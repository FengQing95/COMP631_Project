Kata Robata////My friends and I were curious about the new incarnation of what used to be Hue: same owners, new chef (a very talented one, at that), different cuisine. Â The Japanese sushi/robata thing works for its sister restaurants Azuma & Soma, so the owners echoed that concept & kept the sleek, modern decor of the former Hue.
