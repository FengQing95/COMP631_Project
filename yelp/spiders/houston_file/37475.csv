Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Been waiting for this place to open up for awhile and it most definitely exceeded my expectations. I could see this place being my go-to spot for southern comfort food and a good whiskey. If I could have my drink of choice, whiskey would be it and this place does it right. 300 whiskeys available to try and their cocktails taste phenomenal. Don't like whiskey? That's okay, they serve beer and other liquor as well.
