Local Foods////This has always been a mainstay in my life ever since I was a freshman in college.  Fresh ingredients, organic quality, and reasonably priced.  I am obsessed with their Smoked Salmon Sandwich; onion jam (heavenly!), in-house smoked salmon, fresh greens and cream cheese.  Talk about YUM!  I have a friend who lives in Boston now, and she cannot stop talking about her love for their Crunchy Chicken sandwich.  For a college student, a trip to Local Foods can be a bit expensive, but I always had leftovers to take with me.  Their side salads are yummy, and very creative.  They are on rotation, yet they always seem to have quinoa and vegan potato salad.  Highly recommend challenging your taste buds, or picking the Chicken Posole soup.
