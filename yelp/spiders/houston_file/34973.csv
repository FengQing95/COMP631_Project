Local Foods////I don't think local foods needs another 5 star review but I absolutely love what they've done due to COVID-19 crisis. The store is turned into a pop up shop. Everyone is wearing masks appropriately. The chicken sandwich was still amazing as always. The sides are pre-packaged. Overall I have high trust in the quality of food and safety.
