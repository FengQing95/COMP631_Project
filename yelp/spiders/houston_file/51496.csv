Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok, if you can make it here when the line isn't 2 hours long, it's actually a pretty good breakfast spot. We had to get up uber early on a Saturday morning and got there by 7:45 am and had about a 15 minute wait. If you come after 8am, then you might as well just not come. There will be zero parking and the wait will be so awful that you will end up hating everyone around you because you will be starving for so long.
