JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Before I go further, please know that the bartender who served you is one of our best. She is swift, professional and polite and has literally served thousands of customers since joining us more than a year ago. My floor managers rarely, if ever, have to deal with complaints on her behalf. So I would like to say upfront that I will weigh her account of events with an equal measure to yours -- it's only fair.
