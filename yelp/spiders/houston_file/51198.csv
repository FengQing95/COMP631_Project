Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Since I'm a rule breaker I got the French toast, peach cobbler pancakes, and the pineapple upside down pancakes. The pineapple upside down pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with caramelized pineapple chunks, housemade vanilla crème anglaise, and cinnamon butter. The pineapple chunks were inside the pancakes rather than on top. The French toast was brioche stuffed with mascarpone then griddled and topped with vanilla crème, salted caramel, fresh strawberries, and toasted coconut. My favorite of the bunch were the peach cobbler pancakes. They also have a pancake of the day so you will have a potentially appetizing surprise on each visit.
