JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. Their soup is downright phenomenal. I've got my favorite (premium tonkotsu white!) but I've tried several other varieties and they were all wonderful too. Their appetizer and side-item menu is pretty tasty as well, and every time I've been there, I've received fast, friendly service. The only drawbacks are the setup of the main dining area and the restrooms. There's extremely limited cell phone reception in much of the main dining area (the bar toward the front is fine though!), and the way the tables are set up, you can end up getting seated at a table with complete strangers if you come during peak hours - which can be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable for a lot of Westerners. The bathrooms are also a bit of an issue, in that there is only one single-stall restroom for each gender, so if you have to go and the place is crowded, it can make for a rather harrowing experience. Those issues can easily be solved by coming during non-peak hours though - plenty of room at the bar, and no restroom lines. In any case, this place is 100% worth visiting, the food is amazing, and I'll keep coming here as long as I live in Houston.
