Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been to Common Bond a few times now, and I enjoy it every single time. That being said, the Chicken Tortas I order today is good, but not exceptional. The Telera Roll is hearty and spongy, doing very well in holding all the guac, salsa roja, crema, cotija, jalape√±os, lettuce. I prefer buns like these that do not disintegrate as you bite through the sandwich or burger, which leaves your hands messy.
