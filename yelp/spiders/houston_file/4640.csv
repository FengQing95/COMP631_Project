JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Noodles. I tried the big noodles but prefer the smaller ones. I have enjoyed the Cha Cha, Tonkotsu white/black, spicy chicken, and can't decide which is better...plus I usually add a couple extras! Also, they have copper mugs for the Moscow mules. Brussels sprouts are the best! I have tried probably 3/4 of the menu and have no complaints.
