Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Delicious pastries and breakfasts.  We frequently have breakfast delivered from here.  Love the chocolate and pistachio croissants.  The one time I went in person to get breakfast to go, it was very crowded and parking was a hassle.  It's hard to hold that against them, however, because the food is so darned good.
