Local Foods////I recently hosted a little lunch here with friends and it was the perfect spot. When you walk in, you will find lots of space and lots of light. I really like the interior of this place, because it doesn't feel crowded. There are plenty of long tables for larger groups and a mix of different types of tables and chairs. The restaurant is counter service, and they have more than one register to keep things moving. Â Their menu isn't huge but it is diverse. When you order, you give them your name. Delivery of food could use some work. Employees wander around looking for someone with that name and it's very inefficient; I hope they change this system (or non-system) soon. I had a benjy's gift card and I was pleased that a manager was able to use it even though it wasn't compatible with their computer system in Local Foods.
