The Pit Room////Best barbecue I've had in Texas. The brisket is hands down juicy and full of flavor. I had that along side with the elot√© (Mexican street corn) and cole slaw. Both great accompaniments. I had to dip into my friends Mac and cheese and charred green beans - both also delicious. My friend and I split the 1lb beef rib because it's so huge; and ofcourse it was great. The food comes with bbq sauce and there's bourbon sauce by the condiment bar. I poured that on everything.
