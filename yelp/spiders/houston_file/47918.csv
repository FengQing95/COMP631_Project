Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been here on multiple occasions but today is the last straw. Zero stars for the inability to run a breakfast eatery on time. Let's start with the basics. Got here at 730 on a Saturday with minimal people here. Tell me why there are visible OPEN tables yet the wait was 20 minutes. Only 1 hostess who was too busy seating people to take our name down. Then when it was our turn they seated someone who came in AFTER us. Clearly their iPad system of guests in line isn't working. And if they pride themselves on their free coffee as you wait... no coffee at all available today. Not that they ran out. No coffee at all. I'm sorry, there are tons of places around town that CAN function on time as a breakfast eatery and they do it well. I suggest snooze get up to par or get out of Houston.
