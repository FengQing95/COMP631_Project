Uchi////I dined at Uchi for my birthday recently, and hands down it was the best dining experience I've had in a Long time! The beautiful hostess, Rachel, made our reservation and sat us promptly with grace and charm. Our waiter, Jose, (request him he's THE best and super hot!) treated us like royalty. We allowed him to make all of the selections for us. Each dish was more unique and delicious than the previous. Every single person working that night that we met had the best energy, and they were all just happy to be there! It wasn't just a dinner, it was an experience. I can't wait to go back. The manager that night, Gio, must be doing something very right to have such an amazing staff coupled with mouth watering food that made every other meal this week feel dismal in comparison.
