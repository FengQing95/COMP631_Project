Local Foods////But all it takes is one bad server (counter person? I don't know what you call him) - think hipster with the "beard" is in look and shaved head. He just did not act at all happy that I came there to get a meal with my family. Probably would have given this place 4 stars since the first server was nice, patient and understanding. But man what a bad taste to your mouth as you're about the leave.
