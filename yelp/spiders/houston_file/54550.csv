Kata Robata////-Kata ramen - this is what I actually ordered. Meh. I was not feeling it. They do their ramen differently from Miyakos and Azuma. So what I got, I was not expecting. Probably wouldn't get it again, but then again my taste buds might not be tuned to what ramen should taste like?? Have I been living a lie all this time?
