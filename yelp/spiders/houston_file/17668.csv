Uchi////UHHHHMAZINGGGG!  I think all the reviews are unanimous in claiming that this is the ultimate restaurant experience so I will make this short and simple.  I was afraid of what to expect because of all the anticipation but Uchi surpassed all!  I've never had a last-meal-on-earth place but now I do!  This place should be a top-notch Houston restaurant staple.  I highly recommend the machi cure which is smoked yellowtail, hamachi nabe which is baby yellowtail and the brie ringo which is tempura fried brie and apple chutney.  Make a reservation ASAP!
