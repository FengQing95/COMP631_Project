Uchi////I have been to all the Uchi locations several times, and will continue doing so! The Austin location serves the dishes consistently well while Uchiko and Uchi Houston are sometimes not as good as they could be. The machi cure is my favorite dish, with the uchiviche, hamachili, dinosaur kale/pear dish as other lovable dishes. The shag and pitchfork are good and help fill my tummy so the bill isn't astronomical. I also love the peanut butter semifreddo, lemon gelato and the awesome creme caramel. I love how Uchi creates dishes that contain amazing ingredients - ones you would't think go together taste like a symphony. The importance of texture is never forgotten either. Crunchy, creamy, soft, firm...everything blends into an orgasmic dance in your mouth. Yes, they serve food porn. The happy hour at Uchi is awesome - I was able to eat there with a friend for $97 (not including tax and tip). We ordered 5 items from the happy hr menu, 4 from the regular menu plus two desserts. I was so stuffed!!! I highly recommend Uchi Houston, even though Austin's will always be my favorite.
