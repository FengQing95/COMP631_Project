Kata Robata////It always great to spend time in Kata Robata!  They serve up super tasty sushi. I recommend it to everyone. You will eat the best sushi not only in Houston but one of the best Sushi restaurants I've come across from all my travels.  We usually visit Houston a couple of times per year and this is a must every time.  Alan from Northbrook, Illinois
