Baby Barnaby's////My favorite dish and usually the thing I come here for is the green eggs. They are so creamy and fluffy and delicious. Their potatoes are well seasoned and the quantity is abundant. And it can be vegetarian friendly with a veggie sausage or you can even get a side of black beans. Their orange juice is always fresh and refreshing in the morning. I've tried their seasonal pancakes before, and they are always fluffy, not super sweet, and huge.
