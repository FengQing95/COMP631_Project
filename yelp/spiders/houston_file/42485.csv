Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The next day, my bf and I were in the area and had the oppotunity to pass by for dessert. The line wasn't too long, but the wait was longer than it really should be. I can clearly see at least five employees behind the bar but yet only one was taking orders and one at the register. The rest were just cleaning up. In my opinion, not an efficient line. But funny enough, I overheard the employees talking amongst themselves and patting themselves on the back about how effiecient they were. People behind me were complaining on how ridiculous the wait time was. But I wasn't about to leave empty handed for the second time, so I sucked it up and waited.
