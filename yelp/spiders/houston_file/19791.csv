Uchi////At the end of the day, the service was incredible, the food was delicious, and we received a free appetizer for a misorder on one piece of sushi. I wouldn't call that a bad experience. The sushi was some of the best I've had in Houston, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the wide array of tastes from the appetizers. When I go back, I'll stick to orders of fish.
