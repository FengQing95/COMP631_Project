Local Foods////Fast, easy to order, and some pretty tasty food. It's kind of like the Urban Plates or Mendocinio Farms of TX. We ordered the veggie sammie and the Asian chicken salad. I appreciated that the could hollow out the bread cor the sammie, which I had no idea was a CA thing till now haha. The salad seemed like it was sitting (premade?) since there was a lot of excess moisture. It was still good but would be better on top of some fresh romaine. Can't wait to come back and try other items on their menu!
