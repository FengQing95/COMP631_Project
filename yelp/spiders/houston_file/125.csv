JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////came here on a saturday night during opening week and the place was jam packed! the wait was an estimated 45min, but i think we ended up waiting an hour and 15min or more. we had a group of 6, so it was understandably a little harder to seat us but it would have been nice to have a better estimate of the wait time. aside from the bar, there's no seating for those who are waiting for a table, so the waiting area got really stuffy and hot from all the people crammed into the small space. we were eventually seated at a long, communal table and were next to some strangers, which was fine. the only thing was that since we were seated next to and not across from each other, it made it difficult to talk to some people in our group. the service here felt rushed and the server seemed annoyed and kinda snobby. however, the food arrived quickly and was surprisingly good for a chain restaurant! the tonkatsu black broth was thick and had a lot of depth, whereas the tonkatsu white was thinner/lighter but without any sacrifice of flavor. the noodles were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients came together well. the broth was a taddd salty for me, but nothing compared to the sodium bomb bowls of ramen that i've had in nyc (e.g. totto ramen and maybe ippudo). everyone was pleased with the ramen and the price was not dirt cheap, but pretty standard for the amount of food. the server came by to ask us what we wanted to order for dessert. when i asked what the options were, he seemed super annoyed again and quietly mumbled something about mochi and almond something. i had to ask him twice to repeat the almond dessert because i couldn't understand anything he was saying. finally, i just asked what was in it and he said it was almond pudding. it sounded good, but ended up being pretty disappointing (had weird-consistency whipped cream on top and overall, didn't taste like much). so just stick with the ramen! i'd come back to jinya after the hype dies down. it's definitely a welcome addition to the previous lack of a ramen scene in h-town!
