Local Foods////I was invited for a lunch meeting here and was not disappointed. I was a little if'y about coming here because I saw that vegan was the main attraction, but the food was delicious. I got the chicken sandwich, fresh chips, and fresh fruit. Everything tasted absolutely amazing. The flavors worked so well together and the fresh fruit was actually fresh. The dining layout is very nice and a great place for a quick bite or a professional meeting. The restaurant is located by Rice Village, so you can get lunch and finish off with a little shopping. I will definitely be inviting some friends here for lunch.
