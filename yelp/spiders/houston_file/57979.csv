Kata Robata////They did not look at the notes on Resy until I arrived. If I had known omakase was not available I would have dined elsewhere. I have dined here multiple times before but wanted omakase to celebrate a birthday. With such a late dinner reservation we were left with little options to go elsewhere. We were given a ton of excuses as to what WE should've done and what WE need to do in the future. It was such a sour taste in my mouth for the whole experience. No issue with our waitress or the food but definitely wouldn't come back. Beyond disappointed with the lack of professionalism. It was hard not to get upset when playing the blame game.
