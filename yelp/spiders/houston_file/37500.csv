Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////LOVE the atmosphere & decor of the place.  Jeremy was an excellent waiter. Gave great recommendations and gave us a tour of the whiskey room.  We loooved the Bosscat fries (SO CRISPY!), and breakfast plate (that whiskey syrup!).  Can't wait to see what they are going to put on the brunch menu!
