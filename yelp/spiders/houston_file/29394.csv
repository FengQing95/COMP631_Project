The Pit Room////This is a cool spot, but there's almost always a long-ish line and it's pricy for the quantity (although not uncommon for BBQ given the laborious, time-intensive smoking process). The venison sausage was excellent with a respectable pop on first bite and a complex flavor. The beef brisket, the true litmus test for the quality of any Texas BBQ joint, was just alright. It had a nice peppery crust, but the mouthfeel was firm and chewy without enough intervening fat content and it was dry enough to mandate sauce. Speaking of sauce, the BBQ sauce I had was by far my favorite part of the whole meal - it was layered with coffee and, I think, bourbon flavors? It was spicy, earthy, tangy, and smooth. Really top-notch. Sides-wise, the okra was pretty good, well-seasoned and minimally slimy. I didn't really enjoy the mac n' cheese, which was watery and lacked salt and sharpness. The inside is a bright, wood-paneled affair with limited seating, but there is outdoor seating available as well. The Pit Room isn't the worst place to get your BBQ fix inside the loop, but not sure I would bring out of town guests here to showcase the finest smoked meats the state has to offer.
