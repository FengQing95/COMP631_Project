Uchi////Menu favorite is the ham and eggs, but really anything on the menu is worth a try- everything I have ever had here has been delicious. Another must try is the fried milk (dessert)- I frequently have random cravings for this. Drinks are good too, but often I don't order one to save room in my appetite for more food :).
