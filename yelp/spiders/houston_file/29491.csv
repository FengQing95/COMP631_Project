The Pit Room////For sides, I tried their mac and cheese (which was super creamy, comfort food at its finest), elote (which had a nice savory kick), coleslaw (if you don't normally like coleslaw, this might be an exception), and charred green beans (which isn't normally offered on their menu, but it's super savory and very good).
