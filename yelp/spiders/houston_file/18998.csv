Uchi////Unfortunately the night started off horribly. I don't care how good the food is, if I make reservations at 8pm, I expect to be seated by 8 (give or take 20 minutes)...not wait Â an hour for a table. I can understand that it's Friday night and it's peak dinner time, but what is the point of making a reservation if there's still an hour wait.
