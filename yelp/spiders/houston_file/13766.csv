JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Decor was dark for lunch but the vibe was young and cool, it's a happening spot for lunch so lots of people walking in an out. Our server was nice and helpful with the menu, I ordered the Cha Cha Cha lover, probably not the best one to order since I'm not a fan of thick noodles.
