Baby Barnaby's////Went to Baby Barnaby's for the first time a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. I love breakfast food and trying new foods... him not so much in trying new anything. I convinced him to go and was a little skeptical when we had to sign in on a notepad and wait outside. We waited about 20 min then got seated. The service was awesome, the food was great, and the serving size was more than enough for us. He got steak and eggs, I got the green eggs, it was all delicious! AND my boyfriend said it's his new favorite spot for breakfast, so you know it's good!
