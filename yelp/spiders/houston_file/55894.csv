Kata Robata////Seventh, more sushi! A5 Wagyu beef, mackeral, anago, tamago, and little rolls (idk what was inside but it had roe on top). The Wagyu beef was delicious, though it was a bit chewy :( Was a bit disappointed in the Wagyu. The mackeral was my favorite out this round. Had many different flavors going around and I think it had seaweed somewhere? something was crunchy but awesome. The anago was probably my least favorite of the whole omakase. It tasted good, but the texture was very mushy... The tamago was yummy! We were told it was prepared differently and not the typical layers.
