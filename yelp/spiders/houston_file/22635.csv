Uchi////Let's start with the drinks. I took a gamble and ordered a sake cocktail, which is something I've never tried before. The drink was called kara kyuri, and it will forever be in my memory as the most delicious cocktail I've ever had. Made with sake, yuzu, cucumber, and thai chili - it offered the most beautiful combination of flavors. Although I love spice, I tend to be a bit sensitive to it, so I expected not to like it much. The flavors were so perfectly balanced, that the chili never gave its full bite. It is complemented perfectly by the yuzu and reigned in by the cucumber. Honestly, it's the entire reason I'm writing this review 3 months later.
