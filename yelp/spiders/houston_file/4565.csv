JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rodney - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. In the past six months, the City of Houston Public Works Department has been tearing up Louisiana and Milam Streets to upgrade the sewage system. As a result, foul-smelling air drifts into our establishment. Until these works are completed, there's little we can do to remedy the situation, regrettably.
