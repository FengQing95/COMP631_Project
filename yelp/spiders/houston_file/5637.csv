JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Ramen would be my favorite Ramen shop in Houston. I always get the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with Pork Gyoza or Salmon Cilantro Sashimi. Great place for a first date. The setting is really intimate. I would recommend coming early because there is always a line. Parking is a little hard to get because it located in midtown. I will be coming back often!
