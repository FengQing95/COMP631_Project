JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Mark - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you think so poorly of our ramen. If there's ever any issue with your ramen (e.g. too salty, undercooked noodles, overcooked noodles, not spicy enough, too spicy), just let your server know and he/she will gladly remake it, or offer something that's more suited to your liking. I understand we're never going to please everyone who walks through our doors, but every employee who draws a paycheck at JINYA-Midtown works their tail off to provide the best service and product we possibly can. As far as adding brussels sprouts to ramen, I might have to agree with you that I'm not Â the biggest fan -- BUT, I would think as a ramen connoisseur, you can agree that there are literally hundreds if not thousands of varieties of ramen, and the term "self-respecting" is subjective at best.
