Uchi////Amazing atmosphere! Amazing food! The French press coffee is great. I sat at the sushi bar and the chiefs are very sociable and funny. I was a party of one and did not feel uncomfortable. The prices are a little bit on the higher side and serving size are smaller. This place is hip and trendy as well as a little fancy with valet parking. There's street parking as well. I parked a few blocks down close to a few bars. I also went during prime dinner time Saturday night and there wasn't a huge line for bigger parties. Definitely a place I will come to again!
