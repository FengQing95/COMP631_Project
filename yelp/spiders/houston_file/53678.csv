Kata Robata////Moving on to the main menu, we got the miso crusted bone marrow, kobe beef skewers, tempura shrimp and the toro sashimi. Despite the disappointing happy hour menu everything off of the main menu was pretty good. However, if I could recommend one thing it would be the kobe beef skewers. The meat literally melted in your mouth and the pesto was a great compliment to the fatty beef. Rawr I'm drooling just thinking about it now. The miso crusted bone marrow was a little overdone and had very little flavor, tempura shrimp was not worth the price and the toro sashimi(fatty tuna) is good like always.
