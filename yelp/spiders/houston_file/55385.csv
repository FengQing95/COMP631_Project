Kata Robata////Also ordered the chirashi and the lobster mac and cheese.  When they dropped off the chirashi at our table, they gave me an extra bowl full of sashimi.  I thought they had accidentally left it there, but it turned out that it was part of the chirashi.  Needless to say, great value.  The lobster mac and cheese was good too, but it really ended up being an afterthought after all the delicious fish we had.
