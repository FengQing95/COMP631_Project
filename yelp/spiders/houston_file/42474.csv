Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have also tried their sweet brioche (I don't see this one anymore, but it reminded me of a giant chouquette - something you only find in France), their Kugelhopf (a unique orange blossom confection that is a treat without being sinful), almond croissant (very rich), chocolate hazelnut brioche (positively sinful), and a few iterations of their fruit croissants. The fruit croissants are my favorite - the lemon/blueberry version was a bit heavy for me, but the strawberry/pistachio version is perfect. Please don't stop making these!
