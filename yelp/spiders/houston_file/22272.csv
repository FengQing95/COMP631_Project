Uchi////Overall the food was excellent, service was some of the best I've ever had, and our evening was perfect. Complimentary valet is a plus since it is really really tough to find parking in this area. I don't normally valet, but I'm so glad it was available this evening. Valet will continue to be available and they are finishing the parking lot and driveway to accommodate everyone more easily.
