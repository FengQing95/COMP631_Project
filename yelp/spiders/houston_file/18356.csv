Uchi////Atmosphere was laid back casual. You can definitely tell because you have waiters running around in a regular button up and jeans. Even one of the workers was just in a plaid button up with nice jeans. I thought he was a customer smiling at me until i realized he was still standing in that one location 20 mins later. lol But i like the atmosphere, laid back, fancy food, but casual. None of that fake-professional-server-talk.
