Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here on Sunday around 2pm, it was a little crowded but hubby and I found a table really quickly. So, we ordered biscuits & gravy and each flavor of macarons. I personally really like the macarons (My favorite is the passion fruit and vanilla). The workers there are nice and friendly. The parking was okay today, i guess we were just lucky. I recommend parking else where and walk here when it's really busy.
