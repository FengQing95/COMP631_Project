The Pit Room////Barbecue is excellent, prices are exorbitant. I got one rib, one sausage and one slice of brisket- $27.00. I'm just old fashioned and grew up eating Hill Country BBQ at a reasonable price.I heard a guy say the other day: It's not easy making craft bar-b-que. I think that says it all.
