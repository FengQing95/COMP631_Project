Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I love this place. It's pretty great. So great in fact that I had some chocolate all over my face when I left and It thought that was pretty amazing. Maggi with an (i) is super friendly and a great server. Pancake flight with Drunk'n monkey is A++ Let's be honest I love breakfast. Generally i'm an impatient person but some how I was able to wait 30 minutes for my meal. Was it worth it? Some would say No. However I totally say YES. The bacon was so crisp and just the right shade of golden toasty goodness. So I guess this place is pretty ok.
