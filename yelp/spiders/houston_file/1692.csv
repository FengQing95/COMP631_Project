JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I just noticed I haven't reviewed this place, and I can't believe it!!!! Ever since my first time here, I absolutely loved it. Anytime I've been, it's been relatively busy, which isn't surprising to me because of how much I like it. You walk in, they have a small bar with sports on TV and a pretty decent selection of beer, which of course is always good. The interior has a nice casual feel to it, and everything was very clean. I ordered the #2, which if I remember correctly, was the spicy chicken ramen. I love spicy, so I got the hottest level and of course added all the special sauces including sriracha. As a spicy lover, the combo of the spicyness of the ramen itself and all the sauces was perfect for me. Gets me sniffling just how I like! Perfect to be washed down with an IPA! I've only tried a few other ramen places, but this one instantly became my favorite. Oh yeah, add extra egg to the ramen, you won't regret it!
