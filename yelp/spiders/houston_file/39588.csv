Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They have a good selection of craft cocktails with their signature cocktails going at $14 a pop. A little pricey for Houston but I guess we are in the Galleria district. I had their take on the gin & tonic and a Moscow mule which were both solid. They also have a small patio area. I definitely like to come back to try the food and I got a peek at the menu. It mostly consists of Southern cooking. The pulled pork hushpuppies stood out, I'll have to try those next time! Bosscat recently opened and they make a nice addition to the Galleria bar scene which is pretty lacking for a younger crowd.
