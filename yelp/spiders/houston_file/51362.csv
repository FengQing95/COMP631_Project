Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2. Benny Duo- I've had the Chile Verde Benny and Smashed Avocado Benny. I really loved the Chile Verde one. The barbacoa was so tender and all of the toppings complemented each other very well. The Smashed Avocado Benny was good and light, but I regretted getting it because I feel like I would have liked something with more protein on it. Next time, Ill try Ham Benedict or Steak + Eggs Benny.
