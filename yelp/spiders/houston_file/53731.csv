Kata Robata////What spoiled our mood was the service there. We went there a little after noon. The service was.really slow. After the main courses, we waited half a hour for the dessert. It was kinda peak hour which I understand but they were either severly understaffed or the waitress was just not trained well. She was serving 4-5 tables around our sitting area. She was barely around and we waited 15 minutes for order. Then when we asked for the check, she did not ask how we would like to split it and expected us to calculated how much each of us need to pay. "You can use your phone to calculate and just let me know." she said. I really did not anticipate this when I was paying 40 some dollars for a lunch.
