Local Foods////Restaurant is always busy indicating they are doing something right.   Asian salad was delicious.  Truffle egg salad sandwich comes with 2 sides;  chose sopa noodles and kale salad.  Terrific.  Banh mi also comes with 2 sides:  sopa noodles and tabouli.  Delicious but hard to spend $11 for a sandwich when I can go to Les Givrales and get one as good for one-third the cost.
