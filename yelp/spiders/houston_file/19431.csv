Uchi////Got here at 7:30.  It is now 9:17.  We left. Never got to try anything but drinks and edemame.  We were told the kitchen was backed up with their desserts but just 1/2 hr before we were told by the hostess that the table that was going to be for us was finishing dessert (confused).  When we first got there we were told 1 hr wait max, we were there two hours :-(.  We asked for our check and then We got double charged . Just wasn't the best experience.  Going to The Bluefish for dinner ... Peace!
