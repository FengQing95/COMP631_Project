Kata Robata////most of my friends and i got specialty rolls and loved them!! only one of my friends didnt really like her roll she got which was the kobe beef roll. personally i steer clear from non seafood sushi rolls. one of our friends got 2 regular rolls and seemed to like it. 2 regular rolls are basically the price of one specialty roll but the regular rolls are just the same basic rolls you see everywhere else but probably made with better quality stuff. personally i say if youre going to come here just shell out the extra cash. it wont be disappointing!
