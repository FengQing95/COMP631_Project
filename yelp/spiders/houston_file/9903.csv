JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////YES.  PLEASE.  Any day of the week... any time of day... I'll take it.  The food is DELICIOUS, comes out fast, is consistently prepared so you never have surprises from one day to the next and the prices are very reasonable considering it's location.  If you're a fan of Asian noodle dishes this is very authentic and the flavors are amazing.  In addition...their Brussel sprouts (ewwwwwwww I know) are amazing and are now the only way I will ever eat Brussel sprouts.
