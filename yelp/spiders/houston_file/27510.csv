The Pit Room////Everyone was raving about the brisket but I have to say it was way toooo peppery,huge chunks and you had to pull on it when it should fall apart. The potato salad had way too much celery and it was dry. The bbq sauce tasted exactly from Bill Miller BBQ. And the only pickles they had were habanero infused pickles . No thank you. I will not returning to this pit place ! The employees there were very nice tho.
