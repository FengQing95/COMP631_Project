Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Warning: Yah, parking does suck but what do u expect being at the corner of Westimhemer and Dunlavy. Small parking lot with very limited street parking so Get there early or come late. I lady at the counter did suggest they post their weekly menu online so I most def be checking it often for when they decide to bring back the soft shell Crab sandwich....hint hint ;)
