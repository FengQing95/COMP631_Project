Uchi////We decided to give it a try last Friday 3/11. We got there at 7 and since we didn't had reservations the wait was about 1.45h. We decided to stay anyway, as we were craving some good sushi. We waited in the patio, which had music and drink service. From time to time servers would even bring out some samples of sushi.
