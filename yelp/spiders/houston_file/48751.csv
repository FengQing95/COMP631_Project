Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had breakfast hear this morning with a friend and we loved it. We started by splitting a pineapple upside down pancake, then he had the egg white frittatas and I had the quinoa porridge. The pancake was superb, but could have passed for a dessert and it comes with cinnamon butter made in house. The frittata was a little under-cooked, but still delicious and the hashbrowns that came with it were cooked to perfection (crisp on the outside and soft on the inside) and they came with melted cheddar and green onions on top. My porridge was a combination of quinoa and oats and it was decadent, served with fresh cut peaches, maple syrup, and a dollop of whipped cream.
