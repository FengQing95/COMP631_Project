Baby Barnaby's////There's nowhere to park so the only option is street parking so if you're unfamiliar with the area it may be a bit hard to know where you can/cannot park. There's no hostess outside so as you walk up you have to just write your name on a clipboard with a sheet of paper and they just go off that list. The place is much smaller on the inside than I imagined..not much seating at all. The maximum inside is 35. But there is a few tables outside as well but not many.
