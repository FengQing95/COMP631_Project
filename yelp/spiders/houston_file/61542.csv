Baby Barnaby's////We waited over an hour outside in the hot sun for a table and never got sat. Â There were two tables completely done with their meals chatting while a lot of people were waiting in the hot sun to be sat outside. With COVID many restaurants are putting time limits on how long a table because there is limited real estate outside. This restaurant chooses not to do that...so disappointing. We weren't the only table to decide to leave. Again very disappointing.
