Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If Snooze wasn't always so damn crowded every weekend, I would be coming here every Saturday! Not only is the food great, it's affordable too! I had the OMG French toast, and it definitely lived to its name! I definitely felt like I inhaled my meal (because it was that good!), compared to my partner, where it looks like he barely made a dent.
