JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Mike - Thanks for your review. I have been in the restaurant industry for more than 25 years, and I can honestly say there is absolutely no perfect method for seating guests, regardless of party size. While every scenario is handled on a case-by-case basis, we have instructed our hosts to adhere to a very firm policy on not seating incomplete parties.
