Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Crowded, but good. I thought the food was pretty good, but the service was ridiculously good. The people serving the food and coffee during brunch were so friendly and on the spot. I think this place needs to get a bigger location! They were slammed and it made it to where it displayed lack of control within the restaurant. I was a fan though. Good pastries, good coffee, and good brunch.
