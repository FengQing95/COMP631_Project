JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place serves really good ramen in the Houston area. I also tried their tacos and they were good but a little overpriced. Came with a group of 4 on a Friday night and the wait wasn't too bad. I think this place is best for like small parties or like a date night based on the way seating and the ambiance.
