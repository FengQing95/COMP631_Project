The Pit Room////Sides made it that much better.  First the wait is not as insane.  Even though you can reserve and order online now at Franklin's.  Both has meat that falls off the bone.  Brisket was dynamite it was so tender.  How tender? I brought some home for people and after reheating they said it was bomb.  This is after a 3 hr flight.  Turkey was juicy and moist.  Only thing I thought was average was the sausage and chicken.
