Uchi////I have never been more satisfied with a restaurant than I have with Uchi. The food, the service, and the ambiance are equally impressive. I have eaten here 5 times and I have never had a single dish that wasn't fantastic. I worked in the food industry for many years and so I appreciate the small things. Uchi's attention to detail is a breath of fresh air and will always leave you wanting more. Lastly I will say that if you are on a tight budget you can still enjoy Uchi! Their happy hour menu is the best in the country!
