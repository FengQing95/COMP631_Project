Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Every time I visit, there is a wait... Thats because the food is very good! This is the place to go if you are entertaining someone/people for breakfast. The plating is homey, yet beautiful. There are a plethora of pancake selections, oh and did someone say Benedict? I have had every twist on their eggs and pancakes and all I say is wow! No waffles here though guys! Btw these guys try to stay green and protect the environment so you may hear a story of how they source their food.
