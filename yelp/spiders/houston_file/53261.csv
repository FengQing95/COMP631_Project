Kata Robata////These all led me through a fantasyland of flavors. I loved elements of all dishes.  The rents LOVED the short rib course.  I liked a lot, but the bone marrow powder would make Anthony Bourdain jealous.  Chef Hori is so talented and patient and I enjoyed watching his craft.  Incredible experience!!!
