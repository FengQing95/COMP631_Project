Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Tomato bisque (4/5): Probably one of the best tomato bisques I've had! My partner didn't like it as much though, because he thought it was too sweet. I on the other hand, like the sweetness of the soup. It also wasn't heavy on cream which I like! There's also a side of grilled cheese that comes with the dish, nice touch.
