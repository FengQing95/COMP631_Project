JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my time at a ramen restaurant. Loved the Jinya Bun; the pork belly was so flavorful and tender.  The brussel sprouts tempura needs a dash of seasoning immediately after frying, but it was better once we got some spicy mayo for dipping.  The caramilzed cauliflower was just okay.  Loved the spicey creamy shrimp tempura.  We ended up splitting the tonkotsu black, and it was absolutely yummy.
