Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here with industry colleagues. Had a 38 special and their Manhattan, both good but liked the 38 better. We had the parmesan crusted meatloaf, the avocado toast with shrimp, and the pig candy, which was my favorite. Snapper in the Rye was kind of bland. The day we went it was not too super busy which was great for me.
