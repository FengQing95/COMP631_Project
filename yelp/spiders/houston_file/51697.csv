Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So Peter checks in on us I remind him of the OJ he goes back to get it, my mimosa comes out... at this point it is 10:15 AM Â we have been waiting since 9:20 to sit and eat. 10:45 AM is upon my party and I, so I stop a worker walking past and inform her they could cancel the order because it doesn't seem like it was put in, Peter brings us the bill and the mimosa and orange juice is on there....
