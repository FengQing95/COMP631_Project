Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's probably easier to park on the street than to attempt to park in the tiny parking lot in front of Snooze. This place is popular, so don't be surprised if there's a wait. They'll text you when a table is available or you can sit at the bar if a seat opens up. While you're waiting there are games to play out front. The staff is super friendly here.  I liked the decor, it's bright and colorful. Mae was a great server, she had good recommendations and was very attentive. The house coffee is a Guatemalan blend, but I went with the Boomtown coffee, a darker Houston roast. I decided on the Benny Duo, which lets you try two of the hollandaise dishes and is served with the house hash browns. I chose the Ham Benedict III (English muffin topped with shaved Tender belly ham, a perfectly poached cage free egg, covered in smoked cheddar hollandaise) and the Benny Goodman (Lox style salmon and cream cheese served over toasted rye topped with a poached cage free egg, cream cheese hollandaise and a sun dried tomato and caper relish).  They're happy to customize dishes however you like, for instance, Mae asked if I wanted to add avocado or something else. I'd definitely order the hollandaise dishes again they were delicious.  The house hash browns have a nice presentation, but next time I'll get the hash browns crispy and flat.  The Yellowbird sauce, made in Austin from Serrano peppers, was amazing with the hash browns and eggs. The OMG! French toast was good and will satisfy your sweet tooth; it's fresh brioche stuffed with mascarpone and topped with vanilla crème, salted caramel, fresh strawberries, and toasted coconut. I'll be back soon!
