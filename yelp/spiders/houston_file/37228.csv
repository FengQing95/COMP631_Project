Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I did not know what to do for a casual night out, and so I pull out my list of Bookmarked places on Yelp. We decided on Bosscat and it turned out to be an awesome choice and we definitely have plans on coming back, though next time we are probably going to plan on coming a little earlier since we got there around... Probably somewhere between 10pm and midnight (?) I honestly can't remember, but the time that we showed up did have an effect on our experience.
