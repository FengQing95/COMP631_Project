The Pit Room////I've been to Killen's and Roegel's and Gatlin's and many others, and I think this is the best bbq joint in Houston.  What sets them apart is that every single thing you eat will be fantastic.   Many bbq restaurants (like Roegel's) have good meat but lame sides. This place pleases on all fronts.  And I love their buns.  I'm also really glad it's not way out in BFE.
