JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Catherine - Thank you for your review and feedback. We have not changed our noodles or our broth recipes at any of our locations whatsoever. In fact, we purchase our noodles and ship them 3x per week from our corporate headquarters to ensure consistent quality. And we have specific chefs who spend 10-12 hours per day creating our signature broths from scratch.
