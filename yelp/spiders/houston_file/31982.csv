Local Foods////Perfect for a quick lunch but youn still want something kind of fancy. I love that the menu is not that big, still there are diferent options for every taste. The sides are as worthy as the main entre√©. Quinoa and Tuscan Kale are my favorites. Local Food has got a nice selection oflical offerins as beers an wines.
