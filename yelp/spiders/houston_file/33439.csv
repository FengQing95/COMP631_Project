Local Foods////I will say I didn't really enjoy their other side items. The chip seasoning is gross, the cabbage slaw was bad, and the local fruit was an underwhelming two skinny slices of watermelon. However, the soups are very tasty, so I recommend getting soup instead. The cookies are very decadent and delicious.
