Uchi////I went here with my boyfriend on Valentines day as our first time here since I've been wanting to try this place out. It was a walkin and we waited 1 hour out on the patio area which was nice since we could order tea and edamame to enjoy while waiting. Hostess and waitress on the patio was very hospitable and attentive. After we got seated we were introduced to the chef since we were seated at the sushi bar. We then went ahead and ordered the Omakase with the chef and I think either he forgot to put the order in for he forgot to tell the waitress to put the order in. It took a very long time for us to receive our courses and in between courses there were long waits. Total meal time took 3 hours.
