Baby Barnaby's////The food and atmosphere were phenomenal and all I could think about was how this would become our new breakfast spot. Then we paid and as I was finishing up my coffee, the waitress rudely said "there are a lot of people waiting". I totally get that there was a line but I had just as much right to sit and enjoy something I paid for rather than being rushed out. Had we been there more than an hour, I would have completely understood but we had only been there about 35 minutes. Unfortunately, no matter how wonderful the food and atmosphere is, I don't want to fear feeling rushed through my Sunday morning breakfast. Really bummed we were not treated better.
