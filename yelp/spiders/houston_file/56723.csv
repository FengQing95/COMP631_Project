Kata Robata////We just left the parking lot ...... place was about 50-60% full. We were seated right away when we walked in, as they weren't that busy. After being seated we sat for 15-20 minutes without even being acknowledged. No servers came over. No one checked on us. No one brought us drinks. Nothing. Again, they weren't that busy. So while my review isn't actually on the food, it's on the place and service over all. I didn't come just for the food but for good customer service and a good restaurant staff. We heard they were rated well and top list in Houston ........ but we weren't impressed by being ignored.
