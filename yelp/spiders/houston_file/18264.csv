Uchi////All in all, this place is definitely an experience that I would recommend to everyone and anyone. My gf hates raw fish and said she would never eat it.. when I took her here we were battling it out for the last piece. They have an AWESOME HH which I encourage for all the foodies who cannot afford their normal prices or just do not want to spend close to 80+ a person.
