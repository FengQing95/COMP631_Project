Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You guys though...the eggs benny come in so many styles! I had the chilaquiles, which by definition should be spicy but were not, but they were so good it didn't matter! The Pico de Gallo was so fresh & had amazing flavor. I've never had a more perfectly poached egg...it was sorcery.
