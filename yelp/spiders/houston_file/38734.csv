Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had a sangria which was pretty good. If I could tolerate more than one glass, the bottomless option would be a much better deal. We had a side of fries to start off which were the big cut fries. Not too much there but if you're starving, it can alleviate some hunger pain. I had the meat loaf and hash which was somewhat underwhelming. We also had the french toast fruitty pebbles one which I like more.
