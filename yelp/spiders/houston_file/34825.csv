Local Foods////Love Local Foods for lots of reasons!  They have really great, farm fresh, organic, locally sourced food first of all.  The menu is creative and tasty.  They have fabulous baked goods too which I try to avoid because they are that good.  Aside from their great food, they have had this fantastic, convenient gourmet pop up market during Covid which I have loved so much.  Lastly, This place is so good to our community.  It's a win-win dining here.
