Kata Robata////Shishito($5):  We love shishito peppers.  My dad used to grow them in the backyard growing up in Japan.  Shishito is mild, but once in a while there are "OMG this is HOT!" kind of peppers.  My dad used to say "don't pick shishito when you are mad.  Peppers get hot."  Seriously?  But some are spicy hot, so be careful.
