Uchi////Some of the stand out happy hour dishes included the 72 hour short rib, the walu walu, and the sake kiwi. The 72 hour short rib (social short rib on Sake Social menu), though a small portion, is very well executed dish, composed of a delicious, slightly spicy sauce, with lotus root and a peanut garnish adorning some very tender cubes of short rib. Together, it makes for a great textural and flavorful experience. The sake kiwi could have used a touch of salt, but it was a great deal at only $6 for a solid portion of salmon, and definitely made for a tasty few bites. The walu walu, a oak grilled piece of escolar in a flavorful sauce, was a unique dish that changed my previously negative perception of escolar. I would highly reccomend trying almost everything from the Sake Social menu that sounds or looks good to you.
