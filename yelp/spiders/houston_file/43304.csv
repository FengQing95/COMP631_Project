Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was super excited when they first opened and I was the girl in line taking instagram pictures and ordering one of everything...I think I spent $66 on bread that day. Yep.  but, Let's be realistic people.  Waiting in line for a 6 dollar croissant is not really all that worth it again for me.  If you've ever been to 99 Ranch Market Bakery, you find similar pastries for half the price.  I tried the Monte Cristo at Common Bond and it wasn't really like a Monte Cristo.  Also, note,  that they don't warm your pastries if you don't ask for it, nor did anyone that helped us offer heated pastry option.  So once they put it on your plate and you have the plate in your hands, they're "not supposed to take them back to heat them" as I was told after realizing my pastry was cold.  I did try to come again to impress a friend and see if ti would be any different but they don't make food after a certain time so we had to leave and go some place else.
