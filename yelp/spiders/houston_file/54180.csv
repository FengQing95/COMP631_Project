Kata Robata////The kitchen - 5 stars. Truly phenomenal with tough to find traditional Japanese menu items.  The hamachi kama is heavenly -- grilled to a crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Everyone who is reading this review and have never had hamachi kama before need to head over there right now and try it.  The oxtail ramen is also one of our favorites.  Everything we've tried off the menu is delicious.
