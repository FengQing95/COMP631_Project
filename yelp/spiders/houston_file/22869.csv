Uchi////My husband and I have been going here for years.  It used to be our go to place for good food and service. Last night we came back and service has been going down-hill. It wasn't bad, but definitely nowhere near where they used to be and definitely not what you expect for a restaurant that caliber. When we first went, we had Dale as our server a few times. He was FANTASTIC. Actually, everyone used to be. They used to take pride in bringing out the dishes, telling us what it was and how to eat it.  Last night, the two girls that brought out the dishes just said the name of the dish and dropped it off and walked off. It's the kind of thing that you would expect at a Chili's. There was one guy that brought out a couple of the dishes and he did a good job with the presentation.
