JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here for dinner with my friends the other night and was pretty impressed. Definitely better than other places I've been to for ramen. We had the brussel sprouts tempura, takoyaki (octopus balls), and pork bun. I wasn't a big fan of the brussel sprouts but probably because I prefer them not fried and with more flavor. The takoyaki and pork bun I do recommend.
