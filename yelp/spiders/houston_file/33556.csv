Local Foods////Those are the words I keep reading every time I'm on Yelp Houston and I scroll down to the Restaurants section. When you're the top rated place in the 4th largest city in America, you're kind of the shit. Like people will go out of their way to drive miles and miles to try you. I didn't though, because I live 3 minutes away, but still. It's the thought that counts.
