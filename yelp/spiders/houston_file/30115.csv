The Pit Room////SOLID barbecue!! Was staying near by, and I could not stop smelling the delicious BBQ in the air! The line was a bit intimidating when we first arrived as it was extending around the building. However, it moved at a good pace and we were up at the serving line within 20 minutes. I had the brisket tacos which I would highly recommend
