Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One of the best burgers in Houston. The bun: AMAZING. The quality of the beef: AMAZING. But those fries?: TO DIE FOR. They are enormous wedges--nearly 1/4 of a potato with an amazing crispy crunch on the outside. I can never finish the whole thing, but they are just as good when reheated in the oven.
