Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is 5 Stars! I walked in late night without a reservation and still got seated!!! I had a Mai Tai and a Long Island (I'd say get the LIIT) and the drinks were stiff! Had the Catfish, Dr Pepper Wings, and the Blueberry Pie!!! Catfish was some mid. Wings was hitting. Blueberry buttermilk pie was top tier! Ima be back w a reservation next time.
