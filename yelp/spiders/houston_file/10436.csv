JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the tonkatsu black, (a super loaded bowl of yums) and the takoyaki. The food is full of flavor and the service is excellent. The ambiance is spot on and the decor is perfect. The rock garden on the middle tables are so pretty. Next time, I'm going to dinner so I can taste the cocktails.
