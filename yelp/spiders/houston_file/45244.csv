Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I also ordered the breakfast burger and biscuit and gravy. I must say the it was a pretty darn good burger though the sausage was a bit salty. The biscuit on the other hand was ok. The biscuit was a bit dry for my taste and the sauce was more salty that I would have liked. The fruit tart was great and had a crispy shell which paired quite nicely with the custard filling and juicy fruit!
