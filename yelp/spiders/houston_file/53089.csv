Kata Robata////We started off with a bottle of the featured wine, bone marrow, and agadashi tofu. The bone marrow came with 2 dipping sauce, some pickled radish, and toast. It was a burst of flavor and textures - fatty, crunchy, sweet. The agadashi tofu was perfection. The batter was so light it didn't even taste fry and it was served more to look like a soup. I could eat this stuff every day. We shared the omakase. The two of us could not finish it, but every piece was so fresh and unique.
