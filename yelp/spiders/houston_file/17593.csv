Uchi////This has got to be one of my all time fave restaurant. They seem to have everything down to the T... from the quality of food in every dish to the little details that add the WOW factor. As I have said it before, party in your mouth! Â Fried milk dessert is a must! And yes, there is a right and wrong way to eat something and you can't appreciate the full workings of all the flavors of the dish if you don't eat it the right way! :)
