Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Would recommend getting one of their fancier desserts-everything that I've ever gotten is delicious and beautiful. Love the pumpkin one that they have-that one is probably my all time favorite. Although if you're going to do a to-go order, look at the pastry/dessert that they give you before you leave because sometimes they make mistakes.
