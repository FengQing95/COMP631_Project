Uchi////All in all I should caution future patrons that the servings are small.  I was very full after our 10 courses but then I have what I'd call a medium-sized appetite.  Someone with a larger appetite would definitely need to order more.  But heck, it's UCHI!!!  One of the best restaurants in the Southwest. Live it up!
