Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////-Another standout on their pastry display: the KOUIGN AMANN. To be honest, I find myself ordering this on my trips to Common Bond more often lately. If you don't know what a kouign amann is (I didn't), it's like a crustier, more densely-packed croissant. Because the layers are less fluffy, you really get a mouthful of all that delicious butter. It also has a glaze of caramelized sugar on the bottom that adds a beautiful crunch. To save you the embarrassment of not knowing how to say the name, it's pronounced kind of like "queen uh-mawn."
