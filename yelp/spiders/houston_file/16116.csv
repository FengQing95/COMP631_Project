JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////DELICIOUS. My husband and I are from out of town and picked here because we love ramen and JINYA was most reviewed. We loved it so much we brought my brother when he got in town. I tried both Vegan ramens and they were both amazing. I think I would choose the miso broth personally over the creamy one but both are so good! I wish we had a place like this where were from. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
