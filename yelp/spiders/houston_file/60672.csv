Baby Barnaby's////I've been to Baby Barnaby's a couple of times and there's a lot of things they're doing right. First of all, they have a dog-friendly patio. Major kudos for that. The restaurant's a little cramped and dingy, but the ambiance is like a rainbow slapped you in the face - which at least helps with the morning grogginess. Most importantly, the food's solid. From their Green Eggs w/ apple-wood sausage (I absolutely adore those creamy, cheesy artichoke-spinach-truffled eggs!) to their variety of HUGE fruit-filled pancakes (do share!) to their *fresh* squeezed OJ (ask for ice; they serve it at room temp) -- Baby Barnaby's breakfast is definitely one worth waking up for.
