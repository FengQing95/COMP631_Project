Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait can be very long (I've waited over an hour for a table, but I was in no rush with my friends), but they do provide complementary coffee for your wait and activities for kids, or adults ;), to do while you wait. There is a bar where you can order specialty drinks such as mochas or breakfast cocktails, while you wait. Be warned though, that if you have to wait around an hour during the summer, there is no room to wait inside, and outside can get very hot very quick with that morning sun, so make sure to wear a hat.
