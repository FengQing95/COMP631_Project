Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My meal consisted of smoked salmon on toast and it was what I expected--delicious. I had some orange juice on the side and I ended up sitting at one of the bar like areas with my friend. It was a little cramped as Common Bond is always filled with customers, but I did happen to enjoy the nice upbeat atmosphere. Would recommend this place to anybody!
