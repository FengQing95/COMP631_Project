Kata Robata////The quality of food and service is so consistent here. The items on the menus do change occasionally aside from the main menu they provide that is bigger. My top items would have to be their lobster mac and cheese, salmon carpaccio, brussel sprouts, pork & shrimp shu mai, 72 hour cooked 'kobe beef' skewers, and their green tea souffle cheesecake.
