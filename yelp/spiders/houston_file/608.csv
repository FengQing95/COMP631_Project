JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Katherine - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you were not happy with your takeout order. I must be honest, serving (or eating) our ramen from a container is definitely not the optimal method. True ramen, as you know, is best served from the broth pot as soon as possible. But, our customers have demonstrated demand for takeout ramen so we must comply. Ironically, I'd guess many of our customers were first introduced to ramen from the styrofoam cup o' Noodles.
