Kata Robata////I have been here several times, both lunch and dinner. I still have mixed feelings about this place. The food is no doubt one of the best in Houston. I am a traditional sushi-eater and Kata Robata always caters my appetite. The nigiri and sashimi come out fresh and neatly sliced every time; they have many exotic choices, such as Aji and Mirugai. However their chef's daily creations are occasionally "blah" which make Â you wonder whether they just want to get rid of the fish before it goes bad. I am neither a big fan of their rolls. I tried almost every signature rolls they have on the menu and none of them were memorable or to die for (and kinda overpriced). I rather go for a simple spicy yellowtail roll. And yes, the portion is tiny, but that's the way Japanese cuisine should be. If I want to stuff myself, I will go to a Chinese buffet.
