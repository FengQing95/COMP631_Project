JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////By far, my favorite already of the latest ramen joints to invade Houston. Flavorful broth with a variety of dishes to choose from; I'll be coming back again and again. I went for the Jinya Black Ramen. It's what made the chain famous, and I can see why. The pork belly melted as soon as it my mouth! A good started for someone new to ramen. Â Five minute egg was exactly as it should be with a perfect yoke to add to my plate. Also ordered apps beforehand. Perfectly crisp and tasty pork Gyoza that tasted freshly made as well as the truffle park fries. Hip decor and upscale atmosphere with prices that don't break the bank. Perfect date night option or pre-bargame dinner!
