The Pit Room////You know it's good when you have to drive around the block to find parking & the line is out the door to order your tray. Brisket, sausage & pork ribs were all top notch. Just plain & simple BBQ. The meat speaks for itself w/out sauce, but the sauce was good by itself. This place is a must for anyone coming thru the Houston area. Patio seating has TV's to enjoy whatever game is on.
