JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Me and a group of my 10 friends decided to go to JINYA around 7pm. Because there was such a large group of us, we had a wait around 45 minutes which ended up turning into an hour wait. The waiting area is very small, but there is a bar which makes the wait more enjoyable. We ended up getting seated 8 together and 2 separately. They sat us around the center of the main round table in the middle. We kindly asked the two strangers separating our group to switch spots with us which they willingly did.
