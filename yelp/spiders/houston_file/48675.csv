Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Well.. you definitely can't SNOOZE if you want to get a table at SNOOZE. I arrived at about 10am on a Saturday and I waited an hour and a half for my table for two. This place is beyond popular. But definitely worth the wait if you have good company. They will take your name and phone number at the front to give you a text when the table is ready that way you can do some walking or venture some where near by while you wait. Or, Enjoy some good ol' corn hole outside! (We ended up waiting in the car)
