JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kennie - Thank you very much for the stars. We greatly appreciate it, and we are especially happy to know we rank high in your estimation as a ramen connoisseur. We've only been open for just under two years, but we hope we have been able to put Houston on the Ramen Map of the United States. Thanks again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
