Uchi////Our favorite fancy restaurant in Houston!  Every time we go, there's consistency in the service, quality of food, cleanliness of the restaurant, and well-trained staff.  Complimentary valet and Happy Hour from 5-6:30pm.  You'll have to start lining up around 4:45 for HH if you don't have reservations though.  The chefs are creative, talented artists, because they mix these ingredients that you would never believe would go together.  Must try: hama chili, machi cure, madai, sake, sake toro (more fatty than the sake), foie gras nigiri (sounds weird, but the taste is amazing!), hotate (scallop), brussel sprouts, walu walu, hot rock with beef, fried milk.  My personal favorite is that they have seasonal menus that encompass new dishes, cocktails, and desserts.  You need to try the Uchi experience at least once!  See my pictures for the seasonal items!
