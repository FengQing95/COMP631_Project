Kata Robata////Octopus crudo was nicely balanced , nice thinly sliced sweet octopus with I think is a Meyer lemon with some tiny mushrooms... the mushrooms might have been a little strong in contrast to the octopus so it's a bit overpowering but I wish that had more flowers to go with the octopus.. the floral taste went well with the citrus and octopus :) I'm very satisfied minus the mushroom.
