JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hubby and I first came around 5pm on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. The layout comprises a row on the left of 2-person booths, two large tables in the middle, and some 4-6 seater tables along the wall on the right. There's also a bar up in front for drinks (and maybe food?) as well as a bar in the back where you can watch them make the food! There's a happy hour menu during the early dinner hours, and we ended up getting the JINYA Bun (pretty tasty, although tbh I probably wouldn't pay full price for it). We also opted for the takoyaki, which I would highly recommend. Most places end up dousing the balls in WAY TOO MUCH sauce, but JINYA decorates the sauce at the bottom of the plate and puts the takoyaki balls on top so that you can decide how much sauce you really want to use.
