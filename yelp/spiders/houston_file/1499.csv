JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Onto the ramen (we didn't order appetizers for lunch service).  I had the tonkotsu assari, the bf had the spicy chicken ramen.  The ramen came out in about 10 minutes or so, and both soups were perfection.  The tonkotsu assari had chewy, tasty thick ramen noodles, tender kikurage, rich salty tonkotsu broth, a perfectly cooked/seasoned soft boiled egg, and delicious pork chashu that fell apart with the touch of a chopstick.
