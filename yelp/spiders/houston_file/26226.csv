The Pit Room////The recognition TPR is receiving is well deserved. IMO, this is the best BBQ in Houston proper right now. From its traditional fare (brisket, ribs, sausage, chicken) to the creative and delectable tacos, this little smokehouse is a well-oiled machine hitting on all cylinders. Great sides & friendly staff to boot. It's my current go-to resto and the first place I recommend to locals and visitors wanting a solid + authentic Texas BBQ experience. Congrats on the Top 50 Texas Monthly ranking and looking forward to all your future success.
