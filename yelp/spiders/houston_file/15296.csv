JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The server her name is Erin. She was attentive and gave us a great service. I never ate Japanese food before and she gave me the best options to get, and yes it was worth the price I paid. Now it wasn't the best but good enough. She recommended a lot of good stuff on the menu.
