JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was good. The atmosphere was busy at lunch time. I sat at the bar and the waitstaff do some yelling thing. I could have done without that. But I enjoyed dining there. Service was super friendly and attentive. A little on the pricey side for ramen. Everything tasted fresh and super flavorful.
