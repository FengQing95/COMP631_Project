Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We ordered the chocolate croissant and the black forrest cheesecake. They were both delicious. The flat whites we ordered were okay. I would definitely just come here for pastries. We looked out their menu and the prices for the entrees were on the higher side. However, we'll definitely go back to try their entrees.
