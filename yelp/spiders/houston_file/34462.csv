Local Foods////Although they serve beer and wine at Local Foods, I'm not really sure I would want to drink here. When I have a sandwich, I usually don't want to drink as well. From what I've had so far, I see so much potential that they could have that they just aren't doing right now. If they served a charcuterie plate or something else, it would be a great place to have a drink. The other thing is kind of the elephant in the room and that is prices. I've been to numerous places around the US that rely on being local. However, they are either overpriced or are the food just isn't up to par. If Local Foods could have their prices be competitive to the chains that are around the area, they would be my go to place for a nice, pleasant lunch.
