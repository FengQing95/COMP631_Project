Kata Robata////Between the two of us, we tried a bunch of different dishes that ranged from just okay to heavenly.  We started with lamb lollipops which were a bit too lamb-y for my taste.  I didn't taste much seasoning on it, but it was cooked to perfection.  My hubby loves lamb, so he was quite content to finish up my half and declared it perfect.
