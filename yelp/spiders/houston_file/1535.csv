JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I feel like this place is overhyped. Ramen is not bad, but not the best I've had. I've been here 2x and I can't remember what I ordered, but I ordered different dishes...both tasted alright to me. I still prefer ramen in Vancouver. I don't mind going back, but it's not a place I will be craving.
