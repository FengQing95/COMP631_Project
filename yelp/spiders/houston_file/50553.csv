Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I would given it 4 stars today, but because the food was subpar.  However, I used to love the food here, but today service was not the best.  I order the snooze classic with extra bacon and pineapple pancakes.  The server gave my bacon to someone else at the table.  The other person that was sitting with me did not get her bacon.  It appeared the server avoided eye contact so he did not have stop what he was doing.  I always order the pineapple pancake but this time the pancakes was a little dry.  However, the hash brown was amazing as usual!  The parking is not the best and lines are long...however, it should be expected because of the location.  I must commend today's hostess because she said the wait was 10 minutes, but we were almost seated admittedly.
