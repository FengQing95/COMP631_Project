The Pit Room////We absolutely loved and enjoyed dining at the Pit Room. Partially because of the food but also because of Nathaniel's hospitality. We wondered if he gets enough tips. He should be tipped on the front and back end. He is amazing and keeps everything going and in order. You have yourself a gem in Nathaniel. We will definitely be back.
