Kata Robata////I was invited to Kata Robata for a 10 course flight of fish and was blown away by how delicious every morsel tasted. I have Celiac and am very allergic to Gluten. They are very Celiac friendly. All soy sauce is gluten free which is huge. We had 13 different servings and all were gluten free. It really was amazing but very expensive.
