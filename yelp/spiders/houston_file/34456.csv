Local Foods////It looks like they hipped up the place since it used to be Antone's to a more modern and open decor. I don't know how accurate the local part is but the food was fresh and the service was friendly. Â I especially like their potato salad since it tasted like they make it from scratch over there (maybe they do?)...
