The Pit Room////Wow! This BBQ is to die for!! There are so many places to choose from in Texas, but this is hands down my favorite place inside the loop! They have plenty of options for meats and sides, and you can even get brisket tacos or something similar if you're not a huge BBQ fan. The taste is just so amazing, and all of the seasonings and flavors are easy to taste!
