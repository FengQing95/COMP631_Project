Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////They have a great selection of savory and sweet breakfast/brunch items on their menu. The last time I went, I kept it simple with plain pancakes, two eggs sunny side-up, and hash browns. Everything was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu items, because I was definitely eyeing the migas and French toast!
