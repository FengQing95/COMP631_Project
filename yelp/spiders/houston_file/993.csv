JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as your service is concerned, for that I do apologize. I'm not sure how or why your server would not present your check in a timely fashion when the restaurant wasn't busy, as you stated. I have had extensive conversations with all of my servers these past two days, and I can assure you these mistakes have been addressed thoroughly. We will strive to do better, thanks to folks like yourself who can bring these issues to my attention. Thank you again.
