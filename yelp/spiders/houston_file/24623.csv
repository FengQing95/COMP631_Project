Uchi////Uchi has a great happy hour. It runs from 5 - 6:30. They have a large selection of small plates, rolls, sushi and even dessert (you very rarely see sweet options on a happy hour menu). Everything is fresh and perfect. I love that every server that drops off food explains the dish to you. Linda was our main server and she was great. Very friendly and attentive. TIP: if they have the wagyu skewers when you go, Get Them. They run out quickly so maybe get 2 orders. So good!
