Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For dessert my friends and I shared the red velvet churros and the banana pudding (also shareable portions). The churros were thick pieces covered in cinnamon sugar and paired with an awesome cream cheese sauce. The banana pudding wasn't overly sweet and was topped with a hefty layer of whipped cream.
