Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I like Snooze's theme however usually, once you get your food, you're kind of unattended as there are so many people the waitstaff have to deal with. I do really appreciate their "self-service" style of billing, wish more restaurants would follow their lead! Overall, Snooze's atmosphere is the worst part about it (wait times, bit higher price for brunch food) but it makes up for it with the food!
