Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Place was really cute and I liked it, but food (Brunch) we had was not expected. I had fruity pebble french toast which drenched in condensed milk and fruity pebble was over kill.  I could bot taste any "french toast".  Breakfast burrito was very plain, yet queso was too much to eat with.
