Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My friend and I decided to give this place a try. First off. It wasn't as crowded and we were seated toward the front of the entrance which it was a chilly night that day. So you can imagine, sitting there the chilly breeze coming in after someone opened the door. Not ideal. I heard about the drinks being good so I gave that a try. They were okay and the food was mediocre as well. Towards the end of the night the music ended blasting where my friend and I couldn't hear each other. That was unnecessary for the music to gradually turn up. Anyhow. I wouldn't come back after the first visit. Thank u, next.
