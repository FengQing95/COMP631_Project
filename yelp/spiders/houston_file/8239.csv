JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've admitted before that I'm not quite that knowledgeable when it comes to ramen (even though I love it so much), but I finally understood what they meant by a broth's "depth of flavor" after coming to Jinya for the first time and trying out their Cha Cha Cha (garlic tonkotsu). I never knew that the broth could taste that......complex? That seems to be the only word I can use to describe it.
