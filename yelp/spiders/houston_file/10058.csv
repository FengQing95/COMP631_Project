JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the spicy tonkotsu ramen, pork bun, chicken karaage, gyoza, and the sukiyaki bowl. The ramen was pretty flavorful and the pork belly in the soup was very yummy. The pork bun was delicious, as expected. The karaage was delicious but the gyoza was a bit too greasy for me. The moment I bit into the gyoza, a splatter of oil cake out. My friend had the sukiyaki bowl and really enjoyed it.
