Baby Barnaby's////The huevos rancheros were outstanding. I bought black beans the next day in an attempt to see if I could mimic the experience. I think Baby Barnaby's potatoes were in some kind of global tater competition at some point. I felt as if someone announced, "Who can cook the best breakfast potatoes?" and Mr. Barnaby in diapers stepped forward and said, "Baby Barnaby's can." No idea if Mr. Barnaby is a real person, by the way. I suggested that a friend stash all the leftover potatoes in a fanny pack for later consumption.
