The Pit Room////Great place and great location. Located in the heart of Houston, this is probably one of the best BBQ places right after Killens. I love the brisket, and turkey and don't get me started on the Mac and Cheese!! The service is great and the food tasted great. A must try if you like BBQ. Prices are similar to any BBQ joint so I could not complain. Overall great place and a must try!
