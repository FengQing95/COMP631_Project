JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Angela - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your giving JINYA a try. I regret that you weren't fully pleased with your selection. Our monthly chef's specials don't always reflect the more traditional Japanese ramen selections that can be found in our menu. You mentioned the ingredients were "too heavy" and that you were expecting a "lighter, flavorful" taste. We might recommend the Spicy Chicken Ramen (Mild) the Old School Ramen or the Spicy Vegan Ramen, all of which have a lighter complexion in terms of broth and toppings. We offer more than a dozen different types of ramen bowls at JINYA, and many customers have taken more than one trip to discover the ramen that best suits their fancy.
