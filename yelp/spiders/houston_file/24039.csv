Uchi////Uchi is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. I often compare other sushi experiences to this restaurant, sometimes spoiling my own experience while I'm at other sushi restaurants. At Uchi, I like the atmosphere, the service, and the food. This place is still my favorite sushi spot in Houston -- I will spend my dollars here versus at Kata Robata or MF Sushi.
