JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We go through phases with food interests, and it was ramen's turn. In the past year, we have been on a hunt for the best ramen we could find. It just so happens that Houston has had a ramen boom in that time. We went through most if not all the ones that have popped up recently and a few of the ones that have been around for a while. I am happy to say that after going to Jinya, the search is over! Jinya is definitely the best ramen place in Houston.
