Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The parking lot is pretty small, but there is overflow parking around the block. The restaurant seating area is a decent size, also has a small outdoor patio. Customers come and go, so there's really no wait time when a table clears up (at least for the time we came ~1p). The only thing I don't like is the dessert display/order counter is right by the entrance which causes the order line to wind around close to the entrance. I don't think I'll ever understand the thought process of why some restaurants design it this way.
