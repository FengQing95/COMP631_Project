Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was nothing short of fantastic! Decent wait for a Sunday morning brunch spot...about 45 minutes but completely worth the wait. Had the breakfast burrito and the green salsa over the top of the burrito was especially delicious. Fully met my expectations and will return often.
