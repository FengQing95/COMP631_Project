Uchi////This is a restaurant that really needs no introduction. I have been here several times and every time it's a new experience. The service is always great and the food ridiculous good. The only issue I have is that in frequenting this place, I have my favorite staple dishes that are a must have. Over the past few months they have changed around some of my favorites and the flavor profiles have changed some for the good and others for the not so good. They have also taken things off the menu that I absolutely loved, but can still order off the menu. (Happy about that) All in all this is a solid place with a great atmosphere.
