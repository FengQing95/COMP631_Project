Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First time at this location! Went on Sunday for their brunch. Great location near the galleria. Parking is limited because it's in a shopping center. Valet is available. Brunch wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Great set up and atmosphere. Enjoyed that they had a Dj set up to play music. The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about their menu. We started off with their mimosa craft. Definitely was feeling the buzz, great orange to champagne ratio. We started off with the pork belly tacos and short rib chilaqules. I would definitely choose the short rib over the tacos. It came with 4 small tacos. Great for sharing. Tortilla, eggs, salsa verde and pork belly. With a side of Greek yogurt. I enjoyed it but felt like it was missing something in flavor. Coming from a Hispanic background, I'm picky on my tortilla. Definitely, wish it was more authentic. The short rib was a great mix! Â Loved the seasoning and the portion was huge. Both dishes are nicely prepared. Finally, we indulge in their famous fruity pebbles French toast. It was something I wanted to try and was worth it. It is overly sweet for one person so I would suggest sharing. I can't wait to go back for more!
