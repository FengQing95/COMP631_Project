Local Foods////I went in because I saw such great reviews for this place. I ordered the Truffled Egg Salad and the Winter Vegetable Bisque. For my taste, the truffled egg Â itself was pretty standard and the soup was just not for me. But the Pretzel Bun.... They could slab anything on it and I'm pretty sure it would taste amazing. Overall I was pleased and filled. Guy that worked there was nice and super helpful as well. Made some great recommendation ( Falafel, Crunchy Chicken, Arugula, Quinoa and Kale). Definitely coming back.
