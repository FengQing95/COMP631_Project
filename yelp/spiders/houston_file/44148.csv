Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Salmon Tartine - A very generous slice of multi-grain bread topped with a chopped onion dressing, arugula, smoked salmon, and pickled cucumbers. To be honest, it was delicious but very hard to eat without the help of a fork and knife. If you can manage to fit in a big bite, then good for you. If you have a small mouth like me, it's probably better to cut into it. The flavors are great, the onion spread tasted like a mayonnaise and cream cheese mix, but i'm not quite sure what it was. The pickled onions balanced out the saltiness and creaminess with a bit of pickled sweetness.
