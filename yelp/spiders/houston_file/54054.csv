Kata Robata////My friends and I were super excited about this place because we read reviews online and our peers told us they have great food here so we all have it a try. First thing that happened was when we came in, both hostesses were SUPER rude. When we first walked in, I said "we had a reservation for 3" and the host said "name?" in a very rude tone. She then said "ok just a few minute your table is being clean off".
