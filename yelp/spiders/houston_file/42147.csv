Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is the best place to buy your breakfast pastries in the area! They have amazing selection of baked sweets which will help you start your day right. A couple times a week I stop there to pick up my favorite almond croissants, and every time it is like a new discovery to me. The good bonus on their side is that their morning lines are pretty fast and I never have to wait more than 5 minutes to get what I want. The evening scene is also pretty good, but I can not comment on that since never visited it in the evening.
