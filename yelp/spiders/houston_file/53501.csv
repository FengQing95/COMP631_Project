Kata Robata////About the food. I loved that the spicy tuna roll was made without mayo, a condiment that has become all too ubiquitous in most American sushi restaurants. I also liked that you could order sushi by the piece, so that you can mix it up. Seems like most sushi restaurants offer sushi in two piece servings, and I thought this was a nice change. All of the sushi that I ordered was cut properly, the texture was good, and the taste...very fresh. And the price was right! Not sure why everyone thinks this place is so expensive. My girlfriend and I had a glass of wine each, steamed mussels, 2 rolls, and several pieces of sushi and the whole thing was $50! And I took a look at the happy hour specials. Rolls for 4 bucks??? I will definitely be back!
