Kata Robata////Amazing spot. Sushi is fresh. They don't overload their rolls with rice which allows you to taste everything well. The cod is really good and the lunch has a huge value attached to it. You get salad, teriyaki chicken, California roll (kinda bland imho...why not do a tempura or something)
