Uchi////I read over the previous reviews and I feel that I am being redundant at this point, but I cannot give this place a high enough review.  My family and I (a party of 5) had reservations for 7:30 tonight for a celebration dinner.  We arrived early and, despite the place being packed, they were able to seat us as soon as everyone arrived.  None of us had been here before so we asked the waitress to bring out some of her favorites.  She did not disappoint and everything was utterly magnificent.  We all eat out regularly and every one of us agreed that this was not only the best sushi that we had ever had, but probably the best meal any of us had ever had.  It is pricey, but so so worth it (and I am generally not the type of person to say that). If you are in Houston, just check it out.  You will not be disappointed.
