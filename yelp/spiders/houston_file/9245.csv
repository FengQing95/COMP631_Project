JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen is overrated. Specifically, the broth. I don't think it's flavored at all; super bland. Their chashu is delicious though. No question about that. But I judge a lot on a ramen based on their broth. We also got the pork belly, and it was delicious! Very flavorful and juicy. I would recommend to get the pork belly! I got the panna cotta; it's a disappointment. Overall, not bad. Mediocre ramen. Plus, our server was not very attentive.
