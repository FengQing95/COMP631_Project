The Pit Room////Are y'all kidding me? The best BBQ while travel throughout Texas for a week. I recommend the turkey, jalape√±o cheddar sausage and the elote! Mac and cheese was incredible as well. Worth the waiting in line (which moves pretty fast) These people have it going on. A must for BBQ while visiting Houston, TX.
