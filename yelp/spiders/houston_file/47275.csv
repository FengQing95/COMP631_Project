Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wasn't a fan of pancakes until I took the first bite of chocolate molten pancakes from snooze. The rich decadent pancake puts any other pancake you have ever had to shame! This place had a great atmosphere and a bit of a wait but it is well worth it. It is my new fav brunch spot in the Houston area! I'm looking forward to trying all of their other delicious looking menu items!
