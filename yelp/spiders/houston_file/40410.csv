Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food is mediocre to be honest. Â Service was less than mediocre. Didn't even give us water when we sat down. Traveling from NYC & I looked up best brunch in Houston. Was really excited to eat good southern breakfast. Everything was JUST OKAY nothing spectacular or maybe I'm just a picky New Yorker.
