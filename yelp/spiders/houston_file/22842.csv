Uchi////So this was a quick (not really) impromptu early birthday dinner for sister before she headed back to NYC. I will say that it was short notice so I did not make reservations, yes, faux pas indeed. ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION. We waited just about 1 1/2 hours for a 4-top. Sister was almost livid. :( I repeatedly assured her it would be worth it. And oh was it. Honestly, by the time we were seated we were eyeing the 10 course chef tasting. Go big or go home right? Yes, it would be pricey, but sister was hangry. John, our wonderman of a server, understood the pain. He actually offered to do a 10 course for us that would be a little cheaper than the set menu price. Yes, we will have that please.
