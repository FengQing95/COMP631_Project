JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was good, my two-stars review is solely on service, took my sister for her birthday, and requested the waitress to bring her the tofu pudding with a candle on it at the end so we can sing for her. She said they don't have candles, ok no biggie, we can still sing. Then she brought out the pudding and just set it on the table while we were still eating!!! I specifically told her after we were done, she ruined the surprise, we were all confused so we just started singing while we still had food in our mouth!!!
