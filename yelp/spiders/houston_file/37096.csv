Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We visited for Saturday brunch and were very lucky to have Jose as our waiter; he has fantastic enthusiasm and is extremely knowledgeable about each item on the menu, including the over 300 whiskeys! The atmosphere is phenomenal with slide open garage doors, a large bar, group seating as well as small seating. We ordered the Donut Burger and Totchos. The Donut Burger is a delicious combination of sweetness with savory. The Totchos are exactly what you expect, yummy nachos with tots instead of chips. Great atmosphere + great food = Great restaurant.
