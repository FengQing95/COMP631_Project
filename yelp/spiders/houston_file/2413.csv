JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I actually found this spot on Yelp during a visit to Houston as being a local restaurant close to my airbnb. The establishment itself has a nice aura and vibe to it. I'd definitely consider bringing a woman there as a date option. I had the spicy chicken ramen with the added ground chicken and egg. Definitely enjoyed it. Portion could of been bigger but I'm admittedly greedy and just like to eat LoL. Probably sizeable enough for the avg person.
