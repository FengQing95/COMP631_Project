JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Really great bowl of ramen! The pork melts in your mouth and the egg was divine. And if one bowl isn't enough (it was the perfect size for me) you can get a refill of noodles to finish off your broth for just $2 more. We started with the house special pork buns but the potstickers looked good too.
