Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Quick tips: This Parisian bakery makes all my troubles go away. Get there early on a Saturday or Sunday. I believe their main menu changes, but the torta, pain perdu and yogurt are my three of my favorite choices (see appropriate mood details below on what to order). Croissants are also delicious. Be careful as they have tight parking and may sell out of your favorite item. So see first quick tip - get there early! Last note, it is obvious they take a lot of care and pride in their pastries and the prices reflect that.
