The Pit Room////I tried this place late on a Sunday afternoon so they were out of brisket, which I really wanted to try. I opted for the chopped beef and a couple of types of sausage, along with potato salad and beans. If you like very spicy meat, this place is for you, but it wasn't so much to my taste. The sides were well made and overall the preparation was good. Just not a fan of BBQ this spicy. I may go back and try the ribs for a second sampling. As mentioned previously, it's a little bit pricier than other BBQ joints.
