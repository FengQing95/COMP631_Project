Local Foods////You don't need quality sides with a sandwich like that!  But they have them, a variety of delicious salads with high-quality, fresh ingredients.  I have a vendetta against kale, but their kale I ate like a kid trying to earn dessert.  I'm skeptical of frou-frou coleslaws, theirs I munched on like I was at a BBQ place.  Magic.  It's all magical.
