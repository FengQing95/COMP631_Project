Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond has wonderful pastries, decent coffee and weak savory options. The lines are long but they move quickly. The service is solid albeit impersonal. The decor is clean but uninspired. Not the place to meet new people, nor a good date spot. Come with friends, enjoy the comfortable seating, and partake in the solid music selection. But I'd hang around for perhaps half an hour at most.
