Uchi////Lawdy lawd... Uchi is pretty amazing. If you can afford it or is lucky enough to get taken for your b-day, I highly recommend it. I'm definitely more of a quantity over quality guy and am not really picky about what I eat, so the price kept me away from this place. Depending on the size of your appetite, don't expect to get super full, fast. Each dish was delicately put together and timed perfectly so you really get to enjoy the interesting pairings for each dish. I don't remember what we had, but everything we ordered was great. Only reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because of how expensive it was. Interesting enough, we saw a family bring their kids here. That's how you know you rich! When you don't feed your kids Chinese food from the restaurant down the street, but instead, food from here. That's like bringing a 2 year old to Disneyworld... Anyway, it's GOOD....
