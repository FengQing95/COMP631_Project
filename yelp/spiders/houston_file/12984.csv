JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Allan - Thank you for your review. While we may disagree on who makes the best ramen in Houston. I know we can agree on this: In the great state of Texas, H-Town is fast becoming the epicenter of excellent, authentic Japanese ramen, and with more ramen-dedicated shops looming on the horizon, Houstonians now have more choice, and that, ultimately, is a GREAT thing.
