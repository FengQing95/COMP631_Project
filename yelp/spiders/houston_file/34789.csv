Local Foods////Yum yum yum! The Winter Harvest Salad with Shrimp is incredible! Great portion size and fresh veggies tossed with just the right amount of dressing. The brussels sprouts in particular were perfectly cooked and they did not skimp on the shrimp! Also had the Gumbo Entree with Chicken, which was tasty but I was obsessed with the salad. (Luckily for me, the boo preferred the gumbo so I didn't have to share it). It gets super busy here, but there's a decent amount of seating. Cute spot, will definitely be back for more salad!
