JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've only had Japanese Ramen at a handful of places in Houston, but I'd have to say that Jinya has some of the best tasting ramen I've had so far in Houston.  When you walk into the restaurant, it's very modern, but very cozy.  The wait to get seated during lunch on a Thursday was not bad at all.  The menu has a very good selection of items, but my goal for this lunch outing was the Jinya No.2 ramen.  This was a spicy chicken ramen instead of the standard braised pork.  The ramen was delicious and the broth was very flavorful.  I didn't add too many extras since I wanted to try the No. 2 just the way it was.  For dessert I ordered the green tea mochi ice cream.  I've had this before in other restaurants and it was just the same.  The restaurant was clean, waitstaff was attentive, the food came out in a timely manner, and the food was delicious.  My only real complaint, which really isn't a complaint, is that I don't understand why all of these restaurants have the going rate for ramen at about $10.  My wife and I have had authentic ramen in Japan, which still has yet to be beat by anything we've had in Houston, and it costs just about half as much.  Maybe you're paying for the ambiance?  Maybe it's the growing popularity of Japanese ramen?  In any case, Jinya was pretty good and i'm eager to compare it to some of the other ramen spots around the city.  One other thing to note, for being close to Midtown, there is free parking in the garage behind the restaurant, so that is a definite PLUS for me!
