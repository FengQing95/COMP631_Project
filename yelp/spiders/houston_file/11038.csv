JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I regret that your server was overwhelmed to the point of providing you with bad service. If you opt to visit us again, please ask for a manager who will ensure that this does not happen again. While I appreciate your candor, I take umbrage with your comment that our server was "underwhelmed by life in general." Everyone in our restaurant works extremely hard, and at the end of the day our reputation is all that we have. We rely on this reputation to pay for our bills and to feed ourselves and our families. I would presume the same goes for every ramen shop in Houston, as well.
