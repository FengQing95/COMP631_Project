JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After living in Japan for three years, it will be hard to impressed me with ramen that is from a US location. We order the goyza first, i was more impress that it was homemade instead of frozen. It was tasty and filling. When the ramen came out, it was a large portion. Pork was so tender and most importantly the egg was near orange and the yolk was running. It is as close to a ramen shop in Japan.
