Local Foods////I think the food here could be better. Everyone raves about the kale salad but its not spectacular to me. And I am someone who likes kale. It was, how do I say it, exactly what kale salad should taste like? at least, that is how I make my kale salad at home. I like that they carry caphine. I like the atmosphere, but then I feel like its a place to "be seen". Not that much into it. Yelpers rave about homemade chips but i didn't like it that much. Sorry, just being an honest foodie.
