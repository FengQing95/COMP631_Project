Uchi////Makimono: On the happy hour menu, they are $6 each compared to twice as much on the regular menu. I especially enjoyed the crunchy spicy tuna and shag roll. I'm usually not a roll person but I thought these were very well executed. They are not gigantic, rather they are cut into dainty pieces. The fish that they use is not the mashed up dregs that other restaurants employ. I had whole chunks of fresh fish. I even liked the light tempura frying of the shag roll (not greasy at all!). I did not enjoy the ham and eggs roll as much. The pork and thick sauces were just too heavy to work as sushi.
