Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was good. The plates that the food were served on were tiny compared to the portions. I got food all over the table and my clothing. The noise level is so loud.  I was there for brunch and they had a live singer and it was crowded and I could barely hear myself think. I was growing hoarse from shouting across the table at my friends (no exaggeration)!  I'm too old for this on a Sunday morning. Anyone with a hangover should stay away for Sunday brunch.  Other than that the staff was lovely and accommodating. Oh and the bathrooms are different. Be prepared, they are not what you expect. I had the fruity pebbles French toast, the fries( awesome) and the breakfast tacos. The fries were awesome everything else was good. Their Bloody Mary was decent.
