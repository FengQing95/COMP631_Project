Baby Barnaby's////The first time I ate here I had the banana walnut pancake which is a very large thick rectangular pancake. It is very 'cakey' and falls apart like cornbread does. If you like this style of pancake then you will love this one. Personally I like my pancakes with a healthy balance of cakeiness and density. I preferred the waffle but the pancake is good.
