JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen is hard for me to explain because I am pretty sensitive to grease. The Tankotsu had a lot of floating grease (orange grease....) and the soup definitely tasted greasy. The pork tasted oven roasted which made it really tender and juicy. The recommended corn fit perfectly with the creamy soup. I say creamy, but the soup itself was not thick. I think I just ordered the wrong thing because pork is known to be greasy and I should have really considered that when ordering. Next time I go, I'll be getting a miso or vegetable soup base.
