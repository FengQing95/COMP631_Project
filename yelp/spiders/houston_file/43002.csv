Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Raspberry macarons FTW! I brought my little nieces here and they loved it! Parking sucks, but it's worth fighting your way in the cramped lot to get some lovely desserts. It's pretty pricey here but that just ensures I don't overindulge. I wish Dallas had more places like this. Just another reason why Houston is better than Dallas...
