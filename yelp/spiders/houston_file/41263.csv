Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I visited this place twice once with my husband and once with my best friend. Each time I've had the croissant and I have loved it. It is always busy but that's because it isn't a great market. The staff are fast and the setting is very quaint. The raspberry jam they serve with the croissants are so delicious I have to buy a jar of it. It is a good place to go for very good pastries.
