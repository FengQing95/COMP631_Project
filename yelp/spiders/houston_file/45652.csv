Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We stopped by here for a quick breakfast and were very happy with our meal! There are several pastries to choose from including macarons, kouign amann, bread and many more! We didn't try the pastries but I will definitely come back again to try them in the future. We tried the iced coffee which was a little bitter, but not bad. We had the chicken and biscuits and quiche lorraine. The side salad with the quiche was fresh and had a great dressing! The quiche was tasty but it was a bit greasy. All in all I will definitely frequent this spot in the future. Highly recommend!
