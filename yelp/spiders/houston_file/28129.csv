The Pit Room////I was in town on business, had done enough homework to want to try this place and had the flexibility to time my visit. I chose to go at around 3:30 and I waited only a matter of minutes. I had three meats and 2 sides, washed down with a local bottled beer, all very good. The brisket was moist with a nice pink smoke ring and the Czech-style beef sausage is made in house and really tasty with a nice snap. I ate outside in solitude and was checked on twice by a super nice employee. You can bring your meal next door to The Patio, as they are under the same auspices.
