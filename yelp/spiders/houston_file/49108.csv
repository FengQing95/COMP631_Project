Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY TRIP TO HOUSTON SO FAR. Eat the chili verde benny. I'm still thinking about it three days later, and I want it in my mouth. The Bloody Mary selection is DA BOMB and the spicy Mary makes my mouth water. Also, you can add bacon to any Mary, which if you don't, you don't have a soul.
