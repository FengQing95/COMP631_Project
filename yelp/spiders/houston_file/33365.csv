Local Foods////The reason I've bumped the rating to 4 stars versus 3 is because of the sides. My mom and I both really loved the kale with golden raisins, parmesan, and pine nuts. I can appreciate this dish as those are expensive ingredients that I wouldn't normally keep on hand or think to pair with each other. Our favorite side was the cabbage slaw which was the only dish we tasted with a bit of a different flavor profile. It featured a mix of green and red cabbage with edamame and seaweed in a sesame dressing, so it had a bit of an Asian flair.
