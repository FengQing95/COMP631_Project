JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friends and I tried to get in here on a Saturday night.  We called ahead and they told us that there shouldn't be a wait at 8pm.  When we got there at 8, they said it would be a 45 minute wait.  We hung around for a few minutes and then gave up and went somewhere else.  Fortunately for JINYA, their food looked so good that my fiance and I decided to give it another shot the very next day.
