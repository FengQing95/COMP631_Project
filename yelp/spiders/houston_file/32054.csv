Local Foods////Definitely a lunch go to.  Was completely full but establishment did great job and delivering food to our table leaving time to trek back to the worksite about 15 mins away during a 1-hr lunch break.  I ate the Shrimp/Crab ciabatta and was an amazing sandwich.  Even better paired with a squash soup as a side.  Also, great drink choices.  I normally look for mineral water during my non-alcoholic meals and they served both a lime-based and normal mineral water out of glass bottle.  All for less than $17.
