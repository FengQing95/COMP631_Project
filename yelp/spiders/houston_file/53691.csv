Kata Robata////The dessert was the best part. They switch out their desserts once in awhile since the pastry chef likes experimenting. I had the frozen vanilla bean + mango dessert. It came with 5-6 different things on the plate (vanilla bean ice cream, diced mangoes, honey whip, cocoa crumble, cilantro oil, frozen mango mousse rocks). Each ingredient tasted really good on its alone, but when you combine all of them in one bite... MIND. BLOWING. Maybe I'm a little biased since mangoes and vanilla bean ice cream are my two favorite things ever, but it was seriously good.
