Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had gone for brunch and enjoyed the omelet.  This week I met a friend for lunch and we both had salads, which were very disappointing.  I ordered  mine with chicken which was soaked in a gooey sauce (just assumed it would be grilled, should have read menu more closely), my friend added salmon to his,.  The salmon was so over cooked, I actually thought it was a breadstick at first.   He managed to eat it but it was beyond dry and tough.
