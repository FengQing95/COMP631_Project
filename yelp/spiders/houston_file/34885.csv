Local Foods////You just can't go wrong local foods. This is definitely the place to go if you want healthy, but delicious, flavorful foods. There is truly no salad place in Houston that serves salads quite as unique and fresh as local foods. They use seasonal ingredients for certain salads. The sandwiches are just as incredible with an impeccable pretzel bun and amazing sides. Though it it pricier than your average salad, you will leave feeling very full.
