Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I gave this place another try and I have to say this is a must for anyone visiting or living in Houston. The food is really good! The brunch especially is an experience but if a late night dinner is better for you STILL GO! The food is so delicious. For brunch, I had the apple cheesecake waffle and it was really rich and the apples tasted fresh! The chicken fried steak was huge and it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The chicken sausage was SO GOOD! (I almost ordered another one!) The vibe was so fun and the music was enjoyable because it was a lot of 2000s pop! Highly highly recommend!
