Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Their pancake flights are great, but the wait isn't necessarily worth it. I haven't had the best service here (long wait and then my order was incorrect when it arrived), and I am not a big fan of the coffee. But if you like pancakes, they have a great selection with unique toppings!
