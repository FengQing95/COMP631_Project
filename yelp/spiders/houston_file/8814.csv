JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So good, worth the hype that my friends made it to be. I just wish I had more... I usually do not go out to eat due to it being costly and unhealthy. However, my boyfriend and I have been here twice in less than one month. Plus, they have Kirin Ichiban, which is one of our favorite beers!
