Kata Robata////The food here is good. It's nothing amazing but the restaurant is cute and trendy. My friend loves this restaurant and insisted on eating here for her birthday, over other fancier restaurants. I called numerous times the day before and left messages to reserve a table for her birthday. I arrived before my friend and made sure to tell them it was her birthday and to add a candle on the dessert. I made sure to tell the hostess it was a big birthday. They assured me a candle would be added. It did not happen. They did not put a candle on her dessert and the waitress did not wish my friend a happy birthday. I am very disappointed after my numerous request, they failed to make my friend's birthday special. I would not suggest this place for any special occasions. I am not a returning customer after today.
