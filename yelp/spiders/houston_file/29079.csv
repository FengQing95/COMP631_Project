The Pit Room////Wowowow I'm so glad yelp led me here, because it was everything I wanted it to be and more.  I went here the first day I landed in Houston and am eagerly looking forward to the next time I'll be back.  It's your basic barbecue place-- pick your meat & two sides, but everything is done so well.
