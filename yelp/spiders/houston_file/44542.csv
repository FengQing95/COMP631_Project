Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I waited in the insanely long line (right after they opened, too) and ordered a chocolate chip cookie and the gigantic almond croissant with a tea. The tea was fine. The chocolate chip cookie was gooey and delicious, as it should be. The croissant was--I hate to say it--almost too flakey? I don't know, maybe I'm weird, but it was too messy and although the flavor was good, I think I just prefer what they serve up at French Riviera because it's easier to eat.
