JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have been to a number of ramen restaurants in Houston and Jinya is in my top two. My overall favorite ramen place is Santouka ramen usually found inside Mitsuwa grocery stores. Unfortunately, Houston does not have one. The ramen was good with a well flavored broth and pork. The noodles were perfect and to my liking. Overall a good experience! I enjoyed the atmosphere and the restaurant staff. Depending on when you go the wait maybe long... I originally went on a Friday night and was told the wait was 45 minutes for a party of 2. I decided not to wait and went next door to the pizza place because I was hungry. I should not have done that. I was really disappointed. I returned Saturday afternoon Jinya and left happy! I will be back to Jinya
