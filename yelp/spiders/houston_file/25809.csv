The Pit Room////I have been to the pit room twice - honestly I do not know what the big deal is.  I think it is quite mediocre.  I had the chicken and brisket the first time.  I thought the brisket was dry and the chicken nothing special.  Then Texas Monthly can out so I figured I just caught them on an off night.  The next timeI had the brisket chicken and ribs.  Again I thought each was nothing special.  There is a good beer selection however.
