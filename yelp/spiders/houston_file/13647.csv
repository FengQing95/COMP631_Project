JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Mattie - Thank you for your review. I regret that you did not feel safe dining inside our restaurant. We are allowed 75% capacity seating inside our restaurant per city, state and local guidelines. And since the very first day that Gov. Abbott reopened restaurants for dine-in, we have been visited repeatedly by city inspectors who have reviewed and approved our seating arrangements.
