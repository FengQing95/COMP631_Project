Uchi////The local take on Hamachi Kama (simplified Hama Kama) is plucky, but doesn't materially distort how wonderful Hamachi Kama is.  The flavouring/seasoning is zesty, and paired with Gochu-Jang dipping sauce, so it's a bit heavier than "usual" but it's effective.  Other offerings in the fusion side of the menu are in line with this - variations/evolutions of wa-shoku that remain extensions that are true to the fish.  Zesty and spicy, but not covering the natural flavours of the materiel.
