Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was looking for a brunch restaurant and came across Bosscat on yelp. Had to give it a try. There was 5 of us on a Saturday morning. I think we had to wait a few minutes. Had some interesting things on the menu. I started with a Bloody Mary. My brunch choice was avacado toast and added an egg for an extra $2. It was basic, nothing special. My friends ordered fruity pebbles French toast, Maui meatloaf, old faithful, donut burger and shrimp and grits. The fruity pebbles French toast was very very good and full of diabetes. Haha. But it was really good. Taking more than a few bites is enough. Maui meatloaf was good. Basically a loco moco. Service was pretty good. The place had good vibes. Highly recommended for brunch.
