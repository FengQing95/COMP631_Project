Uchi////Uchi is just Fabulous.  Our server was Ms. Amy and she did an amazing job taking good care of me and my friend Judy.  We celebrated both of our birthdays coming up in style and in the Uchi way.   The Chef and Manager came to our table to make sure we had all we needed.  They made us feel right at home and like Queens!   The food of course was outstanding as usual.  And I left fully content and excited to go back again soon.
