Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The ambiance is nice, has a rustic and chill vibe. I've seen a pretty diverse crowd here from young professionals to a business crowd to elderly couples doing a date night out. Know what really stands out to me though? The staff. Every single person I've encountered is friendly, courteous, helpful, and honest. I've watched the assistant managers, managers, and owners serve food and pack up food alongside their wait staff. I highly appreciate being able to watch a team work so well together and work alongside one another like that. It's a rare find and it translates in the service given.
