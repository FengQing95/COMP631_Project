JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place was very cool.  We went on a weeknight and it was packed but the ramen was good.  I'm not a big noodle person but I was game to try it.  The staff was friendly.  We sat at the long community table in the center of the resturant and I ordered veg ramen.  Overall I had no complaints and I would go back again.
