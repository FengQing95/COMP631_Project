Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went on a Saturday night and the place was busy but we were seated pretty quickly. We went with the poutine and the short rib flatbread. For starters, these were surprisingly a lot of food (which is a good thing!). The poutine is somewhat heavy with all the pork and cheese, but it was definitely good. The short rib with pickled onions on top was nice too. Had a couple drinks as well.
