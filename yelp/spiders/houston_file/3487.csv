JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We really liked this place although we were probably the oldest people in there. And we are 30. The fried Brussels sprouts were yummy. The portion was small. The pot stickers were good too. I had the spicy ramen and my husband had the classic. Both were absolutely delicious. Rivaling the best ramen we have had. And be sure to get egg. :) yummers. Thanks!
