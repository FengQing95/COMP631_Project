Kata Robata////As for the food on the regular menu, I got some special sashimi pieces (pics below), lobster Mac and cheese, and black cod. My fave of these items was the black cod. The texture and flavor were unforgettable. It was unexpectedly sweet, which was really good with a hint of lemon juice. I am drooling just thinking about it! Lobster Mac and cheese was good but it wasn't mesmerizing. This was my second time eating it, and both times I wasn't impressed.
