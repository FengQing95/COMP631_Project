Kata Robata////Went last night for a date night dinner. Was not either of our first time, so we were expecting the same great experience we have had before. Sadly we had terrible service. Waited over fifteen minutes before flagging down a random waitress to take our drink order. Then waitress only came to our table twice after that and one of those times was just to give us the ticket. Poor service, terrible. Food was mediocre, not good enough to excuse the service. The only highlight was their amazing tomago, honestly the only think that would make me want to come back. But I'd sit at the sushi bar.
