JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I loveee a good bowl of ramen, but not enough to drive all the way down to the depths of Clear Lake for it. Needless to say, I was ecstatic when JINYA finally set up its 2nd shop right here ITL ("inside the loop," for those not fluent in Yelp-ish). The ramen bar takes up the space that was formerly Sushi Raku, and it looks great: lots of wood and brick accents, huge bar occupying the lobby area while you wait, booths for couples and medium-sized parties, and two large community tables under some cool-looking light fixtures. At 8:45pm on a Saturday night, the wait was pretty lengthy, but they give you a buzzer so you're free to walk around - maybe grab some coffee around the corner at Dolce Delights or chill in your car in the garage. When our buzzer finally went off, the hostess tried corralling us over towards the community table when there was a perfectly-sized booth open right next to us. After waiting for 45mins, that was SO not happening. Nice try though, booboo!
