The Pit Room////Still good quality and the customer service is actually getting even better. I had the mixed meat plate with pulled pork and turkey -- absolutely delicious. The sides are generous. My favorite is the cucumber and tomato salad, but their new corn pudding is a very close second - and who can eat bbq without potato salad -- definitely not me.
