JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is the best ramen in Houston. I crave it on a weekly basis. I bring all my friends here. The waitstaff now recognizes me, which is a dubious honor but one I hold proudly. My favorite bowl is the Tonkatsu White. I used to love the fatty, heavy broth typical of the Black but hate the feeling of being a giant jiggly blob after I down the bowl. The White strikes a balance between deep flavor and a sense of lightness/delicacy. Regardless of the flavor you choose, your bowl will be excellent. The noodles are always perfectly cooked with excellent texture and the sides (I don't remember the Japanese names off the top of my head...but I'm talking about the soft boiled egg, seaweed, pork belly etc) are all well portioned and super tasty. The bowl perfectly fills me up; if I'm feeling a little hungrier I might order some of the appetizers but while they're tasty, they're no where near the level of the ramen.
