Uchi////This place is a whole culinary experience. I came here for a birthday during a weekday and I was definitely not prepared for how amazing this place is. Our waiter Nick guided us through the process and recommended plates as we went and he did not miss! I did not try anything that I didn't like. I wish I could remember everything I tried but it was too much. I have to say the lychee natsu drink, uchi salad and the foi gras are a must try!!! The foi gras is literally an explosion of flavor in your mouth. I cannot recommend it enough.
