Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Ate dinner at Bosscat tonight and it was AWESOME. Terry, our server, was incredible... dinner and a show! Five Star meal, five star service, five star cocktails, and 4.5 stars for ambiance (0.5 deduction for how loud it was). If you want whisky and a good meal, this is your place!
