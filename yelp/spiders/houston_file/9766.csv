JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went to go watch the lion king, and was looking for a nice place to eat around the area. Discovered this place by luck, and saw just how many reviews it had, so being an elite, I had a legal obligation to check it out lol. First I'd like to mention that the atmosphere in this place is very lively. The servers like to yell out some word every 2 minutes. Everyone's very happy and the seating is also interesting. It's basically a long table that everyone can sit at. Now to the food. I had the spicy miso ramen. It was absolutely delicious. Broth was a perfect spice for me. Noodles are perfect and the beef also perfect. This was a tie for first place with my other favorite ramen place, which is in DC. Also ordered some pork gyoza. Gyoza was fresh and had great texture. Would also recommend getting the curry with rice. A nice little side item to have with your soup. Overall A+!!
