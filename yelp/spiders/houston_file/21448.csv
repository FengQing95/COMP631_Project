Uchi////Overall, we had a fantastic experience of flavors in our mouth...with one exception: dessert. As my husband put it, "it's like they took all the awesomeness of dessert and ruined it every way they could!" This was in reference to using basil as a sorbet and dehydrating perfectly good chocolate. We ate it, but it (quite literally) left a funny aftertaste in our mouths.
