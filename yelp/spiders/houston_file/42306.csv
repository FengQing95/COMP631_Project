Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here twice and both times were a mad house. Based on the popularity of this place, Houstonians sure love their pastries and brunch items. The first time I went here with my bf, we parked on the street after circling the block. Luckily the line wasn't out the door but there were still at least ten people ahead of us. Â The second time I went with my girlfriends, the line was out the door (we got there at 10:30am).
