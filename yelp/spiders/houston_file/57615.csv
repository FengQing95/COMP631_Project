Kata Robata////My favorite pieces were the West Coast (Santa Barbara?) and Japanese uni. Each had their own distinct flavor. I really can't say which one I liked better because they were both so good. These uni pieces and the toro uni caviar were ridiculously good. The toro blew me away - best tasting sushi piece ever - it was amazing!
