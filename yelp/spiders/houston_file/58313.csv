Baby Barnaby's////Wife and I had a great breakfast on a cold, for Houston, morning. Be sure to write your name on the clipboard if you don't want to be skipped. I really liked that they give you a pitcher of water and coffee on the table...less waiting for caffeine when you are recovering from the night before. We both had the French toast and it was great. We sat outside and the wait at 9am was about 5-10 minutes. You can drink coffee while you wait so it feels like an extended breakfast. The patio says dog friendly but there were no pooches on our visit.
