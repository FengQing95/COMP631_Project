Kata Robata////I chose Kata Robata to throw my girlfriend a surprise birthday dinner based on a friend's recommendation. Having never been here and being a control freak, I was definitely a bit nervous about how this would unfold. Fortunately our experience was very good, overall. The decor was impressive and the music and level of noise wasn't intrusive.
