Baby Barnaby's////Came here because of all the reviews on yelp and was not disappointed. The service is really what sets this place apart from other restaurants. It was very family style and the staff make you feel right at home even calling you by name during your visit. The table next to us recommended the Green Eggs for our first visit and they were fantastic. We will definitely be going back!
