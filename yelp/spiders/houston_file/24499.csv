Uchi////Uchi is an experience. I have come during happy hour before and it is quite reasonable. I normal hate brussel sprouts, but I cannot get enough at Uchi-- they are fantastic and so full of flavor! The chicken karrage is crispy, hot, and salty and a must for me as well. All the sushi pieces and fish have been superb. Their desserts are visually beautiful and taste great. Because it can normally be quite expensive, it is more of a special occasion sort of place, but I have always been pleased with the service and food here.
