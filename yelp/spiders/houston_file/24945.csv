Uchi////I've eaten at a table and the sushi bar and both are really great experiences. I had a great dining experience being served by Santo, a sushi chef, who was so funny and an excellent fish slicer. The head Sushi chef is great too. It's really fun to watch them make all the sushi with such precision but also having so much fun doing it.
