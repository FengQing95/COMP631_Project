Local Foods////The sandwich I got was the gulf shrimp & blue crab sandwich which was delish as the seafood was very fresh-tasting. However, I would say the flavoring of the shrimp & crab could be better as I find the flavoring light. Yes, the lighter the flavoring, the better you can taste the freshness of the seafood, but it would hurt to add more flavors. However, I did enjoy and will consider getting the same again. I also want to go back and try the other sandwiches which all now have high expectations!
