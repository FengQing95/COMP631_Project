Baby Barnaby's////This place is adorable- a slightly quirky, slightly run down diner in the middle of an equally quirky Montrose-y neighborhood (though Yelp says I was in the 4th ward. Huh, who knew?) As this location only does breakfast, they have it down to a science- ice water and coffee carafe already on the table when you sit down. The menu is a one-pager with an adorable logo on the back (see photo), and is mostly egg and meat related dishes (though I saw waffles as well.)
