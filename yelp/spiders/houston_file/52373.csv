Kata Robata////I believe this is the same entrepreneurs of Azuma and Soma Sushi, Chef Horiuchi is a combination of traditional and modern Japanese cuisine and I THINK he used to be at Soma. In my opinion Soma has gone down in quality, and this is my new favorite sushi place. I'm a roll lover and all the rolls i've tried here are absolutely delish! I also went here to meet some friends for a couple of bottles of wine, but didn't eat. The staff was seriously attentive. Almost to the point of creepiness. I was pretty sure the bus boy was going to follow me to my car! Thank goodness I wasn't there alone. I can't remember our server's name, but she was absolutely fantabulous! I'll be back to this place again and again. Doesn't hurt that it's a mile from my apt.
