JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would recommend this place! They've got a lot of things on the menu for everybody and their ramen did not disappoint. However, because we're not from the area and do not usually come to Downtown for any reason, we sadly cannot finding ourselves coming out of the way for this. But if you do work in the downtown area or frequent it a lot, consider yourself very lucky!
