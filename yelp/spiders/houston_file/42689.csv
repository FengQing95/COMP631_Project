Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////But no.  That's not how Common Bond rolls.  (See what I did there?).  We were in line for 15 minutes to only move up, I kid you not, five people.  At first I didn't notice, it was a lazy Saturday after all.  But then a foreboding crept in.  This was taking longer than it should. I stopped talking to my companion and watched the counter service.
