Local Foods////My go-to place whenever I'm in the area (which is most days of the week).  It's delicious, it's healthy, and it's reasonably priced (for the area).  I wish they would change up the menu a bit, just because I eat here so often, but otherwise I have no issues with the place for what it is.
