JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Rody - Thank you very much for the excellent review. We greatly appreciate it and the photos, too. I'm very pleased to know that your server provided good service and was helpful in explaining our menu. And you are correct: If there is ever any issue with your bowl of ramen for any reason, just let your server know and he or she will have it remade until it meets your complete satisfaction.
