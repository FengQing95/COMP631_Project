JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This isn't necessarily the best ramen I've ever had, but definitely the best ramen in Houston. I got the Spicy Tonkotsu and the bf got the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. His was a little sweeter but I liked mine better. The broth was rich and full of flavor. Definitely not lacking any flavor. They offer both thick and thin noodles which I like and an array of toppings. We also got the jinya pork belly buns which were tender and full of flavor. Stay away from the chicken and cream cheese wontons. They were a waste of space in my stomach. This place was a little pricey compared to most other ramen joints in Houston and the service was very subpar. My server didn't seem to be much help with my questions but the food cozy atmosphere and delicious ramen make up for all of that. Come here! It's no Ippudo or Tatsu-Ya but it's definitely worth the trip!
