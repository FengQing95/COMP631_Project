Uchi////Uchi is definitely the IT place for Houston when it comes to fusion sushi dishes!  from start to finish this place was amazing.  They were fully staffed and there to welcome you, keep you satisfied until your seating became available... then when they were ready to serve you received THE BEST eats ever!  We went on a Thursday night and expected a wait but honestly the time flew by with the apps, delicious drinks....... we were offered seating but decided to wait it out for the sushi bar experience... SO GLAD that we did!  Our sushi chef's name was San and created a fabulous sushi fusion experience that we enjoyed with a variety of sake and washed it all down with a cool beer.  So the food was amazing... but other perks?
