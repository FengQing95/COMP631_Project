Uchi////From the sashimi, which always shows off the fish with a hint of flavor, to the exotic dishes like the duck in a jar, you can tell that every detail has been thought out in these dishes. No flavor was misplaced or hastily added, and everything has purpose singularly and together. Trying dishes here is like exploring Japanese fusion adventure.
