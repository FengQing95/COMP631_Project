Uchi////For dessert, we ordered Fried Milk, Peanut Butter Semifreddo and Champagne Okashi.  OMG.....the Fried Milk was to die for!  I understand why it is one of the most popular items on the dessert menu.  The fried discs were a vessel for warm, creamy milk.  The Champagne Okashi was a Champagne foam with Strawberry and White Chocolate that was refreshing and totally unexpected.  And the Peanut Butter Semifreddo was a wonderful, cheesecake-like slice of heaven with an Apple-Miso sorbet.
