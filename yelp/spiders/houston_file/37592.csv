Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Cool speak easy 1920's vibe with dim yellow lighting, amble seating, heavy food for dinner options, and a really nice variety of brunch items. Monday night steak night was better than expected even though we hit a few rough spots with the temperature of the steak. If you do choose to eat here, be sure to bring your appetite! Valet parking is available but I don't remember any outdoor seating.
