JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Waiting aside, the food was delicious.  The crunchy shrimp balls tasted like it was coated in rice krispies, which oddly worked.  I enjoyed the aioli sauce that was drizzled on the plate.  The ramen itself was very good too.  After reading rave reviews on the broth, I was a tad disappointed.  It was definitely good, but in my mind it had been hyped up too much.  I added a seasoned egg to my bowl, which I enjoyed.  It was a very filling dish and I wasn't hungry at all until dinner.
