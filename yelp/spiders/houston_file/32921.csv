Local Foods////There is a great selection of local beers (try one out if you haven't had one!) by the bottle or on tap, and maybe a cocktail (check the boards). I had a cocktail and it was nicely balance between the white wine and the strawberry mintade. Also, the mintade is a great balance of citruses and really refreshing on a summer day.
