The Pit Room////I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have good bbq so close to all the things I do. I love Killens. It's my fav in Houston, but who wants to trek all the way to Pearland on the reg? Pit Room isn't better than Killens, but it's really, really, really good. And they don't mess up your order like Brookstreet. I normally get ribs and sausage with potato salad and mac and cheese, because meat and carbs. No room for veggies.
