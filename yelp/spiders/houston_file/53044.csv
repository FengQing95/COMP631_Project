Kata Robata////I ordered pizza for an office meeting and a GF pie for myself.    Possibly the best gf pizza crust I've had and I really liked the individual size.  I didn't feel yucky at all afterwards which most gf pizza places do to me and why I rarely order pizza out.   I'm looking forward to ordering GF again.
