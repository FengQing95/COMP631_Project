Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Great breakfast! As an Eggs Benedict fan, this place delivered. The sauce was great and unique, with wonderful eggs and a soft English muffin. The hashbrowns were also a wonderful surprise as they had plenty of flavor without feeling like you needed to add to them. Best of all, was the staff. Friendly and genuinely looked like they loved being there, even going as far as to get on a name basis with you. Will definitely be back!
