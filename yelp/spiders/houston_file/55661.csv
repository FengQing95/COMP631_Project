Kata Robata////1st time. Amazing. Really nice restaurant design. Great attention to architectural/interior detail. Feels delightful to be there. Take your girl. She should feel special. Scallop roll & spicy tuna way up on delicious scale. Never had oxtail soup before, but wow! "Miami Joe" smart guy with good insight. Corey has a bit of Bill Murray in him. Nice patio, though backs to side street.
