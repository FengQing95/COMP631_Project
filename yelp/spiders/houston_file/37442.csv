Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food and service here is amazingggg! A super cool whiskey room that I've never seen in Houston before. Even though I don't drink whiskey, it's definitely a cool restaurant! Love the comfort food here, very filling and flavorful! Terry, our server, was so great and attentive! So friendly and humorous ! Loved it! Will definitely come back for more delicious food, especially the red velvet churros!!
