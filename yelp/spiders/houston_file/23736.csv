Uchi////When we arrived, the front staff was super friendly and gave us an option of waiting 5-10 minutes for a table or 20-30minutes for the sushi bar. Of course, we took the option of waiting for the sushi bar. She kindly escorted us to the back patio where we could order drinks and snacks until our seats were ready. She kept checking in on us to give us an update on the status, which was great.
