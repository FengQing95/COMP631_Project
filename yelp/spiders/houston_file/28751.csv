The Pit Room////We got the Market Salad and Brisket Sandwich with the potato salad and Mac N Cheese for sides. The salad was huge, fresh, and very tasty! The brisket was very flavorful, tender and juicy. The sides were delicious and obviously homemade. You can check out how they slowly cook all the bbq and is very cool. The employees are super friendly and highly informative.
