Local Foods////Well, my review is mixed but based on my latest visit yesterday, the salad is lacking quality and freshness. I've ate here before and usually order a salad and it's actually my go to for salads but it failed me this time. I think it might be due to renovations happening inside but it's hard to return back from what was served yesterday.
