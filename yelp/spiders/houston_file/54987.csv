Kata Robata////The broth transformed. Now it match the slightly wavy ramen noodle. The broth is thick. Enough saltiness that made me end up eating the entire broth. Umai ! The topping of the pork was change from kakuni-type of pork to more traditional yakibuta (roasted pork), which provides enough flavor to give a sense of harmony between Ramen Noodl and the Broth. So Kudos to Hori-san and his team. Well done.
