Kata Robata////Pork Dom: awesome if you're looking for something really filling. It's a bowl of rice, with onions, red peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, and pork belly, topped with a poached egg. You break the egg yolk, and it oozes down and mixes in to make a yummy sauce for the rice and veggies and meat. So good, and definitely not a tapas dish.
