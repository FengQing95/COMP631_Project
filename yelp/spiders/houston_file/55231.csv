Kata Robata////I came here on the advice of The Houston "Ramen in Common" group. Me and my husband were on a ramen quest, since we're transplants from NYC and had been craving our favorite treat. Well we were quite surprised by Kata Robata! The entire experience was one to write home about. Very clean, friendly and helpful staff, AND the ramen knocked my socks off. I can't remember the sushi rolls we had , but they were amazing too. I guess they were overshadowed by the ramen :) Â suffice it to say, we will be returning very soon.
