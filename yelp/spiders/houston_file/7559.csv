JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend is a huge fan of Jinya and ordered the Jinya bao first which he devoured in seconds. I started with Asagi on draft, which was cold and nice on this warm day. Our ramen came out soon after, he stuck with the Tonkatsu black with some additions, and I had the Chef's special Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen. It was soooooo good. Just, absolutely delicious. The egg, pork, broth and noodles were just amazing. Thankfully the waitress didn't judge me for needing a fork. lol We also shared the green tea mochi, which were a simple and refreshing end to our meal.
