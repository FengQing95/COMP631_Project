Local Foods////All of their ingredients are locally/sustainably sourced from farms around Houston such as Gundermann Acres, Atkinson Farms, etc. You can really taste how fresh the ingredients are, because their dishes are very lightly seasoned. There are certain staples on the menu (i.e. crunchy chicken), but certain other menu items rotate seasonally (I still dream about the lemongrass chicken soup - PLEASE BRING IT BACK, LOCAL FOODS!!!). Portions are HUGE, but miraculously, I never feel bloated and gross after I somehow scarf down my entire meal.
