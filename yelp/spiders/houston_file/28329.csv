The Pit Room////Parking was easy and the menu is self explanatory. Unfortunately they were out of a lot of their menu. No pork ribs, no chicken, one of the sausage options and something else. We were hoping to try their feast which is basically a sampling of everything, but had to settle for ordering what was left a la carte. I'd recommend going for lunch or maybe on a weekday night when they are likely to still have all of the options.
