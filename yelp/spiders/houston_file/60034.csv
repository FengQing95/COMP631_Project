Baby Barnaby's////I have been here multiple times and well aware of the long wait and the general vibe of the place. But after today's events chances are going to be very hard to make me want to come back. After waiting over 30 minutes for a table I went to go check on the status of our seating arrangements only to see first hand that we got skipped. When I had asked the waiter why this was (mind you he had sat a table outside with enough room for my guest and our dog to sit comfortably) he stated that "they had no room for us on the patio" come guys if you're going to claim to be dog friendly at least let people with dogs know that you do not have room for them and they should go elsewhere. You not only wasted my time which was limited because we had to be somewhere, but you have left a lasting stain on this establishment. And this is sad because you guys use to be such a great place.
