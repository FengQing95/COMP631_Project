Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Meh!  The breakfast food was overpriced and blend.  Their bakery items might be better but we didn't try those.  I had scrambled eggs and paid $15 for a plate of eggs with no flavor plus it had peppers.  I hate peppers and the menu didn't say the eggs had peppers.  My hubby had the french toast and it was just ok.  It's a cute establishment but they could do better with their menu selection.
