Baby Barnaby's////I love Baby Barnaby's Cafe for breakfast. I've been on Saturdays and Sundays, where I make sure to go by 9 or 10 am because the wait is only half an hour, and I go on weekdays before work. Yes, the place is so good, I wake up early on Wednesday to get breakfast here with friends! The food is always good (love Bob's Healthy Plate) and the service is great. I've never had a bad experience here. This is my go-to Houston breakfast spot.
