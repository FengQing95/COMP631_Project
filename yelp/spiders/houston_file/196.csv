JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I tried Jinya a few months ago when a craving for ramen began stirring, and I didn't know how to satisfy it.  I had been scrolling through the Phaedra Cook Houston Press 100 Favorite Dishes of 2015 just a few days earlier, and remember seeing the tonkotsu black ramen with thick noodles featured.  That was it.  I had to have it.
