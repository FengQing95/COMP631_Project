Local Foods////We just had Sunday brunch at Local Foods, land the food was great as always. Unfortunately, our meal was constantly interrupted, almost from the moment we sat down to eat, by staff wanting to take our meals and clear our space. The restaurant was only about a quarter full and no lunch rush in sight. Â Finally, instead of my husband finishing his soup, he just gave up and let them take his plate. Apparently, "when I leave, you can take my meal" doesn't mean the same thing to the restaurant staff as it does to us.
