Kata Robata////Service was utterly fantastic; major kudos to our server, Steven Lo (he gave me his business card after I asked for his name at the end of the night. So pro!). You can tell that he was excited about describing Kata's food, and he was just a great conversationalist - our meal definitely wouldn't have been the same without him. Unrelated, but Steven Lo had a trendy as haircut - where do you cut your hair, Steven Lo? Also, can I be your friend??
