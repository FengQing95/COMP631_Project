Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The salad had everything split up on the plate: mixed greens tossed in an oil vinegrette, half an avocado, and crawfish/shrimp tossed in remoulade sauce. It was great. The fried green tomatoes probably could've been bigger so we weren't just eating the breading, but otherwise it was good too. We also picked out a couple baked items and some coffee. I love the coffee here. A good amount of acidity that doesn't taste like an espresso.
