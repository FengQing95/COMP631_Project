Uchi////So I'm looking up what "Uchi" translates to and it's giving me "inside/interior [of a house]." ...okay sure, I can dig that - I mean, it totally fits the restaurant's vibe. But I think they're forgetting a couple things...like "divine"? "Badass"? "Orgasmic"? Or maybe something like, "a bit of heaven on Earth"? Ah, there it is. With its larger-than-life-in-a-tiny-bite plates and crazy-friendly service, Uchi gets a solid 5 stars from me...and then some!
