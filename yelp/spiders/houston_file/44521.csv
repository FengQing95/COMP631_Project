Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I heard that recently Common Bond has under-gone some new management so i don't know if that has anything to do with it. Or if it's because it had been a busy day...but this place is usually extremely busy when I go, and I've never experienced a coffee quite this horrific from them. Â
