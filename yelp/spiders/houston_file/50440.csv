Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Only reason why I give this place 4 stars is they get super packed on the weekends and the wait staff try to RUSH you once you've gotten your meal to make space for others. I can't blame them for having great food but I don't think it's cool that they try to push you out once you've been waiting for upwards of an hour!
