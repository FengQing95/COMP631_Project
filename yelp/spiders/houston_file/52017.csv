Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have to give it 5 stars for the food. We went for breakfast and it did not disappoint. The sweet potato bacon mash up is so delicious, with small pieces of bacon with a maple drizzle sprinkled over a soft, griddled sweet potato, all topped with a poached egg and avocado. The perfect balance of savory and sweet if you can't decide between the two for breakfast! Juan's breakfast tacos were also very tasty with the green chile hollandaise sauce, which wasn't overpowering. They were a sizeable portion for 3 tacos. The Corned Beef hash was another great plate, with tender, salty corned beef mixed in with hashbrowns and an egg of the side. This was a hearty dish, and the meat was very tender and moist. The chorizo is also really great as a protein option, it comes in patty form but is definitely packed with flavor.
