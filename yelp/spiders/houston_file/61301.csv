Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs, and enjoyed the overall flavor though it was a bit over peppered. The texture was strangely mushy like the spinach, artichokes, and eggs were pulsed through a blender a few times. The chicken apple sausage it came with was very yummy, potatoes were good but generic, toast was thick cut but came out on the same plate as the rest of my food, so there no clean plate room to spread my butter and jam on it. I ended up moving my toast onto my napkin, which our waiter saw and didn't offer me a small plate. Our waiter, Nathan, was very funny though and provided excellent service otherwise. The butter and cream are in the same small dish on the table, which is fine, but what is not fine is finding half used butter cups in the dish...they should really have an extra small bowl on the table for butter/cream/jam containers.
