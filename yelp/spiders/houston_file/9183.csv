JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I come here all the time. I've been here like a million times. I loveeeeee this place. Jinya is consistently amazing! The ramen is consistently milky and flavorful and everything nice. The waitresses are always really friendly and quick. Try to come here during the mornings on weekends because it's packed so much during the evenings. The evenings is a lottery game really, be prepared to wait but trust me, the food is well worth the wait!!
