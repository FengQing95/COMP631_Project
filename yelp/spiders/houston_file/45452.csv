Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Trying to decide on what to eat was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. I want to point out that the staff here is incredibly wonderful and so patient. I don't know how long I stood in line trying to decide on what to order, but the worker there completely understood my hesitance on making a rash and hasty decision and waited for me to be ready, and answered my many questions about the different baked goods they offered.
