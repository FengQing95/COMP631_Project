The Pit Room////The food was good , the brisket was moist and ready but the price at 14:02$ is 2 high for a 1 meat 2 side plate = it should be 1 meat 3 sides . im not saying more meat - no im not saying that - im saying for 14$ dollars on a week day lunch , show some more love on the sides by serving 1 meat 3 sides , the pit room has plenty room with your 14$ . The vaporized flammable hand sanitizer at the register should Not Â be there , thats a flammable that burns my eyes , 4 those unaware - hand sanitizer says on the back " Dont use this unless u cant find soap and water , highly flammable, keep away from eyes " " keep away from children" so yes somebody lathered down with it and got me . The city has a course on chemicals , im certain pit room knows the hand sanitizer flammable doesnt belong there . lastly the bill was 14:02$ i gave 3 five dollar bills , i received 3: 98$ back which on credit card its 14:02$ but on a cash buy its supposed to be 14$ even because of 2 reasons A) no 1.5% credit card fee and B) it takes about 30 seconds additional labor cost to pull out 98 cents from the register so thats 2 cents times twice per minute so that equals 4 cents per minute labor cost and 4 cent times 60 minutes equals 2:40$ ( 2 dollars and forty cents ) an hour ,its just a losing proposition for the pit room to be breaking a whole dollar for 2 pennies - it cost them more labor to do it - it holds the line up and it flys in the face of logic - going forward it needs to be anything cash off by 2 cents is rounded to the whole dollar and save everyone .i think that covers it - will i be back - yes but not for awhile because of the portion size of the sides in total * the meat was good portion-no complaint on the meat size just the 3rd side thats not there* to the 14$ ratio. Remember there is no lunch price and diner price its the same 14:02$ no matter the platter . This is a fantastic place to eat if your on a date and your not paying even better if the company is paying but for pit room to think your going to become a weekly regular at 14$ 1 meat 2 sides , perhaps some but must No. There were no other chemical smells after the hand sanitizer hit - that was good - yall know i cant stand chemical smell around my food , i gave the 4 star because the food was good just not enough for 14$ . call me with any more questions 832-258-7511
