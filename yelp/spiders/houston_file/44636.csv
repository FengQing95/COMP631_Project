Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Not a whole lot to add to this yelp page considering the number of reviews and the high rating. All of the bakery goods are pretty amazing, but my favorite by far is the kougin aman. It's flaky like a croissant with a caramelized glaze on it too. I haven't actually ran into a line here, but I hear it can be pretty long sometimes. Studying/working here isn't the best idea, but hanging out with people here is nice! Parking is also pretty spacious, but if the lot is full you can probably find street parking nearby.
