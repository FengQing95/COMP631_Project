Kata Robata////The first time I went to Kata Robata was for lunch several weeks ago. I had an extremely flavorful bowl of miso soup to start. My entree was fried tofu topped with bonito flakes which was bizarre given that: A) they used soft tofu chunks (rather than firm) which gave the tofu a texture similar to a jellyfish squeezeball, and B) the bonito flakes moved around as if they were alive (maybe they were- I don't know). I got out of there for $12 and the California Minimalist decor was cool and the service efficient so I made a note to return.
