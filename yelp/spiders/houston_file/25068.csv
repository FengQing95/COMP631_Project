Uchi////Some of my favorites were the salmon belly, yellow tail everything, and really just ask the chefs for recommendations. They won't let you down as everything tasted like a new experience. The thing I DIE FOR is the foie gras. GOOD. GOD. It was a culinary orgasmic experience. I've never tasted anything so sweet, juicy, succulent, savory, that offered this beautifully light crisp on the outside while maintaining a buttery-melt-in-your-mouth finish. It is unreal. You could have it for dessert honestly. The ACTUAL dessert of fried milk is really good. It's condensed milk fried in a doughnut like casing served with ice cream. It's a dream. The grand total for 4 of us was about $80 a person after tax and tip. It'll cost you a pretty penny, but it's worth it.
