JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty good place for ramen. We came on a Sunday evening and it was still pretty packed. We had to wait 10-15 mins before getting a table. The interior is nice and cozy and I liked the huge communal table in the middle. We got the salmon bun (pretty good) and the spicy chicken ramen. The ramen wasn't that spicy but luckily the table side chilly sauce did the trick. The broth was flavorful and the meat was tender and juicy. One bowl was enough for me and my wife. The service was pretty good and they have a free parking garage right next door. It looks like a nice date place or a cool spot to get some ramen with some friends.
