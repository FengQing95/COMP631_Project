Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Food: COME HUNGRY. I ordered the Benny Duo (Ham Benedict III, Chilaquiles Benedict, hash browns). This can easily be shared with 2 people...but I'm selfish and have a bottomless pit. Probably enough calories for the week, but super delicious overall. They have this green hot sauce from Austin I love, so if you like the citrus-spicy flavor, then check this sauce out.
