Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came intrigued by Bosscat's self-gratified rather large whiskey collection. The on-menu stuff is a good list, not spectacular, but nothing to turn our noses at. As I'm no longer a Texas resident, I jumped at the nostalgia of Balcones Blue, whereas my compatriots eyed the Japanese section. There's a thoroughly drool-worthy private whiskey section, which looks like an ideal place to throw a small group happy hour and erase the night away. There's also a rotation of solid craft brews, including some of Houston's finest, available. We didn't dine, but the menu, well, elevated Chili's.
