Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was excellent! There was a 30 minute wait on a Friday morning, but it was worth it. I ordered the OMG French toast with a side of hash browns (loved them) and my babe ordered The Snooze Classic with a regular buttermilk pancake. Everything tasted amazing. Our waitress brought us a complimentary sweet potato pancake which was also very delicious, but definitely on the sweet side!! We will surely be back again, there's so much more I'd like to try from the menu!
