Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////1 star for the line!  Sucks that there's a line to just get pastries.  It was out the door!  Even on a day when it was 38 degrees F outside! I waited in line for 20 minutes to get pastries and the guy behind me waited just as long just to get two loaves of bread. Additionally, it was raining that day, so no one sat outside and everyone was clamoring for a place to sit.  Different parties were sharing tables, but hey, it is "Common Bond" Bakery after all, right?  I don't really care if I have to share tables with someone, but it just attests to how busy and crowded this place is.
