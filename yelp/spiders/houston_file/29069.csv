The Pit Room////My friend who lived in Houston recommend this place and we had dinner here. Arrived around 6pm and there was already a line waiting, and when we left the line even stretched outside the restaurant. Crazy! We shared the three meat, which included brisket, pork rib and jalape√±o pork sausage. All of the meat were amazing! They did them right. There also came with two free sides, and we tried Mac n cheese and potato chips. Liked the creamy texture of the cheese. There was kinda of a bar with lots of drinks and we chose jarito, lime and mandarin flavors, both of which were great. Relaxing vibes and nice inner decorations. Really cool place to enjoy some authentic Texas BBQ!
