Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This was not a good visit.  They have 4 main courses and they run out of one.  3 people in the party order it.  Server was arrogant and unprofessional.  Manager did her best to make it right but the lack of professionalism from the server along with the running out of food far outweighed the response.
