Uchi////We went on a Tuesday, and arrived at 7:00 p.m. on the dot - NO WAIT. The start of a wonderful evening and a sign of many good things to come. Our waitress was delightful, and provided incredible customer-service. The view really is nicer from the top! As a pescaterian, the menu had a lot to offer my dietary preferences. Husband, on the other hand, who prefers cooked fish and beef had fewer options. All that being said, we didn't have too much trouble choosing several items. It's hard to remember everything we tried, and there are plenty of reviews on Yelp with delicious details, but I can't stop dreaming about one of the simplest items on the menu - the sake toro. That salmon belly was unlike any other piece of salmon I've had the pleasure of trying - buttery, complex and bursting with flavor without overwhelming. I think I could order myself 5 of them and nothing else and feel like I'd gotten my money's worth at Uchi.
