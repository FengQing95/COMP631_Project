The Pit Room////Went here with my cousin as he loves trying new bbq - not a disappointment. Good smoky flavor on their meats. The brisket is tender and juicy. The jalapeno sausage had just the right flavor and slight burn. Loved the sauces. And the sides were ok - loved the mac and cheese. But the BEST part was DEFINITELY the beef rib - only available occasionally and while a little pricey, worth the little extra as a treat. Look forward to my trip there.
