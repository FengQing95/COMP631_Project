Uchi////I really love this place...wish they had one in LA. It's not cheap exactly but cheaper and much better than some of the really 'fancy' sushi places (ones that come to mind - matsuhisa, katsuya to name a couple). favorite thing is to come for happy hour, get a couple things off there, then get some sushi off the normal menu (sushi is basically the only thing I get there). My favorite is the uni, but all the sushi is really good. Their big thing is taking traditinoal sushi and adding a subtle twist/flavor, which is what makes it really unique. Highly recommended!
