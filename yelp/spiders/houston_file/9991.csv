JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was so different than any other desserts I've ever had. It had the texture of egg pudding/flan and tasted like almond jello, but it was TOFU..crazy I know! However, that didn't stop me from eating it. It was chill, light, airy and just sweet enough to balance out the warm salty flavor from the ramen earlier that night. Topped with bits of fruits and a dab of whipped cream! Yum!
