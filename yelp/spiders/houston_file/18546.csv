Uchi////This place is worth all the hype. Be prepared to wait for a table but just know that it'll be worth it. The bar staff is very knowledgeable about the menu, warm and friendly. The machi cure was a symphony of flavors, the walu walu is as good as everyone says, and you absolutely must try the fried milk. I despise brussels sprouts and even I have to admit that Uchi's are delicious. Great place for a special date!
