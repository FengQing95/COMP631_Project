Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here with my baby girl and a friend & her baby. I received some rude customer service. Since I had to wait in line and there was no room to push a stroller, I decided to carry my baby into the restaurant and use a high chair once I received my food. So, I had my baby in one arm and my big diaper bag & wallet in the other. After I ordered my pastry I kindly asked the worker if she could help bring the food to my table bc I didn't have an extra hand at the moment. She responded with a rude look and seemed reluctant to help me. When I paid for the food, I gave a generous tip for them to bring the plate to my table. She handed me off to another young worker and asked him to bring the plate to my table, and he looked at me like I had 3 eyes! He was very rude and did NOT seem happy to help me! The fact that they demonized me for asking for help made me feel super uncomfortable and completely ruined my lunch. The customer service is very bad and the workers I encountered were very rude. Not going back to this place again.
