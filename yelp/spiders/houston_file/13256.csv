JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My friend and I ordered sprouting up ramen and spicy chicken ramen. The spicy chicken one was standard, pretty much what you'll get at a ramen place. But the sprouting up ramen was amazing. The broth is made of both beef and chicken so the soup has a distinct taste!! Please order the sprouting up ramen when you're here! So good!!!
