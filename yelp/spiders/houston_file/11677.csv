JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kate - Thanks for the great review! We're very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us, and even happier you tried ramen for the first time. When we thought to bring to Houston a restaurant dedicated almost entirely to authentic Japanese ramen, we weren't entirely sure how it would play. So it's always an encouraging to read reviews from folks who try us out and enjoy it -- thanks again!
