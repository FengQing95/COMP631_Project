Kata Robata////However, this last visit the quality of the cocktails and desserts was disappointing. The Shishito mojito seemed like mainly mixer, and did not come with the pepper garnish as usual. Also, we ordered the blueberry cake to go, and it did not come with the earl grey ice cream. When I ordered the cake at the table, the server even asked whether I wanted ice to keep the ice cream cold. I asked why there was no ice cream and was told that the to go order does not include it??
