Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the cannoli pancakes and a breakfast taco a la carte. I really like the a la carte option because sometimes the pancakes are too sweet so it's nice that I can also get a savory option to balance it out. The breakfast taco has a really good mix of flavors and I love the hollandaise sauce. The cannoli pancakes had pomegranate on them which was an interesting addition. We also had the option to split our checks on our own using an online payment system that I thought was helpful.
