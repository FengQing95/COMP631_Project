JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been to Jinya twice and both times was served by a heavy accent blonde lady. Both times was such a hard time explaining to her how I was requesting my order. When order came the first time, she saw that me ramen with ground chicken, when I had asked for grilled chicken. I mentioned to her I had ordered grilled, she then proceeded to come bring me a side dish wish grilled chicken. The way she duke weed was as she quickly passed by sliding it across the table, no hello, no "here's your chicken", just left it passing by, mind you this was a slow flow around 11 AM. Second time was a similar situation.
