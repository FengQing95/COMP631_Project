Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Dropped by for a midday snack and coffee and was greeted by a line out the door, which only got longer as I waited. The place itself is really nice, and the counter lined with rows of beautiful pastries and desserts is definitely impressive. After about a 15 minute wait, we ordered a few pastries (kugelhopf, chocolate chip walnut cookie, and chocolate croissant) and a cold brew iced coffee. I was generally unimpressed with the pastries (kind of a bummer because I love baked goods), especially considering the prices. The chocolate croissant was easily the best of the bunch, flaky and buttery, but it could've used a bit more chocolate. The other two items were pretty average and seemed a little stale and dry. I would consider coming back to give some of their menu items and desserts a try, just to see what all the hype is about.
