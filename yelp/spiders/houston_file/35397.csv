Local Foods////I usually go to the LF on san felipe and haven't been to this location in almost 2 years but read that this location got a new chef or new menu items so my boyfriend and i decided we had to try it since it's one of our favourite places to eat and let me tell you YOU MUST GO! Their new menu items are amazing and creative! The food was so delicious. The employees were also super nice and (i believe it was the manager) gave us some cookies to take home! Definitely will make the drive to come to this location from now one!
