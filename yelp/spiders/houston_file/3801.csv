JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is decent. It is much closer to my house than other options and it's fairly convenient to get to - although the parking garage can be a nightmare during peak hours at the nearby gym. Had the tonokatsu (sp?) ramen at maximum spiciness and it was legit. Not overwhelmingly spicy and maintained a nice rich broth flavor. I added an egg which I'd suggest to anyone ordering a bowl without one included. Tempura truffle brussel sprouts were aite, nothing to write home about. Fried chicken appetizer was pretty good but nothing exceptional either.
