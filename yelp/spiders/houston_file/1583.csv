JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They were removing stuff off the table while we were still eating. One server tried to take my wife's bowl away even after she told him she was not finished. She literally had to put her hand on it to keep it. Then the check came while were still eating and waiting to finish; we still wanted to order ice cream.
