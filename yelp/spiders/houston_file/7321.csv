JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time here and yes it lives up to the rumours!!  I ordered the premium tonkostu with a side of extra egg.  For appetizers, we ordered the takoyaki and it was delicious!  The softness of the outside melted revealing the chewiness of the octopus. The tonkostu itself wasn't  too spicy,  just right with the salt balance and portion size is perfect.  The meat was very soft.  Soft enough for you to taste the juice enveloping the meat.  The eggs were delicious as well softly complimenting the soup.  Totally recommend to come here and eat!!  Bon apetite!! Good thing we stopped here before our flight home~
