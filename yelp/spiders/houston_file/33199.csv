Local Foods////From the creators of Benjy's comes another Farm to Table concept. Local offers good food at reasonable prices in a counter-service format. The food is quick and consistently good. They have daily rotating specials which are always quit good. Soups are seasonal and rotate frequently. All sandwiches can be turned in to salads and sandwiches come with choice of 2 sides (all of which are quite good).
