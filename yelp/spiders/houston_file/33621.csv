Local Foods////Unique menu items with plenty of variety. Great ambiance. I would consider this a fast casual restaurant that is a cut above places like Cafe Express. They try to source everything locally and I believe their menu changes seasonally. I had the egg salad sandwich with a cup of chicken lemon grass soup and both were outstanding. Food came out quickly and staff is friendly. If you are doing lunch, get here early because parking is limited.
