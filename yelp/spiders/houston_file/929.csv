JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA never fails me and I am always extremely satisfied with my food and service.  From the greeting as I walk in the door to the full belly of yummy noodles and broth, they know how to keep a customer happy.  Brussel sprouts tempura makes a believer out of even sprout hating eaters and the rich broth keeps me coming back again and again.  I've been coming since they opened last fall and I have never had a bad experience.
