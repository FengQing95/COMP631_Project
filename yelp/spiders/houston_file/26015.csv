The Pit Room////Solid barbecue and fantastic customer service. Would pass on the venison sausage next time (wanted beef, but it was sold out) - flavor was good but it was kinda dry and kind of crumbled apart. The brisket was on point. The mac n cheese was ridiculously good. The charro beans and slaw were both okay. Looking around I wished we'd had the mustard potato salad. Will definitely be back.
