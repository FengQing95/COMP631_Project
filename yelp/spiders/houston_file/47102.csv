Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Guys. Go here. It is the best thing you can do for yourself. I came on a Tuesday around 12:30 with a party of 6 and there was no wait. My friend and I split a benny duo and pancake flight, sooo good! The benedict I picked was the one with salmon and it was so rich and delicious. But I really don't think you can go wrong as all my friends got different things and loved it. We were all so stuffed, it's a great deal. Seriously, bring yourself here on a weekday to avoid the lines and enjoy this awesome place!
