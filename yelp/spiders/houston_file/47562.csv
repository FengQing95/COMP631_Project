Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm really perplexed by the popularity of this restaurant as it always seems to be busy no matter when I try (key word try) to visit, parking is scarce and the small lot they have is cramped and not user friendly. I finally made it and was unimpressed. The server was friendly and fairly quick, he did a  good job being present without being obtrusive. They have an interesting menu at  an affordable price. I tried the Continental and my friends hash browns, overall good to middling but there were some weird and overly intense flavors that stuck out and seemed out of place. The experience was okay but not worth a second visit due to the abundance of impressive brunch options elsewhere.
