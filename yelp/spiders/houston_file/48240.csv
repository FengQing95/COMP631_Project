Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait was 30 minutes but worth it depending on what you get. I got the "Benny Duo" which is where you pick two different kinds of Eggs Benedict and they give you one of each. I got the Chilaquiles one which had corn tortilla base with cheese, Barbacoa, and a poached egg with hollandaise sauce. The other one was the "Bella Bella Benny" which has prosciutto, yummy cheese, and a poached egg with hollandaise sauce and a balsamic glaze. Super good!
