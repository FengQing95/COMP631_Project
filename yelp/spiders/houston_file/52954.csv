Kata Robata////Food is great.   Sushi rolls are a little smaller than what we're used to,  but I'm not particularly concerned about portion or price when going out to eat sushi. Server was very knowledgeable of the menu.   I was asking if a special was an appetizer or an entree  and he proceeded to tell me exactly how it's made... with details.
