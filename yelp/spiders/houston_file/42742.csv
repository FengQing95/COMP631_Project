Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As I always enter into a new place, I do so with great excitement and a tinge of nervousness.  I just really want to enjoy all new experiences.  It was this past Sunday and yes, the line was long; however, it moved quickly but only to arrive at a counter that contained a menu that have several items crossed out and "sold out" written next to them.  The case still held a few almond croissants, though.  That was all I needed, but the arrival of the fresh cookies created an addition to my order.  Service was plentiful but not very attentive at all.  At first, I just thought it was me, but my section of the line, that contained other virgins, also noticed.
