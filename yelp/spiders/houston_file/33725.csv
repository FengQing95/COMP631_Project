Local Foods////The food presentation and the atmosphere is 4.5 stars, but my tuna fish sandwich and the tomato basil soup were really really salty. Still edible, but off-putting. I couldn't remember why I don't go to Local Foods more often when soup and sandwich is my jam, and then I eat here and it all comes back to me. The flavors just don't match up to how nice the food looks.
