The Pit Room////Best BBQ "in the loop" and they also have the tastiest sides. Great atmosphere, always playing older honkytonk music for an authentic Texas experience. I love coming here because they cater to my food allergies without hesitation. I tell them I'm allergic to pork and they grab a new cutting board, knife, etc. to cut my brisket. That means a lot to me because I hate being "that customer" but I do have a lot of food allergies that make it a pain to go out to eat. They never let me down. Try their beef ribs, they are fall off the bone to DIE FOR!
