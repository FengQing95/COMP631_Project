Kata Robata////For entrees, I tried the duck dumpling ramen and foie gras & duck cold soba (buckwheat noodles). Duck dumplings were pretty tasty; the duck was almost melting out of the dumpling skins. Ramen noodles and broth were okay. They were just a little better than instant ramen. Yeah, that's right, I went there. Sue me.
