Uchi////This is sad. I used to be a big fan of Uchi too. I went here a good 4/5 years ago and was so wowed with everything. I tried a lot of things too! My friend and I tried at least 15 dishes and I loved every single one of them. This time I came in, May 2019, I was so disappointed. I still ordered a good 15-20 dishes/sushi but nothing WOWed me . The only thing that was good to me was the hot rock waggu beef... but idk how you can mess that up. Â
