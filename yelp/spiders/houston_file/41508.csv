Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came in midday and it was moderately busy. Service was good but not mindblowing. I got two pastries and some kind of mocha coffee. Sadly both the pastried were just ok and a bit dry. My coffee was pretty good, it wasn't overly sweet and the coffee has a pretty interesting and intense aroma. One thing I will say is that this cafe has great ambiance, the windows are huge and let alot of light which is great, even though this place gets crowded the space is arranged nicely so you never feel like you are in anybody's way.
