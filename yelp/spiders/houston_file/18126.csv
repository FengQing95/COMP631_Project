Uchi////Food was outstanding.  Brussels sprouts, flounder (hirame), salmon sashimi, bacon tataki, and some random maki roll we got were all terrific.  The chicken we ordered was good by chicken standards, but I wouldn't order it again.  And BTW - the salmon sashimi was on the house, not sure why we got it for free but we really enjoyed it!
