JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Pretty good ramen! Ramen isn't really Houston's forte, and a lot of the restaurants in Houston that specialize in ramen aren't very good, but I think jinya is adequate in satisfying any ramen cravings! I know a lot of people like to compare jinya to tiger den, but I think jinya is far superior. The service and ambience also kick it up a notch, in comparison to tiger den.
