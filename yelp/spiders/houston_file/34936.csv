Local Foods////I can't quite put my finger on it and I don't know if it had to do with the brussels sprouts being extremely burnt and that threw off my taste buds. I went back to let the cashier know it tasted very differently from what I was used to and luckily they were able to remake it for me. This time they had put the brussel sprouts on the side, added pickled onions which I didn't get the first time and left out my chicken.
