Baby Barnaby's////Beware anyone with Celiac Disease: This restaurant is not safe for you. I quizzed them about their Green Eggs and was assured it was gluten free. I only had the green eggs and fruit and became very ill. They were delicious but don't take a chance. If you do go there with family/friends just enjoy their great coffee. It's amazing.
