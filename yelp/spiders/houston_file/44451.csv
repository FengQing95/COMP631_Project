Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place was awesome. Had a large selection of sweets, soups, and even had a selection of wines. The pastries were delicious! My friend ordered the strawberry cheesecake mousse thing. Spencer treated us out of towners just splendid when he came to the table to offer goodies for the road. Outstanding customer service.
