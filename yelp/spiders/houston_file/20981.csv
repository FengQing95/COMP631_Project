Uchi////Today I actually had a far from great experience at Uchi. Their food didn't taste as good as I remember. The Brussels sprouts were very overly saturated with seasoning almost to where they were difficult to eat and it took 1 hr and 15 minutes for me to get my order of ham and egg rolls...1 hr and 15 minutes! Got a straight silly excuse ("it takes longer"...an hr and 15 minutes?!!!). I added a star back (they would have gotten one) because the manager was apologetic and gave us free dessert. Wish she could have given me back my time instead. Not sure if I will be back. Definitely will not be raving as much about this place to others...I'd feel terrible if they had a similar experience.
