Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I didn't see anything too fabulous jump out at me on the menu, as far as larger dishes, so I just went with the bosscat burger.  For $15 , it was good, but not nearly worth the money, especially since it doesn't come with fries or any sides.  My dining companion ordered the pork belly poutine, which was delicious as well.  Although there is not all that much pork belly in the dish....mostly the hearty gravy and cheese curds, it's still a delicious take on poutine.
