Uchi////Everything food wise was absolutely phenomenal! Honestly some of the best food I've ever had. My ONLY complaint was our waiter Anthony. I went there to celebrate my birthday and everyone from the hostess and the person who seated us wished me a happy birthday. However, our waiter was sub par, seemed to be in a rush, and wasn't really attentive. He ended up bringing out the check out before we even received all of our food and never even acknowledged my birthday. After we received the check we reminded our waiter that we were still waiting on more food. He acted like he didn't know and that the sushi bar was backed up but in reality he forgot to put in the order because we were charged separately for it later. My husband had to remind him of the occasion and then someone brought us dessert otherwise it definitely would never have happened. Overall, I rate the food 5 stars (freaking delicious) and service with Anthony 3 stars.
