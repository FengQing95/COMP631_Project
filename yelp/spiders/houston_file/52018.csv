Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////For the service, I might be inclined to give it 3-4 stars. This is a very busy, popular spot but it took a while for the server to come over and take our order. Then after we ordered, it took a bit for the food to come. Everyone was very kind, but it was just a little slow so by the time our food came we were pretty hungry. But other than that, the staff is full of smiling faces and I would say that the food was worth the wait.
