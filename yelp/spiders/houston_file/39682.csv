Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We arrived around 2PM on Saturday, and to our surprise, it was packed from the front to the back of the house. You can expect people of all ages in this place because we sat next to a family of two babies AND a table full of 55+ ladies enjoying themselves for brunch, which was really awesome to see!
