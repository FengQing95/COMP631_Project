Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best chocolate chip cookie in all of Houston! The texture is oooey gooey perfection and the walnut pieces make them irresistible! The pistachio and almond croissants are also super flaky and just the right amount of buttery-sweet. They have a parking lot so if it's not rush hour, parking is a breeze!
