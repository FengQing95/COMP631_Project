Local Foods////This is a Gourmet sandwich shop because you can definitely taste the quality of the food! Super sleek restaurant that dishes out super fresh foods and sides that you normally don't see at other sandwich shops. I agree with everyone else, the over-stuffed crusted chicken sandwich rocks, especially served with a side of their quinoa, orzo or kale salad. The only other sandwich I have tried is their gulf shrimp and blue crab and it was also, of course, very tasty. Yes, it will be pricier than what you are normally used to paying but remember, it's the quality that counts. Love the vibe of the place too, very simple yet refined.
