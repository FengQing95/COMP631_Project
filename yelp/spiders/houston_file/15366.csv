JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya gets an extra star for being vegan/vegetarian friendly; usually there isn't such an option for them at a ramen shop. It also wins in location/ease of parking. Close to downtown and has a dedicated parking garage. Their seasonal offerings are usually my favorite and is what I would recommend, like the kaarage ramen, which is indeed excellent. Simple toppings but excellent fried chicken and good broth flavor without being too heavy. I find the normal menu tonkotsu broth to be too heavy without the depth of flavor that other places like Tatsuya have. Also they are inconsistent with the quality of the ajitama egg. You can skip the poke tacos too; you'll find fresher poke elsewhere. Even though I give this place only 3 stars, I'll be back for sure.
