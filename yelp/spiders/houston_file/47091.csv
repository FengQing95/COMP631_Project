Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went here on a Friday, and luckily avoided the wait by being willing to eat outside (it was about 60 degrees, so it was a pleasant day). We were impressed by everything we ordered. I got vegetarian eggs Benedict (have never found a vegetarian version of this! So I'm excited to order it!) and a chocolate pancake, which was heavenly. I also appreciated that they let you drink some coffee for free while you wait for a table, which would definitely make the wait easier. Nearly everyone there was a millennial, but I am too, so I can't complain :)
