Uchi////If you like eggplants, you will love this. Absolutely my all time favorite. Seems so simple but it just melts in your mouth. Eat it as soon as it gets to your table. And don't forget it pick it up with your fingers and turn it over so the tongue will explore all of the flavor from the eggplants first rather than the rice.
