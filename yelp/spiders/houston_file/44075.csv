Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It is easy to see why Common Bond changed its hours to include evening as well--a change I'm glad happened. Every item, and I mean literally EVERY item, sold inside this unassuming bakery vies to be sold and consumed. The bread assault you with their wonderful aroma while the sweets entice you with their fantastic presentation. The menu, which changes every few months, is always incredible to explore as it features slight variations on time-tested dishes. One particular savory dish, the chicken torta, deserves particular mention, as it is among one of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted. Furthermore, the coffee comes in new varieties, like lavender latte, or simple pour-overs from high-quality beans (which can also be purchased there). There is simply no weakness in the menu anywhere!
