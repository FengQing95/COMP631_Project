Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came the first time around 12:30 pm on a weekday, with no wait. I ordered the huevos rancheros, and my mom ordered the pancake flight with the banana pancake special of the day. I had some bites of each and WOW Snooze knows how to do pancakes. Best pancakes I've had in Houston.
