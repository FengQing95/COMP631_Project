Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We were not greeted by happy smiles with the Bar Tender.  Okay.  Everybody has bad days.  But she didn't even ask us had we ever been there before or what she recommended.   This is my first time at Bosscat.  I had a hard time seeing anything I was in the mood for on the menu so I decided on the Bosscat Burger and Steak Fries.  My friend ordered the salad with Shrimp.
