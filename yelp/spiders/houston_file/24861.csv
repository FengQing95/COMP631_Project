Uchi////If you're looking for top quality food and service in Houston, Uchi is one of the most popular restaurants.  It opened up in 2012 and came from Austin, Texas.  It's quite pricey, but I would definitely recommend going at least once for the experience (even if you're a food snob and hate fusion food).
