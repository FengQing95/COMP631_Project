Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is by far my favorite brunch place to go to in Houston although the wait is usually around an hour since it's so popular. At my most recent visit, I got the Pancake Flight (Sunburst Cakes, Blueberry pancake, and White chocolate/chocolate pancake of the day) with a side of hashbrowns and my bf got the Shrimp and Grits.
