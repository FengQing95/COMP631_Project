Uchi////Dining with 9 other strangers was great!  We all had different takes on the food, but we all agree that everything was absolutely fantastic.  7 courses of awesome.  I only wish that dessert was on the regular menu.  I suggest that anyone try this experience:  7 courses not on the regular menu, free drink if you arrive early, free valet parking, a less expensive way to experience this restaurant, and a great staff!
