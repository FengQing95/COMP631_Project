Uchi////We next had the fried Brussels sprouts, which were dressed with a fish caramel--this dish reminded me quite a bit of the flavors of an Asian fish fragrance sauce and was very tasty, though it probably would have been better if served with some rice to soak up more of the sauce and allow the flavors to last longer. The venison (from the seasonal menu) was cooked rare and served with persimmon, pickled onion, and delicata squash, and the flavor of the venison was so gamey and distinctive. Next, we had the "buta pea," Berkshire pork ribs (from the happy hour menu), which were sous vide then braised and served with peanuts and thai herbs. Though some of the pieces of ribs were a little on the fatty side, they were fall apart tender and very nicely and uniquely spiced (reminiscent of Chinese five spice).
