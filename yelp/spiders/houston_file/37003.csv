Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went there with high expectations and i left so disappointed. I went there with my husband for lunch on a Saturday morning. I had checked the website beforehand and since my husband (unlike me) is not a brunch fan and we were happy to see that there was an all-day menu available. When we arrived we asked for both menus. After waiting for 5' minutes with brunch menus only, we asked for the all-day menu again. The same waitress that led us to the table informed us this time that the "ALL DAY" menu is available only for dinner on weekends. I really regret that we didn't leave immediately at that point. My husband struggled to pick something from the brunch menu. Eventually he ordered the fried chicken steak, only to find that the title was totally misleading. The "steak" proved to be minced meat (chicken meat presumably?) mixed with god knows what. I ordered the pancakes which I tasted good but gave me a terrible stomachache right after we left. Â sorry never again.
