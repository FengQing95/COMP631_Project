Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great brunch spot! atmosphere is loud but they play good music! Lol. Food was great, service was quick - a bit too quick. We felt a bit rushed at the end of our meal, as our plates were picked up before we were really done.. nonetheless, their menu is unique, love the wide variety of food. The mimosas were refreshing ! Highly recommend to those looking for a fun spot with friends
