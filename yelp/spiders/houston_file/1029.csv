JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen were excellent, better than all the other places in Houston, better than Tiger Den. The service was great as well. This place would have got 5 stars if they didn't insist the orange juice my 5 year old got did not contain alcohol. My daughter had one taste and said it tasted funny, I tasted and could taste the alcohol, we ended up getting her an apple juice and my husband finished her orange juice (in a big to go cup), and was tipsy on the way home. The waiter insisted that's just how their orange juice taste when we informed him. I think we got a Bellini instead, and it would have been fine if they just fessed up to it and replaced it with regular orange juice. Note to business, if there is no difference in taste between the regular orange juice you offer up to a 5 year old, and a Bellini, then you definitely have some quality control issues.
