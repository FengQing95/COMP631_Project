Local Foods////I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Their egg pretzel sandwich is to die for.... and their butterscotch brownie lawd have mercy lol. When I'm having a not so easy day at work I go here. One order is for 2 so you get plenty on the portion size at a nice price under 10.00 bucks not bad at all in the Rice Village area! They have messed up my order a few times that i ordered online which can be an inconvenience if your time schedule is tight. I've just learned how to check my bag before leaving.
