Kata Robata////It is not a big restaurant, and space is very limited, but once you are seated you are immediately immersed in the hustle and bustle of service, and they are quick to greet you.  The servers are not overly friendly, but will guide you on the menu if you are not familiar with some of the items.  They have specials that change frequently, so be sure to check that out, but below are some suggestions to try!
