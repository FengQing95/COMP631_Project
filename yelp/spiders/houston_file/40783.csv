Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat knocked it out of the park again. Tried the portobello fries, 12 hour rib and red velvet churros. All were amazing! I loved the portobello fries with the spicy jalape√±o dip. The 12 hour short rib was amazinggggg. So tender and went really well with the mashed potatoes. The churros were really good too, but I ate them after they had already gotten cold. I bet hot, they are the bomb! Also had the boss lady with the meal and it was refreshing and such a cute drink. Can't wait to come back and try more :)
