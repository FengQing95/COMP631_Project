JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Me and my girlfriend decided to try this place out since we couldn't find any good places open that served pho late at night. Walking in, I liked the ambience and was promptly seated to a table. I ordered a spicy miso tonkotsu, and my girlfriend ordered a spicy chicken ramen. After having a few bites before giving an opinion, me and my girlfriend both agree the ramen was really bland. There was no spice at all in either of our dishes, even when my girlfriend ordered her ramen "hot", which is the spiciest level they offered for that dish. Even after asking for extra chili paste to put in both of our bowls, the spice was still lacking, and I'm not one to eat the spiciest thing on a menu. I am giving this three stars though as the ramen seasoning sauce at the table kind of brought out flavor in the dish after I put in a liberal amount. Definitely disappointing.
