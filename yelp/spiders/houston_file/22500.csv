Uchi////Went here to celebrate a birthday and mentioned it when making reservations and again upon arrival. The atmosphere is nothing special and the service is attentive, although I didn't find our waiter pleasant and we were often helped by random waiters passing by (which seems to be the norm and is fine). He continuously tried to up-sell us every single time we ordered something. We took a few of his suggestions, but it got tiresome. When my boyfriend asked if they do anything for birthdays, he said, "Nope! We sing, that's it." Which clearly isn't true, and he could've at least been polite about it and said happy birthday. So, if I went again, I wouldn't want to be served by him, and I wouldn't go back for a special occasion.
