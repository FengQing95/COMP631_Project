Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You snooze, you lose should really be the name of the place.  Since coming to Houston I have yet to had weekend brunch at this awesome place.  I've managed to sneak in a couple weekday breakfasts though.  First time we were here, my mom and I made the mistake of ordering two savory dishes.  I had their Snooze Spuds Deluxe.  A heaping pile of hashbrowns, with your choice of two meats topped with scallions, cheese and two eggs cooked to your liking.  YUM!  I had ham and sausage the first time, which I loved.  Second time I came back and had Chorizo instead (I was not a fan).  The hash browns were cooked perfectly, not mushy, just enough crispiness and definitely enough for two meals.  My mom's favorite would have to be their pancake flight.  Three different flavors of fluffy pancake for breakfast?! Who wouldn't love that.  The Blueberry pancake was my favorite but she loved the Pineapple upside down pancake.  The sweet potato one was great but neither of us fell in love with it.  My husband's favorite (and 2 months later still raving about) are the Chilaquiles Benedict.  Snooze, you have won our take out only or weekday breakfast hearts.  Unless you come pretty early on the weekend or is willing to wait for a couple hours, definitely think bout doing the take out option.  They do have some games and coffee to keep you otherwise.  Since they don't use buzzers and you are texted when your table is ready you can take a stroll up in the neighborhood and then return.  The parking is very limited though, street parking is what I always end up doing, there are probably only a max of 15 spots in their lot.
