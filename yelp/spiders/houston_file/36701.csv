Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I ended up here with a friend on a late Saturday afternoon on a whim, and I was impresssed! We were seated immediately and had great service from start to finish. I tried the burger and added guac, and it was one of the best I've ever had! My friend had one of the salads, and she really enjoyed it as well. Definitely looking forward to going back! They had some fun looking cocktails I'd like to try next visit. The atmosphere was also very different than anywhere I've been. Cool vibes!
