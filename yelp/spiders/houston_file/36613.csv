Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Iâ€™m very sorry to hear that you did not enjoy the items you tried from our HRW offering. We are honored and privileged to participate in such an amazing cause and we really believe in this menu. Again I am very sorry that it was a miss for you, but I hope you will be willing to give us another chance. I would like to invite you back as my personal guest so that we can provide with a much better experience not just because I know we are capable of that, but because that is what you deserve. Please accept my offer of dinner for two on me and I will personally make your reservation for a day and time of your choosing. I hope to hear from you soon and would really like for you to try some of our core menu items.
