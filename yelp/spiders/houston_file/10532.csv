JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time I went here was my first time trying ramen. I had no idea what to get, especially as a vegetarian, so I got the spicy creamy vegan ramen - it was pretty bland, and I couldn't even finish half my bowl. Then I gave it a second chance, and this time I got the spicy chicken ramen without the chicken and replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth with a side of brussels sprouts. It was truly AMAZING and I actually finished the entire bowl!
