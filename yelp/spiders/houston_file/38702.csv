Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////All in all, a pretty good place, my only complain is it's a bit pricey...$12 for the shot, $8 for the sangria and $16 for the breakfast burger...They do, however, have a $32 special that includes an entree and unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, but you'd still have to get at least 2 or 3 drinks to get your money's worth. Would recommend overall though!
