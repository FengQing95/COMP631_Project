Baby Barnaby's////My boyfriend and I came for brunch one day and this was actually a second choice because Snooze had a 2 hour wait. I came here and was pleasantly surprised. I got the green eggs and it was amazing. The potatoes were really good and the eggs had a different yet really good flavor. I also had the French toast which was really good as well.
