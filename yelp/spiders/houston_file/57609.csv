Kata Robata////This place is amazing! We tried Kata Robata take out the other day since dining in is currently not an option due to COVID and we were satisfied! We ordered the Texas Kobe Feef Skewer for an appetizer and, oh my gosh, it just melts in your mouth. I wish I would've gotten two orders of it.
