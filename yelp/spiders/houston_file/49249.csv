Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////2.  Regardless of the way you're greeted by the people at the host station, they're supposed to seat you.  There were two employees at the entrance when I walked in.  One looked at me, said good morning, then went back to talking to the other.  Since the two customers in front of me had also just walked in without assistance, I figured that's what I was supposed to do.  In hindsight, this is probably what caused a lot of the service issues today.
