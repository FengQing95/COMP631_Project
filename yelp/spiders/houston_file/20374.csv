Uchi////When Uchi first opened, it was my favorite.  It was everything I wanted it to be.  Since then, the quality has slipped just slightly, but it's still on my list of faves.  The flavors mix together to excite the palate and the fish is top-notch.  I love doing the tasting menu.  If you don't know about the brussel sprouts, find out.
