Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Celebrated my birthday this evening with them. My date and I started with cocktails. Honesty some of the best cocktails I've ever had. I had the Bosscat, which is their take on a whiskey sour. USUALLY whiskey sours are too sour but this had the perfect combination between bitter and sweet! My girlfriend had the Kentucky Orange Blossom. It was the "best [expletive] drink that's she's ever had].
