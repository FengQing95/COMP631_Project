Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best bakery in Houston: creativity, variety, deliciousness...the perfect recipe. The lines get pretty long on the weekends so I'd suggest visiting on a weekday if you can. I've been several times and always try something never every time I come and I'm never disappointed.
