Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is one of my favorite spots for a night of good cocktails and food with good company. Hailing from LA, the restaurant has a cool casual, yet classy intimate vibe, and boasts their whiskey selection. My personal favorites from the menu are the Mac & Cheese (go Chef's French Onion), the Bosscat Burger (with egg, so delicious and filling!), and the Cornbread Madeleines (the combination with huckleberry butter is to die for). If parking right in front of the restaurant is full, there is always the garage located on the far right side of the parking lot/shopping center.
