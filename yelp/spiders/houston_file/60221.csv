Baby Barnaby's////Now for the food -- I ordered the Green Eggs (of course), which were complimented with breakfast potatoes, chicken apple sausage and toast (but I opted for a biscuit). The results? WOWWW. I am not exaggerating when I say that EVERY SINGLE BITE was more heavenly than the last. Everything on my plate was just so gosh darn tasty! The eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke & jack cheese make an outstanding combination. The potatoes were cooked to a perfectly crisp golden brown. Chicken apple sausage never fails to satisfy my taste buds and even the biscuit was buttery, fluffy, and gone with every crumb. Two thumbs way up. My friend ordered the blueberry pancake, scrambled eggs and bacon, but was more excited about my food than his plate.
