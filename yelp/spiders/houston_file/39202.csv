Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Friends and I went here recently for happy hour because I found it on yelp, it had great reviews, and I wanted to try it out. Â On arrival I realized I had actually already eaten at this restaurant before, so I guess that gives you some idea of how memorable it was for me. Both of my visits have been about the same, just fine/average. Decor is cool and trendy with a lot of concrete/ stone, and open ceiling, However this unfortunately makes for a really loud experience (nothing to dampen the noise!). The food itself is pretty good, some items better than others. Off the happy hour menu we got the the Pig Pickin' tacos, the Dr. Pepper wings, the gulf tuna wrap and the Bosscat grilled cheese (not pictured, tuna wrap). On the main menu we got the Pork belly poutine, the Mac and cheese and the spicy chicken and cheese dip. The grilled cheese and the Mac and cheese were definitely the stars of the show, the poutine was salty and just overall not that great. The rest of the food was solidly good, and our service was also spot on.
