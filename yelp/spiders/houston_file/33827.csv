Local Foods////My second time enjoying this scrumptious food and still, zero disappointment. Had the Garden Sammie as a salad, added chicken. Everything tasted incredible from the pickled onion to the curried cauliflower to the just-right amount of dressing on the bed of lettuce. My friend comes here every week and never tires of these incredible flavors - I can see why! These folks make your smart food choices taste absolutely delicious.
