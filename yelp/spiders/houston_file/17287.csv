Uchi////Great place.  Fun vibe, tasty and creative food, very knowledgable servers who work hard to give you a great experience.  The quality of the raw fish isn't on par with the best sushi places in some other cities (NYC/LA/Chicago/Dallas), but they make up for it with great combinations of flavors.  The cooked dishes are outstanding as well; our favorite was the walu walu.
