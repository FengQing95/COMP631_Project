Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Everything on the menu is delicious!! The service is amazing, they're very helpful with menu suggestions. I personally love the Chilaquiles Benedict. Coffee is great, but the "Mmm Mmm Mimosa" is perfection!! My favorite brunch spot, the food is definitely the wait, it's truly made with love!
