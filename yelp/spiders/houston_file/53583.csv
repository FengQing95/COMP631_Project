Kata Robata////This place fits into the more modern style sushi, with decor to match.  Also they have lots of natural lighting, a plus in my book.  For lunch they have many affordable options.  My gf and I opted for the daily sushi special to split, and both did a sushi combo.  I don't remember the contents of either one of the combos but do remember that there was a scallop piece that was just amazing!
