The Pit Room////Wow. The beef ribs and beef brisket were amazing. Both had a nice pepper bark. Meat was tender so really no need to use sauce. Love the bread a cross between a slice of Texas toast and sourdough. The charred green bean side was out of this world. Indoor seating was tight (chose to sit inside over very accommodating outdoor patio). I will be Â eating there before I leave town.
