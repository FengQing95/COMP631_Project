Local Foods////My bf had the crunchy chicken sandwich and I had the smoked salmon sandwich (cannot remember the name). I also ordered the cantaloupe mint mimosa which was soo refreshing. (Who cares if it's dinner time?) The food was good, service is amazing (they repeatedly checked in on us) and the atmosphere is chill. I'm definitely coming back.
