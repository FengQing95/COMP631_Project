JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We found this place once we realized tiger den was closed. The location is really nice and the ambiance is really cool. We ordered appetizers which they were just okay. The fried Brussels sprouts really need some type of sauce and the salmon sushinini(which wasn't bad) it was much better paired with the kimchi. But I ordered the JINYA tonkotsu black spicy with extra garlic, and spicy egg. The pork was melt in your mouth delicious and the broth was delicious. My husband ordered the spicy chicken. I tasted his it was good my mine was euphoric. We will definitely be back.
