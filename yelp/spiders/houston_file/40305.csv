Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our group had the pork chop, steak and catfish and all were delicious. Atmosphere is a tad loud but still able to hold a great conversation. Best of all was the fantastic service we received from Henry; not only could he explain every dish on the menu and make great recommendations he has a great knowledge of the whiskeys they have. Be sure to take the time to dine at Bosscat and ask for Henry!!
