Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Before heading back to Austin on Sunday, we stopped here for breakfast as we always tend to do. We got there early, so didn't have to deal with the line and ordered the Quiche Lorraine, Tamales Benedict, a pistachio croissant (natch), and a couple of baked goods to take home.
