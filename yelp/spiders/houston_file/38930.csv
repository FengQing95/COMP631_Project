Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had a great experience here. The Bosslady cocktail is delicious and looks beautiful too! We tried the chicken and cheese dip & the Brussel sprouts as appetizers (both gluten free) and they were so delicious! I got the Cajun Brick Chicken which was very flavorful- it has a nice spicy kick! My friend got the spicy crab pasta (also gluten free) and added grilled chicken and loved it- I tasted it and loved it too. My boyfriend got the steak dinner special (10 oz steak, green beans, & mac and cheese for 20$) and he cleaned the plate. Came out to  $170 for 3 entrees, 2 appetizers and 5 cocktails. The place has a cool vibe! We will be back. The only thing that was a bit annoying was my boyfriend asked for a steak sauce- they didn't have any but the server brought out their rib sauce instead. He never mentioned it would be an  extra charge.  We got the bill and saw a  $2 charge for the tiny thing of sauce he brought. He also added jalapeños to my dish because I said I liked spicy food, which I thought was nice until I saw he charged me extra for the jalapeños too even though I never asked for them.
