Local Foods////Not to big on vegan or healthier foods in general but Local Foods definitely changed my mind. They have a lot of vegetarian options but also a couple meat options as well. Food taste great and portion sizes are surprisingly pretty big. Tried the Crunchy Chicken Sandwich on Sourdough bread with a side of house chips. Definitely a place that caters to all while still maintaining their promise of fresh and healthy foods.
