JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Solid ramen here. I typically order vegetarian ramen, and Jinya has a good option: the vegetable soup ramen. It weirdly comes topped with a handful of salad greens, but once you eat your way through that (or I guess mix it in), you are left with a flavorful broth, well-cooked noodles, and good toppings. The Brussels sprouts appetizer is delicious!
