Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Omg this place is okay but the customer service is the worst. They delete posts on instagram also rather then just respond to general questions. I rarely leave reviews but this place lost all its charm and integrity the second they got new owners. The last three times I've gone have been for something they posted on instagram that I felt enticed to go get. And the last three times, I've left frustrated that they falsely advertised things they don't have. Most recently the mini king cakes. I went in the morning the day after posting so they have no excuse for why they said they weren't going to have mini king cakes today... Third time for me was a charm. Iearned my lesson and will definitely not be getting any more over priced cakes or pastries for them. And I will make sure to spread the word to all my coworkers and family.
