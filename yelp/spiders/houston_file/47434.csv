Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As a breakfast food lover, I definitely enjoyed eating here. The food was good both in quality and quantity. My friend got a breakfast burrito and it was the biggest breakfast burrito I have ever seen in my life. The server was very helpful and gave us just the right amount of attention. I will definitely come back for more.
