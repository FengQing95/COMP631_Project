Uchi////I felt like Tyson Cole really got it right with Uchi.  Great atmosphere, service, and food.  The only complaint is the wait, but heck what are you to do when a million people want to eat at your resturant?  Wait 2 hours of course!  Be smart and make a reservation...but that just means you'll have to plan 3 weeks in advance...or else just come at 1030pm.  We noticed it starts to get a little light in the dining room at that hour, haha.  Ok, go and check it out, and expect to have an excellent experience and actually have it!  Happy eating!
