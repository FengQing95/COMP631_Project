Local Foods////One word to describe Local Foods when I finished eating....HAPPINESS. I was incredibly satisfied leaving Local Foods, and the best part of it was that I convinced myself it was worth it to be stuffed silly to the core because all of it was LOCAL, FRESH, and HEALTHY! I went to Local Foods with 2 of my girlfriends, and we ended up sharing our 3 entrees to try it all.
