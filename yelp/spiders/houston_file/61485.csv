Baby Barnaby's////Let me start with the parking situation, I will say...it could be better but I understand. The parking lot is small, and if you can't make it happen, street parking is your other option. Get here early, it seems to stay busy (for good reason). The wait was reasonable the day we visited (maybe 20 minutes?), we signed in and then kept an ear out for our name. Service was very friendly and for the most part pretty attentive.
