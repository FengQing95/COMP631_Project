Baby Barnaby's////Unlike most of my kin who prefer to go elbows deep into something fried and bacon-ey after a night of drinking, I prefer starting my mornings off right. Luckily, Baby Barnaby's feeds both crowds. There, folks like myself can nosh on chicken apple sausage, egg whites, veggie sausage, cup o' fruit and sip on freshly squeezed juices ... And of course they have the necessary bacon, ham, t-bone, and pork chops to "meat" others' needs. Check out the menu:
