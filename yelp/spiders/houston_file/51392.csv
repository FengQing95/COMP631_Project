Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here twice - both to celebrate some good news each time with different company. The first time, I made the mistake of ordering the palomimosa and found it exceedingly tart and hard to drink - however, its alcoholic content was strong so I made it work. The second time around I tried the mmm mimosas and that hit the spot for a light, fruity, brunchy drink. After reading the tips, I learned about the cinnamon roll pancakes and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the pancakes when they were brought out - OMG!  I had enough on the plate to share with my three companions AND still be filled. During my second visit,​ I learned that you can order one single pancake so if you are dining alone and plan on eating more than just these pancakes then that will probably work better for you.
