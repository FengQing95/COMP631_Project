Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here with a group of friends and we also tried the pancake flight (5/5). We all wanted to try something sweet too but didn't want to commit to just 1 dish of sweetness, so we all split it. I definitely recommend this if you're coming here with a group of 3-4 people who want to split some pancakes. We got the pineapple upside down pancake, chocolate chip, and blueberry pancake. (We ordered this on top of our own separate dishes.)
