I normally hate typical breakfast sausage, but their chicken apple sausage is sweet and thus delish! The potatoes are shaped like small rectangular prisms, but they taste sort of like seasoned waffle fries... does that make sense? Wheat toast is wheat toast, but you get a whole assortment of packaged jams to spread, all of your choosing.
