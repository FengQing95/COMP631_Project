JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In regards to our prices, I can tell you that over the years I have visited dozens of ramen shops worldwide, and I've spent as little as $8 for a bowl of ramen and as much as $20. What I have learned is that each ramen shop is unique in its own way -- from the noodles and broth they use, to the side dishes they serve, to the price points they target.
