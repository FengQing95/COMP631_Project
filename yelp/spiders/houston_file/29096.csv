The Pit Room////My hubby and I are BBQ fanatics- we like to cook a lot of BBQ on our smoker at home. which makes us very picky on where we eat BBQ and how it's cooked. This place was amazing. So yummy. Everything on their menu was delicious. Â We bought over $80 worth of meat to take home too- so worth it.
