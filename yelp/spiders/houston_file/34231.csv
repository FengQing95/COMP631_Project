Local Foods////You get to pick 2 sides with each sandwich- I enjoy the kale salad, It has Parmesan cheese, olive oil, pine nuts, raisins and I think a splash of lemon. The flavors dance in your mouth, so good. The tabouli is good, made with cauliflower, mint, parsley. My boyfriend loves the soba noodles.
