The Pit Room////The food here is good, but the service can lack sometime. The staff can seem down in the dumps at times or seem to busy to give complete attention to you. I like everything for the most part. I love the brisket and the pork and I love that they give you bread too! Not always at BBQ places do you get bread. It is something small but makes a huge difference.
