Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Well based on the Yelp review, I visited this restaurant around 12:30pm today. Not a long line, but the wait was still about 1/2hr. No parking...had to part 2 blocks away. But, while waiting, seeing the happy employees with smiles on their faces made the wait seem shorter. As the for the food..we ordered pancakes, had to try the hash browns, bacon the eggs (which they prepared wrong but replaced also). Aside from the pancakes being cold (which they gladly replaced), the food tasted very good. The portions were too big, so I suggest sharing, which we did. I'm not a fan of waiting, no matter how good the food is, but I will visit this restaurant again after the morning rush; mostly due to the service, and the food is good. The decorum is quite appealing and relaxing, despite the crowds. I will try something new the next time. Is the area not Montrose anymore. I noticed references to it being in the Heights.
