Kata Robata////I was recommended Kata Robata by a good friend. I came here with my Fianc√© for lunch to celebrate our 6 yr anniversary. OH MY it was so delicious & tasty!!! I wish I took pics to share but I was too excited to just eat it. I recommend everything we ordered! Lobster Mac n' cheese, braised pork belly with poached egg & spinach, Tonkatsu Ramen and some sushi combo. Doesn't even matter what sushi because you can tell that the sushi is very fresh as it just melted in our mouth!! Everything was filled with flavor. We came during lunch but even that was very busy, I recommend booking a reservation!
