Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is a neat bakery/bistro in our area. If you go on the weekend, be prepared to wait. Sometimes the line is out of the door, sometimes it takes a while for a table to free up. They have some unique menu items. I do think that their macarons while delicious are a bit pricey. And sometimes the quality isn't all the way through. For instance this past weekend I got 6 macarons, 4 of the flavors were great and soft with just the right amount of crunch. But one of the flavors (which I got 2 of) were so hard I could hardly bite into them.
