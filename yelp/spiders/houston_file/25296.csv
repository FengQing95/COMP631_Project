Uchi////Love the daily happy hour here from 4-6pm which features select items from the regular menu for a few dollars off. My favorite dishes are the bluefin otoro, hama chili, pitchfork roll (such great flavors for a vegetarian item), and any wagyu offering. Service is always top notch, and sometimes complimentary items are given which is a nice gesture. Reservations are recommended during busier times, but I can usually snag a table for an early dinner on the weekend. This is the perfect place to satisfy any sushi craving!
