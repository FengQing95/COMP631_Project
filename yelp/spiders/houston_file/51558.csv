Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I felt like the pot pie filling was good, but there was not enough of the chicken or filling.  I was left with some dry puff pastry at the end of the meal.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly!  The service was rather mediocre, with the waitress taking a long time to get our check, and really, needed a mint.
