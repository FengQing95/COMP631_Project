Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very disappointed.  I am positive the chef is different. The entire experience was sub par compared to past experiences. So sad won't recommend nor will we return.  Kitchen needs help.  Over cooked yoke undercooked whites on croque madam.  French dip was basically mushrooms . French fries severed cold and never was approached by a wait person.
