JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Brian - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you feel our ramen is overpriced. We get compared to a lot of other ramen houses in Houston, but we prefer to look at the big picture: This wasn't the case just a few years ago. Today, Houstonians have CHOICE when it comes to ramen, which is not something you can say for a lot of the other major cities in our great nation.
