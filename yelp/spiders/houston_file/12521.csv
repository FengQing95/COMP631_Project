JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was craving some fried rice which Jinya unfortunately doesn't offer, however they had a pork rice bowl that ended up becoming a part of my Cha-Cha-Cha leftovers the next afternoon that I'd also recommend. Again, the pork was phenomenal and the rice served its purpose.
