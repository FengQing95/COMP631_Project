Uchi////Uchi was a place that I was initially worried about.  On the one hand, I love Japanese food, and the Austin location was spectacular.  On the other hand, I have complained for years on Yelp about the tendency--certainly nationwide, but definitely more pronounced here--to substitute fancy surroundings for top quality fish.  I was therefore concerned about the potential to have Uchi be overly hyped.  I was wrong.
