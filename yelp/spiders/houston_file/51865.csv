Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////WOW! One of the most amazing restaurant experiences we've ever had! Despite it being a holiday weekend, Snooze District Manager, Jason, was in the restaurant and personally taste testing in the kitchen. He found that the Sweet Potato Hash was not up to Snooze's very high standards (overly salty, he said), came to our table to warn us, to let us know that there was insufficient time to make more hash and to suggest that we find a substitute - which we did. The Corn Beef hash was excellent.
