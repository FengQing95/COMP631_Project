Uchi////Still my top place to dine in Houston for special occasions! The ambience here is cozy and the place is pretty charming. I've always found the staff to be top notch. They are absolutely great when it comes to service. The waiters have always been fun people who are helpful in recommendations, explaining each dish, and instructing customers on how to consume each dish. As for the food, EVERYTHING is tasty. Sashimi tastes fresh. The hot tastings are SO delicious. Appetizers are truly good. The best part? The chefs tend to throw in a few special dishes for us on the house! The desserts are also a must. If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion with a small group, this is the spot. Just make sure you always reserve about a week ahead of time or else you'll be waiting for a while at the door.
