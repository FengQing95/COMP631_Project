Uchi////We picked a refreshing Pinot Grigio and decided to trust our waiter to take us on a food journey (we had the option of picking alla carte, chefs pre fix or just trust our waiter). And boy, did he take us on a journey! It's been a few weeks since we actually went there so I probably won't recall all the plates but check out the pics. So, we started with the Hirame Usuzukuri which burst with freshness and bright citrusy acidity. Next came walu walu- the fish skin was so crisp, beautifully contrasting the moist fish. Yokai Berry came accompanied by, the most simple yet my absolute favorite of the night, oysters with a pinch of sea salt and olive oil. Suzuki and Hamachi were the first of our sushi pieces. We were advised to pick them with our bare hands and land them fish first on the tongue so that the warm rice smooshes the flavors in your mouth. Naturally no soy sauce! And OMG, I've been eating sushi all wrong my entire life! Next came the foie gras brûlée with mustard greens and toasted pistachio which was INSANE, a total mental orgasm! The Ikura was accompanied by quail eggs which was a combination I didn't expect to work so good! The fresh saltiness of the roe was complimented beautifully by the creaminess of the row egg. The sweetness of the flounder in the Hirame was escalated by some fresh mint and sea salt- yum! We finished the evening with sous vide prepared Kobe beef.
