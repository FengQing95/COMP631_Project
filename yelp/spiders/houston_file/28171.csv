The Pit Room////Now, to the main reason why I even came to The Pit Room. Which, by the way, would be a great name for a rock club! The barbecue... Great smoke and overall taste/seasoning on the all the meats. The problem? It seemed like I was eating day old barbecue. Everything was a bit dry. Zero grease on the serving paper. That's almost sacrilegious. The brisket was a tad too lean for my liking. Perhaps I should have asked for a marbled slice. As much as I love coffee, I didn't too much care for their coffee barbecue sauce. I do like their pickled onions and cucumbers.
