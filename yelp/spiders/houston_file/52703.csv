Kata Robata////We went to Kata Robata for Houston Restaurant Week, after a co-worker raved about the place. Dinner started out well, the agedashi tofu and pork belly salad were both excellent. For entrée, I ordered the Sushi & Roll Plate while my husband ordered the Grilled 72 hours TX Kobe Beef. I am not sure if the portions were reduced significantly because of HRW, but my husband's ENTRÉE consisted of 4-5 small (and I mean really small) cubes of beef and another 4-5 bite-sized pieces of potato. Seriously, for entrée? Really?? To add insult to injury, the Kobe beef itself did not live up to expectations in terms of tenderness or flavor.
