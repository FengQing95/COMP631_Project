Uchi////We enjoyed a number of hot and cold dishes, including the Jar Jar Duck, which may be the most stand-out item on the menu.  Everything was very unique.  Nothing can be categorized as sweet, savory, tangy, smoky, because I can assure you, there are complex and balanced layers to the flavor of each menu item.  The sashimi was of excellent quality.  God, this review reads so boring.  It was honestly just so good that I don't have a lot to compare it with, or a lot more to say.
