Kata Robata////I come to Kata frequently for dinner and for happy hour. I love the lychee martini. I also really like the appetizers. The agedashi tofu and tofu with mixed mushrooms is the bomb dot com. The moving flakes never fail to freak me out and add a thrill to my meal. Kata Ramen is not bad but avoid the calamari. My friends tell me the sushi is great but I am not the one to ask. I also like the miso soup, I've had the experience of too bland or too salty in other places but it's just right at Kata which makes miso happy :)
