Kata Robata////Excellent sushi. I cannot think of any other place that serves better (yes, I've been to Uchi, and no, I didn't like their sushi...a rep there suggested to me it got sent out incorrectly when I was there, and Kubo's is currently closed). Their specials and non-sushi dishes are almost always excellent (I had a roasted carrot and coconut foam special that was underwhelming and a bit confusing - a sweet foam with carrots? - but have otherwise have loved them). Best seaweed salad I've ever had, even though it's completely different from the standard seaweed salad typical of sushi places. The fact that their specials are *always* changing keeps things fresh (NPI).
