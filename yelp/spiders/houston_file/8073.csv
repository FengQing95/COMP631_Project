JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Juno - Thank you for the great review! I'm glad you were able to visit us during a less-congested time, though I will remind our servers that they need to better balance speed with efficiency. If you've ever worked in this industry, you'd know every day is an opportunity to learn from our mistakes and improve. Thank you again and we hope to serve you again soon.
