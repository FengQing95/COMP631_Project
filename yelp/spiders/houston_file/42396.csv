Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A bit pricey, $47 for 2 for breakfast. 2 lattes, 1 croissant and 2 entrees. Food and lattes were good, and the bakery items are to die for. I probably wouldn't order from the menu again, and just stick to the wonderful Chai latter and a few items from the bakery section.
