Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Before going there, I was excited that I might have finally found a good Benedict place in Houston. But it was not as amazing as what I was hoping. The combo option give you the opportunity to pick 2 different egg benedicts which I thought it's really cool and other places should do the same. We also got OMG french toast, i wish it was a bit less sweet. That's why they don't get 5 star from me.
