Baby Barnaby's////I have eaten here several times for lunch/dinner over the past year. I always try something new, because the menu is pretty diverse. They have Burritos and Burgers and several different entree options. They seem to be pretty open to some custom ordering as well. Service is always good, and the atmosphere is clean and casual.
