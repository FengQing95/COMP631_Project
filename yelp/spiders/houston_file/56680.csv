Kata Robata////Chirashi - What an amazing entree. Was a bit upset to find out that they replaced the fatty tuna with another cut of fish, but it was still overall a very great dish. All the fish (even the squid!) melts in your mouth when you bite into it, and their sushi rice is out of this world. Would definitely recommend this!
