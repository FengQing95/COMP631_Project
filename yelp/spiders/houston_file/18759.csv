Uchi////There's really nothing negative you can say about Uchi, except for the fact that it's difficult to get a table.  The place looks fantastic, including the bar, the sake menu is the best I've ever seen outside of Japan or California, and most importantly, the fish was, for lack of a better word, perfect.  This was the best sushi I have had since I left San Francisco, and is a must-visit location for sushi lovers here in Houston.
