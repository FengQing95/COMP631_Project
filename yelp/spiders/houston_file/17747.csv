Uchi////- Food - Amazing. We decided to go all out and order the ten-course tasting menu.  Highlights included shun no kaki (fresh oysters), hirame usuzukuri (flounder), yokai berry (salmon w/ crispy kale), and crispy brussels sprouts (SO good).  The second-to-last course was disappointing (momo to butaniku - pork) - it just seemed out of place and not very flavorful.  Everything else was delicious, and so fresh.
