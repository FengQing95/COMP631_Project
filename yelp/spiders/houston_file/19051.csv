Uchi////Well this year my gf, had a hectic schedule and was not going to be able to do anything on Valentine's so I opted for the first available time she could enjoy it, the day after.  It worked out well, because it was a bit less crowded.  We booked at 5 pm, and Uchi has their version of Happy Hour from 5-6:30.  It's by far the best Happy Hour in town for food.  Because they put many of their signature dishes on their menu.
