JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time goers will usually order the number 1 (Jinya Tonkotsu black $12.95). It's a pork based broth with thin noodles and standard ramen fixings such as nori, seasoned egg, green onion, garlic chips, etc. I like it so I recommended it to my friend who never had ramen before and he loved it.
