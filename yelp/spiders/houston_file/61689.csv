Baby Barnaby's////Came here while visiting town heard that it was a really good place to try. The reason I rated this place three stars was due to the service before eve entering the establishment we waiting a hour and 15 minutes before evening getting to sit down. The space is very limited inside, they have outside sitting but it was so hot. Our group wouldn't have even been able to enjoy our food . They make you signup on piece paper thats posted on a clipboard and you wait for them to call your name. The longest wait I think I've ever waited for. The food was really great itself I had no complaints about the food our server made sure to try and accommodate us for the long wait after being outside the whole time which was much appreciated by our group.
