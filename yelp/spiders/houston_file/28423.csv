The Pit Room////Overall, I really enjoyed my entire experience. We came on a Thursday night, so luckily we didn't have to wait in line. I heard it gets crazy busy on the weekends though! They serve canned beers and even have a bucket nearby where you can borrow a koozie! The condiment bar offers up tons of options like: pickled jalapeños, pickled onions, other types of pickled veges, salsa and different sauces and mustard.
