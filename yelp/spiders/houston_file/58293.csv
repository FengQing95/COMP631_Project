Baby Barnaby's////according to the quick tips, it seemed like the green eggs was the way to go.  it's scrambled eggs with spinach, artichokes, and jack cheese served with chicken applewood sausage, fried potato cubes, and toasted wheat bread.  as i waited for my food to come out, i got to watch the orange juice machine squeeze fresh orange juice.  i wish i knew that the refills were free!  she asked me if i wanted more, but i said no, because i thought it'd cost me another glass.  curses!  after i got bored of watching the oj machine, i finally mustered the courage to study for my a&p lab final, which was on the reporductive system.  everyone probably thought i was a total pervert.  o well.  the green eggs absolutely knocked my socks off!  iffs *munch* jufss sooo *munch munch* yummy!  the applewood sausage was warm, juicy, and full of flavor.  a little salty, a little sweet.  unfortunately, all i kept seeing was corpus spongiosum.  blast you a&p!
