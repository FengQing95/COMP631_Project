Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great place to celebrate a special occasion or just to hang out w friends! Service was wonderful and food was amazing. Attended a birthday dinner here last night and it was a great choice. We skipped apps and went straight to the BCK burgers, short ribs and shrimp and grits. These meals were def the highlights. My friends ordered their burgers well done and got medium well, once brought to the attention the waiter the chef cooked them new burgers to order and comped their bills, wow! The tomato salad was also pretty good. Less memorable was the avocado fresh salad (barely any avocado) and the green chili poblano soup. The black eyed peas sandwich missed the mark as well for me, the bread was just super tough and chewy. However everyone enjoyed their meals overall, their drinks and the ambiance. Unfortunately their DJ seemed to be MIA that night (apparently on weekends they have one come in after 9) but it was still fun times nonetheless. Found prices to be pretty reasonable & worth the quality of the food.
