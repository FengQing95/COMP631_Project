Kata Robata////We had a huge lunch before coming here, so regrettably, we only ordered a couple of things. For appetizer, we ordered salmon carpaccio, which was a happy hour menu. The sauce and topping perfectly complemented the thinly sliced salmon; it basically melted in my mouth. We also ordered the foie gras & duck with cold soba, which was amazing as well. I love how they incorporate foie gras into several of their dishes because I just love how rich and tender it is. This was my favorite of the night. Finally, we ordered the hot clams, which was pretty standard, came in a flavorful broth with a side of bread.
