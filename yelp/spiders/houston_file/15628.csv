JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So anyways, we always seem to have rude/uninterested staff when we go there. Maybe more coaching, training, more staff on so they can spend time dedicated to each table? Trust falls? Who know, just my two cents. Maybe in a month or so we will drop by and see if anything changed. We live next door. Thanks, good luck!
