JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Walking into Jinya feels like walking into an authentic ramen shop out of Japan. The bar at the front greets you with people sitting alone on their lunch break, but when you walk behind it opens into a much larger eatery. There's a communal eating table in the center of the room surrounded by smaller booths and another bar at the back. I recommend sitting at the back bar to watch how the ramen is made! Everything is delicious but my favorite is the garlic and pork based cha cha cha. Add a soft boiled egg to everything! You won't be disappointed. The meal add ons are also great if you have room with your ramen! You can add a salad and gyoza for a few extra bucks!
