Uchi////I would recommend filling your meal with the hot and cold tastings. For two, we usually order quite a lot (approx 6-7 plates, depending on how hungry we are). Each plate is small (a few bites) and meant to be shared. Some of our favorites: brussel sprouts, brie ringo, walu walu, hot rock, yokai berry, hamachi crudo. The specials are usually excellent. Â
