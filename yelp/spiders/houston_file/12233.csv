JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So, Im on one of my "trips" on the town. Ready to eat I'm in Jinya for a bite. I'm greeted and seated. After sitting there staring into space for I don't know how long, a girl approaches me and apologizes for how long I've been sitting there. I want to say Â "Thanks dear...I legit didn't notice how long I was sitting there because I live in the clouds." But I don't say that..I just smile like most normal humans would. waitress was quirky and knew her stuff. What you would expect from good waitstaff and all that jazz. I'll try to remember to ask for her name....haha.
