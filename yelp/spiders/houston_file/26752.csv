The Pit Room////I really enjoyed my experience with The Pit Room. Â Chopped brisket is my favorite and these guys did not disappoint. The brisket was lean with charred ends and good flavor. I chose it in sandwich form along with baked beans and sweet tea. I would highly recommend the brisket! My sweetie chose pork sausage and was also very happy with his selection. Service was quick and everyone was welcoming and helpful.
