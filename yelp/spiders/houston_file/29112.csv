The Pit Room////The inside of the restaurant was pretty busy so we elected to go out to the patio, which looks to be shared with the next door business. It's a very nice patio with a bar and TVs. It is definitely a good location to take in a sports game or two. The queso was yummy. The end. I loved the chips as well - you can definitely tell they are made in house. The brisket and ribs were awesome. The ribs were sooo tender and just literally melted away from the bone. I did not not really care for the BBQ sauce and it is not really needed to be honest. The food is just that good. The mac&cheese is not your grandma's, but I found it to have good flavor and was a nice accompaniment to my meal. The charro beans? Excelente. They were packed with so much flavor that just made you yearn for more.
