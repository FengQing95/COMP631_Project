Local Foods////Like any good Yelper, I found out about Local Foods from other Yelpers and I wasn't disappointed this time when I tried it out. I ate here with a chef friend for lunch before we were headed out shopping for the day. Not knowing anything about the menu or the restaurant before showing up was part of the surprise I wanted to have when walking in. I didn't want the reviews or pictures from other Yelpers to cloud my judgment of what I thought about this new place that offers up locally sourced ingredients.
