JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Was in from out of town. Have had ramen before and was not a fan. This was delicious. My husband had a spicy ramen and I had the pork chashu. Both were amazing. They were both full of flavor. In addition, our server was exceptional. Very good at refilling drinks without asking, Â knew ingredients in the food and quick to clear the table. He was also very helpful when we asked for suggesstions. I would definitely recommend it and will definitely stop by when we come back in to town.
