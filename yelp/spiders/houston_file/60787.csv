Baby Barnaby's////I ordered the green eggs, and everyone who's had them was right. It is delicious. It also comes with little hash browns, apple sausage, and toast. I honestly think the dish is fine without the sausage because the eggs have enough flavor by itself. I feel like the apple sausage overpowers the green eggs. What I liked about the eggs, was that it was not too rich. It also had a nice garlicky, buttery flavor as well.
