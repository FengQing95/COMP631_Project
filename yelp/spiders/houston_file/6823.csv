JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Waited almost 2 hours for food for my friends birthday dinner, but the food did not disappoint. I do not know if it was how hungry we were after waiting that long or the satisfaction of a large bowl of hot ramen, but we all demolished our food and some even ordered more noodles. Recommend but be wary of the long wait times.
