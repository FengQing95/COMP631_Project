Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Excellent kouign amann. I thought my husband overhyped it, but no, it's bigger than i thought,  pretty tasty and worth the $4 (well esp after seeing a video on how to make it)! Goes great with a cup of coffee. The dessert assortment is pretty good - macarons, cookies, tarts, cupcakes, etc. They also serve brunch items which is another reason for me to come back and try. We ordered and paid at the counter. We got our number and we seated ourselves.
