Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love coming here but I hate coming here. The food is wonderful and my favorite thing to get is the lavender latte. The worst thing about this place is there is little to room to sit and enjoy yourself. The tables are so close together you can't walk in between them without your butt running on someone. Clear out tables, get community tables or get a bigger space.
