Kata Robata////Came here during lunch with some friends. Very surprised because the service and food was fast and great despite being busy. I'd recommend ordering the brussel sprouts for an appetizer. They were cooked perfectly and exploded with lots of flavor. You can not go wrong with the sushi selection here, always quality and worth the bucks!!
