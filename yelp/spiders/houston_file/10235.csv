JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've always loved Jinya, the depth and flavor of their ramen has always stood out quite a bit better than competitors Ramen shops. But this review is based on my recent experience on a Thursday night, a friend and I knew we had 1 hour to get our ramen fix and leave before their closing. Our umami miso ramen came out 20 minutes later, it was warm and seemed like all the toppings has doubled just so the kitchen didn't waste any food at the end of the night. There wasn't much broth to even it out, and we were left with a very quite salty, heavy bowl of soup in which could not take another bite.
