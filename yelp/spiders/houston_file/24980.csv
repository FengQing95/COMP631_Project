Uchi////Dinner service starts at 5pm, with a line out the door before service even begins. They also do not seat incomplete parties, so make sure everyone arrives on time. Best thing about the Sake Social (besides the food and drinks) is that it's not limited to just the bar. Which means you can make a reservation for a table (highly encouraged).
