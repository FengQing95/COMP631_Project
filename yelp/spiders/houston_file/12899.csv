JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Same rating, but wanted to review update anyway. Jinya is awesome about accommodating individual order preferences. I wanted the sprouting up ramen but I don't eat pork, so they made it all chicken based. My partner doesn't eat vegetables (lol) so they made his without those. Some places will modify orders but seem really annoyed by it; our waiter was happy and helpful to accommodate our order. Just another reason jinya will always be a Houston fav!
