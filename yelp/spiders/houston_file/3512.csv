JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As a business owner, I always appreciate feedback whether it's positive or negative. I can tell based on your review that you are very experienced in ramen. Thus, you will agree that no two bowls of ramen are the same. I must have researched thousands of bowls of ramen before deciding to go with a franchise in Jinya. Why? It's because Jinya isn't traditional. Our founder's beliefs is that we want our ramen to be accepted by all types of people, which is why we offer 12 different kinds of ramen on our menu. Each and every ramen is different in its own way from the thickness of the broth to the type of noodle used to the toppings that go with it. One thing that I always stand by is that we will always "remake or replace" anything you do not enjoy on our menu.
