Baby Barnaby's////Me and the gee-eff frequent this spot for the plentiful corned beef hash. Holy...it comes on a bed of potatoes, toast with 2 eggs cooked to your preference. It may not sound like a lot, but IT IS A LOT. We usually leave full and unable to start the rest of our day. So. Much. Food. Which is good in this case since it is delicious. Â
