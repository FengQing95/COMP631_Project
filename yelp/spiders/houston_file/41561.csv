Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////- Croissant - $3.75 - this is probably the prettiest but average to below average tasting croissant I've ever had. The croissant is light and fluffy on the inside, but it was not as buttery as I would have liked. Also, the outer layers were slightly overbaked, so the slightly burnt flavor was overtaking the croissant. This probably would have tasted better if it were warm though.
