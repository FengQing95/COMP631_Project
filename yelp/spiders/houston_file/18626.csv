Uchi////Quite a few families there that evening as well. I'm all for families eating together, but... when I am sitting down at a nice restaurant for a 10 course $100+ a person dinner I'd rather not hear an infant crying and being fussy because someone decided not to hire a nanny. Do the rest of the of us a favor and Â hire a nanny, neighbor, or friend to watch your child if you anticipate eating out after bed time.
