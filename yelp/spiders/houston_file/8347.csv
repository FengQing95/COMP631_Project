JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Sompatsorn - I apologize for your disappointing visit to our restaurant. JINYA Ramen Bar is a California-based franchise concept, so I'm wondering if you have tried our ramen in Los Angeles. Here in Houston, we Â use the same recipes, ingredients and cooking protocols at all of our locations, and we get assessed on a regular basis by our corporate headquarters. I'm not sure why you found our broth lacking in richness and flavor. May I ask which ramen you ordered? We pride ourselves in customer satisfaction, so if you're ever dissatisfied with any of our food items, simply mention this to your server and he or she will be more than happy to replace your ramen or offer you something else to try.
