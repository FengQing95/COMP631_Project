JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Blake - Thank you for your review. We appreciate your patronage, and especially your patience when it comes to seating. But like the late, great Yogi Berra once said about a popular restaurant in New York: "Nobody goes there anymore -- it's too crowded." My only advice is to avoid peak-dining hours or to visit on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday evening when crowds tend to be lighter. As far as our pork-based ramen broth is concerned, you can always ask for "less oil" when ordering, which will lighten its heavy flavor profile. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you.
