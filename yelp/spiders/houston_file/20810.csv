Uchi////From the hot plates, the Hot Rock is always a fun dish, especially for children. I strongly recommend it for first-timers, though I don't think it's a value priced dish. Likewise, the Hamachi Nabe, a clay pot rice dish, is enjoyable but not substance-to-price friendly. My personal favorite is the saba shio, a grilled mackerel that's wonderfully salty, mellowed out by squirts of lemon.
