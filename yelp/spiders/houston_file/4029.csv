JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm going to ignore the fact that our waiter was a little bit rude and whatnot (maybe he was tired) (also they gave me the wrong order at first and he was still rude? lol) BUT the food was amazing. It was my first time and did not disappoint. I got the chicken ramen with veggies added. Broth was on point, chicken cooked well. I was impressed. Not a long wait at all for how busy it was. Reasonable prices. Definitely a hot spot. Definitely need this in Dallas, Tx.
