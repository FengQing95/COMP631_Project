JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Spicy chicken ramen is the way to go. It almost makes the wait bearable. Just almost. I always ask for the thick noodles because they're the kind that are kinky and curly and hold up better in the soup. I also ask for it mild so I can adjust the hot sauce levels myself. Fried Brussels are also awesome. Drinks are decent.
