The Pit Room////I was in town and was in the mood for beef ribs. Gave Pit's Barbecue a try. Boy did I make a great decision. The beef ribs were a little pricey but were to die for. It's by far the best beef ribs I have ever had. For the sides, i wouldn't recommend the mac and cheese but the potato salad was bery tasty. Defitenely my go to place for barbecue, whenever I'm in Houston again.
