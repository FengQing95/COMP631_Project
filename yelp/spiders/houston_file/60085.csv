Baby Barnaby's////I absolutely love their breakfast! The food is great and the prices a very reasonable. I could easily live off their biscuits (they are literally the best biscuits I've every had). Seating is tight and the restroom is extremely small.  Though its quite far from where I live,  I don't mind making the drive to the city every now and then. I high recommend trying it out.
