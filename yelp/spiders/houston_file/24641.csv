Uchi////I been to uchi 3 time, hoping that each time get better. I don't get the hype. Honestly it does not impress me. The food is ok, don't get me wrong it's not bad. I do expect it to be good considering you're spending at least $100+ per person. I been to the Uchi in Austin once, it does taste way better than the one in Houston. The Uchi in Austin is worth it.
