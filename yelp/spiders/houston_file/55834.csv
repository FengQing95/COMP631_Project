Kata Robata////Anyway, for starters I had the sashimi seaweed salad.  While this was good, it was by far the least interesting thing on the table. Husband got the Sashimi Combo with 3 dipping sauces and all three fishes (toro, sake, hamachi) were really excellent quality.  And yes the place is pricey, but I thought the portions were good.  My sweet girlfriend got the Miso Eggplant with Grilled Sushi Rice, from the vegetables list, and this was TO DIE FOR!  I'm not kidding.  Just the sauce I could've drank.  (Ew, I know.)
