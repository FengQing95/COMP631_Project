Kata Robata////The food and service here is always spectacular, but today it was even better.  I have newly discovered food allergies that include soy and ginger which eliminates quite a bit of the menu.  I know....why eat here?  I was dining with friends that should not suffer because of my dumb allergies.  Our server Hao was so nice when I asked about menu items.  When I told her about the weird allergies she went out of her way to tell me about the menu items without those ingredients and she brought me sauces that were tasty and free of all of the bad for me stuff.  Thanks Hao!
