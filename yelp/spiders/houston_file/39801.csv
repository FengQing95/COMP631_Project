Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Well I struck out on this one. Yesterday we celebrated my buddy's bachelor party and we wanted to stop here for lunch. From the get go our experience here was poor. We were seated promptly and quickly got to chatting and watching the game that was on the tv. Took around 5 minutes for some of us to get our drinks and about 25-30 for the remainder of our party to get their waters after we reminded the staff twice. We ordered our food and waited... and waited. Thinking our order was forgotten or hadn't ever been put in I asked how much longer it would take after another hour of waiting. At the 1.5 hour mark we got our food and it was disappointing. I had the pulled pork Benedict on biscuits with hollandaise. The biscuits were burnt on the bottom the potatoes were crunchy and completely dehydrated, the meat was dry as well. Honestly if we weren't already hungry and have waited so long we would have sent all the food back and left. Unfortunate experience as the environment and last dinning experiences have been great.
