JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We used to love this place, but $17 for a bowl of ramen!? Did you butcher the chicken in the back? I get the ramen fad, but two bowls of noodles and an appetizer shouldn't be a $60 dinner. Literally every other ramen place will run you about $35 for the same thing. Â Didn't expect a $5 per bowl increase over 2 years.
