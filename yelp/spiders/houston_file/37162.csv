Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is probably the nicest and elegant bar of It's kind. The drinks are beyond creative and delicious, and that's coming someone that does not like whiskey at all! They also have tons of other drinks besides whiskey that are tasty as well! We decided to get burgers and holy moly they were AWESOME!!! My fianc√© even said it was one the best burgers he had, and he's a bit of a hard-to-impress person when it comes to food, so that's saying a lot! The design and layout of this bar is stunningly gorgeous, tufted seats, wood elements throughout, and is by far one of the coziest bars ever I've been too. They even have a room with TONS of different whiskeys that you can look at. The service was welcoming, sincere, and thorough. The waiter explained many of items with great detail and passion, you can tell he has a passion for what he does. This place is unmatchable and I will be a returning patron, can't wait to go back! HIGHLY RECOMMEND, this place is place is one of a kind!
