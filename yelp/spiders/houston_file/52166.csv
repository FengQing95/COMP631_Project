Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a Houston brunch MUST!!! You should definitely put your name down on the waitlist online at least 45 minutes in advance of when you plan on dining because there is a long wait on weekends. Parking can be a bit of a headache, but usually I find street parking nearby and don't mind walking a bit to the restaurant. However, these minor inconveniences are well worth the quality and taste of the brunch. I love all of the pancake and mimosa flavors, and I'd especially order the Abri-ca-lav-ra mimosa over and over again. I'd also recommend picking two of the eggs benedict for a Benny Duo, AND try the the BACON BUT DIFFERENT (so sweet, spicy, crunchy, unique--I wish I had known about this one sooner)!!! I've been here countless times over the past 8 years, and Snooze food and service always meet my expectations.
