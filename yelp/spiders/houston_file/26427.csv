The Pit Room////Our dinner came with two sides. We chose mac n cheese and charro beans. The mac n cheese was so good! They used the big shell pasta and loaded it with cheese. You can't go wrong with this! The charro beans was soft, spicy and flavorful. We also ordered chicharrones, my favorite! It came out hot and crispy...oh so good! The only thing I'd complain about was that the seasoning was super salty. I wanted to eat it all but just couldn't. The house hot sauce that came with it as a dipping sauce was pretty bomb! Just the perfect hit of vinegar and spiciness. I'd definitely order this again but would tell them to leave off the seasoning. With the house hot sauce, seasoning on the chicharrones wasn't really necessary. At least not for my taste buds.
