Kata Robata////It's really a shame that the food is so good but the service is such a downer. I thought maybe it was just my experience but in looking over many other reviews I see that I am not alone in this. No one really smiles or greets you. This is a customer service business so the attitude of the staff makes a huge difference especially when paying big bucks for quality. There was a hair in our food today. Won't be back. Best of luck to this business but I want to go somewhere I feel welcome. Don't expect the host to say hello or goodbye to you either.
