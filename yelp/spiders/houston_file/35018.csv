Local Foods////Crunchy Chicken Sandwich: Chopped chicken, pretzel bits, potato chips, pickles, nut mixture and some kind of ranch dressing concoction that was finger-lickin good! Seriously, this sandwich has such simple ingredients but really WOW'd me! They load up the chicken too so it is definitely a filling meal. I don't repeat orders often but this is a winner to keep in mind!
