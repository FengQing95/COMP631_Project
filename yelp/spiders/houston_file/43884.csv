Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We tried the brioche and almond croissant. Both were delicious! My favorite is definitely the brioche because it was fluffy and not overly sweet. Almond croissant had a tad bit too much almond extract flavoring and NO REAL ALMONDS. You might as well call it an almond-flavored croissant because that's exactly what you get.
