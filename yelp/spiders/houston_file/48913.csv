Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast with the ladies this morning was fantastic!!!! First off, if you wanna eat at a decent time make sure you are early! This place gets PACKED. I ordered the pancake flight, this option allows you to choose 3 flavors or pancakes. I choose pineapple upside down which was BEYOND AMAZING!!!!!!!!! Whew it blew my socks off baby, I also got a cinnamon roll pancake which was very decadent and tasty! Lastly I opted to get French toast and by far it was the best French toast I've ever had! It has this creamy cheese filling. Omg sooooo good!!!! The bacon is thick center cut goodness and eggs were cooked perfectly! If you want an amazing breakfast try this place! Thank me later
