Uchi////This is my first time been to Uchi. Everything is great, the service, the ambiance, and the food presentation are awesome. Only the taste of the food and the quality of fish didn't live up to the hype. They are good but can be better. The wait time for roll/sashimi/nigiri becomes long (~30 min) around 7 PM.
