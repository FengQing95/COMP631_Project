Baby Barnaby's////I had the breakfast plate & it comes with SO MANY POTATOES you can't even come close to finishing! The eggs were delicious as well but my favorite part was the incredible biscuits. They are sweet and savory at the same time and just heavenly. My husband had breakfast tacos and he cleaned his plate. He absolutely loved the chorizo and cheese.
