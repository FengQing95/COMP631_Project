The Pit Room////Texas Monthly loves this place. Me... not so much. Got a sliced brisket sandwich and a chicken taco. The chicken taco was overly greasy, and the tortilla was a bit too doughy. The brisket was dry, with almost a mealy texture. Maybe I was there on an off day, but I wouldn't expect a top BBQ place to have such an off day. I've had better brisket at just about any other place in Houston. The iced tea was really good.
