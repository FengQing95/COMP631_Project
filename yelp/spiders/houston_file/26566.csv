The Pit Room////Ordered the three meat plate which is $17.75, and was really happy with the price for how much food I got.  Everything came out right away, as you can see them cutting and weighing everything in front.  Brisket, ribs, and Venison sausage.  All really well done, I think I like Gatlins pork ribs a bit better, but what you going to do?  Brisket had the right amount of bark, nice smoke ring, lots of meaty smoky flavor.  The Venison sausage was amazing, house made and actually had a lot of heat to it.  The casing and coarseness of the sausage was perfect.  Sides of charro beans, and mac & cheese.  Both really on point. Maybe I shouldn't have been, but I was surprised in a very good way with the amount of spice and heat that everything had. I can't believe I am saying this, but they even give you a good piece of white bread..not that Wonder Bread crap, and have a condiments bar that is almost worth the price alone as well.
