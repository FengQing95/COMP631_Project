JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really hate when I have to hunt down someone and ask for my bill!  It turns out I was charged .50 extra for more garlic oil without notice.  You know it's the principle that ticks me off not the money.  Why so sneaky and not forthright?  Well after I took matters in my hands I felt much better :)!
