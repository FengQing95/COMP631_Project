Local Foods////Food was delicious and service was good. I got the albacore tuna sandwich and my daughter got a chicken sandwich, they both were soooo yummy! I enjoyed every bit. I got a side of their kale with gold raising and it was so good! I'm not giving them 5 starts because my glass of wine smelled like eggs, like really really bad, even the waiter smelled and agreed on how bad it was, he went and spoke with I don't know who (manager?) but he came saying "they said they gonna check on the glasses so they don't smell and it doesn't happen again" I was thinking really?! I don't care! I was expecting them to offer me a new glass of wine because I barely could down half of it without gagging and wanting to puke! I couldn't believe they didn't even offer me my money back but hey, that's what in MY opinion a good manager would have done so I left because didn't want to ask for my money straight forward ugh!!
