JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Four stars for the wait each and every time.  I'd come here more often but sometimes I just want to eat without having to wait 45 minutes. The food is always delicious and the service is pretty good.  I don't love the set up of the community tables as if you come with a large group it's difficult to engage everyone in your party.
