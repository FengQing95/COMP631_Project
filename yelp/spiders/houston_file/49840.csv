Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was hangry. I wanted everything on the menu. I decided on the snooze classic - Three eggs scrambled, chorizo, hash brown and side of toast. There's an option to switch out the toast or hash brown for any pancake for an additional $4. HELL YES SIGN ME UP! I got (1) pumpkin pancake. No regrets guys. The waitress said one would be enough and its quite big. Boy was she correct. It was bigger than my face.
