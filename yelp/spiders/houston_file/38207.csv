Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Traveling alone, so I belly up to the bar.  But, what made the whole meal?  The bartender - I asked him to recommend a local beer.  He asked what I liked and then just poured it.  No samples, no questions - just bold, unabashed confidence in his palate.  I like it!  And, he was right - he picked a beer that was unique and different and I really enjoyed it.  He was prompt, he was attentive.   Staff was really with it!
