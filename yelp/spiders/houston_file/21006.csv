Uchi////We were blown away by the service and atmosphere the first time we dined here. Sushi was fun and fresh. I usually opt for traditional sushi and omakase experiences, but the waiter won me over; he was fantastic, offering recommendations and tips. So we went back to celebrate our anniversary, thinking this was the standard experience. It was awful. The waitress took 10 mins to greet us after we were seated. Speaking of seating, they sat us in between two large one groups, one of which was a group of five guys pounding sake for 2 hours and completely trashed (they ordered no food). So much for a nice experience. The waitress continued to disappoint. She was very reticent to offer recommendations and was super defensive when we asked if we had ordered one or two pieces of something bc we couldn't remember what we ordered. She probably couldn't hear us over the party at the next table and misunderstood. She continued to have this odd, defensive and unhelpful attitude throughout which further soured the experience. The sushi was good overall, but what's the point if you can't enjoy it because your waitress is having a bad day and the table next to you belongs at a bar.
