Baby Barnaby's////Visiting from Arizona.... but a Texas native, this place makes me miss home. I remember going here many years ago, and the breakfast is just as good now as it was then. Had the breakfast plate, everything was fantastic, but the highlight for me was the grits... Oh how I miss grits, perfectly lumpy and yet creamy, wash this all done with fresh and cold grapefruit juice. This is what I miss most about Texas, the food and the people. A local restaurant with great customer service and food which have remained a consistent cornerstone in Houston.
