JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Aww guys... when I tell you, they taken ramen noodles to a whole other level, I mean extreme noodles times ten. We started with pork gyoza with their Gyoza sauce. It almost tasted as if it had a hint of pickled Ginger in the pork mixture, giving it a great after taste. Along with crispy chicken bites made with dark meat. Very tasty. Then came the the Ramen noodles....wow! Medium spicy.chicken  ramen noodles with all the fixings and 48 hour soy sauce soaked egg almost completely cooked boiled egg. AMAZING! of course we had cocktails.... For dessert,  we had mocha and green tea ice cream or yogurt balls with firm jelly coat. Wonderful natural flavors with texture. I am huge fan of their dessert texture ice cream balls. Fun and engaging work staff.... I will return! Cheers to a great experience.
