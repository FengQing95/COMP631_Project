Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was in Austin for a week and couldn't get enough of Snooze. Their specialty pancakes were literally the best I have ever had and the bacon is to die for. The servers were so friendly and so helpful since this was my first visit to Austin. FYI ...on the weekend call for a reservation.
