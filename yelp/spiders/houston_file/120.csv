JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's great to find a place that serves authentic ramen with large menu. Most places have one or two options, but at Jinya's you can customize it however you want. The place is small, but the environment is great. The staff is always nice and helpful, and the food comes out fairly quickly. Every time I come, I get seated at the long tables that they have in the middle. When it gets busy, there's a chance that there's another party sitting at the opposite end of the table, so if you're not into that you might want to request a booth. My favorite so far is the tonkatsu assuri with an egg. I would warn about getting extra noodles because they already serve a pretty healthy portion of noodles. Unless you have a huge appetite, the first serving is plenty enough. Also, I usually park in the garage on elgin, right after milam street. It's free and you just have to walk around the block to get to the restaurant.
