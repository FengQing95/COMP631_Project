The Pit Room////Here's a tip.  If you own a restaurant in Montrose, try not to piss off your customers.  They will go elsewhere.  There's better BBQ nearby and I used to enjoy this place and it was very convenient to where I live, but for a $33.00 beef rib and a coke, you don't get to piss me off on top of the $33.00.  So you're on the no go list for a while now while we dine at your competition and explore other options.
