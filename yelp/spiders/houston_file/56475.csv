Kata Robata////The service was excellent as well.  Our waiter took his time to talk with us, share a few stories, and he made us feel welcome and appreciated.  Also, for 8:30pm on a Wednesday night the restaurant was absolutely packed and there was barely any parking in the lot!  Always a good sign.
