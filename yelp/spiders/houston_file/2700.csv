JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went on one Saturday. It was around 3-4pm and the restaurant was packed . We got seated quick. The interior was cool and modern. I thought I would love it till this point. After we got the seats , we were handed the menu and the waitress left . It is okay since the restaurant seemed so busy . But my good impression was gone from this moment. Another couple went after us, sat next to our table , and got served by the same waitress, she handed them menu, asked them what to drink and had her chatting with them. I tried to catch her attention but she seemed not getting it. She was having a happy talk and keep ignoring us for more than 10 mins . After she brought out drinks and ramen bowls for that tablet, she finally remembered us and be back to us . I lost my happy mood.
