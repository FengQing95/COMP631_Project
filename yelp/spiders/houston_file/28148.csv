The Pit Room////I first hit up The Pit Room last week which was also their opening week.  An employee of mine and I went in anticipating good BBQ and they didn't disappoint.  I had a 1/2 lb of brisket, a beef link and a venison link and it was magical.  My employee had a 1/2lb of fatty brisket and the chicken and he was beyond happy.  We both sat there and realized we had come upon a gold mine and that getting in and out for lunch in 45 minutes wouldn't last long.  The line did move quick, I'd say we were there a total of 5 minutes in line with a half dozen or so people in front of us and by time we sat down there were a dozen or more behind us.  The good thing here is the line moved fast.  Really fast!
