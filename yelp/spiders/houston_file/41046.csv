Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I've been to this restaurant twice for business meetings, every time that I've gone, the staff is professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. The food is delicious! My favorite appetizer is the pork belly bites. I've tried several dishes even though I've only been there twice as my friends and I try each other's plates. The saints have been tasty as well. I really enjoyed their Old Fashioned. The ambiance is laid back and mellow, the noise level isn't too loud, we have been able to speak comfortably without having to whisper or yell. I highly recommend this place for any occasion from reseving a business meetings to date night.
