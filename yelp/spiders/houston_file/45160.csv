Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My favorite items here are the croissant and chocolate chip walnut cookie. I think Common Bond recipes for the savory items are tastier than the sweet pastry items.  I tried a lot of items before and after Common Bond was bought out by the Mandola group.  For the most part I think the sale was for the better.  Increase parking space with an additional lot 2 blocks down.
