The Pit Room////The best BBQ I have had in Houston. Such a gem. The meat is tender and flavorful - I love the brisket. The homemade pickles rock! The sausages were just average. The turkey was juicy and so good. Really a great place. The pickle bar with everything else is really great too. You should certainly try this place!
