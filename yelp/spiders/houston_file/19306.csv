Uchi////I went to Uchi for the first time yesterday to celebrate my birthday. A friend of mine recommended this place and I'm so glad she did! They seated me at the bar where I was able to engage the Sushi Chef Yoshi, who was very friendly and recommended some items from the happy hour menu before it ended. I'm glad he did because they were all so delicious! First I was served Uchiviche, followed by Machi Cure, and finally Walu Walu. For dinner I tried a variety of different dishes: the hot rock with Wagyu Beef, Karaage, Biendo, and Ham & Eggs. For dessert I tried the Peanut Butter Semifreddo which was like peanut butter and jelly when everything was mixed together. A true testament to them is it's hard to say which was my favorite thing I had. If I really had to pick one I'd say it was the Ham & Eggs because the 2 sauces they give with it really added to the enjoyment of it. Everything was so well balanced, nothing overly aggressive on my palate.
