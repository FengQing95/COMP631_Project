Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I was in charge of providing the cake for a milestone birthday celebration this year (someone's 30th). A delicious/beautiful cake was at the top of the birthday girls list. I called in and ordered a strawberry champagne cake from Common Bond. My request was that it would be ready on the day of the dinner. Fast forward to the day/evening of the dinner: ...after about fifteen minutes of waiting at the register and lots of scurrying around behind the counter I'm approached by the manager. ..and with him come the chilling words "I have some bad news". The short version is that he was EXTREMELY apologetic and showed great concern for my situation. I have no doubt that he took the matter seriously. I got a full refund and was also given a chocolate cake to take in place of the custom cake I'd originally planned to show up with. I'm giving three stars for his ability to make up (in part) for other people's mistakes. Great customer service. I can't say they lost my business. I just wouldn't trust them with another cake needed for a celebration event.
