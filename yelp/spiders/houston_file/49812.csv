Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It's been a long time since I have been to this location but I remember it vividly. The wait was very long as it is a popular restaurant. The food is good and the wait staff is very nice. I wouldn't mind going back but not if there is a line. The food is good but not worth a long wait.
