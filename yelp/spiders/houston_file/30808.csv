The Pit Room////I got a one meat plate with brisket, macaroni and cheese, and charred okra. The brisket was perfectly melt-in-your-mouth and I loved the sauce served with it. Macaroni and cheese was a little watery (if that's a thing?) but had good flavor. The charred okra was spicy and a little too salty.  I tried my friend's jalapeño sausage with mustard dipping sauce and it was very tasty.
