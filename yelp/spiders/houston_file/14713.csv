JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Had an early great dinner with family at Jinya's Midtown location yesterday. It was a perfect time to had a hot soup in a cool weather. I always love the sprouted up   ramen. My husband loves black tonkatsu  ramen. Since it's happy hour we ordered the to die for jinya bun and salmon poke tacos. We love the takoyaki ball ever. And to mention, we got serve with very attentive nice lady name Alex! She always checked on us if everything was okay and if we need anything! Having a great dinner and a very nice server made your family dinner complete!!!!
