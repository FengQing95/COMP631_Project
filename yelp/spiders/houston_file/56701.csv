Kata Robata////-our final dish (they were going to give us one more but we were stuffed at this point and so we were able to stop the adventure here): were 4 different sushi pieces. The toro (to compare to the otoro before), uni, eel (it was steamed but I couldn't find the exact name on the menu), and one that I think is the mackerel? Can't seem to remember it but it was more run of the mill cuts.
