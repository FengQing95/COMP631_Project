Local Foods////I am ADDICTED to the house smoked salmon sandwich on a pretzel bun with soba noodles and chips. It is always my comfortable, go-to meal whenever I stop by (which is pretty often). Their service is wonderful, how the sandwich is assembled is very organized, and the taste is impeccable.
