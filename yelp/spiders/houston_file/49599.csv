Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went for the first time on Thursday. There was no wait and I was seated within a few minutes of entering. I had the Mm Mm Mimosa, egg white scramble with hash browns and sourdough toast, and one "Nana's hot chocolate" pancake. The mimosa was really good and didn't give me a headache even though I hadn't eaten before taking a few sips of it. The egg white scramble was just okay. It was wet and lacked seasoning. I added salt, pepper, and hot sauce but it could have really used a hit of garlic salt or onion powder during cooking. The hash browns were good and the sourdough toast came with some sort of preserves that was delicious. The hot chocolate pancake was the star! It had white chocolate chips, toasted walnuts, a huge homemade marshmallow and a decadent chocolate sauce. It was also the size of a large plate. I shared it with my friend and we both agreed that it was fantastic. Our waiter disappeared on us a few times and we saw a couple of people who arrived after us, get their food before we did, but all in all I enjoyed Snooze and will definitely be returning.
