Kata Robata////Fresh and delicious sushi at a high price point. I recommend coming here during happy hour if you want to eat your fill, and not pay over $30. They also give you a free dessert on your birthday. I got the green tea cheesecake and it was bitter and terrible, but that's probably just personal preference. I've been here multiple times for dinner, and the parking and customer service have never been an issue. Always make a reservation ahead of time because this place gets packed easily. My mother accidentally left her credit card here once, and they gave it back to her the next day when she returned.
