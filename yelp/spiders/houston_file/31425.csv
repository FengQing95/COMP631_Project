Local Foods////I've been here twice and have had stellar experiences both times. The service is always fast and syper friendly. The atmosphere is very chill and the place is kind of dark inside and quaint, which I like. I will say I'm not a vegan or vegetarian which I think impacted some of my feelings towards certain menu items. First, their egg salad sandwich is amaaaaaaaazing. Best thing on the menu. Award winning. Highly recommend. The kale side is good, but not great. The vegan potato salad was underwhelming. I wanted so bad to like it, but it was honestly pretty bland. I make vegan potato salad at home all the time and it's amazing, so I was disappointed there. The chicken orzo soup (?) Is delicioussssss. The lime makes it. It has that nice citrusy bite and is warm, salty, and savory. The crusted chicken sandwich is really good. Not mind-blowing like the egg sandwich, but really good. Their chips are also fantastic, as is their soda selection (can you say orange cream soda and original pure cane Dr Pepper?! Yum!). I definitely recommend this place, especially to vegetarians or those looking to eat healthy and local.
