The Pit Room////If you're doing for dinner, especially on a Friday or Saturday night you may want to try parking on a close by side street and taking a short walk there, instead of hoping to find a parking spot. They have their own lot on the side and it seems relatively large, probably would take 20 cars or so, but it was completely full when we went on Friday around 530 pm. There are a lot of side streets so like I said, may want to give that a try. Will definitely be back next time I'm craving tons of meat and BBQ.
