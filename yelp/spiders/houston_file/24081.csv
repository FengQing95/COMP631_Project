Uchi////I came here this weekend with my girlfriend to celebrate my birthday, and was pleased with the immediate but subtle congratulations the waitstaff gave me, both at the front and at my table. Uchi provided a scallop crudo ($20) on the house as a gift, which was very much appreciated. The dish was boldly flavored and came with plenty of spice and acid, with a pleasant texture from the scallop and tomato. The only gripe I had with the dish was that the delicate sweetness from the scallop was overshadowed by the bold flavors. I also ordered the fried yucca (solid, $6), the sous vide short ribs (interesting and tasty, $8), and a couple different nigiri. My favorite sushi piece was the bluefin chutoro ($12), although it is difficult to disappoint when you're dealing with such an amazing fish. The highlight of the night was certainly the ham and eggs ($10.5), which is a crispy pork belly sushi roll served with an egg yolk-mustard dipping sauce. It is an amazing balance of textures and rich flavors that might seem a bit odd at first but is probably one of the tastiest (if not overpriced!) things on the menu. The only dish I got here again that I had in the Austin location was the walu walu ($8), and I have to just barely give an edge to the Austin rendition. We also tried a spicy sake (salmon) roll ($6), which was a nicely executed salmon avocado roll with salt in place of soy sauce providing a more clean and unadulterated flavor.
