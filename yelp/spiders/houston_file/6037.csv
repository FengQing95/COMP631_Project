JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But here's the main thing everyone is waiting for-- the ramen! I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen --- BEST ramen in Houston, hands down. The thing that brings it together is the BROTH. So much flavor, it's amazing. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy. He liked it a lot, but I still liked mine better. He finished everything, but I had to get mine to go because I also wanted to try the dessert. We got the Annin Tofu (sweet almond pudding) and WOW, it was the perfect ending to a pretty epic meal. It wasn't too sweet and just light enough after a hearty bowl of ramen.
