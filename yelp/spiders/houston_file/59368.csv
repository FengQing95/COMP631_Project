Baby Barnaby's////Note: there is a clipboard you will need to sign if there is a wait. If you have never been, go up to the entrance and you will see it. You can also ask the waitstaff how long the wait is. They will usually give you a longer estimated time than it will actually take. They also have water (free) and coffee (the coffee is not free) available as you wait.
