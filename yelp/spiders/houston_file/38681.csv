Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Firstly we decided to show up a little early and have some drinks on the patio! Half price bottle of wine and discount on the local beers (thanksgiving special) was a great starter to our evening! we were well looked after by the staff and when it came time to eat we were promptly served a delicious thanksgiving meal, with my gluten intolerance being looked after too! We were actually served by the owners which was a lovely gesture, you could see all of them being really attentive and helping out on such a rush crazy holiday! I didn't expect it.
