Kata Robata////The ramen me and my gf had, shoyu and spicy soy ramen, are the best ramen we've ever had in US. I'm a ramen enthusiast so I've been trying ramen everywhere from Torrence, CA to Ippundo in NY and none of them satisfy my taste. Ramen at Kata Robata nails everything; the soup, noodle, topping, everything is so well put-together but the price is quite high for a bowl of noodle. Service, however, is not great. We waited for 10-15 minutes for a waitress to notice us and another 10-15 minutes for food to come. Inside is a typical Americanized Asian restaurant, which means dark and loud, so it's not really my taste. I haven't tried their sushi yet so my #1 sushi place is still Sushi Miyagi but for ramen Kata Robata is definitely a place to go.
