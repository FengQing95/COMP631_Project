Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place might have a line and a wait but there's a reason for it. If you love breakfast the menu is absolutely phenomenal. Sugar was our server and she is so pleasant. French toast to classic breakfast to egg whites fertitta. Delicious!! I will be back for the booze and bubbles over the weekend!
