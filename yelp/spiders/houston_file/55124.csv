Kata Robata////Amongst my favorite dishes are the ceviche, fresh octopus, hamachi & jalapenos, kakuni pork belly, lobster salad, and miso ramen. Everything is just full of flavor! Your mouth will not be bored. And these are all innovative twists on your standard japanese foods, so enjoy the creativity in the edible art.
