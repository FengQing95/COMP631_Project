JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend were on our way back home to Dallas and decided to stop for a quick lunch. We went in right at opening and were the first ones there. Good thing we got there when we did because very shortly (as in as soon as we sat down) herds of people started coming in from their lunch break. It soon got crowed but that didn't stop our server from being attentive and awesome.
