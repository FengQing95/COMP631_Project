Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Soft-scrambled eggs were described as "mushy eggs" by my sister, but I thought they weren't bad.  I wouldn't get them again, as they are slowly cooked in a skillet with a healthy dose of butter, but it was a good experience :D  It was garnished with tasty fried flower blossoms~
