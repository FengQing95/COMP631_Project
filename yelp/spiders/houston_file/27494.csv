The Pit Room////I've tried BBQ all  over the U.S. and I have to admit that Texas has the best.. I stopped by this place because it was close to the museum after my visit.  I've already been back and I have to admit that the sausage and the homemade pickles and sauces are delicious.  I ordered the brontosaurus rib and sides as well and crushed them as if it was the first time.  Since my first visit they've added on a bar next door where you can sit down and eat while enjoying some delicious beers..   I ate and drank til my heart was content and vowed to stop in whenever I come into town.. Customer service was awesome which was just as good if not better than the food.. I really appreciate everyone that's there.. Do yourself a favor and stop in on an empty stomach and thirsty..
