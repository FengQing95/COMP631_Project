Baby Barnaby's////Green eggs: if you've read Green Eggs and Ham, don't expect your eggs to look like so but have no fear. these eggs were the creamiest things I've ever eaten. I donut understand. y u so yummy?! idk what else to say except it was just so good. I wouldn't mind ordering this over and over. It's one of those dishes that make you want to figure out how to make on your own but I don't even know how to start. Now I fear that future scrambled eggs I will consume just won't cut it. Thanks a lot!
