JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very Knowledgable staff, extremely knowledgeable! Anna helped us, it was the first time to a ramen bar, and definitely found the right veggie dish for me, the spicy ramen, with tofu and no pork! They don't have rice noodles, that will be much better, and most things on the help menu, that are pre taken, aren't at the Houston locations, which is unfortunate but in Vegas and Florida they are.... Will have to make a trip for that or wait for it to be available in Houston.
