JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Freakin' awesome. Nuff said. Had the spicy chicken ramen, black tonkotsu, and sprouting (I think that's what it's called). Also had the chocolate/green tea mochi ice cream and the crispy chicken. Black tonkotsu is out of this world awesome, sprouting ramen and spicy chicken ramen are pretty good, crispy chicken was nothing amazing. Good tho. Green tea / chocolate mochi ice cream was delightful. Awesome amazing experience tho. Went here two nights in a row lol.
