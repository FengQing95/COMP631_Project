JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Whenever we miss packing an item for a to-go order, we create an incident report so that we can track our staff members' mistakes. However, we also have firsthand experience wherein UberEats and DoorDash drivers have removed items from orders and even have failed to deliver orders after picking them up from our restaurants. We have no control over these incidents, and despite our efforts to determine cause, we receive the same response from these third-party delivery app companies: Instruct your guest to request a refund.
