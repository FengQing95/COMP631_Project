Baby Barnaby's////The bf and I had just gotten done with helping with a boot camp event and we were starrrrving. It's a small place, but easily noticeable with the lack of parking on the street. First good (or bad) sign, depending on how you look at it. The second good sign was that it was busy, busy, busy! As others have mentioned, make sure you sign yourself in to the waitlist. Saturday morning brunch, so of course it was packed.
