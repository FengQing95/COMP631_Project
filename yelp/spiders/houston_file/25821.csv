The Pit Room////Not sure how this place has so many stars. My husband and I ate there and I ordered a sliced brisket sandwich. The brisket was tough, mostly fat and not very flavorful. The sauce was thick and vinegary and the potato salad did not contain many potato chunks. It was 90% mayonnaise/mustard sauce. My husband's chopped brisket sandwich was pre-chopped and dry. If our food was typical of this restaurant, they will not last long in a city accustomed to superb barbeque. We will not be going back to The Pit Room.
