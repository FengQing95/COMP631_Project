JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have to be honest and say I'm not a major fan of this place, but it's not their fault.  I can't say that I enjoy any type of "soup" and that is basically what this is - noodle soup.  But I can say this establishment is always clean and has good service.  Since I'm not a fan of noodle soup, I usually wind up eating the veggies and meat after I get tired of sipping soup and the veggies have been somewhat crisp and the meat is good.  I do like their spicy ramen and it's likely the only one I've almost entirely eaten, broth and all.
