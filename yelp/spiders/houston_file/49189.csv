Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I stopped into Snooze after a day in downtown Houston. The parking situation is not great as the lot is quite tight. I would recommend getting there relatively early as they run out of parking spots pretty quick. We were greeted immediately upon entering and were seated quickly as well.
