Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We ordered our drinks and it took around 10 minutes for us to receive it. Took another 10 minutes to place our order bc our waitress was no where to be found, and took around 25 minutes to get our food. The overall wait time was extremely long. Not sure if our waitress was busy with other things, but her service was slow (but she was nice and apologized for the wait).
