Kata Robata////Came here with a few friends.  I ordered the curry noodle dish and was not as pleased as others were with theirs.  It is a very small portion (especially for the price).  The flavor wasn't as strong as I would have preferred. I tried my other friend's dishes and if you do go, order either the Lobster Mac and Cheese or the Chashu (pork belly) bowl.  The ramen isn't to die for and the price makes it not truly worth it.  The Chashu bowl has the most bang for your buck.  Both of the above dishes were very good and you will not be disappointed with either.
