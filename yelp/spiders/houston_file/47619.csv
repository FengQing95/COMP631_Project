Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My actual food took about 10-15 minutes to arrive, and here's the kicker. When I got my food, every thing was COLD!!! The egg -cold, the gravy on the pot pie -cold, the french toast-cold, hash brown-cold and burnt (how, Sway???). What the ech, e, double hockey sticks happened between me placing my order and them bringing it to me a few minutes later?!?! Was it just sitting on a counter in the back for an extended period of time waiting to be picked up?!?!
