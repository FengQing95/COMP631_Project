Uchi////We were seated at a community table by the door but it was no issue because they set up these beautiful flower vases (with real flowers which is always impressive) right in between you and the next guest over so you actually feel like you get pretty good privacy as if it were a separate table. We only wanted to try their HH so we order everything off their makimono and tastings minus the okashi (dessert). My favorite was definitely the walu walu or seared escolar. It was so juicy and just perfect. We ended up getting another one because it was that good. I also enjoyed the ham and eggs roll because the pork belly was perfection with all the different sauces they had on the plate. Everything else was good but not so phenomenal that I find the need to mention it in my review. Ended the night with their fried milk dessert of course. I just can't bring myself to try their other desserts when fried milk is all I think about. What a dilemma!
