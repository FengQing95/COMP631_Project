Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a 5-star location, food is amazing, coffee is really good. But the crowd is really thick.  The line was out the door.  Not the best location for a group of more than 4 people.   See my pic, not sure what I ate but it was gluten free and tasted amazing!
