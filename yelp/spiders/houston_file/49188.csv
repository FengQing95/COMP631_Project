Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Although I live in Dallas I am in Houston like once a month. The first time I tried snooze was in April. My friends had told me such good things about it so I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. I ordered the Chile Verde Benny, one with pork and one with barbacoa (I cant remember which one I like better so I just order one of each) and OMG! French toast! Both of these selections are to die for. I want to highlight the French toast because I am not a coconut fan but I this was delicious! I didn't even taste the coconut tbh the Benny were delicious too. I'm the type of person who once i find something good I order the same thing every time afraid to try something new. I have been back twice since then and ordered the same thing. If you have time on your hands and I mean a lot of time i would def try this place. The wait will be a couple hours but I mean who wouldn't wait for great food! Enjoy
