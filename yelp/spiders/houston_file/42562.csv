Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries look beautiful but very refined. They are so perfect it seems they aren't real. Not a crumb out of place. Frankly, I like my baked goods a little messy around the edges. The almond croissant was big and fluffy. It kind of collapsed as I bit into it. Very rich and buttery. As I only had the one pastry and some ridiculously strong coffee (no amount of milk would thin it out and there was no cream), I can only report my observations.
