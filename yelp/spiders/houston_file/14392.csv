JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Guuuuuuuuuuuurl you got to try this place.  There is ramen, and then there is JINYA.  Lawd try the tempura brussel sprouts and JINYA bun.  To die for.  I could easily eat here at least twice a week.  Definitely in my personal top ten... top five. The atmosphere is very nice.
