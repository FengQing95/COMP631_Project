Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service sucks.  I hate places that give you the option of a tip when you pay but do absolutely nothing for you.  They could not or would not even offer much help when ordering.  Nobody told you about the specials, no one would describe the dishes to you.  They seemed to think you were lucky to stand in line.  I looked at other peoples dishes.  They looked way better than what I ordered but since there was no information offered even when I asked it was difficult to know what to order.  Your staff need an attitude adjustment.  You are lucky to have customers not the other way around.  Don't come here you will be disappointed.
