Baby Barnaby's////New favorite Houston brunch spot! The green eggs are totally worth the hype and calories and taste similar to a spinach artichoke dip with perfectly cooked eggs. The apple sausage and crisp potatoes were equally drool worthy. Minus one star for the wait and somewhat curt service but we'll definitely return! Nice indoor or outdoor seating options. Curious to try their lunch too. FYI breakfast is served daily until 2pm
