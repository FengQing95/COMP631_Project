Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Came here trying something new while on a weekend getaway. It was so delicious! The wait was quick for a party of 6. The staff was very friendly and helped with recommendations. The french toast was to die for with quality syrup. The eggs benedict was top notch. The real stand out was the hash browns. Definitely recommend this place!
