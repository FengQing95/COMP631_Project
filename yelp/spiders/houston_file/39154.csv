Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I went here for my birthday and our server was an absolute doll! He was funny and knowledgeable. It did take us a while to get our food but when it came it was totally worth it. Very high quality! Be aware the menu is very limited. The drinks are delicious, the ambiance is amazing.! I do wish they would serve bread since their food takes so long.
