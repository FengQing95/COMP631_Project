Uchi////I live in Los Angeles and have been to numerous sushi restaurants.  I am not the hugest fan of sushi but enjoy it from time to time; however, this has got to be one of the tops 10 restaurants I have had the pleasure of dining at.  We ordered the vegetarian and regular 6 course dining options and both blew us away. There was not a course that did not impress us.  Then, to top it off, the cilantro desert was unexpected and amazing.  Definitely give this place a try.  I was only in Houston for an overnight layover, but I will need to come back here soon.
