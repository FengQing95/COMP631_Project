Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The macarons were very good. The chocolate chip cookie, quite respectable. But, the Brioche was a little burned. I'll go back to try other things in the future. For a Saturday afternoon and being the new bakery hot spot, the line wasn't too long. The parking was a bit of a mess, though.
