Local Foods////I've been here multiple times and always get the Garden Veggies Sandwich, but this time I tried the Salad. The salad was a salad... the green dressing was a bit sour yet tasty. There was fruits: dragon fruit, strawberries and greens included in the salad. Although it was overpriced, I still got it. I would say it was okay and definitely think the sandwiches are more worth the price .
