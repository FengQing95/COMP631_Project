JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with medium spice level and with the thick noodles. I asked for an extra order of noodles and was told it is already put in. Which is strange because at most locations they give it to you on the side, I got charged $2.50 for it and I am not even sure if received any extra noodles because it looked the same as everyone else's bowl. The broth tasted so good and it was perfectly spiced, I ordered some mushrooms and some corn as extras. I was able to finish about half and took the other half home in a nice container. I did not want to be full and it tasted really good the next day after heated up. I ordered a chicken bowl, there was only two slices of chicken in the entire bowl, so I do not really understand that at all.
