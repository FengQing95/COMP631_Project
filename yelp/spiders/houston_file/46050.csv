Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I am used to having to wait at coffee shops because their drinks require time + wait time. It's a given. This time, however, the bakery wasn't really packed and the queue was just forming as we were leaving. Back to the point of the coffee ... It was extremely hot and tasted really off. Maybe the milk had gone bad in the latte they used for mine. Not exactly sure but you can judge for yourself why the color of the two lattes is so different. My sister loved hers while mine tasted like it was made by a barista on his/her first day at Starbucks hungover AF.
