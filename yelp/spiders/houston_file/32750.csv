Local Foods////The menu has a variety of healthy foods with a trendy twist.  You will find all kinds of unique sides like kale, barley, ect.  The first visit I got the infamous chicken sandwich on pretzel bun.  It wasnt really anything to write home about.  The second time I got the Fall Harvest Salad, which was kinda weird but pretty delicious. Two complaints were A.  they were out of goat cheese (pretty much the only reason why I wanted the salad) and B.  They chicken added on was cold.  For some reason I hate cold chicken and get annoyed when a restaurant cant offer it warm (I even asked them to).
