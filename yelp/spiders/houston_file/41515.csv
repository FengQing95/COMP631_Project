Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It gets 5-stars for being a bona-fide bakery IN HOUSTON!!! that actually serves an awesome croissant.  It gets 3 stars for making the croissant the size of your head and the head of the guy next to you ... and charges you for it.  Average is therefore 4 stars.  Repeat review for all baked goods.
