Local Foods////My absolute favorite is the Gulf Shrimp And Blue Crab. It converted me from a hot-sandwich girl to a who-gives-a-crap-what-temperature-it-is girl. Every part of the sandwich is pure bliss. The ciabatta from Slow Dough Bread Co is so tasty it needs no assistance from other players, but the other ingredients just insist. The Green Goddess dressing is not intrusive at all and the pickled red onions are a lovely sharp accompaniment to the whole thing. The shrimp and blue crab don't hide. Local Foods is generous with their meat. You would swear that there is a hint of butter in there somewhere; that is what makes you close your eyes at the end of each bite, hoping the sandwich never ends.
