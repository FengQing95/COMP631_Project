The Pit Room////Overall, I loved the brisket and the atmosphere of the bbq joint and it comes close to my favorite spot! However, the free sides that most bbq places have..... this place was the best for that! ... an odd thing to enjoy, but I loved the pickled onions, even pickled green onions, jalape√±os, and other pickled veggies they offered. Best selection yet.
