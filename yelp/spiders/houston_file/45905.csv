Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Some of the pastries/cakes in the glass cases seem overpriced but I guess maybe they're all worth it?? Huge chunky cookies for $4 would be fine with me if I were really into huge chunky cookies I guess!! But really I'd say it's all worth if you're not on a tight budget!! Always great service, and the hot foods come out very promptly, so no complaints there either!
