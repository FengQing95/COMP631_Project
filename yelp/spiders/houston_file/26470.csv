The Pit Room////Great food. Good enough that I am writing this while I eating. I got the 2 meat combo. Brisket is fantastic and so is the venison sausage. A lot of bbq places I've been to have sausage more like store bought kalbosa. Here is sausage has an authentic spic and smoked crunch. Their sauce starts tangy and ends with some heat. Only here 3 more nights, so I will come back
