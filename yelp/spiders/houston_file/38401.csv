Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////They catered a party & all the guests really enjoyed the food! I went to the restaurant once & was looking for more healthy options, I settled on Mac n cheese. I'll go back one day & try again when I'm not trying to eat healthy or when I see a healthier option I'd like to try. I hear they have a great whiskey collection, I'd like to take my husband there to try them out!
