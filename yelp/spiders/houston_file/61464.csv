Baby Barnaby's////Super small yet cute place! The wait was about 10 mins for indoor dining not too bad. The staff and server were very friendly and welcoming. The food omg the food was delicious! I like the eggs and French toast the best. The eggs were scrambled perfectly and the French toast they used some kind of cinnamon swirl bread it was sweet and tasty. It was an overall good breakfast, will return.
