JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Dorian - Thank you for the great review! I'm very happy to know you took the leap and tried ramen, and am beyond pleased that you enjoyed what we have to offer. Please know for next time you can request a "Special Egg," which is a hard-boiled, seasoned egg -- which is not the traditional soft-boiled, custard yolk that we serve by default.
