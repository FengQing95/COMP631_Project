Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The staff was polite and very knowledgeable! I highly recommend the pig candy! The kimchi paired with the pig candy was nothing short of amazing! The cornbread and spread were delightful. The burger was full of flavor and was such a big portion my friend and I had to share. I cannot wait to try more from their menu and take a closer look at their beautiful whiskey room.
