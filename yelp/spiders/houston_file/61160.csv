Baby Barnaby's////This my go to breakfast spot! The spot I love so much, I get scared to share this gem! Sharing is caring, of course! I always ALWAYS get the green eggs but since I went pescatarian, I sub the chicken apple sausage for veggie sausage & still amazing! I'm very picky where I get my coffee but I love their coffee! & I especially love when we get to see Scott! He's amazing & gives the place a vibe!
