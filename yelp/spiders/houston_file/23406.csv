Uchi////In terms of dishes, try the 72 hour sous vide wagyu. You might be tempted to spring for something more traditional, but this beef is the best you could  ask for. It's topped with just the right amount of wasabi, and the rice underneath it is perfectly cooked to make the whole bite just melt in your mouth. Each piece isn't  cheap, but it's a dish you'll remember and want again for a long time to come. For me, that beef is guaranteed to bring me back to Uchi whenever I get the chance.
