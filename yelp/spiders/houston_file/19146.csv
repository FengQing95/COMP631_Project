Uchi////-not 2 SECONDS after approaching bar AREA bartender Dale reached out and handed us the drink menu. We didn't have to scoot between people at the bar and wait 5 minutes or more to be noticed--like usually happens everywhere else I've been. Yes he was busy with other people but was still AWARE of new patrons in area. I don't know why other bartenders elsewhere aren't the same but perhaps they just don't care.
