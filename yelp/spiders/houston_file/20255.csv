Uchi////A group of 5 of us were there for dinner last night. We were there from almost 7:30 to 10 and I must have eaten barely 5 pieces of sushi - ate mostly the Brussel sprouts because that's the only thing we had on the table - terribly slow service even after 9:30 pm. The person serving us would bring out one dish basically every 30 min with barely 3-4 pieces on the plate. We ended up cancelling most of the items we had pending and went home. The lady serving us made up some excuse about how she thought there were 2 of us eating one set of things and the rest eating another set..... Overall terrible service. It's almost as if it was our fault why the service was ridiculously slow. Had to go home and eat. Will have to wait a while before we go back.
