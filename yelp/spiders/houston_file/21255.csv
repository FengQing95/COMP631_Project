Uchi////asdlf;kjasdlfkjasdlfkjasdakjs I don't even know what to say about Uchi! I just went for the second time since moving to Houston back in June, and I'm just as blown away as I was after the first. I'll say that Uchi isn't exactly the traditional Japanese sushi joint in the sense of the menu, as everything is a bit gussied up with fancy herbs and marinades, though it's still hands-down some of the best sushi I've ever had. The fish itself is melt-in-your-mouth good and as authentic as it comes, just dressed up and made into unique, amazing dishes. I'm not even sure which is my favorite dish, since they're all so good, but really that's the thing...THEY ARE ALL SO GOOD! It doesn't even matter what you order!
