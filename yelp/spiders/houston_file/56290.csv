Kata Robata////Matcha cheesecake with red bean ice cream- this was on the specials, and the moment I laid eyes on it, I knew I had to have it. I LOVE green tea, cheesecake, and red bean, so it felt like the chef dreamed up this dessert just for me. I asked our server about it, and he described it as very green tea-y (as expected) and dry. Wait, what? DRY? "Tastes better when paired with the ice cream though." That should've been my cue to STAY AWAY, but goshdarnit I'm a stubborn girl and I know what flavors I like. I split it with my friend, and still had trouble finishing it. Not because it was big (it wasn't), but the dryness was really unbearable. There was also an overwhelming salty aftertaste. The red bean ice cream did help wash it down, but there was hardly enough on the plate. I hated it. I don't know why I still ate it. I have a problem.
