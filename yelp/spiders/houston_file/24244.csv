Uchi////We stopped by to get a late night meal, super helpful staff that tolerated my bfs love for chitchat very graciously :). 5 stars for service only as I feel as though I can't really speak to the food here after just coming back from japan. It's been a few years since I've last been to Uchi, and I remembered the food to be much more amazing than my most recent experience. It wasn't any worse than Japanese food in japan, so I think that at least says it's very authentic and is right on the money! I recommend getting the sake that comes in the boxes!! Always a fun experience :) also, I'd not recommend the ice fish.
