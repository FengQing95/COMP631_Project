Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a fantastic dinner at Bosscat tonight. Poutine, fried oysters, cornbread burgers and pasta was all delicious. Our server was fantastic, despite the fact that he is an Eagles fan and I am a lifelong Giants fan, I forgave him. Drinks were strong and fantastic, Â highly recommended!!
