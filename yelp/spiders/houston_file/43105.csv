Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////In general, I would not fight the parking or the crowd to come here just to eat the pastry.  Hopefully as this place gets less crowded (which I have now accepted as never), it will be a great studying or coffee place.  For now, it's just too much madness to come here for all right pastry.
