JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////As far as the amount of broth in our ramen bowls is concerned, our chefs use designated ladles to portion every bowl of ramen -- nothing is "eyeballed" or left to estimation. However, if you add more noodles or additional toppings, then the a certain amount of broth will often get absorbed into these toppings, which is why we always suggest ordering extra broth in these cases.
