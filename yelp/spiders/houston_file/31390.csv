Local Foods////Local Foods hits all the marks for me - great food, great staff, and it's close to work!  The seasonal menu means you're getting the freshest, most seasonal appropriate offerings and I haven't met one of their sides I don't like.  If you're ever stumped to make a decision when it's your turn at the cash register, everyone I've encountered is eager to help offer their favorite dishes to help you narrow things down.   It can get crowded at lunch and a little difficult to grab a table, but their bussers are quick to get things cleaned up for the next diners.  The portion sizes are great, and I always leave satisfied!
