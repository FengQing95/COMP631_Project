JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My family and I ordered the tempura brussel sprouts and caramelized cauliflower as appetizers. The tempura brussel sprouts were excellent and taste great with the gyoza sauce they have sitting at the table. The cauliflower however was incredibly disappointing. They're simply cooked pieces of cauliflower doused in lemon juice.
