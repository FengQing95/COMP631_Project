JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen came out in a reasonable amount of time. Not too fast but not waiting forever either. I didn't like the noodles too much. They were okay but nothing special. That's why this review is 4/5 starts. What was amazing though was the broth. The broth was so delicious and just the right level of spicy! It saved the ramen for me. I loved the broth so much that I killed the whole bowl. Â
