Kata Robata////Finally, dessert was "strawberry shortcake" and "warm banana cake." Understand that what arrived at our table was nothing like what we expected from those names, but that's OKAY. It was, instead, far better. The warm banana cake was the better of the two, served with amazing citrus ice cream (probably sorbet or gelato, but...whatever), some foam, and whatnot...we agreed that we could have eaten about five times what they served us, but I am glad someone was exercising some restraint on our behalf. I expected it to be somewhat overly sweet and heavy, but it was exactly the opposite, light and fresh and...again...surprising. The "strawberry shortcake" was also excellent but lacked the OH MY GOODNESS THAT WAS SO GOOD impact of the banana cake.
