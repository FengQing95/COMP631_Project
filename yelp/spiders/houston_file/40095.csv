Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We went for happy hour and had a couple of house old fashioneds - nothing special, but they hit the spot. We also had the portobello fries, which are almost a meal in themselves (get extra sauce), and the cornbread madeleines with the huckleberry sweet cream butter. The butter is the star, otherwise it's just something like jiffy corn muffins, but it is so, so worth it for the combination of the butter and the vehicle for the butter. We didn't order any food off the happy hour menu - it just didn't seem very exciting. We kind of timed it perfectly, because then at 6 p.m., steak night became available. We split one order. The steak was about average for a steak night, maybe a little better than most. The green beans and salad were good, but nothing amazing. The macaroni and cheese was not my thing. It tasted like buffalo sauce, like maybe a bunch of Frank's Red Hot. It just wasn't my thing for mac 'n cheese. Overally, I love Bosscat for its consistency, amazing appetizers, great specialty drinks, outstanding whisk(e)y list, and friendly service. The outside and "inside outside" seating is greatly appreciated during pandemic times as well.
