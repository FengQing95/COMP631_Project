Uchi////Hokkaido uni: this was my first time ever having uni and my goodness what an explosion of flavor it was. The uni was so incredibly fresh and it's flavors contrasted perfectly with the warm sushi risk wrapped with nutty crunch seaweed. Â $12 dollars for that one little bite, but I'd do it again!!
