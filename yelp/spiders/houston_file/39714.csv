Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////For the food, there's a lot of meat options. I don't eat pork or beef, so the menu seemed a bit limited to me. A friend of mine got the Cajun Chicken and that was delicious! I also tried my other friend's skillet pancake and it literally tasted like cake YUM! I got the turkey sandwich which was very creamy with the sauce on top. I couldn't finish it, so I wouldn't get it again.
