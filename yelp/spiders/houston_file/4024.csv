JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Britney - Thank you for your great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our fare. And to address your concerns regarding seafood-ramen options, we are a franchise concept based out of Los Angeles, so every item on our menu is decided by our corporate headquarters. I can tell you that their R&D department is constantly working on new menu items, so keep on the lookout for a possible seafood option down the line.
