Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Twas super hyped to check out this place, not just because of the numerous reviews and photos but also because it reminded me of my yelp days at home in CA. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but it wasn't extraordinary like I hoped to experience. The photos did more justice than the food itself all in all.
