The Pit Room////Been driving by this place for some time, this time stopped. SO Very Happy we did !  Barbecue was Top Notch.  This is in my Top 5 in Texas.  Pepper dry rub on beef rib was flavorful and just right. Chicken was smokey & moist.  Homemade beef sausage excellent without the salt or grease.
