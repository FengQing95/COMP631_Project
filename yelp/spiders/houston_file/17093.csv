JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My family and I love coming to this place! As a teacher, I love to treat myself to some ramen after a very long day. I usually like to come by during happy hour because I mean who wouldn't? The food is pretty good here and not too far from my home so it's my go-to ramen restaurant.
