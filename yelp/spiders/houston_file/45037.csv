Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is an exciting addition to the Westheimer brunch scene. With its chic LA feel and fancy foods, you'll feel like you're worlds away from regular ol' Houston. Given how often I come here I probably should be giving them five stars, but I just have a few things that nag at me, and for this price point I wouldn't expect that.
