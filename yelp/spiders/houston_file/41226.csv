Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We got a variety of things including croissants, pastries, and macarons. Â The pastries were awesome and the almond croissant was probably my favorite. Only complaint would be the price a little on the high side our bill was $40 just for breakfast for two people!!
