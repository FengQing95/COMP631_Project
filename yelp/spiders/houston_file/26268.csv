The Pit Room////I like the barbecue here a lot. It isn't quite as good as Killen's barbecue in Pearland, but it's still pretty good. The sausages are a little juicer and the cole slaw is sweet and delish! The desserts leave something to be desired; the banana one was mushy, but that's about the only bad thing I have to say about this place.
