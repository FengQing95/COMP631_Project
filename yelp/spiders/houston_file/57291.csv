Kata Robata////Came here on a Sunday night hoping to get some good sushi but everything we came for and wanted were out (uni, o-toro, etc). We ended up ordering some things off of their special menu and everything we had were just ok. We ordered clams in lobster sauce, scallop sushi, foie gras sushi, a salmon sashimi appetizer that I can't remember the name of, and two drinks. Nothing stood out. We didn't order much but our bill was still over $100 before tip. It wasn't worth it.
