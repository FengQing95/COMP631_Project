Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////What a fabulous new breakfast/brunch joint! I loved everything about it from the moment we walked in. The hostess' was friendly and quick to greet us- all the employees were super cheerful and seemed like they were having fun! Dancing while making coffee, smiling, and running around in capes.. What could be better? I'll tell you what.... The food!!!! Amazing. Hands down one of the best breakfast places in Houston. (Sorry baby barnabys-they passed you in my mind!)
