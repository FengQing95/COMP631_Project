Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was awesome and the service is Amazing! Our waitress, Roni, made our first visit a great experience. Her suggestions were on point! We ordered The breakfast pot pie was so good. We also ordered The Pancake flight- let me tell you... The Blueberry Danish Pancake is the best Pancake in the Universe! The pineapple upside Pancake & the Drunkin Monkey French Toast was absolutely delish! Love this place! Â We can't wait to go back and try the other wonderful menu items!
