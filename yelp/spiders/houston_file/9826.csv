JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Eunji - Thank you for your review. There's an old adage in the restaurant business that if you're not always evolving, you're dying. So we are grateful that our corporate headquarters (we are a franchise concept) is always coming up with new menu items and new ideas to try. Some work, some don't, but at the end of the day we are always moving forward.
