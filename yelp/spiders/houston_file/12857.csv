JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Price is expensive but standard for ramen. I really like the Brussel sprouts ramen and after trying Ramen Tatsuya, I prefer Jinya more. The ambiance is also comfortable. Cute little store! Parking was confusing until I realized you can park at the garage across the street for free!
