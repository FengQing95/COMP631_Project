Baby Barnaby's//// If you have the patience and want an excellent brunch,  I would suggest stopping by this place.  I was out of town so I thought why not get some local cuisine.  If you are native to Houston and have a weekday to spare, I would suggest going then so you can avoid the very long wait.
