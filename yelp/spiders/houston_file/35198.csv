Local Foods////Came here for a casual lunch and the food was absolutely delicious. I got the sandwich of the day which happened to be a lobster roll and I got it with a side of corn salad and potato salad. Everything including the bread was so good. It was definitely beyond my expectations. They are being extremely careful during the COVID phase. You are required to wear a mask to go inside the store to place your order and there is some patio seating available for you to dine there. Definitely the best spot for a casual meal in rice village.
