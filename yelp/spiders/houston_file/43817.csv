Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////When I visited the bakery, the first thing I noticed was the clean, simple, and industrial feel of the building. I enjoyed the ambiance and all of the natural lighting from the big windows very much! A team that is detail oriented with their building must be detailed with their baking, right?
