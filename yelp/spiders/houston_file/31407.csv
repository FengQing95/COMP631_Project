Local Foods////First time and impressed! I ordered the crunchy chicken on pretzel bread with 2 sides, homemade chips and quinoa.. Delicious! The mint-aide beverage was so refreshing too! Definitely must come back! Also the tunes playing were catchy and made the eating environment much more pleasing;)
