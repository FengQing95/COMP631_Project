The Pit Room////Lots of stars, high expectations, and it delivered! Top 2 of the best briskets I ever had. Melt in the mouth meat. Sausage had a good kick, and I got the medium hot. Good atmosphere too. Very Texas. We drove from close to IAH airport all the way down (since it was open until 9pm), and it was very worth the drive. My recommendation is the end of the brisket and the ribs. You're welcome.
