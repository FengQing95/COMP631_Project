JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is located proximal to the downtown area, and consequently parking can be tricky. You can park in the free garage on the same block, which is shared with other businesses and 24 Hour Fitness. If you don't see the garage at first, just circle the block until you spot an entrance. When I came around 5:30 PM on a Wednesday, parking spaces seemed full. However, people come and go fairly frequently so just circle around a bit, and I'm sure you can easily snag a spot.
