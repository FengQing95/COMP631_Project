Kata Robata////   A friend brought me here, and made me a fan within the first few minutes of being here.  We were immediately seated at the bar on a busy day, and the waiter was right there to get our drinks and appetizer.  Today was one of those days, I felt it was going to be an expensive l'inner (lunch/dinner? No?).
