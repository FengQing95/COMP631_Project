JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It's not the best ramen on the planet. Maybe not the best in Houston. But it's darn good and there are several winning bowls for regular customers. The price point is right. The dining room is fun with people sitting at communal tables. We enjoyed talking with our neighbors. Also space for a more intimate meal, though why one would choose ramen for intimacy is the real question. To maximize enjoyment, perfectly cooked noodles, and a burned mouth, there should be no talking while rapidly consuming the bowl. See David Chang for a more thorough rant. I thought the noodles were good and extra portions can be ordered on the side, which is nice. The broths are not too fatty for an American palate, but fatty enough to stick to the noodles. I think in the future I will come alone and sit at the bar where one can slurp in peace, with a cold draft, and some televisions. The bar is separate from the dining room, so there is no clashing of atmospheres and it's a good place to wait for a seat or the rest of your party.
