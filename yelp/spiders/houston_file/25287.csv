Uchi////We ordered machi cure, Wagyu hot rock, karaage, chef's 5 nigiri selection, gyutoro nigiri, avocado nigiri, and masu nigiri. Machi cure was a great blend of smoky and nutty flavors. The yellowtail was yummy. I was slightly disappointed in the hot rock because the meat wasn't super tender but it was a good experience. Karaage was good fried chicken but I don't think I'll order it again; it wasn't anything special. The nigiri was where it was at!! I've heard a lot of raves about the avocado and masu, and I'm glad I ordered both. My boyfriend hates avocado and any vegetables/fruit but he really enjoyed those items here. They were so soft and melt-in-your-mouth. The gyutoro is described as a 72-hour short rib. Also melted in our mouths, so good! The 5 piece nigiri selection was also very tasty. We ate it up so fast!
