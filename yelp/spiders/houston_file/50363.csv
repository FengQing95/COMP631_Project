Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Both times we had the combo of 2 types of eggs Benedict and a combo of pancakes and the omg French toast. I think these are their most popular items. The pancakes are yummy and don't even need syrup. That French toast is where it's at though. It's stuffed with mascarpone cream.
