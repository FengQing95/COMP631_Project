Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There was a few cakes on display, ready to buy. The cakes were beautifully decorated, one of them was a unicorn theme. Great choice for a birthday cake. They also serve lunch and dinner here with coffee and lattes. Water and utensils can be found by the windows. They have a good amount of tables to sit. Overall, I'm loving the baked goods and desserts here. An ideal place for breakfast or brunch.
