Kata Robata////Yes, it's pricey, which is the only reason I won't be coming here more often. This is not your go-to sushi place for whenever you're craving a spicy tuna roll. Â I have one of those places too, but Kata is where I'll go when I want to treat myself (or better yet, someone wants to treat me!!)
