Kata Robata////There's nothing like starting what should be a nice dinner off on the wrong foot. It really just sours the whole experience. I would consider going back maybe much earlier or later than the regular dinner rush, but I hope management gets some better training for the hostesses. Our servers both times were excellent and the busboys cleared our plates very promptly....please just fix your hostesses!
