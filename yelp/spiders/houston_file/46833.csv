Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Woke up late on a Wednesday morning and rolled up to Snooze with my man for a morning date.  We got there around 1030AM; the tiny parking lot in front of the restaurant was obviously already full.  But we easily found street side parking close by. We waited less than 10 minutes while we enjoyed the free coffee before we were seated.  I order the Chilaquiles Benedict with a Bloody Mary while my date ordered Havana Daydreaming. My eye opener was not memorable but I guess it was enough to kickstart my day.  Chilaquiles Benedict was absolutely delicious.  The poached egg yolk poured generously over the juicy barbacoa when I slices through the egg white . My side salad saved me from my guilt and cleansed my palate for between bites.  I usually have food envy as in the other person always has a better dish, but not this time.  I had some of the Havana Daydreaming; but I don't remember anything of it. I would definitely go back! Probably not on a weekend though.
