Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The bakery offers excellent baked goods. However, the line moves a bit slow. With too few registers (two), it makes the line out the doors needlessly. The decor is contemporary and casual. But with the line being so long, they need to consider adding another register to handle the long lines. Their skilled bakers are 2nd to none in Houston though.
