JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm no ramen affecionado, but this is the best I've had so far. Ordered the black tonka-something soup, asked for it spicy. It sure did have a kick to it, and very good flavor. They didn't skimp on the meat either. Will be going back. Got the pork bun as an appetizer but that was just a bao. I'd skip that and just get the ramen. Very filling and satisfying.
