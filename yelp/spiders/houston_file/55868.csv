Kata Robata////The food was, to me, just decent.  I didn't care for the foie gras scallops, which was the only thing that I insisted on.  However, I'd have to say that they had some kind of taco appetizer that was really good, and their grilled squid was really nice.  But neither of those were sushi.  I felt the sashimi pieces seemed smaller than I'd desired.  Everything was good, just not great.  I guess that's what happens when you have high expectations for a place.
