JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place is nice; dimly lit as if to be perfect for a date night. However, if you are there when they are busy, this place is less than romantic. The seating is split into three types: 2-person booths, 4-person tables, and large tables that they will sit people next to each other (like a hibachi restaurant). The place is fairly small and can get very loud during rush hours. Luckily I have always been sat at the booth, so not many complaints there.
