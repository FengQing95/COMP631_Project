Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast pot pie (4/5): yum!! Loved the flakiness of the pastry, paired with some delicious gravy. The only con was I probably had one sausage slice the size of a quarter. They skimped a bit here, so this dish could've definitely used more meat. Hash was smokin hot and crispy though, just the way I like it.
