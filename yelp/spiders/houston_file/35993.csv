Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////It was my first time at Bosscat and I have to tell you it was great!! The service from Terry and Jose (occasionally Theresa) was awesome. They told me the house favorites, the story of Bosscats and of course the bottomless mimosa deal (what really matters). Would recommend if you're visiting Houston and want some good food and vibes!! Â FYI there's no room for picky eaters here, the chef knows what he's doing so you have to trust the menu!!
