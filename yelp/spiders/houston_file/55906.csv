Kata Robata////Hidden in a strip mall this is a pretty good place.  Food was fresh and carefully prepared.  I sat at the sushi counter and watched intently as the chefs quickly and efficiently prepared dish after dish.  Still, they inquired how I liked my food and suggested an additional roll.  Straightened out the main course being delivered without the appetizer having arrived.  Pleasant dining area.  Not too noisey.  Free parking in front.  A bit expensive but not outrageous.  Particularly liked the Nagasaki ramen noodle dish.
