Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The best place for brunch I've ever been to. Everybody was extremely nice and friendly, and the food was fantastic. Even though the wait was "75-90 minutes" when we came in on a Sunday, it turned out to be closer to an hour and they stayed open past their posted hours so we could have food. A must!!!!
