Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So the big question - would I come back? I'm not all that sure. It was a good experience with good food, but I'm not sure the wait is worth it. It's definitely not worth it on the weekends, and I'm sure this place gets packed during lunch. I think the sweet spot is 9-10 am on weekdays, and unfortunately I'll probably be working.
