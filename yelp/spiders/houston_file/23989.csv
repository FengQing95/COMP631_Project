Uchi////I'd probably give them a 3 but they don't enforce mask wearing inside. The food was not great, just ok, and two courses of fish had a strong odor and taste of fish. the place was packed and not well distanced. I encountered two people walking around the restaurant as if a pandemic was not going on, no mask. In the restroom, a unmasked woman of low intelligence claimed she was "waiting for her lipstick to dry" so she had no mask on. Overall cheesy crowd and needs lot of improvement on the food. High prices. Our server was good.
