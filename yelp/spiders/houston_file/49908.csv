Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Breakfast food is the way to my heart.  There aren't many breakfast places that I can actually become a fan of or enjoy to eat at all the time but this place is like a 10 times better version of Denny's or IHOP.  There was such a big selection that it was hard to decide to order even when waiting for a table.  Literally took me 30 minutes to finally decide and then we were seated which worked out well for me.
