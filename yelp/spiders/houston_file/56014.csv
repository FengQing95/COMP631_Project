Kata Robata////This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in a city full of sushi restaurants. The atmosphere is upscale. Sushi is a bit expensive, but not over the top. They also have tasting menus and happy hour. Lot's of roll choices. Presentation is always beautiful and the rolls taste amazing. Service is always great and the servers know the menu items and can make recommendations. Can get a bit packed, so if you're coming during peak times should probably call ahead.
