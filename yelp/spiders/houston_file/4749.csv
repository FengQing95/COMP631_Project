JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Ray - Thanks for your review. I have spoken to the bar staff about this incident and on their behalf, I regret this incident happened. I can assure you it was not intentional, but a mistake is still a mistake and we will work harder to prevent this from happening in the future. That said, when our foyer does get too crowded, many guests will prefer to wait at Piola or on the sidewalk. Most importantly, I am pleased you enjoyed your meal and that our servers took care of you and your party adequately.
