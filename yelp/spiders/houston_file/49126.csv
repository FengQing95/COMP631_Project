Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came to Snooze for the first time with friends on a Sunday around 8 A.M. in the morning. There was a wait time of approximately 30 minutes in line and another 15 minutes after being seated. They seemed to be short on waitstaff, but our waitress was very sweet and even provided us complimentary pancakes for the wait (Blueberry Danish).
