Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After my first experience which I have already posted about, I went back to check them out again. My biggest take-away from going back was this, everyone deserves a second chance. All of us have our bad days or off days. For whatever reason my fist experience was not a good one, but this time I was blown away. From the time we sat down our server Jen was super attentive and professional. We got our drinks and cocktails within 3 minutes of sitting down. We got an appetizer for the table, and let me tell ya, the pork belly poutine is a must. Appetizer was on the table in 10 minutes of being seated. Main course was put in at the time we received our appetizer and 20 minutes or so later we had our whiskey barrel steaks. Perfectly medium rare and packed with flavor. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Overall, I had a night and day experience and I will for sure be back. If you have a bad experience here, it's a fluke. Try them again and I'm sure they'll change your mind. Also, ask for Jen, she is an amazing server!
