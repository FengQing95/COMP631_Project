Baby Barnaby's////Overall impression was not too bad.  There was a line which was to be expected but the crowd was pleasant and it was not too rainy.  The only down side was that they offered coffee but there was either a lack of cups or coffee so it was not great.  Once inside it was a small place, and they sat me in a booth.  Down side, the fans going full blast on a day when it was cold and rainy out.
