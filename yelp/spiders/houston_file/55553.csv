Kata Robata////Dessert- now this is where I'm completely baffled. I cannot for the life of me understand why they call the green tea cake with red bean ice cream "green tea souffl√© cheesecake"??? It makes absolutely no sense at all. Do they know the definition of these foods? It's just crazy. Call the dessert what it is and set appropriate expectations. Just silly.
