The Pit Room////The Pit Room is fantastic! I love their tacos (both the brisket and chicken) and queso and their BBQ is delicious. The elote (they only have it when it is in season) is really good too. I still need to try their mac and cheese, but it looks amazing. It's also pretty decently priced too. We ordered a drink, the two taco dinner with chips and queso and a side of sausage which fed two people easily (huge portions) and it was only $21. Also, a great perk is the homemade salsa and pickled veggies that you can put on the side. The Pit Room is a must try!
