Kata Robata////We ended with the Chef's Sashimi for two. It was pretty good, and had a large amount of sushi on there. So much that I actually found myself wanting to be done with it by the end... I needed a new taste in my mouth, haha. If I did it again, I would have ordered separate nigiri/sashimi items off the menu and gotten a roll to break up the taste of the sashimi.
