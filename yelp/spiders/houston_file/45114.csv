Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We eventually moved to a seat in front of the window overlooking busy people-watching and finally took a bite of the chocolate croissant. Mm... pretty good. Nothing spectacular. Then we took a bite of the roll. A little dry, but okay... Well, it's a little underwhelming. And it was pretty expensive. I was hoping it'd be to the likes of Tartine in SF, but I guess my expectations were too high.
