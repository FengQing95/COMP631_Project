Uchi////Moving on to the Sushi portion of our night. If you are already at this restaurant, please give it a try to eat some raw fish. Don't be like everyone sitting around us who ordered 7 rolls between two people. This restaurant has excellent sushi chefs who understand a good cut of fish, how to approach the flavor correctly, and how to create a new spin on the typical taste. I would recommend ordering off of the select menu which lists the freshest fish, and newest options. By doing so, we paid a few dollars more, but had a far more satisfying meal.
