Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hello, Houston: we have a new brunch spot!!!! Snooze is awesome. I went for the soft opening and tried several items off the menu. First and foremost: have the pancake of the day. Do it! Mine was a buttermilk carrot pancake with a curry vanilla drizzle topped with toasted coconut and basil. Eureka!!! It was amazing. I also had the Double Benny, which gives you the option to have 2 types of Eggs Benedict. I had the original and the Benny Verde (Mexican version). Yes. Do it! I was concerned about the Mexican Benny, but it was delicious! I also had a standard mimosa (Mmm Mmm Mimosa), which was good and substantial. My wife had the Mayan Mocha, an adult coffee beverage (iced), which was delicious! She had the Sandwich I Am sandwich, which was great--she added avocado and had it with black beans on the side (refried).
