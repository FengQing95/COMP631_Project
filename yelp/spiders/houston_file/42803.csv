Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The kugelhopf is the stuff dreams are made of. The biscuits and gravy are the stuff some of my other, better dreams are made of. The chocolate tart is the stuff of those dreams that are so intense that they are pretty much nightmares. And I've killed at least two but less than four people for just a little taste of the cookies they bake here.
