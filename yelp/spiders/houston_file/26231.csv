The Pit Room////This is certainly some of the best barbecues in Houston, for a good price. Cleanly facility & lots of menu options that expand upon the typical barbecue joint choices. The brisket tacos are amazing! They have received awards for their Mac and cheese- and it's easy to believe once you taste it. They serve venison sausage that is very good & the sweet tea is Texas style. Cafeteria style. Yo go through a line to pick food and pay for it at the end of the line. Then, good luck finding a spot because this place is always packed when I go!
