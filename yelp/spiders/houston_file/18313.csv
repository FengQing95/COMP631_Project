Uchi////We had dinner at Uchi on our anniversary. My wife surprised me with the reservation. I love Japanese food and usually get my fix when traveling to Sao Paulo for work since my wife doesn't really enjoy sushi. Uchi lived up to its billing and the entire experience was amazing. The food was great and creative. Both the wife and I loved everything we tried.
