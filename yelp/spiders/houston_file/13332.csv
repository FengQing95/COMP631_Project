JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Queen - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. We greatly appreciate it. I'm glad you received great service during your visit, and I'm also glad you enjoyed our fare. To be fair, not all of our patrons are into our dining atmosphere when we are full (ie. "young," vibrant" and "very loud"). So it's always refreshing to get feedback from folks who sort of "get" what we're going for in our business. Thank you again, and we hope to serve you again soon.
