JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I just love this place. The ramen is very delicious.  The atmosphere is fun and upbeat.  If you've never had ramen, they will explain the entire thing to you so that you understand what to order to best suit your tastes.  You also get to customize it, so that it's just how you want your soup. It's very worth making this place a common stop.  Hands down, delicious and fun!
