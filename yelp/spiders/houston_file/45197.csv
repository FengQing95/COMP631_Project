Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////today, i went and am extremely disheartened and honestly view them a little differently now which is why i docked them 2 stars. there is a sign requesting masks be worn inside, clearly visible at the entrances. there are still other patrons disregarding this with no management enforcing this basic level of hygiene at this time. this puts customers and employees in extreme danger. each and everyone has a family that doesn't want them sick and/or dead. the complete disregard for people's lives under a pandemic is inexcusable and irresponsible. the least you can do as management is ask people to cover their mouths right now, especially if there's already a sign in place @ the entrances. I won't be coming back here while COVID-19 runs rampant and money-hungry businesses put profit over lives. clearly, you are at risk of contracting COVID-19 here and i highly suggest you do not come in. order to-go curbside and save yourself and your loved ones if necessary.
