Uchi////machi cure (4/5)- yellowtail, fried yucca, almonds, pear. this dish also embodied unique textures and flavorings. it had a satisfying sweet/salty/soft/crunchy element. i loved the fact that even though there were many ingredients in this dish, none of them overpowered the other, and everything worked well together.
