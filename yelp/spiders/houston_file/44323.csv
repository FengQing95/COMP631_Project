Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As a lover of all things carb and butter, I cannot get enough of Common Bond. It's not about the fedora-ed servers behind the counter, the aesthetically pleasing boxes, or even the light-filled, airy interior (although those things are all very nice). It's all about the gigantic, buttery, crispy-on-the-outside-but-soft-on-the-inside croissant (especially the almond croissant).
