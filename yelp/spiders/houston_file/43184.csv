Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////**EDIT** I wanted to edit my original review for Common Bond instead of updating it since the restaurant management promptly responded to my original post and explained that the new no-dog policy was not by their choice. It is actually the result of a city ordinance regarding sanitation of the restaurant, which I can understand. I appreciate the response and the restaurant's continuing effort to make its customers happy.
