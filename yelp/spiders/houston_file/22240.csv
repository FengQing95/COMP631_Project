Uchi////A few notes - new head sushi chef.  Apparently he's the real deal.  Before Uchi got by on its swag and creative and tasty dishes such as the Brussel Sprouts and Walu Walu.  The new chef is probably from Japan, because the fish is so much fresher, changes daily, and is very serious.  Now you can get Hokkaido uni (like butter!), fresh akimo (foie gras of Japan), so many fish and still freshly grated wasabi!   Yum!
