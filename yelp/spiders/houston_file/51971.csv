Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had high expectations, but unfortunately the food here fell quite short. Our server was doing his best, but he had way too many tables and just couldn't keep up. We heard folks from multiple tables around us whose orders were incorrect. We got what we ordered, but it took over 30 min from the time we ordered. And then it was just meh at best.
