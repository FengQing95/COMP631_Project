Uchi////We order around 12 dishes, so I'm just going to point out a few favorites. From the happy hour, we ordered the machi cure and buta abura kasu. Both were excellent and unique. I especially enjoyed the pork in the kasu. From the permanent menu, we got the hot rock, shrimp and pumpkin tempura, and the chef's five pieces of sushi. The beef with the hot rock was wonderful and tender, and it was fun to get to cook the beef on the rock. Both tempura pieces were wonderful, but my favorite had to be the pumpkin. The five pieces of sushi were one of my favorite parts of the meal. Each sushi piece was lightly garnished, but it really made each piece stand out.
