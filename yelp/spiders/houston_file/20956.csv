Uchi////After reading several Yelp reviews, we had a general idea of what to order, but we had also intended to lean on our server's recommendations on what was featured that day, though he really didn't offer many when prompted. He mostly just confirmed what other Yelpers had stated and we ended up ordering exclusively from the everyday menu. We tried the hama chili, the walu walu, brussels sprouts, mustang roll, zero sen roll, ham & eggs roll, foie nigiri and the fried milk. Each dish was served by a different server/runner, who explained the elements of the dish and suggested the best way for us to attack it. We enjoyed everything we tried but the highlights were the hama chili, walu walu and the foie nigiri. The ham & eggs roll was a nice surprise, too, considering we were feeling iffy about ordering that one. The Brussels sprouts were really good, especially for my husband who is Brussels sprout-averse, but they really served as filler for us since we otherwise would have left a tad on the hungry side. The fried milk was interesting and the presentation was beautiful, but I was a bit underwhelmed, probably because I had over-hyped it in my mind.
