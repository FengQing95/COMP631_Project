Uchi////sushi selections (4/5)- uni, salmon belly, scallops, unagi - everything was very fresh! im usually not a huge fan of uni, but this was actually tolerable- very sweet and nutty. Â salmon belly- it was good, but I wish they could have selected a fattier piece. I've been to a few places, where the salmon is so fatty, that there's a sheen from the natural fish oils.
