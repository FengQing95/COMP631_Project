Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I think this place is a bit overrated. The estimated wait time they gave us at 1230pm on a Tuesday was 45 min but we waited an hr and half. The food was okay but we had to wait another 30min before we got it :( parking is hard to get in that small lot, so we parked blocks away.
