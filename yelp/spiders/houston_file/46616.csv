Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is a great place to order a treat, grab a hot or cold beverage, and people watch others making their orders. They also have these beautiful whimsical cakes on display in different sizes. I've always wanted to order one for a loved one's birthday but I don't want to be disappointed or embarrassed if they're not good and I have a feeling that they may be mediocre.
