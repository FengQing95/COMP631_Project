JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've been praying for good ramen like Jinya's! Before Jinya came around, I've been going to Tiger Den.... it's good - but they're not the traditional ramen like Jinya. I know there are different provinces in Japan where they have different types of ramen, but Jinya's definitely hits the spot for me!
