Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love Common Bond. I typically go sit here and work for a few hours since they have wifi and really good coffee and breakfast. I love their lattes and soft scramble. It's delicious. They also have several pastry options. The ambiance is very nice inside as well. Everything is very bright!
