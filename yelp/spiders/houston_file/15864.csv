JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My boyfriend and I visited Houston, and we missed Jinya ramen. We went there a few days ago and got seated right away. We were surprised by how close each table was to each other. Jinya does not follow the Covid Guidelines. We understand that the Covid affects a lot of business, and business is eager to make some profit to survive. However, putting all the tables so close to each other is putting all of the customers at risk. It made us feel very comfortable. I hope the management reads this review and makes some changes to their Covid Guidelines to keep all of their customers safe.
