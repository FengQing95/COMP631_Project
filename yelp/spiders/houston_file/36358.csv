Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was very good. Pricey but tasty. Paid 17$ for my burger.... No sides . But this thing was huge. Atmosphere is great. Stunning decor all around. Very clean and well kept. Would definitely recommend if looking for a nice date night spot. Just be ready to spend some extra $$$
