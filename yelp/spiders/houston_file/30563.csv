The Pit Room////I flew from Washington State to try this place. The food was what you expected it to be. The taco briskets were delicious, however the cheese over powered the flavor from the brisket. The Mac and cheese was amazing, super cheesy. The cheso dip was really good. If your visiting the area, this is a great place to go!
