Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We were immediately seated and ordered drinks and food within a reasonable amount of time, but there were a bit of a wait until we actually got our food (maybe 20-30 min? which wasn't horrible judging from what other people have waited). It was definitely hard to choose what to eat. I'm a big sweet + savory person and being post night shift was about to pull a crazy and order two entrees but I tempered myself and stuck with the plate that would give me the most variety for the least cost: the Benny Duo. If you're like me and literally want to order everything for breakfast, the Benny Duo ($12) is the dish for you. At $1 more, you get to choose 2 different eggs benedict with a side of hash browns. I opted for the Bella Bella (prosciutto, arugula, and balsamic vinaigrette) and the Benny Goodman (lox, cream cheese cream cheese, caper relish). Holy. Moly. I've never had such good eggs benedict in my life. The eggs were perfectly poached, the ingredient combos were perfectly complementary and not too heavy, and the cream cheese hollandaise sauce on both was to die for. I loved how the carb each benedict came with was super crispy (it's such a bummer to get a soggy muffin) and how all the ingredients were so fresh. The hash browns were aight; I'm partial to well done fried potato hash so I can't fault them for a signature dish.
