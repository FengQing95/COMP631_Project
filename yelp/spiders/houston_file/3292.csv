JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were quickly seated, waiters were friendly and quick. We had the gyoza for appetizer, which was pretty good, wish the price was a little lower, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. For the meal, I ordered the tonkatsu black and spicy. The spice level was right in the middle, which was perfect. I prefer to have a ramen with a bit of spice but not to a point where I am sweating and crying. The broth was creamy but not too heavy. The pork was very soft and almost melted in my mouth! They also gave a WHOLE egg! I was very happy with that and the egg was cooked to perfection (a bit runny, which is what I always look for at traditional ramen places). The portions were great, and I was stuffed towards the end.
