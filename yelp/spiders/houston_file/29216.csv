The Pit Room////A weird thing happened during our dining experience at The Pit Room. We ordered ribs, brisket, sausage, and chicken, and were eating, when one of the staff came over with a new order of ribs, explaining that the ones we were originally served we not fresh enough.  He was right.  The first batch were dried out and overcooked.  The replacement ribs had much better flavor.  Kudos to the staff for making the adjustment!
