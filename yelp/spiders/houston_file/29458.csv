The Pit Room////Overall good place for bbq. When you walk in, you notice that the ambience is a great combo of bbq feel but also a clean, modern vibe. You order at the counter and seating is first come first serve. The service is fast and friendly. Overall I thought the ordering process was efficient. The sauce and veggie bar is very good with a variety of pickled goods, jalape√±os (fresh and pickled) and sauces. We ordered the brisket, pork ribs, turkey, Mac n cheese and green beans. The green beans and the turkey hit it out of the ball park. Deliciously moist and flavorful without too much butter. The brisket and ribs were a bit dry and my only complaint about it, otherwise the rub and char is great.
