The Pit Room////My son and I did a 10 day road trip of Texas from North Carolina and this was hands down THE BEST meal we had. We arrived pretty early for lunch- around 11:15 and had no wait at all. We ordered a 2 meat combo and one of each taco. Everything was amazing. The brisket was butter- melted in your mouth. The elote was a highlight as well. It was so much food, we took about half with us and ate it for dinner. You MUST visit The Pit Room if you are ever in Houston.
