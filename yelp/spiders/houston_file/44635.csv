Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Although parking was limited, our overall experience was enjoyable! We got the chocolate croissant, ham and cheese scone, and three macarons (tiramisu, blue cheese & honey, and mango coconut) which were all very delicious! One thing to note though is that they're a bit pricier than your average bakery/pastry shop. Expect your pastries to range from ~$3-7 each and macarons $2.50 each. There's plenty of seating both inside and out on the deck, and it seems like a wonderful place to get some work or studying done. Not too quiet, not too loud with a lot of natural light coming through the windows. Looking forward to my next visit to try their beverages and food!
