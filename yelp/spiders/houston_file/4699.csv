JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Cha cha cha! My favorite ramen of all time, Jinya was the first place I came to for ramen. I never had Ramen before in my life. I tried number 1 it wasn't my favorite bc it wasn't buttery enough for my taste. But pleaseeee try number 3 it's soooooo good. OMG! Btw the price here are little bit more pricier than other places. But the Ramen are so worth it.
