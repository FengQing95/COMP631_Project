JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen here okay priced ($15-20 per person). I've had better ramen in SoCal for half the price. If you expect authentic Ramen coming to JINYA, you're bound to be sorely disappointed. There's MSG in the broth, lots of fusion (which I'm fine with), and the Ramen lacks the chewiness and perfection in texture that Japan is famous for.
