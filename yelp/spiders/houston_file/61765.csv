Baby Barnaby's////Wonderful experience and FANTASTIC FOOD. Small location, but worth the wait. I am really happy that we made a switch from our usual breakfast spot. My hubby said the fresh squeezed OJ was " worth the price of admission". No cost of admission, but he'd have paid it because it is FRESH!! Take a moment to discover this great neighborhood gem. Â The host is fab and knows everyone by name. That's the ambiance that will keep me coming back. When traveling to HOU this will be a stop!!
