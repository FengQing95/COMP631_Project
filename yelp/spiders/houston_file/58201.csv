Kata Robata////We started with the Ocean Picante roll, perfect starter being light, flavorful with a hint of spice from the jalepenos. Next came out the Mixed Ceviche & the Big Eye Tuna Poke, which I would say was our favorites of the meal. Even our next portion was good & extraordinary, the shrimp tempura. These next two meals were our endings: the the Miso Encrusted Bone Marrow (very good) and Kobe Beef skewers (100% must have). I'm actually curious on what isn't good here... Â
