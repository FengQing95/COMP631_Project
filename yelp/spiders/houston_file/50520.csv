Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We both ordered some eggs benedict. I odered the Bella! Bella! Benny and the Benny Goodman. They were both so good--the eggs were perfect! The salmon on the Benny Goodman was the best I've had in a long time. We also shared a pancake flight! We got the Peanut Butter Cup, Chocolate Chip, and Lemon Poppyseed. They were all delicious--though the lemon was a little too tart for my, my girlfriend loved it.
