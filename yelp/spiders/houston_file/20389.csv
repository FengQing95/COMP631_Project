Uchi////Service is amazing. From the hostesses to the chefs to all the servers and food runners that take turns bringing our dishes and describing them to us. If it's your first time there, the servers do an amazing job with breaking you in and explaining the best way to go about making the most of your experience. Being a training manager, there's nothing more I love than well-trained staff! I (and everyone I come with) always leave with happy hearts and bellies!
