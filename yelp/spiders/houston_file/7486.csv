JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went here for the first time today and it was amaaaaaazing! Pretty busy for a Monday night too. The overall vibe is awesome and the music is pretty chill. I got the edemame and poured the gyoza sauce on top of it which was conveniently placed next to me (: the ramen took a little bit of time to come out but that's expected with how busy it was. My friend asked for a seasoned egg with his ramen, and it came out fully cooked instead of yolky but that's just a preference thing.
