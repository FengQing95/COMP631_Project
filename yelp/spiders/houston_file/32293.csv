Local Foods////The menu offers sandwiches, salads and sides.  I had a spiced pork sandwich that was out of this world (unfortunately I can't remember the name).  My wife had the 'banh mi', which was their fabulous take on the traditional Vietnamese meatball sandwich.  We tried sides of the quinoa and zucchini salad and an orzo salad.  Both were refreshing and flavorful.  My wife had a cup of the posole soup which was perfectly delicious.
