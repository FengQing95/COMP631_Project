Baby Barnaby's////I consider the following items when rating restaurants that I try for the first time: facility/location, restrooms, staff, and food. I took off one star because our waitress did not provide the level of service we typically see elsewhere. We had breakfast here on a weekday morning, and there was plenty of available seating in this tiny restaurant. I ordered the green eggs, and they were delicious. The breakfast portion was big with sausage, potatoes, and toast. The restaurant was clean including the bathroom. Our server seemed more interested in side work than actually conversing with customers though.
