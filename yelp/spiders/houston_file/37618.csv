Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This is the best new place in the new Houston I've been to. José was an amazing server. Very friendly, nice and even gave us a tour. The vibe is friendly and kinda cluby but definitely our style. It was so good we texted all our friends that they should definitely come here. Oh and the whiskey selection.... omg will definitely be back. Thanks José
