Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It an open and modern coffee shop with lots of charm, music, seating, and a gorgeous display of their baked goods and their operations. I love it when places know what they are good and put it on display. Their menu is on TVs, and is very easy to read and modern. We inhaled their baked goods, which were made fresh. They don't wrap them or keep them hidden away, they are all fresh and only behind glass shields. I would say that it's more about the pastries, than the coffee, though! The coffee was okay. I had a brewed coffee, but they do offer some non-dairy options. My boyfriend had a latte, which he liked, but nothing about their coffee seemed over the top. They also had bread and pastries to-go, but really expensive. Overall, I would definitely go back, but probably more to eat with my boyfriend or with friends!
