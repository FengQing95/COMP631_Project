Uchi////I'm not sure if my boyfriend regrets giving me the choice to pick the location of my birthday dinner, or loves me even more for it.  I knew immediately that I wanted to try Uchi, so when he asked me where I wanted to go, I jumped at the chance to try it.  Looking back, I probably should have warned him about the "$$$$" classification, but why risk it?
