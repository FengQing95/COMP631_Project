JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Decent service for being packed on a Saturday night. A very socialized environment which is pretty cool. The menu is easy to read and too choose from. If you enjoy noodles check this place out plus if you finish your bowl and leave the broth they will refill it with noodles if youd like. So many choices I will be back Soon! A must try if you want authentic. You should definitely try the jinya bun.
