Uchi////Fried milk - 100000000/10 I honestly don't even have any words to describe this dessert because it's probably the best thing I've ever put in my mouth, EVERRRRRRR. Seriously this dessert was PHENOMENAL and full of so many different textures. If I had to choose a dessert for my last meal on earth, this would hands down be the one.
