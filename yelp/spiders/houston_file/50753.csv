Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////- We also got the Benny Duo, which was fun because we got to try two different benedicts! Another great idea. We got the Chile Verde Benedict, and the Habanero Pork Belly Benedict. We liked the Habanero Pork Belly Benedict better because it had a little kick and the pork belly was well cooked.
