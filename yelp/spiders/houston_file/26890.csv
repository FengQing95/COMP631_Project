The Pit Room////The pit room is your fuss free neighborhood bbq place. But that doesn't take away from the great quality and service. We had the brisket, ribs and chicken. By the time we started with the ribs they turned cold so we went to the counter to ask if they could reheat them. To our pleasant surprise they changed the whole set of ribs! That's great service and you know this place takes their meat seriously! The okra was amazing. I'm yet to find that tastily done okra. Definitely worth the money and a must visit if you're a meat lover. We're going back for sure
