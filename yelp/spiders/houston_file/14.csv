Kata Robata////one of my FAVORITE sushi places in the greater houston area.  the happy hour menu is great!  they have $4 rolls (i.e. california, spicy tuna etc).  not your typical rolls since the fish is extremely fresh.  we also had the foie gras scallop, tropical spicy tuna roll, and the tuna tar tar.  They are the greatest dishes i've ever tried anywhere.  the foie gras is such a great concept that you won't regret trying and the tuna tar tar is perfect since it comes with lotus chips that are characteristic only to kata.  love it!!
