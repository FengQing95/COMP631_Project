Local Foods////I really like Local Foods. It has such a laid-back vibe. My favorite thing on the menu is the crunchy chicken sandwich. Every now and then I'll switch it up and get it on a baguette instead of the regular pretzel roll. There are two locations - the one in Rice Village and the one in Upper Kirby. Personally, I prefer the one in Upper Kirby because they have much more outdoor seating with a really cute outside area. PLUS, they have the frozen version of their mintade, the best drink in the entire world. Not too sweet, not too bland, it's the most refreshing drink of the day. I wish they would change their menu up, or make it a little bigger with more options.
