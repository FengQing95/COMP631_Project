Kata Robata////I really like the food but if you're going for an early lunch, they open at 11:30 and they make you wait outside until they open. Now anyone that lives here in Houston knows it is miserably hot in July, so not really sure I will be back for an early lunch. It's kinda strange they can't allow patrons to wait in the foyer.
