JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We have not changed our portions since our grand opening in March 2015. In fact, as a franchise concept we have very strict recipes and measurements that we must follow in order for all of our menu items to look and taste according to corporate standards. Most importantly, our ramen chefs use a specifc 2-1/2 cup ladle to distribute our broths into our ceramic ramen bowls -- nothing gets "eyeballed."
