Kata Robata////Service:  5 stars.  Toddler friendly.  As we sat down, immediately, the server asked if he should bring something out for the hungry little one.  Great idea.  The other day, I gave them feedback about the freshness of an item.  The flavor was off.  You know, like the way wine can be slightly off when going bad but still drinkable because it's not totally vinegar yet.  "Off", as in I've ate enough of it for so long (because it is my favorite) so I know how it's supposed to taste.  I insisted on paying for the dish (since I ate it anyway; I was hungry.  And it's sushi, so it's bite size and it wasn't "off" enough to spit it out).  The manager absolutely insisted on taking it off the bill.  This went back and forth -- he won.
