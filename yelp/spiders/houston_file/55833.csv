Kata Robata////So...  we went there last Sunday finally, on a double date.  Though one of our dining partners was quite irascible (and he shall remain nameless of course!) our waitress handled everything very well throughout the meal.  I wish I had gotten her name - very cute and young with a headband and she served us 4 at the triangular table on the corner by the sushi bar.
