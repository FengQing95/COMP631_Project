JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Midtown--where all the fun starts and ends. Unlike a lot of places in midtown, the restaurant provides free garage parking! Whoot whoot. Also, right around the corner you can walk over to Wooster's Garden for some yummy cocktails or a night cap if you please. I have no complaints about the location.
