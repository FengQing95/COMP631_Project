JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Onto the food, the takoyaki was hands down the best thing I've had all week; it was crunchy on the outside and soft and steamy on the inside. I loved the potato salad like mash that the balls sat on top of and how generous the portion size was. Unfortunately, the spicy tonkotsu ramen I ordered was not as rich and flavorful as I hoped it would be; although it definitely packed a punch with the heat! For dessert, I had the panna cotta; this may have been the most unappetizing panna cotta I've ever seen in my life. I really hope the caramel wasn't actually made by a real person because that poor caramel had the texture of sandpaper and looked like the poop emoji. I tried my best to eat the entire thing because I didn't want to offend the dessert but in the end I just couldn't.
