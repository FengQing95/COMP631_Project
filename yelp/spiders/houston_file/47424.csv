Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday morning, arriving at about 10:00am. We ran into some friends and in total had a table for 5. Our friends were there maybe 15 minutes before us, and were told an hour to an hour and 15 minute wait, not enough to turn us off. So we waited it out. What's unfortunate was while this was the only horrible experience we really had, it made it the entire experience to takeaway.
