Kata Robata////I see people comparing Kata Robata to Uchi, I really don't think they should be compared. I love them both pretty equally. The aged kobe skewers are a must and the Rising sun and the Salmon Tar Tar rolls were so delicious and flavorful it felt wrong! Our whole table loved every bit of our meal including the aaaahhhmmmazzing Creme Brulee!
