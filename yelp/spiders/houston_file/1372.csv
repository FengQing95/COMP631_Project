JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was good. I grew up in Alief, lived in NY and Hawai'i and not of Asian descent but have had better. Â This is a typical spin for the liking of a city kid who hasn't spent time in a cultural area. Good but not WOW! Do I recommend, yes, of course, everyone should try and have their own opinion and again, it was not bad, just nothing to come back to.
