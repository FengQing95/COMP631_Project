JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The shot glasses, along with all of our bar glasses, are placed in the light-green plastic dishwasher racks and run through the bar dishwasher on a 60-second cycle. But just as you mentioned with the extended wait times, we serve several hundred guests per hour, so we tend to get rushed during peak business hours, and while our dishwasher isn't a perfect machine, it is an industry-standard model you will find in just about every restaurant in town, if not the entire nation.
