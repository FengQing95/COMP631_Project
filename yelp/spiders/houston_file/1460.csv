JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have tried many ramen bars, but so far this one has got to be my favorite. They have many different ramen options, and they also have other foods if you aren't a ramen fan. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I usually order the spicy chicken ramen and it is too good! Only downside is that they are usually very busy and have a wait. But once you get seated, the food comes pretty fast. Jinya has a nice atmosphere but is typically rather loud. Overall, a great choice!
