Local Foods////Excellent food made with quality ingredients. Great to-go for a picnic! We don't recommend the potato chips, but with so many other wonderful sides, it doesn't really matter. The Bahn Mi, Cous Cous, Crunchy Chicken, Cucumber, and Tuscan Kale were all stellar. We will definitely go back...and back, and back...
