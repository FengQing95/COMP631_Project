The Pit Room////Super boombastic oober fantastic...this place is authentic, all the sides are made in house, meat is off the charts and their location is perfect! THE best BBQ in Houston...period!! The pork ribs are my favorite followed closely by their brisket and then beef rib. Their tortillas are off the charts, I recommend wrapping them around any of their meat and plopping some sides on top to make your own unique taco...I top my taco off with copious amounts of their queso...I could literally drink that stuff!!
