Uchi////Lots and lots of flavors, we got the 6 serving tasting and it was great.  People have raved about the fried milk, I thought it was good but was thrown by the brown oat stuff that was on it, seems to dry it out for me.  The price is reasonable and expect to wait a while for your table because this is a very popular spot.
