Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////However not all of their desserts are on sale- the tarts, macarons, and cakes are still full price. Previously when I had gotten the cakes and macarons, I thought the cake was a little too sweet and the macarons were ok for their price. Their pastries are really where the good stuff is in my opinion.
