Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have tried so many pastries and have never been disappointed by any!! Desserts are not overwhelmingly sweet and balance flavors so well! Even when the lines are long they get your food out pretty quick. My only critic would be the pricing, but one must also remember you're paying for the location and decor. A small mini cheesecake cost me a whopping 8$, but was definitely delicious!
