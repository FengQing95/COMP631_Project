The Pit Room////The line was crazy but the wait was worth it!! The meat was so tender and  full of flavor. It was my husband and I's first time there and the cook was really nice and patient with us. He even spoke Spanish!  They also had an amazing variety of beers and overall we had a great time. The staff was really attentive and funny. Everyone just seemed to have a great time despite how constantly busy it was. Highly recommend this place if you really want to get a bang for your buck!
