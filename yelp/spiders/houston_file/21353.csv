Uchi////I was traveling in Houston this week and had to spend the weekend so decided to go to this restaurant. I really highly recommend this to anybody if you like any kind of sushi or fusion type, you cannot go wrong. I had the crispy brussel sprouts the Walu Walu the Zero Sen, the Foie Gras, and the hamachi, there was not one bite that I regretted, finished it all off with fried milk. The place was hopping and I was lucky to walk in at 7:30 and sit at the bar. Bartender was awesome and really knew his stuff..
