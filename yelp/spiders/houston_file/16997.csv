JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious! Kids loved the chicken ramen, but it was too big of a serving for them (8 & 9). Two small kids can share one serving, but one serving was not enough for me. Order some sides or add an egg if you want to be full! Loved the broth here. Great service and the food came out quick.
