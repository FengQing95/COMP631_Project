Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the poutine, which was delicious! It came out in a skillet and the fries were rustic thick cut fries that were super crispy! They still had a crunch under all of the melted cheese curds and this phenomenal sauce/ gravy on top. Then we ordered the corn bread Madeline's which were also to die for. Super soft and delicate and not gritty at all. They were stuffed with pulled pork! Yum! We finished the meal with pulled pork sliders that were slow roasted and very very juicy! All and all this place is the greatest!
