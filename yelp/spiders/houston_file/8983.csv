JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not bad! I'm not a super ramen fan, but they have a great variety of other food to try too. I highly suggest the fried brussel sprouts. They are really good in their dipping sauce. Its got a hip look to it, and group seating for parties. The location is small, like New York restaurant small, so probably call ahead for reservations. The lighting is also kind of dim, but I enjoy that.
