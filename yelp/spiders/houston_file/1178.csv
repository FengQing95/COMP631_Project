JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Hadel - Thanks for your review. You mention our not having many options for those who don't eat pork. Did you consider our various chicken-broth ramen bowls on offer? Or our Spicy Vegan and Vegetable Soup Ramens? While some of our more popular side plates are pork-related, we do have chicken and seafood small plates, as well. Thank you for your visit.
