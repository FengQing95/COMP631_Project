JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////TLDR: Number one ramen in Houston, yes you found it. Â If you don't know what to eat, get anything and everything on the menu, it's all amazing. Even the crispy chicken, which is a great alternative if you don't want to eat ramen...seriously it makes the Colonel wish he never tried to make fried chicken.
