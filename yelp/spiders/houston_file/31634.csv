Local Foods////Local Foods was, for the most part, a great experience. A friend and I went to Local Foods for the first time after a long day at the Fine Arts Museum. The atmosphere was very nice and the design was super cute. My friend is a vegetarian and got a bean patty that she enjoyed very much. My meal, however, was not as enjoyable. I had the Shrimp and Grain salad and while it looked nice, it can't say the same for the taste. It had a saffron vinaigrette that I did not enjoy. That is of course my opinion and I will say that it was a very pretty salad. That being said, I will definitely be going back. I'll just be sure to try a different dish!
