Uchi////Lovely food with some interesting combinations offered. Each plate is unique with an amazing amalgamation of flavors in every bite. Succulent, delectable and absolutely fantastic food. As most of the reviewers have mentioned, brussel sprouts and the fried milk are a must have. I would also recommend the sake and the hama chilli. I liked almost everything that we had ordered. Good service with fresh and delicious food. If you haven't tried it yet, schedule a visit ASAP. Good experience with some fantastic flavor combinations happening.
