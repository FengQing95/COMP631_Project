The Pit Room////You don't need my review to know that this place is amazing. The barbecue is simply top notch. Everything is clearly home made and done in a unique way that will have you comparing it with the best barbecue you've had around the country. I came on a day they had the wagyu beef rib special and it was a unique and delicious eating experience I will never forget (but be prepared for the HIGH cost of the ribs. I recommend sharing). Â The sausage was delicious and the brisket was tender and tasty. The grilled okra special was also fantastic! A complex, tasty sauce little bit of kick to it. Don't skip the pickled veggies!! You cannot go wrong eating here.
