Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Food: We ordered their croissant, kouign-amann, and two macaroons (basil which chocolate and cookie dough).  Their croissant was mediocre.  Although I'm a huge macaroon lover, I loved the kouign-amann.  I've never had anything like it before.  It's like a puff pastry with layers of buttery/sweet carmelized dough.  No wonder my local friends raved about it.  The two macaroons were definitely very creative, but they're not flavors that I crave for.
