Kata Robata////The cake - I didn't catch the name, it was but it was a warm and light cake with toasted almonds on top and dusted cocoa; on the side had blueberry sauce and an earl grey ice cream. It was a pleasure to eat because the combination of the warm cake and the cold ice cream was godly. I don't even like nuts or blueberries, but I really enjoyed the cake.
