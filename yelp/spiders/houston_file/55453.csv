Kata Robata////This is hands down my favorite restaurant. It's very pricey but so worth it. My favorite dish is their Kobe beef and their strawberry short cake dessert. I still remember my first time trying the Kobe beef, I'm pretty sure I cried. To this day, I dream about it and crave it every single day.
