JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went here for lunch with my friends and we both liked it. The place was easy to find and the service was quick. It was a little crowded when we went during lunch, but then again it was lunchtime. We were seated immediately. The food was very good! I got the chicken broth ramen and it literally tasted like a fabulous upgrade from chicken soup. In the end, I will be back!
