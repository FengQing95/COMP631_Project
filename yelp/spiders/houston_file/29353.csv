The Pit Room////With the inconsistencies that can happen with BBQ there is a lot of room for failure.  Fortunately for me the stars aligned and gave me the gift of the most perfect beef rib.  It helps that it started out as an A5 Wagyu cut.  But the execution created a masterpiece which not only melted in my mouth but will remain in my memory as the first best beef Texas style BBQ beef rib :). Kinda like the first time I had Salt Lick's beef brisket a few years back when the opened in Red Rock Station in Las Vegas a few years back.
