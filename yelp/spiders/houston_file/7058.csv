JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kim - Thank you so much for the 5-star review. We love to read reviews like yours that are personal and ultra-specific. We understand that we're never going to be all things to all people, but every once in a while we hit the bullseye with some folks, and when that happens, it truly makes all the hard work and physical effort that goes into running our restaurant worthwhile. Thanks again.
