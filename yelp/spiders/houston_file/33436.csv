Local Foods////Don't overlook the sides though! Namely the tuscan kale, cabbage slaw, and orzo pasta. The first time I ever had kale was at local foods. It tricked me because I thought I liked kale and ordered it at the tasting room and spat it right out. Kale is gross but somehow, Local Foods puts some magic into it and makes it palatable for me. The cabbage slaw has an asian twist to it - I think it has sesame vinaigrette that makes it so good. The orzo has beets in it and it was my first time having beets. Did anyone notice how awfully similar beets taste to baby corn?
