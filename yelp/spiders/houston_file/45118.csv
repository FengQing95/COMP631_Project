Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////What was a pleasant surprise was this Kouign-Aman (I don't know what this is nor can I pronounce it).  This taste flaky like a croissant with a hint of sweetness (I really liked this), the croissants are GREAT and I also ordered the country loaf of bread that looks really good (haven't tried yet).
