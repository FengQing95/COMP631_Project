The Pit Room////Decided to stop in after visiting the museum district for some BBQ. I have to say it wasn't my favorite, they've been open for 2 months now and still fairly new and might just need to work through the trials. Several items were out, so I decided on the Brisket, Mac N Cheese and Charro beans. The brisket dries out once it starts cooling, the Mac N cheese was great but the charro beans had tons of spice nut no flavor. The guest I took with me also had Brisket, Cole slaw and potatoes salad and they truly didn't care for anything. I wouldn't say its awful, its just not worth it either. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere was great, but I wouldn't go back for the food. Maybe it'll get better with time?
