Uchi////I've been to the original Uchi in Austin and loved it.  I'd have to say I love this one even more.  The food of course is an experience not just a meal.  If you're coming here expecting certain flavors you've had elsewhere, you won't get that.  Be open to something different and unexpected, and you'll love it from the first bite.  The service is impeccable here.  Every one of the staff helps to clear any finished plates quickly.
