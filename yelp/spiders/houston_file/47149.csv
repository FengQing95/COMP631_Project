Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Overall, the food was good, but it doesn't stand out from other breakfast/brunch joints. I don't think the wait is worth it, but I am a fan because of the astonishing service I got during my first visit. Katrina is actually why I wanted to start a Yelp account! I can see myself returning once in a while if I'm willing to wake up really early on a weekend morning. Beware of the very limited parking, and prepare to do street parking.
