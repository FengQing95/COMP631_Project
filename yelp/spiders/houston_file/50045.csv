Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Excellent! Â The hubs and I got the pancake flight (pineapple, blueberry, and sweet potato-the pineapple and sweet potato were the best), and the spud deluxe. Had to wait an hour for brunch on a Saturday, but I didn't mind because I hit up several of the consignment and thrift stores in the area while I waited. Snooze will text you when your table is ready. We will be returning.
