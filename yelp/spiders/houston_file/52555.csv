Kata Robata////The happy hour menu (we got there just a little before 5pm when happy hour ends on Sunday) allowed us to try the crunchy eel roll, a chicken-skewer dish whose name escapes me, and the tuna tar-tar.  After my girlfriend had one piece of the crunchy eel roll she immediately ordered another roll - they were that good!  The chicken skewer was really well done, juicy chicken.  That may not seem that great, but at $1 for 3 pieces on a skewer, its worth trying.  The tuna tar-tar was heavenly to me, the rest of the group settled on the crunchy eel roll as the best appetizer, but we're splitting hairs here.
