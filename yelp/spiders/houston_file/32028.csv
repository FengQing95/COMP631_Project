Local Foods////My best friend and I ordered the vegetarian and chicken range sandwiches, sides being the chips, kale, couscous, and quinoa. Our plan was to split the sandwiches so that we got a half of each and shared the sides. Chips were a bit too salty, but the kale and couscous had just the right amount of flavor.
