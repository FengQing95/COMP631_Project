Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The bartenders could not be more friendly and attentive. I had to get their names because they were great! Shout out to Megan and Dave! They nailed it! Â My friend had beer and I chose Kentucky Mules - they were delicious! Perfection! I decided on the tomato soup which comes with grilled cheese and my friend had a salad (I honestly can't remember what he had). I have to admit that the soup was decent, I felt like it was lacking that extra something - it was just "tomato soup" - nothing special. The grilled cheese on the other hand was wonderful. My friend said his salad was really yummy.
