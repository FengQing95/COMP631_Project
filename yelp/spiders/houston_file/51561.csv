Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We came here on New Year's Day and the place was PACKED! We had called to see if we could get on the list before we got there, but they weren't taking call-aheads. When we got there our wait was about an hour and a half. Since it was packed we were pretty much standing shoulder to shoulder in the lobby area. The wait and not having coffee available while we waited is my reason for the 1-star deduction.
