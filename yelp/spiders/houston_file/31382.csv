Local Foods////My husband and I just ate at LF for the first time.  Nice ambiance, comfortable seating, industrial chic decor.  Fresh and delectable food with unusual combinations of flavors. I had a roast beef, cheddar, kale, and curried cauliflower on dense slices of rye.  The bread has to be dense to hold together the stacked high sandwich.  Husband had the shrimp and crab with green goddess dressing in a roll that managed to be both soft and crispy.  Unbelievable.  Try it; you'll love it.
