JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: Came here for a reunion dinner, I was actually feeling a bit under the weather (warning TMI - I had some...GI issues). But I'm glad I came here for some ramen. The noodles delicious broth helped nurture me back to health and I felt GREAT the next morning. I asked the waitress what I should get given how I felt and she recommended the Tokyo Yatai Ramen, combination of pork and chicken. Good portion and delicious combination of the vegetables, creamy egg yolk, and tender meat really hit the spot.
