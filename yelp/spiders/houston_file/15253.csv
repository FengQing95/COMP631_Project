JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Dear JINYA, I just wanted to say...ramen love with you. My boyfriend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8 and it was crowded but the wait wasn't too bad. We sat at the ramen bar in the back and I had the spicy chicken ramen with an extra egg and my boyfriend ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen. Ramen came out sizzling hot and the broth and noodles were cooked to perfection. The egg added a nice touch. I wish I had more room in my belly to do a noodle refill for $2.50. That's a pretty sweet deal. I also highly recommend the lychee mojito. It's light and refreshing. For dessert we had the mochi. One order comes with 2 balls cut in half. They have matcha and chocolate and you can mix and match. The inside is nicely dimmed in a tight space giving off a ramentic vibe. Perfect for date night. Highly recommend.
