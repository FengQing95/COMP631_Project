Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Currently tried the dinner menu at Bosscat Kitchen and Libations for HRW. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Cucumber Salad, the Steak and Potatoes and to finish it off the No Bake Bourbon Cake. The Ahi Tuna Cucumber Salad was very fresh tasting and the perfect amount to start my dinner. For the main entree, the steak was cooked medium, had great flavor and it was soft and tender. The veggies and the potato complemented the steak very well. The No Bake Bourbon Cake balls were amazing. The rye caramel it was served with a little too much for me. The cake tasted great on its own.
