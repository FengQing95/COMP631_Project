Uchi////Obviously by the other reviews, we must have come on a bad night.  My son and I went on the Thursday after Christmas, got there at 5:10 and there wasn't a seat in the house.  We tried to make reservations 5 days ahead but maybe it was because it was after Christmas that there weren't any reservations to be had.
