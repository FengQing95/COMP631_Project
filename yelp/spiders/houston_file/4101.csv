JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Delicious! I found this place on yelp and I love to try new places so I thought, hey, why not? I'm in town for work and, therefore, traveling solo, but they have two bar areas that you can sit at and have a great experience! I suggest the back bar where you can watch the magic happen. I ordered the Premium Tonkotsu White and it was delicious: not too salty and wonderfully filling. I went at lunch time and things were bustling but I was seated right away. If I'm ever back in town, I'll definitely be coming back for another solid lunch!
