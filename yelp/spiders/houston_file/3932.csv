JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is crowded so if you want to go, get going EARLY. It a little on the high side for a bowl of soup, but for special occasion why not. Ours was just that. Very good place. BTW if you go there are tables set up so you are not just sitting with your own, you share a huge long table with others. There are side tables but that is another long wait.
