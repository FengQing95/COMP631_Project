Uchi////Pros: The flavors. The menu constantly is rotated (both because of seasonal ingredients and new combinations that the chefs think up of), and so each visit is different! You get what you order, and dont expect to love the taste of everything. Again, the strength of Uchi is in the combination of flavors: some combinations work for some people, and others for other people. Eat the dish how it was intended to be eaten; eat all the flavors (dont pick and choose the ingredients you like) and appreciate what each one contributes.
