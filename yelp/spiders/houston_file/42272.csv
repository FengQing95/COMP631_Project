Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I was disappointed with their breakfast. First of all, they should change their hours because this place will never be open until 7. It's misleading to customers because their kitchen closes at 3, which should be the time it really closes. The parking lot is always a struggle because of the limited space. For breakfast we got the biscuits and gravy and the French toast. Both were good, but they were so rich it was hard to finish. I think we both pushed to eat half of our entrees and that was a struggle. The pastries were very good though and did not disappoint. We got the croissant, pistachio and salted caramel macarons, and the fruit croissant. Again, found it hard to finish the fruit croissant because of it's richness. Try expanding the breakfast menu.
