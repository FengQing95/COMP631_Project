Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So we are here last night 11-18 my bday great service but the food is not up to par we tried three different dishes parm crusted meatloaf , cajun chicken with rice and greens,and spicy chicken cheese dip. Way too much salt the cajun duty rice tastes like they poured a bunch of blackening season on the rice and nothing cajun about it the dip was really tangy and the parm crusted meatloaf was the best but for spending 85 should of had a better meal
