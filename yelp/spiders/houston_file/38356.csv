Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Let me start this review by saying the ambiance here is awesome for great drinks and conversations with friends and family. Terry and Bre were our servers and they amplified the dining experience!!!! We missed Happy Hour but we totally forgot about that idea from the moment we sat down. Bre started us off with a tour of the Whisky Room and Terry brought it home with his lively and intriguing introduction to the menu! Â
