Uchi////Firstly, I'd like to give a huge thank you to our waitress Jessica who did an amazing job helping us choose our dishes and keeping our meal go very smoothly. She also gave us tasty complimentary brussel sprouts which my girlfriend wanted me to get anyway but I talked her out of it initially so it worked out well.
