JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Crystal - Thank you for your great review. Your feedback is invaluable as it allows us to improve by highlighting issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. I have spoken directly to my managers and waitstaff, and all parties are fully aware they are no longer allowed to "hang out" at the host stand. We try to run a tight ship at JINYA, but sometimes we miss the mark. So I am glad patrons like you are willing and able to express their understanding through constructive criticism; moreover, I am beyond pleased that you enjoy our ramen, especially our signature Tonkotsu broth. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you again soon!
