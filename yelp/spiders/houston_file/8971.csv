JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So as a couple who had been here more than 10 times I will say it is VERY GOOD. Only downfall about this place is the restroom. It is a common area to stand with mean and women while you wait for a single use bathroom to become available. I do wish they had a larger bathroom with stalls to accommodate the traffic here.
