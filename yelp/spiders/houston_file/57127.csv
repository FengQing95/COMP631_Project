Kata Robata////The restaurant was absolutely packed! Both the bar and hostess areas were full with people waiting to be seated. We checked in and was told it was going to be a few minutes wait as they were getting our table ready. Â I looked around the restaurant and didn't see any empty tables so it made me believe that the hostess just wanted us to think we were going to be seated soon. We were not seated until 805pm... While we were waiting for our table, a couple of parties walked in without reservations and I overheard the hostesses told them it was going to be a 30 minute wait. With a full restaurant, a full lobby with guests waiting, and several remaining reservations, I simply couldn't see how that was possible for walk-ins.
