Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we were seated, we took our time to review the menu and make our choices. The only downside was that our server frequently checked in on us despite only a few minutes having passed each time. Not a huge deal though. Our food took a while to be brought out which was fine as well - we knew what we were getting into.
