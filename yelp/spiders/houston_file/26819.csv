The Pit Room////Tried this place for the first time today. I always pass it on Richmond and it has always smelled amazing. I'm a bit leery of bbq places because they are typically overpriced, extremely small portions, and food I would not feed my dog, but hey, I dove in. I was pleasantly surprised. The line was a bit long but moved quickly. I had the 2 meat plate (brisket and pulled pork) with mac n cheese and beans. It was all great tasting, however the brisket was a bit tough (not like a shoe, but not melt in your mouth). The portions are HUGE. My plate was enough for two people and maybe 3 meals for me. I would give this place 5 stars, but the brisket is a 3. The staff were super friendly. I like that! I will be back to try the ribs and sausage.
