Kata Robata////I've tried almost all of their special makis too. The best one is the Texas Hamachi with yellowtail, jalapenos, eel and tempura shrimp. If you don't like spicy rolls, then the longhorn and the rising sun are also pretty good. Pretty much all of the sushi here is good. I've been to a bunch of sushi restaurants where the rice falls apart or the fish is cut too thick. At Kata they have good quality control so neither of those happen.
