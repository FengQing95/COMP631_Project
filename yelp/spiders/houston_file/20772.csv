Uchi////These are all the items, excluding the sake, that we ordered. The food kept getting better each time a new item came out. I wouldn't get the thai oyster again as it was pretty boring and forgettable. But everything else was just wonderful and Chelsea our waitress was a sweetheart. Awesome restaurant. Could hands down be the best restaurant in Houston. When they say the foie gras just melts in your mouth. Sheeeessshhh no lies there. Pretty amazing.
