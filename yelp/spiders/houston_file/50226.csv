Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait!!! First off parking is a complete nightmare but don't let that be a deterrent!!! The wait was about 45 minutes but this was on a Saturday morning. The crowd moved pretty quickly. Once inside the hustle and bustle is very apparent. Although the service you're given is a plus. The food is very fresh and you can definitely tell the difference compared to other breakfast establishments. There's a bar but don't count on it being fully stocked. It's only stocked according to the breakfast themed drinks on the menu. The atmosphere is very laid back and inviting definitely worth the experience.
