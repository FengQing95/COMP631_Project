Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Be prepared to wait a good 20 to 30 minutes in line just to order. I have yet to experience a shorter wait than that after going 3 times. The facility is a bit small and you constantly find yourself dodging other patrons and servers. The level of traffic Common Bond gets is more than what they can hold as there are people constantly waiting or scouting for tables. I suppose thats to be expected for a good place.
