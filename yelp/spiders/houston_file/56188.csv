Kata Robata////I asked for omakase and my server confirmed it with one of the chefs to see if they would be able to accommodate me. Most of the fish was fresh. I was surprised to see Hokkaido uni (or maybe Russian uni fished off of Hokkaido?) on the menu. The only real issue I had was with the Santa Barbara uni. It was not fresh and I would say borderline bad (I've had plenty of SB uni and I know what fresh uni is supposed to taste like).
