Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////NEED MO SALT. In Cooking 101, they teach you how to salt things. I feel like salt is essential in almost every dish, sometimes even in dessert! My boyfriend and I ordered the fried chicken on a biscuit, grillades (stuffed veal breast) + grits, and grilled romaine. The first two were the blandest things I have ever tasted. Not even a grain of salt was to be found. For grits soaked in a brown gravy, I was expecting it to be over-salted and very rich. Nope, it tasted like nothing. Ironically, the salad had the most flavor and I really enjoyed it. Green dressing, pickled onions, citrus wedges, yum! However, it is priced at a whopping $9 for 3 small romaine hearts. Very delicious though!
