JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love this place, the vibrant atmosphere, tasty food and good prices. If you think it's only ramen noodles (which btw are served in a lot of varieties) think again, because it offers a solid variety of appetizers, bowls and desserts. Personal favorite is the Jinya bun. Be ready to wait maybe 10 to 15 minutes cuz it's busy most of the time.
