Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We tried a few items - soft scramble, bialy, egg on a roll, and a chocolate chip cookie. The soft scramble had good texture, but seemed under-seasoned and a little on the bland side. The bialy was good - my first! (A bialy is a Jewish/Polish yeast roll similar to a bagel with a depression in the center that is filled with onions or other ingredients.) My fiance liked his egg on a roll and his chocolate chip cookie. We also had a coffee and a cortado.
