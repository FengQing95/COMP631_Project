Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The drinks were okay, not anything to write home about. The appetizers were pretty good including the Buffalo chicken dip and the pig candy, which was their play on cracklins. I ended up getting the short rib as my main entree. Well, honestly we all did because it seemed to be the best option on the menu. It didn't disappoint, it was tender flavorful and a pretty generous portion.
