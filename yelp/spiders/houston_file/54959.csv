Kata Robata////But, this place isn't just for that. I've been a couple of times and if you are looking for great ambiance and a nice mix of super-good japanese options - from high-end ramen, robata the freshest  sushi/sashimi or more decadent duck/foie gras preparations - despite the many newcomers into the market of late, this place is hard to beat for upscale without snobby ambiance, the freshest ingredients and on-top-of-it friendly service.
