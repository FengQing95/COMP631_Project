Uchi////We furthermore agreed that the service was beyond exceptional.  One of us was quite "not sober" at the beginning of the meal, thus a little rowdy (I won't say who, but it wasn't me this time, boo-yah!) but our waiter was extremely patient and jovial, even humored him or her throughout the two or so hours we were there.  Also, I can only assume Uchi has an extensive hiring and training process because the man knew his stuff, in and out.  We were all quite entertained with the culinary story time and by his friendly disposition.  It was a jolly good time and should definitely be repeated.  The end.
