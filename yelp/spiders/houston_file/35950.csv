Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I came here with my boyfriend and a friend for lunch. We just wanted to check out the place to see how it was. It has a nice concept if you like whiskey. They have a room full of whiskey, and the atmosphere is very trendy. The staff was very nice, and on point with everything. It is definitely a good place to go have a drink and just hang out with your friends.
