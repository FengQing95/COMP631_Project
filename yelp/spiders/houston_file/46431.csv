Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I LOVE this location. I've dined in at this location and placed multiple orders to go. Each time was a pleasant experience. Today I picked up a Valentine's Day cake. It was so cute, and tasted delicious. Shout out to Lee for excellent customer service and getting my custom cake. It came in a nice box and was secure driving home. (My previous review was actually for another location that isn't as good as this one, oops)
