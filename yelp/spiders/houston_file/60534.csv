Baby Barnaby's////For the food items, I got the Bob's healthy plate and the bf got the green eggs. Unfortunately the green eggs had cheese so I opted for something else or I would've gotten that since I see it is a super popular item... I did try a little of the green eggs and they are UH mazing..the eggs just melt in your mouth!!! My plate which consisted of scrambled egg whites were fantastic...they were super moist and tasty- so this alternative was definitely a win!
