Uchi////Perfect ambiance- romantic and also perfect to go with friends. We did their "trust the server" tasting menu. You basically tell the server what you like and what you don't like and rest they pick the plates for you. You also tel them your budget. I have to say that each dish was mouth watering, def try their fried milk dessert. I would like to state that this isn't very authentic Japanese place, it has an American twist to it. We enjoyed it very much and it was worth the price!
