Kata Robata////This review is only about spicy soy ramen. I continue to like this ramen in Houston. But there are two thing that they need to address. One, they need to try other noodle type. I think that wavy more hard consistent noodle will do better. Second, the temp of the broth. I have asked to make it hot but I think the chef still does not know what I mean by for ramen broth temp. Hope that these changes will bring this ramen to another level.
