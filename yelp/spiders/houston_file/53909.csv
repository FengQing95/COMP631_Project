Kata Robata////Dessert at Kata is a bit on the ordinary side and I had even ventured to have the chocolate dessert served with mango. It was different, but I think the rich blend of creamy dark chocolate and acidic mango didn't quite go together. If you really have a sweet tooth, you may want to head next door to Dessert Gallery instead.
