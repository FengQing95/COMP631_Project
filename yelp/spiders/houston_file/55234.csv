Kata Robata////The food is good, but it is definitely pricey! I had a lychee martini which was okay. I also had grilled squid which was very good. Their strawberry shortcake was delicious though! Sometimes it's hard to find parking. Just because of their prices, this wouldn't be my first pick for a sushi restaurant.
