Local Foods////So a friend recommended this place as a good option for dinner. I glanced at the menu and saw it had healthy options and it was easy to eat vegetarian. Needless to say, I was more than impressed. Her salad was absolutely delightful. But my vegetarian sandwich was heavenly! Great flavors, awesome sides and all at an affordable price. We were both stuffed for $21. I will be back!
