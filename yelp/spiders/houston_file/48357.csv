Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I don't understand why ppl like this place. It's mediocre at best. I've even had the original one in Denver and it was equally as underwhelming. Prices aren't outrageous, but the wait time is ridiculous. Diner food would be better than this. People only go because it's trendy. I'll pass.
