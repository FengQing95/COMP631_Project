Local Foods////Delicious food. Kale salad with Parmesan is great, and so is the vegan chili. Maybe even better than the food is the space. Exposed brick walls, industrial steel touches, bright leather upholstered chairs and these bright turquoise booths. Lots of light. Busy on a Saturday morning but still not crowded or too loud. Highly recommend!
