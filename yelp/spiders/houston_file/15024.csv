JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Still delicious ramen, however service has declined just a tad. Not expecting amazing service, but consistency is key. As said in my previous yelp....parking will always be an issue. My husband orders the same thing, and he tends to drop me and the rest of the party off at the door so he could find space in an already packed parking garage. Once, we were seated immediately after I told the host he was parking. My last experience, the host was a little short and stated we needed to wait for the entire party (even if I know what to order my husband). That time spent waiting in the small lobby space could have been time spent seated at a table with many cocktails. Instead, we waited. Ordered our usual, (minus alcohol because of the inconsistency in service) and left understanding now they're options for ramen in this large city.
