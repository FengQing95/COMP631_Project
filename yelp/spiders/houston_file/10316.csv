JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya Bun ($3.95 for one) - solid and good. Not too fatty or salty. My boyfriend liked it a lot. I, on the other hand, thought it was too greasy and oily so I ended up not finishing mine, but I still thought it was pretty flavorful..not for almost $4 for one though. But can't complain since it is located in the heart of Midtown.
