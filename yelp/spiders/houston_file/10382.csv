JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Myra - Thank you for the stars. I'm so glad you enjoyed our ramen, and that you had a great experience dining with us. Sometimes when we get busy, even the smallest mistake on our part, which unfortunately is very common, can derail everything. So I'm glad we were able to accommodate you and your daughter.
