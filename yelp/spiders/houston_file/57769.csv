Kata Robata////Made a reservation for 5 for 8:30pm. I got there around 8:20 and the wait was about an extra 30 minutes. Though the wait was long, the food made up for it. I'm not even going to pretend like I remember what the dishes are called but they were all really really good. If anything, just show the waiter the pictures ^_^
