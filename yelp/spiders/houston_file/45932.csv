Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Came here today to enjoy fresh croissants and hot chocolate with my friend and was shocked at how horrible they treat their customers. There was a line to place an order but they started actually coming up to each person in a line and take orders. I'm currently 9 months pregnant and standing on my feet is not too comfortable so my friend offered to wait in line and order for me. I sat at one of the open tables, after about 3 min a supervisor came up to me and told me that I have to get up and get in line, because according to their policy you can only take a table after you placed your order. I did say that there's my friend ordering right now but this person still told me I had to get up and free the table because that their policy (after looking at my belly, oh and yes, with my body build it's pretty obvious that I'm pregnant). Well, guys, if it's your policy, then you should be ashamed of how you implement it and you should be ashamed that a person with no principles is supervising your place. You need to learn a thing or two about hospitality, because for now it's hostility. Â This one star is for your baked goods, cause they are good, unlike your customer service.
