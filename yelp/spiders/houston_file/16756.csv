JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time at this spot but judging by the reviews I was in for a treat. I was a little skeptical because I've had ramen before but never as a Take-out dish. Thanx to the times of COVID I was willing to order ramen take-out. Online ordering was easy but the wait time was quite long (almost 2 hours). This was a Monday night so I thought my order would've been ready a lot sooner. I arrived maybe 30 min. early and sure enough this place was busy. A busy restaurant is a sign that delicious food awaits! Anyhow when my order was ready- pick up was quick and simple.
