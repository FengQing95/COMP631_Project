Baby Barnaby's////One of the best breakfast spots in Montrose.  The staff are all super nice and friendly.  I love getting the egg white burrito with a wheat tortilla and veggies on the side.  Pancakes are really good here too.  Plus your basic eggs & bacon dish are great.  All good here is really good.  Parking is across the street or around the corner or wherever you can find it - typical for Montrose.
