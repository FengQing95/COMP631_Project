Uchi////I'm far overdue for a review here. We've been here several times and I've had the majority of the menu items. My favorites are the brussel sprouts, hama chili, madai carpaccio, the hot rock and usually the daily specials. The service is always above and beyond here and it makes your meal so much more memorable. We even had a James Harden sighting during our last dinner. The new patio waiting area makes the wait time pass much more quickly. One thing I want to add is that if you aren't drinking, you can definitely have a full meal here for an affordable price. We spend more at Italian restaurants than here when we come and are always surprised our bill comes out to less than a hundred for a nice dinner for two.
