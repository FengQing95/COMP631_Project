JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Amazing ramen! This place made me fan of ramen I crave it now. Spicy pork ramen is my go to. Service is great. The ambience is really nice too. I've order out a couple times and that was fast (~15mins). If you haven't been, you need to check this place out, it'll make you a regular
