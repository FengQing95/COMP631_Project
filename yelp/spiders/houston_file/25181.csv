Uchi////High end restaurant chains rarely do work and this sushi establishment is no exception. It's like paying for a Beyonc√© concert and getting the backup singers. The food was ok and the service was inconsistent (a btl of wine arrived at the end of the meal). Yelpers love it more than teddy bears... so may have to give it another chance.
