JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We also employ full-time chefs whose one and only job is to oversee the production of our broths. In addition, these broth chefs use specialized Refractometers to check the thickness and consistency of the broth during each preparation. If a batch fails to meet standards, we don't serve it. Of course, I fully understand that taste is subjective and that we will never be all things to all people.
