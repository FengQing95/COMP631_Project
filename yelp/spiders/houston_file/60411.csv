Baby Barnaby's////My cousin had the chicken pesto salad sandwich with artichoke hearts.  She had a choice of a side, and she chose the tomato soup which she said was excellent.  (It had a more exotic name, but I don't remember what it was.)  The sandwich was huge, and she ate half and took the other half home.
