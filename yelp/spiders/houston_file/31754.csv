Local Foods////I love this place so much! The decorations and designs are so cute. The sandwiches are just amazing. Crunchy chicken is delicious like everyone else says and so are the sides. I also tried their roast beef and didn't like it as much. It wasn't a bad sandwich or anything, I'm just not a fan of that type of sandwich. Overall the concept of this restaurant is so adorable and super simple. I love it! I would recommend anyone to come and check it out!
