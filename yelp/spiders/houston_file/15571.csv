JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Restaurant was busy because of seating closed due to social distancing. Sat at the bar and got to go food. Chelsea and Chau was very attentive, not only to guests but was so nice to grub hub and other delivery services where she did not get a tip from. Make sure you come in and tip this wonderful woman.
