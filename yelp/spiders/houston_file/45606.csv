Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Houston has great food, but it is disappointing when it comes to genuinely good dessert options. And I don't mean ice cream when I say dessert but a good patisserie... which is why I love common bond! I'm a big dessert person and I would rate this as one of the best dessert places in the city...
