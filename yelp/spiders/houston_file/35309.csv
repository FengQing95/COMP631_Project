Local Foods////I was quite pleased with this restaurant and plan on going there again! I had the quinoa burger and my friend had the seafood sandwich-both were excellent as well as the white bean soup and the sides of kale salad and broccoli quinoa salad. The staff was very accommodating. Â The only things I would add is that they brought my friend's sandwich/soup out way before they brought my quinoa burger out
