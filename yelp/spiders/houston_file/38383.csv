Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I'm so glad the bar is still open during covid crisis. The service is awesome, I order the spicy cheese and garlic Brussel sprouts, so delicious! Got their burger and pork chops super delicious, not dry at all. Their drinks were also strong and affordable. Did an reservation online, just to be safe and good thing i did, got busy towards the night.Went with my fianc√© for anniversary and it was a good joint. Still new to houston and trying new places. Overall it was good experience, clean bathrooms and place.
