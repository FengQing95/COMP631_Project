Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food. I had the beef hash....... very very good. Different in the way they make it...... it's more large chunks of beef and shredded potatoes but it was really good. Hash browns were amazing and the eggs very good fresh quality. Pancakes best I have ever had in my life.
