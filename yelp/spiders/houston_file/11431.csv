JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We sat down and were immediately greeted by our Waitress. I wish I had asked her name! She was on top of it. We ordered water and our meals. We had the cha cha cha noodles. With Tokyo curry added to our meal we also ordered another ramen (Ughhhh! Can't remember the name) and we added the pork chashi and rice to it. She brought us our salads and water pretty fast. Our food not too long after. OMG. Legit... So happy we had dinner here. The food was on point. Soooooo good.the noodles were cooked perfectly, so many flavors. The meat was tender! My least favorite was the Tokyo curry. Ehhhh. I probably wouldn't order it again l, but still glad we tried it. It didn't look very appetizing either. Not saying it tasted nasty...Cuz it didn't. Anyways.... I can't wait to come back!!!
