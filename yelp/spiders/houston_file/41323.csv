Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Just tried this for the first time and while the line was long it was very worth the wait! We had three pasties and each one was amazing!!!  The fresh squeezed orange juice was good but not served cold, which I would have liked better.  The seating is extremely limited and the whole place is tight, everything VERY close together, so it's not a very relaxing environment but it won't stop me from going back mainly because the food was fabulous.  I will just make sure to bring a small purse so that I don't feel like I'm gonna knock something down if I turn around with a big purse.   I may see if there's a time when it's not so jammed packed.  I'd definitely recommend it for the food - not so much for the atmosphere.
