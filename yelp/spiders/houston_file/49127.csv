Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It also took awhile for our food to come out, but the food tasted great. The girlfriend and I shared the Breakfast Pot Pie, Ham Benedict III, and Chili Verde Benny. Everything came out hot and fresh. My favorite out of the three was definitely the Chili Verde Benny, which I highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique benedict experience. The poached eggs on the Ham Benedict III were cooked perfectly with the egg yolks oozing out and the Breakfast Pot Pie was warm and comforting.
