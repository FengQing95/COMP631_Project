JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When we came in at 1PM, it seemed like we were just at the beginning of the lunch rush (and not the end).  This place was packed for Tuesday late lunch.  People were still coming in.  This was a huge contrast as Children's Museum was totally empty.  The server saw us with 2 kids and a baby, and immediately went to prepare us a place.  She asked us if we needed a high chair or a booster (I appreciate that I didn't need to ask for one) We sat at the end of the long table with the white rocks in the middle.  Beautiful modern decor.
