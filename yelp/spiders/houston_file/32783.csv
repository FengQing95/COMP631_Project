Local Foods////I decided to try something different for lunch today, and I was not disappointed! The menu is plain and simple, making sure any choice you make for your meal hard to disappoint you. I had the highly rated crunchy chicken sandwich with a choice of two sides of which I chose the Tuscan Kale, and homemade chips. Everything was DELICIOUS. You get A LOT of food; however, I had that awkward amount of food where its too much to finish it all but too little to take to go.
