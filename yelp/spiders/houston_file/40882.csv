Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Hubby and I went for the Monday night "Steak Night" the food was great. Service was excellent. The atmosphere and the vibes were good. Excellent bar services as well. I would definitely go back there. Next time will be for a happy hour. Can always use a place to wine down from the stress of a day.
