Local Foods////With regards to food options, I highly recommend ordering the sandwiches-especially the Banh Mi and Crunchy Chicken. On both, the bread is beautifully crisp and fresh, almost as if it were baked right beforehand. My favorite-the Banh Mi-comes with really fresh ingredients and flavors. The cilantro and pickled veggies cut the creamy aioli and hearty pork, providing a nice lightness to the otherwise bold sandwich. The jalape√±o gives a bit of spice at the end, which I really like (though some of my friends have found it to be a bit overpowering). The Crunchy Chicken offers a similar balance of flavors and textures but is a much heavier sandwich. For me, the sandwich is a bit overkill with the bread, fried chicken, ranch, and cheese; however, the sandwich still presents a nice combination considering the saltiness of the pretzel bun and acidity from the pickles. Also, if either any of the sandwiches are too heavy, or if you are trying to keep up with New Year's Resolutions, you can change them into a salad, which (contrary to popular belief) were still very tasty.
