Baby Barnaby's////I can't stop thinking about it!!  What a great breakfast!!  I had the green eggs and they were delicious!!  We all shared a pumpkin pancake, also delicious!  The potatoes were great and the chicken apple sausage was really good.   My son got the Huevos Rancheros and I have to go back and get that next time.  It was amazing.  I want to try everything on the menu!  The experience was also really great because the staff was amazing!  They were so sweet!!  So glad we went!!
