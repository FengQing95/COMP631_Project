Local Foods////I've never been to a sandwich shop quite like this one. I'm not from Texas, so my friend was taking me to all the good local places and this place is by far one of my favorites. I got the crispy chicken sandwich with a side of tabouli and kale. SO. TASTY. The sandwich can get messy, but it was totally worth it. And thank goodness we missed the lunch rush. If I ever go back to Texas, I will definitely go back and try some of their other sandwiches!
