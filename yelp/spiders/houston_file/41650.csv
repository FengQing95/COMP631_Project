Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's really upsetting that a bakery puts SOLD OUT sign on the baked goods at 1 pm. This is a bakery and people come to you for that and you should provide! There is no bakery that has sold out signs in the window. Come on and provide for your costumers. It doesn't make your items wanted more. It makes the whole process annoying
