Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Hmmm where to even start.  I've been to the original in Colorado, so I already know that they have great food.  This review is on their service and atmosphere.  Let's just say that it was superb for us.  Our waiter Darius was very attentive and although he had a multitude of tables to serve, he was able to get this to us In a timely manner.  Lots of other waiters came to check in is also.  Granted, we had a cute baby with a snooze onesie on, maybe that helped??
