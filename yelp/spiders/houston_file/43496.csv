Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A follow up to my previous 3 star review--went back to CB since I was in the neighborhood, and wanted to stop by. This time, my experience was much better, and much more enjoyable. Fantastic drip coffee, fantastic salmon dish, fantastic scone. Didn't ask about fresh juice this time. I'll go back often. Only knocks on the place are what everyone else seems to say--parking isn't easy (fine, we live in town, so not unexpected), and the seating is a little tight. Recommended otherwise.
