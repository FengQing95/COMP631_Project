Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Whiskey was the main theme at this restaurant! Amazing menu full of options and great cocktails! Starters we chose were pulled pork hush puppies & spicy chicken and cheese dip...both were yummy! The main I chose was the 12 hour beef short rib..and oh my delicious! Melt in your mouth goodness! Came with onion straws,green beans,and au gratin potato's! Had some kiddos with us,no kids menu but they enjoyed the Mac n cheese and burger!
