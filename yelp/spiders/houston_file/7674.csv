JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////They fill takeout orders in no time at all. They'll tell you that a takeout order takes 15 minutes, maybe even 25 if it's busy. This is not my experience, though. I am about a 5 minute drive from Jinya, and I always go straight there after I call in a takeout order. It's always ready when I get there.
