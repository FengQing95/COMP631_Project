JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////When I first tried Jinya prior to signing up as a Franchisee, I didn't like their ramen very much.  Felt the broth was too light and bland.  I talked to my server and they took it back and prepared something else for me to try.  The second one hit the spot.  I'm not sure what your broth and taste preference might be, but I would like to invite you back and try something different this second time around.  We carry 11 different types of ramen on our menu and each has it's own broth.  Ask for me or any of my managers and we will be glad to pair a ramen to your preferences.  I'm sure you will definitely find something you like.
