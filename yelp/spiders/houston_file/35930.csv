Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Okay sooooo...(you know a story will be good when it starts out with those two words) This is the sweetest little nugget of a whiskey bar. From the time we walked in the door and were greeted by the pretty blond hostess until our sever, Tim..(side bar) Let's talk TIM!! He was phenomenal. His personality is warm and attentive without being overbearing or obnoxious. He explained the menu and even engaged in astrology talk with me...WINNING. The cocktails were cold and the food was hot. Those shrimp and grits tho. I'm not from Houston but when I do visit, Bosscat will be a staple.
