Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If there was an option to rate this place with zero stars I would.  I tried to book the Whiskey Room for a party of 10 and not only was the GM unhelpful and unwilling to budge with our request to be served off the menu vs. having a pre-fixed menu for a party of 10 also the owner was unwilling to make exceptions - even after offering to pay the $1000 minimum + 22% gratuity.  What do they do when they have a party of 10 in their restaurant?  Do they also make them have a pre-fix menu?  Their loss because this could have added business to their decline in business for 2020 and 21 due to the pandemic.  Yes, I read their news articles - but I no longer can offer sympathy over their ignorance to turn down the guaranteed cash and tip for their restaurant and wait staff.  Sorry wait staff - it could have been a good night for you.
