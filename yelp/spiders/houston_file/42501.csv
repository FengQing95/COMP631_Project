Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Some improvement must be made on the priority between bar and kitchen. We ordered drinks, pastries, and entrees. The entree came to us before the drinks, with noticeable time discrepancy. This doesn't mean that our drinks came a minute after our food, it means that we were halfway done eating and forced ourselves to slow down so we will have food left when the drinks came. I understand that it was busy and everyone is still kind of new, but the drinks should always reach the customer before or at least at the same time the food does. And we sat at the bar, so we saw that our drinks were prepared but stayed there for a good time being. Same thing happened again when my mom ordered a latte to go at the end of the meal and it took them another ten minutes to get it to us. This little detail is not enough to deter me from coming here, but it is definitely an area that needs looking at.
