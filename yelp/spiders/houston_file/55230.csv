Kata Robata////I've been here many times, since my first review in October of 2013, and I have to update Kata Robata to 5 stars. Everytime I eat here everything is on target. The wait staff, the sushi chefs, the boh, everything! Even the bathroom doesn't dissapoint. The food here is amazing and consistent. It's my go to place for sushi in Houston and they serve a great bowl of Ramen that you'd be hard pressed to get anywhere else. The ramen was hot, and creamy, this never dissapoints...order it seven times in a row, and you'll get the same awesomeness you had everytime before. Â The sushi continues to lead my taste buds right back to here. This is officially a "rave review". Keep up the good dependable work and standards KR !
