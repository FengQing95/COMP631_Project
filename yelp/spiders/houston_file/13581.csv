JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is pretty good. They are fairly busy, and you aren't supposed to park right out front... so make sure you keep that in mind when picking up your order. I ordered Togo and for whatever reason, it wasn't as good as when dining in. I heated up my soup as hot as I could before pouring it onto the noodles and it still didn't really seem right. Idk. But overall, it was good. The seasoned egg was delicious.
