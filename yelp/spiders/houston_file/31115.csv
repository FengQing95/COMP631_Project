Local Foods////I went to Local Foods for the first time and was very satisfied with the food and service that this small, "local" restaurant had to offer. The quality as well as quantity of the food provided both me and my mother enough to take home leftovers and the service was quick and friendly to say the least! I ordered a crunchy chicken sandwich with two sides (quinoa and cabbage slaw). It all was absolutely delicious! I would the compare the food to something straight out of Whole Foods. It was fresh, healthy, and tasty. The atmosphere was cozy with dim lights accompanied by cute twinkle lights here and there. The comfy, colorful chairs, large wooden tables, and indie-like decor looked like one in an Anthropologie magazine. The food was well-worth what you paid for and has left my mother and me wanting to come back for more. Too bad we live in Florida...
