Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend ordered the breakfast pot pie, I got the pancake flight (you chose which three you want). I had pumpkin, chocolate chip and the drunkenmunky french toast). I do have to admit that some of the pancakes are a little to sweet for my liking but delicious non the less. I am in love with the french toast! Â I also ordered the hash browns (ask for them extra crispy).
