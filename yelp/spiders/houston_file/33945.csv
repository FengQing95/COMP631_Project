Local Foods////Almost all of the sandwiches are delicious here! They are all unique and flavorful in their own way. Have tried most of them and I am a fan. The freshly baked breads used in the sandwiches are crunchy and tasty. The dessert, such as the 'blondie' is good. Well.. not so much the 7 layer bar. It is too crumbly and falls apart.. Do not get it. Anyhow, Local Foods is a nice spot to drop by for lunch or even dinner. Soups on the menu are hearty and filling as well. The large selection of vegan food is awesome. I particularly enjoy the flavorful sides that you can pair with a sandwich. Seafood (salmon, shrimp and crab) are fresh and the vegetables and produce are crisp. This is my preferred location of Local Foods. Their is plenty of seating and it is a nice spot to bring friends or family. It is unique and spacious inside the restaurant. Truly a lovely place to dine locally and casually in the city.
