Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We tried to go here so many times but always ended up leaving since it's impossible to find parking in the lot. You pretty much need to park down the street unless you come right when someone is leaving. We came here for brunch and the food was just okay, nothing spectacular, although the bakery is what I would highly recommend. Surprisingly the macarons are one of the best I've had in Houston so far. If I were to come back, I'd go for coffee and pastries only. There is also a pretty long line when you go during brunch time on the weekends and it's hard to find a table. I went with 3 other people and we had to share the community table.
