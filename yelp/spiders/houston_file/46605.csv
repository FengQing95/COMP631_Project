Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very late to the game here and to add insult to injury I'll confess I haven't made it inside the restaurant. Due to the long wait on. a Sat morning we did a quick phone order (different menu available for this). The wait for our curbside pick up was as pleasant as could be and our bacon egg flatbread and chocolate ganache cookies were delicious. The iced coffee was literally the icing on a great morning for me-perfectly blended and just the right amount of sweetness and ice, The ordering process was super easy and the the waitress who took our order was so sweet! I really can't wait to go back and try it for a real brunch.
