Kata Robata////I always end up ordering two salmon carpaccios even when I tell myself not to. Thinly sliced pieces of salmon with hints of lemon along with some delicious crunchy goods along with strips of greens. Very refreshing dish! As for the shu mai, it is very different from the dim sum xiu mai, At first, I was a bit skeptical about it and thought it would be Americanized dim sum but it was very flavorful and juicy. It is served with 3 shu mais and they give you pipettes of some ponzu sauce that I like to only squeeze a little bit on top and eat the spoonful of shu mai. Cooked well as the consistency is not mushy and has a somewhat elastic bounce to the pork. Brussel sprouts are yummy and good to have as a side along with the 'kobe beef' skewers that are so well flavored and fall right off of the skewers. I wouldn't say it is as marbled as the kobe beef in Japan but they did very well making the beef! I always end with the green tea souffle cheesecake since it's not overly strong with the matcha and feels much lighter for a dessert as opposed to regular cheesecake.
