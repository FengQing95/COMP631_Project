JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Update 10/21/18: I've been coming to Jinya since 2015 and I have to say that the service has changed for the better. When I first started going to Jinya the service has always been okay, why? Because they profile people based on looks. So if they felt that you're not going to tip then it's half a** service you'll get. I'm so happy that the owner reached out to me and sincerely apologize to me on the lack of service I've been getting. I know I might look like a college student but I always tip 20 percent or higher why? Because someone like me who use to work for the restaurant industry knows how it feels when you're doing an awesome job and ends up getting zero zip zilch nada in tips. Now on to the food, I can say just about everything on the menu is amazing, my favorite dish is the Tonkotsu Spicy & the Tonkotsu black with the thin noodles and extra eggs, yum yum. This place is my favorite Ramen place to go to and I will continue to spend my money here as long as the service stays the same, keep up the great work.
