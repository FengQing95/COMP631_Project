Kata Robata////My toro short rib roll was delicious, however.  The beef was tender and well seasoned and the toro top notch.   However, the roll prices here are hefty.  Most seemed $15 plus.  When compared to the frankly better food at MichiRu, I can honestly say Kata is a distant second in the race.
