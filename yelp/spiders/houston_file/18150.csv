Uchi////After eating at some higher end places in various cities, including Houston, I was let  down by Uchi. My husband and I chose this for our anniversary and made reservations in advance. We ordered the 6 course menu because the 10 course didn't have some of the original house specialities on it and decided to add on items from the current menu.  The food was 4 stars, but the atmosphere (too loud) and service pacing was more of a 2.5ish in my book. I'd give this place a 3.5 rating if I had the option. The waiters were very educated on the dishes, but our dishes weren't spaced out. When ordering a tasting menu I'd expect to have a little down time between the dishes, but I guess because we ordered the add ons it threw it off and at one point we had 3 different dishes on the table and we aren't slow eaters either. It just wasn't special like the meal we had at Oxheart.
