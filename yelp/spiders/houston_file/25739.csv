The Pit Room////Love it!!  We've had the ribs, brisket, & pork sausage - all excellent.  Love the bbq sauce.  Saw some yelp comments about the potato salad - DON"T CHANGE THE RECIPE!!!  It was phenomenal, it was perfect!!  The family loved the mac and cheese - couldn't get enough.  The cole slaw was definitely fresh, but it is not the sweet kind - just a different taste preference.  The daughter loved the ice cream sandwich.  Will be back many times.
