Kata Robata////The sushi here is amazing! Kata is the perfect choice for when you want to splurge on awesome food. I've been here a bunch and I've only had one experience where the service was sub par and slow. My favorite menu items are: New Zealand King Salmon (it legit melts like butter on your tongue), Rising Sun Roll, Caribbean Roll, and Miso Lobster Mac and Cheese. When I was pregnant I tried their Pork Ribs and it was super tasty. It may not have cured my sushi cravings, but it was an acceptable alternative since I was fairly concerned about eating raw fish while pregnant.  I used to love eating their strawberry shortcake dessert, but it's no longer a menu item :(  Also, we just recently ordered sushi to go from here and it was still awesome. Unfortunately, I can't remember everything we ordered, but we had a variety of sashimi and it did not disappoint.
