Baby Barnaby's////Delicious breakfast. We all had the breakfast plate with the green eggs and the toast and potatoes. It was a huge serving of food. Parking was difficult and there was a bit of a wait and IT WAS freezing but the food was great. We could not finish it all, but I sure did try. I typically dont eat much eggs but these were good. They were a bit creamy and kindve reminded me of spinach dip, I believe there were artichokes in them as well. Give them a try. We went on a weekend brunch day.
