The Pit Room////This is my first barbeque place I eat in Houston. It's really good, some of the meat (I forgot the name) is really crunchy (the skin) and seasoned really well. The sides are really good too especially the corn. I recommend eating here when you come to Houston. The price is about $15-$20 if you wanna get the most out of it. The pies look really good but we didn't get any because we were full. We ordered the Feast (the one for 4-6 people).
