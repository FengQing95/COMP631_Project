Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Here comes the con. The line is long and wait time is really bad at times.  The parking is limited to the small parking in back of the store.  And the patisseries are a bit pricey for my taste.  I ordered the plain blue berry muffins, which is just plain nothing interesting.  I compare to the muffins come out of the COSTCO box.  For the price of one I could got 12 and it taste almost the same.  I guess you paid for the location.  The ambient is really nice.  But I don't know if it is worth the price.
