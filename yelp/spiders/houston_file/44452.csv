Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love this place! If you like pastries or desserts, you should definitely come here. My favorite breakfast items are the biscuits and gravy and the avocado toast. The biscuits are soooo good here and I like the jalape√±o sausage in the gravy. I tend to order the egg on the side. Next time I'm going to try the soft scrambled eggs!! I wish they would carry Diet Coke though....
