Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The food was very tasty, nothing was too salty. My mom loved her Doughnut burger, and she doesn't like a runny egg at all. Â I really liked the hollandaise sauce on my Benedict, eggs poached perfectly and the biscuit kind tasted like a "fry" bread in texture. Great Portions for the price and good service. Definitely a good idea.
