Uchi////Really this is three stars for food, and two stars, maybe 1.5 for service. I agree with the general consensus that the brussels sprouts are killer. And the foie nigiri was wonderful. However, we waited 45 minutes to be seated for our 8 pm reservation and there is NO PLACE TO WAIT. You walk in and the hostess says, "Okay, if you'd like to start at the bar, we'll come get you when your table's ready." Then you discover that there's 40 people waiting at a 6 seat bar. Oh, and no time estimate as to when your table is ready. At one point, we counted 80 people waiting for tables (it's only about a 120 seat restaurant), including a large party who, according to the organizer of that group, had been waiting almost 2 hours for the private dining room that they reserved. Seriously? While the food was well executed once we actually got to sit down, the restaurant's table management just put a damper on the whole night. Maybe because I've eaten at places like this in other cities, it just doesn't seem worth the hassle. I'll go elsewhere next time.
