JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Dropped in for cocktails but ended having a snack . Cool Asia decor with a nice bar and excellent drink selections . We only ordered the fried shrimp app but it was perfect - crispy , hot and tender . Service was very personal and friendly - the place was busy so it's obviously a fan fav . I will definitely be back to have some proper Ramen !
