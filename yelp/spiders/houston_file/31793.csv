Local Foods////For what they do... This place is delicious. Biting into the food you can tell they use quality ingredients straight from the farm! Also the interior looks really cool well done. The drinks here are also sooo good I recommend the mint lemonade. Local foods is a very clean establishment that pumps out the food in relatively no time at all...
