Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is my favorite brunch place in Houston! The food is fantastic and the wait staff is incredibly friendly. I always get the pancake flight, which is your choice of any three pancakes, and a side of bacon. The bacon is cut pretty thick and comes out crispy (which I like).
