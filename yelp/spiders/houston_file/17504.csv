Uchi////Amazing meal!  We ordered a wide array of items and our server sent them out in order from lightest to heaviest, every dish was almost better than the last.  The most surprising aspect was how fantastic the desserts were.  We shared five between the four of use and every single one was perfection.  I even got my non-fish eating husband to try sushi...and he enjoyed it.
