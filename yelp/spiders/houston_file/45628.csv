Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came here because their custom cakes were highly recommended to me by friends and family. With my son's 7th birthday right around the corner, getting the cake from here was a no brainer. When I came with my mom to order the cake, we decided to grab a bite first. I picked the avocado toast, which was highly recommended by the cashier and my mom ordered the biscuits with gravy and jalape√±o sausage. Everything was spectacular! Especially the biscuits with gravy, because the sausage was bursting with flavor. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's obvious that they're using fresh and rich ingredients so spending that money was well worth it. When we received my son's cake two weeks later, I was very pleased, but when my son finally saw it he was FLOORED, and his reaction was the cherry on the sundae! I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying their lunch and dinner.
