JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went to JINYA for lunch to kick-off my daughter's 13th birthday celebration. She's a ramen expert so the bar was high! Overall we had a 5star experience.  I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and she had the Tonkontsu (spelling) and both were delicious.  Just the right amount of heat, salt, and perfectly tender noodles.
