Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been wanting to try this place for so long. Super cute contemporary style a lot of natural lighting. I came here on Memorial Day at around noonish. They were busy with a line already formed, it moves pretty quick. Tables were arranged together and since they were so busy most ppl were okay to share the same table. Water was self served in addition to utensils. They had a great selection of pastry you must try it!!
