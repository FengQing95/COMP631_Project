Kata Robata////The meal is an experience. This takes sushi to an entirely new level. We ordered the Kobe beef skewers to start- top 2 cuts of beef I've had in my life. Omakase for the meal, which was a mix of nigiri and sashimi with fresh Japanese fish options, and then a banana crepe brûlée to top it all off. For drinks we had the lychee martini and the sashito mojito. Best sushi I've ever had and it was great trying new fish you can't get at most places with the Omakase. We can't wait to return and try some of their rolls.
