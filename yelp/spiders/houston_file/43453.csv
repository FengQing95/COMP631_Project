Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service was excellent and the staff were friendly and encouraging, they gave recommendations and explained the types of pastries there. I didn't know it was a seasonal menu because I looked on Yelp before coming to the bakery to find that there wasn't an entree that was posted on Yelp. The food is very tasty though, however the lavender latte I got wasn't so tasty. I would recommend to come here but will take away a star because it's pretty pricey for breakfast and coffee. It is a cafeteria type style so there isn't a server but they will bring the food to you. Overall I would recommend trying out this place.
