Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So this restaurant/ bar is an awesome place to meet with your friends. Their isn't a lot of parking so be prepared to pay for valet or drive around a bit to find parking. But once you get in there the inside is very spacious. They also have two small patio areas that you can enjoy right outside the front of the building. They bar area is large and probably sits around 25 people. They offer tall tables, booths, private rooms, and single small tables. The brunch is something to look forward to because its so yummy. I like to come here with the girls because its such a beautiful place, the food is yummy, and the liberations are set at a great price.
