Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait was 1hr. But the food was worth the wait. Next time I will call in advance & see how long the wait time is. I got the pancake, chorizo, with egg. My friend got the shrimp and grits. Everything was bomb! Pancake takes up the whole plate so it's great for sharing FYI
