Local Foods////Local Foods prides itself on using local, fresh ingredients - the atmosphere and menu closely resemble its big brother Benjy's next door (the owner of Benjy's also owns Local Foods). We tried the crunchy chicken and salt & pepper roast beef sandwiches. The crunchy chicken was definitely "crunchy" and crusted in a nut coating with a handful of crushed homemade potato chips on top. The roast beef was moist, but the salt & pepper flavors didn't stand out as much as we expected. All their sandwiches come with two sides or a soup . We chose the sides and got the Asian-inspired coleslaw, kale salad and homemade potato chips. The kale salad was our favorite with golden raisins, pine nuts, and parmesan tossed in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. We loved the fact that they offered a variety of fresh sides and not just your typical fries or bagged chips.
