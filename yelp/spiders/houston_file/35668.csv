Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went for lunch with some co-workers mid week.  Service was fantastic and the food was above average as everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  The hush puppies were tasty (especially the sauce) but I would have liked them to have more meat inside them.  The burger was perfectly cooked and quite flavorful.  The bosscat fries were a perfect side to go with the burger.  Will be back to check out the whiskey selection.  Worth checking out, especially if you work in the galleria.
