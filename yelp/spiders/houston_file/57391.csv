Kata Robata////My favorite was the fatty tuna. It literally melted in my mouth and was so fresh and light. The sake was simple, but the flavors were oily and sweet. I really liked the shrimp. The shrimp head was fried and so flavorful and meaty. I didn't like the tamago at all. It was a strange sweetness that just didn't fit my palate. The foie gras and scallop was good and I liked the on their own, but not together. The foie gras is very heavy and meaty so its flavor overpowered the freshness of the scallop.
