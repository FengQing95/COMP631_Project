Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I have been to Bosscat a few times for brunch and the food was superb! Delicious cocktails, amazing food that tastes as good as it looks. Last weekend, I went for Â a special birthday dinner in the Whiskey Room. Private, sexy, and intimate ambiance for a small gathering of good friends. We tried several different whiskeys, surrounded by some of the best bottles in the world! The dinner menu is just as good as their brunch. We tried some of everything and loved every single bite! Also, I can't say enough good things about our server Henry. Our friend, Jeremy also gave us the menu rundown and pointed us to some of his favorites and did not disappoint. Service was impeccable and the food was too! Can't wait to go back for both dinner and libations! This is 5 stars all the way! Great place for groups and celebrations!
