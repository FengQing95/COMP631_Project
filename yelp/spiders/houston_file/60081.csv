Baby Barnaby's////Anyways my complaints that dropped what was an easy 4 or 5 star place down is the wait.  I understand this place is tiny but there's got to be some better way of setting up the waitlist.  We waited almost 45 minutes for a table and then we squeezed into a small tiny booth which made some of our group eat like T-Rexs.
