Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got the pancake flight and tried the pancake of the day (white chocolate chip pancake), chocolate chip, pineapple, sweet potato, peanut butter, and blueberry. My least favorite were sweet potato and pineapple but the pineapple was probably because I saved it for the end and was so full. These are very sweet, so treat them as desserts! My favorite was peanut butter, chocolate chip, and pancake of the day. Honestly, all the pancakes were great, even the ones that were my least favorite!!
