Local Foods////Love this concept! The food is fresh and flavorful. The egg salad and crunchy chicken are a must try, as well as the Kale Salad. You get your moneys worth and the service is always friendly and quite fast for the size of the crowd some days. You will not be disappointed if you are searching for a healthy, unique meal.
