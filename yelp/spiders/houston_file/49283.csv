Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I loved this breakfast place! I came in 1030am on a Wednesday and had to wait maybe 5-10min. for a table. Its a small but cute restaurant with great food, drinks and prices. Ive already recommended this place to a couple of people and I will definitely be back myself! I got the Chilaquiles Benedict for about $11 and it was amazing! I had a side order of one Pineapple Upside Down Cake pancake for $4.50. I had too much to eat but it was worth the variety of flavors! Everyone at the table loved their meals!
