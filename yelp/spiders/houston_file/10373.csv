JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the chef's special spicy tonkotsu ramen and added a seasoned egg. The broth wasn't too thick which was a nice change to the starchy thick pork broths at other places. The flavor was savory with just enough spice. The extra egg was soft boiled and seasoned to perfection. Overall, a great dining experience and excellent tasting food.
