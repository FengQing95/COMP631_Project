Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We had a great experience at Bosscat. We were in town visiting from NY. From the service to the food to the atmosphere everything was great. We especially enjoyed the live music playing acoustic pop hits. We had the best experience thanks to Terry and Jose!!!! PS order the king and fruity pebble French toast as appetizers! They were excellent!!
