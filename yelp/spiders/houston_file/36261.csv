Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A must visit here in Houston. We ordered the chorizo and Benedict, sticky bun burger, short rib chilaquiles and bosscat fries. Food came out quick, even with a full house and food was hot. James our waiter was excellent, very attentive. Most important, all the waiters have a great teamwork system.
