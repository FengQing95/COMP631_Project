Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visited this location twice while on vacation! The wait could be up to an hour at times, but very worth it. If your party is small enough, opt for seats at the bar which is first come, first served. The menu has a wide variety, whatever you choose, you can't go wrong! The ambiance is relaxed yet professional. Our favorite options were the "Sandwich I Am" with pretzel bun and the "Benny Goodman" lox and cream cheese eggs Benedict. Parking very limited.
