JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You also mentioned that you felt your food was rushed. Were your ramen and/or tapas brought out too quickly? The majority of our tapas are fried; therefore, it's important to serve them as soon as they come out of the fryer. The same goes for our ramen: We try to serve our bowls as soon as the chefs finish preparing the toppings. Unlike a lot of restaurants or dining concepts, we don't have heating lamps or heating elements to preserve the temperature of our food once the chef has prepared them. We have to bring them to our customers as quickly as possible as no one wants a lukewarm bowl of soup.
