The Pit Room////Brisket and turkey are definitely the star of the show.  Our party ordered the Feast #1 which came with 1 lb. brisket, 1/4 turkey, 1 jalapeño sausage link, 1 venison sausage link, 4 pork ribs, 1 beef rib and 1/4 lb. pulled pork - which we subbed for chicken..... All for $90 not inclusive of drinks.  Most of the meat was dry except for the brisket and turkey, both of which were very moist.  Our biggest gripe was the 4 super small individually sized side dishes they paired with our huge "family sized" meal.  If they actually gave pint sized sides, they would definitely be a 4 star restaurant.  When we saw another patron with large sides, we asked the manager if they had made a mistake with ours - but she politely smiled and said "No."
