Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This bakery is outstanding. The line out the door is justified and moves quickly. We didn't witness customers saving tables before their order, so finding a table wasn't difficult. We scored one outside on a lovely Sunday morning. We enjoyed a heavenly chocolate croissant and their famous, crazy-good Kugelhopf. The macarons we took to-go were outstanding also.
