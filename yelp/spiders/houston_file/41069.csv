Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have only written a couple of reviews ever, but I am compelled to write a review for Common Bond because it was truly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. If you are considering going...GO NOW! Everything at the bakery is perfection...from the bread, to the pastries (try the kugelhopf or the almond croussant), to the amazing lunch. Chef Roy is a gift to this city, and Common Bond makes me proud to be a Houstonian!
