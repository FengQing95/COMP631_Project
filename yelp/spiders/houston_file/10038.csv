JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////What a nice place! I love the ambiance and the music they played. I went with a girlfriend and we got the takoyaki, which we both enjoyed! Tip: Do not stick the entire thing in your mouth. It was so hot when I got it (duh) so I couldn't enjoy my first one since I was too busy trying to air out my mouth.
