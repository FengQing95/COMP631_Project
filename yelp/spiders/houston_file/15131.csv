JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wow!!!! What can I say. Definitely some of the most flavorful Ramen I've had EVER! We went as a party of 3 and we're seated in an interesting community table so we were all 3 seated next to each other and across from people we didn't know. If you prefer a booth or regular table, mention that when you arrive!
