Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Little did I know there were MORE baked goods later on, cakes and macarons! I had the fig & something macaron as well as the tiramisu one. Meringues were baked perfectly for both and the buttercream was nice and delicately sweet. Great job. Pricing for the baked goods was fair in my eyes.
