Uchi////For appetizers we had all of my favorites: Machi Cure- Smoked yellow Tail, Yuca Crisp, and Marcona Almond. I love the crunchy taste from the thin sliced fried yuca chips. Hama Chili- Yellowtail, Ponzu, Thai Chili, and Orange Supreme. I'm a BIG fan of fruit infused dishes. Yellowtail was very fresh and the oranges were juicy with every bite! Last appetizer was the Brussel Sprouts- Lemon and Chili. Deliciously flavorful glaze and crispy on the outside. I know not many people like brussel sprouts, but Uchi's is worth a try.
