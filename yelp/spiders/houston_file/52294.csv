Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Just needed to stop in to get a quick breakfast. The wait wasn't too long so we stopped here. The staff were very friendly and the restaurant was clean. It was very cold this day but the restaurant was cold as well. I ate my breakfast with my jacket on....I wasn't the most comfortable doing so. I ordered a side of fruit due to me being so hungry. I wanted it before my food came out but it took about 20 min for me to get it. Maybe the kitchen was backed up, it shouldn't have taken that long and I had to ask about it. My food was ok, presentation was amazing. Everything that came out really looked good! But my toast was barely toasted and my bacon was salty. But the hash browns were pretty tasty
