Local Foods////Their sandwiches come with two sides so I tried the House Smoked Salmon with local greens, onion jam, in a poppy bagel and my two sides were cous cous (with pickled shaved carrots and veggies) and Tuscan kale (with golden raisins, toasted pine nuts, parmesan).  All of this freshness was a little over $11. The Tuscan kale was absolutely AMAZING with beautiful green kale and a touch of sweetness from the golden raisins and some crunch from the pine nuts.  The parmesan cheese was light and helped mix everything together well.  The cous cous had a little too much carrots for my liking, but it was very tasty and delicious.  The smoked salmon sandwich was AMAZING.  Imagine this...crunch from the perfectly toasted poppy bagel + fluffy cream cheese + smokey taste of salmon + cool greens + juicy and sweet onion jam...all in one bite.  Heaven.
