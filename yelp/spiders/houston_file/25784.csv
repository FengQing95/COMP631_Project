The Pit Room////I ordered the brisket dinner, macaroni & cheese, beans, and cherry pie. The brisket was phenomenal! Juicy, very smokey with scrumptious burnt ends... I never wanted it to end! The beans were delicious, a little spicy, and a good side dish for the brisket. The mac & cheese was a disgrace. They should stop serving it or use someone's grandmother's recipe for crying out loud! I recommend that you stay away from the mac & cheese, unless you look at it first. My order was placed over the phone. Had I witnessed the macaroni sitting in the thin cheese water sauce, I would not have ordered it. Moving on to a brighter note... The cherry pie... *shakes head with eyes closed* I've never been disappointed by cherry pie, and this one was extra special! The topping was a little crumbly and sweet. The cherries were perfect & packed into my portion. The crust was sturdy & there was enough to capture a piece in every bite from start to finish. I LOOOOVE pie crust! My only regret is not having whipped cream on top of the pie. The next time I travel to Houston, which should be in a few months, I'll be back!
