Kata Robata////SUSHI: The sushi here is just great. I really enjoy nigiri, and the pieces here are always full and fresh! Some of my favorites are the chu toro, Santa Barbara uni, and anago. It ain't cheap, but it sure hits the spot! The rolls aren't bad, either. I think they have the best tasting spider roll in town (which happens to be on the Happy Hour menu as well!)
