Uchi////I was not as impressed by Uchi as the one in Austin (Uchiko). Location: near downtown, since I am not a fan of noisy crowds, I would say I like Uchiko better, which is also located near downtown but in a quiet neighborhood. Space: the entrance is beautiful but interior is just not as special; seatings are a little bit too packed. Service: ok, as you would expected in this type of restaurant. Food: presentation is not very good, the sushis we ordered look a little bit sloppy, I mean, each piece costs at least 3-4 dollars, but the fish pieces look broken and are sloped... Taste is ok, similar to Uchiko, we really like the ham and egg rolls. The unagi, foie gras, and salmon toro sushi taste good, too. The karrage was just a disaster though, why do you cover the fried chicken with such salty heavy sauce? Hubby and I drank so much water while we were eating the karrage... The hamachi nabe is a good idea but the hamachi inside tastes too ordinary. Anyway, still a great fancy Japanese restaurant to try out in the Houston area, but considering the prices, it is not perfect in many ways.
