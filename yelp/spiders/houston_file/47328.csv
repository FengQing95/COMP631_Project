Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My boyfriends and I's experience here was an absolute delight. The food was amazing and everything on the menu sounded spectacular. It was genuinely hard to choose what to order. We settled on eggs Benedict and he pot pie dish. Our waitress was an absolute delight and provided us with a complementary pancake since it was our first time visiting. She was very cordial and friendly. We absolutely will be visiting again and I think I can safely say that this is our favorite breakfast/brunch place to date.
