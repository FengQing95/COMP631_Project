Baby Barnaby's////These guys serve some of the best breakfast in town! Such a friendly environment and the employees make you feel like you are at home! Very pleasant vibes with just awesome food! I got the chicken fried steak with eggs and potatoes for breakfast and was extremely happy with it! The prices are also good and affordable
