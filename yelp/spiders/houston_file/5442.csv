JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Uh, are you telling me that I can get a good bowl of ramen at a place that's just 10 minutes away from work? Um. heck. yeah. I've been here several times and it's been a great experience each time. I've usually come on weekdays during lunch hour, and I've never had to wait for a table. The ambiance is very welcoming, or  in my coworkers own words, "very cool".  There are large communal tables, to private booths, and a bar, so there is plenty of seating.
