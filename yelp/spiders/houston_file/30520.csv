The Pit Room////Holy mother of barbecue, I'm in heaven and I never want to leave. Best bbq I've ever had. Wowzers! The Mac and cheese (best ever) is made with queso and absolutely amazing. The okra is cooked perfectly with just the right seasoning. The meats...oh the meats. My man and I shared a 3-meat platter and we're full. Ate the whole thing, and getting a platter to go. The Czech sausages were legit!
