Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////although very photogenic and cooked to perfection (they got the hash browns spot-on!)  the food was ice-cold and bland, and the coffee was stale (tasted like expired office coffee improperly stored).  it looked perfect but it had ZERO taste.  i don't know how long the plate was sitting on the counter.  maybe try warming the plates up before serving?  i thought most places have heat lamps for this very reason?
