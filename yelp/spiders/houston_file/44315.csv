Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The macaron was actually probably one of the best macarons I've had - it was just crunchy enough to give texture yet soft enough to savor each bite without chomping down on jagged pieces of cookie. The kugelhopf, on the other hand, was so unmemorable. It had an orange blossom flavor (which was pretty good), but it was vaguely sweet, and it just desperately needed a sauce or drizzle or SOMETHING because it was so dry.
