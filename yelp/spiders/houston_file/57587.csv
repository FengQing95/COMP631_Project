Kata Robata////The Wagyu beef sandos are a must try, the lobster mac was rich and delicious, and all of my nigiri was fresh and yummy. I also had two of their signature rolls, the ocean picante and tropical spicy tuna and they did not disappoint. I would definitely order takeout from here again, and a huge plus is that they quote you about 15 minutes from your order being placed, and they are pretty close to that already short window which is awesome!
