Uchi////We ended up having a long dinner, so I needed to use the restroom during this time. I found it entirely disturbing that they "share" the restrooms with the coffeehouse next door to them. I would have thought a restaurant like this would have been able to afford to build their own restrooms. It felt very awkward to walk into a community hallway to find community bathrooms. This was very odd and I didn't very much care for it.
