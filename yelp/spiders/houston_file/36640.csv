Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////At the end of the day, we're a small family oriented operation. We work hard everyday to make sure we put the best possible food out for our guests. Even with all that effort sometimes we'll miss the mark. Which seems to be the case with your visit. On behalf of our entire team here I want to apologize for not meeting your expectations.
