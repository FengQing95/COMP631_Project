Baby Barnaby's////What we have here folks is something many restaurants could learn a lesson from: what Baby Barnaby's does, what keeps 'em coming back, is simple food made using quality ingredients, done right. It's not magic, it's not rocket science, but as rare as it's become, it seems an age old lesson has been lost in modern translation. Baby Barnaby's brings back age old traditions but with a modern, friendly attitude. It's the best of both worlds.
