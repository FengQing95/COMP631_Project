Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We put our names down around 10:30 and got seated at around 12 pm. This place is definitely worth the wait. We ordered some of the signature coffees. As far as the main course, we ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie and some Breakfast tacos! Both were really good with some Yellowbird sauce that is made in Austin, Tx! The service was good as well, understanding that they do get pretty busy. Follow me @houstoneats on instagram.
