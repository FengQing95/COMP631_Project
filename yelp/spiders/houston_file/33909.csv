Local Foods////The sandwiches are good, but I really enjoy the sides.  Simple things that are put together well.  It may not seem like you are getting alot of food, but the ingredients are dense and filling, especially the kale.  Ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich based on past reviews.  The service was fast and friendly from the cashier and made good recommendations as it was my first time here.
