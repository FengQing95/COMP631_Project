Local Foods////I always forget about this place, which is strange since it's so good! The food always tastes fresh, which is a big plus. I always get the pastrami and really enjoy it. Â I think I enjoyed the salt and pepper roast beef more, but they removed it from the menu, unfortunately. I think the ambiance in the restaurant is quite nice, although you will have to potentially share a table, especially if the place is crowded. Parking is sort of a nightmare, but I think that's pretty much the norm for anything in Rice Village.
