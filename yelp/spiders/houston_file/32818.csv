Local Foods////Because my friend and I were deep in conversation, I didn't notice that my food was taking a little longer. So, when they brought my order, I was just happy to dig in, not perturbed at all by the wait. Just a few minutes later, one of the managers came by, apologized for the wait (which I hardly noticed), and gave me a "free lunch" card to use for next time. It felt like Christmas came early!!
