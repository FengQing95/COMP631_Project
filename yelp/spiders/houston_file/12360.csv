JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the tonkotsu black ramen and my boyfriend got the tonkotsu spicy. I would definitely not recommend the tonkotsu black if you're on your first date. That being said it was sooooooo good. It was pure garlic heaven! My poor boyfriend had to deal with my garlic aroma the whole way back home!! Haha!! The tonkotsu was alright, it was just your typical ramen bowl. It's a good starter if you're new to ramen.
