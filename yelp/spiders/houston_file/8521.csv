JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Jasmine - Thank you for your review. Upon reading, I immediately spoke to the hosts on duty and confiscated their phones. Inattentive service is wholly unacceptable, and I appreciate your bringing this to my attention. I have also spoken to my servers to ensure that they are checking-in on tables consistently. Unfortunately, when we get busy, the entire staff gets pulled in a dozen directions simultaneously, but it's still no excuse for bad service.
