The Pit Room////We ordered a 2 meat dinner with pork ribs and brisket with double mac n cheese and then ordered a beef rib with mac n cheese and potato salad a la carte (beef rib doesn't come as the dinner options - they charge you per pound instead). We actually got the last beef rib and i was super excited, but when i saw it, I was pretty disappointed. There was not that much meat and the meat was on the bone was dry and tough... it was not moist and it did not fall off the bone like all the other beef briskets I've had. The pork ribs were good and the beef brisket was good too although it could've been more moist as well.
