JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Long awaited JINYA. Finally went some friends on a weekday night and there was still a wait (they don't take reservations)! But it passed quickly enough. We all ordered their special black ramen and it was very tasty and rich. However, with tax and tip and everything it comes out to 17$, which I don't think is worth. Also, the restuarant is waayy too dark in my opinion. I will come back if I have a hankering for ramen and the good packs from the Asian grocery store won't do. Not bad, just pricey.
