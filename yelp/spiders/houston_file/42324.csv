Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their baguettes and coffee are really good! It's troubling however that even though they're only 1mi from Buffalo Bayou park, there is no bicycle parking! They could really capture a lot more folks bicycling from the park if they just purchased a bicycle rack. We skip out a lot of the time and go to HEB for the bread simply because we have somewhere safe to lock up.
