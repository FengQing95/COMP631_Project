Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I also had the Spring has sprung frittata which was my light and the green healthy order, Cz you know.... I tried bites of the Juan's tacos which were good. The drinks were a disappointment. I ordered the Snooze fashioned which just did the complete opp of awesome to my taste buds. One sip and the drink had to be tucked away into the farthest corner of our table. The dirty drinker chai was nice though. We tried the ginger spiced version of the chai as opposed to the sweeter one. It was really nice.
