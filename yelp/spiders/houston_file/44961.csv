Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The atmosphere is nice as well. It's a place you want to hangout in. It's cool and mellow, with indoor seating at bars, communal tables, or booths. You can sit outside too, taking in the busy street corner of Westheimer and Dunlavy. The line does get long, but it flows and it's definitely worth the wait! Despite the line, I've never had trouble finding seating. The servers are courteous and the place is clean and neat. Can't ask for more. It's the perfect bakery/cafe!
