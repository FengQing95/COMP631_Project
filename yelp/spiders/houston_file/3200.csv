JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is the first time I've ever gone out seeking ramen for dinner, and I gotta say I'm impressed. No wait, even in the afternoon. Friendly staff, and their veggie ramen is incredible. Great atmosphere too, but I'm gonna knock a star just because I wish it was less loud and the single giant table in the center was replaced with several smaller tables.
