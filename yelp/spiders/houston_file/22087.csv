Uchi////If you've been to a Tapas, expect this place to be the Japanese version. I'd suggest that for the first time you come here to go ahead and get the Chef's Selection (if you're okay with surprising food). You'll actually get full if you ask the waiter to recommend the portion or course size for you and it comes with a dessert of your choosing. If you're just choosing your own food then I suggest the chef's nigiri selection: Akima Tuna, Sake Toro, Hamachi and 2 other Nigiris I can't quite remember. Also the Foie Gras is something you DON'T want to miss out on. Our waiter Oscar was very helpful! Dessert wise, I suggest you try the Fried Milk; it's what everyone talks about on the Yelp reviews but now I know why. I also got the Cantaloupe and it was very refreshing and a real palate cleanser. Hoping to come back again!
