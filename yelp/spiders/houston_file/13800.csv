JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We got here at like 10pm on a Monday but the place was still hopping.  We got great service with plenty of good recommendations.  The atmosphere was really cool with a laid back but intimate, maybe even somewhat romantic, vibe to it.  I could see hanging here with a group of friends or coming here on a date.
