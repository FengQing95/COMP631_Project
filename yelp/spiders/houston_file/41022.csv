Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is amazing! Indoor and outdoor seating options, we opted to sit outside. Our waiter Jerry was extremely knowledgeable, personable and attentive. We didn't wait long on anything the throes time. The bed and breakfast shot comes with bacon and is absolutely smooth and delicious. The chicken fried steak was perfectly made and extremely filling (can definitely be for 2 people). The shrimp and grits was yummy with just enough kick and fill of flavor. When I'm Houston, this will forever be a go-to place from
