Kata Robata////So what waits Kata Robata in a near future. ? Kata Robata will need to decide whether this is going to be a routine menu as part of their Sushi and Grill operation. From the ramen perspective, It would be nice to increase the topping options. Or even have Kaedama. But, I am asking too much because at the end Kata Robata's main discipline is in Sushi and Robata. For sure Today is a day to celebrate the born of the highest quality Ramen in Houston.
