Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is my second time here and it was excellent as usual! My only recommendation is getting there EARLY if you don't want to wait. (Before 8:30am) This time I got their breakfast Pot Pie which is eggs served your way over sausage gravy and hash browns laying on a delicious flaky dough crust shell....all the textures and flavors are perfect! Another great thing about the Montrose location is that I have never seen children in there! I mean I kind of love my niece and nephew but don't want to eat around loud, fidgety kids anytime, but especially in the morning! Also, tell your server its your first time there....we got a free pancake on the side and it was amazing!
