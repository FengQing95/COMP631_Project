Kata Robata////Wow. Just wow. Not sure how this place can get an average of four stars because the service and food were off the charts. My daughter and I are pretty avid sushi eaters and something we l've learned is that good fresh fish is key but rice is nearly always overlooked. Not so at our favorite sushi place back in Victoria, Canada and not so at Kata Robata. There is a genuine focus on sourcing high quality rice and preparing it properly, then serving it fresh.
