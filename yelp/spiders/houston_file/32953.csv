Local Foods////I've only been here once, but they had a fall seasonal salad that was like reading your favorite book for the first time. It had every ingredient I love, like butternut squash, roasted brussels sprouts, beets, mixed greens, pumpkin seeds, etc. Parking is a little tricky, but a nice joint overall.
