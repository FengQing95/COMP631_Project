JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So it's safe to say, this place was looking to be the spot for me. I had no doubt the ramen was going to be good! But I was a bit wrong. Not completely wrong, just slightly. The noodles came out a bit over cooked, the miso broth was not that flavorful. I had to add in some of the sauce they provide, but it wasn't the same. But it wasn't bad. It was pretty decent. I would say I like Tiger Den's spicy pork ramen better though. The spicy ground pork here was a good spice but I just wasn't feeling it. Now, the egg, was a bit of a let down. It wasn't as running as I hoped it to be.
