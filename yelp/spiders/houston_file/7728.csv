JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only issue I had was with the parking arrangement.  There is a garage behind the building that is shared with the other businesses in the building.  They have valet which is fine.  But I take issue when the landlord/tenants allow valets to hijack all the best available parking (which is sitting empty) leaving few available spaces for self-parkers.  This is not unique, but unfortunately an epidemic among restaurants in Houston.  What happened to the day when valets actually ran to the back to get your car?  Doesn't take away from the food or dining experience, but think it's worth consideration.
