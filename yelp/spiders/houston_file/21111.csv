Uchi////There were a few sushi courses that followed.  Most, like the scallop, had too much prominence of one flavor in particular masking the fish/shellfish (in the case of the scallops, the ginger was very heavy handed).  I'm not sure if it is supposed to taste like this or not, but the Bonito was extremely fishy.
