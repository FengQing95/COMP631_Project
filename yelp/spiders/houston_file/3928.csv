JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Marie - Thanks for your review. The Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen is one of our more costly dishes due to the specialized miso paste that we use, as well as the number of toppings and amount of pork that goes into this partcular bowl. As a franchise, we don't create our recipes and must adhere to the ingredients and methods of preparation handed down to us by our Los Angeles headquarters. Regardless, we are grateful for your continued patronage, and we hope to serve you again soon.
