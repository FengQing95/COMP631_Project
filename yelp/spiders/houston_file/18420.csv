Uchi////The food, the service, the environment. All amazing. The service here was one of my best experiences in Houston. Our cups were never empty and the waiter knew every dish when we had questions. My cousin and I did the Chef's Tastings, which is a 10 course meal of various tastings they offer on the menu or on their daily menu. Every single tasting was delicious. The waiter told us how to eat each meal (eat it upside down, eat with your fingers, eat it all in one bite, etc.). Even though the ingredients seem so simple, the dishes were executed perfectly. All the ingredients were paired impeccably. My favorites were the foie gras, the scallops, the pork belly, and the escolar. The pork belly and escolar were nicely seared and was dressed with a complementing sauce. The foie gras, also dressed with a sauce and in sushi form, melted in my mouth. This is one restaurant to come to for the food, the experience, and the environment. Do not come here thinking about money, just order. I would come back here for the Chef's Tastings or get one of everything on the regular menu.
