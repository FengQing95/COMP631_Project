Uchi////A 5 star restaurant at a 5 star price.  You do not have to dress 5 star.  Casual dress is acceptable.  Food is excellent, probably the best in the city for Japanese style cuisine.  The portions are Japanese style.  Small and expensive.  Loved it.  The service was excellent when I went as well.
