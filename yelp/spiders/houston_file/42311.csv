Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I'll explain the missing star in a bit. Because quite frankly I LOVE this place. They make the best pastries around town. My favorite is Kouign Amman and their fruit croissants! Such flaky, buttery goodness! I've tried several others of their sweet confections and they are all good. I've recommended this place to oh so many people. So why the missing star? Well, when they first opened their fruit croissants were HUGE and had edible gold leaf!!!!!! It was such a decadent dessert and I loved it. Now their croissants are more sedately sized and the gold leaf is gone. So perhaps if they bring it back I'll update the review with the missing star.
