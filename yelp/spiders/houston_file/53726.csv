Kata Robata////That being said, the food was quite good.  I had the salmon bento box which has some incredibly fresh salmon.  But the best parts were the miso dressing on the salad--the word "miso" was about the only thing Japanese about it though--and the teriyaki chicken:  great teriyaki flavor with a slight crispiness on the outside (though a touch on the dry side).  The seaweed and tofu in the bento box were both fairly mediocre--nothing that stood out compared to what I've had at other Japanese restaurants.  The spicy tuna roll that we ordered was good, but definitely should not have been called "spicy."
