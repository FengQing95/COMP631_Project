Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place seems very popular, particularly on weekends. We had about an hour wait, but they take your number and text you close to your time. There are a few spots close by to kill time though, we went to a coffee shop. When we returned, we noticed they have complimentary coffee up front...derp.
