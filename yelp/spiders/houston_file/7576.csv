JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi June - Thanks for your great review. I'm glad you were able to get seated without a wait on the weekend. Although we definitely have peak hours, there are times when a party of 2-4 people can get seated immediately, though it's nearly impossible to predict the timing on that. I think it has something to do with what happens when you walk into a Walgreen's and just as you finish browsing and approach the register, every single person in the store decides to do the same.
