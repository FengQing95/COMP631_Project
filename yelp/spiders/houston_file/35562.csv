Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////As for our flight selections, I want to make sure you weren't misinformed. We actually have 2 bourbon flights, 2 scotch flights , and 1 Japanese flight. They're all listed in the back of our whiskey book. However, you can create a flight from any of our 280 bottles. Just let us know which ones you want to taste. We'll set you up with three 1oz pour of the chosen whiskies. The cost is just half of what a regular shot would be.
