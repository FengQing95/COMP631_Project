JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I specifically ordered my appetizer and ramen at separate times and told him that I'd like them to come out separately. They came out together. Ok, a pet peeve but not the end of the world. We just scarfed down the gyoza before our ramen had time to completely cool off.
