Local Foods////- "Banh Mi": Okay, so I've held off on trying this sandwich until very recently. Why spend $11.50 on a banh mi, I thought, when I can buy a legit one for $2.50 from Midtown? But, I reasoned, if I'm going to write a review about Local Foods, I should have it once so I can credibly tell people to pass on it. The joke was on me though, because the banh mi is quite delicious. And to be fair, Local Foods doesn't claim that it's traditional; they put it in quotation marks on the menu. So get the banh mi if you're craving pork or want to try Local Foods' interpretation of the classic.
