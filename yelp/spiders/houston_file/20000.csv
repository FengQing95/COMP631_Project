Uchi////Honestly I think this place is overrated. I came here because traffic prevented me from going to Miyagi - best authentic Japanese Sushi restaurant in Houston in my mind. I was hoping for a mind-blowing experience because of all the Yelp reviews and the ravings from my coworkers, but left disappointed. If you are looking for authentic Japanese food, do not come here! It's at most a trendy Japanese-fusion restaurant. Major chefs are non Japanese and sushi/rolls are prepared in a pretty western way.
