JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hey. I like this ramen place. I love me some thick noodles and broth mmm. Usually, i just get something random and it always ends up tasting great. Personally, just wished there was more meat! Great ramen, fair price, and solid atmosphere.Needless to say... check this place out if you like ramen. Like now.
