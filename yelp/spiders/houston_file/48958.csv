Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Alright, alright, alright.  The food of this place lives up to the hype.  The wait however, is ridiculous! However, on my particular visit, I got to bypass the line, because we ran into some friends that had placed their name on the list and had already waited over an hr.  So we were seated with them pretty quickly.  I gladly paid for their brunch as it saved us the wait.
