Kata Robata////The toro was absolutely amazing. They were so fresh, light, and felt like they melted in your mouth, the sake was buttery and so smooth, the tuna wasn't fishy at all and tasted so simple, but so fresh, and the spicy chopped scallop was the perfect consistency.. not too mushy and not too hard. There wasn't much spice, but the flavors were there.
