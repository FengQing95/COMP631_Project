Uchi////I went in January with my boyfriend for his birthday. We always wanted to try this place out, but never got the chance so we took this opportunity to do so. We were immediately greeted at the door with samples and taken to our table. Our server was very prompt and friendly. She described everything in detail and knew the menu inside out.
