The Pit Room////Jalapeño Cheddar Sausage - really good, the sausage is made in house fresh everyday.  Its texture is coarse which is a major plus, and the cheese oozes out when it's freshly cut.  I make sausage from scratch with my bf and his family so we are very particular when it comes to texture, taste, and smokiness.  This one takes the cake!
