Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Our waitress was SO nice, very helpful, and gave us a couple of dishes on the house.  Service was excellent, and I have no complaints whatsoever.  Luckily, our server informed us that we could get half orders of some of the dishes, which allowed us to try so many more things on the menu.
