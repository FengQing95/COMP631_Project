Baby Barnaby's////I went there on a beautiful Sunday for brunch and it was a great experience. I loved the freshly squeezedorange juice and coffee. The service was very friendly. The food was great. I liked the pink eggs. Their fruit flavored pancake is a great choice as well. I tried the Apple Pecan and it's definitely not your ordinary pancakes. Overall, it's a good spot for brunch. The only bad thing is that if you don't get there early enough, you may have to wait for quite a while, like we did. They do have coffee and newspaper to make the wait easier.
