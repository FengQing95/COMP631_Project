Uchi////Now, to the really experimental items. Our sushi chef, Daniel brought out a yellowtail sample with what I remember was a yuzu vinegrette and small slivers of oranges. It was almost a quick ceviche, with the high acidity of the yuzu briefly curing the fish and the orange balancing out with its sweetness. Again, there is a fine balance between how the fish's inherent flavor and slightly "with bite" texture is retained while being accentuated by the acid and sweetness.
