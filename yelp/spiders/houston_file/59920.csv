Baby Barnaby's////This place has the worst customer service that you will ever experience in houston. If you're not a regular, they don't give you priority. They also gave us nasty looks at me and my friends which we really felt super Â uncomfortable about. Not only that, but the whole restaurent was slanted and it was extremely uncomfortable especially because we were sitting next to an old school air conditioner filled with dust. The overall atmosphere is just unwelcoming. I would definitely never comeback here again.
