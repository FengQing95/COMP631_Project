Local Foods////This is the perfect lunch spot. The food is unpretentious and so yummy. I love that they support local farmers and ingredients. The portions are huge... you really can share. I have to echo all the people who enjoyed the truffle egg salad sandwich... it is so goood. You can't go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. I also recommend the shrimp and crab sandwich, beets, and kale. I enjoyed the laid back ambiance of this place. Great for quick bite to eat and nice conversation.
