The Pit Room////Best BBQ I have ever had! We came around 7:45 on a Sunday evening and the line was still out the door. We had 2 kids with us so were dubious about waiting but the line but wow am I glad we stayed! I got brisket and a pork rib-- both were excellent and so wonderfully seasoned that they really didn't need sauce at all-- though the sauce was great too. The coleslaw was fresh and not overdressed. Service was fast and friendly. My only complaint was that many people grab empty tables while the rest of their party is in line, so we were standing there with trays of delicious food and half of the tables were full of people "saving the table" for people at the end of a long line. A regular saw my exasperation and told me that people were really not supposed to be doing this. Luckily, someone saving a table must have overheard him, and she took pity on me, my 2 little kids, and my huge tray of delicious food and said we could have the table. Phew! Crisis averted! A small sign telling people not to sit at the tables until they have their food would possibly help, but maybe not, because you know how some people are. I was going to get take out for my husband but decided I'd rather come back with him, as soon as possible.
