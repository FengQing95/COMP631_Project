Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I rarely make it out to bars or restaurants nowadays with kids, but when I do, I definitely make it a point to go to Bosscat, their selection is out of this world, great atmosphere and the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys great food, and smooth drinks!
