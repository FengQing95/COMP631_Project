JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Wait: There was a short wait when I came here for the first time for Sunday lunch. However, we waited for a party of 10 so waiting for 10 spaces to open up did take longer than if you're just coming here by yourself (you could sit at the bar) or if you're in a party of four or less.
