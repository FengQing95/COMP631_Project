Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had the bosscat burger the chefs way (includes grilled onions, jalape√±o aoli, lettuce, and pickles. My wife had the same thing but not chefs way. Our little one had an apple crostada with vanilla ice cream. The burgers are ala carte so we ordered a side of fries. The food came out in a fair time but the waitress forgot to order our fries. I got through half of my burger before getting them. The burger was delicious. Meat was well seasoned and the aoli had the right amount of kick. The fries are homemade and bigger than steak steak fries and well with sea salt.
