Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've heard stories about the ridiculous wait times here, but fortunately we didn't experience that given how early on a Sunday morning we arrived. We came around 10 am and were given a table after a 20 minute wait. We'd already made our brunch selections and were in a bit of a hurry, so we ordered immediately on being seated.
