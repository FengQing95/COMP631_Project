Kata Robata////I love kata robata! Their 72 hours beef skewers are to die for! They literally melt in your mouth. The lobster Mac and cheese is also amazing! Normally I get tired of eating Mac and cheese after a few bite, but this is so good I just want more! The miso bone marrow is delicious. Very rich. The pan seared u-turn scallops are good too but the portion is not that big. I also enjoyed the Hawaiian amberjack with foie gras but I'm not sure if that's still on the menu or not. The ambiance is romantic and nice. The servers are always attentive and nice. The hostess are very friendly.
