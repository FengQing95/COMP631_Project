Uchi////Their food is thoughtful, inventive, and just delightful. If only every restaurant could evoke so much joy! Uchi really reminds me what I enjoy about food: appreciating the small details of a dish, interesting and new flavor combinations, and even the emotions food can bring up (nostalgia, child like wonder).
