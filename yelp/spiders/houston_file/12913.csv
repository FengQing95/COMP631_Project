JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Went to this place on a Friday nights at 7:30 and the wait was 1 hour. First time trying it so might as well wait. The restaurant is really small, kind of given since it is located in downtown. But the ramen definitely worth the wait, it was so good, I can see why the locals think this is the best ramen restaurant in town. Definitely will try their other location in town, maybe shorter wait time.
