Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It pains me to deduct a star from my previous review and then some. I have been here several times since my original review in 2014 and I have had stellar brunches here that were totally worth five stars but then there have been equally as many times where I had pastry items that were several notches below so-so.
