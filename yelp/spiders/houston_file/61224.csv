Baby Barnaby's////I love Barnabys. Good food that seems to have a healthier twist to it. The reason for 4 stars is they are sometimes inconsistent between locations. I got this one salad with the sumac chicken (forgot the name) but absolutely loved that it had mint in it, it was so refreshing. Went to another location and ordered it and they forgot the mint :( but overall great food. The queso, burgers, breakfast, salads are all great. A little pricey but I feel that's just normal for going out now. Idk when 12-16$ because normal for a salad but it has happened.
