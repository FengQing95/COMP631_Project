Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Well worth the wait, the food is definitely one of a kind. I order the spud deluxe with onions and barbacoa, it was fantastic. The porridge is a must,the texture alone will put you on a different level. The cinnamon pancake was my favorite out of all the pancakes.(off the menu item) The snooze pot pie was awesome as well,just melts in your mouth. I wish I could try the whole menu in one sitting. Atmosphere is layed back fits in perfect in the montrose area.
