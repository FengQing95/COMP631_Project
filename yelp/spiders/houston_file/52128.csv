Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place was great. Super packed with a bit of a wait but if you call ahead it's not bad. Food was awesome w/ large portions. We had some errors on one of our plates but it was fixed in a timely and professional manner. Cocktails are delicious as well! Our waitress was super friendly helpful and funny! We will definitely be back!
