Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I think my issue with Common Bond is that it's so hard for places that get SUPER hyped up to meet my expectations.  So when I hear things like "best croissant ever" that is what I expect!  To be fair, their chocolate croissant is really really good.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The chocolate filling was alright, albeit a little too thick and hard.  I would have preferred a chocolate filling with something like the consistency of Nutella.  However, with that almost $5 price and the fact that it's not very healthy for you, I don't think I'd be indulging in it  very often.
