Baby Barnaby's////The minute I walked in I knew that I came to the right place for a great breakfast. Friendly staff, fresh squeezed oj and delectable menu choices. The green eggs with chicken sausage are awesome (think breakfast spinach dip). Everything that makes breakfast a breakfast, kicked up a notch. To top it off the prices are very reasonable! 4.5 stars because they need bloody marys to make it perfect.
