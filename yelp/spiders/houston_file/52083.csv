Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is super busy for brunch on weekends but definitely worth the wait. Thankfully, we joined the waitlist online before we headed over and only had to wait about 15 minutes (about as long as it took to find parking) once we arrived. Our waitress Erykah was awesome and made great recommendations. She was so friendly and welcoming, made sure we were satisfied with our meals and engaged with our daughter to get some giggles out of her. My husband had eggs, chicken sausage, grits and Funky Monkey French toast. Omg that French toast, delish! Our daughter devoured her chocolate chip pancake. I had the sweet potato veggie smash up, light on the calories but full of flavor. We washed it all down with a rummosa and a brewmosa. Great brunch!
