Local Foods////The only points that I would take off is the parking and seating, which gets crowded fast. In addition, I didn't quite like the sides. I got the lemon pepper chicken soup for the side, but I find the taste not very appealing and somewhat even flat. The other sides on the menu also doesn't impress me much.
