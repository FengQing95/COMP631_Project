Uchi////jar jar duck - countryside farms duck, kumquat, endive, rosemary smoke: smoke smells an awful lot like weed (ahem or so I heard)... but once you get past it all the duck deliciousness comes through. Duck is tender and rich, endive is pickled for acidity, the kumquat is small but a perfect bright spot at the end of the bite.
