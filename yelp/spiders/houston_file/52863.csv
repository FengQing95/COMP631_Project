Kata Robata////Came here for a birthday party on a Friday night and we had reservations because there were 7 of us but I saw plenty of open tables at 7:30. My friend and I were the first to arrive and the hostess sat us immediately - seating incomplete parties is usually unheard of so we were off to a good start already.
