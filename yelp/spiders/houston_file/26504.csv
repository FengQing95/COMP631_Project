The Pit Room////Got the two meat choice plate with two sides.  The meal was ok, both porks ribs and beef brisket is a little dry for my liking.  Service was really good and they keep everybody moving during lunch hour.  Parking was hard to find due the current road construction. Probably won't be coming back.
