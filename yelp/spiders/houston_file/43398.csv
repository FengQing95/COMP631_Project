Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Theres already so many reviews of this place and yet I didn't believe them. I was thinking that this would just be another super cute Montrose place that was over-priced and over-hyped. But, I couldn't resist an invitation from my friend to meet her here, so after some time finding parking, I finally entered this small piece of Heaven.
