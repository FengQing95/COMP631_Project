The Pit Room////The portions are large, but I did find the price a little steep compared to other BBQ places. Then again, it tastes better so no real complaints from me. The charro beans and mac-n-cheese sides were both very good with authentic, rich flavor (especially the beans! Try them!). My husband ordered the brisket dinner with 2 sides for the same price. He also loved the charro beans, but his second side was the potato salad. Be prepared for authentic, house-made potato salad - the kind with tons of fixings in it, not overly mayo based, huge chopped eggs, THE works! It was the epitome of southern BBQ in my book.
