The Pit Room////I really liked this place, and was guided by the reviews on Yelp to come here. I'm glad I did! My shop just moved to this side of town so I'm really close to them now. I feel like if we didn't get a really lucky to get a really good parking spot at lunch, parking would have been very difficult. But parking aside, coming here was really worth it. So, here are the good points. The people here were very friendly. (The cashier in particular was very friendly, he made pleasant small talk about my gauges in my ears, but I do not recall his name. He was super cool, we really liked him!) It was a really nice relaxed atmosphere, which I really appreciate, especially after a long day of work. I also thought coming here would break the bank, because good BBQ typically does, but I found this place pleasantly affordable. I got the brisket and I LOVED the flavor, it was incredibly memorable. And the portion for what you paid was amazing. My boyfriend and I both agreed the macaroni was wonderful. It had a very interesting taste, almost like nacho cheese. We really liked that. I got the potato salad and I actually really loved it! Sometimes it's a toss up with potato salad because sometimes the potatoes are not cooked enough, but this potato salad was smooth and silky and was quite remarkable. But all that aside, my absolute FAVORITE thing I tried was at the condiments bar. They had these home-made habanero pickles the were completely outstanding. I went back and got some like three times. I mean, pickles are definitely one of my favorite foods so perhaps I'm a little biased in this regard, but I adored those pickles. I wish I had some right now! They had the absolute perfect amount of spice and still had little sprigs of dill and some pickled carrots and the flavor was phenomenal. There were some dowsides to this place, however. The BBQ sauce was really not my cup of tea. It tasted just like pasta sauce with liquid smoke in it. Like Ragu pasta sauce. It was really bizarre. I don't normally nitpick stuff like that because I'm sure lots of people like it! But it was really strange tasting, so much so that I actually gave up eating it just to preserve the awesome flavor of the rub on the brisket. In regards to the brisket, it was actually a little dry, which surprised me. It's flavor was so good though that I didn't really mind. My boyfriend had gotten the ribs and had me try a little and they were perfect, so I wish I had gotten them instead. Those were really the only negatives though! Everything else was great and I will absolutely go back, just skip out on the sauce and stick to the ribs and I will be A1!
