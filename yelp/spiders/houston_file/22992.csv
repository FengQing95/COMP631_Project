Uchi////We dined at Uchi for my 50th birthday dinner. We did the 6 course signature tasting--2 cold dishes, 2 hot, 1 savory, and a dessert.  In addition we added 4 pieces of sushi and Brussels sprouts (the sprouts were truly amazing!).  As it was my birthday, the restaurant treated us to an additional 4 pieces of sushi as well as an added dessert.
