Local Foods////A very trendy place to hangout for lunch or dinner. When looking at the menu, there are 8 sandwiches to choose from. I heard their menu changes since they have been open, so I'm thinking they are coordinating with the availability of the ingredients based on the season. Interesting side orders come with the sandwiches liked the Tuscan Kale or Orzo. I went on a Sunday evening and it was quiet but I would expect this place to be busy during the weekday lunch hours. What really impressed me were their fresh ingredients. To see everything made from scratch got me coming back.
