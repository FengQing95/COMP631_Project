Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Avoid this place it will be out of business in 2 years, maybe 3 if the owners push it. Once the "OMG it's new" crowd dies down this cafe will be dying to bake me, you and everyone we know a croissant. But it will be too late then, heck it's too late already.
