Uchi////I've heard rave reviews going on for hours and hours about this place, so I had to check it out since I live fairly close by.  A friend of mine was in town for the weekend so we dove in not knowing exactly what to expect.  We were both impressed.  Not sure if it's because there is a lack of real quality sushi and Japanese fare around here....but I think this place stands up on its own.
