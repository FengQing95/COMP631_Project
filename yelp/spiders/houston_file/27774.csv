The Pit Room////This is my second visit to The Pit Room but there still is one minor problem. The place is fly central. They're everywhere. I'm sure it's due to the fact that there is a lot of traffic coming into and out of the three entrances. Still, I'm sure that short of flypaper that there is something that can be done.
