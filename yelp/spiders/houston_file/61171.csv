Baby Barnaby's////Discriminatory establishment. We arrived at 9:20 with 4 adults and 2 children and signed our names on the wait list. We figured 30 minutes to an hour wait as the place was packed and very small. An hour goes by and all the parties prior to ours had been seated, and then they started to seat the parties arrived after us. We asked the gentleman in charge of calling out party names what was going on and he said they were waiting for two tables inside that had already paid to get up and leave and then they would be able to seat us. 15 minutes go by and we go check again and they have seated other patrons in those tables instead of us. It was very clear we were not wanted here so we left after an hour plus of waiting. Very disappointing to say the least.
