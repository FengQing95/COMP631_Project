The Pit Room////I really enjoyed the food here at the Pit Room, I thought they did a good job with the brisket, the pulled pork and the pork ribs. By the time we got here at 530pm on a Sunday they already ran out of beef ribs and beef sausage (and ice cream sandwiches), but that's the risk you run at any good bbq joint, so I'm not that disappointed.
