Uchi////Bonus Dessert! Fried Milk: the waiter told us this was Uchi's most popular dessert, but we initially decided to forego it in lieu of the lemon gelato. As a happy surprise, the waiter brought this out on-the-house because it was my boyfriend's birthday. It was phenomenal. I still prefer the lemon flavors of the gelato, but this was my boyfriend's favorite of the two desserts. Delicious.
