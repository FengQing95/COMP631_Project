Uchi////This place is amazing. Make it in time for happy hour since a lot of my favorites are on the HH menu. The service is the best in Houston. They explain everything you are eating and are very knowledgeable. This place is worth every penny and its gonna take quite a few to eat here. Go early so you are not waiting too long for a table.
