Baby Barnaby's////Awesome place! Love the food! Love the staff! Greens eggs is the best and the pancakes can be split between two people because they are so big. Sign up on the wait list outside, make sure you put whether you want inside or outside seating (outside is faster) but either way is worth the wait! Get there early!
