JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I just read your review and I'm very concerned about your health condition and the product you consumed.  I also own several other sushi restaurants and we have the same supplier for our seaweed salad in those restaurants as well.  So far, no one has reported in anything with the seaweed salad, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of one shipment being tainted.  If you caught Staph from the seaweed salad, I need to pull any and all product off the shelf as was as notifying our supplier of the contamination.  We don't make our seaweed salad in house.  It is sent to us in pre-portioned package that is frozen and already marinated.  We defrost in our cooler overnight and it's simply a "open and serve" product on our line.  Your health condition is of the most importance so I would like to put you in touch with our insurance carrier to make sure receive the best care as well as getting the necessary information from you to isolate and investigate this case.  I'm assuming the hospital you visited performed the necessary tests to determine it was a Staph.  Please make sure you forward the test results to our insurance carrier and they will do all they can to assist you.  I will be sending you a private message with my contact information.  Once again, I do apologize for your experience and this is the first time I've had a customer experience a food poisoning issue with our seaweed salad.  The product comes from JFC, a very reputable Japanese food supply company here in the US.  If there is anything I can do for you, please do not hesitate to contain me directly.  Hope you have a speedy recovery.
