Uchi////Fried Milk: 5 of 5. Again, terrible unappetizing name followed by a wonderfully decadent desert. Fried condensed milk balls with an oozing center, dark chocolate powder, a chocolate graham crisp, and God knows what else, it was a great way to end our meal. Did I mention I'm lactose intolerant? Was it worth it? YES.
