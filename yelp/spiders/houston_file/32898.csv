Local Foods////Hipster sandwiches!  Local Foods is a scratch gourmet sandwich shop featuring sandwiches, soups, salads, and desserts made from fresh local ingredients.  I love the laid back décor of the restaurant, a mixture of hipster and shabby chic.  You order your food at the counter and they give you a number and when your food is ready, a server will bring it to you.
