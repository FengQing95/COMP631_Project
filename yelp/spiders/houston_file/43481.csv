Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every time I pass by, or stop in, it is always crowded. There is always a line. There is almost never any parking, so be prepared to park down the street. My first time there I got a passion fruit macaron and orange juice. They were out of the things that I wanted to try... like the croissants.
