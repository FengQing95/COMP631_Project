Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This spot is never NOT packed with a line that often forms along the sidewalk. This is a chain found in TX, CO, and CA, and I happened to visit the location in Montrose in Houston. I found that the food was good, 'diner like', and fills a niche in the neighborhood. The service leaves much to be desired. I went on a Friday a bit before lunchtime and there was a 25-35 min wait, which I typically see as a good sign.
