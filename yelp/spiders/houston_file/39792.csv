Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I am absolutely appalled at a comment made by the manager and wait staff at this restaurant this evening. To start, I have been to this restaurant 2 times in the past with very average service, and the only reason I returned for this occasion was a happy hour hosted by my girlfriends company. As soon as we walked in we kindly asked to be sat outside and were told "no" in an unkind manner. We were also told we could not push together our tables and were told that we needed to leave within an hour and a half. First of all, in what world is this how you greet a party of people who have chosen your venue to host a post-work happy hour where the point is to enjoy yourself? Not only was the service bad as soon as we stepped in, but it didn't improve, and actually got worse. The food came out cold and had clearly been sitting for a while. To cap all of this off, we were confronted by a manager after we were trying to close out and leave who proceeded to berate us for the amount of tip we left to the waitress who served us. We left 15%. As a former server, I gauge 15% to be the absolute minimum you should leave regardless of how bad your service was. 15% = poor to below average service which was what we received from every employee we interacted with. And as a former employee in the service industry, I was shocked to hear a MANAGER come up to us and tell us we shorted his waiter rather than apologize for the absolutely pathetic experience this place provided. I will not be returning here, my girlfriends company will not return here, and everyone I know within Corporate Houston will be steering clear of this place. If I could leave a negative review I would because 1 star is extremely generous.
