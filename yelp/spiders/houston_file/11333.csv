JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Enaefe - Thanks for the great review. I'm thankful your friends were able to convince you to try us out, and I'm Â even more pleased that our ramen met your satisfaction. I do agree our wait times during peak hours can be taxing, but as the late, great Yogi Berra once said: "Nobody goes to that restaurant anymore -- it's too crowded."
