Uchi////This place is delicious!  We have eaten at the bar every time we come because we enjoy watching the Chef prepare the sushi.  It is delicious and by far the best sushi restaurant in Houston!  If you make it in for their Happy Hour deal it cuts the bill by a third.  The pork ribs were to die for, and the spicy tuna rolls were amazing.
