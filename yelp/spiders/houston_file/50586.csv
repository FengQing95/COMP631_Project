Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the breakfast pot pie, which sounded really delicious, but was only okay. I expect I would've been happier ordering the pancakes or any of the eggs benedict dishes. My friend ordered the pancakes, and they were delicious. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in town.
