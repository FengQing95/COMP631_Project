Local Foods////(Local foods rep Nahum gave me the run down on all the awesome things you can do with the cauliflower, which is sold by the jar for $6 (small) or $9 (large) but make sure to try the Pickled fennel and Pickled Market Vegetables that are great on just about anything! want specifics? ask for Nahum!)
