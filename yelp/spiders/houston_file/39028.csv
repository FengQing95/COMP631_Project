Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The vibe of this restaurant is really chill, and can be great for groups and or for a one on one date night. My friends and I got the pickled vegetables, 12 hr braised short rib, blue cheese avocado salad, sweet potato mac and cheese, fries, and their BC lemonade. I would say my favourites were the braised short rib, pickled vegetables, and definitely the BC lemonade. The lemonade was made of vodka and had 3 slices of jalape√±o peppers. I loves the spice so I asked for another bigger slice for an extra kick. The short rib was great but I wouldn't share it if you're hungry!
