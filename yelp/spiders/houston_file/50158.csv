Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here with my girl to finally check this place out. My friends warned me about the long wait time but we wanted to go anyways. Turns out it wasn't as bad as it seemed on a 9:00 Sunday morning! We only waited about 45 minutes and the weather was perfect outside. While you wait, they provide complimentary coffee and water, corn hole game, hoola hoops lol, and board games. Our wait time went by quick! Once your table is ready, you'll get a text message on your phone.
