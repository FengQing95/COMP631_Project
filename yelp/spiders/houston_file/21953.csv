Uchi////It has been a while since we've been to Uchi. Oh it has been too long.  There is great - that's Kuu. Then there is greater than great - that's Uchi.  Put another way, Kuu is a solid all-star but Uchi is the MVP of the league.  Despite my recent well-deserved raving about Kuu, our meal at Uchi made clear who is still the boss of Japanese fusion in Houston. There is just an extra spark of creativity, a slightly higher level of quality, and a greater shared sense of experiencing something special that you can only find in a buzzing packed house (on a Wednesday no less) that Uchi has over Kuu.  Already looking forward to our next visit.
