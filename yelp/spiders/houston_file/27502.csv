The Pit Room////I ordered the one meat dinner which came with a choice of meat and two sides, a side of bbq sauce and a Love Street beer. I went with the brisket, elote and charro beans. All meals came with a slice of white bread. The brisket was so juicy and you can see the layer of smoke ring. I loved everything about it. I didn't know what elote was going into this experience but I'm glad I found out (turns out it's Mexican street corn). The sauce this was made in is spicy and had a nice after taste. As for the beans, I would order them again - great flavor and was a nice pairing to the very heavy brisket.
