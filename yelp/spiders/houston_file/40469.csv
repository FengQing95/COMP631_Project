Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had my birthday brunch here! It was actually recommended by my sister who thought the vibe was very cute for my birthday and I agree. I was able to make a brunch reservation for 10 people with no problem. Just like majority of the restaurants, the party won't get seated unless majority of the party is present. The only thing I did not like was the check splitting system, so they only allow eight forms of payment to be used, I guess I understand but it was just annoying and kind of an inconvenience. There is also a one dollar charge per slice of cake that is cut by the waiter or waitress.
