JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kim - Thank you for your review. I apologize that your meal failed to meet your expectations. And I regret that your ramen was lukewarm when you received it. There must have been a failure at some point in the service line because our ramen does not sit for more than 30 seconds from the time it is fully prepared to its delivery to the table. Among the more than 650 Yelp reviews, you would be hard-pressed to find another complaint about the temperature of our ramen! REGARDLESS, please know that you can send back a bowl for any reason and we will happily remake it or offer you another dish. Our front and back of house work extremely hard to provide excellent food and service, and our ultimate goal is for every customer to leave happy and satisfied after every visit with us. I hope you give us another try, and if you do, please ask for me or any of my managers on duty. We will make sure this does not happen again and that your 40+-minute drive for our ramen is worth the effort.
