Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The first time I went I ordered Havana Daydreaming which is pork, ham, and gruyere cheese on an open faced bun topped with a sunny side up egg- YUM!! It was delicious!! And the second time I ordered the BEAT sandwich- bacon, egg, arugula, and tomato topped with avocado. The BEAT sandwich was ok, I wouldn't get it again- the bacon was too overcooked in my opinion and thin. The real winning dishes of this place is the Sweet Utopia section of their menu. I am not a fan of sweets but luckily the people I came with were and so was I able to sample the sweet potato pancakes, OMG french toast, and the drunk'n monkey french toast and they were all aaahhmazzing!!! I looooved the OMG french toast.
