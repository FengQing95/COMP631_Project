Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once you get to the drooling-over-menu-in-your-booth stage, remember this simple fact: you cannot go wrong. Can't choose between all the phenomenal eggs benedict options? They have a Choose 2 Option. Can't pick pancakes or french toast? Substitute the french toast in for one of your pancake flight selections. You can literally add anything to your meal. Â The bacon a la carte does not disappoint. The cinnamon roll pancakes are decadent (although beware the walnuts if you can't stand nuts in your desserts like me!). Don't be afraid to try out the pancake of the day, young grasshopper; you're ready. The barbacoa eggs benny will make you feel sunshine. Mimosas are solid, but is that surprising? And expect your total bill to be between $10-$15 - no complaints there!
