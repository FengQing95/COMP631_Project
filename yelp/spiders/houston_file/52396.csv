Kata Robata////Very nice place! Their tapas style menu is a really great idea! I had the foie gras and my girlfriend had the braised pork belly. The foie gras was good but the pork belly could've used a little something else. The rolls we had were great though! They took a little while on one of our rolls and apologized that it took so long. They ended up comping it off our bill which was nice. That's all I really ask for when a restaurant messes up. Acknowledge your mistake and take steps to correct it. I don't expect to get comped every time they make a mistake but it was cool that they did. We weren't upset or anything because we were just enjoying ourselves and didn't really notice anyways. Great place though! We will be back!
