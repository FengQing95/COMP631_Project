Uchi////When we got our check, he left and went to talk to the ladies next to us for 10 mins straight, knowing we had to wait 40 mins on our dessert and our credit card was in the black folder. My fiancé handed the check back to him WHILE he was still yapping his mouth to the ladies and I gave him a look, basically saying do your fucking job because we have to leave. (It was 11pm) he wasn't happy about his Conversation being interrupted but boy do I give a crap?! Lol. It's my fiancée birthday and this sucker almost ruined our whole experience.
