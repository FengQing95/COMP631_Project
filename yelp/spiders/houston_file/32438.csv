Local Foods////The roast beef sandwich made the Houston Press' top 100 dishes of 2012 so I was stoked to try it, but I must say, I didn't enjoy it as much as the crunchy chicken. I thought the thinly sliced roast beef was excellent and well executed and that the horseradish aoli was a nice touch, but the cauliflower really detracted from the sandwich in my opinion. I thought the cauliflower itself was good, but the pairing didn't make a lot of sense to my unrefined palate. Â
