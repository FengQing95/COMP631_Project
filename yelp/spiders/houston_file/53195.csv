Kata Robata////Decided to try out this place with a friend after we arrived to Yildizlar across the street and it was closed for the evening. I was pleasantly surprised by the food, and with a few tweaks to the atmosphere and service, this place could quickly become a fave. Between the two of us, we ordered some edamame (pretty standard - good), two varieties of the beef robata, which were both tender and delicious, and some rolls.
