Local Foods////Crunchy chicken oh my Goooooood. I know I should always get one of the sides that's relatively healthy, like the kale salad (because it IS actually delicious) but I can never seem to pass up the homemade potato chips. And then I get a brownie. And usually a draft beer. When you think of lunch food in Heaven, this is what you think of.
