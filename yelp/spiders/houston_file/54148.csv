Kata Robata////Kata Robata can be 3-5 stars depending on what you order and what server you get for the night. When I went for my birthday we had an amazing server. He was attentive (just enough), had great recommendations and the food was delicious. The next time we had a server that came by twice and was very angry throughout the whole process. She seemed upset that we weren't drinking alcohol (we were there for lent).
