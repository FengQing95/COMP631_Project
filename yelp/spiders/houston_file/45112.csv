Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Let me tell you: it's beautiful. Lots of glass letting in natural daylight, wooden beams, natural colors and a large display of charming butter dishes and platters. Their simple display of baked goods and desserts can make even the dessert-hater's mouth water. We couldn't decide what to get, so we decided to go splitsies on a chocolate croissant and some breakfast roll (I forgot). And, with as hipster places go, there was a wide variety of macaroons, with every color of the rainbow.
