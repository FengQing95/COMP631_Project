Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So when I heard I would probably have to wait over an hour to eat here, I thought "this place can't possibly be that good..." IT IS! Amazing breakfast. We have been a couple times now, and yes the wait is a pain, but the bar and free coffee help. The breakfast tacos with chorizo are incredible. Also the peanut buttercup pancake is to die for! Can't wait for the heights location to open!
