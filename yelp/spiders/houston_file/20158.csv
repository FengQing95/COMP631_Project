Uchi////Food: 25/5 All the food here is ridiculously good. You can't go wrong with anything. But when I return (and trust me I will; I don't care that I live in another state and have no reason to return in the near future. As General MacArthur said "I came through and I shall return."), I will probably get 5 HAM AND EGG ROLLS for myself. I put that all in caps since I want anyone skimming through this rambling wall of text to see exactly what to get. Ham and Egg roll. It was the single best thing I've ever put into my mouth. I could attempt to describe it, but that would just get me angry that I'm not currently eating it right now as I type. So amazingly good. Another dish worthy of specific mention: the fried milk dessert. If you want to be that dude that everyone hates that brags all the time about cool and interesting things they've done, then get this dish. It's cool and interesting, and when you brag about all the different textures and flavors melding together, people will definitely hate you.
