The Pit Room////The dining room is very small. I suspect that there will need to be many many to-go orders if and when business gets booming. I believe a sign on the wall says the occupancy is 94 persons, but I'd be surprised if there were enough seats for that many people. I'd guess maybe just 10-12 four person tables.
