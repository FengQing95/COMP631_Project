JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The quality of Jinya has gone down since I lasted visited a year ago.  My husband and I went here towards the end of May 2017 and ordered 2 bowls of ramen.  We were waiting for about 20 minutes for our order and the waitress was really nice saying she'd check on it.  However, I think our ramen bowls were sitting there for awhile.  When we got our meal, the soup seemed to have coagulated so that's how we knew.  The noodles were slightly soggy and lukewarm.  We didn't even finish our noodles/soup.  Needless to say, we will not be going back.
