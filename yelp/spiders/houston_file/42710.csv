Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It feels like it's trying really hard to be a trendy, aesthetically pleasing coffee shop. It comes close, but it's not quite there. The space is pretty tight, with seating basically directly next to the pastries display. Food is bomb though. The baguettes are great!
