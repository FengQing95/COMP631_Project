Uchi////We then get to the main course. I'm really sorry that I don't remember the names of what was ordered but I have pictures. We got two of the main non sushi courses and then one sushi plate to share. The non sushi courses heavily underwhelmed me. There was nothing fantastic about them. The chicken with the lettuce to make wraps with (check picture) was extremely underwhelming, I kept waiting to get a kick or get a taste of more seasoned meat but alas, it was not to be. The sushi platter was much better, tasted extremely fresh and the fish tasted like great quality sushi fish. Any other place with this type of food would have gotten a four star but come on, this place is quite expensive and I expect the food to taste the same. I'd definitely come back and order just the sushis. I would still definitely recommend as I didn't dislike it and obviously a shit ton of people disagree with me.
