Local Foods////One of my favorite places to eat for a casual lunch or dinner.  Fresh organic ingredients make such a huge difference. Shrimp and blue crab sandwich (5/5 rating) & Crunchy Chicken Sandwich (5/5 rating) are my favorite sandwiches.  Recently tried the Vegetarian Chili (4/5 rating) for the first time and came away very impressed.
