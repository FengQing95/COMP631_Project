Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ok, this is my 3rd time trying to come here. I'm not into the whole sweets thing that much so I have wanted to come here for one thing and one thing only....to try their soft shell crab sandwich. 1st attempt, I came at 1:30p and the place was PACKED with absolutely no parking to speak of, so I gave up. 2nd attempt, I tried a later day around 5p. I was excited that hardly anyone was there but was denied yet again at the food counter when I was told that they stop serving food at 3p.....NOOOOO! And for my 3rd attempt, today, I get here at 2:30p and try to order my beloved crab sandwich only to be told its not on their menu today bc they change their menu every week....can I catch a friggin break people!!! Determined to eat feed my starving tum tum, I opt for their chicken Torta for $11. Very tasty and very spicy! Smaller food menu though with only about 6 entrees and a couple of select sides to offer. Based on the numerous reviews, I feel most will come here for their sweets & nummies and a fancy caffeine fix. Def will come back to try some coffee since I do dig the ambience the place offers. I must say the baked goods do look tasty though. Maybe I'll give those a try in a moment of weakness.
