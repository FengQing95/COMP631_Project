Local Foods////I got the duck confit sandwich, and I really couldn't get into it. Maybe I should have ordered something else because it had a really mushy consistency that I would have really enjoyed if I had no teeth. The flavors weren't bad though with the cranberry preserves, but again, that creamy texture that I do not want! Especially in the same sentence as my meat!
