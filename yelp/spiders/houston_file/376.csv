JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I went as an early Birthday Celebration, and we had a great experience there. We sat at the bar, and the service was excellent. Everyone was very nice and helpful. One of the bartenders/servers even suggested a few items since it was our first time there. We had the Pork Gyoza and shared the Tonkotsu Spicy. Everything was awesome!
