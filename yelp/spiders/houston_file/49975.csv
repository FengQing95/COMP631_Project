Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Sooooo, we all decide to try Snooze for breakfast. We figure 8am might beat the crowds on a Sunday morning, wrong. Big time wrong, 1 hour wait for first available. We all decide to wait it out as it must be fantastic since there are always people waiting to get in when we drive by. While outside in the heat waiting I look around and notice people in their cars, smart, stay in the AC. As we all stand outside waiting I try to get my wife to pick up one of the many Hula hoops and give it a go, I got the "not a Hula hoop morning" look. So the text message comes to my phone that our table is ready, we head in and are seated in a booth.
