Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The only thing that is exactly how it appears happens to be the pastries on display. They look fabulous, I mean if it were an art contest they would win. My one time experiencing the earl grey pastry puff was epically mouth watering. Not too sweet, just the right amount of cream. Overall this place gets a four.
