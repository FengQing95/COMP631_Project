Local Foods//// I have cravings for their egg salad sandwich and potato avocado soup. The egg sandwich is on the most delicious pretzel roll that I could eat everyday. The poato avocado soup is the beautiful creamy soup that is light but filling at the same time. I love it. I have also had the falafal sandwich which was very tasty but was a little too oily for me. I have been looking at the smoked salmon sandwich for a while but they are either out or I am craving egg salad. But I will get it one day soon. They also have delicious looking desserts that I have to use all my willpower not to order since you get so much food already with all the sandwiches. I normally eat half the sandwich and the soup then take the other half home for the next day.
