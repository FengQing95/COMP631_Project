JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi R. Mark M. - Thanks for your review. We appreciate your kind words. As far as our noodles are concerned, you are correct, we do not create them in-house, but we do ship them in refrigerated trucks from our corporate-franchise supplier in California three times per week. Thanks again, and we appreciate your giving us a try.
