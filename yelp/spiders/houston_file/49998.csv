Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We waited for about an hour and a half on a Saturday morning, which seems excessive, but we weren't too hungry yet, so it was fine. They do have jenga, hula hoop and other outdoor games to pass the time, but it was just too damn hot outside. Food here was amazing!! I ordered the pancake flight and chose the blueberry danish, pineapple upside down and bacon pancakes. They were some of the best I've ever had, and they were small enough that I was able to finish the whole thing! The blueberry danish one was probably my favorite. I definitely want to come back to try the OMG! French Toast, which sounds amazing.
