Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Really enjoyed this place. It's still relatively new to Houston and they're setting a couple things up, but they have an awesome whiskey room displaying their selections. I recommend the 38 Special which is pretty much in between an old fashion and manhattan. They have an old fashion as well but it was alright. The food was good too. We ordered pig candy, frog legs, poutine, and red velvet churros. Definitely look forward to coming here again and try some whiskey flights once it gets set up.
