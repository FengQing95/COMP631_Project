Kata Robata////Very bad experience eating here, having diarrhea all night. I just dined in at this sushi place last night after I heard a lot of good review. I ordered Omakase sushi. The sushis were very yummy better than other places in the town; however, it cost me $70 for 10 pieces of sushi. The worst thing is that I had diarrhea whole night and could not sleep. Can you imagine having diarrhea the whole night and need to work whole day, next morning (Sunday). The only food I had on that day were these sushis and a sandwich from a meeting in which my friend did not have any diarrhea.
