Uchi////The one real knock I have on Uchi is the "complimentary valet". I found the whole operation to be shady, seemingly run by guys who just needed a job and are pretending to be fancy, and who have no real respect for patrons. I found an animal cracker on my seat when my car was brought back to me. No wrapper, just a cookie. When I asked the valet for change to break my 20, he conveniently only had 5s, and asked me if that was okay. It was an awkward moment, because I could feel it was scripted, not authentic, and I honestly wanted to say no. This experience had me leave with a bitter taste in my mouth. The valet experience needs to be cleaned up, or discarded altogether.
