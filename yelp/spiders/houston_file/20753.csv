Uchi////Overall I would give Uchi a 4 and half stars. The half star would be for the walu walu. There is a lot of creativity and thought to each dish. The experience is well worth the wait. Even though this is more on the expensive side, the ingredients are very fresh and the originality of the dishes make up for it.
