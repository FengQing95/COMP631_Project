Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I generally have a good experience at Common Bond, mostly from the pastries and ambiance. They have lots of coffee offerings but it's not the best in town. The macarons are overpriced. I enjoy the almond chocolate croissant and the lunch sandwiches they offer. It's a wonderful place to hang out with friends or do some work. Customer service is also excellent. Will be revisiting.
