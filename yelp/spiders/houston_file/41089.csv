Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Big portions of delicious food.  We ate a chicken sandwich and a shredded meat sandwich, and it was too much food.  We could have done with out the chips, but they were so good!  Would not get the beans side again - it was just average.  The croissant we took back to our 17 year old son who devoured it.  The chocolate chip cookie never made it home to him . . . We will definitely be back!  Parking is an issue.
