Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Now this is a place to go to for brunch. Everything was absolutely amazing. There was a long wait, even with Covid. I waited about 45 mins to get a table but so worth the wait! What attracted me to this place was seeing pictures of the fruity pebbles french toast and wow it's a must get item! They put condensed milk on it and it's definitely a game changer. All the food we ordered was great and the service as well. Our server was amazing, she was so nice and checked up on my table frequently even when the restaurant was so busy
