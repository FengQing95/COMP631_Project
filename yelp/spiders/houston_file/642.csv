JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I only gave this place 4 stars because I wasn't too fond of the seating arrangement they had. There were two seater booths and four seater booths with chairs along with two long tables down the middle for seating. My husband and I were seated at the end cap of the long table...right in the middle of two couples. It felt a bit awkward being able to hear (so clearly) the conversations of those around us. You could even smell the perfume/cologne they were wearing, that's how close and intimate it was. Not the most ideal seating for couples in my opinion but it is what it is. The ramen on the other hand was absolutely fantastic! The spicy chicken ramen with a side of wontons (waiter recommended) was so flavorful and delicious. Though, it doesn't come with your "typical" ramen toppings when you order it, they have a list of add ons to suit your taste. Will definitely revisit this place when I'm in the Houston area again.
