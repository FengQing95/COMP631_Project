Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I don't really understand the great reviews. The atmosphere is great for a bar - maybe happy hour. We ordered the beef short ribs and open faced turkey sandwich. The rib portion was smaller than most appetizers and taste was way too sweet for my liking. Turkey sandwich was ok but nothing to write home about. Go if your looking for a cool bar atmosphere but avoid this place if you're hungry! We are leaving to go find something good to eat!
