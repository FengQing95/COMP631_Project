JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was a bit disappointed when trying this restaurant for the first time. It's not because of the service. The food was not what I expected. This place isn't like your traditional ramen spot. They don't serve udon noodles, flavored edamame, and the spices are milder than what you would expected. This doesn't mean the food is terrible. Just not as flavorful as your traditional ramen spot. If you want satisfaction I wouldn't have this as first on my list for spots to try. Also, the SAKE was great and I enjoyed the appetizers.
