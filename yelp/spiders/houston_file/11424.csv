JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is their second location as the first location is in Webster, which is relatively far for anyone who lives in Houston proper. This one is in Midtown so it's a great location for foot traffic and people to come and enjoy some ramen. One other good thing is that there's a free parking garage. There's also a bar in the front where they serve craft beer, sake, and other specialty drinks. One thing most new comers don't know is that there's big community tables in the middle of the restaurant where you may be seated with other ramen patrons.
