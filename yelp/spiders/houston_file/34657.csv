Local Foods////Why: Solid brunch, lunch, and dinner spot. Bring family, friends, or even just yourself for fresh, tasty creative spins on sandwiches, salad, coffee, drinks, and sides. Every time I go, the quality is consistent. This review is totally redundant, but as long as it stays the same, this will be one of the best meal spots in Houston for a long time.
