Uchi////Amazing served, best sushi I've ever eaten, each dish was clearly explained before sved.$10 discount for the 1st time visitand thry also have a small dish of dessert as a present for my friend's birthday. What's more, the happy hours cut the price to half, and they were all in high quality. Only $6-7 a roll, it couldn't be any cheaper. Really really love the place
