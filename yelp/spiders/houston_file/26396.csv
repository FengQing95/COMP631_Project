The Pit Room////The Pit Room is at the top of my list of BBQ joints when visitng Houston. The brisket, sausage, pulled pork and pork ribs were all smoked to perfection.....even the turkey was prepared well (moist and full of flavor).  My favorite is the fall off the bone beef ribs. Simply put, the best I have ever had in this area. The sides including the Mac N Cheese and cole slaw were also winners.  Will make this a must visit on all my trips to Houston.
