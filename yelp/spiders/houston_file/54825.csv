Kata Robata////The dinning room was very nice, staff service was very friendly. However, the food is not up to par. I love their Soma restaurant more (Soma is sister-restaurant). I tried all of item on happy hour menu and was not impressed. All of the food options were pretty basic and there was no wow factor. I also tried the two ramen choices on the menu, and they were also under average, I had better ramen. I would recommend the ox tail ramen over the spicy one.
