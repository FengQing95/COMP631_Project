Uchi////I wish I had more time to write this review as I would love to describe everything we've had at this point.  But, since I'm in a hurry, I will say try the Hama Chili, Yokai Berry, and Shag.  Honestly, the only two things I've had there that I didn't like were the Machi Cure (which they say are like Japanese nachos - nobody at our table like them) and the Hamachi Nabe (purely due to my personal taste as I'm not big on cooked fish and the hot broth sort of cooks the tuna - everyone else liked it but it is filling).
