Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have been trying to come to Snooze since it first opened and was finally able to get up early enough last Saturday. We arrived around 8:30ish and found street parking. Note: This is the Heights and parking is not fun, but they do have a very tiny parking lot and some street parking near the restaurant. We were told the wait was 30-40 minutes. We ended up waiting closer to 50 which is why I took off a star. I know this place is always hopping, but I appreciate an accurate wait time. Anyway, they do offer free coffee while you are waiting which is awesome! There is also cornhole outside to play if there aren't too many kids around. I will say that you need to be careful if you are parking in the parking lot because there are so many people standing around. Â
