Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of my favorite breakfast places. I usually get the three egg omelette and it's pretty amazing! I love love love it here. As you wait for your food they do have various games you could play as you wait for your food! Their service is pretty good. Also don't forget to ask about their daily pancake special! 9times out of 10 you'll love it.
