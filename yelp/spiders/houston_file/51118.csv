Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////**update: upon return early Saturday morning experienced a 30 minute wait BUT NO worries- free coffee and fun games to play while you wait! Service was EXCELLENT and everyone is SO nice! Ordered pancake flight and combination Benedict :) pomegranate mimosa definitely didn't let me down!
