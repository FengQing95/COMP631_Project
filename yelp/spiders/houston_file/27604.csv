The Pit Room////Yummy! Went last night for dinner. A bit of a line but not too bad. Both my husband and I ordered 1 meat plate. I had brisket (lean) with Mac and cheese and coke slaw. The brisket MELTED in your mouth. Sometimes when you request lean it is dry. Not at the Pit Room it was perfect! Sides were excellent also. Hubby had pork ribs with coke slaw and potato salad. His was excellent also. Be back real soon!!
