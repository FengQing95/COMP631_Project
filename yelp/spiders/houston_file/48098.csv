Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait was about 15-30 minutes. It was fairly busy so it took a while to get our food. Our waitress gave us with the "pancake of the day" while we waited for food. That was a great gesture for customer service. I had a regular pancake, hashbrowns with cheddar cheese and ham. Very good!
