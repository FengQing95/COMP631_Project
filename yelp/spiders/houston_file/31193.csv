Local Foods////If organic, healthy, but expensive food is your thing, then you definitely go here. Me, I'd rather something more artificial and greasy but tastes good and reasonably priced. Parking is a mess during lunch or dinner hours, and even worse during weekend due to location - it's in the same complex as Benjy's and Thai Spice with YMCA, new apartment complex, and Rice Village just around the corner. I had the pastrami sandwich with quinoa and cabbage slaw - I barely touched the sides (tastes too healthy for me!) and nothing special with the sandwich, even compared to pastrami sandwich from franchise places. However, my friends thoroughly enjoyed the truffled egg salad and lemongrass soup - while the lox bagel is just so-so. It's probably just a case of ordering wrong item and have a high expectation after exhausting parkinig search, so I may give it another shot in the future whenever I can find time to make it there before its early closing time and hectic parking during the weekend.
