Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ugh this place is so good! Take all my money! But seriously, the pastries are consistently amazing. I've only had dinner a few times, but it's been really good. The first time I got coffee here a few years ago I didn't love it, but I got an iced coffee last time and it was really good. My coworkers and I come here when we want a decadent dessert ;) The cookies and entremet are always a good choice.
