Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The display is beautiful. I literally want to order one of every pastry when I walk in, but my eyes are notoriously bigger than my stomach. I've had the chocolate croissant, which was really good, but my new favorite thing that I will only ever go here for is the daily bread. Just order it. You won't regret it. It's so good, I don't even know how to describe it. The spreads and preserves it comes with are equally amazing.
