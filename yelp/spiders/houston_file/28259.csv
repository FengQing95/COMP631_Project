The Pit Room////The weekday lunch line was not too bad and it only took 5 minutes for them to put together four brisket sandwiches, a large side of cole slaw, potato salad, and smoked sausage. Although the restaurant is kind of small, we sat comfortably in a booth to enjoy the delicious meat. I was very satisfied with the quality of the beef brisket and the cut was amazingly balanced by both lean and moist parts. The bun held up good with each bite and the slightly tangy and peppery taste of the barbecue sauce was to die for. The sausage was also a winner as it did not taste super greasy or tough like some other place make them. The potato salad was quite refreshing and had a nice amount of mayo mixed in to create the right amount of creaminess. The cole slaw was not what I expected though, too rough and not enough dressing, making it quite bland.
