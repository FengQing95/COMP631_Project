Local Foods////For some reason, I keep finding myself choosing Local Foods over many other Rice Village options. It's got that special "something something", and is truly a gem of the Village. It's got a nice space, open kitchen design, and extremely friendly service. Also perfect for any occasion, whether you've come with a coworker, friend, or by yourself. Best of all, the food is both healthy and yummy at the same time!! That's rare to find these days.
