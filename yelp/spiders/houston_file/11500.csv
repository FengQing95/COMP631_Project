JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My husband and I had a great experience dining here on Sunday afternoon. There was a small wait and the inside is pretty crowed but that's to be expected with a place this popular in a small space so I don't fault them for it. Our waiter was excellent. Unfortunately I didn't catch his name because it was a little loud in the dining area but he had on Black rimmed glasses and a striped red shirt. This was only our second time trying ramen as I was underwhelmed by the first time at a different restaurant and our waiter was quick to help me make a decision on what to order. I appreciated the extra minutes he took to explain the menu to me.
