Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Their brunch menu options are one of a kind! We had the Fruity Pebbles French toast, King Pancakes and Potato Benedict (requested all of these items to be made without pork/meat). Let me just say the french toast was the best I've ever had!! I had ZERO intentions to break my diet or even take a bite but when I did, I didn't reget it and I ate most of it!! Made with condensed milk and fresh berries, this was freaking delicious. The king pancakes were also super yummy- the banana cream in between the pancakes and the maple peanut butter glaze on top made these one heck of a yummy pancake stack! They also have tons of other savory options for brunch so definitely will come back to give this another try!
