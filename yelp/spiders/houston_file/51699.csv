Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Let's do better, I'm sure staffing is down because the capacity amount is down 50% , I get it but at a certain point I feel service should be declined in the most professional way possible , when wait times are at an hour or 2 for food, that should be voiced honestly so consumers can make a conscious decision to wait that long.
