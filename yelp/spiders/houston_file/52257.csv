Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I am a big pancake fan and Snooze caters to this. Ask about the pancake of the week. It's not on the menu but different every week and created by a chef at one of the Snooze locations around the country. Are you vegan, vegetarian, GF, etc? Well Snooze has lots to choose from on the menu. The only thing that bugs me is no Splenda or Sweet N Low. They only have stevia which unfortunately for me causes the coffee to have a metallic taste. So I just bring my own Splenda. Haha.
