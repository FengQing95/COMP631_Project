Baby Barnaby's////Don't bring your friends on a diet.  Do bring your friends who will go all in on ordering everything off the menu.  First..bring an umbrella. The outside waiting area is small and you may need to stand in the sun. We went on a Sunday and waited 1 hr for the table. But we also had a pet so that meant we had to wait for the few outdoor options. Despite the wait...omg...SO WORTH IT!!!
