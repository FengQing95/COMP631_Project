Uchi////After some back and forth, we were finally given a table but was given a rude dismissal by the (previously friendly) waitress at the wine bar, possibly because we couldn't close our ticket nor tip her in cash (because we didn't have any). Final note to close it all up, we noticed a couple of tables beside us that were empty the entire time until a couple was seated next to us at 6:30PM SHARP, which is when the social hour ended. We overheard the sad, distraught couple next to us pleading to order from the social hour menu as they have waited 1 hour in the patio. Well, call me a conspiracy theorist, but we think that incident was either an intentional lure/bait scheme, or just plain inefficiency in the seating management system/service.
