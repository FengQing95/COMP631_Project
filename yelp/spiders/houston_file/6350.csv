JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Some of the best noodles I've had in a very very long time. The flavor hit me like a explosion and it was just a great time to be alive. The food is the best the staff is very courteous. This place deserves 5 stars because they rock what they do the best. I got kind of a hipster vibe. Probably because of the area.
