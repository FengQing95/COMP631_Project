JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Was it just my recent experience eating here or has jinya past it's peak? Unfortunately my last bowl of ramen here was just okay and left me feeling unsatisfied after years of consistent 10/10 bowls. Hope there isn't any changes happening that is affecting the quality of food.
