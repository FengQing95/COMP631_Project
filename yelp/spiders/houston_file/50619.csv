Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Ok, it looks expensive but order online and you WON'T regret it!! This has to be the best breakfast I've ever tasted. I don't eat pork products but I've had lox and chicken proteins - the deal maker? OMG Stuffed French Toast & Blueberry Danish (stuffed) Pancakes!! Their Omeletes and Avacado Toast items are out of this world!
