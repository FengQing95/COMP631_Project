Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Service is hit or miss; sometimes it's super polite/helpful, other times the people taking my order make me feel like I'm holding up the line as I'm asking questions about the menu. It's a nice little sunny study spot on weekdays since it doesn't get too crowded at lunch, but avoid it like the plague on weekends when the line is often out the door.
