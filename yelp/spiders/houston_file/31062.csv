The Pit Room////The brisket and the queso were some of the best I've had at any restaurant ever. The brisket was perfectly smokey and tender, with a really good spicy peppercorn rub on the outside. The queso was the perfect spice level and consistency. The BBQ would have been better if it were sweeter and with more flavor. The venison sausage was a but dry and too spicy but lacking flavor, but the beef sausage was pretty solid with a nice flavor to it. I would definitely be back for the BBQ alone!
