Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We got there around 8:30 and to our surprise there was hardly no wait (maybe about 20 minutes or so). No probs bc we enjoyed being outside in the rare beautiful 70 degree weather while watching kids play with the cool bean toss they had set up out in the parking lot while sipping on our complimentary coffee.
