Uchi////After all the rave and a month to get in...we were disappointed with the chef's special 10 course that lacked the fusion that is all the rage.  For the money it was not worth it, I expected my taste buds to rejoice and honestly it was just ok...the salad, duck and dessert was good but everything else was just ok.  Sorry ravers...I have had better.  IF I went back I would definitely venture on my own and not trust that the chef would present me with a satisfying fusion experience.
