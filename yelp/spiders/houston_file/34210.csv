Local Foods////4 star is coz of our experience today. My husband got a small piece of wooden skewer in his falafel sandwich. When he highlighted it they were prompt to bring out a new one. Hope this is just a one time thing (please please). But over all love their food, love their sides, love the outside seating area and the mint and orangey drink too.
