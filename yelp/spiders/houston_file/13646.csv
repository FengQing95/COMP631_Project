JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I really wanted to try this place because of the great reviews.  We took every detail into account to get familiar with previous comments and review to explore this establishment. However, as of today, we simply had to walk out without trying any dishes because of the negligence of COVID protocol not being practice.  Every table and almost every seat was being filled rapidly by incoming customers. We just simply could not support an establishment who is not taking precautions to protect their clients.
