The Pit Room////I was in town for a UFC event and my buddy told me we had to go here for lunch. He also said I had to try the tacos, so I ordered the Tex Mex dinner. It had two tacos and two sides, I ordered one brisket, one pulled pork taco, mac and cheese, and potato salad. That pulled pork taco was the best I have ever had. It was moist, delicious, and flavorful. It didn't need any sauce at all it was that good. The mac and cheese and potato salad were absolutely delicious and i even was able to taste some of their homemade chips. Those things were out of this world good, salty and fantastic. If you are in Houston, stop by here for some real good BBQ.
