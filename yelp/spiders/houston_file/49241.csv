Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I want to try the rest of the menu, but my simple mind can't bear to get anything else! My first visit, I did get a taste of the birthday pancakes. And for someone who is not a big fan of pancakes and sweet things in general, it was AMAZING! And huge! It fed our party of 8!
