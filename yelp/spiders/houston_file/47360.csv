Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is a yes, every day all day!!! The wait and the parking were both crazy on a Saturday morning but the food made up for it! I had the OMG French toast and it seriously was amazing! Don't think about it, just go! Writing this review is making me want to stop by again before work.
