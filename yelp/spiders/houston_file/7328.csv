JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Nikki - Thank you for your feedback and the kind words. I agree that a loud dining atmosphere probably isn't conducive for a first date -- I, for one, enjoy dinner over soft music. Nevertheless, JINYA's concept is geared towards "trendy," which is a main guideline we must follow as a franchisee. So in that regard, we'll never be all things to all people. But besides that, we are very pleased you enjoyed the food. Hope to see you again soon!
