Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This spot is just vibing! I love Bosscat! Â Came here for dinner and the ambience is awesome. They play great music. Lots of people around just eating/ drinking and having a good time. Personal favs are the poutine and burger! A must try. Both are delicious. Flavors and presentation was solid. Kudos to the chef. Their staff is also super nice and friendly. Excited to go back here again - til next time!
