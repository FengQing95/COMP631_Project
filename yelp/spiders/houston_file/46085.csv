Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Awesome service! Lady at the bakery part of was super helpful. We got the tiramisu macarons, lavender latte, chai latte and chocolate walnut cookie. My friend thought the chocolate walnut cookie was okay but liked the chai latte. The lavender latte was pretty good, not too sweet. The tiramisu macrons were a bit small for the price but good as well.
