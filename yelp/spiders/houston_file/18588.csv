Uchi////We have been friends Uchi's for a very long time. We used to fly from Houston to Austin just to go and have their cuisine. The brussels sprouts are a must have. After that just let your waiter know what you don't like and let the chef design your meal. It's a great experience. Make sure you have reservations. If you love great food, you must try this place out.
