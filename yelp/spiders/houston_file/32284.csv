Local Foods////The Gulf Shrimp and crab sandwich was a little too "mayonnaisey" for me but there was definitely a generous amount of crab and shrimp filling. I was too full to try my best friend's sister's dish, but overall, the experience has been a memorable one. Both a feast for my eyes and a party for my tastebuds! Thanks for making local foods, so tasty! I will be back!
