Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////It's rare for us to come downtown since we live far. Will definitely make the trip more often just for this place! Looking for a quick dessert stop 10 before 8 we asked if we could still go in, since many businesses don't accept costumers close to closing time. They were so welcoming and recommended their favorite treats. The tiramisu, chocolate chip cookies and macrons were the best ! Definitely will come again !
