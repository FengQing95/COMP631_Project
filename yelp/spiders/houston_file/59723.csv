Baby Barnaby's////One of the best breakfast I've ate in Houston. The wait can be long, but I think it's well worth it. The restaurant is small and I'm not sure if I would come here in hot weather as you won't really cool down if you sit inside either. Also the coffee isn't strong as I had three cups that morning and was still tried.
