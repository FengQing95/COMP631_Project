Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've only had pastries and their avocado toast here and they were all pretty good though pricey. For example, I love their pistachio croissant but it's $4.50 (seriously?! as much as I love it, I've had better croissants elsewhere for much much cheaper). It's also super crowded inside and service is pretty much nonexistent. After my first trip here, I thought I would come here so much more often but now I don't come here unless I'm really craving their pastries.
