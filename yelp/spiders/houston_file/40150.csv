Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I love Bosscat! We were at this location a few days ago to celebrate a few birthdays. The service is wonderful. As soon as you walk in you have two beautiful ladies greeting and seating you. The place is gorgeous just like the location in OC. I used to visit there when I lived in LA and that's what made me want to visit the Houston location. So glad I did. Love the menu! We did the portabella fries to start with cilantro aioli sauce - a must for appetizers. I ordered the Good Life drink which was really delicious and finally wrapped up with a chicken burger and fries! My friends ordered the Bosscat burger and were very happy also. Big thanks to Geoffrey for all the suggestions and for being awesome! I'm considering having my bday brunch there in April
