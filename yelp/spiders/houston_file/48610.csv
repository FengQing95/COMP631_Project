Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I had been hearing rave reviews about this place, and they didn't disappoint!! My wife had the upside down pineapple pancake and the corn beef hash....she LOVED it!! I had the peanut butter pancakes, molten chocolate pancakes, and french toast...it was the BOMB!!! Our server Safuwra was on point and super sweet!! Definitely Â a new spot to dine at when in the Montrose area!!!
