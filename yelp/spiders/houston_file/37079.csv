Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Had lunch here 3/3 and the fries were disappointing in the lack of seasoning. Bland hush puppies with hardly any pork in them. I have had brunch here before and it was amazing so I know the potential of the Resturant. I do hope the restaurant considers updating the pork hush puppies to add more pork and flavor to the breading.
