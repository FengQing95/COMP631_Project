JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant is a little small so for parties larger than 6 requires quite a bit of wait time. They have ramen bar style seating in the center of the restaurant and small booths surrounding the center large table. There are also 2 bars, one is at the front of the restaurant with a tv and the back is right in front of the kitchen.
