Kata Robata////I am not sure why some yelpers compared this place to Uchi. I would like to apologize to Uchi for leaving my $150 at Kata Robata. The service was a solid 3 for their menu prices. One dish was ok (Portuguese octopus), most dishes are "meh", and their lobster tempura was simply horrible. The wine list by glass was pretty grim. We also found a hair on our tuna sashimi. Sashimi was properly exchanged but never-ever-ever a sushi hair would happen at Uchi. Anyway, it is an ok place to try once. Not a good place to become a regular customer though.
