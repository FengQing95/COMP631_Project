Baby Barnaby's////My two all-time favorites: Bob's healthy plate and green eggs! Also love their chicken apple sausages and pumpkin pancakes (seasonal). The inside and dog-friendlyness reminds me of Austin :) Only downside is that they close too early during the weekdays, because sometimes I want breakfast at 2pm! Heck, I wouldn't mind if they served breakfast all day!
