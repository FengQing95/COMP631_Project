Kata Robata////We went to Kata Robata for a birthday dinner just the guys.  The birthday boy ask the waiter to get us a round of drinks while we discussed what food to get.  When he came back with our drinks the birthday boy just asked the waiter to start bringing food for the table and left it up to his choice as far as what it was.  The next thing I know there are little plates set down on the table with enough food for a bite or two for each of us.  When we were finished the plates were removed and another round of something different was placed in front of us.  While we were eating the food the waiter eloquently described what we were eating and how it was prepared making it all sound even more delicious.  At first I thought to myself, how am I supposed to get full on one bite at a time.  To be honest though, I lost track of how many rounds came to the table.  We must have tried everything in the entire restaurant and I eventually had to cut myself off because I was so full.  I've never had a dining experience like that and it was pretty awesome.  I couldn't tell you if that's how it normally is when you go there or if that is just how the birthday boy wanted to do it but it was fantastic.  Imagine being able to sample everything until you have tried every item in the place or are full...whichever comes first.  So cool!
