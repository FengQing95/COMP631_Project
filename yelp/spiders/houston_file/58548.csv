Baby Barnaby's////Perfect for brunch (usually there is quite a long line out the door) on the weekend. Grab a cup of coffee while you wait outside. Everything is super-organic, free range, etc. Excellent green eggs (spinach omelet scramble) with chicken apple sausage. Fresh OJ and grapefruit juice squeezed on the premises.
