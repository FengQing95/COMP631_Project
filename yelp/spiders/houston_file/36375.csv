Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came here for brunch with two girlfriends a couple of Sundays ago. We sat at the bar and had the best time. There was a DJ which was pretty cool and gave the space a nice vibe. It was our first time there and our bartender, Maegen, was super helpful and friendly. We each tried something different. We had the Elvis pancakes, the chiliquiles, and the fruity pebble French toast and of course mimosas. We were all so impressed (and hungry) that we didn't even get to take pictures of everything. Everything tasted even better than it looked. The fruity pebble French toast definitely lived up to the hype. The other bartenders and severed were all really friendly and seemed to be enjoying their day just as much as we were, which really just added to the experience. Over all it was great. The food, the atmosphere, the staff and the drinks were all amazing. Can't wait to go back!
