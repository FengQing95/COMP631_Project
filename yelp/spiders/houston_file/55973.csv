Kata Robata////Kata is the restaurant version of Lost In Translation: you will enter a sleek, up-scale hotel; you will not need to know any Japanese or even see a Japanese person. You will meet other well-to-do people just like yourself, and everything will have been crafted to make sure that nothing will disturb you. The food will be curated to be high quality, and will perfectly fit your American tastes.
