Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat donut burger. I hated it! I was under impression that the burger would come with a regular iced donut. However they don't tell you it's literally whatever donut they have in stock ( I think thats VERY important) imagine ordering this and seeing a chocolate donut with yellow sprinkles. The people I came with had really good meals so I do believe that the food is good..it's just this particular item that I was not happy with.
