Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Very nice restaurant! Our friends suggested us to go have breakfast. So, we took their advice. We got up early in the morning since there will be a long line in the restaurant. We got there around 7:30 and it was almost full! We had a pan cake of the day to share. My husband had three eggs omelette and I had quinoa breakfast! Yummy! Recommended!
