Uchi////The experience here was worth the price and wait. I liked More than just the chill atmosphere- I absolutely loved how the waitress (shout out to Lori) for helping make a great experience here. She not only knew the detail/taste/ and gave her personal insight on the dishes- but she also gave us a quick snippet of the history of this restaurant. She had patience with our table of 5 + a baby and our indecisiveness.
