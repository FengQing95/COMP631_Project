Uchi////Think we paid about $30 a person for all those dishes! One bad thing- there was so much going on I couldn't have decided (or remembered) what my favorite dish was. There were clear favorites for the group, but I just don't remember those dishes specifically. Oh well. Maybe it's time to go try it out again.
