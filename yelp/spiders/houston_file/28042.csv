The Pit Room////Dudes seriously!? I was so excited to arrive and was excited by the long line and the smells but the reality of the food disappointed. I wasn't affected by the fact you ran out of chicken and so i got the pork ribs, the turkey, the beans and the potato salad - all Meh. However the pilsner i got was awesome. Ive had good BBQ, Ive had bad BBQ - this is my first BBQ in texas - i went home sad
