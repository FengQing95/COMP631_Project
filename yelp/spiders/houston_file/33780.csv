Local Foods////I will say that, while the food is quite good, it's a bit pricey for a sandwich/salad restaurant. There are definitely comparable places around Houston to get the same sort of meal for a far cheaper price. Still, if you don't mind spending an extra 2 or 3 dollars, Local Foods is definitely a good place to fill up when you need some grub.
