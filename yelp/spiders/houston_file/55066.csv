Kata Robata////I went for lunch one day, and I gotta say, they have some great lunch specials. I tried the Kata Special Chirashi and my friend got the Beef skewer bento box (I think). Both were really good! The Chirashi was actually really filling and had a great assortment of fish. My friend's beef was super tender and delicious.
