Uchi////I will eat here EVERY time I am in Houston! It is worth the wait and the bill in my opinion and I take my sushi seriously. Do not go expecting a California roll.....go and let them guide you through the menu! They always say there is some huge wait but I have gotten in with a party of 2 in less than 30 minutes every time.
