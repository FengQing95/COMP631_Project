Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Anyway, I love their Kouign Amann, though I'm sure it's a heart attack waiting to happen (think lots of butter and sugar) and I always get their croissants- either almond or chocolate. Their cookies are really good too, but I'm not a huge fan of their macaroons. I've also had their French toast for breakfast before, but I wouldn't get it again.
