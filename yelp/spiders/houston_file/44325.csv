Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As for the other pastries, they're good, but they don't hold a special place in my heart like the croissants or kouign amann. The fruit croissant is very sweet and doesn't really have the texture you would expect from a croissant. The scones are huge and come with butter and jam, but taste pretty average. The macarons are good but not mind-blowing.
