Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've only tried this place once and I'm def coming back! I went on a weekday around 11 and it was only a 5 min wait. I shared 3 items: Juan's Breakfast Tacos, Benny Duo (Ham Benedict lll & Benny Goodman), & the Breakfast Pot Pie. I recommend getting the first 2 items but not the pot pie. I was really disappointed because I read the reviews and the pot pie was popular but it was just a filled with air!! I don't remember my servers name but he was awesome, excellent service!!
