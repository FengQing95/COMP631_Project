Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////As for the food, we ordered the Breakfast Pot Pie, Pick Two Eggs Benedict (Chili Verde and Bella Bella) with a side of the OMG French Toast. The pot pie was actually better than I thought, good flavor and size (not too salty) and has a nice flakey pastry shell. The Benedicts were on point as well, with great flavors melding together for the Bella Bella (prosciutto and balsamic drizzle) and the chili verde (we got barbacoa). We heard that the French Toast to get were the OMG French Toast. While it was good, it was not the best I had and a little underwhelming.
