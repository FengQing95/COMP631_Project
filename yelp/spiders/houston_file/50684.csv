Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Laid back vibe. Server and service was stupendous . And the food was freaking great. I'll be back again. Also was giving a free pancake for being a 1st timer after letting my server know. Great place to eat, Â only issue is the wait time but it's worth the wait. Please try it out
