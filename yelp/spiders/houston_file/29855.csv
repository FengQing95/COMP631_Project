The Pit Room////This place was every bit of amazing & more! I came here twice in 1 month and each time I tried something new! The BEST thing here are the green beans and deer sausage. Who would think green beans can taste so good! I can eat this combination of these two daily! They're seasoned and bursting with flavor. The brisket and ribs are phenomenal as well, but prices are a bit steep. The Pit room is very very small so try to come at a early time when they first open. This place didn't disappoint me!
