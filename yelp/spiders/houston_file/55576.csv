Kata Robata////Green tea souffle cheesecake - I'm glad we ordered this to finish our meal. It helped balance out all the fattiness that we tasted the whole dinner. I like that it wasn't too rich. Coupled that with the fluffiness of the cake, and the strong green tea aroma, it was a perfect end for our meal.
