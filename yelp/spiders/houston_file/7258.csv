JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA has the Houston area in awe of their traditional bone broth and their variety of ramen offered. The quality is exceptional and the portions are bordering on superfluous. My spicy miso ramen was a crazy good but not quite as spicy as I usually prefer and so I added chile oil to get it up to par. That stuff is sinus clearing so adders beware. The dumplings were... alright. Really fell flat and filled us up unnecessarily before the main event hit the table.
