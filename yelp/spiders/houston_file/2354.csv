JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night at around 6:30 pm and was semi-surprised to find that there wasn't a wait. I will say that the interior is very nice and hip, as everything looks very modern and clean. In addition to the Brussel Sprouts Tempura that we ordered as an appetizer, I decided to order the Tonkatsu Spicy Ramen.
