JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you Yelp! Once again a beautiful find for a great ramen restaurant.  Great ambiance, mood lighting and decor, a ramen bar and community table for sharing. Food, flavors, menu choices and service - 5 stars for sure. Drink and cocktails- yes please, lychee martini a delights, wife got some foo foo tropical thing, was tasty. Lobster ramen (Lobster Me Happy) is what it was called, a deep rich pork broth mixed with lobster sauce, shrimp & lobster wonton, crispy brussels sprouts, soft poached soy or marinaded egg - da bomb!  Wife had the spicy miso ramen, broth is complex savory and hot, delish. Pork is tender melt in your mouth and seasoned well.  Service is great.  We will be back!
