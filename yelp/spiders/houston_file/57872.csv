Kata Robata////Kata robata is THE place to go for fresh, quality fish in Houston. We got chirashi, which had toro, salmon, Madai, unagi, hamachi, and an assortment of other fish. The toro was excellent quality, melt in your mouth buttery flavor. The Longhorn roll and toro rolls were also really tasty. Other dishes we ordered included butterfish and the grilled octopus. Butterfish was pretty average for a good Japanese restaurant, but octopus was so soft and tender and the sauce it came with complemented the food well! I've also tried the yuzu salmon dish and fish&fish hamachi collar, both which are excellent. Overall, can't go wrong with takeout or dine in here!
