Uchi////Wow. I think this is hands down the best restaurant in Houston. I dreamt about this place for days after my meal here. The food is creative, fresh, delicious. The service is friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. The happy hour menu made it affordable for us. I was worried about bringing kids here, but the staff was very welcoming to my kids. My daughter loved the place so much she asked me if we could live there. I wish, my dear, I wish!
