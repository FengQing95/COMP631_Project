Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This restaurant is so tasty! They have unique items and a large menu with good variety. The main negative is a long wait, sometimes up to an hour, but they have a good system in place. They will text you when your table is almost ready. At the Montrose location, we like to walk over to Southside espresso and have coffee while we wait.
