Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Okay Common Bond, I see you. BEST coffee in Houston, and we have tried a lot of places. We went early on Saturday morning and I am glad we did, it fills up fast but is assemble line style so it goes quickly. The seats are limited but this charming place is worth the wait. The pastries are EVERYTHING. Think Grand Budapest Hotel status.
