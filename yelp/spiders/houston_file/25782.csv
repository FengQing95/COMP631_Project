The Pit Room////My husband and I are huge barbecue fans, and The Pit Room's lean brisket is the best we've ever had. We always ask for only lean cuts as that is what we prefer, and their's is fantastic: very moist and flavorful with a delicious bark and thin edge of fat. We also loved the barbecue sauce, mac and cheese, marinated tomatoes and cucumbers, beef sausage and even the white bread. The only things we thought could use some improvement were the okra side and lemonade. We went on a Saturday night during prime time. It was busy, but there was just a short wait in line and the environment was very family friendly, though my three and five year old may have loved the spinning stools a bit too much. Great job. We live on the other side of town, but The Pit Room will be a destination restaurant for us, and we can't wait to come back for more!
