Local Foods////This is a great lunch spot! They have lots of really delicious and fresh items on the menu. I came here with my sister, Dad and step mom. We ordered the steak sandwich, avocado toast and the crispy chicken sandwich. All of our food was so delicious, and the sides were great as well! I loved the handmade kettle chips! And we tried a pecan chocolate chip cookie and the vegan brownie and both were really good!
