Kata Robata////The ONLY downside to the entire experience was the noise level.  It is a very loud restaurant with no real sound dampeners.  It can be hard to hear someone from across the table when the place is full.  As high a level as everything else is at this place, the noise is the only reason I'm not rating it at 5 stars.
