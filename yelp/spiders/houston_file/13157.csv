JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////It was late, rainy, sorta cold, and we were starving. This hit the spot. The choices all looked great and I think everyone finished or nearly finished their soup. I was especially pleased to see all three: chicken, pork, and vegetarian soups. The gyoza and shrimp appetizers were quite good as well!
