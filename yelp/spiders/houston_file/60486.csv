Baby Barnaby's////We called over a server and he snatched it out of his hand as I was literally trying to take a picture of it. We looked at the server confused as hell as to why he would be so aggressive then asked is that a bug. This server looked at it for 5 seconds and said with the a cheerful-fake voice, "YUP, would you like another order?" When we said no, he quickly said, "Okay I'll get it out of your way". Then rushed into another server and now two were staring at us.
