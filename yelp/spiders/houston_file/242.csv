JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I had the miso ramen and it was delicious. As others have said, it does not come with an egg, which costs an additional $1. The brussels sprouts appetizer was small, but tasty. Overall pretty good spot. We came in very late when there were not many people before closing and were treated well.
