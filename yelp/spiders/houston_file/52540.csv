Kata Robata////I went here twice for dinner in the last 2 months and the food was excellent both times. Happy hour menu was a great value with good variety. I didn't have any sushi, but the rolls were good and the lobster mac & cheese was probably one of my favorite dishes I've ever eaten in my life.
