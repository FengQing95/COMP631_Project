The Pit Room////There's an old saying that goes, "If you buy the best, you only cry once." The meaning of that expression is that if you spend at the front end, that's the only time you'll wince. The Pit Room's one-meat platter - one meat, two sides, and bread - runs $12.75. With a drink and tax, you're looking at $16.51. But...you get a LOT of food for that money and you WILL be full. If you're not wanting to spend quite that much, you can still experience their excellent brisket by ordering it a la carte (in increments of a quarter pound for $5 per unit), with individual sides running about $3.50. But unless you only want a quarter pound of meat, you're not going to be able to beat that $12.75 deal - I've tried!
