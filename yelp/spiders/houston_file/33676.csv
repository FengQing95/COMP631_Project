Local Foods////Very good! I loved the food, which their were more options but overall very good! The alcoholic drinks were super cute but also very weak, wouldn't recommend unless during happy hour which makes them only $5. I enjoy that their is a separate bar counter so you can order the drinks before the end of happy hour. Overall good and great atmosphere
