The Pit Room////Their sauce is great but the meats were so good that I felt like I was committing a crime putting anything on them at all. The venison sausage was a bit more dry--which I absolutely loved--and the garlic and pepper gave it the perfect amount of bite. The brisket was amazing too--well cooked and seasoned; it melted in my mouth.
