Local Foods////As for sides, I love the orzo pasta and tuscan kale. There's nothing that special about the orzo, but I just love the brightness it adds to my meal and feels light after eating such a heavy sandwich. Don't be afraid of the kale salad. You will not be chewing forever to choke down little green bits you have to eat because you need fiber. Either they take the tenderest stems, or they massage the crap out of them, but the leaves are always so tender and the raisins/pine nuts/parmesan make you forget you're eating kale. I also tried some of my husband's vegan chili. It was good! We were skeptical (as we are of all vegan things) but despite the beans and tomatoes, it was satisfying and warms your belly like a good chili. I've also tried the chips. Hand cut potatoes in a ton of old bay seasoning. I could eat that all day (and may have eaten them for breakfast...once.)
