Kata Robata////Great ambience , wonderful waitperson Susan. Selection of fish,rolls and sushi quite innovative. Grilled Ika,Caribbean roll and 5seaweed salad was my first venture to Kata Robata. Prices are a bit higher as in comparable places but the experience is worth it.  I do think that the sake is way overpriced. I can't wait to return to further explore the menu.  I'll have a beer next time!!
