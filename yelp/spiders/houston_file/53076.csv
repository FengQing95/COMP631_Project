Kata Robata////We arrived on Saturday night around 6:45 with no reservations. We were told our table would be ready in 20-30 minutes. No problem at all for us.  We headed over to the bar and enjoyed an old fashioned which was perfectly crafted by the extremely nice bartender.  After finishing our drinks, we turned down a second round because it had been about 25 minutes since we checked in. Tick Tock Tick Tock.... The hunger starts creeping in. 45 minutes pass and the hostess approaches..... She starts with sorry but we only have 2 seats at the sushi bar right now.... We decline sitting at the bar as she explains it will only be a a few more moments until we can have a table. Tick Tock Tick Tock more parties stroll in and are quickly seated as they have made reservations. Starvation begins, we are getting tired from standing in the small bar area where servers are constantly jockeying with us to get to the bar.  Tick Tock Tick Tock, hostess approaches again, now over 1 hour into our wait and explains that there are now 2 more seats at the bar! Come on lady, we want a table.  Tick Tock Tick Tock, finally we are seated after 1.5 hours of waiting (3 x the quoted wait) and all we get is a sorry for your wait.
