Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They are not only an amazing bakery, but super kind and helpful. I was having a stressful day at MD Anderson, and messed up on the location my daughter's birthday cake was at, they printed me a map and directed me there. My daughter said numerous times it was the most beautiful and delicios cake she ever had. On another occassion, my father needed a place to sit, have lunch and wait for me to finish at the hospital because only patients are allowed in. He said he had the best Texas club sandwhich and the people were so nice to let him take a long lunch while waiting for me.
