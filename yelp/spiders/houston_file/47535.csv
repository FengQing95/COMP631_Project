Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Was impressed with the Denver Snooze Eateries.  They come with a wait, as well, but when you're seated or served, they make you glad you stuck out the wait time.... truly.   I visited the T&C location and was put off at the subtle bitchiness of our waitress.  We had a couple of questions and she literally acted like she was pissed that she had to answer. The ONLY time she was remotely pleasant was when it was time to bring the check.
