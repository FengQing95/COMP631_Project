Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place was amazing for a birthday celebration for a birthday brunch! The place had great natural lighting for most of the tables, plus a bar right in the middle of the entire restaurant. The Sunday brunch menu was hard to choose from because all of their selections sounded delectable. Â
