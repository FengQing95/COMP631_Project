JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now let's talk ramen. I've had my fair share from cup noodles, to nongshim shin ramyun. A self made ramen expert. I got the spicy umami miso ramen soup. The website says ramen is all about the broth..and the broth was pretty amazing. The flavor has many layers, and it leaves you feeling satisfied after every mouthful. The noodles itself were pretty average, but I think the broth definitely makes the dish. You get a good size bowl and surprisingly the add ons are a decent price. My only real complaint is their levels of spicy really not being that spicy. I'd be nice if they expanded that scale so hot actually meant hot.
