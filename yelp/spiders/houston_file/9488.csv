JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place has the best ramen in Houston! They have such a good selection of ramen even if you have never had it before. They also have curry and some cool side dishes in case you're not a ramen fanatic! The staff is always so outgoing and lovely! The whole restaurant is always packed with amazing people and the environment is very cool! I recommend this place to people who love ramen and who have never tried it ! They offer extra noodles, veggies, and meat in case you love ramen and could eat more!
