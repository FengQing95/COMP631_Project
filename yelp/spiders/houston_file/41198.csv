Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yum yum YUM!  I have heard about this place for several years and wanted to try.  When we could not wait for a table at Backstreet because my flight was in several hours, we scooted here and ordered five items and three drinks.  The torta was delicious.  Our four other items failed to arrive, but we asked and a manager promptly brought them to us in a box, refunded one item that sold out, and gave us two free cookies.  You couldn't ask for better service than that during a Sunday morning brunch rush.  The food was amazing - one of the best pain au chocolat I have eaten i the USA (and my friend who accompanied me who also has lived in France agreed).  The torta was excellent, and we wished we had ordered more of the hot food to try.  Can't wait to go back during my next trip to Houston!
