Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My friend and I came to check this place out while visiting Houston, and we could not get over how amazing this place is! From the decor to the food, everything is sure to not disappoint. We got the biscuits and gravy with a couple of lattes and we loved it!
