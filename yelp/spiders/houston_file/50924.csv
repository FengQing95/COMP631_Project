Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////SO GOOD! My friend insisted that we do "Sunday Funday" in Houston so we started off here for brunch. Parking is okay, there's a small lot and plenty of street parking. The wait is pretty long, my date & I got there around 1pm & were told the wait would be 1hr to 1hr & 15mins. We waited about 45mins. It was worth it. We chilled in the car & took pictures in the area to pass the time.
