Uchi////The finale is the fried milk. This one is to die for. There are two pieces of fried milk that is crunchy and gooey in the inside. There is the milk sorbet which by its own is already a great dessert. You can really tastes the milk by itself. There is also a chocolate mousse. The combination of the mousse and milk sorbet is good but the mousse by itself is a bit heavy. There are also bits of what seem like crushed cornflakes that gives it a bit of a crunch.
