Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First time trying Snooze, have to start off by saying that it definitely lives up to the hype. We got there around 9:45am on a Tuesday (during Spring break) and it was that packed,yet. After ordering our food the line stated to pile up. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good brunch place with yummy bloody Mary's and mimosas. I recommend the French toast neat,but have to say that it is a little too much on the sweet side. Especially with the syrup and mascarpone,so go easy on that if you do try it.
