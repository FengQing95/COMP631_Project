JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////A friend and I went to JINYA on a last minute whim and were able to get a seat at the community table without a reservation. The restaurant does appear to be following social distancing rules and wearing face masks & gloves. I saw someone post a picture of the Karaage Ramen which is what brought me in so I got it, and it did not disappoint. The ramen was very flavorful, I got mine spicy and the kick was mild so if you want really spicy make that clear. I like the amount of noodles they put in the ramen, for me those are usually the first to go but there was a good amount to last through the meal. We also tried the caramelized Cauliflower small plate per waitress recommendation and it was very good. I could have eaten the full plate alone. It has a lemony garlic flavor to it. Would definitely come back!
