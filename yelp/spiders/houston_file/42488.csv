Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pistachio Tart with fresh raspberries $7 - Just alright. You definitely tasted the pistachios but it wasn't a sweet dessert as I had craved for. The raspberries were tart of course, but I think if it was lightly coated with sugar, it would have been better.
