JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I got the chicken spicy ramen and added fried onion, the poached egg, and corn to it. I got it "hot". The broth was pretty good- but a little plain like most other ramen bowls I've tried. The noodles were thin and perfectly cooked. That egg tho! So beautifully poached and still runny on the inside- probably should have just ordered a whole bowl of those.
