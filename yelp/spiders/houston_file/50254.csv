Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The decor is very simple and pretty. Various seating inside and outside with also bar seats. Their menu is very extensive and enticing. I didn't know what to go for as everything sound really good! I got Juan's Breakfast Tacos and added avacado and Barbacoa meat. Delicious!! My cousin went for their Egg Benedict which looked amazing. We cleaned our plates. We also ordered the OMG French Toast which was perfectly balanced with our meal. It tasted like pound cake in creamy goodness, topped with strawberries and subtle coconut shreds. Then I ordered the Dirty Chai (without the alcohol) to go.
