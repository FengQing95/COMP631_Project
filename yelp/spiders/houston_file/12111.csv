JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Austin - Thank you for your review. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us, but regret that you weren't overly fond of the Cha Cha Cha. Please know that we are always happy to remake your bowl, or offer you another option if you're not completely satisfied with your meal. We hope to serve you again soon.
