Uchi////Patrick was our waiter, very encouraging for us to order everything, in true waiter fashion. We ordered the brussel sprouts from the tastings section. You should know that no matter how much you order everything comes out one at a time. I think it is based on the order of their position on the menu. I strongly dislike this method. I guess it is cool, but my sister and I literally finished each portion in less than three minutes. It doesn't help that the portions are meant to feed a toddler. It is probably just a marketing strategy that makes you more inclined to order more food. Smart on their end, an annoyance on mine. We ordered hamachi, unagi, sake, yoka, hama chilii berry and something else Patrick recommended. I think we also had the spicy crunchy tuna roll. For dessert they ran out of the fried milk. Why this always happens to me? I am not sure. I was comped for some less exciting dessert. My sister reordered another roll after this.
