JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The place is always jamming. The decor is nice with lots of group sitting. We tend to sit at ramen bar in the back facing the kitchen. Still not a bad seat. My favorite is the spicy pork. They cook the pork very well. The broth is probably a 3.5 out of 5. When living in Australia there was a high concentration of Japanese and the selection of ramen was huge so I've had some amazing ramen. But, they aren't bad and I visit often.
