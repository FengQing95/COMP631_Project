Uchi////By far best Asian food ever! I loved this place, You have to go to this place and have this delicious dishes. The plates are a combination of flavors that I had never tried before. Prices might seem high if you compare it with all the others regular restaurant in Houston but if you are talking about nation wide, my husband and I had payed a lot more for a meal and had not got the quality of food you get in this place. Definitely a great experience words can not describe
