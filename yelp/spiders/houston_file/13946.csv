JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This seems like a hidden place during a quiet afternoon in midtown. While everyone else seemed dead I was surprised to walk in and this place was packed. We were sat at a table along the wall next to some annoying teenagers who were taking selfies and gossiping the entire time. Â The pork potstickers were good, and the sauces at the table were equally as delicious. I had the chicken wonton ramen, and was surprised at how filling it was. There were 6 large wontons in it which made it nice, thinking that my partner only had 2 slices of chicken in his bowl. Service was okay, our waitress was a little slow and the food took unusually long to come out. But overall I'd say it was a decent experience and I would most likely be back again.
