The Pit Room////The aforementioned Black's BBQ is perhaps the most legendary of Lockhart's bovine gold deposits, worth a stop for dinner even when I was nearly full already from lunch, and I might safely say that I found its Houston rival/equivalent today. Everyone in my party agreed they wanted to come back and try more dishes, from traditional to modern twists, and I myself would like to come back for the enormous beef rib, a whopping $22 as a dinner but eminently worth the occasional splurge. Because for my cash, there are few equals to The Pit Room in Houston and I would recommend it even to out-of-towners.
