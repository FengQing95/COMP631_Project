Uchi////How have I never reviewed Uchi!  I love it SO much!!!  We recently had their omakase for 2 & picked it up via curbside pickup.. the pickup experience was very smooth.  You book a pickup time online & they call you to take your order.  When I arrived there was someone in the parking lot checking us in & directing everyone to a parking spot.  I waited maybe 10 min for the food to arrive.  The food itself was amazing, as always!
