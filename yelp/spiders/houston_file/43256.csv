Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great bakery!  Everything tastes really good here!  Worth the wait in line when its busy on the weekends.  The weekend brunch is really good too.  The mimosas can do better though.  I especially like the richness and subtle sweetness of all the desserts.  My favorite is the buckwheat baguettes!  They don't always have them though.
