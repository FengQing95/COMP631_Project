Local Foods////I ordered the roast beef and crunchy chicken sandwiches. I would recommend them both highly! Don't let the price stop you from achieving full mouth bliss with these generously portion sandwiches and remember 2 sides are included in that price. While I thought of the sides to be tasty, to me, they were appreciated more as palate cleansers to go back to the star of my dish- Dat sandwich!
