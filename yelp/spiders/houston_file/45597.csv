Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We were not fortunate enough to find parking so we parked in the neighborhood nearby and walked, which wasn't a far walk by any means. When I first walked up to this place there was a line out the door on Sunday morning around 9. I didn't mind because knew it was going to be worth the wait because of all the positive reviews. This definitely proved to be true!
