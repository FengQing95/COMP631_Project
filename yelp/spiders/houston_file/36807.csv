Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Bosscat is a very modern bar with eclectic decor. The drinks are very nice and affordable although the crowd seams like more of a foreign car club. This is very noticeable from the parking lot. The valet is nice. I recommend casual dress. They have food as well. I haven't tried. The bar stays open a little later than the kitchen. Good spot for a date.
