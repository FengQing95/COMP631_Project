Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I ordered the Benny Duo with one steak and eggs benedict and one classic smoked salmon benedict along with a cold brew iced coffee. The cold brew was smooth, a far cry from the bitter cold brew from your average Starbucks. The entree was wonderful; poached egg done to perfection with a decadent hollandaise sauce. Snooze really knows how to offset the richness of the egg and hollandaise with their garnishes. The capers and sun dried tomato garnish on the smoked salmon benedict added that perfect acidic bite, and the gremolata on the steak and eggs benedict was really nice.
