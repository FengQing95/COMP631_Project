Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We ordered the cornbread that domes with sea salt butter. The cornbread kind of reminded me of jiffy butt not as sweet. They are small pieces that were kind of cold (would have been better warm). The butter must be mixed with the sea salt flakes as they come on top and would be overly salty if not.
