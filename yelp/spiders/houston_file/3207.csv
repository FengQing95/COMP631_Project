JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came here late a few nights ago for the first time. The food was excellent, and the service quick. I wasn't starving, so only ordered the spicy chicken ramen with poached egg added. Despite not being that hungry I ate ALL of it. I'm looking forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu!
