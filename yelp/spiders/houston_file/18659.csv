Uchi////To be honest, Uchi is one of those restaurants you just HAVE to try (before you die) and you have to assess it yourself, whether you love it enough to wait and pay the prices or not. There isn't enough beautiful words that I can string together to explain my experience or the recommendations above. Not only is the food impeccably satisfying, but the service is pretty great too. There's not much else you can ask for when you already have good food, good service, and good company.
