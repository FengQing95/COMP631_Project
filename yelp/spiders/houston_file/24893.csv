Uchi////Came back a second time to try their cheaper fare. Not nearly as much nigiri/sashimi, but we were able to try their creations with sushi. We ordered everything on the happy hour (except the yuca frites) and were happy with the consistency of quality of food from the omakase to the happy hour. The waitress was very keen on our needs and everything was cleaned up very quickly during these COVID-19 times. For dishes, we enjoyed the Murder Point Oysters ($2 per) immensely, followed by the Tempura Walu Walu ($6), Walu Walu ($8), and Hama Chili ($6). Wasn't too keen on the pork belly ($8) but I did appreciate the presentation and creativity on the dish. We also ordered the gyutoro ($10/piece), Scallop ($5.50/piece), Salmon Toro ($4.50/piece), and Amberjack ($8/piece) off the regular menu because it was just that good from last time.
