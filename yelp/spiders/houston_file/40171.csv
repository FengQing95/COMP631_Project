Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Came in on a Saturday mid afternoon. For two people, there was a 35 minute wait. We found a spot at the bar and then the mobile wait list showed we would have been seated at a table after about 15 minutes. We opted to stay at the bar, and easily took our name off the list by just responding to the texting system. This was a nice feature.
