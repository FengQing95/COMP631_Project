Uchi////Our waiter was interesting, as he was knowledgable about the restaurant and the different dishes...but when it came to accomodating certain things, he was no less than resilient. As my friend has certain food sensitivities (celiac and lactose intolerant) we asked if a dish could be made without rice or just a slightly modified (we would have paid extra). The waiter immediately turned our question down and went into a lecture about how the chefs carefully crafted the experience, etc.
