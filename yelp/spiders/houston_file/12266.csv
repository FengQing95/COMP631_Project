JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA has a vegan ramen, and they do it well. Their food is so flavorful. I asked for food recommendations while here in Houston and almost everyone said JINYA. It did not disappoint. If you love ramen, vegan or not, they have options and they're spectacular. I'll be back next time I'm in Houston.
