Uchi////There is a reason why your sushi and dishes consistently shows up on the best of anything food related list. Everything from your Brussels sprouts (a vegetable that I once hated), to your hamachi nabe, to that foie gras nigiri (OMG THAT FOIE GRAS) is simply delectable. You also have one the best wait staff in the city. When I think of the most magical place on Earth, I no longer think of Disney but of you. I only want to celebrate if it involves Uchi. It's like I've joined a cult. I can no longer imagine what the world would be like without you.
