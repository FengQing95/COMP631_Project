Local Foods////I've eaten at Local Foods about 10 times including a takeout salad today.  Whether you order a salad, a sandwich or one of their specials, the food is always very fresh and very delicious.  The staff is consistently a cut above- both friendly and responsive.  Don't forget to order some bread particularly the pretzel roll.  Very tasty.
