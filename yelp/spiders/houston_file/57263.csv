Kata Robata////Lobster Mac&cheese: did not expect this to be so good! I was so savory and chewy! It had the right amount of burnt top which I liked. I would arguably say it's the best mac&cheese in houston. If you are eating but want to end the meal full, this is definitely a great dish to end it with!
