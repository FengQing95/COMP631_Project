The Pit Room////Hands down my favorite BBQ spot in town. I've been to many many award winning BBQ spots in Texas (Franklins, Gatlins, Snows, and others) and I can assure you that the Pit Room is at the top of that list. The shared meals are fun to split with a group friends and the wonderful service keeps me coming back. Even the pickle bar is next-level! There is nothing better than a plate of their brisket and sausage with a couple of sides and Big Red to wash it down. I recommend this place to all of my friends who are visiting Houston. Â
