Uchi////I came in for happy hour with a girlfriend to try their various menu items. We arrived a little after 5 and didn't take  too long to be seated on the right side of the restaurant at the tables near the sushi bar. Our waiter was a handsome guy  with tattoos ;). He was very attentive and made some great suggestions.
