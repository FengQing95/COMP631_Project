Kata Robata////Overall, one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Houston.. easily. I give it one less star because I don't think their happy hour is on par with other sushi restaurants. I base my ratings solely on Kata versus similar establishments. Beef up that happy hour and maybe a slight reduction in price and I would change to a full 5 star rating.
