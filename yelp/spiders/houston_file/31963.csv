Local Foods////1. Truffled Egg Sandwich - To no fault of its own, I was not as blown away by this one (side note: this was right when the truffle oil craze was going on, and I was so tired of anything truffle esque). I think this was my first time actually ever having egg salad, sorry I grew up in an Asian household, where the first instinct to utilize a boiled egg was not to mix it with mayo. Now that I am back on the truffle band wagon I would give this sandwich - 3.5 stars
