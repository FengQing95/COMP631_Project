Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We came here for Sunday Brunch and man was this disappointing. I got the Maui Meatloaf and it was extremely salty with no actual flavor. The sunny side egg was raw and had the whites running with the yolk. Bland and no redeeming qualities to the food that was served. Additionally, the shrimp and grits had small pieces of shrimp that wasn't cleaned and still had the veins dangling out. However, our server was great and kept us in a good mood.
