Local Foods////So- we went in for dinner and the menu we were given didn't look vegan friendly at all.  I asked about a few of the menu items I had seen online- just to see if they had them some days or some weeks or something (like the vegan chili...they did not have this...) and the lady behind the counter seemed very rude- and provided no direction for us as we told her that we were vegan.  They only had a tofu based sandwich (excuse me...is the tofu local as well?) and salads or a sandwich in which you would have to remove items from in order to have a vegan dish (besides just a plate of sides or something- I thought about that.)  We eventually left the restaurant without purchasing anything.
