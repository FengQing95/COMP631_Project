Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Best croissants I've ever had in my life!  I stopped by to pick up some pastries for friends and family.  The dining room was busy but the line moved quickly (the people in front of me in line were all picking up to-gos).  I picked up 3 different croissants, different cookies, kouign amanns, and kugelhopfs.  With the exception of the cookies (gave to friends so I didn't have any), everything was DELICIOUS, even to the next day!  I am not a bread/pastry/dessert person, and I LOVED everything.  Parking could somewhat be an issue; it was mid-afternoon when I went (slow time), and I had to circled around the block a few times before a parking spot opened up.  Highly recommend!
