Uchi////SERVICE: 3 stars. Our servers tried, but the pace of service was "pushy" and way too fast. We had the 6-course tasting along with other dishes and we were out of there in 90 minutes - they were  definitely working hard to cycle tables. As soon as we finished a dish, another one landed in our face. The rapid push  of food really did not make the experience very enjoyable. Another service snafu was that the wait staff "inadvertently" forgot to show us the happy hour menu until AFTER we had ordered most of our other food. A bit annoying -- especially since the beers were half price. We frequent Da Marco's and that is the benchmark for impeccable service.
