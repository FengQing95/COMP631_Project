Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I have to give this location the five stars they the deserve for the five star service we recived. I went there on a Sunday during what seems to always be their busy hour 12. I was with my wife, niece and nephew they quickly accommodated to our requests the waitress or someone else was always checking on us. The manager Maria checked on us multiple times to make sure we were getting the best experience possible even though she was extremely busy. It's good to see this kind of team work. Keep up the great work!
