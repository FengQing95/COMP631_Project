Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Their iced latte and macaroons are a must every time I go. I especially love the eggnog macaroons (seasonal). The service is great, staff is always so friendly, and accommodating to my toddler : ).  I do not eat the bread (I have allergies), but they will modify all sandwiches for me and their salads are wonderful also!  This place never disappoints!
