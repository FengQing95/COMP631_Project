The Pit Room////I think I found me a new go to spot for some good, finger licking BBQ! Had some Iowans in town and they wanted some good, Texas BBQ. Couldn't disappoint them and make Texas look bad, so I brought them here. This place is the bomb dot com. We were lucky enough to get the last pieces of brisket also. Lol. The people that came in after us were pretty pissed off. Side note, get there FIRST in case they RUN OUT OF FOOD!
