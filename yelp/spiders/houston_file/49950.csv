Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was greeted by a smiling hostess who informed me that the wait would be about 40 minutes (and I was okay with that). After about 40 minutes I was seated in a booth and my server "Tiny Dancer" (her name on my receipt) came over immediately. She had a huge smile on her face that made me want to hug her and say "Hey Girl Hey!" And she was on point...didn't miss a beat.
