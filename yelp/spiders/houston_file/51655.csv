Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've tried almost everything on the menu, but I would recommend any of their pancakes, eggs benedicts, or their SNOOZE BREAKFAST BURRITO. The breakfast burrito is huge, can easily feed 2-3 people, add in breakfast sausage on the inside, opt to get half of the green chili sauce and half of the ranchero sauce, utilize some of their yellowbird Serrano hot sauce, and you're set for a great morning.
