Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Who goes to brunch with out getting a mimosa or Bloody Mary? Definitely not a Expert Bruncher! They have a variety of different flavored mimosas, aside from your standard orange and cranberry. The lemonade mimosa was my pick of the day and it was quite refreshing. I'm not a Bloody Mary person myself, however my brunch date said it was great! I also saw an abundance of them being served!
