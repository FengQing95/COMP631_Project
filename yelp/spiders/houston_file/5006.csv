JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////You are absolutely right and I cannot agree with you more.  The Vegan Ramen was a hot seller and I have no idea why our corporate headquarters decided to change it a while back.  They tried to tweak the recipe and packaging and it turned out to be a disaster.  After they shipped us the new product, we tested it and customers continuously sent it back stating it doesn't taste right.  As a franchise owner, I immediately pulled the the Vegan Ramen off and notified Corporate that something was very wrong.  They did a recall of all the Vegan Ramen for every Jinya Ramen Bar restaurant and have since gone back to their original supplier.  The original recipe and formula is currently back in production and we should be getting back on our menu towards the end of March.  I apologize that you were disappointed and I can tell you firsthand that I was even more disappointed being that I was unable to offer my guests the Vegan Ramen that they crave.  Here is my personal cell number:  650-906-6308.  Text me towards the end of the month and ask if the Vegan Ramen is in.  I'll quickly reply and give you an update.  When you visit, as for my managers Keith, Wynne, Sara or Raul and I'll be glad to buy you a bowl of the Spicy Vegan Ramen to make up for this last visit.
