JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ever since we had ramen at Momofuku in New York, we have been searching for good ramen in Houston.  Jinya not only serves an excellent bowl of ramen, but they have an excellent fried chicken. The chicken is juicy, has a wonderful soy based marinate and crunchy exterior. Splash some fresh lemon, and you need nothing else. Whichever ramen you choose, the broth is amazing. I ordered the pork and my wife ordered the chicken. Both are equally deep and complex in their flavor and very satisfying.  We had Mochi for Dessert. Nothing fancy, but a nice way to end our meal. In total, we had two appetizers, two bowls of ramen, and dessert. Total price 48.00 with tip. A very nice meal at an affordable price.
