Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze is just a quick jaunt from my house, so day after day as I walk my dog, walk over to Define, or drive past, I see the long line and think to myself: seriously? It cannot be worth it. I am happy to proven wrong as of this morning. It is worth it. (Caveat: we did not have to wait more than 2 minutes for a table so I can't speak to the 1.5+ wait times that we've been quoted on our two previous attempts to visit.) We arrived at 7:35 and there was no wait. By 7:41 we heard the hostess start quoting 15-20 minutes so 7:30 appears to be the sweet spot.
