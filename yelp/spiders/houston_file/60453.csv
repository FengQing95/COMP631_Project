Baby Barnaby's////As many others have mentioned, portions are quite generous. Go with it, since the food is so good! Definitely lots of comfort breakfast foods to be found--pancakes, waffles, hash browns (southern home fries, to be exact --my fave!), honey butter biscuits, and eggs made however you like them. (Scrambled with a little cheese, please!) If you want to start the day a little healthier, they have lots of other options--the low fat, high protein breakfast burrito, egg whites, green eggs (try them, and you'll like them, I say!)--there's something for just about everyone here.
