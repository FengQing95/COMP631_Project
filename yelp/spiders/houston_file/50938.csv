Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is a complete mixed bag for me. We waited 30 minutes at 8 a.m. on a Sunday, which wasn't awful, but the space is cramped. The person at the counter takes your number so they text you when the table is ready, which is a great feature, but she messed up 3/3 numbers she took that I listened to. That's impressively bad.
