Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Went here to grab a snack & drinks for the first time the other day.  It is in the new center off Midlane, so I knew it was not going to be inexpensive.  I really think they are confused and believe they are in NYC.  $14 for their specialty cocktails (their version of an old fashioned) and beers range from $8 bottle of Coconut Ale Maui Brewery to $6 Coors light bottle.  This price does not include tax & tip. They just seem a little too proud of what they offer
