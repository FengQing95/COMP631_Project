Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Five days into its existence I decided to go and try it. It was Sunday morning just before 10am. My friend went to stand in line while I parked. Parking was somewhat a pain but pretty typical for the area. Ended up parking a couple blocks away, but it was easily walkable. My friend was told a 1.5 hour wait, and gave her number so they could text when they could seat us. To kill time we went to the Walgreens across the street. That 90 minute wait was actually an hour and ten minute wait.
