Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Pastries were pretty amazing but expensive. I also think the place is a little too small combined with a lack of organization amongst staff. They seem to always be a little confused as to what the other is doing. There was a 15 minute wait time for lattes the other day....not cool. Â They forget details like refilling the forks or bringing butter and jam with your bread. For what they charge these kinks should be worked out to justify the price.
