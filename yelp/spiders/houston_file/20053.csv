Uchi////The service here was generally good. Our principal waiter was excellent. He seemed very engaged in the menu, describing the dishes, and offering recommendations. The other staff seemed a little confused, even bringing out the wrong dish one time. Apparently they're supposed to explain each dish in detail because we had one person run off to find his notes to read them to us. We read the menu, dude; we know what we ordered. We don't want to sit here waiting for you to come back and read it to us again.
