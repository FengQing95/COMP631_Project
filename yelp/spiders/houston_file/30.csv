Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was looking forward to visiting based on the news prior to opening. The ambience is nice and on a nice day the atmosphere is nice and relaxing. The menu Has a creative twist on some favorite classics, However, I found this restaurant to be extremely overpriced. First, their menu options are limited. I went for lunch on a Saturday and after awhile of reviewing the menu and not seeing anything that jumped out, I settled for the Cuban pork sandwich or Bosscat press. It was good, but was it $14.00 good? No, it was not. In addition, all the sides are ala carte so the fries to go with my sandwich were an extra $6. Granted the portion for the fries were large and can be shared and they were good, I think it could be priced better. The drinks...unless you settle for house wine, there is not drink on the menu less than 12.00. Their specialty cocktails start at 14.00. Yeah I understand this is supposed to be a craft specialty whiskey venue, but I did not taste anything worth the price in my drink and I will pay for a good drink. My suggestions for improvement would be to expand the menu, include some bar bites and happy hour pricing.
