Kata Robata////It was my 1st first time there and I'm highly impressed. There are so many options to choose on the menu and each dish (that we ordered) was delicious and beautifully presented. Sushi are extremely fresh. I love the ambiance. Waiter was very nice and knowledgeable as well. Make sure to reserve a table ahead of time. I wish they can upgrade their tables, which would boost up their elegance to where they want to achieve. We sat at a booth, table was very usual with several burn marks on top.
