Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Wow!!! We loved our food and our server, Victor!! (Thank you Victor if you see this!) I took my friend here for her birthday brunch and everything went so great, I'm very happy about choosing this place. If you have dietary restrictions like not being able to eat dairy, they are very accommodating which I appreciate. Even on my friend's surprise birthday brownie slice, they whipped up non-dairy whipped cream for her, which is going above and beyond. Anyway, the food was delicious and we adored our server. Also the wall of whiskey is gorgeous too. A+ service, delicious food. Highly recommend
