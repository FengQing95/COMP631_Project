JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I believe they have the best Takoyaki in town. I tried spicy chicken ramen, Tonkotsu black, they are both awesome. The noodle is perfectly cooked and the broth is very flavorful. The ambience is modern and well decorated. The server is great and attentive. It is well worth to try.
