Baby Barnaby's////Amazing breakfast! I visited Baby Barnaby's on a Saturday after running in Race for the Cure. It was definitely crowded and we waited for something near 40 minutes to get seated. So I'm not sure if it was my hunger from the wait that made me order half the menu, but I did. I got the french toast which comes by itself so I had to get a side of eggs and potatoes and some freshly squeezed orange juice. Well that french toast was the bomb and the way I scarfed it down you could definitely tell. The potatoes were pretty good, not "the best ever" but good in its own right.. and the eggs were good too. The fresh orange juice comes with free refills so go ahead and order that! I hate getting drinks that I have to pay for refills so they won me over with that. I will definitely be back to Baby Barnaby's... hopefully soon! Next time I'm getting the Migas... I tried a bite of my friends and was in love. Yay for Baby Barnaby's!
