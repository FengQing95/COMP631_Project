Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Since my first visit to Common Bond i've been looking forward to trying breakfast. When I got to the ordering counter I didn't know what to order. I was torn between the biscuits and gravy, the breakfast sandwich and the soft scramble. I went with the soft scrambled eggs and I was not disappointed. The serving looks small and I was initially disappointed when it arrived but the amount of food is very deceiving. I can eat quite a bit of food and the soft scramble was more than enough food, I was actually pretty full after. The eggs were rich, creamy and cheesy. The accompanying bread/toast is perfect to have eggs put on. The only thing that I wasn't to much of a fan of was the sauteed greens on the eggs. I like bitter leafy greens in their own right but it was not a great pairing with the eggs.
