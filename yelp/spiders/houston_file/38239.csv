Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Decided to stop in for a quick lunch. I got the pulled pork hush puppies & the Seoul steak bowl. Was not a fan of the hush puppies. They were lacking in flavor & the dipping sauce was not good. The Seoul bowl was good. Overall was a little under whelmed. The pics from the brunch looked really good & maybe that's the best time to go.
