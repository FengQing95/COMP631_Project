Kata Robata////First, let me say they have amazing food. That's about it. From the moment we walked in we were not greeted with 4 people at the door. Second, we sat down. Waited and waited no server. Finally got served drinks and food were another 20 min wait. Usually we sit take our time to eat the whole process took over 2 hours for just apps. I would try it again. Still disappointed. Not really sure if I would want to come back.
