Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////OK, enough of that.  The breads, pastry's, and croissants are out of this world good.  I really enjoyed my latte as well, which for me is impressive.  Brunch menu is really interesting.  I went with the roast veal and sweetbreads.  The veal was stringy, and tough to chew on.  The sweetbreads by themselves are amazing, and are a little strange if you have never had them.  Though it came in this odd greasy broth that did not agree with me.  I would recommend the sweetbreads at Coltivare or Mockingbird before you try these however.  The rest of the brunch menu looks really good, so I will have to give them a try next time.
