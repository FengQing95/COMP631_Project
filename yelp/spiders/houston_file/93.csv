Uchi////I have been to Uchi and Uchiko in Austin and absolutely loved the inventiveness and deliciousness of there menu items.  They even have a good wine list.  I recommend the crunchy tuna, the wagyu short ribs and the hama chili,  If they get the Wagyu beef that is a def must try even though it is $10 a piece.  It is worth it bc it is so tender.  I recommend making a reservation or going there for hh!  You might have to make your reservations well in advance and at odd times to get one!
