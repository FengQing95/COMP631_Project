JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Julio - Thanks for your review. I'm glad you have noticed improvement. If you have ever worked in the restaurant industry, you would know that change and improvement does not come without a lot of pain, blood, sweat and tears. We may never be the best in everyone's eyes, but it is still the goal we will strive for on a daily basis. As a wise man once told me, sometimes the goals worth striving for the most are the ones that are unattainable. Thank you again, and we wish you happiness and prosperity in 2017.
