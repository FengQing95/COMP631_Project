Kata Robata////Fresh, quality sushi with great atmosphere to dine with friends. This is one of my top choices in Houston because I know exactly what to expect when ordering. The sashimi and nigiri pieces are on point, if not beyond my expectations every time. I usually enjoy the omakase here while dining at the sushi bar because I have total faith in the chef.
