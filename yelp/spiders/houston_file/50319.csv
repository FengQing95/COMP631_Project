Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////One of the best breakfast places in Houston! No reservations, but if you give them your cell phone number, you'll get a text as your table is almost ready, so you can walk around the area if you so desire. I always get their pancake flight and my dining partners always end up getting something savory, so the pancake almost serves as a dessert. For the flight, you can get a half portion of french toast - I have tried both their options and you can't go wrong with either! Some of my fave pancakes are the s'mores and key lime. I also love the spuds deluxe, and every eggs benedict dish I've tried was excellent.
