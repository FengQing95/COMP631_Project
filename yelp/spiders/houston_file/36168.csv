Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The name Gavin, was given to me. We took 3 drinks since we got here. And we're told we are being cut off. We have been here watching march madness, and are excited as such. They gave us the Impression that we are starting trouble and we are not. Please take this in consideration. This place is not friendly for a certain type of people. Have fun and be safe. Gavin, I came up to you and told you we o lay had 3 drinks and were a little excited because of March madness, but you refused to serve us because you thought we were under the influence because we were excited about the duke game and shouted out when they scored. I don't recommend this place to anyone.
