The Pit Room////Sn: ran into an employee named Nathaniel. He was super nice and talked our ear off lol (but in a good way). Told us some of the history of the Pit Room and the patio. Informed us that on Fri, Sat, Sun they also have people there that do a crab/crawfish boil. Which is definitely something I'd come back for, in addition to the BBQ of course. Also spoke very highly of the owner mentioning how great of a guy/boss he is.
