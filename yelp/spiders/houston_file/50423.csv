Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The only flaw I noticed about the restaurant was the wait time to be seated. Aside from that, the staff was fantastic, patient and very helpful when it came to making selections from their menu. I'm currently getting hungry thinking about my experience there. I can't wait to make another visit here.
