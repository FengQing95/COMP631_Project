JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The flavor of the broth was overwhelmingly porky and the noodles sucked up all that flavor and it was really heavy and thick. After taking a few bites, you don't want to eat anymore. You just get tired of the same taste building up in your mouth. I needed something light and even the extra order of the cabbage didn't do it. I won't be ordering this bowl of ramen again. I'll stick to the other dishes on the menu.
