Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Normally I don't frequent Common Bond because while I do really like their pastries and food, it can get expensive since everything is so tempting and prices add up (think ~$4 for a croissant). That being said, I recently found out a game changer that will definitely have me coming back more often!!:
