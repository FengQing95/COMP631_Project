Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome food. Husband and I went and recommended the bennies and the pancakes. Pqncakes were light and fluffy. The coffee was also very light and delicious. I will definitely come back again for breakfast only tip I will recommend is to get there early, Â we got there at 7:30 we have no wait. By the time we were out there was already a line so highly highly recommend for breakfast.
