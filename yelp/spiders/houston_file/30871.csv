The Pit Room////Had the brisket, pork ribs, beef sausage, and pork sausage with queso and a side of elote. They definitely go heavy on the seasoning and there's no need for sauce. Brisket was tender, pork ribs were soft and flavorful, and both improved with the unconventional addition of queso and some of their pickled onions. I thought the sausages were alright, but the brisket was definitely my favorite. I found the prices pretty reasonable for Texas BBQ, and if I was nearby I wouldn't think twice about stopping by to scratch an itch for brisket. Also, the queso was really good.
