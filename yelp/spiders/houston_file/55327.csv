Kata Robata////Solid food, but was expecting much better flavors from a highly praised chef and restaurant. Kobe Beef skewers we good, very tender melts in mouth, but lacked a a stronger flavor, if the chef wasnt aiming for explosive flavor I'm judging wrong. The foie gras and scallop sushi was ok, nothing special, had better quality scallop and foie gras. The kata special chirashi was mediocre as well. I did my best to focus on the tastes of the different fishes but couldn't tell much of a difference. Tonkotsu ramen was mediocre at best but the oxtail ramen was pretty yummy:) Overall I was disapointed in the quality of sushi, but its a solid place.
