Kata Robata////I tried the panicotta for dessert off my friends hrw menu. It was good, not too sweet but similar to tapioca pudding. The green tea banana cake wasn't that flavorful, moist or very fulfilling to my taste buds. The sorbet that comes with it gives you a sour kick in the mouth, be warned! Â
