Local Foods////Let s face it Houston has so many great restaurants. Competing for customers is a "bear" but Local Foods has nothing to worry about. Do you know why? They know what they are doing, they do it well and they do it with passion. First of all their food is    HEALTHY.. ...Did you hear that? HEALTHY, MEAN AND LEAN..now Houston is no longer the fattest city in the nation but we were up there last year. Do you want to find a place where you eat well, they treat you with a smile and kindness and you leave having eaten a healthy meal?  Come to local foods. You might run into me. I plan to visit often to fulfill my wellness plan!
