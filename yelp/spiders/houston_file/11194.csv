JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Everything is bigger in Texas, except the chicken wings at Jinya Ramen Bar... The chicken wings were the most embarassing chicken wings I have ever seen in my life.  My gf and I were shocked at how small the wings were.  They were adequately fried and the light curry powder seasoning was ok but wow were they small.  I almost wonder if the wings came from a quail.  They really need to take this off the menu or use normal size wings.
