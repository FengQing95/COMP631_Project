Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But this place is hands down 5 star for the food. The drunken monkey French toast was amazing. It is a warm, toasty bread served in two large pieces. Topped with pecans. To the eyes, it doesn't look very big but I couldn't finish it. It comes with a torched banana and it's as satisfying as a creme brûlée. No syrup needed for this one.
