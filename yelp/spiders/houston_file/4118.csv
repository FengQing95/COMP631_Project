JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We were very hungry when we arrived, so we ordered appetizers through desert and all of it was delicious. We started with edamame and the tempura brussel sprouts. The edamame was very good, but the brussel sprouts were AMAZING.   He had the spicy chicken ramen and I ordered the vegetarian ramen.  His ramen was very spicy, which he loved, but for people who don't eat spicy food, it could be a bit much. My vegetable ramen was not only beautiful to look at, it tasted great. The ramen is served in large bowls and there are plenty of noodles, but the broth is what really made both of our meals special. We ended our meal with almond pudding, which is served in a little cup with finely diced strawberries, kiwi, and what I think was either mango or peach, a dollop of fresh whipped cream and streuseled with a strong cherry sauce. It was very light and a very pleasant way to end a spicy meal. He also had the hot green tea, which he proclaimed as "the best green tea EVER." There was some green tea powder on the lip of the cup it was served in, so it is authentic Japanese green tea, not like the watery green tea they usually serve in a Chinese restaurant.
