Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My friend and I shared the drunk'n monkey french toast to end the brunch on a sweet taste. I like how the flavour was the right amount of sweetness and easy to eat. My only thing about it is I wished it was slightly fluffier/softer. Otherwise, I had a good time here plus the service was awesome! Come check this place out!
