Local Foods////Checking out Houston for the first time and decided on dinner using ye ol' faithful Yelp. This place popped up as one of the top rated and most reviewed places so I figured I had to give it a try. Based on reviews I had the get the chicken sandwich. The reviews are spot on, it was a decently large sandwich loaded with chicken but what really makes it deserving of 5 stars is the "crunch" factor. The nuts and chips they use elevate to the next level while still making the sandwich moderately healthy. For sides I tried the kale salad and pasta salad. The pasta salad was just alright and the kale was good but way too much dressing in my opinion. 5 stars is solely for the sandwich, but I would recommend trying some other sides.
