JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We love this place, both the Midtown location, and the one in Webster. Jim Wang knows how to run an excellent restaurant, with fresh, delicious ingredients, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and a funky, upscale atmosphere. The ramen here is legit and comes in several varieties. The apps and desserts are also not to be missed.
