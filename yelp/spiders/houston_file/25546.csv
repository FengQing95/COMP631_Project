Uchi////Their sushi is top notch and their selection is impressive, even in comparison to other high end joints. An experience like this brought me back to a time I tried a Michelin star in New York, but this time each piece has an amazing spin or accent. You know you've stepped into the right restaurant when they don't leave you a bottle of soy sauce at the table. With the omakase you will be met with palette cleansers between dishes and there will be a devised menu in which flavors should build onto each other. For Uchi, I can give a bow to their food. It's nothing short of amazing, but why I can't give it 5-stars is due to some items being inconsistent in quality and sometimes a rather predictable theme for the omakase (fruits and tangerines with everything), and in comparison to other joints, the price tag can be considered quite hefty.
