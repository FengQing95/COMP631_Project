Baby Barnaby's////Beyond great food (and a pancake the size of Texas itself), Barnaby's is a customer service gem. Sign your name to the signup sheet and designate whether your prefer inside or outside seating, then grab a cup of coffee and wait (not long) for your name to be called. The waitstaff is incredibly friendly and very accommodating. Even when my order wasn't put in by mistake, one of the waiters had a seat at my table and apologetically informed me that I had been missed somehow in the kitchen. He offered me a free bowl of fruit and minutes later I was seated in front of a piping hot plate of green eggs and apple sausage!
