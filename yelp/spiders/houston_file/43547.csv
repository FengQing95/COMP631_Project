Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I enjoyed every pastry I picked up from this bakery. I tried a few macaroons, a croissant, a piece of lemon cake, and a fruit and almond croissant. Each pastry was very solid, and I don't have much to complain about. It's 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't anything super spectacular, but definitely good.
