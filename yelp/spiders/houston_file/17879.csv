Uchi////For the main course, we had Walu Walu- escolar in Ponzu sauce.  It had a crunchy seared outer, and flaky interior, very tasty and one of my favorites.  Next was the foie gras sashimi- it melted in our mouthes incredible fusion of flavor, followed by the sasami yaki, an oak-grilled chicken breast with  lemon­grass and cilantro (this was really good, and a safe bet for those not adventuresome).
