Local Foods////The salads.  Don't think that you're short-changing yourself if you "just order a salad."  The Chopped Greens was full of health and heartiness.  The salad bowl is full of everything, not just the greens.  Oh, and these greens weren't the standard mixed baby greens with spinach, bland arugula, and chicories.  This mix was from Animal Farms, I believe.  What sort of greens?  Trust me, you haven't heard of half of them.   They are, however, the perfect balance of (not overpoweringly) bitter and nutty.  Then it's full of two types of raw grated beets, pine nuts, some farm eggs, chicken breast, and goat cheese.  I had to sub out the feta.  Order the dressing on the side - you won't really need it with all the flavors.  Maybe just a bit.
