Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Every time I try coming here, it is packed with people and I decide to just leave and go somewhere else. I just wish I could sit down and eat properly D': With that being said, I have had their desserts and they are delicious. I'm a big fan of the chocolate croissant and their macarons!! The macarons are large and stuffed with super flavorful ganache that actually matches the flavor of what the macaron should be. I just wish the bakery had more seating so that I can one day enjoy eating indoors. Will keep trying to come back to get a seat!!
