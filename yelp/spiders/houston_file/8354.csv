JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the signature Jin-ya bao ($3.95) and the spicy chicken ramen ($11.50, spicy level hot) and added an egg (+ $1.25) and a bottle of Perrier ($3.25).  With my order I received 2 thinly sliced pieces of chicken in my ramen, which still could not save the dish.  The bao was really good, the pork belly was tender and well seasoned, and the bao was soft and sweet, great pair, I'd give it a 4 out of 5. On the other hand, the ramen was not, I'd rate it a 2, and neither was the added egg.
