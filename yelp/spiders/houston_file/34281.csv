Local Foods////I enjoy the unique yet fresh sandwiches that are served at local foods. Even though parking can be horrible depending on the time you go...the food here makes it all worth it. I have tried their crunchy chicken sandwich before and was only able to finish half of it because it was so filling (in a way that's good cause now I have lunch for the next day). I love that their unique options can cater to the different appetites. Whether you just want to stop in for a small light meal or have something fill you up, this is the place to go. I also love that their decor creates a casual and relaxing vibe for diners to enjoy their meal. I will definitely come back again in the near future to try more items on their menu.
