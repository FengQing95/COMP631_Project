Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm not a big breakfast person, but this place is amazing. My girlfriend has always wanted to eat here. So I took the day off and came around 9 a.m. And we waited about 15 min before we were seated. I got the chilaquiles Benedict and it was amazing!! I would highly recommend coming back.
