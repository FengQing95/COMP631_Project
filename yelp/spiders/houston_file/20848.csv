Uchi////My favorite sushi restaurant in Houston! Very modern contemporary cuisine along with outstanding service. Super quaint, cozy joint! It's a bit pricey but worth every bite! It's always packed and reservations are only available days in advanced. However they always leave a certain amount of tables for walk ins so the wait isn't too bad. They also hand out complimentary edamame and small bites in the waiting area. Go for social hour too. The line starts to form before 5.
