Uchi////5.) Fried Milk - This dessert is the cherry on top at Uchi.  After a long, fulfilling meal, the best way to close out is a serving of fried milk.  Complete with flaky, toasted milk that melts as soon as you bite into it, coupled with chocolate moose and iced milk sherbet, this is a unique dessert that wraps up the perfect meal.
