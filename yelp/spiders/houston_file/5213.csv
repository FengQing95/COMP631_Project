JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Luther, Thank you for your review. We appreciate any and all feedback, though to address your critique of our noodles, our default cook time for our noodles is al dente. We can always cook them longer according to preference (ask for "soft noodles"), and each ramen can be prepared to varying degrees of customization.
