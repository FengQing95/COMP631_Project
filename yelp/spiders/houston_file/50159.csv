Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////From first glance of the menu, we didn't know where to start. There was so much to choose from and everything looked good. We ended up ordering the Breakfast Pot Pie ($9.25), Snooze Spuds Deluxe ($11.25), and Pancake Flight ($9.50). Everything was amazing! My favorite was the Breakfast Pot Pie. It's basically a flakey crust pastry layered under a flavorful gravy sauce with sunny side eggs on top! It was so good and it also came with crispy hash browns that went really well with the four different condiments/hot sauces they provide. My next favorite are the pancakes. I highly recommend ordering the Pancake flight because it allows you to choose any combination of three pancakes or French toast! This let's you try a lot more! We got pineapple Pancake, drunken monkey French toast, and blueberry danish pancake. Everything was really good! I highly recommend going with a friend who likes sharing too because you get to try more food. My girl and I swapped plates halfway through to tag team and demolished everything. Totally worth it.
