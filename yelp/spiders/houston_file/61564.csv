Baby Barnaby's////Green Eggs & Ham: I got this because it seemed to be a staple here and it was a great choice! The eggs are creamy and scrambled with spinach and artichoke and other greens, but it tastes delicious! It pairs pretty well with the toasted bread that you're given if you spread the egg on top. The potatoes are just the right size and amount of crunchy. The sausage was pretty flavorful, but overall I'm not a huge fan of sausage so I can't judge it well.
