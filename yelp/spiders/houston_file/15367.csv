JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Tiffany - Thanks for your review. Please know that three years ago when I decided to invest in this restaurant concept, the notion of "hype" was furthest from my mind. I thought the market in Houston was lacking an established ramen concept, so I followed up on JINYA's franchising opportunities as the brand had proven itself successful in the Los Angeles market.
