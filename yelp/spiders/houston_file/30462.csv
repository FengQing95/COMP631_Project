The Pit Room////Pit barbecue refers to a method in which the meat is cooked underground. So a hole is dug in the ground and lined with stones (could also be brick, sand and could also be leaves or a combination), which is the same style used in Hawaii when you see a pig being dug out at a luau. This barbecue method allows the heat to be retained, which results in a very tender and fall off the bone meat (the method is similar to use of a smoker).
