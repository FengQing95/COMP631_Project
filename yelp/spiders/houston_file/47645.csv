Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was AMAZE BALLS!!!! One word!!...... TERESSA!! The food was great! Best Hash Browns I've ever had!! But my server really made my day and went above and beyond. Can't thank her enough. The little things really do matter at this restaurant. First time here and I will definitely come back again and tell all my friends about this place.
