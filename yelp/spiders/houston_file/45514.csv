Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There were an array of delectable choices on the menu and I had a difficult time coming to a decision. The cashier was quite friendly and helpful and assisted me in choosing the steak frites. The steak was perfectly cooked and accompanied by shoestring parmesan fries. In addition to the entree, I tried the lamb chop appetizer. It was only two chips, so it was truly a small plate, but the lamb chops were served with fresh arugula and feta, along with what I believe to be a hummus and some sort of fruit jam/ reduction sauce. All of the flavors complemented each other and came together exceptionally well. I can't wait to return again
