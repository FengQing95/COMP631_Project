Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I will have to say that this may not be a fair review because I'm comparing this Snooze to the one in Austin.  After visiting Austin and trying the Snooze there a group of friends and I decided to try this one in Houston.  We were very disappointed.  The wait was unnecessarily long.  We literally saw a few tables open for up to 10 minutes without anyone being seated.  When I asked management about why the tables were open he said that people are given 7-10 minutes to claim their tables.  The drinks were weak and the food didn't taste as good.  Won't be back unless they bring trainers in from Austin to shape up the place.
