Uchi////This place is amazing! Best sushi in town. Great experience! The staff is really nice, but the wait can be a little long (1 hour) so make reservations. The food is omg-where-can-I-start. Everything is correctly flavored, the fish is fresh, and the ambience is perfect. If it's your first time there, the waiters will choose plates based in your preferences, and is super helpful. This is a must try!
