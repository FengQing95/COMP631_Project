Kata Robata////Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in H! I've been going here for years and I always enjoy the food (even though my favorite chef, Mark Medina is gone). One of the absolute favorite dishes here are the bone marrow, kobe beef skewers, lobster mac-n-cheese, and ramen! Before Mark left to Soma, he would make me the absolute best UNI pasta ever. I love, love the food here. Writing this review makes my mouth water.
