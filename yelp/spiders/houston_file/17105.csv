JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Jinya bun is a must, the crunchiness and freshness of the cucumber balances out the deep flavor of the pork and the fluffiness of the bun. The Jinya Tonkatsu Black has a deep umami flavor, Â the marinated egg that's included is creamy and the best I've had. Only four stars because the prices need to be updated on here.
