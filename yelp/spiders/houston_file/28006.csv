The Pit Room////Amazing new barbecue place. The best ribs and brisket ever! Opening day and it's packed and everyone seems happy and enthusiastic. The beans are also exceptional. I had the two meat dinner with two sides and had to take half home. I will definitely be back and so will everyone else it seems, so come early.
