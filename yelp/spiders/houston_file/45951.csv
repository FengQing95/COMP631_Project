Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't believe it took me so long to review, because I love everything about this place! The building is white, bright, and beautiful with lots of room. Their pastries, desserts and bread are all amazing with my favorite being the huge chocolate chip walnut cookie. I've had many cookies in my life and this cookie is my favorite in Houston. The only other cookie that I would say is better is the chocolate chip walnut cookie at Levain in New York (I feel that cookie might have inspired common bond's). It's huge, soft, chewy, heavy, not too sweet, and walnuty. Another bakery item that I love are the croissants. The almond croissants are delicious and when those run out, even the regular croissants are great as well. They're huge, puffy, and have endless layers.
