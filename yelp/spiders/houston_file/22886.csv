Uchi////Okay, maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but this is honestly the only time I've ever been disappointed by an omakase. The portions are ridiculously tiny, and the majority of the dishes they made for us weren't even fish! To be fair, those non-sushi dishes were enjoyable, but nothing memorable and definitely not what should have dominated the omakase. Even the actual nigiri was pretty underwhelming. Many of them were very bland or tasteless, and it almost felt like the chef was just giving us "interesting-sounding" fish that other customers weren't ordering.
