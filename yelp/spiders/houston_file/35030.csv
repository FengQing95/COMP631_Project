Local Foods////The service is pretty good.  Overall a decent experience but it was over $30 for lunch for two and it just seems a little too precious, and they price accordingly.  I'm not a fan of precious, I guess.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie "Precious: Based on the Novel "Push" by Sapphire" but things that are precious (stones, moments, memories, and few, etc) are things of which I'm not fond.
