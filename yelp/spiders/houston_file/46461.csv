Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had the butternut squash soup, which was topped with pumpkin seeds and sour cream. Loved the creaminess! My sister-in-law got the quiche florentine, which came with a side salad. I had a piece of the quiche and it was delicious. She enjoyed the french onion soup too. My husband had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. It was moist and crunchy but the chicken was small. There was more bun than chicken.
