The Pit Room////We were looking for Texas BBQ and we got Texas BBQ. The service is great and the long line moves quickly; in our case, the line was to the door and we had our food in less than 10 minutes. Ordering a dinner is the way to go here-- the sides are absolutely delicious and totally worth it. BBQ can be expensive, but for $13 this meal is a great deal. I opted for pork ribs with green beans and Mac and cheese. The ribs were so smoky and fell right off the bone. The green beans were heavily spiced and charred; so delicious. The Mac and cheese was creamy and amazing. Do not skip the pickles on the condiment bar; they are spicy and amazing! I love the indoor and outdoor seating options and am so glad that we stumbled across this place on Yelp-- absolutely amazing.
