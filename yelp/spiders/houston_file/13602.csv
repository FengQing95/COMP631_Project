JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now for the ramen. My fam and I have some dietary restrictions so we love that they have a two non-meat based broths - a vegetarian broth and a vegan broth! Their creamy vegan broth is where it's at. You can add Â sides to add to your ramen (garlic is free). We got garlic, bok choy, bamboo shoots, and egg (poached for me and bro, season boiled for my sis). The ramen was so good!! Their noodles are deliciously dense and the broth was on point. I added sriracha but didn't need much else. The only thing I could've done without were the bamboo shoots, I usually love them but wasn't feeling them here.
