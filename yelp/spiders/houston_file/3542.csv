JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would pay you if you show me better ramen place in Houston! There are so many ramen options on the menu, so I can't even decide what to choose every time I get there. It's a shame that at first I was a bit hesitant about a spot like that, but it impressed me. If you decide to visit Jinya Ramen Bar, you really must try extra pork! The other winners are the potstickers, the fried chicken, the Jinya bun and the shrimp balls!
