Kata Robata////During our first trip we experienced some slow service, but not so the second time around, even though it was a packed house on a Friday night. Great parking, and reservations aren't hard to come by. My chief complaint: noise level. When the dining room is even moderately busy, you'll find yourself yelling in order to have the wait staff and your dining companions hear you.
