Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is over priced and over rated. The selection on actual meals and not dessert was slim. I couldnt bite into the sandwich I ordered because the bread was too tough. I had to tear the bread apart and eat it in pieces. The water was self serve and no ice. So we drank room temp water. Be prepared to eat somewhere else afterwards because you wont be satisfied.
