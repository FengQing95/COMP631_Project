Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Once we got inside all the servers were really friendly, had smiles, and were personable. The menu is awesome (though I was disappointed that they didn't have any waffles) and really varied. The drink menu is one of the most interesting I've seen with sweet and savory drinks, mimosas (a beer-mosa!), micheladas, bloody marys, and spiked dessert drinks.
