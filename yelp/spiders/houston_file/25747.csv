The Pit Room////This place is worth checking out. It is a little smaller than expected, but the food is better than expected. It might be a little hard to find a table during peak lunch hours, but it is worth it. The brisket and sausage were excellent. I've also tried the ribs, which are fine, but not as good as the brisket and sausage.
