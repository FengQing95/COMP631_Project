JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////On average, we prepare upwards of 1,500 eggs per day, with each egg hand-peeled by our kitchen staff, so unfortunately by the law of probability, some eggs may not get peeled completely. However, this is the type of mistake that can't go unnoticed, as you rightfully mention, so again, I apologize for our misstep.
