JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Gabrielle - Thank you for your review and feedback. I'm sorry you did not enjoy your to-go order. Ideally, ramen is served for dine-in only; in fact, in Japan there are many ramen restaurants that do not consider takeout an option. However, as an American company, we try to meet the demands of all of our guests in this regard.
