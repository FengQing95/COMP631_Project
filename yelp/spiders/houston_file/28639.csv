The Pit Room////The line was pleasantly short for a Sunday afternoon. The typeface menu board (no specials scrawled by hand in chalk here!) offers meat platters, tacos and specials. I noticed the venison sausage just before I looked over and saw a guy behind the counter handle massive hunks of ribs coated with a thick layer of rub. Next to the cash register were open ice buckets full of local craft beer and Topo Chico.
