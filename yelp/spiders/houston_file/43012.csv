Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////There's a lot wrong with this in my opinion. I understand baked goods selling out (and there were pastries left), but how do you sell out of an entire kitchen menu hours before the kitchen closes? And further not inform people before they wait 10 minutes to get to the front of the line? I had a coffee, which was fine, but given the number of amazing coffee shops in this town and the ridiculous experience i had to just get that cup of coffee, I can say with confidence that no foodplace is worth this trouble.
