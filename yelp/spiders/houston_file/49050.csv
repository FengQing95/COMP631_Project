Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I went to Snooze a couple of times now. There is always a long wait of at least 40 minutes and they do not take reservation. I'm normally not a brunch person but I do like their food. So far I tried the salmon eggs benedict, pancakes flight (sweet potato, pineapple upside down, chocolate) - all were good. Most recently I ordered take out because it takes only 15 minutes. I got the OMG french toast. I think this is least favorite so far and won't be ordering it again.
