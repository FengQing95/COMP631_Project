Kata Robata////The atmosphere here feels business-casual but just don't come directly after the gym and you'll be fine. It's medium-lit here, not as dim as a steakhouse, just a little brighter than that.Oftentimes you will see a lot of business dinners here so it isn't always an intimate setting. The staff here are all extremely kind, they were very helpful in identifying each piece of fish and ensuring they describe the plates as they were served.
