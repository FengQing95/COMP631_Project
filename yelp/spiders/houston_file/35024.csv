Local Foods////Came to check this place out for lunch today and we loved it! It's got a great vibe that is perfect for groups or couples. It's a casual environment, you order food at the counter, they give you a number, and the food is brought out to you. They have tons of food options, many of which seem lean, clean, and green. Great spot for all food preferences including vegan and vegetarian. The summer harvest salad was amazing!! The flavors and texture work so well together, I'll definitely be back for it. We also got the portobello melt sandwich, which came with two sides, all of which were delicious. We topped it off with the chocolate chip pecan cookie which was awesome. The quantity was great for the price, we came in hungry and still had some leftovers we took home. All in all, great vibe, great food, excellent service!
