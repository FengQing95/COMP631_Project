Baby Barnaby's////Breakfast does not get any better in my book.  I eat the healthy burrito and even that is good.  But, I have no willpower, so I always eat half of my husbands home fries which are ludelish (new word, I just made it up merge ludicrous and delicious). (side note: I wonder why my spell check did not notify me that ludelish was misspelled the first time I wrote it, but did notify me the second time???)   Let's just say they are so good there wasn't a word in the english language to describe those homefries until I so courteously  made one up. Yeah for me.  Yeah for homefries with reduced guilt because you just ate an eggwhite omelet on whole wheat tortilla for breakfast.  Yeah for Baby Barnaby's.  HIP HIP...
