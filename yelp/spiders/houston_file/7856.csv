JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In the six years we have been in operation, I have never heard of anything remotely similar to your claims, and as one of the two male managers who work at JINYA-Midtown, I can say with impunity that neither of us would EVER say these words to a customer. Thank you in advance for your follow-up. Here is my phone number, as well: (917-748-8730). I await your response.
