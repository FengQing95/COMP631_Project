JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This was my first visit to JINYA Ramen Bar. Why? To begin with this type of food is not usually my first, second or third choice when I plan to eat out however I do enjoy eating it occasionally. Â I visited for lunch last weekend and am glad I did. I ordered the Jinya chicken ramen, pork gyoza and salad and finally the crispy shrimp balls. With iced green tea to drink my bill with tax but before tip was about $24. It was a lot of food but gave me the opportunity to do some serious sampling.
