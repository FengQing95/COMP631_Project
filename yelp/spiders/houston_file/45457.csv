Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The Lavender Latte has an exquisite taste, with a hint of a floral and earthy flavor. I don't think I'm making a really good description of just how good it was, but I imagined drinking it in a field of sunflowers on a warm and sunny day, so I would recommend trying it just to see if I'm crazy or not in imagining my small scenario after my taste of the drink.Â
