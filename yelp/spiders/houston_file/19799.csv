Uchi////Setting: In the hot and humid Houston weather, it is very difficult to wait outside for 45 minutes..but we did with the help of mist fans and drink service in the small outdoor area.  But be prepared for cigarette smoke (not my thing).  The inside is clean, modern but with wood furnishings.  The ceilings are high (even with the Houston Texans offensive line towering over everyone) and lighting is smart...not to dim, not too bright.
