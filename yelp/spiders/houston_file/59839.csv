Baby Barnaby's////It's tiny and cozy inside with posters from my old stomping grounds, San Fran, on the walls. Makes a girl feel right at home! After settling into a booth with my fiance and finally warming up enough to unzip our winter jackets, we were warmly greeted with coffee and a smile. A short time later, out came the green eggs and huevos rancheros. My green eggs were somewhat healthy with spinach and artichoke hearts, although I could have done with about half the cheese. Next time I'll know. The fiance seemed happy with his food and polished the whole thing off before eating the other half of my eggs. And there were plenty of eggs left because after taking one bite of potato, I see why this place draws a crowd. Crispy on the outside, soft and mushy on the inside, it was breakfast potato heaven. I ate every last potato on my plate. yum!
