Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The wait is long and there is not enough space to wait. I am not sure if they accept reservations but that may be your best bet. Other than that, it's pretty crowded on the inside. Almost like being in a packed waffle house. I wasn't really able to fully relax. Other than that, the food is great and the servers were attentive and knowledgeable of the menu, even offering samples of sauces before we ordered. I guess the only advice I can give is regarding the layout of the place which isn't easy to fix. So if you aren't a fan of busy/crowded areas and maybe are more of an anxious person this may not be the brunch spot for you. That being said, because it was so busy I didn't get to see the entire establish maybe there are more spacious areas you can request.
