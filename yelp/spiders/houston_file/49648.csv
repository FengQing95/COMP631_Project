Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is, hands down, one of the best brunch places I've tried in Houston!! The service and food is amazing and you get so much variety!! The only downsides are very limited parking (there is street parking) and VERY long wait times (expect 1 hr+ if you go after 9/10am with a party bigger than two on weekends) Â
