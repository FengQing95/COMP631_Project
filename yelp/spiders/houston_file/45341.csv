Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The quality of the baked goods is fantastic.  I'm an amateur baker so I appreciate the hard work it takes to get things right in the kitchen.  30 seconds of baking time, or kneading time, can turn a good pastry into a dry, tough, chewy one, so the fact that they are consistently able to turn out high quality goods speaks to how well they know their craft.
