Uchi////I have to say that this was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  Being our first time there we decided to go with the 6 course omakase and am glad we did.  They did a fantastic job of building the flavors up and each course built upon the previous one.  After the 5th course we ordered the wagyu special just to try it and it was well worth it.  Looking back, we should have done the 10 course omakase to make sure we were beyond stuffed.
