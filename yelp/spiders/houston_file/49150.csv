Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////-Pancake trio: I always end up ordering this as a "side" and never as its own entree because pancakes are treated like dessert and my stomach knows to save some room for that! The molten chocolate pancakes are a little on the heavy side and dry, not moist as you think it would be except the small amount of chocolate fondue that's inside the pancake. I love their sweet potato pancakes.
