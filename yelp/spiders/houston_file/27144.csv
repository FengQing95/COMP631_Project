The Pit Room////When I first got into the line the staff seemed kinda out of it and they didn't have a warm feeling when greeted. It took the guy a solid 4 minutes for him to remember what they had left to serve me. He kept pointing to the metal display tray but was telling me about options he didn't have anymore, he basically should of told me its sausage and brisket only at this point cause that was the only thing they had when I came in. The guy getting the sides seemed annoyed to portion out sides. The guy who rang me up was just awkward, he kept moving around. Printing out the check, walking to opposite corner to hand it to me, then walking back to the spot he was originally at and then asking me to put the check down in a different spot? The guy who took me and my buddies tray when we finished was very nice and asked us about our food.
