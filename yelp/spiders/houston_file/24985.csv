Uchi////All three items were 5/5 for us. Each dish had varying textures and complimentary flavors. You read the description on the menu and go "hmmm, I wonder how that would taste together". Once you take that first bite, it completely takes you by surprise! The plating is beautiful and you can see so much care that goes into each dish.
