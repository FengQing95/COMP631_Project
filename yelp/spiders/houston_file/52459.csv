Kata Robata////If you like tempura/fancy/modern rolls, this is your spot. It has taken me two years to find a sushi place in Houston I love. This place is super clean (a lot of other Houston Sushi places gross me out) and the flavors and use of fish and sauces is so damn delicious. It is a bit pricey, but I would rather pay for great quality, great tasting sushi than get a "deal" on a roll down the street.
