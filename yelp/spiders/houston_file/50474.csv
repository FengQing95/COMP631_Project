Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I wanted to try this place because of all the raving reviews. My family and I came here for Sunday brunch, wait time was almost 40 minutes. I had the shrimp and grits which was ok, I've had better. My sister ordered the French toast was fine however the caramel was a little bitter. I don't understand the hype about this place, definitely not worth the wait.
