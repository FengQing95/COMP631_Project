Kata Robata////While the food overall is above average, the service is not so much. We had to ask for utensils and refills of drinks and it was very hard to catch our server. Did I mention the restaurant was NOT packed? There were many empty tables at the time. So I'm not sure how their service would be if it was busy. For a lunch that we paid for over $100, the service was disappointing.
