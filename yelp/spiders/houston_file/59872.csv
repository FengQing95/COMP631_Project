Baby Barnaby's////Even though coming here was a big inconvenience and caused us to rearrange some plans that morn, my friends gave it plenty of compliments and found it to be worth it.  My BFF even deemed it better than one of her fav bfast joints of all time.  This is a great place to take visitors for a healthier AND tastier alternative to chain bfast places!
