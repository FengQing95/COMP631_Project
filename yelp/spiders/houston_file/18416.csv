Uchi////I gave it three stars because I wasn't wow'ed by the food. Yes it was eye-pleasing, but if I wanted food that tickled my tongue and made me scream with pleasure, I would go elsewhere...however, the place is absolutely gorgeous. Waitstaff was truly professional and knowledgeable as expected. Would love to come back to this place once the hype dies down and their true potential is reached. I can imagine more dishes like the pork belly would make it on the menu...or maybe new fish that I've never even heard of..maybe even a guest chef appearance from Iron Chef, Morimoto ;-)
