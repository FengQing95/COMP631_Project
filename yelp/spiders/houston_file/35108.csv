Local Foods////Refund me my money !!!! Watery warm potato salad left outside and cucumber salad was even worse, you can tell it has been out for hours in the heat. Inside temperature felt like 80F. I have been a loyal customer for the last 5 years and never experienced quality issue. I have also taken many of my clients to lunch there and introduced them to Local Foods since they have never had lunch there before. I have been to every location in Downtown, San Felipe, Heights, Kirby and Rice Village. Every location has a glass fridge ( beside Rice Village ) where the sides are stored and once ordered taken out to be served. My stomach feels weird as well now. I am so disappointed by Rice Village location, and I don't think they have safe practices because they see so many people now they just throw everything in the basket. I wish I would have taken a picture but I was so angry about the quality and needed to go to another meeting that I didn't have time and just threw everything in the trash outside! I am never going back to the Rice Village location and will not recommend it to my clients! With these practices y'all are going to poison someone! I want my money back!!!
