Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Kugelhopf - I actually liked this the most out of the three pastries. If you like panettone and stollen, I'm pretty sure you'll like kugelhopf. This little pastry is crusted with sugar and has hints of citrus and vanilla. It was moist but not overly so like a cupcake. I also like that it wasn't overloaded with raisins and it's a nice accompaniment to a coffee break or "light" breakfast. I really liked the contrasting textures of the sugar-coated crust and spongy crumb inside.
