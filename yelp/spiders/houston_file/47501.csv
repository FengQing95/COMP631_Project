Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This place is awesome!!!! Delicious food options with reasonable prices. Very generous portions and a perfectly clean environment. Our server Karen couldn't have been more perfect. Fast, efficient, friendly and very knowledgeable. Talk about service with a smile!!!  She made our first experience at Snooze very enjoyable. I'd love to say we'd be back, but sadly we are out of towners. Hey Snooze, build one of these in either New Braunfels or Schertz, Texas!!!!  We would be regulars for sure!!!!!
