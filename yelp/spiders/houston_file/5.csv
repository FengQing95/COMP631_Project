Baby Barnaby's////Great place for breakfast! Fresh squeezed orange juice with refill; I had the omelet with spinach, artichokes and cheese and it was delicious! Wide variety from pancakes to Tex-Mex choices. Casual dining (jeans) with outdoor patio. Get there early because it does get crowed. Highly recommended.
