Kata Robata////Considering the number of very good sushi restaurants in Houston and in the same neighborhood, I found Kata to be a big disappointment. It is overpriced for, frankly, very average food. Service was uneven: the dishes we ordered first came out after the dishes we ordered later; we couldn't get our waiter to come by for the longest stretches of time; but as soon as they figured out we were not ordering any more, they were very eager to get us to pay so they could flip the table. All in all, not a very pleasant dining experience.
