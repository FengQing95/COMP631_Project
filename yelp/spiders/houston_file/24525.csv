Uchi////Update 2/1 -- the restaurant reached out after my review to discuss and validate our experience.  That is a nice step to see, as not all places are interested in improvement and customer satisfaction to this degree.   They invited us back in to retry and I'm almost certain that will happen at some point as my wife loves high end sushi.
