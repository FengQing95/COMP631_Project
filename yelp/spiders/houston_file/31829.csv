Local Foods////Love this place. The crunchy chicken sandwich is my favorite. That crunchy texture. That freaking sauce, whatever it is. Â The pretzel bun is so good but if you're looking for a more low-cal option, they will make any of the sandwiches into a salad for you. Their soups change consistently, but I always seem to order a soup as my side. Ahhh, can't say enough good things about this place. Pretty vibey and I'd say it portrays a more hipster crowd. So so good.
