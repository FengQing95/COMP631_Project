Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The almond croissant is near crack level good. And I'm not even a big pastries person. I've dine-ined once, first time, for brunch on a saturday ~10am (but since then I've gone back multiple occasions just to pick up an almond croissant) Saturday brunch was packed.I've waited ~30 mins before just to pick up a croissant. They do have a medium sized parking lot but most of the time, if you go during busy hr, you'll have to park on the street. Â It's not hard to find a table once you've ordered but the ordering process is where the line is. For brunch, I was craving something savory and heavy (must've been a post alcohol effect), their menu at the time however didn't have the traditional 'brunch' food--they had some cold soups, salad but nothing heavy like pancakes and bacon. I just checked their website recently and it looks like they've updated the brunch menu to be more 'brunchy' now--so I'm definitely willing try it again. I ordered a different croissant at the time, some fruit jelly filled one? and a cappuccino. That croissant was okay--the cappuccino was also okay--I'm not a big coffee drinker so I'm not exactly sure what 'good' coffee is--but their cappuccino was more milk than coffee (comparing this to starbucks). It has a very pretty presentation though! It's a nice place to catch up--a bit loud/crowded on a weekend but during any weekday--def a nice place to hang out.
