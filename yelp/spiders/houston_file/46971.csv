Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you can get over the pretentious hipsters who are this restaurant in the middle of the day because they don't have jobs, the food is actually great, which is why I'm giving this one four stars. Our service was good too, until the end when my coworker got up from the table and another waitress ran into her and demanded she acknowledge her presence. My coworker just brushed it off as the typical, entitled hipster attitude or her having a rough day - the food is good enough for us to come back and try to have a better experience.
