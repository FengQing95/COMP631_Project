JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have eaten at several Ramen spots in Houston and I would say this is by far my favorite. I know...I know....this is a chain Ramen Bar from California and the noodles aren't made on site. I would love for anyone to blind taste and try to tell me that it doesn't taste as fresh as it gets.  I have dined here several times, and ordered take out twice. (Jinya is about 40 minutes from my house so a bit of a drive.) Every time we have dined in we have always enjoyed good service. There are busy times, but have patience, its worth it. We usually always start off with the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura. They are amazing!! For main course I always order the Tonkotsu Black. Thats made with pork broth(which is so amazing it tastes like its cooked for days.) pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg*, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce served with thin noodles, but I always pay a little more to have some thick noodles in it as well. Ordering the extra broth is always recommended in my opinion. Only bad experience I've ever had is when I ordered a $60 togo order and I didn't check to make sure it was all there. Got back home and I was missing my extra pork, and both extra broths and noodles on the two orders of  Ramen. Next time Ill just make sure to check cause had I, i could have saved myself from disappointment. Like I said I think this is the best spot for Ramen in Houston and I highly recommend it.
