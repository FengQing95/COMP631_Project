Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is a great place that has fresh-baked bread and pastries all day they have an amazing selection and they are known for their cookies which are to die for. It's super hipster and very modern and I love coming here although every time I come to cookie they're sold out so I'm really glad that I was finally able to get my hands on some. The pastries all look delicious and the cakes are super amazing as well I asked them to warm up my cookies and it took them 12 minutes so that's a little frustrating but besides that everything else was really great including the cookie which was delicious and super large
