JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Being from Chicago, the craze has been in full swing for a couple years now.  When I moved to Houston 6 months ago, I was looking forward to trying the ramen here, but I've been disappointed until coming to Jinya! (nina ramen - limited selection, tiger den - overhyped, I do like kata robata but it gets pretty packed)  I had heard good things about the Clear Lake location, but it was too far.  The midtown location is perfect and delicious!  The parking is a little dicey (and I'm still a bit confused on that end).
