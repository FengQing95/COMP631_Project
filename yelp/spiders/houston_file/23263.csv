Uchi////The last thing that annoyed me was when my husband made the reservation for our birthdays (my 35 and his 36), he thought they would give us a complimentary dessert to celebrate, but we ended up buying our own (fried milk). Not a big deal, but considering other upscale restaurants do it, it was another tick against Uchi.
