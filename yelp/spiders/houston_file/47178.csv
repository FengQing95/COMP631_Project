Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Been here for 35 mins. Ordered the chiliquiles Benedict. Only to have it come out cold. Only thing hot on the plate were the hashbrowns. Â Shouldn't be that long to cook eggs. Might not have been cold had our server Aaron not been sitting down at the table behind us for 12 mins, nor would our drinks been empty! Not to mention, the crab clawing of glasses. I put my lips on the rim on the cup, I don't need your dirty fingers on there please! Won't be back! Much better in Denver!
