JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am so glad I was introduced to this place by a friend! Not only is it yummy but I like to come here when I'm not feeling so good. Their ramen immediately makes me feel better. I brought my friend from out of town yesterday and she fell in love with this place. The only con is there are no longer free noodle refills but I can understand why there is a charge.
