Kata Robata////1) Appetizers (The items are served tapas-style): Â We started with a seafood salad, which had pieces of salmon and scallop sashimi on top of japanese seaweed salad and a bed of mixed greens. It was so-so: the flavors didn't mesh that well, and I felt like each ingredient would taste better separate from the salad. Also had a lobster salad, which was GREAT. Chilled, cooked lobster meat on top of a bed of greens, with ?pine nuts and cherry tomatos. The flavors in this salad blended wonderfully, and it was a light and delicious way to start the meal.
