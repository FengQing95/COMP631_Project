Kata Robata////Wanted to go somewhere for fresh wasabi. This was the place. But the fresh wasabi ended up being just a part of the excellent evening. These guys have fresh fish flown in daily from Japan. The chef served me truly the best, perfect temp and most wonderful tasting sushi I've ever ate. My wife and I arrived a little before our seats were ready(the place was packed) so we enjoyed some top of the line drinks at the bar. All the staff were as awesome as the environment. My wife, who is not super into sushi even ordered seconds. I had to force myself to stop eating. Ha! But I did get to wash it all down with a couple of Japanese micro brews I've never had offered at any other sushi restaurant. This place was hands down the best sushi I've ever eating in Houston. Â It was our first time there but I can promise you it will most definitely not be the last. Hope this helps.
