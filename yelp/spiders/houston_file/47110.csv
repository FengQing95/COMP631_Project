Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I really truly love this place. The food never fails and the team is always pleasant. I've never had to wait more than 20ish minutes but I only go for lunch during the weekday, so not too bad! So why is it only 4 stars? Almost every single time I've gone (5+!!) it takes forever for the server to get our drink orders and then takes just as long to give our food orders. I hope they get that part figured out, because honestly if I knew I could get consistently quick service then I would go more often.
