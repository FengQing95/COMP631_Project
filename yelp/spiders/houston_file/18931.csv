Uchi////- Foie Nigiri - the way the foie gras was seared to perfection sealed its natural, rich flavor to be broken only by its devourer. Â Eaten upside down is the best way to enjoy this meal for once the flavor explosion commences, your tongue immediately tastes its sweet and salty flavor and continues to enjoy its flavor as the rice soaks it up, prolonging the heavenly experience.
