Uchi////I was really expecting more from this place.  Not really the fault of the restaurant but the hype that surrounds it.  I was expecting either better sushi or something.. different? I just expected something either more amazing or innovative. The food was pretty pricey for what you get in my opinion.  I'd rather spend the same money on more traditional sushi.
