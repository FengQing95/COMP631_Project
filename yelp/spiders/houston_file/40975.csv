Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Not only do I love the food, but the establishment as a whole. The people from the bartender to the manager on staff (dark hair 5'5" maybe Hispanic) we came in to try something new. It was a great choice! The Okra which I would never normally order was spectacular to my tastebuds. It was sweet from the sauce and savory with bits of sausage. It was everything I wanted for my palate. I could have went home satisfied at that point. I continued on with the Brocollini and crispy onions and a fried egg on top. It was great but a little under cooked. (That didn't stop my from demolishing it) now for the show stopping spicy chicken sandwich. It was prob one of those dishes you save half for later. Great sized portions all around! Yet again it was just so good I couldn't stop feeding my soul... Thank you Bosscat! I can't wait to come back!
