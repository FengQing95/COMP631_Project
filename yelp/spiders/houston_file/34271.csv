Local Foods////If you have not been here hop in your car and get there! They have so many great options its hard to choose! My recommendation-- Taco Salad (I sub for the veggie patty)! Potato salad is yum! And the vegan carrot cake is BOMB! SO good!! Great atmosphere and awesome employees. Had some trouble one time with the online ordering and they were super nice about it! Love it here and being a regular to all the locations!
