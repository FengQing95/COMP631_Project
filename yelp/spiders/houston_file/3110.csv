JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I usually stop at ramen shops while in Austin because there hasn't been much to offer in the way of it here in Houston. My boyfriend and I finally stopped here last month and all I can say is WOW. I've been here 4 or 5 times since. Last time we went it was packed. Despite being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we were seated in less than 5. I always order the spicy chicken ramen. It is delicious! Their crispy shrimp appetizer is delicious. Cocktails are good, too. I love this place. It doesn't hurt to stop at the treat place around the corner after, either. :)
