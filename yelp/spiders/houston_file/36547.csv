Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The drinks were pretty average. Moscow mule tasted watered down and I've had better. Their BC lemonade was refreshing, but when I ordered another, it was so over inundated with jalape√±o it was difficult to get through. My husband was content with the coffee/whiskey libation, but said he couldn't taste any coffee, just whiskey.
