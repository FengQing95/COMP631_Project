Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////"A Well-Oiled Machine - Coffee & Food Great Too" - I wanted to go here for so long but each time the line would be around the building and down the sidewalk. Finally on an early Sunday morning in July, I rode my bike here and had fruit, small pastry, and a couple cups of coffee. What I did not expect was to see such a tiny place turnout so much business seemingly non-stop. I met the manager and he share their training model and service plan (within limits of course) and I told him that I would certainly write a review. So, here it is. I had a great breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed watching every single person be served with a smile. They made me feel like I was family. This is not the norm for the Montrose area. There are restaurants with employees who have made me feel like they did not want my money because I was Black. Thank you Common-Bond for living up to your name. I will certainly return and encourage my friends to patronize this place as well.
