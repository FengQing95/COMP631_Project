The Pit Room////Must try BBQ! We came here and got the 3 meat plate. We chose brisket, chicken and sausage. The brisket was the winner. Very tender and the smoke rings were on point. Also got a beef rib and it was to die for. So tender and perfect. The sides we chose were mac and cheese and potato salad. I must say the mac and cheese stole the show! So creamy and so decadent. It's a must try. They have plenty of beer on tap and can. Definitely coming back for round 2!
