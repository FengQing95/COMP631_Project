The Pit Room////Over from Louisiana where it is hard to find good BBQ. Searched on line and on yelp for a highly rated joint near my son's apartment and landed on the The Pit Room. Ate there on a Friday afternoon around 4:30 and the dining room was pretty much full but there was no line and the food was fresh.
