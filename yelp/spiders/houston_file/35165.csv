Local Foods////The salad was huge and so freaking delicious I can't even stand it. Citrus goat cheese and Brussels  with pomegranate seeds?! Get outta here!! I hope one of these comes to Austin. The smaller side salads were both very good. All of this healthy amazingness for under $17!  I'm gonna try to go back before I leave Houston. UPDATE- I went back. The black bean quinoa burger is so good! The chips were kinda greasy but good taste and their brownie is so moist and delicious!! I went back on day 3 for the harvest salad... I might go back tonight for another burger ‍
