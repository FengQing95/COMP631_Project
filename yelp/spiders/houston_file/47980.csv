Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I got the hash brown dish with 2 toppings, avocado and spinach. It was average tbh. I regretted not ordering their pancakes instead. Â I want to go back so it can redeem itself. Side note: we waited about 1 hr to be seated outside and food took a while too but the waitress was really nice. Both of the hostess' there were a little unorganized and not as nice though. I'll be back one day in the future when I'm not in a hurry to give it another chance.
