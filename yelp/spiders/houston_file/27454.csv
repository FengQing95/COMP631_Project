The Pit Room////Between hubbs, his parents and I, we ordered a pound of brisket, a pound of pork ribs, a cheese and jalape√±o sausage, and a pint of potato salad, coleslaw, and beans. The first piece of brisket was huge, and it was moist, delicious and juicy. Unfortunately the pleasant experience stopped at that piece. Underneath, hidden, were tiny strips of end pieces, mostly inedible black bark. Any meat was completely dried out and inedible. Then the ribs were really thin and very chewy and dry, like beef jerky; very disappointing. The sausage was okay, but pretty small for $4.
