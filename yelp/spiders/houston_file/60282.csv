Baby Barnaby's////The BEST brunch spot in Houston. Great area and the place has a homey feel to it. Scott is very welcoming and a great waiter. What can I say....where shall I start....Coffee best cup in town, my fav is the locks and bagels very yummy. Have had several entrees and all are a delight. Cudo's especially to the spicy potatoes and fresh OJ. Definitely a go to place when I'm in town. Â
