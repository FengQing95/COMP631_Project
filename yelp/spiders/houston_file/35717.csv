Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////First off awesome atmosphere. The service was fast and attentive. Our waiter Terry was awesome. The back waiters were quick to refill waters and take dirty/empty plates. Great selection of beer and the simple burger was off the chain!! Been here twice now. Both times have been awesome. Definitely 5 stars from me.
