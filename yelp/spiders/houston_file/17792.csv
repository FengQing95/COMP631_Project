Uchi////BRUSSSSSSSEEEELLLLL SPPPPRRROUTTS!   OMG...we had atleast 10 things on the menu.  I love the atmo, the music, the private sushi chef, the service, the just overall in your face about it.  It is such an intimate place you really only want to go with one other person.  The line is out the door but they treat you like the only people in there.  Palate cleansers and hot towels to ordering one of everything on the menu and sweet unfiltered cold sake to run atop for memories fit for kings and queens.  Quite an experience every time.  I would put all my photos on here...but everyone else has and we all know the cookbook is available.  But the best part is when the man you hold holds all the secrets and connections to a dining experience as described "when you are an eagle you can look down on everyone and everything below you"  LOL  RUDE but true.  UCHI is this place.  You cannot hold a candle to the creation abound with flare and attitude.  Graffiti my plate because you have entered beauty into my life.  A love for food translates to expansion and growth only people I want to be reflective of that can experience with silence because you have fallen over yourself with unexpected enthusiasm you did not know could be provided on a white plate.   Uchiceviche...Brussell Sprouts...Ham and Egg...just keep going down the menu...do not ask questions.  Live with zero expectations and you reach food enlightenment!
