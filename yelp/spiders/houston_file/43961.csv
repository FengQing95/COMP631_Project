Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Almond Croissant is an airy confection with a crisp shell that crackled when my lips touched, before my teeth ever did any damage.  I wasn't too excited until I reached the almond paste, which took several bites.  Mmm, good, super almond-y, but I'd try the chocolate croissant instead.  Not a super fan girl of the croissant only because I fall for more doughy, dense textures!
