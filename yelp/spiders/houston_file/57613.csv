Kata Robata////We visited over the Christmas break and wanted hit up some of our favorite restaurants - Kata is always the one at the top of our list. Normally we dine in because the food tastes so much better fresh, but we ordered to-go this time around because of all that was going on. The curbside pickup was great & well-organized. We parked in the curbside parking spot, someone came out quickly to acknowledge us & confirm our order, and then the food came out with no problems after a short wait.
