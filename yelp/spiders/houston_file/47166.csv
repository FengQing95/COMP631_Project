Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I was skeptical at first because of the 45min wait BUT after looking at the menu THAT all changed!!!!! Small and personable experience. I feel that anyone who wants an EXCITING BRUNCH experience this is the PLACE, good food, and servers with wonderfully huge personalities should come here. My server was "The Tiny Dancer" she was wonderful. I parked in front of the place, which was small and cozy without any hassle. Now for the food I had the "Pancake and French Toast flight" with Sweet Potato and Cinnamon Roll pancakes with stuffed French Toast. This was an amazing menu and the food WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! So when your ever in Houston make sure you stop at "Snooze" an AM Eatery!!!!
