JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I came to this restaurant several months ago during a trip to Houston and I still think about the amazing food! I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen which was really good. It was definitely a sniffles-causing level of spicy but I didn't think it was overpowering. I still wish I could get my hands on that soup again to this day.
