Uchi////The ugly: we get the bill, and we were charged for the soy paper on the fourth roll.  This really upset us because the server suggested it because the other three rolls were inedible, and never told us she would charge us for it!  When she came to get the bill, we told her that we should not have been charged for the soy paper.  She actually seemed confused, and asked us if we wanted her to take the three rolls off the bill or just the soy paper charge.  She ended up taking off only the soy paper charge, and we paid for all of the chewy, yucky rolls.  Even after the gift card, I felt the meal was not even worth what I paid for with the remaining bill balance.  While the service was okay (we got refills, our table was cleared a lot), we left disappointed with the quality and the fact that we were, in essence, penalized for not liking poor quality maki and seaweed.  The server seemed surprised that we wanted to remove the charge for soy paper that we did not know about and that she suggested.
