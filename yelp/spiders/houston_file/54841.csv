Kata Robata////I just barley started working in the area... So it is and going take me some time to explore the area. Â It was my lunch time and very unsure where to go. I haven't had sushi /Japanese food in a VERY long time and had a craving for a bento box and California rolls. So I stopped in this restaurant. I usually go to yelp reviews for EVERYTHING epically when wanting to try something new.
