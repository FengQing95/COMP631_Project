JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I am not a ramen noodles expert but I was expecting the ramen to be the soft freshly made ramen. (It doesn't mean the hard uncooked ramen can't be made fresh I just thought it'll be from fresh to fridge to pot / irrelevant, just sayin'). Fresh or not, it is uncooked and served it twice the same way.... I never feel the hardness of the ramen before. I understand how fast it cooked and I understand the principle that it'll cook simultaneously so maybe I shouldn't eat it sooner as it was serve. At least in the meat I can see the difference and I can wait but I never waited for the noodles to cook after it was serve.
