Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////If you like a LOUD bar trendy atmosphere, then this place is for you. The boyfriend and I decided to try this place out as it was already late and most restaurants would be near closing time. Parking can be difficult to find, but we got lucky and got a space in front. There is outdoor seating and it had a very kind of modern industrial look on the inside. As for the food, considering that it's bar food, it's pretty good. However, I'd like to emphasize that point - (at least at night) this is a bar that serves food, it is NOT a restaurant with a bar. For the price you pay, the food definitely isn't worth it and if you're there to talk at all with the people you came with, good luck. It's extremely loud and the chairs are uncomfortable - for the ladies out there, the chairs aren't all great for hanging your purse.
