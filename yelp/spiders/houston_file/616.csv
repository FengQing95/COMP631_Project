JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is part of a chain restaurant group. This location is loud and long and dark inside the main room with staff and patrons constantly walking past. Not a relaxing atmosphere. None of the mostly pork ramen selections appealed to me and since they didn't have any miso, I chose the curry. It came out lukewarm temperature and the consistency of baby food. Not returning.
