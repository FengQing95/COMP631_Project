JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was in Japan several years ago and have been looking for a ramen place I like, and this is the most similar to what I had abroad, with rich broth, toppings galore and that classic egg in the bowl. You can BYO ramen, which is way too much work for me, so I got the Tonkotsu spicy (not at all spicy) and my husband got the Tonkatsu black. Both of us preferred the spicy, which somehow just tasted richer and fuller and had those satisfying thick noodles. You have the option to refill your noodles at the end for $2, which I liked, and the pork itself was delicious.
