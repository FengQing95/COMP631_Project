JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We went there last night with my family and the ambience was nice/almost hipster-like and the food-DELICIOUS. Having gone to so many ramen places in California and NYC I was craving a decent place in Houston and Jinya Ramen Bar did not let me down. We had the pork buns which were semi-sweet and tender (also large for ~$4) and tried all the ramen types lol including the spicy chicken which was surprisingly very savory. Would definitely recommend it for anyone having a late night craving for some good ramen!
