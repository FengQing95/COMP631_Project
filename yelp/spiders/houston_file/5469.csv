JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Taylor - Thank you very much for the 5-star review. I am so glad you enjoyed our ramen, and we agree with your fair warning on our off-menu spicy settings for our broths. Also, I appreciate your kind words regarding our takeout; we try our best to not make mistakes, but it's tough on Sunday evenings, when we get bombarded with orders.
