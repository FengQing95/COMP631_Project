Uchi////Uchi is another upscale sushi restaurant. It is usually pretty busy as soon as it opens at 5 pm. The great thing about Uchi is that you can still enjoy it and not break bank! They have social hour from 5-6:30 pm daily, throughout the whole restaurant and their menu is not bad at all! Sake during this time is $3 for a bottle that is about 9 little sake shots, seriously such a steal! Dishes on the social hour menu ranges from $5-$8 compared to their normal prices which ranges from $15-$20 a plate. I love sitting at the bar because I get to see the chefs work their magic and plus there's great lighting. You have to get there early though because seats usually fill out by 5:30. I'd call ahead of time and ask about the wait or make a reservation.
