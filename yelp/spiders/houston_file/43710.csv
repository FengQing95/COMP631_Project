Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The vibes, staff, and food are all on point. You can't go wrong with any of the baked goods on display, but I would recommend one of the chocolate chip cookies for sure. The service is great and everyone who works there is very friendly. Overall a great place for brunch or even if you're just craving something sweet
