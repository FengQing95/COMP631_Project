Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////But regardless of the poor parking situation, this place sets the standard for all brunch places!! The food is always delicious, drinks are fresh and boozy when required to be, and the service is always friendly in a cool atmosphere. I normally come here on Sundays, and there is sometimes a local farmers market pop up next door. It's the perfect place to walk, look around, and kill some time while you wait for a table. Snooze is also perfect in that they have offer free coffee while you wait.
