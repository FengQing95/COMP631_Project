JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We started with 8-count gyoza and tempura Brussels sprouts. I didn't taste any truffle oil, but then again I was also dipping the sprouts in gyoza sauce because they didn't come with any dipping sauce otherwise. The gyoza is pretty good. Thin skin, fried on one side, yum.
