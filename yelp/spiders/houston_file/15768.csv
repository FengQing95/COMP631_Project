JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ive had JINYA bookmarked for months as a "Must Try" and i finally decided to check them out. My first impression walking in was that it seemed much smaller than i thought and it had a weird sewer smell. Still, We decided to sit at the bar and was greeting right away by our bartender.
