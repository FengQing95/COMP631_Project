Kata Robata////My boyfriend took me to Kata Robata for my birthday and I had a great time. Jenny was our waitress and she did an amazing job. The restaurant was very busy, but she wasn't flustered or impatient. She took the time to explain drinks, appetizers, and entrees to us, since this was our first time there. She was one of the best waitresses/waiters I've ever had.
