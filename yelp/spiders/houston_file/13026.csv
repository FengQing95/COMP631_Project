JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lisa - Thank you very much for your review. We greatly appreciate your patronage and your kind words. We are very pleased to know April provided you with good service. However, as we are always looking to improve our station, can you explain in detail how you have not received good service in the past? Any and all information is helpful to us in this regard. We look forward to hearing from you and hope you'll come through again soon.
