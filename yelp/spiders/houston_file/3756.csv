JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////- main entree was the Jinya No #1: Jinya Tonkotsu Black. Broth was amazing, pork chashu was a little thick but cooked well. I ordered a side of fresh garlic (MUST), bamboo and mushrooms. my advice is don't get any of the sides becuase it comes straight from a jar/can and has 0 flavor relating back to your bowl of ramen. Better off just eating whatever comes with your bowl. also - stick with thin noodles. the thick noodle option will unnecessarily fill you up.
