Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've had most of the risen dough from Montrose's new darling and have not been disappointed. Although I had to consult google for the pronunciation of Kouign Amann and Kugelhopf, it was no less of a revelation on my tongue. My favorite, the Kouign Amann is best described as a caramelized and thicker croissant. The Kugelhopf is the David Hasselhoff of brioches, with the sweet glitz and glamour. The croissants are made for giants, crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. The delicious cookies are thick and soft. My favorite breakfast offering is the biscuits slathered in BACON gravy. Yup I capitalized BACON, because BACON deserves it. The coffee drinks will leave you wide-eyed and satisfied as well.
