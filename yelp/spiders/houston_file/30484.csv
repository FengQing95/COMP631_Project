The Pit Room////Today is my 32nd birthday, so whatever the birthday boy wants the birthday boy gets. So I decided to come here because I was craving for some ribs baddddddddd. We came here during the lunch rush but surprisingly it wasn't too busy plus it's a Tuesday so I didn't expect for it to be fully packed. I ordered the two meat combo, I got the pork ribs, brisket & my sides were Mac & cheese and pinto beans. The ribs & brisket were seasoned to perfection, as for the ribs it was a little dry & I was expecting for it to fall off the bone but it didn't, still good & big af though. Same for the brisket, it was a little dry but taste wise it was excellent, I also love the fatty part of it because it had the right amount of salt to give the meaty part some flavor. Mac and cheese were above average, I love cheese but got damn did y'all pour the entire cow in there. I am not a fan of pinto beans but these were fantastic, it had a nice kick of spice. Overall, I enjoyed my birthday lunch and I'll definitely come back next time.
