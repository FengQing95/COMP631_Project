Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////But. They get overly ambitious and do egregious things like charge $14 for a mediocre meatball sandwich. I'm sure it was grass-fed beef/pork on a hoagie made from yeast that they culture or something, but there are so many great places for lunch in Houston that I will never waste that opportunity again; it was so underwhelming. The menu changes though, so perhaps it's worth a shot some other day.
