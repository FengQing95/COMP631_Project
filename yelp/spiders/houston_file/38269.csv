Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Food was excellent! Service was excellent! Constant bussing of tables and tending to your needs. It was a wee bit loud but over all, not so bad. Nice selection of drinks, but known for their whiskey. Lots of space and plenty of room for groups or an intimate date with your partner. Highly recommend the pulled pork hush puppies and the Mac and cheese!
