Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday afternoon. Parking is scarce. To drink we started off with some mimosas.  For our meals we ordered from the weekend brunch, they have a menu for the weekday as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon and egg flatbread , it was delicious and crispy. It does have a red sauce that was semisweet but still a good pairing for the flatbread. I ended up getting the French toast which was very fluffy and sweet.  They had a wide variety of desserts, will try to come back to taste !
