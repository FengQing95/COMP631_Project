Local Foods////I finally made it out to Local Foods after having lived here for a couple years! I ordered the crunchy chicken sandwich as per most everyone's recommendation along with the soba noodles and tuscan kale as sides. My brother got the bacon sandwich as well as the homemade chips and fresh fruit. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, and pretty much everyone there was drinking the blood orange lemonade -- I guess I'll have to try that next time! When our orders came the food looked really good. Although the sides appeared small, they were actually pretty filling. My brother got a lot of chips. I was a little surprised that the fresh fruit was just two small oranges, but they seemed pretty tasty. The sauce on my sides was a little lemony(?) for my liking, but I really enjoyed my sandwich. I wish there had been more crunch, though. The bun and the sauce were the best parts (very delicious!). My brother really liked his sandwich, as well. Overall, a pretty good place to eat; I'm not sure if it was worth all of the massive hype around it, but I would like to come back sometime and try the shrimp & crab sandwich and the butternut squash bisque.
