Kata Robata////Came here for my wife's birthday after reading some great reviews.   The decor was nice.  We came at the end of happy hour (5-7pm) and it is definitely worth it as long as you order the items by 7pm.  They have a number of robata and roll on the happy hour menu.  It's $2-3 off the regular menu price.  Off the happy hour menu we ordered a couple of rolls, chicken and beef robata and tuna tar tar.  We also ordered the spider rainbow roll and the chilean sea bass off the regular menu.  We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of pieces that came with each roll.  All of the rolls were very good but the crunchy eel roll was especially good and will definitely order it again.  The spider rainbow roll was good but it didn't have the pretty large spider legs coming out of the roll that we usually see in a spider roll.  Both the spicy tuna and spicy salmon roll were good but not extraordinary.
