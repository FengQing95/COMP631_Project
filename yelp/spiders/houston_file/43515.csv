Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You know.... Their coffee isn't that good. There. I said it. Ev-er-y time I get a latte or cappuccino there (and I am not one to add sugar to my coffee), it's burnt!!! That's about half a dozen burnt coffees y'all. That aside, the pastries are nomz. Their croissants are the perfect amount of fluffy, flaky, and buttery. I'm not personally a fan of the kugelhopf as I didn't appreciate the sweetness and chunks of fruit but that's just me! The kouign amman is a pastry that looks like it's upside down. It is such buttery caramelized goodness. Their brunch/lunch entrees are very savory and heavy. It's one of those things where it's really good but since it's so rich, I cannot finish it. It's so heavy that I don't find myself enjoying the entree past the halfway point. So far one of my more favorite lunch items is the duck confit sandwich. Because it's so savory, no sides are needed. Menu is seasonal so check it regularly!
