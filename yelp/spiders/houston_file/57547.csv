Kata Robata////We tried the happy hour fried brussel sprouts, king salmon sashimi, fatty tuna sashimi, foie gras, duck soba noodles, and uni crab shooters. All were melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The fried brussel sprouts were crispy, sweet, and savory. The sashimi were buttery and fresh. The foie gras and uni were also super tasty, and the duck soba noodles were a delicious filler as well.
