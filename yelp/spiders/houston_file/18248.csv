Uchi////The last time I was here, was the grand opening of Uchi. I came back with some friends for happy hour, and we went full on dumb mode and ordered almost everything on the menu. I was pretty satisfied with everything that we had and everything from the appetizers to the desserts were on point. A friend of mine is a chef and sent us over another bottle of the same sake we were drinking and it was a total surprise and well received. Hosts and waiters were attentive and took care of us very well. They really stepped their game up. It's not only about the food but the service as well.
