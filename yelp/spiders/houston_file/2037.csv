JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////First time here and what a great refreshing change. Hubby had the spicy chicken ramen inferno and said it was great. I had Tonkotsu black and that had all my favorite ingredients in one. Vincent had spicy something or another and said it was good too. Thank goodness we have one closer to home. Very great place to eat. I am coming back. Oh yes wait staff wonderful on the money and polite.
