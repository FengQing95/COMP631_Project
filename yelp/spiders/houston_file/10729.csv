JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The service is great, I didn't see, hear, or encounter a single disrespectful employee. The atmosphere itself is really nice. The host/hostess will announce your arrival with an "irasshai" (which while incredibly awkward, is a nice touch). Irasshai means welcome and so you get a warm welcoming as you enter the back area (Or as I call it the ramen area. The front area is the bar in "ramen bar".). I have only being a sad otaku for knowing the meaning of this.
