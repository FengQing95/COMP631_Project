Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////The second time that I came here was for the brunch service. This place is usually booked up two weeks in advance, so I was lucky enough to catch an open reservation time a week in advance. I've been wanting to try the fruity pebbles French toast (which is their iconic brunch item). But they also had other delicious options as well. The great thing about having a S/O is that they can order something that you like, and you can order something different, and share, so you essentially get the best of both worlds when going out to eat because you can try a bit of everything. So my boyfriend actually ordered the fruity pebble French toast and I ordered the chilaquiles. It was absolutely divine. The fruity pebbles satisfied my sweet tooth (though it was incredibly sweet, so drink that water!) and the chilaquiles was savory to balance out the sweetness of the French toast. Both meals were equally appetizing and aesthetically pleasing, but the French toast was of course more colorful. I couldn't be able to decide between the two of which I liked more; they were both just wonderfully yummy.
