Baby Barnaby's////I love this spot so much, the food is awesome. The portions are huge and you will leave with a full belly. The reason I give it 2 stars is because of the service. The same guy has been working here for quite awhile now and he gets ruder every time we see him. You would think it would be the opposite since we were becoming regulars. The waiter is super passive aggressive and sarcastic. Today is the last time we will probably be coming here, we walked in and he didn't acknowledge us at all. Finally when he decided to acknowledge us a couple of unnecessary comments were made and we left. I've never been to an establishment with such an attitude towards their customers. Love the food, but I can find breakfast food without the attitude elsewhere.
