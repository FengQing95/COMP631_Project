Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Waited about 45 min for 1 seat but it was Mother's Day. Drinks aren't served till 10, so I didn't get a mimosa that day. I tried a few things from the menu. French toast was ok. Prices are ok. Because I got two items I took food home. It was highly reviewed by Yelp so I had to try it out.
