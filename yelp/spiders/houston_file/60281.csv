Baby Barnaby's////A couple of friends and I were in the area looking to get a spot at Snooze, but never realized they had such a long line. We eventually ended up at this Cafe and I must say it was probably for the best because they food was amazing. The proportions were great and the service was impeccable. Our server, I forget his name at this time was hilarious and attentive which only added to our awesome time here. This is THE place to get your breakfast and brunch.
