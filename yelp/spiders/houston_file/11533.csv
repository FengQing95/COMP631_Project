JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The restaurant has a garage behind it you can either park for free or valet park in. You can also meter park on the street. Inside there's two bars you can sit at, communal tables, and booths. My friends and I ordered takoyaki for an appetizer, jinya no. 1 and chasu rice bowl. It was very flavorful. I had the chasu rice bowl because ramen usually doesn't fill me up. It comes in two sizes. They give you a lot of meat which I liked but the sauce was a bit too salty. I had my glass of water refilled 4x because I kept drinking it all. The waitress was very nice and came often. They also allowed us to split checks here.
