Uchi////Unfortunately, quite a few of the servings were not even of the ocean, including duck and rib-eye. Strangely, those were the tastiest and most memorable. I would accept that it's just "unconventional" if all the more traditional plates didn't suffer from a lack of originality, freshness and excitement. Omakase dishes should complement one another but also each be a unique "dance" of flavors. We saw none of this, so much as random plates being sent our way.
