JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favorite ramen spot. I must order an extra egg in my soup every time, the eggs are so good. I haven't really ordered anything other than the chicken ramen. Why would you get anything other than ramen at a ramen bar? I have only ordered take out from JINYA, so I can't comment on their dining experience. After getting takeout dozens of times they have always gotten my order right. Sometimes it is very crowded inside when I pick up my order.
