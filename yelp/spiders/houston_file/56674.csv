Kata Robata////My girlfriend and I hit up the restaurant on a Monday at 5:00 pm, as they were about to start their dinner service. Though there was a small line coming out the door, we were immediately seated upon entering the restaurant. Our waitress was friendly, and was fairly knowledgeable about the food/drinks.
