Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Make sure that when you head to the location that you consider a wait because as I stated, the food is super yummy and everyone knows, which is why usually there's a wait usually around 20-30mins depending on what time you go. For my medical professionals, this is a great spot for breakfast after completing a night shift! Great drinks and prices, but pace yourself! Definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots in the city!
