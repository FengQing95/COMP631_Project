Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Very friendly and courteous staff. I tried their egg sandwich and it was really good. I got the vanilla latte and it was just right for me, not too sweet or strong. I will definitely be coming back again. Did I mention their pastries are delicious too? If you're into coffee and pastries like I am, this is a place you can't miss.
