JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My favourite ramen is the Spicy Tonkotsu (make it hot)! Â Their broth is super rich and flavourful, the pork melts in your mouth, and my favourite part is their thin noodles, which brought back the wonderful memories of the BEST Hakata-style ramen I had when I was in Fukuoka. I didn't think it was possible for any ramen place (that isn't straight up in Japan) to come close, or match, the true ramen experience I had. Every time I eat here, I have to remind myself to slow down, savour, and enjoy my ramen because I can clean the entire bowl in 5 minutes flat... it is THAT good!
