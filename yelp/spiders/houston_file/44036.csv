Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////A friend of mine and I biked here together on a Friday afternoon. By the time we arrived so many of the pastries -- croissants and the like -- already had big "Sold Out" signs behind their name tags. Of the few options left were mocha cupcakes, lemon tarts, and several types of macarons.
