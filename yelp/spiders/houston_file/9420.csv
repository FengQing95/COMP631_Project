JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food was absolutely amazing. I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and added the beef. The flavor was perfect. My boyfriend added chicken to his however, was lacking a little flavor. Overall had a great experience! However, it seemed they were cleaning their kitchen floors with a really strong smell (smelled like fabuloso) not very appetizing when trying to eat food. Would suggest to not use strong chemicals while customers are still eating.
