JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I found roaches in my ramen, the manager said not to worried about it, it's (protein) according to him. I'm a native Houstonian and I grew up in Bellaire, I have never been told that's a usual understanding in this type of establishment. Please do not visit this place, unless you are willing to deal w rats and Â roaches.
