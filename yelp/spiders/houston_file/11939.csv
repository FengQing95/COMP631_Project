JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Andrea - Thanks for your review. We appreciate your feedback. I wish you could have notified your server that your chashu was cold. We always recommend customers take their noodles from the bottom of the bowl and bring them to the top to "activate" their ramen, which effectively heats the toppings which are always placed last in the bowl. We're always happy to remake a bowl if it does not meet our customers' satisfaction 100%. I hope this won't deter you from coming back to JINYA. We appreciate your business and hope to serve you again.
