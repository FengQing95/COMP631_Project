Kata Robata////I really love this sushi place. Their Ocean Picante rolls and Caribbean rolls are great. Their bluefin toro is amazing (if you are into it). You can order real wasabi for $7 (instead of horseradish). I have been here many times over the years, and I have always been delighted with the sushi.
