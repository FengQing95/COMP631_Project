Uchi////Uchi is a Japanese-inspired restaurant (started by a "white guy in Austin," according to our waiter) that offers creative takes on Japanese flavors, in addition to sushi rolls, nigiri, and sashimi. Every item on the expansive menu is served as a small plate, which makes them perfect for sharing, but do be warned that these add up quickly in price.
