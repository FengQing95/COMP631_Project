Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Very cool restaurant but I have mixed feelings. The music is way too loud. The boulevardier cocktail was a touch too sweet and the hot chicken dip was pretty dull (if you've ever had real Nashville hot chicken you will be disappointed). The house made chips accompanying it were really good. The house made seasonal pickles were terrific, though, fresh and vibrant with okra, bell peppers, cauliflower Â and carrots. I imagine it changes over time. The hot brown turkey sandwich was great - creamy and flavorful. I have no idea about its authenticity, not being from Kentucky, but it was quite tasty. The black eyed pea patty sandwich was super yummy, kinda nutty and a teeny bit spicy. The fries we ordered didn't come out with the entrees and we had to wait a while because the server didn't write it down when we placed the order. They were amazing, however late, thick wedges that were crispy crunchy on the outside and tender inside. This place has the potential to be amazing but the inconsistencies need to be resolved. The service is amateur., albeit very friendly. These are nice folks, they just need to be trained properly. If this was a less expensive place I would have given 4 stars, but given the price point I expect more.
