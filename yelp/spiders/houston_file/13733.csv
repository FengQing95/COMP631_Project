JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The only thing that bugs me about JINYA is the blaring music, because I'm old and crotchety.  I can barely hear what the person across/besides me is saying sometimes, which I guess, makes for a rather somber meal of us stuffing our faces and smiling.  That might be an overall positive thing depending on how many raw cloves you've crushed into your bowl, am I right?!
