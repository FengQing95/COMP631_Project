Local Foods////Visited today and it was delicious. And the service was fast and friendly. I had the garden sammie with chicken at the recommendation of the employee who took my order. It was amazing. Tasted very fresh (veges were really really tasty) and the sandwich was huge. I could only eat half. I had the local fruit and tuscan kale for sides. Local fruit was grapefruit, which was cutely cut up and as good as the best grapefruit I've purchased at a grocery store. The kale salad had a wonderful dressing. Now, in the midst of my quest for healthier lunch options close by... there was a delectable vegan carrot cupcake screaming at me beside the register. Who am I to ignore a cupcake...a vegan cupcake at that. I absolutely had to try it to see if it could possibly be better than a non-vegan carrot cupcake. IT WAS BETTER!!! If I never have a non-vegan carrot cupcake again, I will be just fine. The frosting was kind of sweet, but the cupcake flavor is so good, you almost eat it too fast to notice. All in all, I will definitely be going back to try other options.
