The Pit Room////Dropped by after seeing all the reviews on Yelp. Got the brisket sandwich with a side of beans. Brisket is definitely some of the best I've had. The char was beautiful. The meat was so juicy and tender. However, the beans were a bit of a let down. A little flat and one dimensional on the flavor.
