Baby Barnaby's////I came to this location for the first time with 2 of my friends, and one is a new mother with twins. My friend placed our names on the sign in sheet. My friend and I waited out in the heat for about an hour because there's limited shaded area. And our friend set in the car with her baby girls. As we waited we noticed how friendly the host was to customers he called to be seated, he greeted ever customer very nicely and thank them for the long wait. When it came time for my friends and I to be seated, the host called for us and a couple. The couple was ahead of us and the host again, greeted them very nicely. The host saw my friend and I and attitude changes. He yells at us, "where's your third party?, I don't see three person". We apologize and told him we didn't know the entire party needed to be present to be seated. We told him she was in the car with her baby girls. He continued with an attitude, and tells us she need to get out the car or we won't be seated. At the moment we decided with that unwelcome attitude just to go somewhere else. We went decided on Dish Society and the service was incredible!
