JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with butter and a seasoned egg and thick noodles. I was really impressed! The broth was incredibly flavorful and the spice was perfect. My noodles were good, some were clumped together looking a little over cooked but for the most part I was satisfied. The butter comes in a little cup and is a big chunk, at least a tablespoon. I found that I only needed about half of that to get that rich flavor throughout the broth. We also tried the pork gyoza which we enjoyed. Overall this place lived up to all our expectations and we will definitely be back!
