Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////You have to get there at 7 AM or you're waiting 2 hours, but it's worth the wait! The french toast is amazing and the corned beef hash is also good. Their green hot sauce is AWESOME. I want it on everything. Staff is very attentive and the place is clean. Parking can be hectic but it's Montrose so plan accordingly!
