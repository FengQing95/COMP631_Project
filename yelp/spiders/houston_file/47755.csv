Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food is amazing with good prices and the option to substitute for vegetarian option. If you like to eggs Benedict's then you will love this place. Downside is the line- if u come closer to opening time then there's no problem but if you wake up around 10 ish 11 ish on the weekend then a wait can be up to 1 hr. But food is worth it :)
