Uchi////Our main plates for the evening consisted of the following: itoyori (threadfin bream), bluefin otoro (fatty tuna), anago (sea eel), ike-hotate (hokkaido scallop), duck nigiri, hot rock, and foie gras.  We also got to try the kori kaki, courtesy of our waitress that night--I imagine it was because the kitchen was starting to get backed up with orders.  A nice gesture indeed, but I wasn't a fan of it... it probably has to primarily do with the fact that I don't think oysters are appetizing in any shape, form, or fashion.  The duck nigiri was interesting, to say the least.  It was a cold cut of meat and had an unexpected texture.  The hot rock did not disappoint (when would it ever?! preposterous) and the foie gras delivered an orgasm-like sensation in my mouth.
