Local Foods////The Pretzel-Bun. Honey, listen. GET IT. Now I am a lover of bread, but just saying I wish I could have all my sandwiches on this bun. It's sooooo good. Bae and I randomly stopped by for lunch one day were were thoroughly pleased. I had the Egg Salad sandwich (great) and he had the Steak sandwich (great). We both had the chicken soup which was also very good. Our food came out quickly and the staff was friendly (and allowed us to sample the soup prior to buying). We have no complaints and will be back!
