Local Foods////My hubby and I came here to eat lunch. He had ordered the duck confit with house chips, and I had ordered the egg sandwich with kale and beets. When we received it, they messed up our orders. They had put the egg sandwich with the house chips and the duck confit with my sides. As being this was our first time here, they didn't change our sandwiches around. I know that people make mistakes but shouldn't you do it correctly? So, we gave the service 3 stars. Our sandwiches were delish but we have to factor in with the service.
