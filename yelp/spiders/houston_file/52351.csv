Kata Robata////A total disappointment. The menu looked SO good, but failed to deliver. I sent back two cocktails for being undrinkably unbalanced and they still charged us for one. Plus, we tried five dishes and none of them were very good. Not bad, but not good. What a waste of a dinner, especially because it was my birthday. We wanted to have the outstanding chef's tasting we had there two years ago, but they don't do it any more. Maybe it was so disappointing because we went on a Monday night Â instead of a Saturday night???
