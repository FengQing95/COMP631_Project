Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I really liked the restaurant, the music, vibe was amazing. Prices were reasonable. I don't think I would take my kids again. The menu selection is delicious however it's minimal because they have an amazing chef. The staff, waiters are awesome. One or two things were forgotten but they didn't charge us. Friendly environment, great location. Inside outside seating. The drinks were delicious.
