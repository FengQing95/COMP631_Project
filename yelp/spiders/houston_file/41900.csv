Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Finally made it to CB and it was worth the wait. The almond crescent with a latte was a perfect way to start the day and a great reward after fasting for a cholesterol test. And yes, if test results are good I'll be back for more! Â The almond mixture in this pastry was perfect and addictive. I went around 8:30 on a Thursday so no issues with parking, but that will never happen on a weekend.
