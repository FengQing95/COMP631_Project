The Pit Room////The first time I visited last year, this was fantastic and on par with Gatlin's. I could see why this BBQ joint was on Texas Monthly's top 50 BBQ places to eat in the state. The brisket was moist and easily fell apart, to the point where I'd give this place four stars. But then I returned earlier this year, and the brisket was really dry. I needed a knife to cut through the slices (blasphemy for BBQ!), so I give three stars.
