JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is worth the hype! Even in the heat of Houston, their ramen is so good and refreshing. Fresh noodles, broth was filled with flavor. We had the fried chicken as an appetizer, it did not disappoint. I ordered the #1, the most popular ramen selection. No need to add any extra toppings. I'm in awe. Even though it's pretty pricey, I think it's worth the price. Try to come one hour before or after the popular times because this place gets packed fast!
