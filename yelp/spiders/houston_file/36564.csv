Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Love the staff, love the selection of whisky and beer, and the food is pretty darn tasty. I had the pleasure of trying a couple dishes before I decided to make a lifestyle change and go vegan. I still think meat is delicious, I choose this for many other reasons. I encourage you to do it to, but before you do, try the meatloaf.It's an appetizer and I forgot the name but it's awesome Still coming here for the drinks and staff! Oh, salmon was good too. I was on the hunt for the best mac and cheese as well which is overbut theirs was good enough to order again. Please take into account that I was a mac and cheese snob and love eating at 3 Michelin star restaurants so please take into the count of people and their reviews! I'm picky picky picky!
