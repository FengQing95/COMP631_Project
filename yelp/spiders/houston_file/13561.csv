JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I always order this. I really like the flavorful broth and the fatty chashu. The egg is always marinated well, but lately it's been really salty and not as runny as before. I always order a side of broccoli to off balance some of the saltiness and heaviness of the broth, but hands down this is the best ramen I've had anywhere; so I keep coming back for it.
