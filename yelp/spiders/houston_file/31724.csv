Local Foods////I'm not gonna say I love everything about this place - I don't love the decor, and from the outside, there is nothing really unique about it from the outside or from the vibe either.  But I can say I LOVE the food.  It was...incredible.  Had the duck confit sandwich and lemon pepper soup.  I gotta say, I love the duck.  It was the moistest duck I've ever had (and I'm Asian, so I've had a pretty good amount of duck).  The flavors melded so well, together.  The brie...the arugula...the cranberry...oh the cranberry ah!  My friend had it with the pretzel bread which I want to try next time.  I had the wheat bread which was also very good.  Re: the soup.  There was this subtle tiny crunch in the soup, I think from the lemon grass, which was absolutely divine..and addicting.  I had to go for more until the bottom of the bowl.  Finally, we had one of the small desserts.  It was a brownie, chocolate thing.  It had some type of nut, and again, the subtle crunch got me good.  So good!!  Best sandwich I've had in a VERY long time if ever.  Best sandwich I've had since moving to Houston (a year ago).  With possible (but not likely) the exception being this one Vietnamese sandwich place.
