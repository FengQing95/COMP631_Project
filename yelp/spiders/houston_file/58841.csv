Baby Barnaby's////It took me about 30 min to get to this place. (Worth it) Street/ parallel parking is a must but was easy enough to find for me and my buddy perhaps due to the time (9:30am) and location of this place. I found parking around the block and walked into a cute little restaurant. I didn't realize how tiny the place would be. According to a sign inside the max occupancy is 35. How cute. I look around and I love the decor and whole environment. Colorful decorations (including the ceiling), pictures, menu on the wall, and then I spot the orange juice machine! Ohmydamn. It looked like a cassette tape (that thing before CDs existed) with two reels holding 3 half oranges each spinning to get every drop of OJ out. Legit. The place was full, but lucky for us, we didn't have to wait too long whatsoever. I wasted no time to order OJ.
