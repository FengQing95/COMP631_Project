Local Foods////After 2 days in a row of leaving the hospital and going by taco cabana bout of convenience, my body was screaming for real food and for greens in particular. Trusty yelp brought up Local Foods when I typed in salad and looking over their menu got me excited. I called in my order, asked the guy on the other end what he would suggest and he said he could go on and on about anything cause it's all great. I got the harvest salad and because I was starving decided I needed a side of the kale salad and beet salad as well.
