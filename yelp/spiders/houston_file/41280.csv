Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////at this point, this is my fave for coffee and pastry. i have been described as picky and elitist when it comes to both, having spent a lot of time in Paris. service and ambience go along with great coffee and pastry. since i love pastry, i have not tried the egg etc breakfast. consider myself a regular.
