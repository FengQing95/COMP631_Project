Kata Robata////One of the most phenomenal Japanese dining experiences. We came for a late lunch and Thai was the most wonderful waiter. His recommendations were spot on. I particularly enjoyed their fusion dish with foie gras. I told him my gluten allergy and what seafood I preferred not to eat and he sorted out the rest. To top it off, their creme brûlée I cannot fault! Totally spoilt here!
