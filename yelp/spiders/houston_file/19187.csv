Uchi////Kue: grouper nigiri sushi. We had actually ordered kamasu which was barracuda. Unfortunately, they ran out :( I've never tried barracuda before. They took the kamasu off our bill and gave this to us for free. Sweet, fresh. You don't even need soy sauce. Actually I think soy sauce would have masked it's natural yummy flavor.
