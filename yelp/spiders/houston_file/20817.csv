Uchi////4. Fried Milk - I still lament the extinction of the Cracked Black Pepper Sorbet, an impeccably constructed dessert (see my Uchi Austin review for more). The sorbet itself is on Houston's menu, just not the full dish. The fried milk, while not nearly as refreshing as a sorbet, is a nice, heavy alternative. The toasted milk looks like tongue-in-cheek Rodeo fare, but it tastes eons better than a disgusting batch of Fried Oreos. Crispy on the outside, smooth on the inside, and tasty throughout. It was by far the best of the three desserts I tried.
