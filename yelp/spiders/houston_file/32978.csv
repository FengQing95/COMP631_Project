Local Foods////It's everything you would hope for from a place called "Local Foods." The staff, decor, and music are hip. The menu items are fresh and interesting. I enjoyed the crunchy chicken sandwich on pretzel bun with soup. The vegan sides were a little too healthy for my taste. The patrons were Rice students and professors, or so I imagined.
