Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service (5/5): Some of the best service I've experienced in quite some time. My waiter was attentive, described each dish, and was on top of everything from start to finish. The rest of the staff was just as friendly as several other members of the staff stopped by to chat and to make sure I had everything I needed. This was echoed at the top as I had a chance to meet the manager (or owner?) John who also made me feel right at home. They all treated me like a king so I appreciate the generosity!
