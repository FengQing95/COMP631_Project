Local Foods////After a quick tour of Rice Campus, my friend wanted to grab lunch at a place she can't find in Sugar Land. So I suggested Local Foods. I love exposing people to new dining experiences.  We arrived just in time to beat the lunch crowd.  This dining establishment is order at the counter so grab a menu and peruse it while waiting in line.  If you are not sure what side to choose, take a quick look-see at them in the glass display at the counter.
