Baby Barnaby's////I'm OBSESSED with Barnaby's so I thought I would also be obsessed with Baby Barnaby's but I didn't find that to be the case (are they completely separate? They may be, honestly no clue). The breakfast menu had a decent selection but I found my food to be almost flavorless. No one at my table was very impressed... with so many great places, I definitely will not be returning. I was displeased with my service or the food but it's nothing to write home about.
