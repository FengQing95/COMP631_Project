Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food here is really good. However, the service at the Memorial location could use a bit of work. The front desk employees make snarky remarks within earshot of the customers. I understand this isn't The Ritz, but the employees should be more cognizant of their surroundings and at least try to whisper.
