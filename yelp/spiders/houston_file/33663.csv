Local Foods////The food was healthy and delicious.  There are tables outside and it's kids and pet friendly.  The staff are nice and was a great place catch up with friends.  A very laid back place to hang out to chit chat.  The food is reasonably priced and it was definitely filling.  I wouldn't mind going back but not my first choice.
