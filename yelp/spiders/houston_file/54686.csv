Kata Robata////Without a doubt in my mind, Kata Robata has to be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Houston. (Of course, my absolute favorite is Uchi, but Kata Robata is up there). Whether it's a birthday celebration, or a great work-week reward, or some crazy boy drama you need to drown out, or an insatiable desire for ramen, my friends and I always resort to Kata Robata. They have an excellent menu, great quality of food and amazing ambiance.
