Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I LOVED this place. Warning, parking kind of stinks but it's worth it. The food was a little on the pricier side for breakfast but I still thought it was amazing. Even if you don't want eggs or quiche or a sandwich, the bakery itself has such yummy goodies. The almond croissant was amazing, along with the lavender iced latte I had. I like how they have healthier options too for brunch, or something heartier. The line does form outside but don't be intimidated, it goes by at a good pace.
