The Pit Room////My favorites so far have been - Hutchins in Frisco, Tenders in Frisco, Coopers in Austin, the Smoke Shack in San Antonio and now......The Pit Room in Houston.  All I can say is WOW.  I got the 2 meat plate with Moist Brisket, Jalapeño Cheddar smoked  sausage with Potato Salad and smoked green beans.
