The Pit Room////Visiting Houston for the weekend and wanted some BBQ - The Pit Room deserves all the hype! When we arrived the line was out the door but moving along steadily. They offer meat plates, bbq sandwiches, tacos, and even frito pie! I had the frito pie with chopped brisket. Best meal of the week while visiting! Plenty of space outside for eating as well. Don't let the line fool you, it moves fast and you honestly won't regret it!
