Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came to Common Bond after hearing rave reviews and going to Empire Cafe and realizing that biscuits weren't on their menu. The atmosphere was very vibrant and welcoming. The staff were knowledgeable about their product and were very eager to please. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with the gravy on the side (don't judge me) and I added their blackberry preserves. I also had their drip coffee. The biscuits were very moist, and flavorful, the number one flavor being butter. I would compare the texture to that of a "country style" biscuit. The gravy was a few pinches of pepper away from being phenomenal! It was creamy but held the right viscosity, the crumbled sausage held up well to it. I wouldn't say the blackberry preserves were stellar but they were pretty normal. I wasn't wowed by them but they left nothing to desire. Their drip coffee was robust, definitely not a light bodied coffee. I like that type of flavor so it was a good cup of joe. I'm giving Common Bond 4 stars only because of their very limited space. This place is packed, but it was no different from any other stand up bakery in Houston. I will definitely be going back!
