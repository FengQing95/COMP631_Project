Uchi////We returned today to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the dinner was just as exquisite. Highlights were the pumpkin tempura, medium fatty toro (imported from Japan), hot rock wagyu, and a pumpkin spice dessert that I can't remember the name of. On top of that, our waiter, Jose, was incredible; excellent service, great advice about menu items.
