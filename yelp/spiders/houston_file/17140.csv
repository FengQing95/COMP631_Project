JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Came here on our last night in Houston and I'm so glad we did. Came a little over an hour before closing and this place was packed. Luckily we were seated immediately at the center bar table. Intimate environment. Dim lights with wooden bar tables. There is an open bar at the entrance of the restaurant.
