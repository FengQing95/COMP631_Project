Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband & I returned this past weekend to Bosscat for our second visit. Everything from start to finish was amazing! Host was super friendly & quickly took us to our table. Our waiter - Terry was very informative of all menu items & very friendly. We really enjoyed every interaction with him, always had us laughing. We met Mark (manger) very nice & eager to make sure we were happy. Also met both owners - Tai & John, both very nice & genuinely interested in our dining experience. We went with the Pig candy (terry made us! Lol) for an app & it was delicious!!! Avocado chop salad to follow, also his recommendation & very good, light & fresh. Very big serving, enough to plate up for 3-4 ppl. I ordered the burger exactly as Chef prefers to make it & it was delicious!!! Husband got the shrimp & grits (same dish he got last visit) and again really enjoyed it. We also got the Mac & cheese, it's was different, not bad, not great just ok. Churros for dessert which are SO good!! Looking forward to our next visit!
