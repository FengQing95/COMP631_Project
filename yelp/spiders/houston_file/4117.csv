JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I went to Jinya Ramen Bar with my nephew and we both agreed that from the moment we walked in, staff made us feel welcome. Located in Midtown, Jinya is appropriately stylish and we liked the decor, especially the funky light fixtures hanging over the tables. We went on a Sunday about 4 PM, so it was not too crowded and there was parking available in the garage. Not sure if they have enough dedicated spots for a busy lunch or dinner hour, though.
