Uchi////I've been to Uchi on multiple locations. Their fish is EXTREMELY FRESH. Like "it might have swam its way into the restaurant" fresh. There's a different selection every day and the wait staff is great at making recommendations based on your tastes. Not only do they have fresh sashimi and sushi, they also have "cold tastings" that pair the fish with different seasonings, sauces, fruits, and so forth.
