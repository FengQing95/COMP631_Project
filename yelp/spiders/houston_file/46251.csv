Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We have never been to Common Bond Bistro & Bakery, but we were very excited to try it since the location seemed nice and the food looked delicious. However, the customer service left us not wanting to return as it was busy we were told to wait by a gentleman that may have been the manager on duty until it calmed down a bit and tables became available. However, after a few minutes were we told by another employee that it was okay to enter and we ordered our pastry. The same gentleman asked us who allowed us in and we explained. He once again informed us that there are no tables and we would have to wait. He did not state an estimated wait time nor that we had only the option to order for take out or eat outside in this hot Houston weather. Once it was our time to get to the register and order our main meal the cashier told finally informed us that we could only eat outside or to take out. We were disappointed to have waited nearly an hour to finally be informed of this. After poor communication with the staff and the customers we will not be attempting to try them which is such a shame.
