The Pit Room////Go eat at the Pit Room! It's literally one of the best bbq spots in Houston. I've been numerous time. It gets crowded (for good reason) during the week and parking is limited (corporate lunch crowd) so go early...as close to 11am as possible. I haven't been on the weekend so I'm not sure if the busy times.
