Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Awesome food!  Cool atmosphere. Nice servers. And did I mention awesome food?!  For folks with gluten allergies like me, it's a true joy to find a place that accommodates my allergies and they did. The gluten free blueberry pancakes were to DIE FOR!  And everything I've had here is fantastic. Highly recommend. And great drinks too!  This will quickly become your favorite breakfast / brunch spot!
