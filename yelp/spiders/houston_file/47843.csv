Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The service is wonderful, food is delicious and I always leave feeling satisfied! Definitely recommend this as one of the top brunch/breakfast places in Houston if you're in the mood of not having to dress up super fancy and having a yummy meal. Recommend the assortment of French toast and pancakes!!!
