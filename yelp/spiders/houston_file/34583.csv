Local Foods////This is the second location I try and I loved it as well. This one was a lot more crowded and more of a order ay the counter service but the staff was still on point making recommendations and cleaning up the tables. I had the quinoa burger on the gluten free wrap which was delicious. It's a huge portion so I could not finish all of it but took it home. I also tried the Ros√© wine which was on their HH which was great.
