Kata Robata////I came back for Happy Hour last Friday and ordered the Pork Belly Bao, Crunchy Eel Roll, and Kobe Beef Tacos. I made a reservation for 5:15 and the restaurant was empty but by the time we left the restaurant, it was packed! I would recommend making an earlier reservation if possible. My total was around $19. I prefer the lunch specials to the Happy Hour specials but it's definitely worth a try!
