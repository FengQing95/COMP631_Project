The kale side is a little bland for me, but they do make the kale taste good without hiding it behind something, and still have a good crunch; that's impressive enough for me. A great draft option or two. Hint of Asian fusion Viet flavors, sharing a kitchen with Thai Spice: Thai basil in the sandwich, soybeans and peanut in the slaw side, coconut milk in the soup. I found myself scraping with my fork to get every scrap. Totally worth the money, will happily return.
