JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The spicy chicken ramen (spicy flavor) is flavorful. It's not that spicy so I ended up adding more spicy sauce provided on the table. I also ordered the seasoned egg which was disappointing. It's definitely nothing like Japan nor worth it to order as an additional side.you can barely taste the seasoning because they stick it in your ramen bowl. U I got the spinach noodles instead of the thin noodles for an extra $2. I wish they didn't charge extra but I do like they have this substitution and still enjoyed the noodles. Others may think the ramen is less without the actual noodles but to each his own.
