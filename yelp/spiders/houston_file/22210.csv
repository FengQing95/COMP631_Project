Uchi////Hot tastings: Hamachi nabe (baby yellowtail, koshi hikari rice, farm egg, soy broth).  This one was also very delicious and came out on a sizzling bowl and they poured the soy broth over it at the table and mixed it all up very nicely.  Although both dishes were yellowtail, they tasted completely different!
