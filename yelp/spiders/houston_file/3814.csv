JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The ramen that was served to to me and the people I brought was more than satisfying. Service was excellent and very prompt so you can imagine we did not have to wait very long. What we found very intriguing to this place was the atmosphere and ambience; it was very lively and paired well with the served food.
