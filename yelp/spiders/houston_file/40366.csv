Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Pretty cool vibe, super nice staff and delicious drinks and eats. What's not to love?  We had an array of apps with the Pig Candy being the Star  - it's a must try.  But then again the Pork Belly Poutine and Brussel Sprouts were delicious as well. Nothing was over salted (my pet peeve).
