Uchi////* Next time I will skip the maki altogether. The rolls taste good, but there's too little fish, and what's there is overpowered by other flavors. The spicy crunchy tuna roll was particularly disappointing as the ratio of cucumber to tuna inside the roll was about 6:1. (And what is this place doing using fake krab in some rolls?)
