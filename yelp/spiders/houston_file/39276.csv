Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We picked this restaurant based on all the reviews, but we did not have the same experience. Our party ordered the pork belly poutine, short rib grilled cheese, Dr. Pepper Wings, Seoul steak, and a the chicken corn chowder. The corn chowder was sent back because nobody in our party liked it. The steak, and other dishes were just mediocre. However, we all really enjoyed the grilled cheese. It was unique and had great flavor.
