Local Foods////This place is perfect for a post-family dinner, post Thanksgiving, post celebration/holiday detox (unless you're from a vegan family or attended a vegan party). A bunch of girls and I went to Local Foods to give our bodies a much needed treat after a heavy, unhealthy, and fattening Thanksgiving meal. I really liked the food. I had a Vegetarian Winter Bisque and a Falafel Sandwich. It was all delicious, so why only 3 stars? I felt as if the food won! I know the food is really good for me, for my body, etc etc, but I couldn't finish it! I took it home for lunch tomorrow, but I really wanted to devour it like I would a burger.
