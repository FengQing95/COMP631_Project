Kata Robata////The food is ok.. but 90 minutes is all you get at the table and trust me they are timing it. Had you let me know that when I booked my reservation that we only had 90 minutes for appetizers and dinner Â I would not have booked. The food is not great at all. Their are a ton of amazing restaurants in houston that are not timing you and actually let you enjoy your dinner.. not coming back.
