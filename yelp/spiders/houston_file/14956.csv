JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ramen has really boosted in popularity in the past couple of years and all with good reason! I've been hearing wonders about this place for a while now but I've been stuck on a favorite (Tiger Den, in Chinatown). First off I want to mention the wait, something that is pretty common with hyped up restaurants. I came here on Sunday at 8:45pm and was told the wait was 30 minutes, which was about accurate (so avoid busy times if you don't want to wait). The seating is cramped, again, not untypical for ramen joints. Unfortunately we sat next to a couple who felt it appropriate to sit next to each other and feed each other ramen. The PDA didn't annoy me but the fact that they thought it was ok to sit next to each other in already cramped seating and ruin the experience for the people dining on both sides of them, did. Anyway, we ordered the jinya buns, pork gyoza, spicy tonkotsu with add ins (corn, fried onion, bokchoy, seasoned egg & fresh garlic) and a bowl of spicy umami miso ramen with add ins (fried onion, extra pork belly, seasoned egg).
