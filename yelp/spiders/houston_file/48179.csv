Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Honestly, not worth the wait of ~2 hours. They have good food, but it can be very heavy (especially the pancakes) because they put a TON of butter, oil, and sugar in their sweet dishes. I enjoyed the omelette, but found it to be comparable to other restaurants that don't have long waits (I love you, Canopy!). The first time I went, there was a table open for 20 minutes before I was allowed to sit down, and they definitely just let the phone ring without answering (minus one star for service). I've gone again a few months later, and their operations have gotten more efficient, but still an ongoing challenge the staff will need to address.
