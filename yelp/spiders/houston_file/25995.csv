The Pit Room////This little spot may be slim on parking but it's very fat on flavor. Witnessing the slicing open of a fresh piece of brisket steaming & tender as it separated from its coat of butcher block paper definitely sealed the deal on which meat to get with our 1 meat plate. Cozied up with sides of mac & cheese, slaw, and potatoe salad, the brisket they give you is a very generous portion & does not disappoint the palate. The bark makes this meat candy. Similarly their mustardy potatoe salad was an unexpected highlight. Mac & cheese was very good too. Coleslaw, though lookin' good, was unfortunately a letdown containing hard portions of the cabbage & not enough flavor. They have both traditional & unusual local brews on tap. The staff is friendly, accommodating and efficient. Though small, the dining space was comfortable & very clean. Plus there's a great, narrow porch facing Richmond Ave. should you want outdoor dining. It has small tables & a long wooden bar with many accompanying stools, behind which are set of cool windows granting views into where the magic happens, the pit room.
