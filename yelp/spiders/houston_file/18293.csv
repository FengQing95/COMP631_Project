Uchi////I had the highest expectations for this place, but honestly was a bit disappointed. The service was great. The presentations especially was rather mediocre and the food was ok. The portions were too small to call them tapas. The best thing we had was probably the pork belly and Brussels sprouts out of the 6 things we tried. Overrated.
