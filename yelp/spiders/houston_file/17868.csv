Uchi////I do have a more eclectic and adventurous palette, mind you, and I have yet to have drinks, vegetables or proteins that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. (If you love scallops, you must get the Buri - if avail, the Walu walu is very different and worth a try, and pork lovers must try the ham and eggs! Def peruse their daily specials...some of the best stuff is on that list!)
