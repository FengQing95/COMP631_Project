Uchi////Overall the food is great. If you have the patience to come here and wait, then i definitely recommend going. If you don't want to wait an hour for a table even with reservations, or another 30 minutes for food to be served in between courses, then wait a few months for the hype to die down and then head on over to Uchi.
