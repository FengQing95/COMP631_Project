JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is good ramen for people who aren't ramen freaks (like me). When I first started loving ramen, jinya was my favorite. I always get the spicy chicken ramen. One of the best things about jinya is there are SO many different ramen options. But the broth and ingredients really don't compare to authentic ramen...pretty americanized.
