Uchi////Our two cold plate starters were the Akami te and a gift of a similar dish with hamachi I believe. Both dishes' fish were very fishy and salty. It was hard to tell if it was cured or just not very good fish.. unpleasant nonetheless.. my favorite shag roll was not as lightly fried and thinly crisped as I enjoyed in Denver..
