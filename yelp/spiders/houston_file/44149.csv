Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Beat Salad - A beautiful presentation of colors. There were plenty of golden and red beats on the plate along with dollops of goat cheese, crispy bread crackers, and sliced grapefruit down the middle and all on top of arugula. Try all these ingredients in one bite, you'll have sweet, tart, and aromatic flavors in one bite. I really wish they gave us more arugula as we found ourselves finished the last bites of goat cheese and beats without the arugula touches.
