Baby Barnaby's////My wife and I finally had a day off together and decided that going out for breakfast would be a nice way to kick it off. I'd read good things about BBC so we came here this AM. Since other reviewers had warned us about long lines, we arrived promptly at 8:05. No wait, but the inside was already about full (warning: this place really is as small as others have stated - think 15' x 20' space). We found the one remaining booth and sat down. Â The inside is a fun mix of colors and it has a great cozy feeling. Very nice atmosphere for breakfast. Plus, the service was great.
