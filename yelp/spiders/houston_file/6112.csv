JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA is a chain with a few in Southern California and other states. Why does this place not exist in Northern California yet? Although this ramen place cannot compare to the likes of Daikokuya, which has a near and fond place to my heart, I find JINYA to serve a solid bowl of ramen for a picky individual like me. I went with a group of 6 at around 8:00 PM, so the wait was about "40 minutes", but really, it was closer to 25 minutes.
