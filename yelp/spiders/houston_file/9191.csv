JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Been only twice here, but omg the best ramen! I've had the spicy chicken ramen both times and it is amazing! I can't remember the appetizers we had but they were both delicious. The vibe was cool, dark, calm. The staff were friendly and attentive. Parking was not a problem.
