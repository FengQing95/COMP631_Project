The Pit Room////I'm from California and had never had real barbecue. How fortunate I was to stumble upon The Pit Room! The barbecue is top notch, and some of the tastiest food I have ever encountered. I like to get the brisket taco 'dry', without the sauce. The flavor is so scrumptious that it needs no sauce.
