Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Fantastic place for breakfast! The food is quality and they have a good variety of pancakes and other breakfast items. The line is usually long, so I recommend coming here during a weekday. I recommend ordering one of their pancake dishes. The restaurant is bright inside and retro looking!
