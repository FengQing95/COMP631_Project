Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Snooze has fantastic food! I would give them five stars based on food and because of horrible, rude customer service they get three stars. We went there this morning at 8:15am asking for a table for 2 and a high chair, the lady checking me in says 45 min wait. I say okay I'll order Togo. The lady checking people in next to me says 20 minutes for a table for 4, I ask the nice girl checking me in, she just said 20 minutes you said 45min? She said oh she is wrong. Okay, i say nothing and I order. At 9:15am one hour later my Togo food comes out. And when I get the order I say thank you and the girl who hands me the bag smirks and mumbles mmm hmmm. I walk out thinking I am a paying customer and I am thanking you for the food I waited one hour for that you told me would be 15 minutes and you should be thanking me for my business. Customer service really does make ALL the difference in the world. Hint, hint Snooze management.
