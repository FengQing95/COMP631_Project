JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Although it's a little pricey for a bowl of ramen, I thought the quick sitting, quick service, and amazing ambiance was more than worth the experience. My small group had only stayed long enough to finish the food we had, but our experience there was really nice and it felt like we stayed there for a really long time while catching up on each other's lives. Our visit didn't feel rushed, nor did it feel like they wanted to kick us out ASAP.
