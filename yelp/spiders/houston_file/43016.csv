Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've only been here once, but I already fell in love with Common Bond. I got the Chocolate Walnut Cookie and the Blue Berry Fritter. If they hadn't run out of the Kugelhopf and Pistachio Croissant, I'd get those too. Everything was so good! If you love bakeries, this is a must-try place. I'll be back to explore their brunch options and grab more bakeries.
