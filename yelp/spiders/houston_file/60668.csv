Baby Barnaby's////What really sealed the experience at the end was when one of the wait-staff 'suggested' to my friend and I (as we were chatting and I'm drinking coffee), that we should get up and make room so other hungry customers could eat.  This was so unexpected and off-putting.  I mean, we did wait forever after all, can't I at least finish my coffee???  What was more irritating about this comment, was that as we politely left, I noticed a large group of 5-6, who were seated before us, still sitting and enjoying their brunch.
