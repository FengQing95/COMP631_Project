Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Ordered by calling in a togo order and got the tomato basil soup (hearty & flavorful), CHARCUTERIE BAGUETTE (delicious bread and yummy deli meats/veggies) and the trio macaroons). 2nd order tomato basil soup, Texas club sandwich (toasted bread and yummy deli meats) and the turtle brownie (very rich). They had a designated parking spot for togo/pick ups in the front of the restaurant. And you just call them when you arrive. You can pay ahead through the phone or in person. Would come back for sure for a simple brunch/lunch!
