Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is by no means a cheap alternative - a couple pastries here can easily cost you $20 bucks. However, given 1) the excellent execution of appearance/decoration 2) the interesting flavors/combinations 3) stellar atmosphere I believe they're worth the money.
