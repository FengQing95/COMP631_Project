The Pit Room////We were able to get in and through the line quickly. I ordered the two meat plate (lean sliced beef and beef sausage), which came with two sides ( I got the charro beans and barbecued string/green beans, which were not on the menu, but were on the serving line). The cost was $15.75, which seems like par for the course. The sliced beef cuts were amazing! They were perfectly lean, had a great smokey taste, had just the right amount of bark, and I cut through it like a knife through butter. The sausage took me back to when Green's Barbecue was open, 3rd Ward. The kinds of sausage that was moist and somewhat crumbles when you bite into it and the skin doesn't get stuck hanging out of your mouth. The seasoning was exceptional, with the flavorful barbecue sauce adding to the parade of flavors happening on my taste buds. The charro beans were great, too, and had a little kick to them. The green beans were sauteed with onions and they had a nice smokey, barbecue flavor. I've never had anything like that before and I definitely want more!
