Kata Robata////Came here for an anniversary dinner. Decided to show up without a reservation and got pretty lucky. Albeit a bit pricey, the food was delicious! We had their appetizers, sushi, and dessert and everything tasted pretty good. We wanted to try the Ramen because we heard good things, but we didn't get to try it. Maybe next time. The sushi was fresh and well presented. We didn't get any drinks, since we opted for more food.
