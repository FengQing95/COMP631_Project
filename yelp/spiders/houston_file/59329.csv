Baby Barnaby's////Amazing (and cheap) breakfast dishes and combos, tasty coffee while you wait, and your choice of the cozy diner or the relaxed patio.  I'm here at least twice a month for a lazy weekend morning.  Fresh juice, great service...no complaints at all.  Ever.  Do expect to wait, though, and make sure you put your name on the clipboard outside (yes, you have to do it yourself. Don't complain at the waiter that you didn't know what to do.  He's too nice for that.)
