JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////That said, the four stars is because the ramen here is for the most part quite good. I think the quality can be variable, but on the whole, this is some of the tastier ramen in Houston. Tonkotsu broth is thick and hearty. Chicken ramen is a lighter option, but still so flavorful. My go-to is the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu, but the spice level is anyone's guess depending on the day. I've had it blazing and I've had it completely mild - but always quite tasty. Noodles are toothsome. Extras can be added to your soup for small a la carte fees (seasoned egg and butter are musts in my book).
