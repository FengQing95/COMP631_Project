The Pit Room////We had the $120 family order #2.  First time in Texas and what a great Texas BBQ meal. All meat was very tender, smoky but not too overpoweringly smoked. Coffee bourbon sauce was sweet with a nice kick, the mild hot sauce had a good "medium" kick. A nice texMEX addition.  My teenage sons dunked  their bread in it! We all appreciated the house BBQ- absolutely perfect spice profile. We all had our favorite- mine was the turkey, one son the jalapeño sausage, another the chopped pork. Daughter preferred the brisket. Everything delicious. 6 of us had enough leftovers for a light lunch today.  Very friendly staff and a very clean restaurant indoor or out.
