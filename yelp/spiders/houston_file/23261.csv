Uchi////The negative: the hostess at the door (brunette wearing a qipao) was uber pretentious. We made reservations and came on time, but when we got there at 5:30 p.m., we saw a bunch of ppl already standing in line out the door, blocking the entrance. So my husband asked her if we still have to stand in line when we have a reservation, and she snootily said "everyone has to stand in line," and basically rolled her eyes at us. What's the point of making a reservation if we had to wait in a long line like everyone else? We're from SoCal, and even the most exclusive restaurants in LA don't have as much attitude as she did.
