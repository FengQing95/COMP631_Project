Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I can't comment on the quality of either the food or the coffee here, but their bakeries/desserts are some of the best I've had, period.  Of which, the two that are most noteworthy are the Walnut Chocolate Chip Cookie and the Pain au Chocolat (chocolate croissants, for the non-Francais speakers).  Both are quite polar opposites in taste and composition. The cookies are small (about the size of an above-average fist), have a perfectly-crisped outside, and pack a heavy duty 1-2 walnut-chocolate chunk punch, while the croissants are as big as your face, fluffy and airy, and much more chocolate-conservative--but both deliver the goods in their own unique way.  I'd actually recommend getting both if you're looking to splurge on a cheat meal or in need of a quick indulgence. The law of opposite attraction applies here, as both complement each other really well.
