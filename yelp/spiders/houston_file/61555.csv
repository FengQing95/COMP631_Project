Baby Barnaby's////Food is great. Recommend to their management that they get a sign directing people to sign in. The clipboard to reserve a space is not easy to find and people constantly walk through the eating area, confused as to where they need to go. Staff ends up spending time directing people and being interrupted while doing their work.
