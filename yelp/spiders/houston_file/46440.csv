Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Great place to check out for brunch. This Common Bond location has much more space and many more pastries to try than the other location. You'll walk in and immediately have your eyes drawn to the pastries on display. The kouign aman is delicious with sticky sweet caramelized flaky pastry. Delicious.
