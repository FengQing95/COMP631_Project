Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////This place is extremely picturesque, and the vibe is cool. Service was fast, knowledgeable and friendly. We went for Sunday brunch, and there was good live music. The bosscat fries were thick steak fries which had a homemade sauce - but werent particularly special. The meatloaf hash was delicious, moist, and flavorful, and the best part of the meal. We were warned by our server that the king pancakes were really sweet -- but we made the mistake of not listening since I have a huge sweet tooth. Unfortunately, the item that is so beautiful and caught our eye in the first place, had way too many flavors going on. It wasn't necessarily too sweet, but it was something to skip entirely. I still would like to try the place for dinner because the menu stilled sounded impressive even if brunch was okay.
