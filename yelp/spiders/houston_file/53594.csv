Kata Robata////With lots of hype from the Houston Press and here on Yelp, I tried out Kata Robata for lunch one afternoon and was largely left un-disappointed.  In typical Houston fashion, it's located in a strip center, but the decor inside is sleek and modern without being trendy-ridiculous.  There appears to be a patio out back, but it was buttoned up and closed for lunch.  I was seated at the sushi bar and looked through the menu--if you're looking to experience Kata Robata without breaking the bank, definitely go for your midday meal.  There's a lunch special available which includes a salad, 6pc California roll and three pieces of nigiri for a whopping $9.
