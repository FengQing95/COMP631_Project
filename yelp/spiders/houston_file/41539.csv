Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I had a crazy macaroon craving, and really really wanted one stat.  After seeing endless check ins at Common Bond, and reading about the hype, I decided to go check it out on Sunday.  In the afternoon there was a line, but it seemed to move fairly quick.  The place was packed with curious hipsters, Montrose locals, and people getting their own carb and sugar rush.
