Uchi////FOOD SELECTION - Mostly being "tapas style"  The menu can be alittle overwhelming (the service staff helps alittle) so we decided to choose the 6 course chefs tasting menu ( $91) there was a 10 course option for ( $192) - that math just didn't add up to me... you could have 2 -  6 course tastings cheaper than 1 - 10 course tasting!!!  ANYWHO... the variety on our tasting was Mehhhhh..... not a variety! 3 out of 6 of the courses were  - yellow tail - weather it was the sashimi, sushi of their version of the fried rice!?!? out of 6 courses we only received one HOT - and out of the 6 3 of them - the main sauce being yuzu - not too balanced - and that hot dish was a pan seared escolar (one of my favorite fish) OVER COOKED to the point to was difficult to eat  the dessert was one we could choose ( that was nice ) it was the fried milk - i enjoyed that one!
