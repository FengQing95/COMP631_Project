JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I was having massive ramen withdrawals since I've been back from my short trip to Japan and Jinya did a fantastic job satiating my needs. I was already prepared to be disappointed since I've been to Jinya several times in the past and have never really been WOW'ed with their old menu. But I see they have been doing a little tweaking. From the top of my head, in the past I've tried the Tsukemen dipping ramen (discontinued), their Spicy Miso ramen, their Tonkotsu Black twice, and the spicy chicken ramen. My last visit is the most memorable one yet.
