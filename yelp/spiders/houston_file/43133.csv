Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////My son and I love catching up at Common Bond when he comes to visit as the food is fresh, super tasty, healthy, and reasonably priced. Their chocolate chip cookie is probably the best in Montrose if not Houston, and plus it is super cute and comfortable. I can't wait til he is here on his next trip back home so we can try the brunch!
