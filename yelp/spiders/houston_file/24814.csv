Uchi////For dessert we had the Fried Milk- Vanilla custard, Chocolate fudge, and Toasted Blondie. I use to not care for it, but my love for it grew, lol. It is a must for anyone that visits Uchi. Chef also gifted us with their special dessert as a birthday gift: Apple Okashi- Roased Oats, Caramen Mousse, and Brown Butter. It was different and good, but Fried Milk trumps it all.
