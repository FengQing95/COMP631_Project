Uchi////The wait was shorter than 30 minutes. We just decided to sit and eat in the bar which was perfectly fine for us. We were greeted by the sweetest server ever. He was kind and he definitely took care of our needs. Their sushi were amazing! That's what I called "authentic"! I never tried grilled edamame before and I must say, it was a delish!
