Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I only get their kouign-amann and almond chocolate croissant. They used to have this orange blossom  scone which I dream about, but alas, the few times I stopped by, they don't carry it. I've tried their breakfast and lunch items which are unique and up scaled food, but not as satisfying as their pastries.  I'm glad I live  20 minutes from this place or else I'd stop by every morning for their pastries with my coffee.
