Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The egg sandwich is pretty hyped up, and albeit good, but you come for the pastries. The pastries are incredible and there's some items that cycle through while others stay on the menu. The oatmeal cream pie is good, but I would pass it up for some of the other baked goods.
