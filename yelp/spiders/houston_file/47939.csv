Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food and service here is great but I wouldn't say there was anything that I couldn't whip up at home. Loved the bottomless coffee and the drink menu looked awesome (we didn't get to try because it was early on a Sunday). If I were to brave those lines again, it would probably be for friends and the atmosphere.
