Kata Robata////Came here for happy hour on a weekday. The place is cute and cozy. It wasn't too busy, so we didn't have to wait in line, but from what I've heard, there's usually a long line for this place and you usually have to make reservations in advance to eat here for dinner. We sat at the sushi bar, which is always fun. There's also a cute little garden patio with AC in the back of the restaurant.
