JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Alice - Thank you for your review. In the interest of constructive feedback, are you able to expound on why you felt our noodles were "not that good," as you describe? We always want to know how we can improve, and specific details such as texture, thickness, or cook time will always prove useful to us. Also, could you also tell me what else you ordered, and how our food failed to meet your standards?
