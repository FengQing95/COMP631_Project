Kata Robata////I came on a Saturday evening with my boyfriend for a special occasion, so we came prepared to shell out some $$ for this (which for us means 50-60 dollars per person haha we are broke college students). I was expecting to be wowed since I've heard unbelievable things about this place, but I was only halfway wowed, to be honest. It's definitely impressive and I think there's a lot more to try that we weren't able to get to, but I think unfortunately, due to the need for imports, freshness inevitably varies based on when you visit.
