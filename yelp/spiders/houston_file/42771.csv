Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is yet ANOTHER hot new place that I've been dying to go to and let me tell you, the hype that I built around it was definitely worth it!  Rather then trying to fight the breakfast/brunch crowd I came around 2pm on a Sunday.  This only worked in my favor in that I didnt have to wait in a line out the door, but worked against me in that many of their pastries were SOLD OUT! Which honestly, I didn't mind because to me that says they are making their food fresh and once they're out, they're out... no left over stale croissants for them.
