Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////As I stood there, more cars kept on filing in and parked. The closer it got to 9 AM, the more cars rolled in. I was feeling a little incredulous. FINALLY - we were let in... only to get in line indoors. A good thing; the day's forecast had rain on the menu. The line was slow-going though, since the people behind the counter would get to a customer and take their orders one by one. Some people were ordering to-go... boxes full.
