Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I had brunch today with a large group of friends and it was so much fun !! The food, AMAZING. Our server, AMAZING. The restaurant, AMAZING. I ordered the salmon and vegetable hash and wow it had so much flavor, seasoned so well. Our server Jackie was so warm and willing to accommodate. Overall, such a good experience. I will definitely be returning again soon. 10/10 would recommend.
