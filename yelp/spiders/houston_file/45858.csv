Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The plain bread was good with its softness but slightly salty and sweet taste. You can ask for butter and jam to go along with it. The kouign aman was super delicious with its cameral covering at the base (or top?) of the bread. After the first bite, I couldn't stop. The almond croissant was on point too and helped bring my sugar level to its happiness level.
