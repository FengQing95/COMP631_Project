Kata Robata////Awesome food and service. I've been here a lot due to its convenient location. Food can be salty sometimes, but is excellent compared to other restaurants. Ribs are extremely tender and chirashi bowl is very very fresh. Not a big fan of lobster noodles but my friends like it. Very fanatic about green tea cake!
