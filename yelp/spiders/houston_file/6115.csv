JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is the mother of all ramen! I've never been a fan of ramen but was convinced to go during lunch with some coworkers that raved about this place. I'm so glad I did because the food is bomb! I always get the Jinya Chicken ramen and add the spice in myself. I'm sensitive to spicy foods but from what my husband and friends say, they aren't kidding around with the spice. It will clear out your sinuses apparently. The chicken is lean which is hard to find in a ramen place. Everything I have had is good. My faves, other than the ramen, are the Jinya Quinoa Salad, Gyoza, Brussel Sprouts, Edamame, and Spicy Tuna Tacos
