The Pit Room////Hola my Yelp compadres, Â This will be a short but sweet entry. My husband and I was invited to go with a few family members to get some good bbq. We both ordered the 3 meet tray beef rib, pork rib, brisket and sausage with Mac and Cheese, green beans, mustard potato salad. The meats were tender and had the right amount of smoke, but the meat was very bland meaning no flavor(no salt and no pepper). The side were bland at well except for the green beans. Sorry, to disappoint you my friends. No 2nd chances!
