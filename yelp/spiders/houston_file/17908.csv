Uchi////We also went in on a Saturday evening at 8:30pm with no reservation, and we were seated pretty quickly for a table of 5, so try your luck. Hopefully you'll wind up at the sushi bar which is my favorite spot to be so you can chat with the sushi chef, but a table is fine as well. This is in my top 5 places in Houston...or actually maybe even the world....
