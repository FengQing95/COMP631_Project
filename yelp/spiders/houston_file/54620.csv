Kata Robata////Overall, wonderful experience. I came for Valentine's Day and they offered my date a free red rose as a topper. At the end of the meal, they offered a sinfully delicious piece of chocolate truffle. Rich, beautiful and melts in your mouth. Wonderful place. Wine and dine her for $200 with extremely fresh and tasty sushi!
