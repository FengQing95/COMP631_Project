Uchi////Wow. I've been wanting to go here for some time, and I have to say I was not disappointed. For me, a Michelin star restaurant has to be hitting on all cylinders in three areas : food, service, and decor. And Uchi does very well in all three, plus a fourth - creativity and playfulness. You are encouraged to have fun with your food and play with it. It is such a change and so unique, I was just amazed. I have never been someplace quite like it. It is really a shame that Michelin does not award stars (yet) in Houston, because they would certainly deserve at least one. And as far as the price goes - yes it is not cheap, but frankly I was surprised that it didn't cost more. I have paid the same or more for a crummy experience.
