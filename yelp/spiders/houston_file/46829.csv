Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food here is quite amazing- got the pancake flight on the 4th of July, which came with a special holiday pancake. Despite how crowded it was, the service is absolutely amazing- quick and efficient. I gave it 4 stars just because of the wait (about an hour despite our early arrival).
