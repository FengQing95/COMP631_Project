JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////So, visiting this spot was the one and only time I've ever had ramen (the real stuff, not the broke college student variety), and it was fantastic.  I had the spicy chicken ramen and it really hit the spot.  I really liked the customization options of adding things such as seasoned egg, garlic, butter, other veggies, etc.  I'll be going back.  Just gonna have to find a time when it isn't so dang busy because it is always packed!!
