Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////If you love pancakes this is the place for you. The cinnamon roll pancake is perfect on its own, no syrup needed.Everything else is ok. My sister loved the breakfast tacos but they arn't really a traditional breakfast taco so I just enjoyed my pancake service this time was great! But sometimes it is a little off. They also have great gluten free options for the pancakes
