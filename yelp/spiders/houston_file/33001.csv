Local Foods////Got the Asian salad and the jalapeño hummus. The hummus is amazing and I could buy it by the boatloads. It's unique and Delish. The Asian salad however is average and was nothing special.  It has large pieces of interesting tasting mango which was the highlight of the salad but I would try something different if I go back.
