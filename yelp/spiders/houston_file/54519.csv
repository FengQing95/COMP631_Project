Kata Robata////The hostesses, on the other hand, need to be reminded that the customer should be respected. God forbid I ask for a booth instead of a table at 5 PM when NO ONE else is there. I am greeted with huffs and puffs every time. Last time I was there I even heard the hostess mumble, "seriously?" under her breath when I requested a booth.
