Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Nice ambiance! We tried to come on a Sunday midday and it was packed and had to leave. We tried it today (Monday) and it wasn't too crowded. Staff friendly and helpful! My 9 year old daughter suggested that we let you know that she didn't like the Kugelhoph and asked to reduce the rating to four stars! :)
