Kata Robata////It is over, Kata Robata. Although it could have been close. K.R. has a solid interior, good ambiance. You wouldn't know, but I literally just spent 15 minutes navigating the website to pin down what we ate. Tropical spicy tuna, salmon/soft shell crab roll, and I remember this because it wasn't on the menu, some special ramen of the day that had a xx degree egg in it...
