Kata Robata////However, it's so pricey that my family and I only go there for special occasions or when they have the Houston Restaurant Weeks (an amazing event to try out expensive restaurants like this one). I can't speak about anything else on their menu because I always order the Kobe beef, obviously. But I highly recommend this place, I can't wait to go back.
