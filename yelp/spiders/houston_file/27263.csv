The Pit Room////I've tried a lot of BBQ in Texas. I've done Lockhart a dozen times. I've done killens, Gatlins and roegels in Houston. I really enjoy good BBQ. This was ok. Pit room is really like a craft beer. There are some you don't like. The thing is, your buddy may love it. I wasn't a big fan. Pit room has a lot of intense flavors. I like more central Texas style.  meat with smoke, salt and pepper.  This place seems focused on putting a lot on flavors imparted into and with the meat. It's not my thing.
