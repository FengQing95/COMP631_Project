The Pit Room////I'm so mad at myself for not getting any pictures. It's likely because it was such a random stop and didn't intend to get lunch here BUT I'm so glad I did. It was early afternoon midweek and wasn't crowded but there were definitely enough people grabbing lunch to let me know the reviews must be accurate.
