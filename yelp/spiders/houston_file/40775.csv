Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I was there this past Friday night (3/11) celebrating my friend's birthday, along with her daughter at 730pm. I had called earlier in the day to request a fun, purple fizzy cocktail come out to the 3 of us after we were sat. This did not happen even though the person I spoke to identified a cocktail that fit the bill. I thanked her and hung up. We arrived, were sat, and server immediately asked for our drink order. I went up to the hostess stand which we were  seated in very close proximity, our table was 3ft away. A young lady identified herself as the one who spoke to me earlier that afternoon and said something along the lines of "oh I don't think you understood over the phone that we couldn't take your request". I was irritated b/c she said NOTHING to that effect over the phone and after asking why, I  thought better of it and asked WELL CAN YOU DO IT NOW? She confirmed she could and asked, where our table was located, I pointed to our table and thanked her. Nothing ever came of my drink request. The whole point of my call/request was to have sonething fun and unexpected come out right away to set the tone of the evening (that I was obviously going to pay for).  The server continued on as if he was not aware or spoken to by the girl or any of the hostesses about my request. I was not nor am I now asking for anything free. Our server was lovely and the food was excellent. But why give me an expectation that a prior, simple, paid for birthday request could be achieved? The girl immediately ignored my requests and when given a chance to remedy the situation, again completely ignored it. I was extremely annoyed that something so simple was ignored by whoever this girl was and also by hostess staff present standing there listening to my request. It was busy, but definitely not packed. Our table as I mentioned was located right by the hostess stand.  If they had somehow forgotten, anyone could have glanced over and served as a reminder of my request.
