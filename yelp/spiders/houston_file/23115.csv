Uchi////I've been wanting to go to Uchi for the longest time and my boyfriend took me out to eat there tonight to celebrate my late birthday as well as our anniversary. Our server was Savannah and I was very pleased with the service. The staff was very professional and friendly. They were aware that we were celebrating my birthday/our anniversary, so each server who brought us our dish congratulated us as well as explained what each dish was. I especially liked the white guy with the beard, he was really funny. It gave a very friendly vibe, which I really enjoyed. It just made our experience all the better.
