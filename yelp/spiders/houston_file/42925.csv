Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////You are probably wondering why I did not give them 5 stars out of 5 as I am saying they are the best bakery in Houston, well the reason is two-fold.  The first is that their staff is far too pretentious.  I know this is a nice place, but friendliness go a long way, especially when you have wait in line for 10 minutes.  The second reason is the price point.  The last time I was in, I purchased 6 pastries and the total was close to $30, which in my opinion is steep.  Saying this though, it is worth the money every once and a while for a special occasion.  I recommend this place to anyone who visits Montrose.
