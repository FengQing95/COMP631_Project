Local Foods////I've loved Local Foods since they opened but I'm here for a late lunch and have had a great experience. I'm 9 months pregnant and really wanted their bahn mi- but it has aioli... which usually has raw egg. 9 times out of 10 if I'm at a restaurant and ask if a dish has raw egg the person helping me has to ask the kitchen. When I asked the woman at the counter if it had raw egg she answered without skipping a beat "yes, but we used pasteurized eggs". Music to this preggo's ears. I was so impressed she knew not only that raw egg was in it but that it was pasteurized- or even to follow up with that. Side rant- there are a significant number of pregnant women (and people on chemo or with other health issues) who eat at restaurants. It's so annoying when staff don't know if soft cheeses are pasteurized or if there is raw egg in something....
