Uchi////Rolls here are nothing too special, but the ones on the Sake Social menu are a pretty great deal, and are good to fill you up. The "ham and eggs", a pork belly roll served with a mustard dipping sauce, off of the standard menu is a little pricey, but a pretty unique and delicious roll worth trying at least once. I also got to sample both the dayboat scallop and foie gras nigiri; both were some of the most delicious bites of the entire dinner. Though nigiri here are a tad small, splurging for the foie piece is definitely worth it if you can afford it.
