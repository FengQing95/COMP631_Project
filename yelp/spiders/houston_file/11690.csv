JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Onto the food - my staple is the tonkotsu spicy. I love the broth but my only gripe is that I wish there were more toppings in it without having to spend more then 15 dollars to have a decent bowl with more variety. Tip: get some butter on the side - it makes your broth sooo silky. Other bowls that I've really liked: Tonkotsu Black, Cha-Cha-Cha, and Sprouting Up Ramen.
