Baby Barnaby's////Probably one of my new favorite brunch spots in Houston! Came here with my husband and a friend around 10am on a Saturday morning. The wait wasn't too bad, we probably only waited about 20 minutes until we were seated. Their menu is a bit small, but in my opinion succinct. Their Green Eggs (Two eggs scrambled with spinach, artichoke hearts & jack cheese, served with chicken apple sausage, potatoes & wheat toast, but I actually substituted the wheat toast for their delicious biscuits!) clearly stood out on the menu and was also highly recommended by our waitress. My friend ordered the exact same dish and we both could not have been any happier. The eggs were absolutely delicious and cooked SO WELL. They were so savory, creamy and fluffy! The biscuits were so nice and warm, and buttery and it had honey in the middle! What a lovely surprise. HEAVEN IN A BISCUIT. Everything overall was just so delectable! My husband ordered the Migas (Corn tortilla strips, green chilies, onions, tomatoes & cheese, scrambled with 3 eggs, served with salsa & potatoes w/ chorizo ($2 extra)) and it was also very delicious. But I loved The Green Eggs dish so much more. If you're stuck and not sure what to order, I highly highly recommend you try the Green Eggs and substitute the wheat toast with their heavenly biscuits! Service was excellent. Everyone here is friendly and helpful. Looking forward to coming back and ordering Green Eggs again!
