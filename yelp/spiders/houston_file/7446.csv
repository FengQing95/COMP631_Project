JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Thank you for your Yelp Review.  I'm sorry to hear you did not like the ramen you ordered.  This is reason why we carry over 13 different kinds of ramen on the menu.  Some people like their ramen thick and rich while others like it simple and light.  I wished you would have sent back your Cha, Cha, Cha and we would have gladly made you a different bowl of ramen for you to try.  We do that all the time for our guests as since many of our guests don't know what to expect from their first bowl.  My motto is "If it's not GREAT, REMAKE".   Although we're not going to be all things to all people, we do appreciate you coming in and trying us out.  Should you ever return, please feel free to ask for any one of my managers:  Keith, Wynne and Kathy.  They will give you some great suggestions of what types of ramen will be suitable to your palate.
