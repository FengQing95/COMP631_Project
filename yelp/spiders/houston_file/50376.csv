Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Service was slow and by this point there was hardly anyone dining. It was an all afternoon affair snooze. We get there at 1 and we didn't leave until 4. I can think of a million other wonderful ways to spend my Sunday afternoon. Was the food worth it? YES, but NOT for the amount of time we spent there. I would absolutely suggest you going on a week day. Thank you Leah for saving the day.
