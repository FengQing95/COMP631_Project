Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I have yet to have a pastry here that I don't like. The cortado, despite using Boomtown coffee (which I really like) did not turn out that well unfortunately. It would have paired very well with the different pastries. It lacked any presentation, and the ratio of milk to coffee wasn't very good, making the drink a bit bland. The coffee itself also seemed a bit too dark somehow. Overall, I haven't been to another pastry shop in Houston that I like more than this place, but I wouldn't come just for coffee. They also have a lot of different food items on the menu, which I have yet to have but they always look delicious.
