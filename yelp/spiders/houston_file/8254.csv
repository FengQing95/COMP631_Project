JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya is the best one I've tried yet.  The pork broth is rich, but not creamy, and savory with enough sweetness to give you the Asian taste balance.  I loved the texture of the large noodles.  They're chewy and absorb the broth flavor so well.  They're the kind that make you continue to shovel them into your face without talking to the rest of the table.
