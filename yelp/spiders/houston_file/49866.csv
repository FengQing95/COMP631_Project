Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Walking into this place I thought to myself "ok, yeah, I get what the hype is about." We arrived at 1:15 pm and the wait time for a table of two was 2 hours. So after waiting for 15 minutes we were able to find 2 seats at the bar together. I ordered 2 bloody Mary's which were okay- no olives or celery, very bare bones, but that was fine. My husband grabbed a cup of the house coffee which he thought was good. Once we sat at the bar we ordered promptly. Our waitress/bartender then told us our ticket was lost and she wasn't sure if it was her fault or the kitchen's fault. She wrote down our order again. All in, we waited close to an hour for our food while we saw multiples parties get seated after us & receive their food before us.
