Uchi////Just tried this place for the first time. It definitely lives up to the hype. This place is awesome. I started off with the shag roll, which is awesome. It is a fried roll and it is probably second only to the next one I ordered which was their famous ham and eggs roll. This one had fried pork Katsu in it. It is the only sushi of it's kind that I've had. It is definitely the most recommended roll.  The last roll I tried was the spicy tuna roll. This one is very good, but I think the other two were better.  Now onto the next dishes. I got Brussels sprouts and karaage. The Brussels sprouts are the best thing on the menu. They are bursting with flavor and I've never tasted any that were so good! The karaage was great too. Fried perfectly.  Finally, the dessert. Get the fried milk and the peanut butter semifreddo. The first is milk and cookies. The second is peanut butter and jelly. It's awesome. I love this place. Everyone in Houston has to try this place. It's awesome.
