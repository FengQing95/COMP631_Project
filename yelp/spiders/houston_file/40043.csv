Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We are in town for the Miss Texas Teen USA pageant and was staying in the area and decided to try something new. I looked at eateries in the area and based on the yelp rating we decided to get Bosscat Kitchen a try. When we arrived we were seated immediately and shortly greeted by our waitress. We ordered the cornbread madeleines. They arrived to the table shortly thereafter. They had good flavor but it would have preferred them to be warm. My husband and I ordered the Bosscat Burger with a side a fries to share. The Bosscat Burger was amazing! The only issue we had was our waitress didn't bring our fries and we had to ask for them. But they made it right by taking care of the fries.
