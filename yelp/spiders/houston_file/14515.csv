JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Regarding some of your points, I would like to apologize that our menu does not list "half-seasoned egg" as it should. We are hoping to remedy this for future printings of our menu. To that end, some of our bowls do contain half an egg because our corporate JINYA headquarters long ago devised the recipes based not only on flavor, but also the particular costs of ingredients and the price points they were targeting for each bowl of ramen. Keep in mind, as one of many franchises around the country, we are serving thousands of bowls of ramen each day, and a full egg versus half egg must be measured in these terms.
