Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They had quite a lot of menu items than I expected but I went with the Nashville Hot and when I say Hot, I mean HOT. Sheesh. It was a pretty big sandwich. It was good but it was a bit more spicy than I would've liked but it had cole slaw in the sandwich so it kind of toned it down a tad. I wouldn't get it again though if we're being honest.
