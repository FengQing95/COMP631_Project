Kata Robata////This place USED to be our favorite sushi restaurant.  We hadn't been to Kata Robata in a while, but decided to treat ourselves and left very disappointed.  They significantly reduced their sushi roll portion sizes and their prices have stayed the same.  For $18/roll we were expecting to receive better than average size portions like they used to serve, but instead they are so small you have to order at least 2 rolls if you want to share with another person.  And don't bother going to Azuma, they've done the same thing.  If you value your dollar, don't go here.  I'll be sure to go to the plenty of other sushi places in the area next time.
