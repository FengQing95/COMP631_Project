The Pit Room////My family also hosted a couple's shower here for our family friends. We took over the space that used to be Jackson's Watering Hole but is now owned by the Pit Room group and used for private events.  The whole thing went without a hitch. The bartenders and other servers were helpful, and the event was so much fun.  The food, of course, stole the show.
