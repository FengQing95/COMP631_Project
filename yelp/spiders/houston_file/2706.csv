JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Tried this place for the first time last night after 2 previous attempts where the wait was wayyy too long and we had other plans to make, but given its reputation we kept trying to come back. :) Atmosphere and service was fantastic, our waitress was wonderful. The ramen itself was awesome and FULL of flavor... It literally inspired me to write a bad review of the last ramen restaurant we tried. Â I will definitely be coming back as many times as it takes to try every bowl on the menu.
