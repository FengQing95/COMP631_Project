Uchi////This was an exceptional dining experience all around! Food, drinks, sushi chefs and wait staff were all wonderful! We went during happy hour so needless say....the bill was actually a pleasant surprise. I've been to the Dallas location and while it too was fabulous, Houston just had an overall better atmosphere. My dining companion and I sat at the sushi bar which was fine. We had a sushi chef assigned to us (basically you order food/sushi through Â him and he prepares the order-at least that's what was implied). Unbeknown to me, our sushi chef was more like a chef in training since every order had to be prepared by the real chefs which were conveniently located to the left and the right of him. Still didn't phase me because the sushi was still fresh, adventuresome and an absolute delight! Ordered basically everything on the happy hour menu including a Pitch Fork roll and the Foie Nigiri. The Pitch Fork was great but I can't recommend the foie nigiri....however my dinner companion loved it. I can't say enough about the Fried Milk dessert except that I'm lactose intolerant but still loved and finished the dessert with full understanding of the ramifications! Highly recommend this place and please do sit at the sushi bar!
