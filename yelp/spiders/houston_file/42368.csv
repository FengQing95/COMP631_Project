Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I went there for breakfast on a weekday since I heard the weekend lines are quite long. We ordered the bread plate and three different types of croissants (plain, almond and a banana/hazelnut). The croissants were crispy and flaky but not my favorite. The plain one was the winner. The bread plate is a must- it is served with a regular butter, a seasonal butter and two jams. It is a great way to sample some of their fresh breads. The hot chocolate and cappuccino we ordered were great. I would like to go back to try their lunch and brunch. The servers highly recommend brunch. FYI they do not take reservations.
