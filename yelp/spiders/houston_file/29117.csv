The Pit Room////My first visit was last Saturday for lunch. I pulled up and found a parking spot out front on Richmond. Walking in, I noticed this is a rather small restaurant inside that also has some outside seating. Walking up to the counter, I ordered the 1/2 chicken for $8 and added the charro beans and mustard based potato salad as sides with a soft drink. Moving down the short line, I paid over $18 for this meal which is very expensive. My chicken was very good. It was smokey in flavor and the meat moist (4). I also enjoyed the potato salad with its chunky texture and mustard twangy taste (3.5). The charro beans were a disappointment. They looked great with brisket meat in them but the taste just wasn't for me. The bean sauce was too strong for me. Too hot taste wise which is just like their BBQ sauce. If you like a strong and hot BBQ taste then maybe you will like this sauce. I didn't (2).
