JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA has the best Ramen in town! I come here when ever I get the craving for authentic ramen. You are greeted as soon as you walk in by the lovely hostesses and are usually seated immediately. There are booths, tables, and community style seating. You can order ANYTHING off the menu and you will not be disappointed. Everything is delicious, I recommend the spicy chicken ramen. The prices are very reasonable and you can leave with a full belly for around $20. My favorite waiter is Daniel. He is funny, makes good recommendations, and really loves his job. Be sure to ask for him when you visit.
