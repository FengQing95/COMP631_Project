JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Heather - Thank you so much for the stars. My general manager Keith lived in New York for more than a decade, so he always takes pride in hearing from other New Yorkers who say our ramen is "bona fide." I can also say that you are correct -- everyone inside JINYA works hard. There's really no other way we could operate otherwise. Some days are better than others, and when we stumble we do our best to make amends, dust ourselves off and get back up and keep moving forward. So when I read a review like yours, it feels good to know our effort is being noticed. Thank you again, and we look forward to serving you in the future.
