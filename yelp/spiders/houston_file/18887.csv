Uchi////This place is why I now eat Brussels sprouts.  I always thought they were gross (though I admit I don't remember ever actually eating them) but after tasting the appetizer here I will forever be a sprout eater.  I dream about them...so good.  I suggest getting them even if you think you don't like them.
