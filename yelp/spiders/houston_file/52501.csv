Kata Robata////Very impressive place here, I had to add in my own review.  I think some of the lower reviews have gotten a skewed perspective of "sushi" and Japanese cuisine from places like Sushi King and Kaneyama.  These places try to fool you into thinking they are authentic and I guess they've succeeded with some of you people.
