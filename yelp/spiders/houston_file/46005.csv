Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////CB's pastries are so beautiful! They are very rich and decadent, so they pair well with their coffee (which is also delicious). I always get birthday or celebration treats from here and everyone has loved them. Inside has a great vibe too and it is a nice place to read or do a little work too.
