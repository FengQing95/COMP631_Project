Baby Barnaby's////Even though I live in Austin, I try to visit Baby Barnaby's whenever I am in town on the weekends!  If I could give a greater-than-five-stars rating, I would.  This quaint location is often bustling with activity during weekend brunch.  Parking is never too bad for us, as there are spots within walking distance in the surrounding blocks.  Know in advance that because this place is popular (and delicious!), you may have to wait for your table ... and this DOES mean waiting outside; however, they have umbrellas, a big fan, and free water that you can partake in while you wait.  Despite the summer heat, I simply can't reduce the rating for this ... it is always worth it once we get inside. :)  When signing in on the list upon arrival, you can opt to sit outside if you do not wish to wait for an inside slot.
