Uchi////As far as dinner goes, both times we averaged at about $100 a person for food and wine, and yes, enough food for me to walk away stuffed! I think it all boils down to either A) knowing the menu and what to order or B) Having complete faith in your server to lead you into a cohesive, multi-course meal that'll cater to your cravings - whether you knew you had one or not. For social hour (4:30-6pm), you'll spend half the amount of money, so for those complaining about the price, there's a special 1.5 hours just for you!
