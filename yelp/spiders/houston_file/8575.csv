JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This ramen not only made me question all bowls of ramen I've had previously, but my existence as well. I don't remember what exactly it was called but it's the third item on the right side and it's the black ramen. It has pork and it's so so good. I hope we get one of these in my hometown some time because I know for sure it'll be a top restaurant there if that ever happens
