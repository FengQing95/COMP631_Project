Local Foods////I visit here every time I'm in Houston. THE BEST SALADS!!! You can make any one of their sandwiches into a salad. Their sides are unique and top notch. Can't say enough great things about this place. Its getting popular but the staff works thru the lines well getting food out the customers promptly.
