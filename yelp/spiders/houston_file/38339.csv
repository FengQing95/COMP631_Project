Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Old fashion / industrial furniture and ambiance, super clean. Came there for a burger on a saturday at 2pm, wasnt too busy, got seated right away. Specialized on whiskey more than 300... we got the chicken flatbread really good with caramelized onion and tomatoe, the burger was one of the best we ever had, meat was cooked really well and the bread was fantastic ;) the french fries are huge.
