Uchi////Love this place! Haha, this one time our sushi chef misheard that we came back to Houston for a wedding as our wedding instead and gave an off-the-menu dessert that was rather refreshing. Oh, you gotta hit up the happy hour here. Great deals and sometimes if you're lucky, they'll give you extra food.
