JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This place is great! I've tried a decent amount of dishes from the menu. The ramen is good, packed with flavor, well portioned and the broth isn't too heavy. Some other items that stand out to me are their salmon tacos and bao. The salmon taco is has salmon sashimi and the meat in the bao melts in your mouth. Love this place!
