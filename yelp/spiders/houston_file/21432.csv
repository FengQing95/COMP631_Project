Uchi////The bartenders were very particular in pouring the sake for its guests. Our bartender explained that it's bad luck to pour your own sake. It is always looked well upon to pour it for your other comrades,  Uche only servers a large selection of sake and some types of wine and Japanese beer. No other types of liquor are served. Everything is specially chosen to compliment the menu. Although the menu tend to keep favorite menu items, there are parts that constantly change since the chefs are constantly experimenting with new flavors.
