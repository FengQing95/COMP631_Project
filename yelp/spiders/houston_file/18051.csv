Uchi////We got the 6-course tasting menu, a great value not only for the price, but one that, augmented by two extra dishes, was thoroughly filling and gave a good overview of the restaurant's style. Yellowtail figured into three of the six courses, which may seem limited, but illuminated the palate in its various configurations. A preparation with oranges, ponzu and chili oil was refreshing with a startling, zippy bite; a roll combined the fish with an avocado paste that was perhaps the most 'traditional' offering but was delectable; and the pièce de résistance - a truly "elite" fried rice dish, prepared at the table, lingers in my memory. The tuna with pumpkin oil, goat cheese and apples was oddly delicious. The "fried milk" dessert - essentially a deconstructed chocolate chip cookie - is perhaps the most interesting (in its variety of flavors and textures) and delicious dessert I've had in Houston. our 'additions' - tempura kabocha and seared brussels sprouts - were perfect complements to the meal. Service and atmosphere were spot on.
