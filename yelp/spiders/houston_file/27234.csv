The Pit Room////All I have to say is I've had BBQ meals from Chicago, Tennessee, Missouri and all around the US. I've also made homemade smoked meats myself. This place serves the best smoked bbq brisket, pulled pork, venison sausage, jalape√±o sausage there is! On top of that, the coleslaw, green beans and Mac n cheese were amazing.
