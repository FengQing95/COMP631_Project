Kata Robata////Refined subtle and sophisticated is the theme of this Japanese restaurant. The food is extremely authentic and servers very well informed to guide customers to order the right thing. We order sushi, sashimi, Kobe skewers and soba wheat noodles with duck which turned out to be my favorite. Can never get tired of this place - love it.
