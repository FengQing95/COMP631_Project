The Pit Room////For $18.75 I split the well endowed three meat dinner with my dining partner. We got pulled pork, brisket and venison sausage. The pulled pork was nothing to write home about. I wish we'd gotten the ribs. The brisket was nice, but fell short in smokiness and tenderness. The massive sausage was greasy and savory. I enjoyed the novel flavor and I'd probably order it again.
