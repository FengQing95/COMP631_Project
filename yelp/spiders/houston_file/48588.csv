Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came here with my mom to have a late breakfast at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning. We walked in and BAM!!, there was a line of over a dozen people waiting to get a table. The server said there was a 20 minute wait. I urged my mom to leave after hearing this, but she insisted on staying. 15 minutes later, we were seated in the very back of the restaurant in a very uncomfortable booth.
