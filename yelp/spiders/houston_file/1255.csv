JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've heard/seen pictures of this ramen bar and was dying to try it. I came in for lunch with my dad, and we both got the Tonkotsu Black (Jinya #1). It was the right amount, not too much and not too little. The broth had strong flavoring and the noodles were extremely tasty. Will definitely be coming back!
