Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I came in with really high hopes which is why I was a little disappointed with how things turned out.  Of course the pastries I tried were phenomenal (macarons, scone, croissant) however, the actual food was overpriced and unimaginative.  My friend ordered a $9 "salad" which was simply greens in dressing.  My orange juice was tiny and very expensive (can't remember how much but I do remember feeling ripped off).  Nice atmosphere but I would recommend coming here when you're ready to spend your paycheck on baked goods as opposed to a filling meal.
