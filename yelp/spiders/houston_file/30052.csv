The Pit Room////    They have all the traditional meats you would expect a top notch bbq spot to have.. Ribs, brisket, chicken, sausage, etc.  ny things that is great here is that, let's say your get a 2 meat combo with chicken and brisket, but decide to want some ribs, you don't have to buy a rack. You can buy just one or two.  The next thing I loved, they had a pickle bar. So many different choices of pickled veggies. I was in heaven.
