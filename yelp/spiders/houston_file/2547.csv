JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I'm not giving this place 5 stars (as much deserved for their food) because of my last experience there. My husband & I came in on a not so busy Sunday morning. I requested for a booth instead of the community table. The hostess, a young Asian girl, told us there's no more booths. As she sat us down on the community table, dead in front of us was an open booth. Minutes later that same hostess seated 2 white ladies at that booth. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make a scene. We just sat there & ate our food, feeling upset & pondering...why are we being treated this way? Essentially we're all paying customers, no matter what ethnicity. Just ignorance.
