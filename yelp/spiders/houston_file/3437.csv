JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the decor of this place...but I love the ramen more. I've had their vegan ramen, spicy tonkotsu ramen and their signature tonkotsu/chicken ramen. The vegan ramen was amazing and I was surprised at how rich the broth was. The spicy ramen was my least favorite of the three I've had. It was good but not great. My favorite is their signature bowl (can't remember the name). It had broiled garlic Brussels sprouts (which I don't normally like) and was the best. The broth is what makes a ramen and they definitely are on point.
