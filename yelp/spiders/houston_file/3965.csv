JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Kim - Thanks for your review. I'm sorry you had to wait an unacceptable amount of time for your ramen to reach your table. When we're serving parties of 6 or more, various factors such as appetizers, order modifications and other large parties can cause slight delays. We do our best to accommodate everyone in the order in which the tickets are received, but we're not perfect, as much as we try to be. If you feel there was an egregious amount of time due to a discernible error on our part, please let me know and I would be happy to review our security-camera footage to determine the possible breakdown.
