Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Wow....just wow. This place is amazing! I'm ashamed to say that my husband and I have waited this long to try it. The atmosphere is oh so cozy and the smells are mouth watering! When you walk in and see all the pastries and offerings it's hard not to order one of everything. We got there around 7:30 on a Saturday and decided to have a couple items off of the brunch menu. I eventually decided on the croque madame which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy which were to die for. We also ordered the almond croissant and kouign amann to go, we just couldn't find any room after scarfing down brunch. We can't wait to try the pastries! It is pricey but well worth it as everything is fresh and the portions are generous. We will definitely be back!
