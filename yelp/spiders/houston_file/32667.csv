Local Foods////I read up on a stack of Yelp reviews to guide me on what to have as well as pored over the online menu for a good 10 minutes.  A common refrain were the platitudes being heaped on the truffled egg salad sandwich on a pretzel bun ($9.50), accompanied by 2 sides of one's choice.  All I can say is that it was a wonderfully delightful sandwich that I can fully recommend.
