JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Now to the product itself. We got the ramen within 10 minutes which I appreciated. However, the ramen itself wasn't anything amazing. I've had better ramen. I didn't like the taste of the broth and my egg wasn't runny. The saving grace of the entire bowl was the fatty pork. That was the BEST part of the ramen. I was so displeased with it that I didn't even finish my ramen and I ALWAYS finish my ramen. The noodles were alright.
