The Pit Room////I really enjoyed having my first taste of southern BBQ. My friend wanted to try some BBQ for dinner and The Pit Room was on my Houston collection. I love the space around it, they were playing the football games for the night with everyone socially distancing while eating. Ordering was super easy and the staff was so nice and wonderful.
