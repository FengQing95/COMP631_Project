Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It was good. I must preface that I live in Chicago (one of the best food cities in the world) so I'm a bit tough on breakfast spots. We waited about 20 minutes on a Monday around 1pm (they close at 2:30pm). I ordered the Spuds Deluxe (or something like that), my boyfriend ordered the Benny Duo (the Salmon lox one and the Barbacoa one). We also ordered 2 different mimosas, a hot chocolate and a half-order of OMG French toast. We just wanted to taste it all! After ordering, our food probably took about 15-20 minutes to come out. And everything was good. But just good. My mind wasn't blown, necessarily. But I cleaned my plate, if that makes sense. I wouldn't wait the 2 hours that other reviewers have talked about for it. But I would've waited 30 minutes.
