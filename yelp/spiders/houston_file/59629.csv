Baby Barnaby's////What, we have to wait to get into a restaurant? What is this, San Francisco?? That just shows how popular weekend brunch at Baby Barnaby's Cafe is. For the virgins, you have to write your name on the list when you arrive. Food is delicious. Would choose to have brunch here over Breakfast Klub anytime because there is a seated waiting area and the wait is shorter (15-20 min depending on time, compared to 45 minutes at Breakfast Klub!) A nice place to bring out-of-town-ers but only if you are not in a rush.
