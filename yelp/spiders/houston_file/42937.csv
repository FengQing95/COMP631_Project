Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Parking sucks here and be ready to wait in line. The food is average but the baguette bread and pastries are divine! Seating is set up first come first serve basis with patio option although this Texas heat could give you a stroke! Prices are on the higher side since it's located in the Montrose area but great place for coffee and dessert!
