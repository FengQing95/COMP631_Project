Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Beware that parking is almost nonexistence. They have a small lot in the front but don't count on it. This place is always packed! Your next best bet is street parking. When we walked in, the line was almost out the door. However, it wasn't too bad and it moved quickly. They have every goodies imaginable.
