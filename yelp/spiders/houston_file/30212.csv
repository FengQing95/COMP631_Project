The Pit Room////The brisket was smokey. It was pull apart soft and the meat on the pork ribs fell right off. It was delicious on it's own without the BBQ sauce on the side. I actually even forgot it was there until I cleared my plate. Speaking of forgetting things, I'm annoyed with myself that I forgot to grab the homemade pickle condiments from the bar as I rushed out to sit on the patio.
