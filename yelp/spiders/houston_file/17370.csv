Uchi////The food here is so delish, melt in your mouth, nothing you have ever had before.  They really take their dishes to another level.  If you want to just eat sushi/sashimi or specialty rolls, you can get that somewhere else.  You come here to taste the other novelty stuff.  My favorite place by far and have eaten there 3 times already.  Can't wait to go back. Staff is great.  Too bad they cannot accomodate large parties.  Food is worth the wait.
