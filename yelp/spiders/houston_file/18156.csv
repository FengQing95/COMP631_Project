Uchi////Ham and Eggs Roll: Wow. Pork belly katsu in the roll (the "ham" part), and a egg yolk sauce on the side (the "eggs" part). This was definitely one of the highlights of the meal. We considered ordering another one of these toward the end of the meal, but we were stuffed. Plus, social hour had ended.
