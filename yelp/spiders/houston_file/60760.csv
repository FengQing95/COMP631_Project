Baby Barnaby's////I am a terrible yelper because I always forget to photograph my food before diving in. However, this time is excusable. My girlfriend owns a local restaurant and I spent 8 years serving. So I called it when our server secretly put our order in 30 minutes after we had told it to her. So by time it got to me I was too hungry to wait.
