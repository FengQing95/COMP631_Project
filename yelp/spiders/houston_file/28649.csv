The Pit Room////Hands down the best BBQ in Houston Tx no I didn't say greater Houston but in the actual Houston area I believe this is the best barbecue you're going to Â find from the actual restaurant there not competing with the smoke truck or your backyard barbecue here No it is smoked wonderfully and the rub is excellent it is top secret that you're not going to get the ingredients believe me we tried lol.
