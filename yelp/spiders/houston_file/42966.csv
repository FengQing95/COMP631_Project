Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I wish this place was open when I still lived in Houston! I came here twice during my visit home for Thanksgiving. Since being back in SF, I've been craving the lemon tart and gingerbread lattes. Common Bond wins the award for best bakery in Houston in my book.
