Uchi////Very mixed feelings about this place. I had heard rave reviews from friends so made reservations a month in advance for a birthday; the only time available was 9pm on a Sat night. Complimentary valet parking was convenient, but once we got inside, we were told the previous party was still dining. The place was packed with little space to wait at the wine bar or outdoor patio. We were finally seated around 9:40. The manager did give us a complimentary appetizer to start.
