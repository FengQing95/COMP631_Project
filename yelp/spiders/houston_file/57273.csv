Kata Robata////That should be enough to feed two people, and it was like 17,17,17,9 respectively. A little pricey but those first two items are killer. Third is great, and fourth is a really good item to fill you up (and strangely cheap at that too!). Actually, because the price seemed cheap/fair, it makes me believe the quality of the first three items to be a lot higher.
