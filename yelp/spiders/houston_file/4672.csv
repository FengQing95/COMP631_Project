JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The food here is always so amazing. I am never disappointed. I ordered it to go for the first time and they package the broth separately from the noodles and egg. I appreciate that thought of separating it so noodles don't get soggy. If it's ur 1st or 100th time eating ramen I suggest giving this place a try.
