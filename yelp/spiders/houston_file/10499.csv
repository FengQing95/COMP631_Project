JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////But I think I know which table you're referring to: It's the two-top closer to the entrance than the ramen bar. Unfortunately, that pillar is load-bearing support vital to the structure of the building. Otherwise, I would have much preferred a straight line of tables along the "Mirror Wall." But, alas, as a franchise concept, we are beholden to our corporate headquarters in terms of design elements for our stores.
