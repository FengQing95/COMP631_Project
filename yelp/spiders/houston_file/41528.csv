Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time here and we ordered 6 macrons, chocolate chip cookie, almond croissant and another desert with raisin in it. $35 for everything which wasn't bad but the only one that tasted good was the almond croissant. Everything else was just ok. Macrons were too chewy and not airy. I would come again just for the almond croissant. But I'll have to try their food too. Maybe I'll rate it better when I try their food
