JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Good ramen and Bao ( Jinya bun ). Recommend getting the brussel sprout topping for the ramen. There are around 20 different extra toppings to add if you like loaded ramen or allot of variety. The food is very consistent. You have several different styles of ramen here, and some styles rotate out. I personally favor the tonkotsu black ramen. Nice large portions. I only rate it 4 stars because it's extremely busy almost constantly and you will have long waits. It's not a place for quiet conversation and some of the seating is community seating. Even when it's really busy, food usually comes out fairly quick.
