The Pit Room////Now for the MEAT! I got the three meat meal with brisket, pork ribs, and the jalapeno pork sausage. The brisket was tender and moist. Thing that stood out for this place was their great bark. It was perfect and so damn delicious. The ribs were descent, flavor was good but a little bit firmer than I prefer. As for the sausage, well this was some bomb smoked sausage. The filling was moist and bursting with flavor and seasoning. This place has a high rating for a reason.
