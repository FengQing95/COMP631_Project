Kata Robata////Pretty people everyone and great food.  Since it was literally our second dinner, we had no room for dessert although we would have been all over it.  The pricing is nothing ridiculous for that part of town but not your Ra or Aka kind of pricing.  So we know how a favorite sushi spot in Houston and glad we took the suggestion from a friend and Yelp.  :)
