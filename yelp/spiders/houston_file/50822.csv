Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////OMG so good , definitely worth it ! As someone who despises eating breakfast and prefers only coffee and fruit , the pancakes were the best with the ginger butter. I got the sweet potato pancakes and my boyfriend (btw he's a big breakfast critic) got the French toast with eggs, bacon , and potatoes. Completely worth the 45 minute wait because you're in for good treat
