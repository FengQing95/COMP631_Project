Kata Robata////We ordered mainly sushi and tried the uni, cherry salmon, and foie gras and scallop sushi. Honestly... so delicious! The salmon literally melts into your tongue and it so delicate and fresh. The foie gras and scallop were to die for... just so yummy. As for the uni, it was my first time trying it so I was pretty excited; it has an interesting texture (creamy) and I liked it. After that, we shared 2 of their special rolls: Longhorn and Tropical Spicy Tuna. Both of them were very good... I'm a big fan of eel so I knew I would like the Longhorn. The Tropical roll has pieces of mango that add a touch of sweetness to it, which really compliments the flavour of the spicy tuna. Our meal was finished with some dessert because... why not! The warm blueberry cake was scrumptious; I liked how they incorporate earl grey tea into their ice cream.
