Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////A party of 4 would've had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday around 1pm. That's not too bad but we were able to find a spot at the bar. BEST DECISION EVER! Matt (also known as Mustache Matt) took great care of us! He kept our mimosas coming and was a joy to have as our bartender. Although the environment was already phenomenal, Matt made it THAT much better.
