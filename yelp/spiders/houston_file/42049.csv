Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We could see servers walking by with the mortadella and eggplant parmesean and craved those as well. The mortadella had this incredible thick looking pistachio bread. (I might try to just buy the bread next time) I would love to go back and try some of their other foods.
