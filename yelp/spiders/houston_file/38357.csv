Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Now on with the food review. It was five of us total and we started off with some great libations and some delicious appetizers. We had the Hot Chicken Dip + Chips, Pulled Pork Hush Puppies, and Cornbread Medallions. All were splendid, but for me the Hot Chicken Dip + Chips was the bomb digity!!!!!!  I'm tryna told y'all something but ya ain't tryna heard me!!! Yep I'm from New Orleans and this dish is certified and verified folk!!!! Okay Hot Chicken is a Memphis thing, but I'm claiming this spicy app for my city!!  LOL!!!
