The Pit Room////The Pit Room continues to give me bbq life. Don't be discouraged by the line. It's worth the wait and moves very quickly! The beef ribs are pretty tasty but not really my jam. I love their brisket, ribs, and tacos. I enjoy their sides. But the ELOTES. OMG!!!! YUM YUM YUM. Don't play yourself and skip on that. You will regret it. Also some of the things that I enjoy is that they have a self serve bbq fixings bar that has the pickled onions/carrots/jalapenos. Very delectable. Do yourself a favor and add some of that greatness to your plate. If you are in the area then definitely drop in. They have inside and some outside seating. Parking can get a little crazy though.
