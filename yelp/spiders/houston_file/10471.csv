JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The venue is very modern with a rustic touch.  We came in on a Friday night around 9:30 and there was still a wait but it was not very long for 5 people.  The only major mishap throughout the night was that they kept on bringing the food the table next to us ordered.  Not sure if the waitress was new or she didn't put in the right table number.  Besides that service was ok.
