Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Savory: The Benny Duo option lets you pick two eggs benedicts to try for an extra $1. The Benny Goodman was my favorite -- a twist on the traditional lox eggs benedict with a refreshing tomato and caper relish. The Chilaquiles was a little too weird for my friends and me and was more like a breakfast taco disguised as an eggs benedict. The corned beef hash was also tasty. The beef is tender and flavorful. Would be even tastier with some spice or salsa added to it!
