Kata Robata////To start, I'd recommend the agedashi tofu and the Texas kobe beef skewers. The tofu is typical to what you'd find at other restaurants and is perfect for sharing. The Texas Kobe Beef Skewers are not an appetizer option but it's probably one of the best decisions you can make. It's so tender and savory... you won't regret it.
