Kata Robata////Everything here is SO good but pretty pricey, so it loses a star for that. Their happy hour can be fairly reasonable though. My friend and I ordered a bunch of appetizers like the tuna poke (which was AMAZING btw), the pork buns, and the tacos. My all time favorite was the duck dumpling ramen, not on the happy hour menu. The staff is very friendly and prompt. Our waiter could give us pretty accurate descriptions of all the dishes we asked him about. Would definitely go again, but probably not until after payday.
