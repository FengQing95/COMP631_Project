Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries, macarons, breads are all out of this world. Perfectly laminated, buttery croissants with amazing airy interiors. Delectable almond pastries with a perfect amount of frangipane. Macarons fresh and slightly chewy, well-filled, not in any way dry. Bread with mature flavors and a gorgeous crust. A delightful hazelnut brioche. Hooray! Then you have the fact that they do things as unusual as kouign amann and kugelhopf, and I'm sold. (Having a Breton husband we have not tried the kouign amann yet, for fear of disappointment.)
