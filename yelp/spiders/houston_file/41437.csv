Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This is my ABSOLUTE favorite place to eat in Houston for lunch! The food is always creative, innovative, smart and delicious. I come every week to try the new menu options. I've never been disappointed and I bring a new person with me every chance I get. It's that good. Don't let the "sides" fool you...they're full portioned and will never let you down. Try at least two items and something sweet when you come. The chocolate chip cookie is to die for. It's got buttery, crunchy edges and smooth creamy chocolate, baked tender and to perfection EVERY time. Here's a list of my faves: pain perdu, kougn ahmann (sells out quickly!), any torta, almond croissant, carnitas terrine, bean and veggie ragu, and ANYTHING eggplant...I've never had an eggplant that I liked until I tried two different versions of eggplant here (eggplant agradolce and Asian bahn mi). I'm watching the menu every week waiting for the eggplant to return. Please come back to me!!!
