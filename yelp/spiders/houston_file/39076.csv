Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Service: Service was wonderful! We even had the owner come to our table and offer the birthday boy shots. I've never had an owner interact as much as he did. I didn't even get his name but he was 6'11 and he was fit for his age. (I was looking at some yelp reviews and they even mention how kind he was too so I wasn't the only one) Spencer was my waiter he attended to our needs and had A1 service. He literally came and go every 5-10 minutes. Enjoyed both their services!
