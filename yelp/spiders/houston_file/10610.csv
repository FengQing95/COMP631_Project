JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Troy - Thanks for your review! I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen and are able to compare it to other ramen bowls you have tried around the U.S. In regards to the cabbage topping, did you inform your server that you wanted bok choy instead of regular cabbage? We do offer bok choy (it's the baby bok choy you mention) as an additional topping, which we label as such to avoid confusion with any of our other vegetable toppings. But from the tone of your review, that doesn't sound like it was a dealbreaker! Thank you for dining with us, and we look forward to serving you again soon.
