Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've been here a few times actually and just now taking the time to review after visiting this past weekend with a friend from out of town. She loved it! She had one of their vegetarian sandwiches and could not stop talking about how good it was! I had the hot chicken sandwich, which was actually delicious, and the hubs had the pepperoni flat bread that also didn't disappoint.
