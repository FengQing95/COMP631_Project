JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I love the aesthetic of the restaurant, and service so far has been good (I've been here twice). We waited a bit for a table on a Saturday for lunch, but once we sat down, the server waited on us promptly and we didn't wait long for the food to come out. The ramen is also amazing and very flavorful. There is a vegan option, and the broth is so good you can also add meat to the vegan broth. Minus 1 star only because I got the new shrimp ramen and it wasn't good. Why roll shrimp in tempura when it's just going to get soggy in soup?
