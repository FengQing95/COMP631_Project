Local Foods////I am pretty much in love with this place. My fiancee and I went on an early Sunday evening, and were really blown away. I had the crab and shrimp sandwich, he had the tuna with capers sandwich. We both had the kale side as well as the barley and beets. I don't think I have had a better sandwich in along time. It was clearly worth the $12 price tag. The next time we went we both had the arugula salad but subbed the shrimp for the caper tuna salad. It was equally as amazing! The mint-aide is also to die for. The service from the guys behind the counter has always been super friendly and accommodating, even when we came in like 2 minutes before close accidentally. I high recommend you visit Local Foods!
