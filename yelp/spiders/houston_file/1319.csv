JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Very crowded with no proper waiting area. Female bartender was useless on drink or food recommendations. She couldn't even provide any type of information in terms of flavor profiles. Service speed was average. Portions are very generous. I might go back, but I'm not in a rush.
