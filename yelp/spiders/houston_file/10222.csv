JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I REALLY like Jinya! Therefore, these CAPS are entirely necessary. I actually somehow found myself there twice this past week so you better believe it's good! After having ramen in Japan, I figured I'd never find anything even remotely comparable here in Houston. However, Jinya proved I don't have to fly thousands of miles to enjoy some tasty noodles.
