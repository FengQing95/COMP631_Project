Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////My husband is a burger guy and since I am a calorie counter we split the Bosscat Burger made the chef's way. That meant you couldn't change anything about the burger. The burger was awesome and was more than enough for us to share. Additionally, we had the Bosscat fries and the whiskey okra.
