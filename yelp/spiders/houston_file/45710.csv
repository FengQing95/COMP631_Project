Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is  5 star in every single thing thy make. The K Amman is the  absolute best thing I have ever eaten, The  croissants are huge  and  lite, fluffy! The Chocolate  chip walnut cookies are the best Ive  eaten but I go there  twice a  week for the Texas Club sandwich, it is the best sandwich in Houston. The pile that turkey high, many slices of perfect bacon, fresh tomato and lettuce, absolutely the best Ive ever had. I call it in for pick up, its  faster. If you cant park in the parking lot no problem, park on the street, always  places  close...please dont  sweat the parking there.. You wont be towed  from the street. But do go there you will not be disappointed..Another homerun for Johnny Carraba.
