Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////First time here. Good reviews. Now I see why. Amazing food. Got croque madame and quiche Lorraine with mimosas and coffee. Both entrees where excellent. Coffee fresh bold but not bitter. Yes a big crowd on Sat AM but efficient service. Will be back to try Eggs Benedict w tamale. Many others eating this. Looked great.
