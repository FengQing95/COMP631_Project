Kata Robata////This establishment serves excellent food. The Kobe beef skewers were out standing and the sushi was outstanding. The reason I did not give it five stars was the flowing. The server was efficient, but not hospitable. When we asked her about the choices her only comment was that it was popular. She seemed to struggle to put two dishes on the table and we had to assit her.  We asked to her if we could taste ththe wine to make a choice for a botfly and she could mot comprehend that concept. Also the chairs were not that comfortable  and I think a restaurant could invest more in aesthetics.
