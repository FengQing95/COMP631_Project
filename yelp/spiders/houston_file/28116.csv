The Pit Room////One of the newer much anticipated BBQ joints that was opening in the Montrose area. The interior was refreshing with open wood beams and booth style seating. It was rumored that the previous pit master that worked at Franklin' BBQ had left because of a dispute with the ownership and opened his own BBQ place in the Conservatory called El Burro and the Bull.
