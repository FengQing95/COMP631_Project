JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////After day 3 of my first year of Houston sinus issues, I stumbled across this place after typing "soup" into the search field on Yelp. I decided not to order until I got there, not paying attention to the Midtown address and the fact that it was a weekend evening, and upon arrival was greeted by a trendy, millennial-friendly entrance, crawling with a line of people out the door.
