JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The biggest complaint is the small space, for a concept so successful, I would love to see a new location with more seating and a larger wait space, the bar is also very small and it feels cramped. If you are claustrophobic, plan accordingly as sometimes you can be seated immediately and other times there is a 30 minute wait.
