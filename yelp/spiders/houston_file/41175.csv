Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Incredible pastries, good coffee, friendly staff. Their brunch items are unique and change frequently. The line is insane on Saturdays and Sundays and they will sometimes sell out of the best brunch items, if you want to avoid those issues get there early! The almond croissant is killer.
