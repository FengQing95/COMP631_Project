The Pit Room////Absolutely the best BBQ in Houston!  The mouth watering anticipation from the smokey smell of the brisket as you walk up is completely backed up by the taste.  Each of the sides is delicious and of course the meat options are all to die for.  It's definitely worth making a trip on a Saturday to try the wagyu rib - it's so big that it looks like a dinosaur bone and have a very unique, melt-in-your-mouth bbq flavor.  Don't miss out on trying this Houston landmark!
