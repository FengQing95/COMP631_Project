Uchi////Based on our first try of Uchi on May 5 (5 pm opening), I would say that Â the ratings the place is getting are excessive. Uchi has great possibilities, but it's not yet flawless as some have stated, and given it's priciness, I think it's got to perform better over the long haul. But by the look of things, diners are eating it up and not complaining.
