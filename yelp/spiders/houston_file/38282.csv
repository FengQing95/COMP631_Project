Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////DELICIOUS! The food choices were amazing and fun. The service was expert and fast. In and out! The portions were nice and fulfilling! It's a good place for friends and family, big gatherings, and even kids. There's lots of TVs and alcohol so it can be a loud gathering place! Overall I would definitely recommend trying it if you stumble upon this on Yelp as an option! Look no further, go try it, you won't be disappointed!
