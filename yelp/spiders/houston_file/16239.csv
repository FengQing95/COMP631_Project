JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Not gonna lie, when it comes to ramen, I am ridiculously picky. I can count on one hand the number of ramen shops (outside of Japan itself) I think are worth frequenting, so I was very pleasantly surprised by JINYA. It's quickly become my favorite ramen spot in Houston.
