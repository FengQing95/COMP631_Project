JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hello Natalie - Thank you for your review. I'm sorry you did not enjoy our ramen. Although takeout ramen is not optional, it is our ONLY option for service at the present time. You said the quality was a major letdown. Can you expound further on what you found wrong with your meal?
