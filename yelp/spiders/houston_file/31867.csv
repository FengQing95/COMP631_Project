Local Foods////With regard to service, around lunchtime this place is something of a madhouse (like, the share your table with strangers kind) so it takes them a little while to get your food out to you.  It's worth the wait, though, and the people at the front are super charming and helpful.  They did not even roll their eyes with my mom ordered duck confit and pronounced the t, as many a cultured youth might be tempted to do.  So, you know what, take your time with the food, I'll wait, y'all are cool.
