The Pit Room////SUCH GOOD BBQ!! I'm from the country and this stuff is for sure the best around. I recommend sausage and brisket. But what sales a good BBQ joint to me is if their sides are good, and man the green beans are slap yo momma good! I like the vibes inside, a lot of people tend to pick up and leave though. Parking lot isn't the best and there's always broken glass in it it seems.
