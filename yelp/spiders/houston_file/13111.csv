JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Food: I've been here twice the past 2 weeks and basically ordered the same things both times since it was so delicious. The pork buns were savory but the pork itself wasn't "melt in you mouth" tender. Either way, it was a great appetizer for Houston pork bun standards. For the main course I ordered the Tonkatsu Black which was delicious! I love the thin noodles, the pork was cooked well, and it came with a soft boiled egg ( I Love eggs). The only negative about the dish was that it did not have as much flavor as I would have liked. However, the table does come with hot sauce and Ramen Seasoning (which is AMAZING) so I was able to personalize my soup to the way I wanted it.
