Uchi////By far the best restaurant I have ever been.  This was my third visit, and every time my palette is overjoyed with perfect pairings, creatively beautiful platings, and an overwhelming sense that I am in culinary heaven.  The best way to experience Uchi is what I call "Blind Sushi"...letting the chef present you with entrees until you say stop. But always finish on a sweet note.  The pictures are a few of the plates I remembered to take a picture of. Haha.
