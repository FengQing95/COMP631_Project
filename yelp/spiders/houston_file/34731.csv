Local Foods////Local foods is amazing!! I love their crunchy chicken sandwich. The sandwich has so much flavor, and it's made with fresh ingredients. If it's too messy to eat, you can get it as a salad and it's just as delicious without the extra carbs! I didn't give the full 5 stars because I don't particularly like any of the sides. If you're a fan of super foods like quinoa and kale, then the sides are perfect for you. However, I'd like to see some more variety in the side options. I always end up getting fruit because I don't eat the sides anyways.
