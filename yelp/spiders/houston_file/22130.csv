Uchi////I remember ordering a lot of the items (walu walu, ham and egg, Hama chilli) but all the flavors just sort of blend together. Â Like a bland shallow conversation, there were snippets of interesting parts but I can't remember much that stood out and made me go "wow, this place really deserves 4.5 stars on yelp."
