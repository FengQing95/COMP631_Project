Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great atmosphere and fantastic bourbon list. A few friends and I went to try out their brunch. The service was great but the food was extremely bland. Tried the steak flatbread (steak nor the eggs were seasoned). I personally had the country fried steak and the sauce tasted like bland chili (almost like they were leaning on nutmeg and beans for flavoring the sauce). The breading was not even properly seasoned! Someone needs to tell "Chef" that salt and pepper go a long way. No balance in flavor. Will definitely be back for bourbon and would certainly try a few things on the dinner menu.
