JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////service was good--I ordered the chicken noodle bowl, was luke warm and half the noodles it should have had--I ordered their free garlic and asked for it to be crushed, 5 stars for that--my son ordered the rice chicken bowl, and again luke warm--for spending $40 dollars and we all had water and no extras, I want hot food, and not wait when there are empty tables--its not just the food, its the experience
