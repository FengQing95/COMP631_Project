Kata Robata////Afterwards, I tried the Kobe Beef skewers and let me tell you, I could have gotten 5 orders of those and could have called it a night! They were absolutely delicious, tender, and the sauce (I want to say it is a variation of a pesto/chimichurri type of sauce) complemented it very well.
