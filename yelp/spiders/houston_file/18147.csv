Uchi////This place is unreal. Best meal I've ever had and seemingly the most well run restaurant I've ever been too. All of the staff is happy, friendly and seems to work well together. I've been to much fancier and expensive restaurants and none of them even come close to Uchi. Perfect mix of class and quality without all the pretense. Thanks for a great experience. BTW, I hardly ever review places but this place earned it.
