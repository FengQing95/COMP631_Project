Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yes, there's always a long line that's annoying to wait on. Yes, it's always crowded. Yes, it's not fun to be around so many ridiculous, wealthy Houstonites and obnoxious millennials. But it's worth it--you can tell that Common Bond really cares about putting out quality products. We wish they would open a branch in Austin!
