The Pit Room////All in all, if you like BBQ and are in the area, avoid standing in line at Killen's and give The Pit Room a try. I'm a pretty discerning guy, who is tough to please, and I really have no complaints. I can't really see myself driving out to Pearland again when The Pit Room is closer to me and has no line. So I suppose all in all I think I like it more than Killen's.
