Uchi////I was here on 9/15 for a birthday. I would strongly recommend to make a reservation here...for some reason when my friend called she was told it wouldn't be a problem to seat her party at 9:30pm on a Saturday (wrong). When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 1.5 hour...and we were seated after a 1.5 hr! During the wait we got complimentary edamame which was cooked differently than a typical Japanese restaurant. My friends ordered tempura fried shrimp and cauliflower. The tempura cauliflower was amazing - it had such great flavor- which is surprising because it is one of my least favorite vegetable.
