Local Foods////Super duper delicious. The crunchy chicken sandwich reviewed, oh so many times, was very good. I will say that in one photo, the chicken appears to be crusted. This is also what the menu states. I'm sorry to say that it is not...doing that may be the only thing that would make this sandwich better. (Though I assume this way is more heart heathy. Boo.) The sammy has a generous, heaping portion of chicken, stone ground mustard, herb ranch, lettuce, tomato, pickles and homemade potato chips. The coup de gras is the pretzel bread toasted with provolone. I will write a love poem to it in my free time this week. One thing Local has really mastered is distributing the toppings evenly throughout the sandwich. Most places put them all on a pile in the center. Here, every single bite hosts a little smattering of everything.
