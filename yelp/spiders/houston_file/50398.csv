Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Visit one: I had a Chile Verde Benny, and Chilaquiles Benedict they were amazing! I am not complaining at all they were top notch, but when a lovely woman sat next to me and ordered a trio of pancakes, I was jealous. Theresa was sweet enough to get me one on the house, to calm down the green eyed monster within me. She was really sweet.
