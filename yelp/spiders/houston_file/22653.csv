Uchi////For those growing up with Asian food, the flavors at Uchi aren't going to dazzle you-- sure, they will be good, but you'll definitely be paying more for the atmosphere and presentation than anything else. We had braised veal cheek, and it tasted like the meat from Taiwanese beef noodle soup (albeit prettier presentation!). Â The crunchy tuna roll was tasty, but not something impossible to find outside of the establishment~ ^^' ham and egg roll was different, something okay to try, but I would never crave it.
