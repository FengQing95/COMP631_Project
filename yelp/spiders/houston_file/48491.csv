Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Went for the first time at the grand opening and was very impressed, place was packed and the staff was extremely friendly.  I ordered the Lower East Side which is their version of lox and bagels and it was amazing, it comes with a hard boiled egg and since I'm allergic to eggs, they substituted for avocado. My husband ordered the duo Benny which is a combination of 2 egg Benedict types and he thought it was amazing too.  They changed the version of the hollandaise sauce to something that seemed like it had cream cheese and it was a great version.  On this day the meal was free and the waitstaff was not taking tips only donations for a non profit which I thought was very nice! Angela, our waitress was very sweet and efficient. Will definitely be back for brunch so we can try the bloody Mary's and mimosas.   Now go try it!!!
