Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////My cousins and I stopped here for brunch and we loved it! We tried another brunch spot a few weeks later and all agreed that we wanted to go back to Snooze. They ordered the French toast and were full by the time they finished. (They are both VERY tall and athletically hungry). I ordered the flight of pancakes and they were AMAZING! I don't usually eat pancakes but these were exceptional
