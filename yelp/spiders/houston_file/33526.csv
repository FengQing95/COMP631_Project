Local Foods////Everything on the menu looked incredible, but I ended up ordering the "Crunchy" Chicken sandwich with the Tuscan kale and quinoa as my side dishes. The "Crunchy" Chicken sandwich looked even better in person than it seemed in the menu description and tasted even better than it looked. The crushed chips and nut "crumble" provided an excellent textural contrast with the soft pretzel bun and tender chicken that was piled high on the sandwich. The buttermilk ranch was rich and creamy and the tomatoes were fresh (although I do wish they were sliced thinner). The Tuscan kale was really tasty too. I enjoyed the addition of the pine nuts which added a nice crunch to the dish. I can't really comment about the quinoa was my girlfriend swapped it with her kale (she wasn't too fond of it). I had a couple bites of my girlfriend's Turkey Confit sandwich which was really tasty, although it could have done with some more of the cranberry preserves.
