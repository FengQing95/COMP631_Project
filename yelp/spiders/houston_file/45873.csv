Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yum yum yum! This place came very highly recommended to me so I just had to try it while in town for a few days. My boyfriend and I made this our last stop before the airport. It wasn't too busy when we visited on Tuesday morning but I heard the line is often very long. We got the pear and earl grey tea scone which was FANTASTIC! I have never tasted anything like it and I could have eaten ten more. Â We also got the pistachio croissant which was hands down the best croissant I have ever had.
