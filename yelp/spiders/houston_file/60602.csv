Baby Barnaby's////I absolutely LOVE the potatoes at Barnaby's. They're crispy nuggets of deliciousness. The Green Egg's are most definitely green and a little softer then I am used to. The flavor was delicious, however, and full of spinach, artichoke, and Â jack cheese. Bob's Healthy Plate has six egg whites, chicken apple sausage, and a fruit cup. I had a bite of the egg whites and they were very fluffy. The salsa that they come with is a must for dipping.
