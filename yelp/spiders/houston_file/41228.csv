Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////This place is amazing. The chocolate croissants are to die for, as are all the verrines, the banana bread, the chocolate chip cookies, the salted caramel macarons--basically all the sweets. The chicken torta is delicious and big enough for two. A hidden gem is their Sunday night pizza nights--delicious!  I had the best caprese salad I've ever eaten in my life at one of those pizza nights--and I've eaten a lot of caprese salads!  The staff is young and fun but very attentive. The only down side is the weekend crowds. I've had best luck on with a late lunch on Saturday around 1:30 ish and early on pizza night.
