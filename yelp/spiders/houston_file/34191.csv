Local Foods////I could not help but notice the mint-kaffir lime vinaigrette mentioned on the tofu salad (my other option under consideration) so I got it on the side to try and ended up dousing the beets in it.  Overall, the atmosphere is bright and nice, the food different but delicious, and the prices decent.  Many tables are communal but we were around other ladies lunching and felt fine having our own conversation at the table.  Definitely get the egg salad, because it has truffle essence and NO CELERY!  Halleluyah!
