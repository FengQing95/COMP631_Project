JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////In a perfect world, we would have built a much larger restaurant, but if there's one thing I've learned about this industry after 20+ years, it's that there's no such thing as a perfect restaurant. That said, we work hard to keep the tables turning without letting anyone feel like they're being rushed along. We just want to serve as many Houstonians our ramen as efficiently as we can.
