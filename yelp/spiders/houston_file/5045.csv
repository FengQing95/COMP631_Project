JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////BEST. RAMEN. EVER.  I've tried it all.  This place is one of my favorite restaurants and definitely the best ramen restaurant in Houston.  The Slurp Up Cilantro is amazing.  My kids even love it and request it for dinner all the time.  I have converted everyone I know to Jinya and will continue doing so. :)
