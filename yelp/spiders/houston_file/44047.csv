Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Lady at coffee station looks at me oddly as I am asking for another cup, rude male employee states no refills are given for this cup, I proceeded to state that I had checked on this when I made my Purchase and I was told I was able to. I even told him to go back and check with lady in register. Rude male continues to express his disapproval while I continue to restate my side. He finally agrees to provide me with a refill stating he will bring it to my table.
