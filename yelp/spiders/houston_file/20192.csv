Uchi////- A friend and I got there at 4:30 and waited in line, since we didn't have reservations. Since we didn't have our full party, we had to wait until they all arrived before being seated. And by that time, it was like another hour wait. Moral of the story? Make reservations! Or if you're going to wait in line, wait with the entire party!
