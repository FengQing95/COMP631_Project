Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////We've been here several times and I would say I loved it on the past but and underwhelmed by them now. The staff member rang us up wrong and after I brought this up, he assured us it was the same price (it wasn't, there was a 25 cent difference but it's the principal.)he didn't know the menu and wasn't able to answer questions regarding the menu. Interior and ambience is cute but I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.
