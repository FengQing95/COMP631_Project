Kata Robata////And to apologize for forgetting our roll (or maybe because our friend was being such an ass to her?), she of course took the roll off our bill, but also brought us gratis the most AMAZING dessert EVER!!!  Please order this when you go; I was blown away and I hate dessert.  I never eat it.  But I ate this one!   It was a nitrogen-frozen white chocolate mousse (can't find it on the online Kata Robata menu so I don't know the official name).  Good lord this thing was good - a tasty fresh huckleberry sauce on the side and green tea streusel.  Man I could eat this every day.
