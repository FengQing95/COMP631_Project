Uchi////every single dish we had was surprisingly tasty, including the dessert. Don't think it's the most authentic, but they taste great. Â We sat at the bar and the sushi chef was very friendly. Also a waitress or maybe a chef(?) came over and described the desserts to us, she seems to know the menu very well and I thought that was superb service. Will definitely return again~
