Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Atmosphere: this place has a very local feel to it and be willing to share your space with a complete stranger... It is called Common Bond for a reason! There is limited seating and the way the tables are set up, don't be surprised if the person next to you isn't part of your group. I do like the space, however because of how open it is.
