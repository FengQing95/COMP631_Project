JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya has some of the best ramen in Houston! I usually go at off times, so there is never really any wait. The staff are great, the cocktails are okay. The parking is meh, but for good ramen, I'll put up with it. Their cha cha cha dish is my favorite, and I recommend making your ramen into a combo!
