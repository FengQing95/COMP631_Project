JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Breanna - Thank you for your review. I have often said that JINYA ramen will never be all things to all people, and personal taste and palates are very subjective, but for every critique we receive that states we lack authenticity, I could argue we have a matching review that states the contrary. Nevertheless, I am glad you still considered our ramen good enough for a positive review, and for that I am extremely grateful. We hope to have the privilege of serving you again in the future.
