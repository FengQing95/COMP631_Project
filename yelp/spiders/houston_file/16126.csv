JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've eaten many a ramen and JINYA consistently is a favorite, especially for a good vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian option. If you're in the mood for ramen, JINYA consistently brings forth an incredible selection. I've only eaten the vegetarian options and they are great! Surprisingly, the two vegan options (yes 2), are better than the vegetarian option. The broth is creamy and the noodles are thick and flavorful. With endless add-ons, you can have a slightly different experience each time you come here.
