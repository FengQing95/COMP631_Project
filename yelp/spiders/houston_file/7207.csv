JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Lilianne - Thank you for the great review. I'm glad you enjoyed our ramen. Unfortunately, with all of our dishes, we are required to follow strict recipe guidelines. Therefore, some dishes are designed with seasoned eggs and some are without. We appreciate your understanding, and we hope to serve you again soon.
