Baby Barnaby's////I ate here for the first time last weekend and There are so many good things I can write about this little nook. The staff is very friendly, there was a guy and a girl serving the whole place and making conversations with all the tables. It is a fairly small place but that's a good thing. Everything is very intimate. Waiting for your food here is like waiting for your mother serve you breakfast and whatever it was you got you knew it was good. Orange juice is always fresh. The pancake was awesome,didn't even need syrup. You just enjoy it for the pancake it is. I got the breakfast plate with grits and biscuits, which are all home made. My girlfriend got the corned beef hash, which I probably ate more than she did. The potatoes were very crunchy, flavorful and soft inside. When you pop the yolk on top of the skillet it just call came together. The only down side is parking but If you can't find parking, you don't deserve breakfast.
