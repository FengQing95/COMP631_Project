Uchi////This is by far my favorite restaurant in Houston, and I quite honestly cannot think anyplace I would rather eat in this glorious country.  I have been visiting Uchi since they opened in Houston and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend going for the happy hour menu and getting one of everything (maybe 2 of the WaluWalu).  Happy Hour is a great way to experience a selection of everything on the menu and a great price.
