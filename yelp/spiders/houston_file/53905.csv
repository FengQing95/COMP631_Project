Kata Robata////Kata is tucked into a cramped shopping center on Kirby, so parking can be a bit of a nightmare, but is manageable if you don't go on a Friday or Saturday night. I sat at the sushi bar on both occasions because I enjoy a good show with my dinner and the activity going on behind the counter of this sushi bar is very entertaining. I'm sure the traditional seating is good, but I'm all about the sushi bar.
