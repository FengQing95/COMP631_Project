Local Foods////Tuscan kale salad was absolutely memorable. I'm not the best at making salads myself, but after really focusing on this one, a lot of what they did make sense. Props to using golden raisins that were quite juicy. I've never heard of them before and don't recall seeing them at grocery stores...but the balance of the salty and savory parmesan and juicy and sweet golden raisins was ON POINT. Soba noodles were great too in terms of the thin dressing and crunchy veggies that went along with it.
