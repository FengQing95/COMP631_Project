Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love common bond! I was concerned that quality and customer care would drop off when ownership changed hands but its much much better now.  Expanded hours, more seating,  nicer servers. They also make more quantities so things don't run out early. You can now go in for dinner and still get good selection of goodies. One thing that changed forever, the main reason that I put up with their previous crappy service was their seeded baguette. It is no more.  They must have not passed on the recipe because it isn't the same. Last time I went, they didn't even have it anymore, so it may be lost forever.
