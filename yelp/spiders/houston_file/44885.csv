Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Yum-freakin-o. I absolutely fell in love with everything this place had to offer except for the seating arrangement. Its first come first serve which is understandable but I wish they had more seats available. I had the French toast and a caramel latte. They were both amazing. I dont believe they make the French toast cook to order but that's ok. I absolutely loved it. The latte was as beautiful down to the last drop. Highly reccomend.
