JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I would give them 4.5 stars if Yelp allowed it. I subtracted a half point because the price for ramen is pretty high, My dish was about $10  and his was about $12. I know we were eating in Midtown and the rent  is high, but ramen is not meant to be expensive, and our meal ran about $50 with a good tip.. Overall, I would recommend Jinya, and I will be back, if I can't find a comparable menu in Chinatown, a little closer to where I live.
