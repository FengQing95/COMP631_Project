JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////We came for dinner after finding this place on YELP! Everything was great! Super busy though!! I ordered a Mojito while waiting for a table. The waiter recommended my Ramen Dish, The Vegan Harvest & it was tasty. I asked for no tofu bc I don't like soft tofu, I like prefer fried! My daughter really enjoyed her Sprouting Up Ramen, there were thick slices of juicy pork, her first bite brought a BIG SMILE. The servers are very busy so be sure to ask for everything you'll need as they're tending to so many people. I wanted some house sauces to add to my ramen but didn't see him in time to get it. The shrimp appetizer was AMAZING!!! My favorite of all, that & the margarita (with Don Julio). I wasn't a fan of the Mojito but finished it bc well, I paid for it lol. My daughter & I both enjoyed our ramen, a little too much, we stuffed ourself to the max! This is a nice place. Every staff we passed on the way out thanked us & said goodnight. Sweet!
