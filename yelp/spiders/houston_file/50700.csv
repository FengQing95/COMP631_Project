Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I reluctantly cannot give this place 5 stars soley due to their service. Because of how crowded it was, I felt as if we were being rushed through our meal. Our waiter went a bit overboard and continuously asked if we were done with our meal, whether we were ready for our checks. Slightly rude, IMO.
