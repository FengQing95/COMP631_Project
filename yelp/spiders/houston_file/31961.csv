Local Foods////The only reason this place isn't a full fledged 5 stars is because of the prices, the prices for the sandwiches have been slowly creeping up. Now all sandwiches are well above the $10 mark, and the ones with the premium ingredients (i.e. duck, seafood) are only getting higher. Although I am all about paying for quality, sometimes I can't block out my mother's voice saying "What?!? $15 for a sandwich, do you know how many poor kids you could feed with that?!".
