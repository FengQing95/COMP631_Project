JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Also, some patrons prefer their sodas highly carbonated; unfortunately, that is not how our CO2 system is set up. I hope you had asked to take the soda off your tab. Also, with all of pork-based ramen dishes, we serve 2 pieces of chashu, and sometimes the slices of chashu are not separated so it appears to be one very thick piece instead. That may have occurred with your bowl.
