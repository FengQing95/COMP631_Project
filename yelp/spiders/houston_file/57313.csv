Kata Robata////Came for lunch on the weekend (they do full menu all day), although I wish I could have tried their weekday lunch menu. It was actually quite busy but everyone was spaced well and if you sit at the sushi bar, there is a plastic wall between you and the sushi chefs. I ordered the duck ramen because it sounded so different. As well as a piece of salmon and yellowtail. Everything was soo good! I normally don't like it when they put wasabi in the sushi because it tends to overpower the fish and they put too much but I could barely taste it. The fish was delicate and buttery, what more could you want? I was a little hesitant to pay that much for sushi but with the quality that Kata Robata has, I will certainly do it again! We also ordered the rising sun roll and the hint of truffle was amazing! We will definitely be coming again.
