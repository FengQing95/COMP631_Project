Local Foods////I really love eating at this place, especially their crunchy chicken sandwich and the truffle egg sandwich! Although, I would love it if they could list their nutrition information on their website or not heir menu. i understand that it's farm to table type of restaurant, but the lack of their nutrition information has turned me away from going there for lunch. I asked the person at the register if there was any way for them to begin doing so, and she said "it would be too hard for them to do that". I was very disappointed at her response, so now my weekly lunches here has now been limited. I just want to know what I'm putting in my body, that's all.
