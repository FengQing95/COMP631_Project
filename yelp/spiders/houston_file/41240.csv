Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I absolutely love this place. Lovely atmosphere and setting: so European. The food is pretty amazing too: best pain perdu and pulled pork sandwich I've ever had. Caramel latte is pretty good- I'll order "extra hot" next time since it was rather cold when served. Cheese cake is great and so are the chocolate croissants, oh and huge! Servers are pretty friendly too except for one who wasn't too pleased when I asked him to warm up my drink and then a to go box. Will definitely go back for pain perdu and try out the assortment of pastries!
