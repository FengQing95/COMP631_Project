JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////TONKOTSU, TONKOTSU, TONKOTSU BLACK RAMEN! By far the BEST ramen bar in Houston! I order mine with a seasoned egg, poached egg, and pork soboro. The best days are the days I come here after a long day at school. The wait time is a little high but what would you expect? It's in downtown AND it has the best ramen Houston has to offer. Y'all need to check it out, you won't regret it!
