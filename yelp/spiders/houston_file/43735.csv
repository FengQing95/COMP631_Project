Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I do not like big chocolate chunks.  I do not like them Sam-I-Am.  (sorry - too much Dr Seuss with my baby).  BUT I DO love theirs.  And don't mind the big chunks one bit.  Their cookie is so well balanced in terms of sweetness.  I would definitely get this again.
