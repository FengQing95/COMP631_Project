JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Ok so I'll admit that before I just considered this place to be low quality compared to other ramen joints in Houston, and only came here when I planned to spend the night out in midtown. But recently I decided I'd torture myself and try and be a vegan and was DELIGHTED to find out Jinya has a vegan bowl.
