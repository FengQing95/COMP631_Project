Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Overall we really liked this place. Nothing was stressful about it (parking, lines, finding seating) which seems like a big cause of some of the lower star reviews. My friend also noted he usually gets a migraine from the strong smell of bakeries and old food smells but Common Bond smelled fresh and really not like anything. It's a good thing.
