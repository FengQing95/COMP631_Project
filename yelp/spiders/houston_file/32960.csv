Local Foods////I think I've probably been to Local Foods more than I've been to any other restaurant in Rice Village combined. The food always taste very fresh, and even though it's a little bit on the pricier side, you definitely get a lot of food. I usually get a sandwich, which comes with two sides. I always leave stuffed, but not in a bad way. You really can't go wrong with any of their food. My personal favorites are the market veggie and smoked salmon sandwiches, and my favorite sides are the cabbage slaw, acorn squash, and tuscan kale. The staff is also really nice, the decorations are pretty cool, and there is indoor and outdoor seating (although I'm really sad that they removed their one bike rack, even though it was pretty awkwardly placed; but where am I supposed to put my bike now?) Overall, it's one of my favorite places to go with my friends, either for lunch or dinner (or both).
