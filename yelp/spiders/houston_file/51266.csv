Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Arrived at Snooze about 15 minutes before they close because I brought my mom who was in from out of town. She heard about this place and really wanted to try it. We were sat with no problem. My mom ordered the sausage gravy, corned beef hash, and omelet. The gravy was more of a thick casserole opposed to a gravy. It had carrots and celery in it which was interesting for a breakfast gravy. I had the spud deluxe with bacon and sausage which was great. The best thing was the server informed me that lost their items can be ordered in half portions which was great because the spud deluxe was huge! I also had a half order of the neat French toast and it was great!
