Uchi////I ordered few dishes that a couple who sat next to me at the sushi bar recommended. I figured why not because they dined here a few times.  They raved about the ham and eggs; and the baby romaine salad dip.  The ham and eggs were okay, quite filling and I kind of felt groose after.  The lettuce dip was not my cup of tea.
