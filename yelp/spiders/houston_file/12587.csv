JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Jinya may be a chain restaurant, but they still delivers like an up-and-comer. They provide quality ingredients with decent size portions. You can't go wrong with the traditional chicken or the spicy chicken ramen. Â It's been quite a task to find another ramen spot that's as good as this one.
