Uchi////The anticipation and wait was all worth it! Uchi is hands down, dare I say, the best and hottest sushi restaurant in town. I can honestly say I like everything about this place. From the complimentary valet service, to the modern yet down to earth vibe of the building, all the way down to the superb customer service, this place simply blows me away. (And we haven't even started talking about the food yet.)
