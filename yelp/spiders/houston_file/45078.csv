Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Private lot on corner. Nice interior. Â I only come weekday mornings. Delicious looking pastries and bread. I've tried all their various croissants and croissant-like pastries, also their macarons are unique (fig & goat, gingerbread, apple spice pie, peppermint, guava, fruity pebbles,etc) & delicious. Their lavender coffee is good. Spice or gingerbread coffee I didn't like. Their breakfast menu is good, pricey but good. & I've tried most of them. The egg in the salsa with Napoles was delicious. Service is good. Order at the counter , get a number, and they'll bring it out to you.
