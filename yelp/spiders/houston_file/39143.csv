Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Great atmosphere! I came in on Tuesday first time there and the server was amazing I forgot his name unfortunately but he was great with menu knowledge and recommended us the special. $20 for a steak, Mac and cheese, and green beans it was huge! Oh and included a side salad. I couldn't finish it all but it was delicious. I also ordered the cheese and chicken dip as an app and omg that was soooo good! All around attentive service and yummy yummy food.
