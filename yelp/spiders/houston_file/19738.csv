Uchi////The first pro is that they have complimentary valet (which is always a bonus!). As soon as we walked in, they had our table ready within a few minutes. The wait for people who did not have reservations was about 30 minutes (at 8 PM on a weekday, which isn't too shabby). As soon as we sat down, we were greeted by Dustin who was a lovely addition to the whole dining experience. He was just as excited to share his recommendations about the food as we were to eat it! He gave us warm towels to wipe our hands with and then a menu. Immediately, we noticed both vegetarian options but also their regular options. I had already scoped the menu out earlier so my eye was on the brie ringo. There is an option for a 6-course vegetarian mean ($70/2 people) but we decided to make our own. BEST IDEA EVER.
