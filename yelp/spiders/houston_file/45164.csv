Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Where to start? Okay so this is counter ordering with table service. First up ordering pastries which no brunch is complete without. Go for the chocolate croissant or cranberry scone... yummy. Next up dessert choice, who doesn't want to violas a dessert before a meal... perfect set up. At the register, order food. Go for the tamale Benedict.... yea I said it, tamale. True masterpiece. The quiche and steak salad were equally impressive and I had a tiny bit of food envy with the sandwiches that were rolling by me. Overall, expect crowds on the weekends but well executed food and service.
