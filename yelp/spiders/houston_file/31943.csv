Local Foods////Driving around Rice Village and craving a refreshing beverage, I took a flyer on the new benjy's venture, Local Foods. Located right next to the original benjy's, Local Foods is a casual, takeout style joint. In an homage to former tenant Antone's, Local Foods left the nameplate doormat. Or maybe it was just too expensive to remove, I don't quite know.
