The Pit Room////Maybe the best BBQ inside the loop, and gives the big three of Gatlins, Killen's, and Corkscrew a run for their money...oh and really no line when I came for lunch on a glorious early Sunday Afternoon.  Order up front, and pay.  They even have a few good beers on tap.  512 Pecan Porter goes particularly well with some BBQ.  Some wood tables scattered about, and some seating outside.  I heard that people will be able to order from the bar next door and right on over the BBQ will come (they might already be doing this).
