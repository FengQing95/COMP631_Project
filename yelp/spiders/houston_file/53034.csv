Kata Robata////- Hamachi Kama (Yellow Tail Collar) - I don't usually ordered fish (unless it's sushi) but this was really good. The fish wasn't dry and didn't have that fishy smell at all. I was really surprised also at the amount of meat there was! Also the grilled skin was so crispy and flavorful (asians love the crispy skin of any animals, haha)
