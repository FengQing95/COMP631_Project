JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. This was the very first place I've ever had ramen from & ive never found another place that's compared. I'm from San Antonio Tx and unfortunately we don't have one there so any time i come to Houston or Austin i make Jinya a for sure stop. I always get the Spicy chicken ramen & add corn and a seasoned egg. Their spicy creamy shrimp tempura is also the best. I highly recommend this place and always visit when I'm in town at least 2 times.
