Baby Barnaby's////Came here for brunch on Sunday, had to sign in on a clipboard and wait for a table to clear up but boy oh boy, that wait was so worth it! Those green eggs(scrambled eggs with spinach, artichoke hearts, jack cheese) served with yummy chicken apple sausage, potatoes and wheat toast were the bomb!! This place is my new favorite brunch spot! The servers are super friendly! They have fresh squeezed orange juice-so refreshing! The place is tiny and parking was a little bit hard on the street but like I said, it's worth it! Love, love this quaint Â place!
