The Pit Room////That was the best barbecue I've ever had.  I'm not from any place that would qualify me to judge barbecue, but it was dynamite.  Brisket was not too fatty, but not dry, and not tough.  I also had the pork ribs, who's were as good as any pork ribs I've ever had.  Both had the perfect amount of smoke.  I had beans for the side, and they were the best damn pinto beans I imagine could be made in the world.
