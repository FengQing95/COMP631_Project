Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////It took 20 minutes for us to be seated even though there were only two people in front of us and no wait. Once we were seated it took about another 12 minutes to be greeted by the waitress. The food was all right, but some of the limes Â that were brought to the table with the food we're old and turning brown. When this was brought to the attention of the manager he shrugged it off rudely before walking off. There's too many good places to eat that are both tasty and friendly to waste your time at this location.
