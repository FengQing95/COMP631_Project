JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I've only been here twice, but I have to write a review for this place.  On a Tuesday night, this place is packed.  We are always waiting to devour some good ramen, but let me tell you this... it's worth the wait.  So far, this is one of my favorite ramen places in Houston.  The broths are very flavorful and you're super full after a bowl of ramen from here.
