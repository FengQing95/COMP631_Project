Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Common Bond is such a wonderful bakery in terms of food, ambiance, and service. All their sandwiches are delicious and unique, except maybe the egg salad (which I thought was pretty bland). Try their chocolate chip cookie, as it was voted one of the best chocolate chip cookies in Houston. I also highly recommend their almond croissant. Seating can be a little hard to find if you come at peak times.
