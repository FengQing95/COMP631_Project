JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I have high expectations from ramen places in Houston, especially with Jinya considering how popular they are but in my opinion it's pretty good but not great ramen. The chasu and egg were nearly perfect. I was expecting the fried brussel sprouts to be similar to Uchi or Tatsuya but these Jinya brussel sprouts are battered and fried and have no flavor. I prefer the Uchi and Tatsuya versions that have a lot of fish sauce umami yumminess. The tonkotsu black ramen was not as flavorful as I wanted. The broth ended up being kinda bland, and I didn't finish my bowl which never happens with me and ramen because I don't waste food. I left Jinya still hungry.
