JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////I ordered the Wonton Chicken Ramen. The flavor was delicious and the presentation was nice. What I immediately noticed though was how mine hardly any liquid. It just looked like a bowl of noodles with sauce. I know you can order extra, but there really wasn't any to start with so that was kind of disappointing. The wontons, however, were soooo good.
