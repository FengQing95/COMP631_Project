Local Foods////I really like the idea of using food products from local farms around Houston. The place seemed very hip and cool with high ceilings, which gave it an illusion of spaciousness. In reality, I felt like it was a bit tight with the different types of seating scattered around, but if you like sitting elbow to elbow with your neighbors, you'll make friends. Then again, there were just a ton of people there, which tells you that people obviously enjoyed this place.
