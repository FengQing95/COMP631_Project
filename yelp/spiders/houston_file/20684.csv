Uchi////Brussel Sprouts (cooked) - before you curl up in revolt, these tiny cabbage heads were cooked crispy on a griddle and marinated in a certain "ramen noodle" type seasoning that was a refreshing alternative to the regular edamame and seaweed salad or regular sushi places. Surprisingly delicious!
