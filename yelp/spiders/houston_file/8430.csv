JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////The Houston location is JUST AS GOOD AS THE BRANCHES IN LOS ANGELES. I'm not kidding. In fact, I might like it even more since I'm a huge ramen fanatic from Southern California and Houston is definitely lacking in good ramen options. In the two short months I was in Texas, I made my way to JINYA five times.
