Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////First Review: I am finding it hard to begin on this review!  If you have ever been to a restaurant and had any and all expectations blown out of the water that is what you will get at snooze!  Service: Great!  Food: Words can not describe the party that was going on in my mouth! Atmosphere: It was like seeing a great friend that you have not seen in a few years!
