Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I came to snooze today, still here finishing up my coffee actually. I decided to come alone for this experience around the 9 o clock hour. Parking was ok, i lucked up and found a person leaving out of the tiny parking lot and was able to snag a space. Upon entering i was seated at a table immediately. I was greeted by my waitress shortly after and noticed it was not super busy. The drink menu is unique and some of the breakfast options, i was in the mood for corn beef hash so i ordered w over medium eggs and 1 bourbon pumpkin pancake. The portions are ok, just enough. I noticed outside of taking my order my waitress seemed pretty checked out and not very attentive to me. I had to catch her while she was at another table just to get a refill for water. I cannot say i would ever wait the 45 minute weekend wait that i hear about or return anytime soon, for a breakfast entree, coffee, and 1 pancake, my total came to $18. Worth to try out but i would not say it's my favorite. For that amount at a Â breakfast place, the service should be outstanding.
