Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was cold when it got to the table and the restaurant was 1/2 full.  We went early on a Friday morning to beat the rush and I really regret not getting another hours sleep.  Although the selection is interesting, it did not make me want to come back.  Don't waste your time or money.
