Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The long line that you'll likely be greeted with can seem intimidating, but rest assured it moves fast.  Even on a Sunday during the brunch rush, I was through it in 10 minutes.  The team at the counter is friendly and fast, and their white fedoras add a necessary French twist to the ambiance.
