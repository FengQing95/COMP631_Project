Uchi////I don't even know the names of most of the things we ordered. But I can tell you this: I hadn't had half of it before, and there was NOTHING I didn't like. So be adventurous here. They're most likely not going to serve you anything you don't like. I'd definitely come back for special occasions. I think the wife is already clamoring to return...
