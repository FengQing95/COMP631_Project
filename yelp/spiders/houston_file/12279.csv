JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////JINYA has a great atmosphere and good food. Big portions, as well as many customizable plate options offer variety and flexibility. Prices were a little on the high side for an Asian bistro, but not terribly bad. A limited, but unique cocktail menu with imported Lychee liquor offers a refreshing change of pace. Unfortunately, for me JINYA lost the 4-star rating due to the lackluster service. The place was relatively busy, but our waitress was rude, inattentive, and unprofessional. Other than the service, I would say JINYA is a great option if you're looking for a modern ramen bar.
