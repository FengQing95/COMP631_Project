Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////THIS IS 1 OF MY NEW BREAKFAST JOINTS!! Jackson was super gracious, knowledgeable and attentive! I ordered a hot chai latte with easy cinnamon sub coconut milk. Then I ordered the snooze burrito, side order of hasbrowns and it was DELICIOUS! I'm soooooooo happy the portion of the burrito wasn't light because I'm all about huge portions.
