Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I love good pastries and desserts so last night 10/2 decided to look on Yelp for the best places in Houston to go get a coffee and some yummy sweets and looking at all the great reviews I choose this place. I made it just in time, actually they were closing but the awesome guy (Adam) let me in so I could buy something to go!! I was the happiest kid on a candy shop lol! No, seriously! my eyes were wide open and shinning looking at everything they had, I was all smiles...I just was SO exited omg! Lol!! People was staring at me because I looked like an idiot who's never seen pastries before lol!!!
