Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Love this place as long as you can stand a wait but it's worth it. They even serve coffee or you can order a drink from the bar as you wait. They have bags outside too to pass the time. The food is worth it- I ordered a skillet and a bloody mary. Really amazing food and cool atmosphere for brunch.
