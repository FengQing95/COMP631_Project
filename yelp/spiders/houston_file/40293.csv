Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Made reservations for a Monday dinner night here in the Riveroaks. Awesome ambiance and excellent wait staff. The food was delicious! Started the evening with a Manhattan, then the pork belly poutine, and then the strip steaks (cooked to perfection), accompanied with their spicy mac & cheese and fresh green beans. All of it was delicious! Not one complaint. We will be back!
