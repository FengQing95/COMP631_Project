JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is my favorite ramen bar! The food is amazing, lots of selections and the staff is always really nice. The restaurant itself is a little small so going on the weekends is a hassle since there is usually a pretty long wait but its totally worth it. It also has really good drinks!
