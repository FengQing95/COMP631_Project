Local Foods////Want a meal where you don't leaving feeling bloated or about to have a heart attack but yet still as satisfied as you could be from food?  This is the place.  I've only been a handful of times (their hours make it difficult) but everything I've had has been damn good.  I'm not even going to list them cause it's just all good in the hood.  It's hard to find a place that has healthy food that taste good.  This place is more about being organic and stuff but it's on the more healthy side so I consider it.  Decor is nice, with a small patio outside.  Might be hard for large groups as well.  Not the cheapest food but well worth it.
