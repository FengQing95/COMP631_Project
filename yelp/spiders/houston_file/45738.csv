Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Love the variety here- choice of sizes for very generous sandwiches- hot chicken delishâ€¼ fresh, vibrant flavors & and baked goods that go straight to my waist, just by looking at them, better to eat, not just view. excellent place to hang , not be rushed, work and get excellent coffees.
