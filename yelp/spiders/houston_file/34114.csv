Local Foods////Nice location and place. Nice, fast and friendly service. But the food and reviews are overrated. I had the salmon sandwich and it was okay. The slaw was Asian inspired and bland, so was the potato salad. My husband had the roast beef and he said it was good. We spent $30 for 2 sandwiches and sides and a ice tea. Will I be back? Most likely not, but it was a good experience.
