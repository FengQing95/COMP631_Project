The Pit Room////Update from my March posting...today's (May6th @8:00pm) visit is a one star due to the raw sausage pictured here. Knew right away it was raw meat as soon as I bit into a slice. My husband & I ordered the two meat platter and we typically share so he placed some sausage on my tray and began to eat...the middle was totally cold and raw-soft like tartare. One star also attributed to the condiment bar being unkept - no cardboard boat containers, no cup lids, and no condiment sauce cups, and the bathroom pail overflowing with trash. Lemonade dispenser drip cup was full and spilling over. Not the quality I have experienced from my 4 prior visits. Really needed a lot of TLC. When I brought the raw sausage back to the BBQ meat server he paused at the fellow next to him serving the sides and did not apologize but just offered me another pork rib. I was dissatisfied and could not finish my meal.
