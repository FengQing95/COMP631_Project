Uchi////As everyone has said before me, Uchi is amazing! One thing I have to add is the Jasmine Cream for dessert. The fried milk dessert was great like everyone said but very sweet with the chocolate, caramel, and ice cream. If you don't want such a sweet dessert, I recommend the Jasmine Cream instead. The granola at the bottom gives you sweetness and the cilantro at the top balances it out for a very refreshing dessert.
