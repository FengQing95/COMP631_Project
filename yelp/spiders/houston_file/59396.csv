Baby Barnaby's////Service was perfect, 80s music was perfect, ambience was perfect and food... Beyond perfect. I had the green eggs and will never get anything different. I was surprised by how delicious the potatoes were, as well. Husband had Migas and little man had a waffle. All plates were just about licked clean - that's a good sign, right?
