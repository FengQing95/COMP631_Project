Uchi////+ Ham & Eggs - katsu pork belly in a roll sprinkled w/ espelette powder accompanied with 3 different sauces (beer mustard, a yolk custard sauce and I think the other one was made with an egg white?). The pork belly was tender, juicy, and just the right about of crispy saltiness of the katsu.
