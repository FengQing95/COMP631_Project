Baby Barnaby's////There are some places where the food is SO good you HAVE to leave a review while still in the location. THIS is one of those places!! As everyone states the service was ALMOST as good as the food!!! I got French toast sausage and eggs and everything was amazing everything tasted top notch!!! My fianc√© got the waffle, eggs, and bacon and just the same! TOP NOTCH!! We will be returning customers for sure! Please give this place a try. ONLY negative was orange juice, it get peeled in the machine but you can tell the orange peel "juice" gets in there slightly, it's not terrible but if you're expecting like store orange juice you may be disappointed!!
