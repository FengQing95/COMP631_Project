Uchi////Overall, INCREDIBLY pleased! The food was light but filling. Even though we got a lot of food, we did not feel overly stuffed and lethargic. Once again, while the main dishes would probably be more satisfying with fish, the whole overall vegetarian experience was a pleasant surprise and I will definitely be going back again for it :)
