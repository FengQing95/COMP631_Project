Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food itself is pretty good.  I tried two of the different eggs Benedict options.  The classic was really flavorful and the one with barbacoa was good but not great. The hashbrowns on the other hand were a bit of a let down.  While a nice sized portion they had little flavor.  I also opted to get a half order of french toast for an extra $5.  The French Toast was quite delicious and if I go back, I'll just go with that.
