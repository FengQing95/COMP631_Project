Local Foods////You may find the offerings at Local Foods fresh and inventive ideas the first time you pop in, but after a few times, you might start to wonder why the menu simply does not change at all... Even the sides are basically the same as they have been since LF opened. Don't get me wrong, I love their food, but I just think they could have a bit more range.
