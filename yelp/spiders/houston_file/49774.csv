Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////The food was delightful and the service rocked!! My only turnoff was the coffee :( for a place that has such good food, pairing it with brown water?? Come on guys!! There are so many local coffee roasters who can provide this place with great beans. Instead they have a bitter over roasted cup of brown water?? That's why I gave it 4 stars
