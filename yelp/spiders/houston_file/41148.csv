Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////They have this Rye bread that is to die for.  I love the bread service that you can order too with the homemade jam.  I wish they stayed open later  and I also once saw a single car parked there being towed after hours.  I thought that was a little sad as what are they doing with their lot anyways after hours and that likely cost whomever the cars was $200 .
