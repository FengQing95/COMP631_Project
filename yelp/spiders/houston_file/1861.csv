JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////My family and I are fans of Ramen especially JINYA.  The best, compare to others we've tried through out Houston.  My aunt turned down our offer to celebrate her birthday at a fancy and upscale restaurant to be here instead.  Both locations are too far.  We went to JINYA in Midtown and the wait was eternity (almost 3 hours) for group of 6+.
