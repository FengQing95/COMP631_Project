JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////For Tonkotsu Black Ramen, this place has more of traditional thin straight noodle with broth that is creamy but not too oily (I know some people complain that this is oily but from standard in Japan this is not oily at all). However, it lacks umami, this remains the issue. Also, there is some mismatch with the topping. Topping of cachu is good, but there is some imbalance compared to Tiger Den. So I still have to give Tiger Den the edge. So then what about Samurai Ramen, there Tonkotsu is good, but I think that there will be a split opinion, it is more of a typical that you can get in Japan. So I like it, but it lacks the uniqueness compared to Tiger Den or Jinya.
