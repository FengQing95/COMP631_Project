Uchi////I had the ten course omakase, and it was delicious. It had both traditional nigiri courses as well as fusion dishes. Textures and tastes were all over the map. Sweet, savory, crunchy, fruity, cold, hot, land, sea, we were taken on an absolute adventure. The fish in the nigiris felt like butter melting in my mouth. No fishiness to them, probably the freshest fish I've had. I loved everything we got, especially the dish of king crab with buttermilk and tangerines in it (salivating!). If I could go back and order just one dish, I'd get that king crab. I was also given this brussel sprout dish on the house. They tasted like savory raisins, and it was addicting. Service was solid, the guys who served me were good at pacing the dinner just right.
