JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Oh delicious Ramen. Thin noodles dance on my taste buds as warm broth envelopes my tongue and coats my throat. This is the feeling brought on by the spicy chicken Ramen at Jinya. Add a whole hard boiled egg to the mix (and maybe some spinach to ease your guilt) and were talking about taking your mouth to pleasure town. Need to tone down the spice? The offer varying degrees of heat to suit all pallets. A must try for all Houstonians. I will say that during lunch, there is a bit of a crowd and wait times can be long.
