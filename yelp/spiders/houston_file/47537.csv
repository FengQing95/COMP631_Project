Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I'm gonna start by saying, I'm not a breakfast person. In fact I would say that I hate it, however, hate, is such a strong word. But, healthy living requires a good strong breakfast and thus we found ourselves on a Saturdate morning at Snooze. I was impressed by everything in its entirety- lots of people means lots of yumminess. However, The parking sucked, the wait kind of sucked, the coffee was a little watered down. My pancakes though were a thing from heaven. And I never ever thought in a million years those words would ever come out of my.... writing. Lol. I do want to try some of the other menu items, so I will be back eventually.
