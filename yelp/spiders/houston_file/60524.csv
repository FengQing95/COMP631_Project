Baby Barnaby's////Service: The second time was rather abysmal. I think the waitress was catering to all the outside tables and scurried back and forth. The butter in the dish was liquefied in the sun, and I imagine the half and half was spoiled. Water was refilled sparingly. So not a fan as much of the service, but maybe it was just that time. The food redeemed the service!
