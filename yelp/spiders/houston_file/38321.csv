Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////So, Bosscat has been on my Yelp bookmark list for sometime and I don't know why I waited so long. My girlfriend and I have monthly brunch to catch up and chit chat and today we chose Bosscat. We had already thoroughly perused the menu and as soon as we were seated knew what we were ordering. We decided on 3 dishes to split - The donut burger, the fruity pebbles French toast & the avocado farm chop with bourbon chicken added. We quickly realized the small table we were seated at would probably not accommodate our food if it came out all at once. And of course it did but we quickly figured it out. Unfortunately, the only downside was we really didn't see our waitress much. We saw her at the beginning to take our order, to check on us after others had brought our food out & to give us our check. They definitely have a team approach- different people refilling your drinks, others bringing out your food & picking up empty plates or table trash but it still would have been nice to have seen a bit more of our waitresses presence. Thankfully, the food was good enough to distract me from making this point till review time. We started with the salad. For a salad it was great! The bourbon chicken was a great addition and for me avocado makes everything better. This is a dish I could see myself ordering on my own again. The next dish was the Donut Burger . If you eat the burger as is I could see it being messy. We cut ours in half to share and used a fork and knife. So, the combination of the sweet donut, the creaminess of the fried egg with the savory of the bacon and ground beef was a pleasant combination and it paired well. My only thought is if it is really a $15 burger or not. Sides are extra if wanted.  Then lastly, the Fruity Pebbles French Toast that they are known for was up. Oddly, delicious combination of fruity pebbles with a sweet condensed milk as a syrup replacement. I was never a cereal lover as a kid and for some reason I was totally vested in eating the crunchy fruity pebbles. Now the one thing we hadn't planned on was the ambiance. When I say the vibe is great I mean it. The best way I can describe it is a cross between a rustic farm type decor with a prohibition feel. The whiskey room is quite impressive. I love that each whiskey is respected enough to have its own shelf!! It makes for an unbelievably fantastic display even if you aren't into whiskey. We ended up having PJ, the general manager stop by our table & he struck up an energetic conversation with us. He offered to show us the room and then proceeded to tell us about the entire concept of the bar which for us information nerds was exhilarating. PJs conversation really made us want to come back to try whiskey pairings and find our whiskey match!  Overall, we had a great experience. The service was mediocre but PJs attention at the end of our visit made up for it. And lastly the food lived up to our expectations. Great place for girls day brunch, great place for couples to meet up with other couple friends for dinner, etc. This place has so many reasons to visit. I can't wait to return & introduce others to this bar!!
