Kata Robata////--Chef's assorted sashimi for two- this came out on a huge platter with a bed of crushed ice. Very impressive display. All of the sashimi was great quality and super fresh. The platter came with raw shrimp and our water took the head and deep fried them. I didn't even know that shrimp heads were edible, but I did eat them. Not my everyday kinda food, but it was fun to try them.
