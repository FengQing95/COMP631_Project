Local Foods////I find it amusing that on Google maps, the description for Local Foods includes the mention of "overstuffed sandwiches." They surely do put a lot in there but they certainly aren't overstuffed by any means. My family and I ordered the smoked salmon, seafood, roast beef and duck confit sandwiches. All solid choices with an assortment of sides--kale, beans, olives, etc. or your choice of soup. In retrospect, I think getting the non-soup option would be better with a group if you choose to share but if you're by yourself, I'd go for the soup route. They only had two options the day I visited and the one I chose was chicken based. There were some chunks of chicken but not as much as I had hoped, a measly 2-3 pieces of meat. The flavor though was excellent with the right amount of spices and the vinegar they added gave it an extra kick.
