Local Foods////Awesome location, very nice environment, fast service. Although the food is not that great. The Taco salad, doesn't look very appetizing, the Banh MÃ¬ it's not good. Way too spicy, onion with a weird cream (Banh mi don't supposed to have onion with that weird cream). I would go to that place just to stay and maybe a coffee but definitely not to eat, way better options around the area.
