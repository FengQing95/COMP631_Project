Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////I heard about this place on Instagram and the food looked absolutely scrumptious! Booking a reservation was simple however service was EXTREMELY slow. Our server stopped by our table maybe four times within a two hour span. Which also isn't great since they only let you stay at your table for 2 hours before kicking you out. All in all the food was mediocre, I definitely had to add some seasoning. And overall it just isn't worth the hype in my opinion.
