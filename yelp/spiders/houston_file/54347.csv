Kata Robata////Kata Robata is a beautiful restaurant, the crowd is always good, especially during lunchtime you get the power lunch crowd who work in River Oaks offices. The service is fast and it's easy to get in and out within an hour. Even though they have a private lot (shared with other businesses), it's not always easy to find parking. I always try to come right around noon or earlier to avoid the rush.
