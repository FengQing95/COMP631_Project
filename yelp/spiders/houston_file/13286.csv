JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This is one of those places where I don't want to share how amazing it is.  I don't want to compete with my fellow Yelpers for reservations! But Alas, it is so fantastic, it deserves an honest review.  We come here on our many treks to MDAnderson from Dallas 4-6 times a year.
