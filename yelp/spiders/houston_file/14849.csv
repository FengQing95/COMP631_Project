JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Love this place. It has a fun communal vibe, but can get loud at times with the music + people. The first time I came here, I got the brussel sprouts and vegetable ramen soup. Brussel sprouts were a hit, but the vegetable ramen was pretty bland and not memorable. Came here after several years, and was excited to try their spicy creamy vegetable ramen. It...is...so....good. I've come back several times after Â just to eat this and I definitely can finish the whole thing without any problems.
