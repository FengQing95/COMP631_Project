Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Fruit croissant and vanilla latte $5.00 for the croissant and about $3.00 for each latte. Split the fruit croissant as most of the pastries here are pretty large. LOVED the vanilla latte and the outdoor seating on a Saturday morning. The lines are long but they move quickly. Turnover and cleaning of tables is also pretty quick. Would love to come back and try their brunch menu.
