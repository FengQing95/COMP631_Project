Baby Barnaby's////Not only is the food wonderful, the staff is SO FRIENDLY and they make you feel like you are at home. The owner is so sweet and makes you wish that all people loved their job like he does. Make sure you get there early, and be prepared to share your convo and/or eggs with your neighbor :)
