JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////This trendy spot has, quite literally, the best ramen I have had outside of Japan. The broth is rich and the noodles have perfect consistency. My go-to is the spicy miso tonkatsu with a side of cabbage and onsen tamago (egg). My husband likes the spicy chicken ramen. The Jinya bun is fabulous and a must-try (I recommend one per person - an order only comes with one). Ramen portions are huge - we always have leftovers. The dessert selection could be a little better. The place is typically pretty busy, especially for dinner and on weekends. They don't take reservations, so there is often a short wait, but there's a small bar up front so that helps. Have been about 7 times - service has always been good. Parking can be challenging at times, but there are 2 garages on the side streets with free valet and it's about a 1 minute walk, so not bad. Definitely recommend - it's the best ramen in Houston.
