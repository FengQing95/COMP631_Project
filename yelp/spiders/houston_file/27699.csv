The Pit Room////Some of the best barbecue in Houston- no debate. I get brisket, and then some combination of the turkey and sausage, and Pit Room delivers goodness every time. There usually is a line, but it moves pretty quickly and is well worth the wait. A must-try for any barbecue enthusiast in Houston.
