Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////We stopped for lunch, and I wasn't impressed. We ordered the chicken sandwich; the chicken was overcooked. The potato logs were overcooked. I ordered the pork filled hushpuppies; they were tasteless. The mac and cheese lacked flavor. It was rather disappointing. The best items were the Â whiskey scorched okra and the fried oysters.
