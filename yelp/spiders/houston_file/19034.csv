Uchi////As we examined the receipt at home, we realize there were two things on the receipt that we never ordered but paid for. Yes, it was our fault for not seeing these things at the restaurant. So we raced back to the restaurant, where the waiter told my girlfriend that one of the non-ordered dishes was a comped dish and that was the reason for the small percentage taken from our final total. The other item on the receipt the waiter claims was from an unsettled bar tab.
