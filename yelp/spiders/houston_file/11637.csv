JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Sarah, I appreciate your feedback very much, and I'm a strong believer in listening to customers and learning from our mistakes. Just peruse my replies to our most negative comments and you'll see what I mean. And while there are many aspects to our business that are somewhat out of our direct control, it doesn't mean we stop trying to improve.
