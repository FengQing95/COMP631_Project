Kata Robata////The king crab uni spoons maybe expensive at $7.50 a spoon, but certainly worth it. The tender and chewy king crab meat is marinated in a light but refreshing sauce that is topped off with a creamy flavor packed uni with caviar on top. The Japanese way of eating everything in a bite, really brings out an umami seafood flavor, but light and very refreshing that you can't resist but get another one. ** it will leave you licking the spoon over and over again.
