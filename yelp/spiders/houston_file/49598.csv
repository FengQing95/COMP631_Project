Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Anyways, now on to the good stuff! I highly recommend the green Chili Verde Benedict with Barbacoa (you can also choose to get it with pork). I personally think the meat can be a bit more seasoned but the tomatoes and hollandaise sauce on top definitely make up for the lack of seasoning and really bring the dish together. The s'mores pancakes are also to die for! I've heard many good things about the corned beef hash as well but haven't gotten the chance to personally try it myself. Overall there are a lot of really good options to choose from here and the dishes never disappoint. (Side note I realized I had more cons than pros for this being one of my favorite brunch places lol but honestly just tryna keep it one hunnit with my fellow yelpers)
