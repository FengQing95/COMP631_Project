Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////Can you tell where all this is going? Fighting for a seat, squeezing past other patrons, attempting to maneuver a small city-stroller through the restaurant, lack of appropriate facilities, illogical parking, mis-matched service and layouts....it all leads to a very unsettling and hectic experience, which is the exact opposite of what should be offered while enjoying a delicious baked good, brunch or coffee.
