Uchi////While the food was amazing, the portions themselves were not huge. And I know 10 dishes sounds like a lot, but I wouldn't consider myself full at the end of the meal. So my only issue is that price for the quantity of food. However, going off of quality, this was a great restaurant that really knows what it's doing.
