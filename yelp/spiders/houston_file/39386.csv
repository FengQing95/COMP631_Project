Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////One of the best martinis I've had! Thanks Bryce and Rustin - excellent experience all in all. Good music too, which made me feel like I needed to go out afterwards though (at 12p). Apparently the wines weren't that great per our companions, but I suspect they just chose badly.
