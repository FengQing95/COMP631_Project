Kata Robata////I don't give Five Stars unless I crave the food.  I crave the Fois Gras.  It is so delicious.  I also just had an excellent dining experience.  I reserved a table for two for 7pm and everything went smoothly.  The extra step they took as a restaurant was to simply call me the next day, just to make sure my dining experience was up to par.
