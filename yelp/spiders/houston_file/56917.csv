Kata Robata////Kata is a warm ambiance place that has a classy intimate atmosphere. Parking is spacious, and the lobster Mac is alright. My go to is the chili soy ramen, Amberjack foie, toro sushi, and chu toro (cuts of a fish), oxtail ramen, citrus salmon, bone marrow, and their desserts are good (green tea souffl√© is not too sweet)!
