The Pit Room////I've never been a huge BBQ fan but I thoroughly love the food here. The brisket and ribs are super tender and well-cooked. Their sauces are good and I love their pickles - it really cuts the oiliness of BBQ perfectly. The first time I came, they hadn't expanded yet to the patio of the next-door bar, but now that they have, seating is not at all a problem anymore. They also ran out of meats the first time I went for lunch but had everything when I went recently. I'm curious as to whether or not they run out of stuff for dinner.
