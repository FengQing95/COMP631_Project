Kata Robata////Appetizers: Boyfriend and I ordered the grilled squid and the kakuni pork belly. The grilled squid tasted like any other grilled squid I've ever had but I wasn't expecting anything different. The Kakuni was delicious though. Yummy, fatty pork belly, extra soft boiled egg, and spinach. This was the BEST part of the meal hands down. Would come back only so I could order this ten times over.
