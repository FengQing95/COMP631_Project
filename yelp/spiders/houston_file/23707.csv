Uchi////The cool thing about Uchi is you can order as you go. They keep the menus in this hidden table compartment, so you can refer back to it whenever. I like to get my must haves first. Then, if I'm still hungry, I can peruse the menu again or just ask the waiter for specials and recommendations. Another great thing is they're all about the customer. They greet you with samples upon entering. At the bar, the sushi chef will at times give you free rolls or other food you might like to try based on how you're ordering. Once, the waiter recommended the peanut butter semifreddo dessert. I mentioned I'd never tried it, but loved the fried milk. He gave us the semifreddo for free to try it out. The customer is truly first at Uchi. Plus, you don't have to break the bank to dine here. Ordering from the happy hour menu is reasonable and a good sampling of what Uchi has to offer.
