Uchi////Decided to finally come here for a special occasion, and boy was it worth it! We did the 6 course tasting menu's - my bf did the regular one, I did the vegetarian menu made vegan. The food was delicious to say the least! Each dish was delicately designed and incredibly flavorful. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and left with full bellies! I would definitely recommend making a reservation on the weekends, you'll get one of the nice booths :)
