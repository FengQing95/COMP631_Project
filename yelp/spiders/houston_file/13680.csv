JINYA Ramen Bar - Houston////Hi Bianca - Thanks for your review. Friday and Saturday nights are arguably our busiest nights of the week. We have wait times that extend up to 2 hours, depending on the size of your party. Even parties of 2 have been known to wait for an hour or more. I regret this is the case, but it's what we have to work with. Hindsight being 20/20, we would have leased a space twice the size that we have, but even 4 years ago that simply wasn't an option.
