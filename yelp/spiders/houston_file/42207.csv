Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////I've come here twice and both times I've tried the egg on a roll. Once with the sesame roll and the other with the croissant for an extra 2$ . I wound say they are both egg-cellent Â however I think prefer the sesame roll. The eggs are cooked perfect it's just so good. The cappuccino is great. The service is great. I need to venture out and try more stuff.
