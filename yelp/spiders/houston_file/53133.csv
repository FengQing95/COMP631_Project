Kata Robata////The Kitchen does a great job, as the best thing we had was the hot pork belly app. The sashimi yellowfin app was excellent and fresh as well. But the rolls were quite basic and lacking complexity. We ordered 2 rolls, and despite craving a third, we weren't impressed with the first 2 to spend another $15-$20 on a third, and we even passed on what sounded like an amazing dessert. Maybe we just chose poorly, but for us it was quite hit and miss.
