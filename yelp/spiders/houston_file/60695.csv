Baby Barnaby's////First of all, the parking is terrible.  They dont even have designated parking, which sucks.  How is anyone supposed to get there.  we had to park in front of some random ladies house.  on the other hand, the food was really good.  on the other other hand, the space is really small and congested.  I like to have some elbow room when i stuff my face, knaww mean?  its a good brunch joint basically.  on the other other other hand tho, dont come here if your claustrophobic or homophobic, because there are a lot of gay and proud LGB decor everywhere.  it is montrose after all
