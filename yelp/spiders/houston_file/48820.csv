Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////So, we attempted to try Snooze again today. We made the mistake of coming here before going to the hospital for an appointment. Do not come here unless you have nothing but time!! The service is very slow. The wait for a table was shorter on a weekday, about 20 minutes. We sat down, and no one even offered us water for at least 10 minutes. By the time we finally got our orders in and were waiting on food, it was time for us to go, and our food hadn't come. We asked the waitress to rush, and get us to-go boxes if necessary.
