The Pit Room////Sorry gotta play my BBQ snob card but.. no, just no. Tortillas were great. Beans are weird. Brisket was slightly above average. Pulled pork was solid. Honestly the best thing on the plate was the homemade pickles and pickled onions. Next time will bring ziplock baggies and take some home. I kid. Also the BBQ sauce had some spice that made it taste to me like Spaghetti sauce. Just.. no no no. Also went inside for a beer and waited around about 5 mins they had 2 bar tenders plus some other person who said they were 'helping out'. No one else was ordering. The helper person said I can help if it involves the machines. No idea what that meant. Is a beer tap a machine? Technically it probably is. I asked for a beer she said sure. She shuffled off somewhere and never came back. I didn't want my food to get cold so I gave up. Maybe if I had a cold beer it would have taken the edge of my BBQ snobbery and I would have landed on a 4 star review somehow. If they did breakfast tacos with eggs and brisket I would probably give that a second shot. GF liked the sausage it was kind of on the dry side for my liking.
