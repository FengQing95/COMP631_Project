Local Foods////When you first walk in, you will notice the unique decor inside. With a variety of different tables, booths, and high, stool dining areas, the inside is just as fun as the food is. The patio area, while also incomparable to the location on Kirby, is also quite nice. At Local Foods, you order from a counter, receive a number, and then the food is brought out to you, so don't expect a full-service restaurant if you happen to eat here.
