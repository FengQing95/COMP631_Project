Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////After reading a bunch of good reviews I talked my friends into trying this place with me for Saturday brunch. The food and atmosphere did not disappoint. I got the veggie omelet and we shared a mimosa carafe for $30. Definitely a trendy spot tucked away in the River Oaks shopping district. My only issue was our waiter seemed to be a little out of it, but we did get there right at 11am.
