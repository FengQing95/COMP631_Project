Common Bond Bistro & Bakery - Montrose////The pastries are good, but the food is over priced.  The reason why Im giving them 2 stars is for the service.  From the time I looked at my receipt to the time I got my food was 33 mins.  They stated something was wrong with the ticketing system.  They offered to give us a pastry on the house, but I did not take it thinking that we were going to get our drinks and food right away.  That took an additional 15 mins and I regretted not taking that offer.  I guess there was a new girl because she took away our number and couldnt remember our number as she was walking around with our food looking for the number (we had ordered drinks and it was already given to us by the same girl).  I tipped them well at the beginning only regretting that as I was walking out the door.  Perhaps I should return another day to get a different experience, but at time time I have no desire to do so.
