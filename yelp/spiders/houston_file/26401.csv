The Pit Room////This is my third time here in less than a month and everything is always perfect, from the customer service to the YUMMY frito pie, the brisket, the ribs and the QUESO!!! I am a queso snob so do not take that sentence lightly. Omg I almost forgot the Mac and cheese!! It was so good that I might have brought it to Friendsgiving and told everyone that I made it (oops). Oh well, everyone loved it and there were no leftovers Â Shout out to Calvin the Asian with the purple hair (his words) and the "pretty white boy"--like I said, the BEST customer service!
