Local Foods////I'm not a big fan of sandwiches but heard so much about this place that I had to try it. And I'm glad I did!!! Urban, cool atmosphere and the food... Hummmm, so good! I ordered the truffled egg salad sandwich with the rustic winter veggie soup. The pretzel bun deserves all the buzz that it gets- so fresh, so amazing! The soup was also really taste. I'll be back many times for sure!
