Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////We had a little issue with one of my friends food. She ordered Shrimp & Grits (which is a pretty popular dish) we aren't sure what happened but she ended up with the wrong order. They apologized and 15-20 mins later she got her shrimp & grits. The shrimp was rubbery and way too cooked, very hard to chew and swallow BUT we knew it was probably a bad little batch because it's a very popular and highly recommended dish. No biggie. It was sent back Â and exchanged for the breakfast burrito. This was not a deal breaker things happen. The service, people, and overall vibe overshadows this small bump. Her food was comp'd which was also a great gesture and very thoughtful.
