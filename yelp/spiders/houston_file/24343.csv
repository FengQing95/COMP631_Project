Uchi////really enjoyed my first visit to Uchi this eve. We were a party of 3 (2 vegans) and I was curious how the restaurant would transfer the fresh, fishy taste of sushi to plant based dishes. Well they managed it magnificently. Beautifully fresh avocado sushi, delicious noodles, lovely tempura. I will definitely be back
