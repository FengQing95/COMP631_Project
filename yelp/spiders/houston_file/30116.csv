The Pit Room////You don't need to drive to Lockhart, Luling, Austin, or Spring. There is first-class Texas barbecue available right here in the Montrose on Richmond. The brisket, pork ribs, beef ribs, and chicken are outstanding (I'm not much of a sausage fan, so I cannot comment). The freshly-fried chicharrones are great, too, as are the house-pickled accompaniments.
