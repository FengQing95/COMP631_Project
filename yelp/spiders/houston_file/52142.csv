Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////Now that that's out of the way, Snooze utilized a "waitlist" feature.  We "logged in", checked in when we arrived and got a text when our table was ready.  We had 13 folks ahead of us, and somehow got seated within 20 minutes.  Due to COVID, Snooze doesn't offer free coffee while you wait.
