Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////On the flip side the fried oysters were amazing it reminded me of homemade fried food the crust on the outside was flavorful. My short ribs was definitely delicious soft tender and flavorful. The risotto was the bestselling thing in my opinion. Then for desert the fried apple pie made my eyes roll because it was sooooooo amazing. I had an amazing brunch experience.
