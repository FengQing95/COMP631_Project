Local Foods////I ordered the crunchy chicken with the lemon grass soup and the asian chicken salad. I came here to eat with my girlfriend and the person that took our order split our orders for us without asking. What a great surprise. The Asian chicken salad tasted like a spring roll with peanut dressing which was delicious! The crunchy chicken had great flavor and the bread was just right. The lemongrass soup had a thai curry flavor. Wasn't thick enough to be curry so it worked perfectly as soup! I will return here later to try that duck confit sandwich soon.
