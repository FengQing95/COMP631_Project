Kata Robata////My wife and I love sushi. We choose Kata Robata for our anniversary celebration, it was a special night. When we arrived we were told the reservation for ourself and friends (party of 6) made a month ago was no where to be found and they had no room for us. After some frustrating discussion it was discovered that they marked the reservation for the wrong month. Room was found and we were seated. Service was attentive to the point what we felt rushed and were advised after approximately 80-90 minutes that we were eating into another parties time. This was rude and frankly unreasonable time expectation for a party of 6.
