The Pit Room////My guy and I split a 3-meat meal. You can also just get 1- or 2-meat meals, but we figured we would maximize how much we could try by doing it this way. It comes with two sides of your choice, so the 3-meat meal was more than enough food for us. Would probably feed two fairly hungry people. They also have options for group meals for 4-6 or 6-8 people at reasonable prices once you split the cost. Would be a great way to try everything!
