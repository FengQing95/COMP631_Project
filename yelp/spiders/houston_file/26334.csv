The Pit Room////Best bbq I've found in Houston. Brisket was cooked perfect and the bark had just enough spice....even better with their sauce. The pork sausage was good too, plenty of cheese and jalape√±os. Gf said the chopped beef sandwich was also very good. Will definitely be back. If you're tired of all the boring bbq places in Houston that are afraid of a spice rack, this is your place.
