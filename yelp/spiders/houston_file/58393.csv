Baby Barnaby's////Great food, Great service, nice fun atmosphere - cozy, and artistic. Very good prices as well. While you wait, they have self serve coffee - it was Sunday at 11am, and we only waited 20 minutes...We were a party of 2, allowed to sit in a booth even though there was a wait. It was my mom's birthday, and we were both very happy. Great fresh coffee - they keep a full carafe that you can use to refill on your own, and a pitcher of water.
