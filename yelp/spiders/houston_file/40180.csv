Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Our Sunday brunch experience was also very enjoyable. On a perfect sunny and cool December morning, we opted to dine al fresco on the spacious and comfortable patio. Once again, all aspects of the service were top-notch. Although you can always have the classic Bloody Mary or Mimosa, I opted for the "breakfast in bed" (Jim Beam Maple Bourbon, fresh OJ, and a nice slice of bacon)...what a concept! For starters we shared "Totchos"...these were the highlight of the brunch for me. Tater tots smothered in chorizo, nacho cheese, jalapeño, and fried egg..so fulfilling! Our party of 4 had the chicken fried steak (in the classic style topped with fried egg), shrimp and grits, the crazily extravagant Donut Burger (see photo) and short rib chilaquiles (just as delicious as the previous visit's short rib). We finished up by sharing the fruity pebble French toast (the name says it all....delish!)  On both our visits, the on-duty managers took the time to come to the table to converse and make sure all was in order. On our Wednesday visit, one of the chefs also came out to give us informative comments on the preparation of our dishes. Overall, I was made to feel like a regular, even though I was a first-timer. If I were to briefly describe BKL, I'd say it's "comfort food...taken to the next level". I'd highly recommend BKL, and I definitely plan to return on my next visit to Houston to try some of the other great looking items on the menu!
