Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////This is by far the best breakfast brunch place I have ever eaten at. The food was wonderful and the presentation was pristine. Great atmosphere and great service. My daughter and I had eggs Benedict served two different ways and both were delicious. The mimosas could have been a little stronger for me but they offer a glass of champagne or Prosecco and a small splash of orange juice for $1.50 more. I highly recommend it!
