Snooze, an A.M. Eatery////I've been here a few times and my only complaint is the wait time. Coming here during brunch on the weekends will result in a minimum hour wait. I came here on a Monday after 1pm and although the restaurant wasn't filled, it still took them almost 30 minutes to seat us. We seen many tables available and even though I know you're short of staff, you could atleast seat us. They were understaffed and we had to continuously flag a server down to get any kind of request or condiments. But enough of that.
