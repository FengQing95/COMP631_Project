Kata Robata////Came here for lunch. Love their yakininku don. The beef is very tender and melts in your mouth. I always ask for the sauce on the side or the rice gets too sweet and soggy. Sushi combo a and c were average. Â I don't like my rolls too thick so it wasn't my fav. I've been here for dinner a few times and love their appetizers and spicy soy ramen.
