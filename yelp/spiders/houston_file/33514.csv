Local Foods////I'm sorry, I cannot get on the local train. My boyfriend and I both gave our meals and thumb down and I usually love places like this! My Bahn Mi was awful. So much sauce that it was inedible. I left it for the trash. My boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich on the pretzel bun. While the presentation was again gorgeous, the taste left something to be desired. The kale was over dressed and the quinoa tasted like the juice in the can of a black beans.
