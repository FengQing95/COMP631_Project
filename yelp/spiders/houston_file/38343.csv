Bosscat Kitchen & Libations////Mouthwatering and unique drinks and food, such a great fun atmosphere inside and out, and excellent servers with great drink and menu recommendations! The whole venue is gorgeous gorgeous, great for families and friend get togethers, romantic dates, business meetings, or just watching a game; I loved that there seems to be something for everyone at Bosscat. And I love the restrooms, especially the BumbleDate plaque informing how to get support from the staff if someone is on an uncomfortable date. That was so great to see and I hope more and more businesses start following suit. I'll definitely be coming back here!
