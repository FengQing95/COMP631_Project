Local Foods////Love it here! Great sandwiches, sides, teas, and sweet treats. My favorite sandwich is the crunchy chicken and favorite sides are the squash, kale salad, and barley. The portions are generous and I usually have leftovers. Given the quality of the food and the fresh organic ingredients I think it's actually totally worth the price and on par to many other sandwich spots. Their panzanella salad is also divine. Plenty of seating and free parking in the lot. Gets busy during the lunch rush but service is fast and friendly.
