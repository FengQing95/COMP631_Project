Uchi////Look, I'm hard to wow when it comes to restaurants, however I think I was just treated to the most unique, inspired Asian flavors EVER.  It's one of those experiences that I was so blown away with, I can't describe it.  You have to go try Uchi if you've never tasted food that knows no boundaries but the skill of the chef.  This place doesn't fit any mold, it creates its own environment.  We opted for letting our server decide what he liked and to keep bringing food until we said stop.  Unbelievable, there wasn't one thing we tried that didn't knock our socks off and kept us asking our multitude of servers "what was that again"!  This is a tough reservation to get, but worth it for the knowledgeable foodie crowd in Houston.   If I had to make a recommendation on the top 5 restaurants for people visiting Houston, this one just crowded on there in my book.
