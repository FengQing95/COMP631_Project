Local Foods////The crab and shrimp sandwich was amazing. They really do not skimp on the ingredients at all and the bread paired perfectly with the type of meat used. We also ordered the short rib which I wasn't a huge fan of. The soba noodles tasted like cake icing in my opinion. So we only order the quinoa sides now whenever we go. The sandwich is huge, I would suggest sharing one if you do not eat a lot.
