Uchi////Came here for HH at 5:00pm for the first time ever and the line for HH was out the door and wrapped around the building. The line did move fast however but I had no idea people were so crazy for their HH. I've only been to Uchiko and it was their Austin location and there was definitely no line out the door when I went. Oh I took some time driving around for parking but there is complimentary valet right in front of you next to Uchi. Got to love valet and not stressing about limited parking space on Westheimer.
